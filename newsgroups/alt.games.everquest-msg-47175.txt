/agree
This applies, I think, to most *all* tradeskills. Particularly
blacksmithing. After watching Tiru trying to grandmaster smithing to
make her full suit of cultural imbued whateverthefuck dorf armor, I
don't want to *think* of the amount of plat she's flushed into it. And
you don't even want to *whisper* the words "lava rock" around her unless
they are preceded by "would you like a", or you'll be permanently on the
"no rez for ju!" list.
