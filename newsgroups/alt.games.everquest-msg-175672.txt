I am a software developer and am aware of the beta test process,
although not on a large scale as SOE has on its hands. I agree with
all of your points. My point was that they seem to be skipping a vital
step in that process you outlined. You mention that certain things
will slip through. Of course this happens. ALways will. Until the
masses can have at it, who knows what will happen, and that only
happens after release.

You bring up a point about a change in crushbone that went unnoticed
on the test server (among other changes). Im not familiar with the
communication SOE has with its players on Test (i do enough bug
hunting at work, dont really feel like doing it in my spare time
either lol). But this is brand new content, not a change to an old
zone. These should be made known on the test server so the players can
specifically focus on the new features/zones etc. Thats the point of
the test server and players there should be expected to do this (not
just to be able to play on a nearly empty server).

This brings up a good point about testing. Software designers and even
to a degree, professional beta testers arent always the best bug
finders. They WONT find everything. When you design a system, you know
how it works and how its supposed to be used. The greatest challenge
in programming is anticipating how everyone will use your software.
Its impossible to predict what everyone will do. I can recall a while
ago here at work, i released a program to beta test to a few users. I
had done internal testing quite a bit. I could whip through the
program with ease and efficiency. In the hands of other users, they
fumbled through it - it was kind of embarrasing. But they used it in
ways I hadnt. They approached it with no knowledge of its design, and
found many things I hadnt. If you can fool proof a program in the
hands of fools, then youve done your job.

My original point was that, they seem to be rushing this expansion
out. No word of external beta (that ive heard). No "fools" (no instult
intended) stumbling on things the internal testers wouldnt find. When
they HAVE done external testing, there are STILL major issues that
turn up once it hits the masses. Without the phase of a limited
external test, how many more issues will appear that maybe wouldnt
have if an external test was made?
