You don't make a few handbaskets in China, and then rush off to the Alps 
to get in on a yeti kill, and then run back to china in time to catch an 
expedition to kill sewer ratsm, even in an era of jets/aircraft.

Given that one could get from absolutely any zone in the game to any 
other zone in the game in under 60 minutes, without relying on teleports 
of any sort your suggestion that you need play all the time to travel is 
ridiculous. Yes it was an obstacle, and yes, if you were on a really 
limited play time, you might log in and set as your goal... Today I'm 
going to move my base of operations to Kelethin, or to the Overthere 
Outpost, or to Thurgadin.

Further, your suggestion that you be allowed to travel while not in the 
game is very intriguing. In principle I'd fully support it, you'd head 
to town, book passage on a caravan, and an hour or two real time later 
you'd be at the destination city, whether you were logged in or not. 

Fantastic idea!

However, out of game travel doesn't solve your problem of being 45 
minutes away from where your group invite came from. Even if you had the 
foresight to log out on a caravan to Thurg, and presumably when you next 
log in, you intentd to play in the Great Divide, or perhaps to check out 
the Crystal Caverns. *But* if you expect to login and join a group in 
the Ruins of old Paineel after putting yourself on a boat to Velious 
yourself you're still screwed. 

And you should be.

You're now halfway around the bloody world. Deal with it and find 
something else to do. Back in the early days, people with time 
constraints didn't spend all their time travelling as you seem to 
suppose, they would go somewhere and hunt there for a couple weeks, and 
then head somewhere else. 

Instead of logging in for 2 hours and spending 1 of them getting to a 
group halfway around the world, they'd spend those 2 hours grouping 
locally, as any sane person would, and once every few weeks they'd make 
a day of getting bound somewhere new and exotic and far away, and that 
trip was an adventure unto itself.

Immersion is the sense that you are in a real world, it comes from the 
minutia of realism obstacles. When you load up on coins and possessions 
they weigh you down, when fight you must rest to be replensished, food 
and water and spell components must be replaced, etc... these are all 
routinely condemned as 'timesinks'.

I have to go the bank! 
What a waste of time.

I'm out food... I need to visit a merchant to buy some. 
What a waste of time.

I'm at half health, its going to take me several minutes to heal back to 
full without a healer. What a waste of time.

I'm out of 'dots... I'll have to go back to Freeport. What a waste of 
time!

If you just want to stand in one place killing creature after creature 
without being bothered by all the minutia play Soul Caliber or Mortal 
Kombat.

The very thing that makes these games different is the inclusion of 
'timesinks' that make you move around, manage your inventory and weight, 
etc etc etc.

A mmog by necessity will have these 'timesink' things. Its just a 
question of to what degree. There is no such thing as a perfect balance 
because some people want more realism, and some people want less. 

The biggest thing people  don't like about EQ is that its *changed* its 
balance. For some people that made it better, for others it made it 
worse. 

But by changing it they've destroyed its integrity for everyone.

> fun? 

It takes far longer to get from level 1 to 65, and every misstep sends 
you back 10% or more of a level. What a colossal frustrating timesink, 
as I ding 25th level for the 15th time...!! Why play a game that is so 
frustrating when the goal of a game is to have fun?

Perhaps because overcoming the obstacle is precisely what makes it fun?

Why is the trip from Freeport to Qeynos more frustrating and less fun 
than the trip from level 48 to 50? The former trip takes much less time, 
and is more scenic!

We won't worry about those people.
