Now that is interesting. I didn't know that. I did a quick Google and 
came up with this little article which anyone following this thread will 
probably find interesting. It's just a single page so have a look if you 
like:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_v._Microsoft

As with so many things in life I guess it's never completely black and 
white. Apple was not perfect either and did not invent the GUI of 
course. But in the course of things, they did as noted above buy their 
way in and they did offer it to people as something they could actually 
use and benefit from first. I didn't realize that Microsoft had licensed 
a great deal of Windows 1.0 ideas from Apple but that just goes back to 
my point that more often than not, I think Microsoft has been a follower 
and not a leader in advancing the state of the art in operating system 
technology for personal computers.
