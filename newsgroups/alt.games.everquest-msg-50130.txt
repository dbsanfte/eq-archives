I am pretty certain that you CAN be teleported to Iceclad without previously
visiting, but it isn't a particularly "safe" TP location for first time
visitors especially if you are at the low end of the level range for the
zone. But Iceclad is also the destination for the boat from N Ro and it
isn't that long a journey.

The other 3 locations on Velious (Great Divide, Wakening Lands, Cobalt Scar)
require you to visit the Ring on foot and collect a ground spawn "Tooth"
from the centre of the ring, and then to carry it around with you. The
"Tooth" respawns ina bout 30 seconds so once you get there it isn't
difficult to pick one up.

Note also that the Wakening Lands Tooth also covers Great Divide, and that
the Cobalt Scar Tooth covers Wakening Lands and Great Divide, so you will
only need to carry one tooth. It is of course much harder to get to Cobalt
Scar than it is to Great Divide.
