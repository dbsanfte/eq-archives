Well, I did give a reason, you just don't happen to agree with it.

Most likely it is because of the message that I can disable now.  At the
time when I first encountered it, I could not disable it.  That made it
slightly annoying, and intrusive on me at the time.  Now that I can disable
it, that has changed I suppose, buy my feelings regarding it have not due to
my first experiences with it.

Well, EQ doesn't go back quite that far.  Judging by posts on the subject in
threads that come up now and then, it appears that there are people going
back to the beginning of EQ that fall on both sides of the issue.

I missed the announcement that Verant made regarding the politeness or lack
thereof on the subject.

I think I spelled it out earlier in the post.
