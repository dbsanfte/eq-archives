Only six months?  After spawning a dragon into the midst of the folks
who were there to help him/her?  Against the explicit instructions of
the leader of the raid that was there to help him/her?  Frankly, I can
see only two possibilities here:  deliberate grief play or spectacular
stupidity.  Either way I don't understand how anybody there would do
a damned thing for the Druid (or that rouge of a Rogue) until sometime
well after hell freezes over.  I mean, I've heard eBay stories that
were considerably less awful than that.

Kaev <--- who would probably put the Druid on ignore forever so as to
eliminate risk of replying to a tell with an assessment of the Druid's
family history and mental competence that would likely risk suspension
or even banning.
