No, you don't know jack shit. I'm telling the truth. Whether you
believe it or not is up to you, but you don't -KNOW- I'm not telling
the truth because you have no proof.

While we did get complaints from Rathe Mts, they were actually rare.
Most came from Highkeep, Paludal, BoT, and so forth. Very rarely were
they for any sort of rare mob. They were generally from people camping
a spot in a crowded area. We got occasional instances of multiple
complaints from the same party, but they generally came from soloers
more than parties.
