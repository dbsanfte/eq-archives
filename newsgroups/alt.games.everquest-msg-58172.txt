Muskie is somewhat a pain to make, and the stats aren't all that... My
SK has just gone through the gator steaks she made during her time in
Oasis and is now eating bear steaks - both have the str boost of the
muskie, and bear steaks are hearty meals (bear meat is sold in Thurg,
IIRC, so no need to hunt for materials). 

Anyway, if I had muskie, I'd just go ahead and eat it. Its main use is
being a feast - there's absolutely no point in force feeding fish
rolls and such just to keep 1 str and some minor saves. I'd also not
go out of my way to make muskie, but for someone with a fishing pole
spending time in lake Rathe, they might be worth considering,
especially for baking skillups.

I have some pickled drake I got for a teleport - the only time I have
that in my feeding slot is when I am working on tradeskills.
