I do the sitting thing quite often with my Beastlord since the 29 point lesser
heal he can cast at level 29 doesn't do a whole lot when he's down to almost no
hit points left.  I don't ask people to heal or buff me, but quite often, just
sitting there meditating and being quiet, some nice person comes along and does
a drive by heal/buff.  Quite often I am afk at the time and don't notice, but
when I do, I make sure I send a /tell to that person to thank them.  As you say,
the shouters annoy me, when most of the time, if they'd just sit quiet and be
patient they might get healed without asking.  Sometimes I think people forget
what patience is.

Only once did my druid ask for a SoW (he's 3 levels away from being able to 
cast it himself).  That was after the 9th consecutive corpse run to WC from RV.
I didn't do a shout, ooc, or auction - just saw someone sitting outside the RV
entrance in Kith, checked the /who list to see if they were a SoW class, and
politely explained my situation and asked if they'd be willing to SoW me for
that corpse run.  Had the person ignored me or said no, I wouldn't have thought
them arrogant or rude.  For all I knew, he could have been out of mana totally
and had just started to med.  At any rate, he was willing and I went and got my
corpse and promptly logged, lest I hit 10 deaths (it was not a good day.  stupid
dark elf npc in WC kept killing me if I ran too close, but that's another
story).  

Anyway, that's my view of this whole druid/sow debate.  Even though my Vah 
Shir BL can't cast it yet, I still get annoyed at all the begging heard via ooc
and shout when he takes a trip to Norrath.  I can just imagine what it's gonna
be like for my druid when he gets to 14.  And not looking forward to 29 when I
can cast group ports.  I see a lot of anon time in my future :)  I can't believe
how often I hear someone asking for a port to a zone that's only two or three
zones away.  So it's not that druids are jerks, we're just tired of hearing the
begging day in and day out, when most of the time if you are patient someone
will zip along and SoW you without you even asking.  I appreciate all the
drive-by buffers and often do them with my BL (ok so he can only lesser heal,
inner fire, and strength buff but to a lower level character, that's still
better than nothing).  Patience and silence often get you what you want more
than begging.
