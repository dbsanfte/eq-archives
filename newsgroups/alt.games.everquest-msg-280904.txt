I think this would be true of most any game.

A group of people who've drifted together with common insterests and 
playtimes near the end game in one title will invariably have a very 
tough time holding it together in a new title.

The low game power level is negligable, coupled with low knowledge, even 
minor obstacles to reaching your friends are insurmountable.  The low 
game purve is huge... slight variations in played time will lead to 
dramatic differences in level. Its almost inevitable that people will 
leave eachother behind. 

Heh... I recall in AO, trying to join up with a friend... he'd reached 
level 9 before I figured out how to get to him... and I was still level 
1... 

He'd said, "I'll just kill some time here until you get here"

I'd expect that if you and your friends had tried to form a new group in 
a UO clone, you'd have encountered many of the same problems.

-regards,
