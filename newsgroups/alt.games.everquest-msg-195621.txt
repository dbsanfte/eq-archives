I wouldn't worry about it too much. My Warrior was in full Crafted up
to 50. I lucked out on several good drops on a Kael raid that were
good upgrades for me, but sucked too much for anyone else to want :).
Currently at 52, I'm still wearing my Crafted Helm and Bracers. I'd
still be wearing the Crafted Breastplate, but lucked out on a smithing
combine and got the Qeynos Human racial enchanted breastplate (AC 26
with a minor STA+). Im currently around AC900 unbuffed.
