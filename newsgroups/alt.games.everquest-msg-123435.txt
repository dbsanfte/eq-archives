As I said in my other post, a necromancer can operate nearly as well
wihtout a pet as with. A necromancer's pet is just another "DOT".
Petless fear-kiting is perfectly feasable. A Magician's pet, however,
is his main tank...

As for druids not having the mana to finish a fight naked, that would
depend on how they're fighting: I can root-DOT a mob and usually not
be down by more than a couple of bubbles of mana throughout the fight.
If the fight goes bad, sometimes it'll drain me. But, in most cases, 3
bubbles is the most I'll spend.
