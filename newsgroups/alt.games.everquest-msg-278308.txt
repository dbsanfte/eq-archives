Therefore costs are not increasing.

Its only to offset "increased costs" when costs go UP. 

Why suddenly nit pick at -my- choice of words? 

Besides I seem to recall the ING Direct bank ad campaign has likened 
their competitors service charges to "picking your pockets". I think its 
an apt metaphor.

Yes. While I don't run a mmog, I routinely work with ISP/ASP business 
models. (Application Services Provider not Active Server Pages). The 
essentials are the same, server infrastructure and maintenance, 
bandwidth, custom software development, customer support, licensing, 
etc.

Sure I'd have been annoyed. But quietly annoyed.
