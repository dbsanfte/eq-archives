Compared to a Lamentation with only 2/10ths of a sec more delay and 3 times
the damage...
I agree that ratio isn't everything or everyone would be wielding
Wurmslayers...what you mean they are? ;�)
OK, if I thought that then I'd be wielding a wurmslayer.

I thoughts that what I'd read but when I typed it it looked wrong and prime
made more sense :�)

Assuming that dex actually effects the proc on it, afaik the jury is still
out on that one, it certainly has no noticeable effect on a Yak in my
experience.
Saying that the buffs I get are more like 20 or 30 stat increase so maybe
the effect is a minimal one and a buff of 100 would make a real difference.
But I do have to say OMFG what a weapon :�)

Thanks for info
