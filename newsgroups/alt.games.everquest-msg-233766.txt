From the shadows, the mysterious dstep <dstep@babaloo.net> (if that IS
his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>"Do not be fooled if the chain letter is used to sell inexpensive
>reports on credit, mail order sales, mailing lists, or other topics.
>The primary purpose is to take your money, not to sell information.
>'Selling' a product does not ensure legality." "
>
>That last bit is in regard to the make money fast variants where you
>were supposed to post one recipe in the body of the letter, supposedly
>then turning it into a "legal selling of recipes list." Obviously, it
>still is not legal.
