As you kind of suggest though it makes no real diff if the npc has a
rusty dagger or no weapon at all. Npcs just basically don't attack the
same as we do, they do get a slight boost to damage maybe if they have
two weapons to dual wield say a couple fine steel but it ends up being
nearly the same if they just have fists.

Not really, the npcs seem to kind of do the same even without delay I
think. A long time ago people used to give orc pawn picks to npcs
which were high delay and like 3 damage and this supposedly made them
easier (if they were just using empty hands) I really don't know if it
did or if verant eventually fixed it.  For the most part though you
are not going to see much difference if you parse your log as far as I
know.
