Hmmm....there was a patch this morning?  That would explain why there were
only 79 traders in the Bazaar when I popped in at 6:10 am PST just to see
what the new targeting stuff was like.

As far as Sebilis and Kael Drakkal go...they were both listed as "DOWN" on
the server select screen.  Perhaps those two were already scheduled to be
down for other reasons, and so weren't taken down for this patch? :-)
