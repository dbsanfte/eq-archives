Well, I can say at least I play nowhere near that amount of time....

It doesn't take into consideration weekends at all. Four hours a day may be
normal for a weekday but on weekends the session can be anywhere from 8-16
hours each day. So I guess 40-50 hours a week is not unusual for me. I don't
play every single day though - sometimes I take a few days off or a week
even.

I am full time employed, and basically with me it has substituted for TV
time. My girfriend sometimes object to my time on EQ - but they spend
similar time in front of the TV during the week so I never understood that
one. I have always been a computer game junkie from C64 days though - and
have gotten so used to the intense "mono channel" intense brain level
activity that any form of multi-tasking stresses me. I can do any one task
very well, but doing any 2 things at once immediately get's my back up. It
can be something as simple as listening to the GF and watching TV as well.

Never used to spend the weekend playing, but since I started to save a few
quid I found it easier to play EQ than going out hitting the piss.
