Just a quick note on this one - wouldn't the wizard be better suited in a 
group where they are nearer the top of the level range? Maybe they've 
changed it since I last played one, but it seemed that anytime I was at 
the bottom end of the level range, I had one heck of a time getting the 
majority of my spells to land on all the mobs we fought that were 
yellow/red to me. A chanter tashing often corrected the problem though.
