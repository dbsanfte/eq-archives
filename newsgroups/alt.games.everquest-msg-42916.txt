Group, group, group.

Also, yes, monks have to stay light, but try to hang on to as much money
as you can, you *will* need the armor and some decent 1hb (especially if
you can get an Essence of Dol, 300pp on karana, secondary slot only).
Monks are not generally not the best choice for a main, as you will find
yourself wanting more and more twinkage up till the mid-20's, and DO get
yourself an evil eye bag or better (8-slot large 70% weight reduction,
essential for FM where giants drop items weighing upwards of 10 stone
that are sellable at vendors for between 10 and 65pp).

My monk is wearing almost full Wu's except where I was able to find
better, and wielding an enameled black mace and essence of dol, total
value on karana about 1100pp, to give you a reasonable idea of the cost.
I hit in the mid-teens and low 20's regularly and have no trouble till I
attempt yellows, which I can take maybe 40% of the time (more often if
mend works). Now if I could just afford a CoT or CoH (800-1000pp)
