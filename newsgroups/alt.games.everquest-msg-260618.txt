As a Beastlord, by the time I was able to work on AAs, I already had
Spirit of Wolf, and Spirit of Shrew (which can be cast indoors and is
slightly slower than run3). So Innate Run to me wasn't all that
valuable to start spending my first AA on. It does take up a buff
icon, which is an issue when you start raiding and you need to
micro-manage your buffs. For raids I am in, this isn't an issue for
me.

Other General AA I find good to invest are Metabolism (I'm not super
rich so eating 50% less is good when I have limited stacks of Hero
sandwiches and Constitutionals heh), and Innate Regen too. Tanaan
Craft is good too if you are the one workin on the Signet Earrings.
