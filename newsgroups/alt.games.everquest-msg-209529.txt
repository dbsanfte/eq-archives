Some game. Roll the dice... born in the wrong African village... spend short
time wondering if you'll die of leprosy before you starve at age 6. Game
over, permanently. Gee... that was fun. Most people play games to take a
break from 'real life'... I know I do.

Who exactly is whining? Your the one complaining that people like that
shouldn't be allowed near your groups... they couldn't care less how you
play. But in the event *you* are lfg, and they happen to be bored and
available... to then bitch that they aren't equipped well enough is
bullshit.  I have never run into one of these 'rp' players who was looking
for a group; there usually looking to help you not the other way around. If
they wanted your help they'd play by your rules. Maybe your experience has
been different??

In your opinion. They seem to be having plenty of fun, playing a game you
don't believe even exists.

What exactly is pompous about being bored to tears in a camp that provides
no challenge? I wouldn't say I fit into this group but even I've walked away
from camps that were so controlled I could sleep my way through hours of
levelling.

By true rp, i mean people actually are 'playing a role', where 'how they
act' and interact with others is more important then equipment or level to
them... etc. Call it whatever you want; a rose by any other name smells as
sweet.

My favourite part is how you assume I'm all of / any of these groups. I've
played the ubertwink game plenty. Unlike you however, I've talked to a lot
of them, and have a pretty good understanding why they play the way they
play... and I respect it.

A few posts ago a wizard claimed he felt it was his 'duty' to join a group
with a fresh KEI... and a 25th cleric mentioned his group expected him to go
and get KEI ... reasonable/unreasonable... that's all perspective... and it
looks like people are all over the map on what they figure is reasonable.

Nobody said it was 'better'.

Most of them are happy to participate in the player econonomy once they've
hit the higher levels.

Every time you group with someone who isn't as well equipped or as competent
as you then you  "foot the bill." Jeez.. I hope you've got better things to
do than keep track of who owes you.

Most of these people I've encountered primarily solo or group with a
particular friend(s) of the same sort. Only getting into larger groups when
its strictly necessary to avoid precisely this situation. Nothing
hypocritical about it. Do you really beleive someone would be so naive as to
reject all twinking/uberbuffing and not be savvy that the guy next to him
has c3, regen, hastes, planar gear etc...?? Don't be a fool.

> In summary:  Your complaint is a pile of hypocritical bullshit.

Only if you assume that these people are utter morons, which is patently
untrue.

Your the one whining how unreasonable they are by not conforming to your
view of what makes someone a 'reasonable' groupmate.

At 10-20th level it doesn't make much difference what your equipped with.
At 60+ level its irrelevant because for the most part they *can* get the
same gear as you.

Its really only relevant during the midgame... and for the most part they
aren't lfg. If they're grouping with you its probably because you asked them
to... so you've got a lot of nerve bitching about them... again maybe your
experience is different... but that's mine.
