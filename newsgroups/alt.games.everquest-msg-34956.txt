Update:  I couldn't verify this in person, since I
tried to do it with a 45 necro helping and we got
swarmed while breaking the room due to her higher
aggro factor (because of her lower level) and we
had to bail out, but several people on the Paladin
discussion forums have reported that the Chief room
in Droga *has* been mucked with in the last patch.

The spawn times are reportedly now 17 minutes instead
of a bit over 20, *and* there is some aggro linkage
that didn't used to exist before, which is causing
people who used to be able to single-pull without
fail to get two or more mobs at a time.

So I wasn't hallucinating the Chief room changes,
they're real.

Now I just need to get to WK and see what's up with
the Ogres that a friend reported were using variable
respawn times.
