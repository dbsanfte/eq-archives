i think people who delay starting there epic quest til they are 50+ are
missing the whole point of an epic quest
i started working on mine at 35, got my first piece, the shield of
falsehood, at 39th, got xp for all but killing the pirate captain in OOT
(very first step), the ranger i was helping camp willy at the time was
getting xp off him tho
