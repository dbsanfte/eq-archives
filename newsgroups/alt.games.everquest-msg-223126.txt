If you like challenging, go for the bard.

Challenging religion choices, thats an odd request.  Bards can be pretty 
much any religion, or none at all.  Veeshan is interesting because bard 
is the only class than can pick it, giving you a leg up in COV, and 
there are some nice bard quest items in SS that would help with.  But 
challenging would be the reverse, making "bad" choices.  Lets see. 
Innorruuk or Cazic Thule or Bertox would probably be the most 
irritating, but really faction isn't much challenge for a bard any  way 
you look at it, once you hit level 12 its pretty much all good.

Personally, I'd go Vah Shir bard, no religion at all I'm afraid, but two 
distinct advantages; Safe Fall which will mitigate some damage from 
running around with selos on, and Lute of the Jahrin Apprentice, a 
primary slot lute you can quest for before you even hit level 10, which 
will make you the envy of most bards even at level 57; to beat it you'd 
need a Lute of the Howler, which I've never seen in the bazaar, or your 
epic, or a couple of the new items which give you string effect from 
somewhere outside your weapon slot.

Even most Vah Shir bards don't know this item exists, since most blow 
off the newbie quest series (end result is a anti sonic wolf weapon, ooh 
ahh), so you dont' have to worry that you'll be taking the common choice 
and will be a clone of 90% of the bards on the server.

Other than that, the differences between bards are minimal, and become 
even less so as you acquire gear like the Mask of the Deciever (DE mask 
drops in LGuK)
