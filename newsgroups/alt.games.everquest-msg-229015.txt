Again, using "guild groups" when the discussion is NBG, and therefore most
likely concerning pickup groups, as guild groups tend to be "NBG" for the
selfish reason of still bettering your own ability to advance in the game,
is more than a little irrelevant.

Beyond that, you were talking about BoT, and there are *always* three monks
LFG at zonein in BoT.  :)

See, BoT.  Anyway, your 20+ example was for the warrior staff.  You have odd
snipping patterns.  You'd remember what you were talking about better if you
left the stuff you're referencing in there to review.

I'm familiar with the area and the drops.  And yes, there's plenty of money
to be made there (not off the pants and belts either).  You're gonna farm
chitin plates and eyeballs until you have enough for that 80-120k staff for
your twink?  And that's the first slot...  Regardless, you're still using a
guild group, and the implication that it's almost a perma-group, as some
justification for supporting NBG in pickup groups.  Why?  The two bear
absolutely no relation.
