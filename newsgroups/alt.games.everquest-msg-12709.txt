A mage's pet is like its tanking partner.  A necro's pet is just something
extra for them.  Mage is like a wizard without the root spell.  Which means
can't kite.   While a necro doesnt' really need a pet because it can fear
kite with or without its pet, with one it just makes killing mobs alot
faster.

A mage's pet it quite versatile.
Earth - Root
Air - Stun
Water - poison Resist
Fire - Fire Dmg Shield  - my own opinino the worst of the four because of
the lowered HP...

I loved my mage until i got really unbearable with medding... it was just
too boring for me.  but if you have alot of enchanter friends in the zone,
it is not so bad. :)
