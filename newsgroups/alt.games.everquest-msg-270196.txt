Ah, but there's the rub.

"I want to change the world!" Wow, cool.
"I want to log in and find OTHER people have changed the world!"
Uhm...less cool.

One of the problems in a dynamic world is that the majority of players
who aren't world-changers wll feel their game is being altered at the
whims of a few uber-guilds and that they have no say in it. The
dynamics of the game tend to concentrate power in a very few hands.
So, if there's a quest which will dramatically alter the world, onlya
small %age of the players will be able to be part of it, and the rest
will be helpless observers. If someone is happy living in their little
elven village, he might be quite upset to find it taken over by
goblins one day, especially when he learns this was done by the
actions of some random guild he never heard of.

In the real world, you have to deal with getting screwed by other
people's actions. In a game -- you cancel your account and go
somewhere else. And I think that, in the long run, most players will
do just that, rather than feel like the world they're paying for isn't
stable. 

A Tale In The Desert has, I believe, a dynamic world where player
actions change the face of the game over time. It's also a "niche"
game with a few thousand subscribers and little chance of breaking
out.
