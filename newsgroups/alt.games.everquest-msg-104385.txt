I'm not sure you would want to take that bet jaZZ.  I don't die that much 
now (other than TPWs now, so no more than 10-15 times a week), but I have 
a HUGE number of deaths CT when it was packed, and guk when it was *the* 
place to be at 35, and soloing anywhere I could find blue mobs.   
I've been pulling a lot more recently, now that I'm 60 and really don't 
caer about AA points, so my death count will start to climb again, 
especially if they revamp VP.  
I actually was pissed about a death this weekend.  I executed a perfect 
solo pull of Klandikar past Glati and one other see-invis dragon, dodged 
the wandering wurms and dogs, get him back to the group, and die 
immediately.  We killed him pretty easily, which was great, but I was 
sitting dead and nekkid in Bazaar missing all the fun.
Oh, one other thing.  Do monks just not die until they start pulling for 
big raids?  I saw our monks lose two yellow bubbles in a single VP raid 
before we learned the zone, and we ended up rotating pullers between pull 
group and KS group to keep them from getting too frustrated.
