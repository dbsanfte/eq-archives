Just you two will be fine.  I was "soloing" the room with my 56 enc & 52
druid though I did something wrong and died...ah well.

Don't just rush in the room unless you and your cleric are both uber.  I
think there's 5 BLUE(!!) or cyan frogs that'll aggro on you if you're KOS.
Having the higher player (pref non-KOS at that point) pull to the hall right
outside his room and you shouldn't get more than 2 at once.

I used my crown, other resist gear, Illusion: drybone skeleton & circle of
winter to get my FR up to 194 last week. <g>
