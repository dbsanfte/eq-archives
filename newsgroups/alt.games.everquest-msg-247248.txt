Differences between a Horse and Drogmor

Motion - with a horse, you move up and down when you gallop.  With a
drogmor, you sway from side to side.  Some players get motion sickness with
a drogmor.
View - with a horse, you will have the head and ears in front of you.  With
a drogmor, as their heads are low to the ground, your view is not blocked
Sizes - Horses size automatically to the character size.  Drogmor speeds are
based on the size of the drogmor, and a large character on a small drogmor
is almost dragging it's feet on the ground, whereas a small character is
perched high on a giant drogmor.
Eye-candy - drogmor's leap.  Some players buy a drogmor for the sheer
novelty of watching the animation of a running drogmor.
