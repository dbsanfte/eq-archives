I actually spent some time today following this story.
Due to the amount of whining and crying the players
did, they actually changed a bunch of rules on that server.

Yeah, it sucks he did it. But there are other alternatives to
take care of Fansy. But instead of finding one, it is always
easier to whine and cry about it till you get your way.

What I'm guessing, is a huge amount of "blue server" people
have moved over to try out the "new server" and hate the rules.
Or lack of them rather.

It was a great idea by Verant. Too bad the kids had to get
their way.
