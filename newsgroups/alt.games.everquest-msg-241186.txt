   Well, don't be shy.  The forum is a bit cliquish, but not to the point of
being scary.

   Was Claviger the one that trained you?

   It doesn't matter, anyways.  He can want that, but that isn't the way it is. 
Believe me, this very issue has been discussed before on the FV, and it comes
down to roleplaying does not justify griefing.  If someone doesn't like an
invasion, they are welcome to duel, hurl insults, or try to raise an army to
invade the invader's home town.

   Actually, I would guess that starting cites get invaded on FV alot more often
than other servers.  It's considered to be good roleplaying, after all.

   I could see it being a bear to program.  And I wouldn't trust SOE to get it
right.
