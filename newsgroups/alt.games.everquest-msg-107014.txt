Hello, we at accessgame.com would like to introduce ourselves.
We are a small site, brand new and growing like a weed.
We are run by a small group of 3 admins (who also play EQ ALOT)
We are growing SO fast that we need MORE people to help post and
approve the content that keeps pouring in.

We are non-profit, so about the only reward we could offer is the
ability to have your own email "yourname@accessgame.com" and the pride
to say you help to run a FanSite.

We are not purely everquest, we deal in AC,AO,DaoC and DarkAges by
Nexxon as well.

We have Stories, Journals, Quest Lists, Spell Lists, Item Lists, Maps,
Live Chat, Forums and coming soon Auctions and Much, Much more!.

Our only goal is to be THE most extensive game site in history for the
games we LOVE to play.

We don't plan to ever charge a fee as one of the admins happens to own
the hosting company.

So if you wish to share in our dreams come join us.
Email admin@accessgame.com and explain why you would make a good
admin.
We will respond to all emails within 24hours.

If you choose not to email, and be all gushy just post in this thread,
but don't post anything too personal.  I'm sure if your grandma was
killed by a Gnoll though everyone would love to hear it :)
Sincerely
Rage Mage 23rd lvl Human Earth (admin for accessgame.com)

p.s. If you would like to check us out and you haven't figured out the
URL it's www.accessgame.com

note to flamers: This is not an ad for the site thats why we posted
the URL at the bottom.
