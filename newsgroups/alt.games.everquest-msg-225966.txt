And what exactly do you think Shaman are, folks that spend all their 
cash on agility items, or feed the whales banquets?

Stamana means HP, and for a shaman, HP means mana, PLUS the ability to 
take a beating. Since shaman do both with astonishing regularity (and 
often simultaneously), Stamina is a primary stat for them.  IF they turn 
it into some stat which doesn't increase your HP, and is only useful for 
"pure melee" then they are going to be unhappy indeed.  Necromancers, 
Paladins, SK, will also be most put out, while frankly every other class 
is also going to be a bit annoyed, since we've long since discovered 
that the majority of stats mean little, and a secondary focus on stamina 
is one of the best choices you can make for -any- class (who doesn't 
want to be able to take a beating a while longer, whether that means 
waiting longer for a CHeal as a main tank, or waiting longer for the mez 
to get it off you if you are a dress wearing wizard, or anywhere in 
between?)

Fortunately, it seems that what is going away is the Stamina Bar, 
perhaps, which means no more silliness about not being able to jump; not 
a bad idea since melee long since discovered that if their stamina stat 
is over 100 then a completely empty stamina bar has no effect on them in 
combat.  Get rid of a bar thats ignored 99.9% of the time?  Good plan.
