You have a point about grouping with a SOW capable character if you
want access, but I don't see anything wrong with either a. Asking a
shaman/druid/ranger for a SOW ONCE, and accepting the reply, yes or no
or b. Offering to pay for a SOW over the auction channel (my preferred
method for trying to get a SOW).

I think the best way to get a SOW when you are a non SOW character is
try to buy some SOW potions from a shaman.  It's a bit pricey, but you
can use 'em at your convenience without bugging anyone else  :)

And, I do play a SOW capable shaman, so I do know what it's like to be
begged at for a SOW by others.
