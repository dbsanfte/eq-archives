Hmm, that makes no sense.  But if it works, well, proccing anything from 
Primal/Prismatic to the DS off my two handed practice sword just got 
much easier.  More amusingly, I could deliberately die, say from a duel, 
and then I'd be able to drag a body around a given zone with me for an 
entire week anytime I was in there, with the new /corpsedrag command, 
using it to activate my "buff proc" weapons as needed.

Soon every zone will fill up with people dragging their own bodies 
around with them!

Course that won't work in zones with a graveyard, where after 10 minutes 
or so the bodies rubberband back in the GY like it or not.
