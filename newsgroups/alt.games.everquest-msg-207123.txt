Back in the day when it was more about the game and less about the levels,
we'd do that as a guild event.  Everyone would create a gnome, hand the book
to the PoD (so we could tell ourselves apart from the other gnomes) and
gather 'round the clockwork beside the entrance to Ak'Anon.  An officer
would be there to tag everyone, then we'd be ready.

On your mark, get set, go!

No ports allowed ... no SoW allowed ... no such thing as a soulbinder or the
PoK.  You had your newbie wep, and that was it.

/gu was a blast those nights.

We'd also have "Naked Troll Runs" from Grobb to Freeport.  First one to get
killed by a Freeport guard was the winner.  This was back when the EC tunnel
was the happening place, and oh, the comments from the folks buying and
selling when 30 or so naked trolls came barrelling through.
