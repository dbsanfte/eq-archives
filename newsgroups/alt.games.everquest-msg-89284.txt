To guild leaders and board administrators...
If you don't like the following post the just remove it. If you feel it may
server some good then please leave it up or move it to the proper forum.
Over the past year or so I have seen Verant do some things that just don't
seem right. Ever since Shadows Of Luclin was released there have been large
numbers of players with problems. If your one of the lucky ones with no
problems that to is good and let us know.
By the end of Wednesday this petition will be posted on every guild forums
site that that we can post to.
Our hopes are to collect as many petitions as we can and let Verant see that
there is a problem and see if they could fix it.
The biggest problem I see is the rush to patch without complete testing.
At this point in time we have gotten over 40,000 replies and they keep
coming in.
I don't want EverQuest players to go play DaoC and I myself don't want to,
but Verant need to know there are more problem than they want to admit to.
I hear lots of good things and lots of bad things about EverQuest but no one
has sat down and taken the time to manage a large number of players at one
time to let Verant know how many are really having problem.
That's the whole reason for this petition, not to get everyone over to DaoC.
Please just let your guild members reply to this good or bad and let us get
a better idea on how big this problem really is.
I fully understand what it takes to run a large company like Verant and I
understand that the service we pay for does cost Sony/Verant allot to
provide us.

Some stats:
Out of 20,000 petitions we have gone through so far 80% will not leave EQ
and 70% feel that patches need a bit more testing.
The EverQuest play is very loyal to EQ and just wants it to be the best game
out there.
