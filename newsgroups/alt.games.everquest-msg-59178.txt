Hit points = Mana. Liched-up necromancers can easily start a fight at
40-50% of the health and they're just as fragile as other robes once
their ****skin drops.

When the cleric is not symboling the entire group, the rule of thumb
seems to be that the priority is: Tank and pullers, cleric, necro,
rogue and non-pulling monk, then everyone else.
