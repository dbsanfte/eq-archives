Like this poor wizzy I was grouped with last night in DL.
We over pulled and the mobs wiped the both of us clean.
Had a cleric friend in zone who I asked for a 49 res. NP he says. Told my
group mate that we have a free 49 res incoming. What does he do?

Completely loots his corpse.

They heard the howls of anguish in Halas I was told.
