See that neat looking troll on the intro screen -- the one with both 
hands raised high, bludgeoning a frogluk?  He has both his hands on his 
weapon and looks very cool as he is using BOTH HANDS to bring his weapon 
down with great force.  This pictures could not of been taken in-game 
because all troll two-handed weapon animations are currently BROKEN.  
When a troll fights with a 2HS or 2HB weapon it looks just they were 
holding a 1HS or 1HB weapon.  Now, do the EQ developers ever plan on 
fixing the two-handed animations so they look different than the one-
handed animations?
