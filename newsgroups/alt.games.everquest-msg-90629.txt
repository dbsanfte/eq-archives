Yeah, dont count on that. My corpse that conned 167 hours left to res one
day, and 137 the next, changed to unressable in about 2 hours of online
time. And the guide was a dink, and didnt see the 'xp loss due to a bug'
thing. Even though he said "If your corpse said you have 2732 hours left to
res it, its a bug, its always been 3 hours." Dang worthless guides. :P
