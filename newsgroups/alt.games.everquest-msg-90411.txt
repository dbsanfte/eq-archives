Yeah, if you define balance as "we need six clerics, if not more, and,
oh, a couple of druids would help too...'   The "problem" is that for
every cleric there are probably two or three druids.   Once the
encounters start requiring cleric healing druids are a minority
class on raids.   That's not a friendly situation for a class that
outnumbers all others...
