Oh yeah I almost forgot about this but....
Grab all your plat and head to the Tundra outside of Black Burrow, Once on
the tundra keep going and following the wall on your left.  Eventually you
will find the Entrance to Perma and the home of the Ice Giants.  Ask if
anyone needs a banker.  Most of the time this place is camped with people
who for whatever reason can'y make it to the nearest merchant.
Trade them all your plat for an equivalnt amount of gold, silver, copper and
FS weapons ( I usually buy FS for 3-4pp each) and run your butt off to the
nearest merchant and sell, then head to bank and swap for plat.
My shammy has turned the 10pp he started with from killing and selling into
well over 1Kpp in just a matter of 30-40minutes a day for 2 weeks.
This technique is formally called being a banker and tends to yield a return
of 10%-150% per trip.
The trick is to not be fickle and argue over the price of FS if they want
5pp per weapon that's ok too, just take it to the nearest town that you /con
Amiable in and sell for 6pp but always take a cut of 10% at least.
Example

Head out to IG's with 60pp
Camper 1 hands you
500 gold
1500 silver
3000 copper
Which = 58pp
You hand him 60pp and usually camper 1 will hand you something along the
lines of....
2 FS Scimitars          = 10pp
3 FS Great Staffs     = 15pp
3 FS Long Swords  = 15pp
1 FS 2HD Sword   = 5pp
(These are merchant prices I have gotten)
= 45pp
58pp + 45pp = 98pp and of course you'll need to pay him for each FS weapon
my usualy price is 2-3p but even at 4pp each you still make ALOT of money
and usually if you ask them first they don't mind if you keep a weapon or 2
back for yourself.

90pp for 60pp? I'll take that any day of the week (and i usually do :-)
Either way it Yields enough everytime to buy each of my characters a decent
weapon.
