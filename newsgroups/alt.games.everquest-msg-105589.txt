Besides a top-poster, Rios seems to be one of the bitter druids one
encounters so often. Maybe you should try a little research on your
character before you roll him out.
For instance, I knew before-hand that my warrior would have a practically
non-existant solo career, but would be in demand for groups / raids at
higher levels. My wife played a druid till 54, and got frustrated with the
difficulty finding groups. But instead of poisoning newsgroups and message
boards with her bitterness, she created a cleric (which she was able to
outfit very well with the pp she made from soloing <which druids do very
well> and porting<ditto>) and levelled her up to raiding level. Now when she
wants to group / raid, she pulls out the cleric, and if she feels like
soloing, "To the druid cave Robin".

So in short, Qwitcherbitchen, nobody wants to hear it.
