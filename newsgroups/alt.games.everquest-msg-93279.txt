It really depends on your play style, if you solo mostly, you'll probably
never get hit, so AC isn't that important, however, for me, I hunt a lot in
dungeons or close quarters where no matter what I do I *WILL* get beat on,
so AC is very useful.

Harmony is really not necessary, and it kinda surprises me that someone
would camp him twice, but great for you;  just wait for the red smuggler (if
you ever do the camp you'll know what I mean) to wander off then nuke Dyllin
silly (only has about 250hp)

I'm not a twink, the only items I've been given were a Nathsar bracer at
level 40 (the same person gave a Sash of the Dragonborn to a friend of mine,
talk about w00t) and the 2ac/35hp/25mana earring that replaced a forest loop
when the warrior got happyhappy and tossed stuff around after getting the
sash.

http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39316

I looted the Elder Wolf Hide, the GM event earring (no drop), the GM event
belt(no drop), and the Kromrif leggings (no drop but I had a 54 druid friend
help me with this), the rest I've bought on the market.

And as for fashion only for rich twinks, I wore Tizmak leggings from level 6
when somebody sold them to me for 10pp all the way to level 34 when I got
the Kromrifs, because (this was back before Luclin) I think that the old
leather texture on wood elf female pants makes them look like cheap whores,
likewise I cut myself out of the loop on a few old world leather tunics so
that I could keep the velious leather texture on that too (normal tizmak at
6, cured tizmak about 30 minutes later =P, then an Ulthork tunic at 22 or
so, which I wore until I got my Shroud of Nature about level 39 or so (yes,
it has the old leather look, however I didn't get it until after Luclin, so
that is kind of a moot point))

Oh, and I only paid 2k for my Sarnak shield.

The way that I've gotten all of my stuff has mostly been to play the market.
Buy something from idiots who sell way low, and sell to idiots who pay way
high.  One of my RL friends just bought a pony because he couldn't figure
out what to spend 15k on from the same tactics (although he has a much
higher idiot tolerance level than me, and so has more money, I only do EC
when I need an upgrade).   Of course I see a Jade Reaver in EC the next day
for 15k (about half the price of them normally) and he only has 6k left.
AGGH, it's one of the last 8 parts I need for my epic (or one of 2 parts for
Elaborate Scimmy).

And now for something completely self serving and greedy...

Cheap push for the  "Get me a leafblower" foundation on Tarew Marr.
Still need:
CoM Reavers
Venril Sathir / Venril Sathir Remains
Ulump Puljuk
Faydedar
Corrupted Gorilla (Emerald Jungle)
Corrupted Seafury (Ocean of Tears)
Corrupted Brownie (Lesser Faydark)
Corrupted Seahorse (the guy in Kedge)
