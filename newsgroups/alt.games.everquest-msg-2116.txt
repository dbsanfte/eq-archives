This is great advice, though you might have trouble getting a HG group
before level 30. Sashes (for the Qeynos quest), give experience, good
faction, 5 gp - 1 pp, and a bronze weapon or shield worth another
couple pp. You are high enough that only the brigands will aggro you,
they are always warriors and are only level 14-16. Check a map, there
are six or seven camps in Western Karana alone, with more in EK, NK,
Lake Rathe and Rathe Mountains.

Unless you have a bunch of high level friends, forget about the
Crafted BP and Paldruns for a while. The werewolf talon is in a nasty
place inside Mistmoore (I think they are all nasty places in there),
while the three rune of Dwarves require repeated evil eye killing in
Runnyeye.  Even the optic nerves from Evil eyes will require you
getting a caster to help, but they aren't too bad, I got one of mine
off a level 26 mage soloing them. The aviak charm, and Trazdon's
circlet are relatively easy to get, the rest are hard to kill but
pretty easy to loot, since they are not much use to anyone else.
