Hi,

I bought EQ a couple of days ago but am having trouble subscribing.  
Initially I kept getting messages saying my payment hadn't gone through but 
there is a subscription showing when I check my account online. Are you 
supposed to receive an e-mail notification or something?  Whatever the case 
I can't log into the game.

Any help would be much appreciated!

Cheers,

Ian
