Tailoring at the basic level is mildly profitable since half (or more) of
the components are looted from critters.  For a long time, I bought stacks
of cap patterns and turned all those Ruined pelts I kept finding into gear
that would net me a little cash.  Spidersilk works even better once you get
your skill to the point where you can weave swatches into armor.  I never
bothered to figure out just how much money I was making with these methods
but it wasn't much.

Fishing also yields small but consistent profits.  I make about 4gp per
stack of bait.  However, fishing requires you basically to stand and do
nothing, so I only do it when I'm resting, chatting heavily, or very bored.

My friend has mastered Baking and he tells me you can make money that way.
I think this is mostly because, like with Tailoring, you find a sizeable
portion of the ingredients, rather than buying them.  My friend makes lots
of fishrolls, which are Fresh Fish + Bat Wing.  I don't know what they sell
for, but bat wings are essentially free, and he'd profit from the fish even
without cooking them.

I know that Fletching and Smithing are money pits.  I've dropped 25 plat or
so into Fletching to get a skill of 80, and roughly 15 into Smithing to get
a skill of about 35....And I'm only just getting started.  It was 35 plat to
get through the really easy stuff, and all I have to show for my efforts are
a wimpy custom bow and a studded tunic.  I'm told that once you get Smithing
up to 130 or so, you can make armor that people will actually buy, but the
expenditure necessary to reach that level scares me.
