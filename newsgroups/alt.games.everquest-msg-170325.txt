>. Any advice?

Shadowknight and Cleric ...

SK make great tanks, high AC due to being a plate class, Plus spells to hold
extra taunt (important if hes the only thing stopping the Cleric from
becoming a nasty stain on the floor) and can FD pull as well.
They have snare DoTs, Extra dmg output from a pet (Ok its a bit of a joke,
but it helps) and can also go invis vs undead or living in case of corpse
recovery (But not both)

Cleric is able to boost the SK HP and AC as well as stun, root and DD (and
DoT if its undead), also can rez and invis Vs undead.

My Cleric always prefers to duo with a hybrid over a warrior, well except
for rangers ... Unless I'm trying to max my alteration.
