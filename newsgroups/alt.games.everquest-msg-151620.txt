I think this what you are saying, but I'll take a stab at it. I always
thought is was more of random table thing....so in RM when farming Giants,
it's good to kill all the other things too so that there will be a chance of
"more" giants spawning.

For example:

Say there are 100 mobs in RM at any given time where 30 are regular Giants
and 70 are either Skelies and Cyclopses.  By killing off all 30 giants, then
there is chance for each new re-spawn of it being either a Giant, a Skelie,
or a Cyclops. If the odds of a giant are 30% and then of the 30 "re-spawns"
approximately only 9-10 would be Giants. This would lead to an "extinction"
of giants in this case.

By killing all the mobs in the zone, you are helping provide more of chance
for Giants to spawn in the general population.
