I guess im still a newb at level 12 but I ventured into this zone on the
reccomendation of a friend and guild mate who said it was fantastic experience.
And it is. I'd always stayed away becuse it seems to be populated with 40+
players but i just kind of lurk near the entrance sticking to Drakes and rock
dervishes and the odd bassilisk. It's great because most of the mobs are
indifferent and so they dont aggro for no reason (with the exception of sprites
but they're rare at the zone entrance) and i was the only person in the entire
zone hunting them so i had my pick of the bunch. Also the loot is good (for my
level anyway) even bagged a couple of gems, the rock dervs drop blocks of ore.
I'd just never heard this zone reccomended to newbies but i think its very good
as long as you stay near the zone and dont bother with shadow step ;)
Im curious as to why all the high level players are there though? when i get
brave enough ill have to venture further in to find out.
