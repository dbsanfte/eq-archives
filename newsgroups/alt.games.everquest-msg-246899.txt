Granted they will be surprised but they overcome that quickly if they
are able und willing to learn. On the other hand if your cleric only
knows of the single pull - virtually add free - outdoor environment it
takes far more skill to handle massive pulls. Having to deal with more
than one mob where you see skill in a group. This not only affects
clerics. An enchanter who never has been in a dungeon isn't prepared
to handle such situations. I've met an 55 or so enchanter on PoI who
asks me what the color stun spell is doing. For all you that never have
played an enchanter these spells are point blank AE stuns. He never saw
a use for them. *boggle*
I would bet that there isn't a single enchanter out there who has grown
up in dungeons who doesn't know these spells. They are essential imho.
But to get to the point. Though you are right regarding hard hitting
mobs I really prefer a cleric,enchanter whatever who has used the
dungeon route to level up. Even if it were only LDoNs.

But it will only happen once. Knowing when to waste mana in order to
keep tank and/or enchanter alive and how to deal with adds is far more
difficult to learn.

I totally agree with you there. :)
