As you level up and no longer need the items you are given (no drop)

what do you do with them? Managing your inventory and keeping these items
around is a hassle, I'm not sure if I'll need them again. The Gem Encrusted
Mail Kit that you're given for the armor quest, will you need it after you'
re done with the entire quest?



I'm not sure what's going on with the journal but when I try to click on the
menu bar nothing happens. Do you need to buy a journal?



Any help is appreciated
