I'm not being intentionally obtuse.  There's a resource, which would be 
perfect for communicating the simple facts of the matter.  Here's our 
next update, when it will start, when we guess it will stop.  Hey, we've 
been working on it for a while and it looks like it will indeed be 
finished on time/go over time maybe an hour longer than we thought/be 
done early.

Here's what we are trying to change.

Its right there, in black and white, they update it so its not a dead page.

BUT its almost never accurate.  Three minutes of someone's day.

I spend more time than that complaining about it here on AGE :)

Post a link to this forum you claim has the accurate poop, and I'll 
bookmark it and try looking there.

BUT if the EQplayer page doesn't match that, I'm still gonna complain.

If you can't keep the page up to date, then just take it down, there's 
no point at all in the page as it is.  If minimal attention were paid to 
keeping it up to date it would be superior to wandering around on some 
web forum.  Right now its just misleading and irritating.
