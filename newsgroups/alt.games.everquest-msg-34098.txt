>Level 35 Rogue looking for a guild of people that like to group!

Our guild is pretty friendly, and aimed towards the more mature player
(no d00ds, for example!). We only invite people we know, however, so
the best thing you can do is group with some of us. Some guild members
around your level have been playing in paw a lot recently (as well as
a couple of Healers United, our sister guild), so if you're in the
area, drop in and look out for us.
