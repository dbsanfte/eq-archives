All classes should use Sense Heading in a hotkey. Im amazed every time i
meed a 30+ char who after a port to NK need me to tell him which way he have
to go to reack WKor SK.
It will be maxed out fast. My warrior use the following hotkey:
/doability 7 (kick)
/attack off
/doability 5 (got my begging at that one)
/attack on
/doability 1 (sense heading)

I both kick, train my begging skill, and my sense heading skill.
