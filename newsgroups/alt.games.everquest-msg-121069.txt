They can -- and frequently do -- fix zones while the rest of the
server is operational.   That gets rid of the "some NPCs are
spawning in bad spots" reason.

The firepot issue was bad, I'm sure, especially for any melee
characters who bound there.   And zoning from IC to EW is
another bad issue.   Logically, those could be fixed by taking
the zones down, but who knows whether that's possible.  I'd
still hazard a guess that neither problem was "emergency
patch" material;  there's simply not enough of the player base
using either the firepots or zoning from IC to EW to justify it.

That leaves either the texture cache issue or the petition queue
issue.   The petition queue issue, on the face of it ("the delays
some of you may have had..." not "some of you not getting your
petitions 'lost'") doesn't seem like an emergency patch issue,
either.

Telling your customer base, on the other hand, to go into 'your'
software directory and delete files?   Yeah, that's an emergency
fix.   (Personally, I'm a bit surprised they couldn't/didn't download
a patcher that would auto-delete the *.txc files.)
