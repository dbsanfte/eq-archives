I know a lot of us are planning on trying out the Progression servers, 
if we want to be able to group and possibly even guild up, we ought to 
pick on.

 From previous comments by some posters, it looks like Combine is the 
pick, can we make that official?

I know there's something to be said for Sleeper, its likely to be a bit 
less crowded, which especially at first will be a benefit.  But its odd 
to think that way, after experiencing all the massive Undercrowding in 
the low end of the game recently; its been an achievement to get 
sufficient people in a group for leadership exp to kick in!

But it seems like a late date to try and push for the dark horse... the 
sleeper, if you will.

STILL undecided as to race and class!

ps what is the method for joining the AGE serverwide channel again? 
I've forgotten,and not been on it with my recent forays into newbie 
experimentation.  Its likely to be the unofficial guild channel for the 
first few days of Progression though, till we get a real guild set up.
