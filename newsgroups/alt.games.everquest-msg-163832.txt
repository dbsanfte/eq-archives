Well, I guess usefulness depends a bit on your playstyle but sure, I 
find the contribution to group damage I do has shifted more towards 
nukes/pet than before when I was more likely to use the summoned hammer.

leave a corpse somewhere for some reason. Handy when I got the urge to 
go fishing too :) ..

you have noticed at one time or another too :) ..
