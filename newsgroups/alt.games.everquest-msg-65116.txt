Yup, that's for sure... And like others have said, go to Ebay and get it for
chicken feed even...

But above and beyond all that, and forgive me if I"m repeating someone
else's answer, I don't have the whole thread...

To the original poster, perhaps maybe just once you should actually read the
terms of usage that you agree too each and every time you play the game.  It
basically says that Verant can bend you over and give it to you hard and you
will like it and beg for more, or you won't play.

What you have seen in this ng the last couple of days is a lot of
frustration and grousing, but all of us here with any brains understand that
technology is an ever changing thing.  You keep up, or you choke on fumes.

A lawsuit because your Win 95 is outdated is the most ludicrious thing I've
heard to date.  Win 98 has been out for HOW long now?  Let's see, at least
since um...  1998 eh?  I believe I still have a copy of DOS for Dummies
around here somewhere...  I'd be happy to send it to you if you'd like.

Not trying to be snide, but I can't help myself.  If you are on a machine
that still has 95, you won't be able to play the game anyway even if you
install 98 since your RAM and everything else will be woefully lacking.
Just get a new machine.  They are almost as cheap as dirt.  Go to Gateway if
nothing else and finance one.  We are looking at financing TWO of them for
under $3200 total.  That is with Pentium 4 (1.8), 40 Gig HD, 512 RAM
(Upgradable to 2 Gig Ram), 64 Meg GeForce 2 card and much more on each
machine.

We are probably simply going to give our old machine away even though it is
less than 2 years old...  It just isn't worth anything anymore.  That's the
way it is.  It has a Pentium 3, 128 RAM, 20 Gig HD, 32 Meg Nvidia card,
etc...  It's resale value is nothing unless you are very poor and desperate
for a puter like a friend of ours is.  She will like her very used, very
loved Xmas gift.

So, to the original poster, you go ahead and get laughed out of court.  Then
go buy a real computer..
