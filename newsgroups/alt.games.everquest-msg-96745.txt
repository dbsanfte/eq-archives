You would most likely not be able to create that name during
the daytime (while GMs are approving names or maybe even at
night if they've put it in the badname database). If you
were able to create it, someone would probably /petition it
quickly.

If and when a GM finally found you, it would be changed to
something banal, yet dorky. Worst case scenario, you would
get an account warning (3 strikes you're out kinda thing).
