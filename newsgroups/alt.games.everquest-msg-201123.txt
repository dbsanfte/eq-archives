A druid can easily be primary healer in the 40s and early 50s for xp camps
without KEI and without significant downtime. :)  After all, there's about 3
years experience doing just that when KEI didn't exist (and even when it did
it was rare) and C2 was few & far between (not much point in begging C2 off
of some poor schlub in some other zone when it only lasts 30 minutes or so).

It's a real shame that so many people take that shortcut and don't bother to
learn their classes enough to be a  GREAT <insert class here>.  Mediocre
appears to be the order of the day.  It's a shame that the newer players
haven't gotten the attitude that "downtime isn't evil by definition."  It's
"OMFG I don't have KEI...I MUST SIT HERE FOR A FREAKIN' 5 MINUTES TO MED UP
ENOUGH."  (talking about xp camps here...same is true for raids but the
degree is much different and unless you have a great raid leader downtime is
usually significant)
