This EXACTLY describes High levels farming stuff.  They need to
implement TRIVAL LOOT CODE everywhere to prevent what you just
described.  Unless they do, then the PROBLEM STILL EXISTS so nerfing
KEI did not solve your problem at all.

And I've had far more cases of high levels farming stuff and acting
EXACTLY as you describe than a low level moron with KEI.
