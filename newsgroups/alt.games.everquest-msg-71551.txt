That's what I expected as well.  I ported over to Butcher just to see if I
could find the one in Kaladim.  Ran over to the POD ... no Soulbinder.  I
did finally find him, but he's waaaay out of the way.  I had to go to track
to find him.

You'll definitely have to be non-KOS to use his services, though.  He's over
by the bard that gives the 'Mail Run' quest.
