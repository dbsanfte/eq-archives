Difference of opinion about those first 24 levels. I don't think you should
design a less then optimum character for 24 levels because you can get some
benefits later. I feel better designing a character I know will make it
those first 24 levels and worrying about what happens after that later. I
don't think a shaman is a particularily good melee fighter either. Took my
ogre<non twinked> out for a spin recently and pretty much got thumped hard
in melee by blues.

It's an academic question since power leveling and twinking rule the game. I
mean the question for most people is really "Should I give my level 1 shaman
5,000 pp in wisdom gear or AC stuff?" With the level of twinking that goes
on, a couple of points wisdom or stamina or strength one way or another gets
smothered in gear. It does matter for first chr created, but then getting to
20+ for your first character should be a major priority.

My memory isn't that great, but remember someone that had a character and
posted under the name Jubjum or Juwjub or something like? They started a
character and did not allocate a single point into stats. Petitioned GMs to
get them and it was no dice. I think they were one of the first newsgroup
posters to get their character to ~50.

That pretty much sums it up for me. Just about anything you do wrong in
character creation can be fixed by gear. Heck, when I decided to try FV I
went human druid even though I knew I was giving away 5 wisdom to a halfling
and wouldn't be twinked. I don't have super gear either, just use sound
tactics.
