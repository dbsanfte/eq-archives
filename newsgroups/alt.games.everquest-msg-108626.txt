Generally, yes, I think they should be able to taunt at least a little
bit. Did I say 'outtaunt a casting hybrid'?

They are more effective for a lot of things. My guild has a ton of
pallies and SK that make great MAs in many situations, and I count a
warrior, a shadow knight and a paladin among my alts :)

No. Evil bad idea and way out of line.

I'd be utterly thrilled if we could just lose the 10% penalty. Losing
that would let me heal 428 pts in 3 seconds for 175 mana at 55 and 978
pts in 5.5 seconds for 400 mana at 60, instead of 385 and 880. And if
that 978 were changed to something above 1000, I'd feel like a god.

(Okay, I want single target PotG, too :) )
