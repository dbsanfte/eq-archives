So do something else while you wait, and listen to ooc/shout chatter
to see if anyone is forming up to kill Grimgash, and if noone is,
shout/ooc yourself once in a while.  My experience has been that
people form up to kill him every five or ten minutes (on Runnyeye and
Antonia Bayle).  If this is too much for you, Everquest 2 isn't the
game for you.
