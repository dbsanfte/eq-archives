What about the druids you may say?  Who cares you might say?  ... if
so why are you reading this??

There's been a whole lot of talk about melee balance recently mostly
from disgrunted wariorrs but have a look at the state that druids are
in a sec:

1) Ports devalued with PoP and now LDoN
2) Many spells indoor only so useles in LDoN
3) Soloing devalued with the new bonuses for grouping
4) Not valued as main healers by parties in most cases

How many times do you see a group saying "looking for Druid" or
"please for the love of God we need a druid here now"?  I have a druid
that was my main (a long while ago) that is virtually moth-balled
whilst I play just about any other class. So come on people, support
your local druid!

It might not help that I have reached a rather poor spell level (39)
and have another five slow levels till the next (hopefuly) bettr one.

Just my 2c.  Feel free to add your own ;-)

Cheers.
