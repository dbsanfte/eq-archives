Ghoulbane procs at L20 (iirc the damage/proc at that level is around
140 or so, could check it on Lucy if it matterred a lot).  Stats are:
15dmg 34dly, wt. 9.5, Effect: Dismiss Undead (Combat)
Compare that to, oh say a Centi SS:
12dmg 25dly, wt. 4.5(?), STR+5 STA+5
and don't forget to remove the proc before comparing.

I'll check the ENC kit when I get home, all I remember is that the
rings were +2 int, which is pathetic.  What I remember of the PAL
kit, using the name of the "real" item where it was obvious:

Head:  Skull-shaped Barbute [13ac 35hp 10mr] (good choice, imo)
Neck:  Orc Fang [5ac 3str 3sta 3agi] (at least it isn't stupid)
Ears:  Orc Fang [3ac 3str 15hp] (decent for cheap stuff)
Face:  Splitpaw Hide [3ac 5svP 5svM] (weak, esp. w/ light removed)
Shoulder:  (from Unrest) [?ac 3str ?svM] (grrr, forget name)
Chest: Netherbian Chitin [20ac 2str 5svF] (generic)
Arms:  Barbed [7ac 2dex?agi? forget which] (weak)
Back:  Banded [7ac] (weak)
Hands: Darkmail [10ac 5dex 50mana] (cheap, effective)
Fingers: Jagged Band [5ac 3str] (could be worse)
Wrists: Serpentine [1ac 9agi 3dex, Ext. Aff. 2] (gawdawful stupid)
Legs:  [10ac] (legs get expensive fast, so i guess could be worse)
Feet:  Crustacean [forget stats] (ok)
Weapon: gimped Ghoulbane clone [15dmg 34dly] (weak)
Shield: Cracked Darkwood [12ac 9str] (weak, especially w/ light removed)
Ranged: [8dmg 51dly 100rng] (gawdawful stupid, Paladin != Archer)

If I were to actually try to play this character, without doing any
twinking to fix him (I have several characters already on Test), the
first thing to do would be the PoK book quest for a light source.
Second would be to kill some wisps so he could buy adequate bracers,
a BABS (24/39 2hs that's a light source), and the spell Center.  Then
group when possible, otherwise kill wisps for pp, and replace as much
af that crap gear as fast as possible.  The SSB, Orc Fang Earrings,
Neth. Chitin, Crusty Boots, and even the DM Gaunts are adequate, the
rest ranges from crap (the Serp Bracers and the bow) to weak (Jagged
Bands) for a high 20s Paladin.  Hell, it'd probably be worthwhile to
do the Ghoulbane quest and get the real thing, with the proc it's
reasonable for fighting Undead and iirc it is a light source.
