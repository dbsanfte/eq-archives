Don't bother with Int/Wis gear as you can obtain comparable or better Str gear
much more easily, run around PoK or Nexus asking for a Focus, boom 255 Str 
reasonably easy (don't be obnoxious about it.)  Save up for a geerlok, should
only be around 200-250p at most.  Also, get some Chr gear, maybe 120 if you
can manage it, will save you money on the store bought items.

Currently, smithing will generate you very little in the way of profit, it is
only when you get to Mistletoe cutting sickles that you will find any sort of
profit (a few other sundry items might sell, but I wouldn't bank on it.)

Don't believe what people say, you can raise your smithing to 250 with VERY
LITTLE COSTS.  That said, it will require more patience than 95% of the population
of Everquest has.  If you do not have such patience, don't bother reading any 
further. 

The Cheap Man's Guide to Smithing.

The Basics:
      
         Item            Trivial

      Metal Bits           18
      Training Points      21
      Studs                35 (Save those metal bits, give them to a tailor friend)
      Boning               37 (Give them to a tailor friend)
      Scalers              41
      Sewing Kit           52
      Lanterns             68
      Dairy Spoons         74 (Give one to a baker)
      Filleting Knives     76 (Give one to your tailor friend)
      Banded Gorgets       92 (Skip this if it's too expensive)

The Mid Level:

      Condensed Shadow
         Arrowheads        116 (Go to Shadeweaver's Thicket and kill the Shak Dratha)
      Embroidering Needle  122

The Hard Part:

      DeathSteel dagger    131 (go to the Temple of Droga, and kill, kill, kill)
 
If you aren't sick of Droga by now:

      Deathsteel Halberd   162 
   
Expensive part:

    Fine Steel Plate       188 (yes it will cost you 3-6+kpp depending on your luck)

The insanely hard part:

    Humming Orbs           168 (save every one you make, you'll need a mule)
    Fine Steel Plate       188 
    Shadowscream Armor     250 (remember those humming orbs?)

Notes.

To do Deathsteel, you'll need a fairly high level of brewing, or a dedicated brewer friend.

Killing Shak Dratha in Shadeweaver's Thicket can be a pain, but sometimes they'll pop up in
the caves adjacent to Paludal Caverns, where you can kill them en masse.

Humming Orbs and Shadowscream armor requires you to complete a few quests in Shar Vahl, they
begin with Master Barkhelm (in the smithy,sp?) They also require you to hunt in the
buggy Hollowshade Moor.  When the Wolves or Owlbears are up (only on the Southern Islands)
spend all your EQ time hunting these over and over, till you begin to bleed out of your ears,
and then keep hunting them.  You'll also have to hunt swirling shadows, which can be 
comparatively easier, but some say just as bad (they are NORENT, so you'll have to farm these
before you start your Shadowscream.)

If you can find a Master Smith, perhaps you can convince him to purchase Mistletoe Cutting 
Sickle PARTS, which trivial around 180, still expensive on failures though.

If you use this method, I estimate it will cost around 20kpp (maybe less) to get to (250)Smithing, 
oh and a better part of your sanity.
