Gonna hit your points (all valid) in order to show that it actually is
possible to have a totally fair point system.  :)

The only way officers manipulate how points are doled out in my guild is by
applying a "zerg modifier" (.5) to a raid that we either just utterly
overpowered and could have done with half the people, or to a mob that we
just barely win and finish out with a zerg, and it affects everybody at the
raid, including the officers.

We have an item database, and a simple system for assigning a value to items
that can't be manipulated.  Items are either 2, 4, 7 or 10 RP (cause we
don't actually kill all that many dragons anymore, it's "RaidPoint" :). 
That's base value, we use a bidding system to handle multiple people
interested (had an item go for 55 the other night...  MM really needs to
drop that belt more often).

No favor perks.  Any perks offered are specific-task oriented (bonus for
getting Emp key for instance) and officers aren't eligible.  There are
penalties, but not detraction penalties.  In other words, you never "lose"
RP that you already have, but you might gain at .90 for a particular raid if
you show up late for instance.

We have set raid nights.  Kinda bizarre among elemental-level guilds from
what I hear.  On off-nights, only certain targets of opportunity are
eligible to be run as an RP-raid, and the values are all the same (anyone
can run a raid on an off-night and use whatever loot system they want on
other targets).

Apps get 1/2.  The day you become a member, you are a member.  :)

Bidding system handles this nicely.

The joy of a truly fair points system is that the guy that only shows up
ever other Tuesday and Friday will still eventually be able to get equipped,
and generally cheaper than the "first-timers" (see reference to the 55 point
belt above that had never dropped for us before  :).

That's a pretty bizarre concept.  I have heard of guilds that do something
like that, though.  It just seems so likely to breed discontent.

The trick is to have a system that handles evolution gracefully.  With a
template for item base values that never changes, any new items are easily
added to the database.  With a template for raid values that never changes,
any new raid is easily added to the database.

Or, to put it another way, my guild's points system worked just fine on
Vindi, and worked just fine on RZtW, and never changed at all.  :)

There are going to be people that think *any* system is unfair.  At least
that's what I assume, as the only complaints *ever* about my guild's point
system is "how late is too late" and "c'mon, I know we rezzed the MT five
times, but that's not *really* a zerg is it?"  :)
