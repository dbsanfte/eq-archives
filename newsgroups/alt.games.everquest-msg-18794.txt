I was in Firona Vie.  I had just changed my password that night.  I was
looking through my bank account, re-organizing some things.  Everything
was all good.

We went to Lava Mountains, where I bound myself, before entering sol in
order to help a guild mate camp Ragefire.  After the camp was over, I
had a friend port me to Dread Lands.

I wasn't on for a couple of weeks.  Real life has a way of interfering
with EQ at the most inconvenient of times.

The next time I logged on I was fully dressed... but I was back in Lava.
How strange.  No one had my password.  I had changed it the last time I
was on.  Must be some strange glitch in the game, right?

So I run over to Freeport.  I sell the stuff that I had on me in my
inventory.

Go to the bank.

Guess what.  One back pack, all my money, and all of my nice droppable
gear is gone.  Diamond ring, Paw of Opolla, cenobite belt, sebilite coat
(which didn't even belong to me), everything that was of any value at
all, and was in my bank account is now just... gone.

Now... I know... for a fact... that not one other single person in the
world has my password.

Someone has managed, by some means or another to hack my account.

So I /petition.  I explain what has happened.

Evin responds back to me, and says that he will not do anything until I
go to EverQuest.com, click on Producer's Letter on the left, and then
click on Account Security.  Tells me to read that page carefully, and
then come back and talk to him.

So I read the page carefully.  And I am astounded.  I come back and talk
to Evin, and ask him to clarify, because it seems to me that basically
number 2 on the page states that if you complain about theft of items,
#1) those items will not be returned to you, and #2) your account will
be banned.

"(2)Any and all stolen and/or compromised accounts that are reported to
SOE will be banned, and no items will be reimbursed. Any player found to
be involved in an account theft will have any and all of his/her
accounts banned."

So let me get this straight.  Due to your game's poor security, if
someone breaks into my account and takes things, your answer is to
punish *me* by banning me.  And the banning is NOT temporary.  It's
permanent.

Evin was very courteous, and explained that he would not ban me unless I
asked him to.  And he was very nice about the whole thing.  But... my
God.  To ban someone because your security is well... unsecure???

So basically, I just have to let whoever has hacked my account have at
it, or else have myself permanently banned.  At this point... what's the
waste of money for?

I love EverQuest.  I've been its biggest fan for over 2 years.  I've put
time and effort into making my character, and getting her to the level
she is (which is kind of hard when you're a weekend player, and working
on about 5 other characters too.)  Do I want to have myself permanently
banned?  Hell no!

Am I the only one who wants to cry at the injustice of it all?
