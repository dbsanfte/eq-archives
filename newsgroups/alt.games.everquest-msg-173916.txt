I completely understand what you're saying, Jazz, and admit that it's
hard to fault this system in a guild that is built around raid
production. It makes perfect sense for them and cannot be faulted.

I think the problem arises when people who, for whatever reason,
cannot offer the necessary level of raid participation for such a
guild decide to *join* such a guild. You really should know goin in
that that particular guild requires that kind of commitment. For
everyone who *can* make that kind of commitment, the system works
extremely well.

In a guild that is largely social and developmentally-geared and
occasionally high end raiding, I believe that there should be a system
more conducive to awarding whomever is on the current raid. NBG would
still apply where appropriate, but attendance would not.

On a side note I need a little clarification on some of the related
terminology I've seen in this thread, please.

NBG = need before greed
RNG = random number generator
DKP = ???
