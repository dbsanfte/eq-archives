Yeah - Mechanical was being anal about it as KS happens all the time. Report
it, then forget it, but I do not understand you attempting to justify the
KS.

KS is KS, not matter what you colour you try to paint it,  no-one has any
right to a mob someone else has engaged. If you are voluntarily on a raid or
in a group on a "need before greed" understanding, fine, that does not
extend to other players in the zone.

A 50+ player has a major amount of power in this game over lower level
characters, quite a few abuse that power. There are no mitigating
circumstances - they are no more important or moreseserving, some are just
assholes.

As for Epics - sure they are a PITA, but everyone who decides to embark on
their epic/s knows this, that is their choice and the rewards are suitabley
large. That is exactly what they sign up for, and it is not everyone else's
responsibility or burden just because the epic seeker just happens to be in
the same zone.
