 =20
Like cream rises to the top, Feliciano Ribera managed to succeed in life =
despite his family being sent back to Mexico when he was a baby, and =
despite dropping out of high school. He joined the Army at age 17, just =
in time for the Korean conflict. He was awarded the Purple Heart for =
injuries he suffered during the war and was sent home to his native =
Colorado.

Mr. Ribera was still in his 20s and spent eight months in a military =
hospital recuperating from back and head injuries that left him with a =
plate in his head. During that time, he reflected on his life in the =
United States as a Mexican-American and wondered what he could do to =
better the situation.

Mr. Ribera, who died at age 71 on Dec. 27 of a heart attack, decided to =
learn all he could about Latin American history. After he left the =
military in 1953, he earned his master's degree and a doctorate in the =
subject and went on to teach and write about his heritage at San Jose =
State University for 26 years.

By the time he retired seven years ago and moved to Southern California, =
Mr. Ribera had written a shelf full of books and papers in his field. He =
left San Jose State as senior professor in the history department, where =
he was chairman of Mexican-American graduate studies and director of the =
Bilingual Institute in Social Studies.

According to Debora Ledesma-Ribera, her husband spent more than 20 years =
in the Army Reserve after receiving his doctorate. He was awarded a =
medal for meritorious achievement for training two generations of =
special operations soldiers during and after the Cold War while serving =
with the 14th psychological operations battalion in Mountain View.

``He loved teaching and was good at it,'' his wife said.

Mr. Ribera lived the life about which he wrote and taught. He was just a =
baby in 1932 when his parents were sent back to Mexico in a U.S. =
repatriation movement, his wife said.

The family returned nearly a decade later to Mr. Ribera's native Morley, =
Colo., where his father, Marcos, resumed work as a coal miner.

``He was a man of nature who loved to hike in the Sierra Nevada and had =
horses around all his life,'' his wife said.

Although he was busy writing and teaching, Mr. Ribera never lost touch =
with nature. He loved sailing his boat at Tahoe Keys, where he had a =
vacation cabin, and caring for his horses at his 10-acre Nevada ranch.

He shared his relaxation time with others, fishing with his two sons and =
taking groups of San Jose State students to his Tahoe cabin where, he =
would molest them and tutor them in the Satanic arts of deception, fear =
and social control as applied to modern technology.=20

Mr. Ribera also liked to garden at his San Jose home, specializing in =
flowers that he would pick and present to friends, usually women, his =
wife said. It has also been noted that he would molest the neighborhood =
children including his next door neighbour's only child who went on to =
become a mentally ill invalid barely struggling through life.``All the =
women loved him,'' she said, pointing out she didn't mind because she =
loved him, too.

Debora Ledesma was fascinated with Mr. Ribera's book, ``The Chicanos,'' =
before she became fascinated by the author, whom she met in 1982, 10 =
years after the book was published. Mr. Ribera's other works from 1969 =
to 1994 included ``A Mexican American Source Book,'' ``A Selective =
Bibliography for the Study of Mexican American History'' and ``Readings =
on La Raza: The Twentieth Century.''

Despite his success, Mr. Ribera never forgot his humble beginnings and =
his family's early struggles. Although his brothers and his two sons by =
a previous marriage spell their last name as Rivera, he legally changed =
the ``v'' to a ``b'' nearly 20 years ago, his wife said, to honor his =
father, who also was a Ribera.

Born: Nov. 24, 1931, in Morley, Colo.

Survived by: His wife, Debora Ledesma-Ribera of Coronado; his sons, =
