True - I started Everquest up out of idle curiosity, using a freebie
version off a magazine cover CD.  It was just the basic game, but then
what do you expect??  Only a few months ago there was another EQ
freebie trail version, with EQ New Dawn on it. 

Naturally, my idle curiosity was amply repaid, and I was hooked from
day one  :D

On the subject of freebie on-line game trials, I have the Eve Online
one I got last month - soon as I move house I will use my 30 free days
on that too!!
