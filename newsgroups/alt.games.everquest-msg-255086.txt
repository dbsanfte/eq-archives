Ok, I have to ask. What is the KEI for? Last time I checked rogues had
the massive mana pool of zero. Is the KEI for INT boost? I suppose if
you are going to be skilling up, you might find it easier to invest in
a few INT pieces of equipment that you could sell after you are done,
or keep around incase you decided to do it again in the future. (Or
tradeskills of course.)
