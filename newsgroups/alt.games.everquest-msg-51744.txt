    With the Ghoulsbane quest, High Keep has been revitalized to the point
where it's rather tough. There's an extra goblin spawn, about the same level
as a guard or lookout, in the Lookout, Guard, and outside the Raider room.
So a Guard/Lookout group has eight spawns every ten minutes to handle, and a
Warrior/Raider group would have nine per ten minutes. Given these mobs are
usually even or higher to the people camping them, that's quite a
challenge - people are sticking to the more traditional Lookout, Guard,
Warrior, and Raider groupings.

    Heh, I dispute this! Karnor's trains, and the amazingly destructive and
stupid Velk's Castle Trains have much more of a "Gah, we're all dead!"
factor.

    If the trains in Unrest get too bad, actually, the goblin camp near
Unrest zone is a nice place to hunt. I got levels 21 and 22 on my cleric
there. By that point about half the camp was greening out, though.
