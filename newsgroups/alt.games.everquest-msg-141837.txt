I have the runed circlet on my enchanter that shows up graphically, however
with the loss of my long pony tail.  Also, the Arcane Armor cap shows.  A
guildie of mine (necro) is currently wearing a head piece (sorry, cant
remeber name) the shows up with horns..so, it is out there, just have to
find it.
