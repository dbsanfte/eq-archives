For the beastlord epic, one strong group is still overstating it.

My friend did the beastlord epic a little bit ago.   All of the spirits are
roughly the same in strength.   Most of them were duo'ed by a 65 paladin and
51-53 beastlord.   One of them we did with 65 Warrior, 65 Rogue, 51
Beastlord.

The fights also don't take hours...  there are no raid situations like on
most of the other epics.   With the beastlord you can run around by yourself
finding out which scouts are up, then invite your friend(s) for a 5 minute
fight each.
