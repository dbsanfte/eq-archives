    Okay, it's obvious how to nuke-kite. You just SoW yourself, snare, and
run around nuking the creature til it dies. I know that some people do it
differently and more mana-efficient though at my lvl, which is 30 btw. They
go to an outdoor zone, snare the creature, fear it, and let DoTs kill it.
Now, I tried that last night and it just seemed like I would always run
outta mana before the creature died. Am I just killing the wrong creatures
(snow cougars in Iceclad) or perhaps I'm doing it wrong? If someone could
give me a general outline of how they do it, I'd be much appreciative. :)
