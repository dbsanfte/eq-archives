    You're an officer of your guild. Next time you're in a zone and you know
a specific mob is up, and what its proper EQ name is (like "Trakanon00"),
try a /guildinvite Trakanon00. Compare the response you get with the
response you get when you try and invite someone or something that isn't in
the zone. You have just discovered the power of officer tracking! ;-)
