>Seriously... A good relationship should have equal authority between

The two words that have gotten me through nine years of marriage are
"Yes Dear" :-P

I consider my relationship to my wife to be 50/50 as far as who's in
charge. When it's time for any "real" decisions we are a team.

On the otherhand when dealing with a woman over smaller matters, you
must choose your battles carefully. Otherwise you wind up fighting her
cats/dogs for room on the couch.

Cheers
