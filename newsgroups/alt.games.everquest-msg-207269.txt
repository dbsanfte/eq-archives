I don't know much about the high end game at all since my highest
character is a level 49 Bard.  I find all the responses to this
question quite curious.  I've seen the stats for the Singing Short
Sword and I am left wondering, is there a better weapon than this that
is specific for a Bard?  If so, what is it and what are the stats?
