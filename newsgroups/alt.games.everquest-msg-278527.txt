Operative word being "Can". The reality is that practically all of us 
WASTE more time than would ever be gained or lost by having a single AA. 
When doing Expeditions for example and swapping out a tank for another 
tank with more 100AAs there was no noticeable increase. Any theoretical 
efficiency gain was devoured by AFKs, telephones, morons getting lost, 
etc etc etc.

Plus recall that having an AA doesn't make you more effective, having an 
AA ability does... given that most AAs that would make you more 
effective cost several points we'll only see even theoretical efficiency 
boosts every nth AA, not every AA.

Lots of intelligent people run a split not because they think it will 
get them somewhere faster, but because they -know- its not a feature 
worth micromanaging in the first place, and setting a reasonable split 
and forgetting about it ensures both move at an acceptable clip.

As an aside, you can loosely generalize play styles from that 
characteristic. People who don't split generally are more single-
mindedly pursuing a single goal and are more prone to performing 
activities like grinding XP in safe places as quickly as possible. While 
people running a split are generally more laid back; they've set a split 
and they know the AA and XP will eventually roll in, and they don't 
really care which dings next or when exactly it will happen.
