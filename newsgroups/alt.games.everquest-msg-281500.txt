Equivalent geared SK's and Paladins tank at the same level - the difference
can often be pre-slow, the Paladin is mitigating more damage due to stuns.

It may be easier to better gear Paladin's, which might account for the
differences you're seeing.  Also, I find Shadowknights keen on spending AA
on their harmtouch and not on their defensive AA's.

We've a few SK's in our guild, all 67+ who tank anything guild groups go
and do fine, although probably only one of them is RSS capable.  For quite
a few DoN missions, my warrior was DPS in the group with the Shadowknight,
because his AC was far superior.

So are they still considered tanks - yes - if they've done the work to get
gear and the AA required in the high-end XP zones.  Paladins can cheat a
little bit by mitigating incoming damage via stuns.
