Yes, I know thats what he was saying - when he dragged it in it was not
appropriate to the population discussion for reasons I went into and he
left out. There was more than one issue, he isnt interested in discussing
the others beyond the one you cite.
Sticking to this specific point which is what I was doing in the post you
replied to he is still wrong. He cited his vasectomy as why he had
complete control and that is incorrect. Its not 100% perfect.
