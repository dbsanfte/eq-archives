I know for sure Paladins don't get this advantage.

I was grouping with a 30 paladin against Hill Giants in Rathe 
Mountains.  The Cleric was fearing the HG and the Druid was 
snaring it; this ended up being much more mana-efficient than the 
Cleric healing a 1000 hp of damage on my Warrior.

The whole time the paladin was complaining about having to run 
after the giant and that by running as well as fighting, he was 
running out of stamina and wasn't able to harm the HG by the end 
of the fight.  (It was his first and only character.)

After I asked him about two dozen times what his STA was, he 
finally said it was 112.  I then asked him a few dozen times what 
weapon he was weilding.  I gave up and inspected him, found it 
was a Messenger of the Queen.  Heavy weapon, 8.0 or so if I 
remember right.

Apparently having STA well over 100 didn't help him at all.
