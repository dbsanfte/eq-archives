I was thinking about the advice that several people kept giving me to
help earn money at a low level, to go to a higher level zone and loot
the stuff people leave behind.  I got to thinking about it and thought,
you know that would be pretty nifty, with the new thing where you go
back to your bind point with all of your loot.  All I have to do is run
to a new area, loot all the stuff I can, then attack a nasty MOB.  Then
bam, I'm back at the gates to Neriak, with an inventory full of stuff to
sell.  
I'm scared that this might cause a new rash of lowbies running around to
zones and looting off higher level's trash.  Begging for buffs and money
stuff while they're at it.
