Just because you've got a good hammer, don't think every problem is a nail.

I was in an LDON group in Mistmoore Catacombs, one of the assasination
missions.  We wandered around killing everything until the named spawned,
then hit IVU and headed for the named (/bless tracking!) stopping to kill
only when we hit a see-IVU mob.  Set up outside the named's room, used the
cleric's Pacify to single-pull the spawn, and whacked it with 20 minutes to
spare.  Then we tracked down the other named in that dungeon over the next
half hour, along with various other killing for XP and possible augments.
Group was Wizard/ Ranger/ Cleric/ Paladin/ Paladin/ Enchanter.  Nice for a
dungeon full of undead with Cleanses going off left and right, but hardly an
uber DPS group.
