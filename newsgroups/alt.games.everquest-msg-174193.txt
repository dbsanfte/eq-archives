"Giants: Citizen Kabuto" had to be modified before Walmart would sell it.
Blood was changed from red to green and a bikini was put on a topless female
character.

"Duke Nuken 3D" had a special Walmart version made with parental locks
turned on by default.

The Playstation release of "BMX XXX" had the nudity removed.

Walmart is the 600 lb gorilla, selling about 25% of all computer and video
games in the US.  I worked for a company that provided services to Walmart.
They told us we could only get the contract if we charged below cost.  We
did it just to get their name on our roster.  It was viewed as a marketing
expense to impress other potential clients.
