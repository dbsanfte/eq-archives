I have been playing for about a few months now after returning from a 2 1/2
year leave.  I started when the game was almost brand new and then quit when
DAoC came out... but not until SoL was released was the decision final.  I
started from scratch since I had given my account away to a friend.  When I
left I had a level 54 druid and 40 monk and 35 bard (level cap was 60 back
then).  I've done high end and I've done low end playing in my past history.
Currently I have a level 25 monk again with very little effort.  Leveling is
so much easier than it used to be.

Items... dirt cheap unless you want the really high end items.
Experience... really easy to get now.  Paludal Caverns has a very high xp
return and will get you through level 14-22 in no time at all.
Travel... you're rarely more than a zone or two away from where you need to
go.  No need to depend on Wizards or Druids anymore for gates.  With the
Plane of Knowledge expansion you can get to just about anywhere on your own
fairly quickly.
Death... you keep all your items on you and don't lose xp when you die until
level 6(?) now.
Communication... there are so many chat windows now you'll be lucky if you
can see your game play, lol.  You can communicate with people on other
servers too.
Higher end zones and an encounters have become easier for corpse retrieval
due to zones and caster abilities... so no more 3+ hour corpse retrievals in
the high end.
Maps... every zone has maps now built into the game.
User Interface... very customizable to show only the things you want to see.

I hope that helps you out a little bit.  :)
