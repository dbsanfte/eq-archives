You can go to an adventure merchant to see how many points you
have in that theme, how many total points and what sorts of items
are available to you to buy (and which ones are in the next tier
of items, the proverbial carrot).

The time limit is based on type of adventure - a group of 65's on hard
doing an assassinate mission, we got 90 minutes to finish.

This one was answered in a dev chat or thread on a class board:  The
is based solely on levels.  There are too many combinations of classes
to make it vary by class composition.

Only the members in the group at the time the adventure is accepted
may go into the dungeon.  So, you can drop people, but not add people.

Max level difference in beta was 10 levels, I'm not sure if that'll
be enforced in live, but I assume so for just the reason you said.

Well, my first adventure was a group of 65's, 1 beta-buffed (her
cleric hadn't been copied yet, and the beta-buffed cleric had
worse gear than her main) the rest were non-beta-buffed.  I was
by far the gimpest in my sub-NToV gear (RL has prevented me from
raiding much with my guild recently while they've been gearing
up/keying up for ST.  Even when I can attend I can't bid on drops
because my raid attendence has dropped below 60%).  They chose the
hard difficulty.

20 minutes into the dungeon our cleric, warrior and druid LD'd
and never came back.  That left a 65 bl, 65 mage, and 65 enchanter
to finish (and we did because the enchanter was a monster charm
soloer - she could have finished solo I think.)

The mobs were 500-600 hitters, the boss was a 900-1000 hitter.  I've
heard they boosted difficulty while I was unable to play the last
2 weeks, so they may be tougher now.  But, at that time they were
Tier 3 difficulty mobs.  I've heard they boosted them to elemental
difficulty in 65/hard dungeons.
