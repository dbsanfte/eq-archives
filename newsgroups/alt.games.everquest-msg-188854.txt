You might want to break out your EB item. In other words, don't hold your
breath. :-)
I deleted an old character something like a year ago and tried to get the
same name last week, it wouldn't take.  I don't know if anyone else has used
that name, though.  It was just a letter or two added to a name from the
random name generator, so that is quite possible.

Depends on which city and which type of Heraldic you like more. :-)
Rodcet Nife followers start in Qeynos and get Salubrious Heraldic.
Followers of Mith. Marr start in Freeport and get Luminant.  Of course,
Heraldic gear in general isn't cheap and is not at all useful as twink gear
due to the level restriction, but it's certainly something to work toward if
you like the character and take him to higher levels, especially if you
aren't in a raiding guild.
