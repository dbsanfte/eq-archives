Okay, to answer your questions:

Yes, you can buy a compass from certain vendors in the game, but they
are mostly useless. The best way you can tell which direction you are
going is by using the "Sense Heading" ability. You don't mention what
race or class you play, but from your description of a "Forest" I would
imagine you are either a Wood Elf or a High Elf. If you are a warrior,
then you should set up a hotkey that will use your taunt skill AND the
sense heading skill each time you press it. Otherwise, just make the
ability key for sense heading, and press it as often as you can.
Eventually, your skill will increase and you will be much better off
than if you had a compass.

Another thing you can do, too, is learn how to use the /loc command.
Probably the best place I've seen with information on this is at the
EQAtlas site (http://www.eqatlas.com/locguide.html). I use this alot
more than I use sense heading, as it's easier to head to a specific set
of coordinates than it is to try to figure out if you are North, South,
East, or West of Kelethin.

The Copper Amulets, if I remember correctly, are really useless. They
have no AC (Armor Class) addition, and they do not give you any
benefits. The easiest way you can tell, however, is by holding down the
right mouse button over the image of the item. This can even be done
before you buy something so that you know what you will, or will not, be
getting. Give this a try, and if you still have questions, just let us
know!
