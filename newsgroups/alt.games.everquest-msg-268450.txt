It is occasionally dull, but i suspect that i might be playing it safe. I
notice the people around me get injured constantly but i don't. I'm not sure
if this means they are just using high level recipes with nasty side effects
or they are just macroing through it. That said, it's pretty easy to level
and being able to make your own combat skill improvements to a certain
degree is very funky.

I would prefer being able to buy a house to just renting it; if you are
paying a subscription it seems to me they can allocate the database sppace
required for any level of house. That would encourage me to fill it with
trade-made goods, and anything you make and can see and show to others does
give you a great deal of pleasure. While there are other systems i've
encountered with far more versatility than this one (I've seen people upload
their art and music into their room's environment), I don't think this is a
bad compromise.

My major grip is that way too much inventory space is required. If your wife
tradeskills, perhaps she can make decent boxes and backpacks for you. I have
only fair quality ones, and even with as many as i can get, it's a lot of
shuffling to and fro the bank. I'd be happier if the bank was linked to the
crafting machines so that the machine checked the bank inventory for
ingredients. This wouldn't make crafting any 'easier', just less tedious.

I also dislike the fact that you can't sell offline. This would help
crafting in many ways; it's common to run out of one of the twenty or so
ingredients that might be required for a complex recipe, and the market
system really is underutilized.  By expanding the market to offline as well,
the materials you can't use could be quickly sold on, rather than destroyed
as i have to do now, and the ingredients i need bought from others instead
of them destroying them similarly. It would make for a more interesting
economy. Simply allocating a certain inventory size for everyone as sellable
goods would do it. After all, the broker charges a commision. Surely that
means the broker can work when you aren't there? Increasing the stack size
from 20 would also help. Perhaps you could combine 5 stacks of thyme into a
crate of thyme, for example.

Overall, I would say the crafting system is better than EQ1 but not as good
as SWG. It has the potential to be terrific and if people submit positive
feedback ideas, it will get there. I'm doing my best but with only one voice
i can not be heard, however, if you read this, and agree, or have a better
idea, communicate with other members of AGE and feedback.. don't use it to
bitch, they just filter that out. Remember, the guy who reads your feedback
has to deal with whining all day long, and the easiest thing he can do is
hit delete. Be positive and they'll read it and hopefully escalate it.
