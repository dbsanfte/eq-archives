Was going to start a new monk today.  After looking around I'm totally
confused.  Only got as far as deciding on an Iksar.  Some web pages say to
put all my start up points into STR.  Still others swear to put them into
STA.  Next, when I go to equip it, do I look for STR or STA items.  Also,
I'll be soloing more than half the time and wondered if that made a
difference?
