Not sure how many more Naggy raids I'll be able/inclined to go on before
I can't get into the lair anymore. (Depending of course on if 52 takes
as rot-in-hell long as 51 did.) But this week, I went on another one.
The CoF didn't drop, nor the GoFM. But Naggy did give me a little going
away present for this Christmas season.

If nothing else, I finally got the killing blow on the bastard that
first killed me at level 45. I realize that this is the gimpiest named
dragon in the entire game, but it gave me some sort of grim
satisfaction. An polishing him off with a crit (albeit a fairly lame one
with a one hander) made it all the nicer. I was so pleased I even took a
screenshot of the text.

Orlun captured a shot of me walking away from the kill with the death
message text up, along with the text showing that his group (of which he
was almost the only survivor) got the xp for the kill! (I wondered if he
suddenly made level 57 from that or something.) I also like the way the
shot shows the new Troll model and how my armor looks on it. I'll admit
to becoming fond of the new look.

And while we're in "showing pictures" mode, in case any of you haven't
seen the bug that makes people in wolf form look the size of large
hamsters, here's a couple of my guildmates in KC who just got wolf form.
Oooooo.... if I was a mob I'd be scared of *these* rat terriers on
steroids. ;-)

Have a good weekend, all. And good hunting. I'll likely be back down in
the Hole again. The xp there is insane.
