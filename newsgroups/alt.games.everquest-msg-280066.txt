Well,lets have a look where he got his numbers from(taken from his
FAQ).

>2. Where do you get your numbers?

My numbers come from a variety of sources, and some games have more
than one source.  These sources include the following:

a)     Corporate Press Releases �

When was the last time SOE published an official press release about
subscribers numbers in EQ?
Link it please.

b)     Corporate Documents �

see a)

c)     News Articles � From time to time, reporters for both online
and offline publications are able to get a hold of numbers that I have
not.  Care has to be taken, though, as sometimes a reporter can
confuse total sales with subscribers, or may simply regurgitate a
number that is many months old.  Still, if I find a number that
appears to be credible, I will generally use it.

Well,if he finds a number *credible*,he will use it,lol.

d)     Public Comments � Game developers and publishers will sometimes
make public comments about their subscriber numbers

These can be right or wrong,who knows?

e)     Anonymous Sources � 

I save me any comments on making up numbers from anonymous
sources.

f)       Educated Guesses � 

I save me any comments on making up numbers from educated
guesses.

>3. Your numbers are all made up or are just guesses!

I assure you, they are not.  It is true that many companies keep their
subscriber numbers confidential, but others are more open about it.
Almost all of the data I use comes from actual sources, although often
those sources are insiders who only give the information on the
condition of anonymity. 

I save me any comments on making up numbers from anonymous
sources.

All in all a very trustworthy source,rofl.
