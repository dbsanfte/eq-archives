I gotta agree, I think Assassination adventures are the most fun and I guess
if I was pressed for a preference that would be it. I like looking forward
to "the boss monster" and knowing that it's at the end of the adventure
means that I can pull out all stops and use the spells and tactics that
ordinarily wouldn't be applicable for the short-lived mobs along the way.
Fun, fun, fun!

Have you tried doing one on Hard difficulty? I haven't, but I think that
will be my next goal. We did a Hard Slaughter last night and WHEW was it a
doozy. We pulled it off with 2 minutes to spare and at least 4 deaths during
the mission. And this was with a very good group with a good puller. Every
mob conned at LEAST white to me, several were yellow and the vast majority
were red. Great experience, but very tough to slog through with maybe 50% of
my Slows landing. Fortunately, more like 80-90 of my nukes, so that helped,
but even with a good chanter and good cleric, we were on our toes at the raw
edge of survival throughout the night.

Of course, it's exactly those kinds of successes that we live for, eh? ;-)
