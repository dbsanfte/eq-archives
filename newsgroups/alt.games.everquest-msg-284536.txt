One thing you might look into would be getting your old account back. 
Despite stating otherwise, practically no characters have even been 
really deleted; SOE seems to realize its a lot easier to win customers 
back if they feel they don't have to start over from scratch.

Try contacting them and seeing if they can reactivate your old account 
for you.  Even if you decide to start a new character, if you do so on 
the same server where you already have characters, you can use those 
alts to drag your body or go in and scout situations you can't look at 
on your own... or not.  Some feel this sort of thing is as bad as 
outright twinking, and I suppose they have a point.

Something interesting that was introduced recently (and I see from a 
response in this thread that you're already aware of it) are the two 
Progression servers.  An interesting, although in some ways flawed, 
experiment; they started out with only the original three continents, 
and with some zones rolled back to their original content (split paw, 
Cazic Thule, Mistmore), and for the most part with only the original 
spells and quests.  After a month, Kunark was unlocked, adding Iksar and 
levels 51-60 and gear quests and spells that were ROK era.  It looks 
like the tasks to unlock Velious are complete, that continent will be 
opened around the 28th of August... future expansions to open gradually 
some time later.

No guild hall, no shrouding, no POK transportation... its hard to 
imagine how different the game is compared to what its grown to be on 
"regular" servers.

Even if this nostalgia doesn't get you, though, if you're starting a new 
character, you might find Progression servers of interest simply because 
they are largely populated by untwinked low level people crowded into 
relatively few zones, so finding a group where you want to play isn't as 
hard as it will be for a low level on a regular server... even Paladul 
had a population countable on one hand the times I went there recently, 
and that was BEFORE progression servers soaked up a lot of the people 
who wanted to play low level characters!
