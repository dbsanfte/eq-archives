Go out of town into the newbie area. (Zone name?I'm too lazy to look it
up. Anyway, it's not the one you go through to get to the bugs side of
Paludal.) When you leave the gates, turn left and follow the zone wall
down the hill. A bit past the last tents you'll find the book. The mobs
near there are non-aggro newbie mobs.
