Well, like I said, There was no one from the EQ team, just the other
games. Maybe his wording wasn't right or he just doesn't know whats
going on. or maybe the next projects have really already been done but
EQ is holding out for a while.

When you think about it, these guys probably have a libarary of zones
that have yet to be added.
They have Jungle zones, desert,plains,mountians, snow, air, water,etc.
so just think how many they have that just never made it live but they
can hack up a few together and "bam" new expansion.
