I miss that place. Was one of my favorite dungeons before it started
turning light blue. Especially back when half the rock golems were
unmezzable and no feign puller so 7 or 8 at a time. We probably spent
more time beside the dock deep in the Hole than any other one Exp camp
that I can think of.

That I wasn't debating. Since my main is a shaman I spent a lot of
time slowing and doing backup heals for a druid and I won't debate
that they do can handle an easy camp. I also know too many camps where
a druid/shaman combo where pressed hard to keep a group alive that
would've been trivial with a cleric instead of the druid. Probably
easier on the druid if you'd replaced my shaman with a chanter, but
now we're off on a tangent. My times duoing my monk with a druid
(around 50th lvl) didn't do anything to change my perception either.
Camps that would've been a trivial duo with a cleric or shaman where
difficult with a druid. 

At 58+ I think the healers are pretty balanced now but before the iCH
spells were put in I always figured that druids were pretty much
screwed as high end healers. A cleric can use his super efficient
heals on a good tank even if there isn't a slower around. A shaman has
slow and good high end mana regen to help out his crappy heals. A
druid had the same crappy heals as a shaman but pretty much needs a
chanter or shaman in the group to be a viable healer in anything but
the most trivial camps.
