My laptop:
Toshiba Satellite 5105-S607
P4M (not Celeron) 1.7GHz
512MB SDRAM (not DDR)
32MB nVidia GeForce4 440 Go

It's been several months since I played EQ on it (less than six, I would 
say), but the last time I did it still handled it pretty well. I did have 
to turn down the quality a bit and I chose to turn off some of the Luclin 
models, but it really handled it pretty well.

I would strongly encourage you to choose the nVidia graphics though. Also, 
I don't know if I would recommend a Celeron processor. As always, the more 
memory, the better. ;)
