The whole Epic thing was Kunark Era. Weapons and other items. Clerics rez
stick, chanters haste stick and Rogues hasted dagger were all very very high
end at the time and these three still hold the test of time for usefulness.
The other weapons were mediocre to average even at the time of them being
made.

All weapons have been outdated since Veliuos with NToV and AoW etc. Against
PoP they now look very poor.

Was always a rumour of an Epic 2.0 but has never come to fruition.
