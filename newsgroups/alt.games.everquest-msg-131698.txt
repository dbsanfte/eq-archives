I loaded the latest BETA drivers (30.30) from NVidia and the image
quality is better than ever in EQ. You might want to give them a try.

catagory)

They also have a tweaking program called RivaTuner that can really
make the card shine. If you are comfortable tweaking the settings, I
highly recommend setting the Anisotropic Filtering to level 4 or 8. It
will clear up the "texture craw" that you seen when running through
zones with grass textures on the ground. It also clears up a lot of
the "shimmer" that you see in chain type armors.

If you are using an AMD CPU with a VIA chipset motherboard be sure and
install the latest 4in1 drivers. (www.viaarena.com)
