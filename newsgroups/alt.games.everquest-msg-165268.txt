I recently added another account so my daughter and I could play together.
She decided on a half elf druid, and has been learning the ropes, but I
guess I shouldn't be surprised (actually, as a dad I'm happy) that my 14
year old daughter isn't all that happy about the fact that despite the fact
that she has items in all slots, she still looks like she's running around
in her underwear. LOL.

I've heard that umbral covers things up just fine, but that's obviously a
little beyond your basic twink. Allakhazam's fashion section has not given
us any decent leads. Basically, she'd like to find a set of leggings/waist
item that gives her something more truly resemblying pants. Silly thing from
a "power" standpoint, but it matters to her, and so it matters to me.

Nutshell question: What Half Elf Druid equipable armor is out there at a
reasonable price (or tailoring skill level) that covers her hiney? lol.
