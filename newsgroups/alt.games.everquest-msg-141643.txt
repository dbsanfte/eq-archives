Equipping the Blade of Tactics (blue blade of the warrior epic) in my off
hand raises my dexterity by 45 points. With it equipped, I seem to proc my
Blade of Tactics more often.   Yes, I'm aware I used the word seems, which
means I'm most likely imagining the effect, but at 14 dam 24 delay, plus 30
atk, it's not really much worse than my other possible weapon for the off
hand... and every little bit helps when you're counting on those procs to
help you maintain aggro.
