Hi All

For purely personal reasons, I didn't like *some* of the features of
the new UI Sony have given us (If you like it, that's great though,
heh). I like the old-style 2 X 5 Hotbutton bars, rather than the
horizontal ones, and I like the old spell icons, but actually like the
new, smaller sized-spell icons.  Sadly, using the old UI meant the
bank only showed half my available slots.

So, to get this going on your PC, do the following:-

1) Make a folder in the Everquest UIFILES folder, giving it a name
that suits you.  For purposes of illustration, I will refer to it here
as "NewClassic" and into it you will need to copy 16 files.

2) Into this new folder, copy the following files over from the
DEFAULT_OLD folder (that's where they were in my EQ directory,
anyway)...

	gemicons 1, 2 and 3
	Spell_Icons
	spellbook01, 02, 03 and 04
	spells01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06 and 07

3) If you also want the old 2 X 5 Hotbuttons copy the following file
over from the DEFAULT_OLD folder...

	EQUI_HotButtonWnd

Then, while running Everquest, load the UI with the name you have
given it - in this example it would be NEWCLASSIC.  Voila!  Nothing
else to do, as any of the other files needed to run the UI will be
added anyway by the Everquest program.  I now get the benefits of the
nifty new features of the new UI, but with the layout I have grown
used to over the years.  I don't have the newest expansion, so I can't
see if the 3rd set of bank slots shows up, though.

I post this here merely because some of my friends/guildies have found
this useful.  I hope one or two of you might find it useful as well :)
