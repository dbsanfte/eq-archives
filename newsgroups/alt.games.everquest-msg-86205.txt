Quake is also enormously fun . If you will note though quake is most fun
when there are alot of people confined in a very small quake board. Pvp
requires very close proximity while pve requires a sense of huge vast
expanses. I dont think you can get both at the same time. Spending 2 years
of character development to achieve a quake like game minus balance and then
to have to spend 99% of your time looking for an even fight while dodging
uneven fights that require a 45 reset time , is not an adequate model for a
succesfull pvp or rpg.

It does get a honorable mention for trying though.
