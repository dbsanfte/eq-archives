Hello all.  I have been playing EQ for less than a month and  I have been
lurking here for about  1
weeks learning what I can from questions and answers on this board.  Last
night a finally took one
of my charactors over Level 9.  I am soloing my Pal-Frog in No. Ro and East
Commons getting
great experiance and looking around seeing what other things are out there.
I go somewhere,
(can't remember where), near a large body of water.  From there I hop along
to Oasis of Marr I
think, and get killed by a "Madman somethingorother".  He was blue and not
really sure why I got
defeated so quickly but that is for another time.

Here is my question:  How do I find my body in this Oasis?  I did the  /loc
thing and it gives me
something like   " -2415.51 -351.0 -95.7 "  (This is not what the numbers
were, but sorta close.)
When I see those numbers from the  /loc  I look at the upper left of my
screen and I have nothing
even close to these.  All of my numbers are like  " 305  0%   0%   94 "  I
never see anything in the
negitive side, much less  .anything

I think I can find my body, I remember how I got there and I know I am still
the body of water,
but next time I could be in the middle of a desert, forest, swamp. etc.  How
do I use the  /loc
and the numbers in the upper left of my screen?

TIA
