What you've just described is a small possibility that would only be 
manifested on a very specific PC configuration - hardly any sort of example 
of the magnitude of dereliction you claim on SoE's part.

Admit it. Memory leaks, while being *promoted* by hardware is surely 
possible, are 99% of the time the result of the program, itself, reserving 
memory and not releasing it when finished with it, or releasing memory it 
still needs and expects to be available. Therefore, explain to me, again, 
why the number of crashing clients is inconsistent with that realistic 
estimate...grasshoppa.

Go ahead and wax superior about all the years of experience you have under 
your belt, but just understand that you're not the only programmer here.

By the way, the fact that you continue to *pay* to play a game you so 
zealously criticize says far more than any of your self-indulgent postings.
