Specialization is remarkably easy to raise, in my experience.  Only if for
some reason you want a specific unusual specialization should you even
worry about this at all; most people want the spell line they cast the
most to be their specialization as well.  If not, there are three remedies:
Only put a point into the specialization you want until it is way ahead of
the other four.  Sit somewhere safe and chain cast a spell in your
specialization of choice until it is way ahead.  Oops, wrong specialization
happened?  Go to temple of Ro and get it reset to 50, then do method 2

This last is particularly interesting for someone who knows he will be using
some alternate specialization at high levels: a mage, say, can specialize in
Conjuration and use it happily for quite some time, then at high levels
switch to evocation as that line becomes more important to him (or vice
versa)
