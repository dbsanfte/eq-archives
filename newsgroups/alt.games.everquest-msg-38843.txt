Ohhhh so you're the oracle we're all looking for. /em bows down before 
the master. So from what I can gather from your cryptic message here is: 
You're a.) At level 61 since "No one exists who is of any higher level"
	 b.) Clearly using some sort of mind altering drugs from the         
	     gibberish you've just spouted.
	 c.) the one with the "vision".
Wow I want some of whatever you're smoking (drinking, injecting, etc.)

Well bub, I hate to tell you but your "observations" stink. I've not 
noticed any perceptible decline in server populations as of yet. But I'm 
sure you'll let us know when you "observe" VI's imminent collapse. And 
(since I'm still trying to figure out what you "cited") could you kinda 
clue us all in? If you're quitting fine.. just DO NOT make one of those 
pathetic "I'm quitting and here's why" posts. PLEASE!!!!!!
