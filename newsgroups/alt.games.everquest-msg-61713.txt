With respect, not all of the people who are poor typists and writers are
under the age of 30. In fact, I'd be more inclined to say that a greater
number of poor typists/spellers are over the age of 30. In my experience, a
good chunk of the 30+ 'net crowd are indeed horrific with spelling, and
sometimes even grammar. However, the important part is that their meaning
gets across in a way that is easily understandable. 30+ folk will very
rarely use d00dsp33k, or too much abbreviating in their writing.

I've said for years that people who wish to use the internet should be
forced to take mandatory writing, spelling, grammar, and stupidity (*grin*)
tests. For instance, I'll be 21 in 13 days, but my writing certainly isn't
all that bad. Should I be forbidden from playing on your mythical server
because I'm not 30 or older? Both in real life and in-game, I've run into
people who are 5+ years older than I am, yet are less mature. Age is not an
accurate indicator of maturity level or intelligence, and that's what we're
really talking about here, isn't it?

What a nice place the real world would be if it were the same way. ;)
Unfortunately, until we can get our geneticists to isolate the "idiot" gene,
I think we're stuck with coping. =)
