  I have heard GMs and Guides in chat recommending doing a direct copy
before to avoid having to do as much patching, and to preserve your
preferences, ect.  I don't think EQ adds very many significant registry
entries so it shouldn't foul anything up too badly.  I haven't heard of
anybody who's done a direct copy having any special difficulties.

  So I would say go for it.
