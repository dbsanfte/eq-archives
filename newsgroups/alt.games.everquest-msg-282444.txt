Of course they are.  Call one a nigger to his face and find out what their
true opinion of people using the word is.  Those that use it (that actually
put any thought into why or whether they should) seem to often claim that
they are using it as reverse racism, to eliminate the power of the word.  In
the same articles, discussions, talk shows, news shows, documentaries, etc.,
the older black people almost unanimously agree that it is a bad idea.  Not
the first time a younger generation has ignored the wisdom of an older
generation.

Slavery has been around and practiced by people throughout history.
