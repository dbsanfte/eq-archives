Are you serious?  I guess I should be glad that Innoruuk has a
calendar for Hate/Fear.  It's not perfect, but it does prevent stuff
like this.  Even the asian guild that has decided to violate the
summit generally doesn't do more than poach a few epic mobs, and that
hasn't been much of a problem recently.
Do other servers have a generally accepted scheduling system for Hate,
Fear, or other contentious zones?
