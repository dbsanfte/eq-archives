You could eventually get 'leet gear' farming spiderling silks at level 
5.  (And at level 5 you don't need great gear anyways either.)

That's hardly seeing much of what the game has to offer though.

What your saying is true; but everquest has so much more to see than 
sitting on the edges of zones (which is where these 'xp groups' you are 
talking about tend to sit). Saying its 'not required' to put yourself in 
ituations where you are committing blocks of time is like syaing its not 
required that you ever make level 5... its true... but so what! how much 
of the game are you missing? ... Most of it!
