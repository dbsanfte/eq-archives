Hi y'all... Since I play at such erratic times, it's really hard to find people I can play with on a consistent basis.  So, I decided to create a "BYOG" 3-person trio.  Now, I'm at the level where I need advice on a hunting grounds.  What I'm ideally looking for is a spot that a puller can pull do, with a limited amount of adds.  A spot tailored to a tank, that has healers.  (Basically, I find it difficult to cast anything other than heals & buffs with the occasional DD/DoT thrown in).  Anyways, I suppose I should lay out the group setup...

51 Warrior (at the computer I play at)
50 Druid
49 Cleric

The characters have *okay* equiptment - nothing twink-like for their levels.  For example, the Warrior typically wields a Veno Axe / Frostbringer, has SCHW, and hodge-podge armor.  The Cleric & Druid both have WIS around the 220-ish level.

I need a spot to park the Cleric & Druid (it is absolutely no joy running three characters around, particularly when something's chasing you :), where they can heal and buff the warrior in peace while she beats on stuff).  Decent loot would be nice, but is not a priority.  Decent experience would be super, but again, that's not too important either (dark blues would be fine).  Outside zone would, of course, be preferred.  

I've been to Burning Woods (skellie / gorilla ruins) which has light blue and greened out to the warrior.  Tenebrous Mountains (Coterie camps) but didn't like it too much (because of adds - aliens and wolves always make things difficult at just the wrong time).  Rockhoppers never seem to be up when I check DSP, so have never done those.  Mons Letalis didn't work well for running three characters myself (but is nice when I find a 'real' group).  Maiden's Eye was a no-no running all three alone (seemed impossible to pull a single).

So, any advice out there?  'Twould be greatly appreciated!!  :)

Mhisteena - Level 51 Human Warrior - Veeshan

and...

Fujikomo - Level 36 Human Druid - Sullon Zek

My wife plays EQ with me from time to time (her name is Christina), hence all the Mhist* names.  :)

P.S.  Looking for a guild on Veeshan that could use the services of the above mentioned characters!  :)
