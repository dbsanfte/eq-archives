I use EQIM, although not the one that Sony provides; I use TEQIM which
is a Trillian Pro plugin.  I certainly hope that using this service
doesn't count against your rez timer.  Since I'm often logged in to
TEQIM for more hours each day than the game itself, this would be bad.
 However, I've never noticed any huge jumps in my /played time,
although I've never done any hard tests.  Although, I guess since your
rez timer supposedly goes as long as you're logged into your account,
I suppose it won't make a difference.  But it seems like they should
be two separate things, because I can use TEQIM while my trader is up
in the bazaar, and I think the Sony EQIM doesn't let me do this
(although I don't know for sure).

Sorry for the ramblings...anyway, confirmation would be very nice.

Game on,
