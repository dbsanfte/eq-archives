And on what basis has his mother blamed the game?  I know this doesn't fit
in with the current American and British psyche, but sometimes things happen
and they *can't be helped*.  Sometimes it's just a tragic accident or
unfortunate set of circumstances.  Sometimes - sorry to upset the lawyers
and all - there ISN'T anyone to blame.

She no longer has a son because he killed himself as a result of his
depression.



> What if EQ caused the depression?

Then why are't we all dead?  If EQ can cause such extreme symptoms in an
otherwise stable and well-balanced person, why doesn't it cause them in all
the other stable and well-balanced people who play it?  There was something
wrong with this youth that went far beyond EQ, far beyond any computer game.
His PERCEPTION of EQ might have been something to do with it - but then the
vast majority of players don't have that problem, and how can Verant be
expected to account for every possible mentality while they're building a
game?  If we're going to start holding them responsible for mental problems
in the people who buy their games then they, and every other games
publisher, would be well advised to shut up shop now.  Once they've done
that, the movie industry must follow.  Then the music business.  Then book
publishers.  We've already got lawyers pushing the easily-influenced and the
greedy into forking out their cash to apply blame to anyone for anything in
the hope of grabbing a juicy payout - and as a result we live in a world
where free enterprise and freedom of expression are being threatened,
because soon no-one will dare to do or say anything for fear of ending up on
the receiving end of a lawsuit.

Where negligence is proven then it should be accounted for, of course.  But
an accusation does not - or should not - constitute proof.  This writer was
using sensationalist gossip to try to make his point, and I don't believe
there was any purpose there other than to demonise EQ.

Conceded.  But what I said was that depression rendered rational analysis
impossible.  In any case, there are few circumstances under which I would
consider suicide to be a rational choice, whether or not it seemed to be so
in the mind of the suicide.

If EQ can be proven responsible for the death then it must be shut down
immediately, as must all other similar games, since they are clearly a
danger to the public.  But of course it isn't responsible.  It might have
been a factor, aggravated by existing problems, but common sense surely
tells us it was not the problem in itself.  As I say, if EQ is intrinsically
likely to induce suicide, why are more of us not dead?

But I would be surprised if the goal of the legal action was to shut EQ and
its companion games down.  I have no doubt that the goal, as in the vast
majority of such cases, will simply be to obtain large amounts of money from
Sony.  In essence, as I say, to put a pricetag on a life.

The article as a whole was negative and, I believe, intended to propitiate
the great god Hysteria - albeit in a more subtle manner than is usual
amongst the journalistic community.

Enough ranting.
