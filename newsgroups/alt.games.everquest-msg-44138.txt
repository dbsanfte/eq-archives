 That depnds. I'd say it more like: The big reason to get up your OT
faction is to get the hammer that procs a gate to OT. You need to be
amiable for that quest. By the time the hammer can proc at level 50, the
only thing that will aggro you is a skeleton that happens to be green.
Run off the boat, kill the skeleton, invis up and run out. I'm KoS at
the outpost and use my hammer all the time.
