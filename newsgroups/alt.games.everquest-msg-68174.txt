    384 is a odd amount everything should be multiple of 2, : 16, 32, =
64, 128, 256, 512. there is the in-between like some people have a 128MB =
and a 64Mb for 192Mb. 256+128=3D384. Well from what I read and I don't =
know if its tru and all but I always but the Larger Ram in the first =
slot, or Slot 0 (zero) there should be marking next to the slot on the =
board, also there may be trouble with the speed of the ram some =
computers don't like you to mix speeds, i.e.: a old ram ran a 66Mhz now =
you cant buy that without special order most is PC100 (100Mhz). Seeing =
your running a PII I and Win98 you might have a older mother board that =
runs the slow speed, the speed really shouldn't matter as it will only =
run as fast as the mother board, if your 256 is the fastest then it =
should work fine in the 0 slot. I have a 66Mhx 128 and a 100Mhz 128, for =
a total of 256, the faster one is in slot 0, no trouble.=20

    My computer is a minimum as it can get, I really thing the culprit =
is the Low Video ram people have everyone in my family play EQ including =
me that is 6 accounts with 6 computer with 6 different setups, I have =
the slowest of them all, But what I have that 2 of the computers that =
cant get on EQ now is a 32MB video card, theirs is 16MB AGP. I have a =
PCI card so that isn't it my card is also out of date and no longer =
supported and the company is out of the vid card market. Video Ram is =
for storage off Textures, Main motherboard Ram is for holding all the =
data that the processor needs like map and player data. The biggest =
update to EQ is there Textures, Esp for those without Luclin you still =
got the new textures, the textures are bigger in size and detail, they =
used to be 24bit they are now around 32bit and there sizes can impact =
lagg, you need more video ram to hold the larger texture information. =
you might want to look for a TnT2 that has 32MB of ram, there is some =
here selling for $65 it should be enough it doesn't have all the fancy =
stuff like a Geforce 3, but it will work on the low end systems and is =
cheap.

    well this is allot more info but it should help. also check your =
eqconfig.ini File for a line like: UseTnL=3DFALSE, if your old vid card =
doesn't support special Texture and lightning effects then ass that line
