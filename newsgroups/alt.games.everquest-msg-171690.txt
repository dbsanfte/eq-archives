VoG lasts over 4 times as long as WR and adds ATK which is one of the most
desired post 60 game stats so best both for the casting Enchanter and the
tank I'd say - unless your tank has a sub-par haste item in which case get
a new tank as he most likely isn't able to keep mobs off you/break mez
properly either. 

Once you've had SoV there's no going back though.
