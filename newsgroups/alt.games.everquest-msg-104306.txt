Has anyone else experienced the Gamma problem and found a solution for
it.  I've searched the internet and have tried just about everything I
could get my hands on.  I've tried driver after driver and have gone
as far as totally reinstalling Windows XP... and still I suffer from
it.  At this point any advice or suggestions would be welcome... just
don't say get rid of XP.  ; )
