So far so good.  New players have a reason to buy it (getting the full game),
and existing players have a reason (the expansion and goodies).

Umm, because then your first account won't get the expansion?

If you want two accounts, you're gonna have to pay for two accounts.  And pay
to upgrade two accounts as you continue to use them.

I can't follow your logic.  You bought a second account and you think you were
cheated because it didn't come with an upgrade for your first account?
There's lots of stupid annoying things Sony does, but this one is your
fault, not theirs.
