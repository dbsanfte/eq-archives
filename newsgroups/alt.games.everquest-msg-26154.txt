As they're pointed out, add the word 'count' anywhere after the /who to
get a numerical result rather than a list. As for whether it counts anon
people, I'm pretty sure it goes:

/who all count   = Everyone (including anon)
/who anything else = excluding anon

Try:
/who all count
/who all 1 60 count
