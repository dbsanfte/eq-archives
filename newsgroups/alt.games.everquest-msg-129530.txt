At L20 you're too low to stick any spell on any hill giant.  At around
L25 you might be just high enough to stick spells to the lowest level
HGs, but I can't see you having a snowball's chance in hell of actually
killing one solo even with Clarity, too many resists.  At L30 you
might could kill one out of every four or so you tried, hardly worth
the effort.  OTOH, at L29 or higher you'd be a real asset to an HG
group and at L34 you could duo and do very well.
