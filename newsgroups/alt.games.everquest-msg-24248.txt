This is going to sound weird, but bear with me...

One of the things I've found is that if you dont like the detailed
drawing/texture/whatever for something it is *far* more immersion
shattering than if its crudely done - when its a crude representation
(text based, outline, simple model, and up) I find it much easier to
"tune" it out and impose my own fantastic representation on it. I 
interpret it, in the same way as I'd interpret a paragraph of
descriptive text, with the nuances that make my immersion complete.

When its photorealistic its much harder to do that; the reality is
already presented, and it takes much longer to learn to tune it out,
at which point I find I'm already pissed off with it ;)
