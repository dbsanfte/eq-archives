Well, the information about the old Grieg's was quite limited, and I
have yet to find some decent info on it since the revamp.  Alla's
comes up with basic mob info and most of it is pre revamp....

If any of you have experiences or knowledge to share, Id greatly
appreciate it.

your time and effort are appreciated.
