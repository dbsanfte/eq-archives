I couldn't logon with my level 30 Monk over the past week or so. Well,
actually, sometimes I could and sometimes I couldn't. Just so happens that
the other night when I couldn't log him on, my wife was in WC with her Druid
and and happened to see a shout by a  level 9 warrior wearing my name...
bingo, problem found =)

Took me a couple of days to catch both the other character and one of the
GM's online, so that we could get things sorted out. It was settled amiably
tonight, with the newer character being able to select a different name. I
even made him a promise to direct any tells from friends of his to his new
name... least I could do, as the screwup was software related, and certainly
not his fault.

Anyone ever heard of duplicate names getting through the filter before? This
is probably at least partially my own fault, as I couldn't believe that
particular well-suited name for a Monk was still open when I picked it
several months ago. Guess someone else thought it'd be nice for a warrior as
well =)
