**Most people know the story of Jesus,but just don't have any good
reason to believe the Bible.
How else are they going to believe in any of this famous story?

Prove the Bible is inspired, and you may get some people to consider
what you say, and take it seriously. It's not enough, any longer, to
just tell the Good News, without some kind of back-up evidence.

People are not going to give up their comfortable lifestyles or
"sex,drugs and rock n roll" for no good reason.

how can they repent when they dont' know what a sin is?

How do they know what is sin, anyway?

The bible?

Prove the bible first. No one believes it these days.NOt evena lof of
churches!
 Too many contradictions, errors, and unbelievable stories.  Not to
mention, restrictions on carnal pleasures.
To believe the Bible is to read about hell, damnation,s uffering God's
wrath,etc.
Not a pleasant book to read.

Why should anyone WANT to read a book that tells people they are
sinners who will suffer for all eternity if they don't believe a
2000year old *legend* which isall it is to some people.

No,you need to prove the Bible in some way or another, so people might
consider it is divinely inspired.

in peace

and God's Love,

Harmony
