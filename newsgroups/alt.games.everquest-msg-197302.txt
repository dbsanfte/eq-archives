Nah, weight in the range 60 to 70 I was practically glued to a
fixed altitude above the terrain.  Other chars with weights over
100 have happily launched themselves off the same hilltops (in QH
and NK where I noticed this) many times in the past.

One of my favorite little jaunts used to be levitating in DL.  If you
got up to a high enough altitude (and kept moving) you either didn't
fall at all or fell so slowly it was unnoticeable.  In DL there're
spots to launch from that are noticeably higher than the top of the
north zone wall, you could run across the main part of the zone at
10k fall altitude, ignored by all the mobs far below you, and angle
down to land at your destination.  It was fun.
