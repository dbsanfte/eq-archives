I started playing in March of 1999.  By July 4th I finally got a 2nd
character up to level 14 (3.5 months).

My current oldest (chronologically) character is a level 22 DWF CLE that was
created on 4/1/99.  I have 4 other characters in their 20s, a level 49 druid
(my first MAIN character) and a 51 enchanter (one of the youngest,
chronologically, born in May, 1999, I think).

Oh, I also have a few others in their teens, and a couple still in single
digits.

I have 2 accounts. :)

You are not alone.
