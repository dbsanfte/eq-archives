Ah. Go search on the shamans crucible or rangers glade at
www.interealms.com - it includes screenshots of the event happening.

If you believe the screenshots and guildies messages there then its
true, it happened, she was a very lucky Oracle and used lots of

I believe it myself - its not like it was a warder from sleepers
or anything.
