Not even that they're providing the maps, though perhaps they are.  Just
that they're enabling the map feature in all zones.  Previously some zones
wouldn't display a map.  ToV, Time, etc., though some of those have
sometimes allowed a map and sometimes not, depending on how buggy the map
restriction code was being.

I always thought it was ludicrous that the mere act of zoning into some
zones had an apparently large enough impact on my character's IQ that he
would no longer be able to put pen to pad and draw a map of where he's
walking.   =)
