Greetings,

Why doesn't anyone want to trade languages?  I know it takes about 20
minutes to learn a language but it seems no one is interested.  I asked all
through Rivervale, West commons, east commons and west freeport with no
luck.  Is there some location where people gather to learn languages or do
people just not care?

Cousin Raven
