Umm...Maybe the wrong place to ask for an objective opinion.
From what I have seen of AC, EQ is better but I have not put in any time
with AC, just seen others playing it and heard from players.

When I first bought the game I came to an this ng, not sure if this was to
ask a question or just read up but I saw all these debates on camping and
stealing camps and spawns and thought "OMG this sounds sooo boring, petty
and over populated" I was told not to worry, that there were plenty of
quests to do in the lower levels up to 20...that was about a yeah and a half
ago, still playing...I level slow because I never made it a priority to
level (until now as I need to stay in touch with my guilds mains for raids
and events)
I would not choose AC at this time as there are definite plans for AC2,
whereas there are none for EQ just further updates and expansions.
There were meant to be a few new MMORPG's due for release soon so you may
want to hang on for a while before making a decision on either AC or EQ.

EQ isn't nicknamed Evercrack for nothing
