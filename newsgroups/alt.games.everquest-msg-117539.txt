The gator pits have more goos like the sewers do but of a somewhat less
virulent nature till you go in deeper. One of the spiders in the maze also
sees invis , so wandering around invis is chancy at best.

The brown lizards are no joke at all. There channeling skill is so high that
they are not interrupted even by multiple forced movement/knockback. Since
some of this type are clerics it gets really anoying. If you plan on doing
the brown lizards bring plenty of mana suckers.

Bring an sk to taunt if at all possible and either a magician or a shaman to
malo/mala . The mr on alot of the mobs is high enough that it will require
every mob to be mr debuffed to mez/slow. I ended up using rapture a great
deal since it is a lure based mez and frequently there is no room for a
bounce.

The sewers are not as bad an exp camp as you think. I held with
sk,chanter,magician,druid for 6 hrs keeping all the phs dead. Good equipment
and aa points are probably necesary for this though.
