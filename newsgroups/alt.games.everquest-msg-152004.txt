That seems to be what im finding too
Anything i can snare dies, even if it does take a while
Usually my mana regens enough so there isnt much if any downtime
Im on eruds crossing at the moment with my druid
Ive been kiting wisps since level 7 and now im level 11 i can kill cats
The cats all con red to me and are as high as level 17 sometimes but i 
can still kill them with a druid
With my wizard i couldnt do the cats till 14 or 15
To put this in perspective it often takes a lot of trys to get the snare 
to stick with much running around
and even when it sticks the ignire spell gets resisted a lot but 
gradually i wear it down and it dies
I dont know whether this continues into higher levels but if so i dont 
see any reason i cant solo very fast upto the higher levels
