Huh? What are you talking about?

The AA points for regen gave DOUBLE what everyone
else got for Troll and Iksar. Now it works the same for everyone.

They get the benefit like everyone else, just not double anymore.
It doesn't *replace* anything. It adds on top of their normal regen
just like every other race.
