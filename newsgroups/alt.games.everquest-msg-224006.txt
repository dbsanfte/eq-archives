It's only an exploit if you are doing it in order to bypass parts of the 
quest.  Doing it multiple times because it had been reported in the past 
that sometimes your faction is not high enough after having completed all 
of the steps in order is a work around to a bug.  Doing it more than once 
due to losing the NO RENT gem is not an exploit either.

Plausible reason for redoing Woe and Envy would be you go LD for over 30 
minutes and lose the NO RENT gem that you need to turn in to a wisp in 
EJ.  Also you may just not have realized it is NO RENT, and camped 
between steps.  Only way to get this gem back is to turn in Woe and Envy 
again as I understand it.  SOE made it so that this particular step is 
one you may be forced to repeat due to circumstances beyond your control, 
and yet, now they are saying that if you do repeat it, you will be unable 
to finish the quest.
