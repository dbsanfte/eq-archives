He's right. The cleric is the one who saves my ass not the tanks. If a
mob is on me I will be dead before any tank can taunt it off even an
Sk or a Ranger. A single heal though will quite often switch the mob
from me to the healer, which give me time to mes it and thus save the
caster. It's not perfect, it wastes mana and tanks don't like to hear
it but its true.
