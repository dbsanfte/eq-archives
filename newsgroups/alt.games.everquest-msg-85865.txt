The biggest benefit of Rune spells is that, even tho you are hit, you have a
MUCH
better chance of getting a spell off while under agro. This doesn't seem
like much,
but a well timed Mez has saved my chanters butt more time than I can
remember.
When you are grouped, and an overpull could spell disaster, the extra
seconds that
a chanter has to cast area mez that could turn the disaster into a
well-controlled fight.
