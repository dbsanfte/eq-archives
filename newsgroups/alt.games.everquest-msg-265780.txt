I've been playing the WoW beta a little, and while it's fun, I'm
having trouble taking it seriously - it's just TOO cartoony, and my
Gnome is just TOO cute.

She's a bad-ass, no doubt about it, but just too damn cute.

Also, I picked Engineering and Mining as my two tradeskills (you're
limited to 2 now - not sure when this went in) But I found they're
permanent.  I'd assumed I could get rid of them when I found a
Tailoring and Skinning trainers, but this proved not to be the case.
So if I want to give Tailoring a try, I'll have to start again.

I think EQ2 will be my choice, though.

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
