Yup  Like Dira says, it reduces the aggro radius.

But to add a couple small things to his observation.  From a distance, you 
can't see the spell hit the target.  But if you get close enough, not too 
close mind you, you can see the spell land.  PLUS you can see the other 
mobs in the vicinity take AE harmony - since it's an AE spell.

If you can't get close enough, just harmonize them all, 'cept for the one 
you want to pull.

I heard Harmony can't be resisted - is this true?
