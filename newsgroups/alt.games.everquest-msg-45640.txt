If gnomes can tolerate barbarians in their banks and visa versa why
shouldn't it be possible that the Gnolls would have a bank and would
allow you to use it if you had preformed sufficient service to their
Race/Alliance to warrant that?

Sure they would, it's called a letter of credit, however in a world
with magic letters of credit are done thru instant communication via
magic :-) Basically this is the Asherons Call system of cash transfers
without the actual Items that were used for transferring the money.

If you make the average cost of the NPC bind more expensive then the
average cost a player would charge then the option to bind at any time
exists while not seriously impacting the casters. Besides I'm not sure
the idea of casters getting cash because of some built in ability is
fair to other types of characters. Should Meleers charge for taunt?

Tell me how the cops, nation and merchants in your city would react to
the killing of a Banker or Cop?  Upstanding important members of the
community get special protection plus this lessons the value of grief
killing bankers and guards which is possible for exp under this
system.

If an NPC is trivial he should not exist. Every NPC in the game should
do something worthwhile.

In other words some merchants if you kill them don't give exp. Now all
NPC's will give exp unless they are green.

This counters the perma KOS from scowls by starting all characters at
maximum negative faction of Threatening, which is recoverable from.

True, but if it is to be a RolePlaying server then there needs to be a
reason (but not an absolute restriction) on divergent classes or races
or religions from grouping. Ogres eat halfings as anyone who has been
to Ogguk can see, so shouldn't halflings know this and  there be a
penalty for breaking the "suspension of disbelief" that the games
history and fiction create?

Trivial Combat code, ie Warrens loot rules :-)

The idea is that since the server is PVP based you either need to
carry insurance (thus providing a money sink for the game) or you need
to understand you can lose all your stuff. I would venture to say 95%
of the people on this server would have everything insured.

This server will not penalize Power leveling thru buffing at all
except with factions. That's not too high a price to pay considering
there are no level restrictions on buffs.

It would be. Most players would have everything insured and that
provides a money sink to the game also.

Again its a fairness thing, IMHO meleers shouldn't be penalized for
being meleers, plus there is added downtime with limited bind areas.
Also 10 plat per bind is a money sink and Money sinks are good. :-)

If you walk into a room full of people do you automatically know who
does what work or goes to which church?  Shouldn't your actions
determine who you know? If your character stats are restricted to
these areas then only people you know directly (you the player) or
characters whose Race/Class/ etc are on good terms with you, ie
someone you could generally walk up to and say "So your a warrior
right?"

That's why the stamina loss hehe. And yes I was going to add the
weight increases stamina but didn't since I think that might unfairly
hurt casters as well. On the other hand a ratio of the total weight to
the total str would be a good means of determining stamina loss and
would fit casters and meleers both equally well.
