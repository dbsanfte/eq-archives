1)Kill things yourself for about 30min to buy your own equipment with alot
of FUN + exp(actually playing the game)
2)Beg for about 2hr with lots of marco/typing and send tells after doing
/who 1 60 all(yep that's how they find you heehee) and no exp

Which one would you choose?
Begger: #2 Of Course!!! Do you know how hard it is to actually kill things
and earn money without all the SPELL and L33T equip?! Only Noobs will choose
#1............ BTW can you spare anything?
