Sadly, I have to agree. Melee can be twinked *far* better. But it's
still damn nice to have the double mana pool. True, you're not killing
mobs faster when all is said and done, but you can do more in a row
before you sit down to read your book while you med, (*grin*) PLUS (and
this is the big part) I think it really gives you a bigger safety margin
so you die less, which is a huge improvement in leveling rate. J-boots
are also a godsend in twinking for a non-SoW caster, but they can be
given to melee also to equally good effect, so that sort of cancels out.
