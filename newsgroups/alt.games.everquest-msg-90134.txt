HUH?!?! wtf are you smoking? Wizards rank 4th for solo work... and that's IF
they can land a 'root'

Only if the mage knows HOW to use the pet... and the zone pathing is PERFECT

True... but then they ARE limited to Line-of-Sight for the powerful stuff...
and pets have an annoying habit of blocking that line.
Also Mage nukes are Magic OR Fire based... no Ice damage for Magi

True... but that's not what would swing it for me.

Uhmmm... how is THIS different from any OTHER nuke-class? Everyone who
throws nukes around is going to raise his taunt-profile with a Mob

Hmmm... SKs and Necros must LOVE your Evacs... dropping a half dead and
petless Necro in the middle of a bunch of NPC Druids/Treants just means his
CR is further from his bind point!

Druid healing shouldn't be relied on after lvl 24... that's when Clerics get
G Healing while us Druids are still stuck on Healing. And WHERE is the mana
coming from while this Druid is Nuking, buffing, DSing, Snaring AND saving
300 points for an Evac?

Well... speaking as a Mage and Druid... you're WRONG... The things you
expect from these 2 classes can be done better by a Wizard (nuke and evac).
They have much better mana-to-damage than either of those 2 classes in
short-fight grouping situations where the Mobs are coming thick and fast...
and tho it pains me to admit it, Wizards DO get much better port/evac
options than Druids. Wizards also get a much wider selection of spells that
can do something NOW... and a good wizard learns (sometimes painfully) which
options are best in any given situation.

You've obviously not spent much time in dungeons where a fleeing Mob is a
train-waiting-to-happen. Sure snare is good for keeping dangerous opponents
where you want them... but when you want that thing dead NOW, before it can
get round that corner... then nukes are the way to go... and that means
Wizzie Powah! ;o)

Sounds like you've had a few bad experiences with people who have a problem
playing Wizards... don't let it cloud your judgement. They're a class where
it's easy to get things wrong on a regular basis and still achieve a
resonably high level... to a point where too many simple errors creeping in
can prove fatal. It happens, learn from it.
