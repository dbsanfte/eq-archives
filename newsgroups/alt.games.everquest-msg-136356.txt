I dunno about that......

I think the main reason clerics cry for FT items is because they are one of
the "key" classes in EQ.  The mana they regain is far more effective than
had a druid regained it (for example).  Or a wizard regaining it over a
magician (not so if mod rods are needed in large numbers, but on short big
fights)

Im not sure mala would stick without malo first.  Enchanters.. hmm our last
RC killing we actually had like 4-5 phantasmists there, more often than not
we have 1 bot though.  1 magician

And would you really use alternative measures versus something like RC
(extremely high DPS till slowed) just cuz you couldn't be bothered to wait?
I dont buy that :)   Maybe every other mob in the zone, but not when the end
mob comes in, and its something like RC.

Enchanters just tashed too remember, so assuming they didn't already die, I
bet even 1 slow attempt and they are dead (whether it lands or not)

So the mage modulates, he has mana now, but hes sitting at 50hp or so.. he
could have regained mana faster than hes going to regen that HP.

Ah yeah, I forgot about beads... funny how they got nerfed for monks main
use of them, but the necro exploit hasn't ever been touched.. damn biased
verant :)

Well FG has a tendancy of getting pretty busy, so i don't pull to a safe
spot (omg my shrooms would be perma stole), I fight at the wall near a
shroom patch.  I get adds, but it doesn't matter.  (Unless I take a break or
afk, i can keep the whole patch down so it pops 1 by 1)

I don't bother with small heals, cheal is so much more effective.. I can get
4 procs in a row (which would be extremely unlucky) but I'm still good for a
cheal.  I cast it at 800hp or so, it lands at 400-500hp, bingo 5k+ cheal
with little/no risk.  If im dropping too fast, /disc stone will see me
through (with a 3minute or so reuse).  And I still have mend remember.

I very rarely use mend in exp groups/with other healers.. mend is my "get
out of jail" card for when the cleric fucks up (FD has a flag that says if
your below 100hp, don't have disc, and the heal is late, FD WILL fail)

Anyway,  Aego on me, BoaR on him, Resist Disease when I remember to.  I MoR
all my pulls, and use my BP to MoK them

Focus of spirit, Riotous Health, no other stat buffs (easily at 255 stats
with avater).  Sometimes regrowth, never the AC buff.
Slow every pull (dont need to debuff first), can't use JBB (im a lizard
/cry), don't have epic (still at final part heh).. I cast a dot a few times,
I can't do it every fight tho or im oom.  So I cast pox

Not surprised,  just not sure it does increase my kill-rate overall.  I dont
think it does.   I went into velks yesterday, would pull 4-6 spiders at the
same time, would MoR them with the cleric, cast a cheal on me.  5 mins later
when they were all dead, the cleric would be 95+ mana, and I'd be ready for
another 5 or so mobs.   With my shaman, even with faster kills from haste,
dot, maybe even pet, well the kill rate would still be a fraction of my
monk/cleric combo.

you.

keke, the shaman is me :)

See above.  I don't bother with nuking much, maybe if i wasnt a monk that
had to spam-press that damn kick/epic button then I would feel more inclined
to cast extra stuff.. or actually if i wasnt so lazy and didnt have to cast
more than i need to

careful,  with these new cross-server tells, im gonna spam you when you
don't expect it, and you will miss your cheal in the emp rotation :)
