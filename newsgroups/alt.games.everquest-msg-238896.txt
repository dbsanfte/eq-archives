Not much if you start with evolutions (the boxed set of
many expansions plus EQ) That is all you really need
since the other expansions are higher level. In fact, all new EQ
expansions seem to only be higher level. That is my main reason for 
leaving the game.


>what are your options?

? Meaning? Do you mean for payment? If so, you can buy a three
month game card or something or just pay monthly from a credit card
or visa check card or something (which takes existing money from a
checking account, so its a good option for someone without a credit
card.) Its about $12.95 a month.


>at what level do you really feel like you are enjoying your investment?

Beats me. If you start out in Luclin or one of the good, newer areas
you can enjoy it pretty fast. The old world is kind of crappy and
passe', though they did redo some of the newbie zones. 


>how much time do you need to enjoy the game?

Its a tremendous time sink game, even though they've accelerated much
of the play. Eq's entire design was based upon using timesinks, or
needing lots of friends, as equalling difficulty. They've turned away
from this in some respects but overall the game is still like that.
Most of the difficulty is based upon waiting. You wait for groups, if
not grouping you wait to regain resources. For those reasons I find
Anarchy Online to be a much better fit for my life currently, it
involves basically no waiting at all, even if soloing.


>what kind of system do i need?

If you use all old models and all old textures, as well as all LOW
world textures,  the requirements are really not that high with
clipping set at 5 percent or so. You could really get by with a
pentium 2 400, 512 meg of ram and a geforce 2 64 meg card or more. 
The better your system the better it will run, though, as well as
being able to use luclin models. Its moving to Direct X9 only now, so
you would need a card which supports that. I have always stuck with
nvidia cards since they use a unified driver and even older cards are
direct x 9 compatible still.
 

>what characters are the best to play?

any.

>can you buy the basic everquest and be content?

No, its old and outdated. You'd be buying  a crappy everquest, while
also wasting money since you'd want the other expansions eventually.
The best bet is to get EQ evolutions on sale or something. You just
won't get any kind of a feel for what the game is really like from
just playing old eq. All of the advancements came with later
expansions, such as more detailed and interesting quests, scripted npc
events, etc.

A big problem with EQ, for me at least, was the fact that they hardly
ever upgrade old content. So as new content comes out, the old is
mostly just tossed aside and wasted as the player moves on. Most areas
are no where near as good as newer ones.
