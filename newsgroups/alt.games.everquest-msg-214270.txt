1) Many classes can 'locate corpse' or even summon a corpse. If you play 
one of those you will never 'misplace a corpse'.

2) EQ has a coordinate and map system that is easy to use, which makes 
finding corpses pretty easy for the most part. Much more so than AC in 
my experience.

3) EQ has other features like invisibility spells and spells that root, 
mesmerize, or lull (so they don't aggro), and skills like sneak and hide 
that can make corpse recoveries from dangerous areas less trying than AC.

4) All that said there are some places you can go where getting your 
corpse out if you die is a royal pain in the butt. But for the first 10 
levels you don't have to recover your corpse, so you'll get a bit of a 
feel for how it works, as long as you explore and don't spend all your 
first 10 levels sittign in one spot killing the same spawns over and over.

5) At higher levels Corpse recoveries, and death in general is generally 
  less of a hassle. You'll be working in groups that will know how to do 
it, and the Planes of Power eject corpses into a 'safe' graveyard for 
you to retrieve them, etc.
