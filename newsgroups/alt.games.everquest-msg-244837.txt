Yup.  Earlier today I was in the Bazaar with my halfling and I saw
the top half of an Iksar protruding from the floor near a bank.
I paused and did /em is tickled to see someone shorter than herself,
but got no response so I assumed the player was AFK.  Shortly after,
I camped and logged back in as my bazaar mule, and passed by the
same spot.  Saw the same Iksar in the same orientation, but this
time he was standing on the ground as normal.

Also saw a mob in Shadeweavers walking along with just its head
above the ground.
