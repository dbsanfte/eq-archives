NO!  Definetly not.

All it would take is a little effort.  Leading the subject line with
the appropriate [EQ] or [EQ2] would work fine for making the
distinction as to which post is for which.  It works well enough in
some other groups I frequent (r.g.m.w and r.s.p-w) and will work fine
here.

There's enough cross over between the two groups, as well as a
knowledge base of the original EQ that splitting the groups would be
detrimental to both.

The main thing is making sure the header tag in't stripped on posting
a follow-up.  Be consistent and set an example, and correct newbies
for a bit, and it will be fine.  It's no different than correcting
top-posters.
