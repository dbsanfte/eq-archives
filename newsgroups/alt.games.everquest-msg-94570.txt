Hmmm, I haven't seen any maps of the zones that I frequent on eqatlas.  I 
love eqatlas, and think it is hands-down the BEST mapsite going, but it 
just doesn't have anything on the high-end zones.  I was in my mid-50s 
when the sites started charging for full access, so I paid for eqmaps.  
Yeah, the maps aren't the best, but for the zones I want, and especially 
for the drop info I *need* (class rep, much easier if I'm aware of 
possible drops before they happen), it made a lot of sense.  If there were 
an alternative that listed the zones I need, I would use that instead.  
However, the following zones are NOT mapped at eqatlas at the time:  
Chardok, Howling Stones, Veeshan's Peak, Skyshire, Dragon Necropolis, 
Siren's Grotto, Velk's Lab, Wakening Land, Acrylia Caverns, Akheva Ruins, 
The Deep, Fungus Grove, Grieg's End, Maiden's Eye, Ssraeshza Temple, 
Umbral Plains, Vex Thal, and all five planes.  Very few 50+ zones are 
mapped, which is a real shame, since I have only seen one other site that 
maps as well.  (Map Shop of Norrath has incredible Kunark maps, and they 
are adding more maps, but they're not comprehensive.)

That being said, I will be purchasing a subscription to Allakhazam 
shortly, just because the pocket change cost will make it that much easier 
to ensure that bards get the loot they deserve and other classes don't get 
screwed too badly.
