Stretching?  I'm not claiming my trader needs speedier performance.  :p

Actually, the research has already been done for you and is available right
here in this thread.  The answer that you claim doesn't exist has shown up
in at least 4 different posts, though the people posting didn't necessarily
know they were giving the answer.

It's also not going to be something that stops all crashes.  Hey, sometimes
the game just crashes.

Example of a bug that wreaked havoc *and was ignored for months because not
enough people knew about it for it to be an issue*.  I wasn't using that to
support any theory of a "regulator" on traders, merely as an example of
Sony's course of dealings with regards to mass-awareness of bugs (and/or
intentional "bugs").

But then I'd imagine the distinction is beyond your grasp.  But feel free to
toss a few more epithets, jackass, as it makes your lack of any actual
substance at least amusing to read.  :)
