Yes, kiting is an option for this character. Druids are masters of kiting, 
which is just as well since they majorly suck at close quarters. They are 
good at slowly dealing damage while keeping the mob at arms length so as 
not to get hit back though. You should find that because of this they can 
solo melee-based mobs several levels earlier than a warrior, since their 
basic tactic is not to get hit in the first place.

OK, solo kiting... at 33rd level you have a few options. Make sure you're 
sowed (nothing worse than having it drop halfway through a kite), snare a 
mob and:

1. Nuke/blast kite - run around with it while you chuck DoTs and DDs at it. 
Note that DoTs won't take full effect since it isn't rooted/feared - this 
is kinda inefficient.

2. Root and rot - better IMHO. Root it, DoT it, then med until root or DoT 
breaks and reapply as necessary. Rather slow and boring, but you are 
rolling your medding downtime into the time spent killing the mob, so 
although it takes much longer to kill something this way you should be 
ready for another straight away.

3. Fear kite - if its an animal, slap a fear on it (panic animal, terrorize 
animal), then chase it and beat on its back while tossing in some DoTs/DDs 
as necessary.

4. Charm it - probably not a good idea if you're a low CHA halfling, but if 
your mob is an animal, charming it as a pet is an option. Helps to have it 
snared first, in case charm breaks, then do /pet guard here and pull to 
your pet. Rather than do the necro thing and have your pet chase a feared 
animal, I prefer to snare and root an animal (root not really necessary but 
I have a Tunare Warden symbol so what the hell), charm it, pull another mob 
to it, have them slug it out making sure my pet just wins (if things are 
going bad for it a damageshield is good since it gives it the edge but 
doesn't last for ages like your pet buffs, feral spirit etc), hide to break 
charm and finish off the pet to get xp for him too.

Now, when you hit 34, you get a bunch of new spells and one will completely 
change the way you play this character (or it should) - Lightning Strike. 
Most druid AE spells either radiate from the caster (tremor etc) or are 
rain type spells, pummelling a particular spot with damage every tick or 
whatever (no good, since whatever you cast it on will have moved by then). 
Lightning Strike is different - it is a targettable nuke that radiates out 
from the target, to hit a maximum of 4 mobs. Welcome to quad kiting. From 
34 you have another option:

5. Quad kite - snare 4 mobs. Run circles around them like a sheepdog until 
they are all grouped up into a tight bunch. AE nuke all 4 at once, run away 
a bit, turn and repeat until they're all dead. An AE spell does less damage 
per target than your single target nukes for the same mana but it does it 
to 4 mobs at once, so if its doing 180 dmg a pop or whatever, that is 
720dmg in total for 150 mana or so - very efficient. You should be able to 
wipe out 4 mobs on 1 bar of mana and get about 2 blue bubbles or so. The 
trick is to find mobs that you can kill on one bar of mana (otherwise 
you'll have 4 pissed-off nearly dead mobs after you and no xp), and a safe 
place to kite. At 34 I found cougars in Iceclad good, specifically on Tower 
of Frozen Shadow island. Wolf-form yourself (this makes you amiable to snow 
cougars, KOS to the good quest-giving gnolls but they are on the other side 
of the island). Levitate yourself. Regen can help too, since you're bound 
to get hit a bit setting this up. Snare 4 cougars and pull them over the 
edge of the island onto the rocky shore at the base of the island. Now 
tighten them up and run them up and down the rocks (hence the need for lev) 
- nothing paths here, its a great place to have some space for kiting 
without getting any adds. That should be good for a few levels, after which 
you could try ulthorks and walruses in EW, or dire wolves in GD.


Some helpful links are http://www.eqdruids.com (general class info) and 
best for strategy/hunting guides is

The spells you will want to use at 33rd are:

SoW - you probably know that one
Wolf-form - Faster than SoW and has an ATK buff, but does make you KoS in 
some places (Gnomes/Coldain/Gnolls in Velious, Halas)
Ensnare - improved snare, lasts for 10min instead of breaking randomly
Ensnaring roots - your best root, although you may find your lowest level 
one is better to mem if you are using it for parking stuff to med when 
you're low on mana
Creeping Crud and Immolate - your 2 lines of DoTs, a magic based one and a 
fire based one, they stack with each other.
Combust - fire based nuke (switch to the lower level Careless Lightning if 
you get resisted too much)
Greater healing - duh!

At 34 the significant changes are that you get an upgrade to your Creeping 
Crud DoT, Drones of Doom, an upgraded nuke, Fury of the Air (higher damage 
but long recast time, so may want a second nuke memmed if blast kiting), 
and the aforementioned quadkiting spell, Lightning Strike.
