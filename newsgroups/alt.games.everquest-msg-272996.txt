You are wrong. Read a history book. Read lots of them. Its
immaterial what those constitutions say if the local sherrif has you
in jail and doesn't give you the phone call so you can call for
federal help. It has happened. If you don't want to believe it
happened, then don't.

] The fact that you believe that people are just thrown in jail without

Since it has happened to people, your claims that it cannot is
absurd.

Why do you think the civil rights laws were passed if they weren't
needed ?

Any claim that it was just a few redneck towns doing it is absurd.

A more accurate statement would be: I said if he made a vaild
complaint they were stupid for doing so.

The overreaction doesn't come from my posts.

No, you and others went off on an absurd tangent claiming nobody had
ever been jailed without the jailee breaking a law.

You might look up the internment of the Japanese-Americans sometime.
They didn't break any laws. They were rounded up and shipped off.
Didn't happen in a small redneck town. It was national policy.
