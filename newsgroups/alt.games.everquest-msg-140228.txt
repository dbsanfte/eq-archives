I've not seen this posted, so it may be local to me.  Here goes.

Downloaded the patch just fine.  Autoplay kicks in .. nothing.

Here's what I've done so far:

- Clicked off Autoplay and started manually.  No change.
- Deleted eqgame.exe and redownloaded.  No change.
- Deleted eqgfx_dx8.dll and redownloaded.  No change.
- Commented out the NewUI entry in eqclient.ini.  No change.
- Removed all TSRs.  No change.

I'm not using any custom skins.  I can see EQGame in the task list ... the
game simply will not start.  It's as if the task is hanging on something,
but I don't get a 'Not Responding' flag.

I have internet connectivity with my other machine, so it's not a
connectivity issue.

Anyone else have this since the patch?

TIA,
Crash
