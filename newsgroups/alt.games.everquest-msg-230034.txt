    Notes on this: in PoP, there is no known point of diminishing returns.
Using GM buffs, people have noticed solid returns up to 2900 AC, which is
well beyond what can be legitimately obtained in game. So on the more modern
content, bigger is always meaningfully better.

    It's almost impossible to estimate ATK without multiple massive parses
at varying AC levels. And that's too much of a pain in the behind to do just
to find out exactly how little armour one can get away with.
