True, it doesn't justify pet owner stupidity.  However, I maintain that I 
am not a stupid pet owner.  When there's been trouble with a pet on a raid 
for us (which hasn't wiped us, yet, that I've seen, except for that 'too 
freakin much push!' thing) the thing that stands out is that it's almost 
always the same name before "'s warder".  And it's a name of a guy who 
has /pet hold, oddly enough.  Somehow, banning non-hold pets on raids just 
doesn't seem like the practical solution, here.  Of course, banning him 
isn't such a good solution either, since he's really a very nice guy.

But I really don't see where any of that makes -my- pet the criminal...
