It's attitudes like the above that has turned me off from porting anyone, other
than guild mates or someone on a CR for any price. Period. Previously, when
asked I'd only say *whatever you think it's worth or can afford.*

Granted, when I first got my group port spells, I thought I could finally make
some decent plat. I was wrong. It detracted from  maxing out skills,  leveling
through experience gained, and looting the fruits of my hard earned labor.

I have five other non Druid - Wiz characters and none of them ask for or beg
buffs or ports. It's no real hardship.

It gets real boring, real fast to be innundated with demands for a port within
30 seconds of zoning in or porting in somewhere.
