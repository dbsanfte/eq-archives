I played EQ from Phase 2 of beta to just before the launch of SoL. I've 
been out of EQ for almost 2 years now, but for some unknown reason I'm 
starting to get the damn itch to play again.

So my question to you all is this: Is it worth it to start EQ again with 
a brand new account or am I just looking back on it with rose-colored 
nostalgia?

Oh, and another question - does the Planes of Power come with Kunark, 
Velious and SoL too or is it just the original EQ + the planes? I can't 
really tell from the box and it says "Includes Everquest Classic" or some 
such nonsense.

Anyway, thanks in advance.
