This is one of the ongoing debates with enchanters on several boards.

My advice is to get the gear you need to get your CHA over 200 then go
do your normal exp groupage.

Try with your CHA as you normally would then try with your CHA over
200.

I personally have verified to MYSELF that CHA over 200 helps with mez
resistes.

I have never tried charming with low CHA so have no opinion on that.
( I do get my CHA as high as I can when charming )

Why would they give us so many ways to increase our CHA?

2 Spells
Multiple types of jewelry
Most good enchanter items have CHA

Don't take anyone's word for it.. try it yourself and let us know
