I know that I already responded to this post, but something came up just
after I posted that prompted me to post another response.  One thing about
this article that bothered me was the above statement about "friends" that
are made through the game.  The mother also did not undersand, she did not
feel that her sons game relationships were "real" friends.  Just after I
posted my response, my teenaged daughter told me that just last night she
found out that one of her "chat" friends had been killed in an automobile
accident.  She has known this young man through chat for over a year and
they have even exchanged gifts through the mail.  Her shock and grief is not
any less because she never met him face to face.  How would she react if I
were to belittle this relationship and her feelings over his death by
telling her that he was not "real".  My son also lost a friend about a year
ago that he had played Quake with for several years.  It was very tragic for
him.

This mother, and this writers attitude toward "online" friendships is
insulting.  The game is fantasy, but the people on the other end of the
keyboard are not imaginary, whether we know their "real" names or not.
