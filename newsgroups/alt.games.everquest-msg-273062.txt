Mine was a toungue-in-cheek post.

The link is good AFAIKT.  It's Overlord Mata Muram.  An 88/88 raid encounter in
OoW-Citadel of Anguish.

MM casts this spell:

Mata Muram's Gaze Single Target, Magic (-600)
1: Decrease Spell Haste by 90%
2: Decrease Attack Speed by 90%
3: Decrease Stats by 300
4: Decrease HP when cast by 4000
5: Limit: Combat Skills Not Allowed

How much does that suck?

I figure this clown is an order of magnitude more difficult than Kerafyrm.  But the
players are also much more powerful than they were when Kerafyrm was downed last year.

One thing's certain - it would be a helluva battle.
