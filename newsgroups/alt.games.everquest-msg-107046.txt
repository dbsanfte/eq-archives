Still stalking the FAQ, Ronnie?

Did you tell him that the only person who EVER
complained about the FAQ, was you?

In fact, you got flamed because you stalked it,
didn't you?

Do you stalk the FAQ in alt.sex.voyeurism, Snake?

>He

Really? Let's have a look at the truth here.

I typed the first part of the very phrase,
concerning netiquette, the one that seems to upset
you so much;
"Ignore "trolls." Some people get a thrill from
posting "flames" (really" 

Google came back with 564 hits.

Not as obscure as you make out, is it?

These are some of groups on just the first page.

rec.sport.pro-wrestling 
rec.arts.marching.drumcorps
rec.arts.drwho 
rec.pets.birds 
rec.arts.tv.soaps.misc 
misc.transport.urban-transit 

Apparently, it is also in a document called "The
AOL Ettiquette Guide Recommends"

Are you still going to try and push the line, that
I made it up?

>because he was

They are not my comments though, are they?

They were lifted, and acknowledged as being
lifted, from other sources.

>really made any differenece whatsoever.

They certainly make your eyes bug out, every time
they get a mention. Which was an unexpected bonus.

Post the evidence, Ronnie. Or admit to being a
liar.

Really?

Have a look at your favourite website, Google.
There are more than 200 alt. groups that have a
FAQ.

I'm not a lying jackass, like you, though, am I?
