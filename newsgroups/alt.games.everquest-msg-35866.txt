Getting the relevant maps from http://eqatlas.com/atlas.html is a good idea
before you start.
Aside from the Highpass Hold or Runnyeye routes, both of which go through
Kithicor, there's the southern route. Qeynos Hills> West Karana> North Karana>
South Karana> Lake Rathetear> Rathe Mountains> Feerott> Innothule Swamp> South
Ro> Oasis of Marr> North Ro> Freeport. The Oasis is the most dangerous zone but
if you run straight north to the lake then due east to the coast and follow the
coast north then you'll probably avoid the dangers there. HTH. :)
