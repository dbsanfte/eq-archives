I can see this working myself. Zone-Wide message: "An un-natural
silence descends on Lesser Faydark." Thus everyone in the zone is
alerted that something is about to take place, while at the same time
all the annoying chatter is cut off.

They also need to have a special Invis effect just for the GMs that
nothing can penetrate and that returns after a GM spellcasts.

Then during GM events there are always a couple GMs hanging around
nearby under cloak looking for the morons that start spamming and/or
attacking story NPCs too early. The morons in question then get
Worldkicks. If they come back and start making more trouble they get
some time in Limbo...


An option that might work (but would lead to some nasty flames about
'Verant PC lackeys') would be to forewarn some of the roleplaying
guilds. Then these guilds can be there in force - and then make the
entire zone PvP with no limits on who can attack who (on top of the
above suggestion for silencing zone chatter). Idiots are soon slapped
into oblivion for daring to lay hands on the King's daughter.
