It's for keeping score of all the games of /gems you play. :-)

No, really, those crystals are the rewards for doing good/evil missions
as part of the Dragons of Norrath expansion.  They're similar to the
Adventure points from LDON in that you can use them to buy stuff at
special merchants, but the crystals can be sold/traded among players.

Yes, though I do wish they'd made it a stone instead of a door.  I find
it weird that I can walk through a door from PoK to the Bazaar, then walk
through a door from the Bazaar and be on the moon.

By the time I could get myself in that much trouble, gate potions were
not too expensive.  Though I admit there were some earlier levels when
I might've been curious about exploring one-way paths such as Dalnir
and Kaesora, and held back because I had no fallback if I couldn't fight
my way through.

A few months ago, as part of the lead-in to the DoN expansion, Lanys
T'Vyl turned up with an army (and a dracolich) and kicked all the
pansies out of FV. :-)  The "good guys" have taken up residence in
the former Drolvarg lair in the eastern part of the zone.

By the way, if your task told you merely to speak to a particular NPC
(as distinct from, say, "explore the inn run by so-and-so"), your
compass should've had a mark showing the direction to him, and you
should've gotten a message on zone-in telling you to check the compass.
Easy to overlook, of course, especially if you don't happen to face in
the right general direction so the mark isn't visible.
