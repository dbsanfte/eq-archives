I used to have Bind Wounds next to HT as hotkeys...I just about survived
that mistake and moved the BW key to another page. Caused much amusement to
my for my Guild when I told them.

Done the Snare trick before with my Druid and used to have Clarity and
Dazzle next to each other in spell gems (Dazzle is a hotkey but clarity I
just click from the gem) on my enchanter...only made that mistake once
before moving the gems further apart.

As a Warrior you can't make these sort of mistakes, closest I can think of
is taunting a group mates pet while in combat...they have a habit of turning
on you and yes, even on blue servers, they can hit you...not sure if that
was fixed at all.
