It returns only the current TCP/IP settings... the local IP, the subnet 
mask and the gateway as I configured them. There is no 127.0.0.1 
loopback anywhere. Does ipconfig have a more verbose mode?

I'm not running an antivirus (not using IE or OE keeps me pretty safe, 
although I do an occasional checkup with Housecall. All clean so far), 
and I didn't change my security settings previous to whatever killed the 
network.

Thanks for the help.
