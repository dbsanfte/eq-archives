Speaking of running out of arguments... The inescapable fact of the matter 
is that evolution *can* explain all the "amazing facts" you are referring 
to, but conversely, creationism (or "intelligent design", as they want to 
call it these days) cannot explain all the many design fuckups that are also 
very real and very evident.

Else, do explain to me why whales have pelvic girdles... God having a good 
laugh at us?

Ahem... Perhaps obvious to you... Without having to go as far as Remington's 
four arms, I see plenty of room for improvement, like for example not having 
our own immune system go bananas and kill us of massive inflammation at the 
merest sniff of a peanut.

I still haven't heard one single solid argument in favor of "intelligent" 
design. As for arguments against, there are as many as there are genetic 
defects.
