Actually, on the boat, you didn't need to hide in back.  While on a boat,
you are supposed to be indifferent to mobs not on the boat.  People who get
attacked on boats usually have one of two things happen.  (1) Someone
running from the mob led it onto th boat, or (2) the mob was in the water in
the boat's path and got onto the boat.

Those little rowboats you find in places like Oasis are even more
interesting.  Not only are you indifferent while on them, when you jump on
and take command, it wipes you off the hate lists of any mobs that are mad
at you.  E.g., go piss off some orcs and zombies and skeletons, and then run
to one of the little boats and take command, and the mobs will stop chasing
and wander away.  Leave the boat, and they return to their normal KOS state,
but won't come after you unless you re-aggro them.
