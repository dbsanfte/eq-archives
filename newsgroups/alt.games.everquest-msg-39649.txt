Ok, so I'm heading to the bank in N. Freeport last night from the
commonlands. I zone into W. FP newbie area and, as usual, run to the
corner to go through the secret hole in the wall into the tunnel.  And
what to my wondering trollish purple eyes should appear? Instead of the
friendly merchant who always hangs out there, there's a guard. Just
standing there. I con him, and he's BLUE to me at 47, so he's not one of
the little wussy ones. He's a steroid charged newbie guard. Name of
something "dungcaller" or some disgusting name like that.
   Of course, he attacks me immediately. I start fighting him, but I
quickly see that this is a fight I"m going to lose, so I ran past him
through the tunnels and made it to the N. FP zone line.  I assumed
somebody had pulled him to there, but when I came back out a while
later, he was STILL THERE, standing where the merchant used to stand.
  What the hell is the deal with this? Why have a freaking tunnel for
the evils to use if you're just going to stick some big ass guard there
who could probably munch anybody under 40 in very short order? Or was
this just an abberation? Anyone else run into this character?
