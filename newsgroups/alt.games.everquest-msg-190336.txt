Actually, I'm just an Average  Joe who doesn't have the money to buy
plat like my friends do.   Am I envious of all the nice equipment my
friends have now?  You bet I am.  If I had the money, I'd probably be
doing the same thing their doing.

I only picked on Yantis because my friends have been bugging me lately
to buy some plat from him.  They say something is up & I should buy
some of this cheap plat before it disappears.  I've been looking at
the playerauctions site for a little over 3 months now (wishing I
could buy something) & I have to agree with them that something is up.
Starting about a month ago, Yantis suddenly has millions of plat on
every server which he is selling for less than what he use to pay for
it (per posts on the playerauctions board).  Most of the posts related
to this issue have been deleted by the playerauctions admin.

I don't have anything against Yantis.  If I had the money, I'd buy his
plat.  It just seems to me that all this extra plat has increased the
price of nice items in the bazaar, which I don't like.
