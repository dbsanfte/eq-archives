We have an Aragorrn in my guild.  The port-mule of our most mature
guildmember (both physically and mentally).  I'm still not sure why he
would use such an obvious name, especially since he role-plays his
paladin as well as any I've ever seen.  
Of course we also had an Aaragorn until he burned out on EQ.  He
wasn't as mature, but he was most definately not some no imagination
punk kid.
Both of these folks are long-time roleplayers.  Maybe they were doing
it as a tribute, hell, I don't know.
