woh- can we keep this elitist attitude out of the game please.
Newbies are people who are playing the game because they WANT to play. I was
that way not very long ago. I am still learning the tactics, so I guess I am
still 'technically' a newbie, I have 3 characters at about level 12 or so.

Without the patience of both members of this news group, and hte players of
my server, Drinal, I would have stopped playing long ago.

As soon as experienced players snear at those just learning the game, the
game will loose its appeal, and the game will die. Only by the addition of
new players can the game live.

Verant will stop producing new upgrades and bug fixes as soon as new players
stop joining. Its a matter of economics.

DON'T stop helping new players. Ok. there is nothing worse than begging. And
as a player, I have never wanted anything I couldn't earn myself. But as
soon as experienced players start insulting me for not being as experienced
as them, when I ask for advice, either in game or in news group, then the
game will loose its shine for me, and I will move onto another game.

The real appeal of EQ for me was the willingness of those players who had
already been there, done that to give tips to those just starting. THAT is
what kept me playing. The sense of community. NOT the idea of working
towards a level 50 character.

I am already giving tips and unwanted gear to newbies myself, at level 12,
because that is the kindness I was shown, and I, personally, want as many
new players, coming into the game to get the right impression as possible.

For a lot of people real life sucks, there is no reason why the world of
everquest should be the same.
