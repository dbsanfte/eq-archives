And yet, by Verants own words, they have more subscribers than ever
with many more starting every day.

Yes, SWG will be easier, but will it have the kind of addictive power
that EQ has?  I don't think so, but will have to wait and see.

They why didn't they just put newbie corpses on a longer corpse timer
than they are now?  Say two days or something?

By level 5, I was in Blackburrow with my first character.  And I
learned the hard way about the trap in the tree.  I lost that corpse,
which was frustrating and annoying, but it made me respect the fact
that dying in EQ was a Bad Thing.

Sure, it's easy if you know what you're doing.  Consider the newbie,
who wanders into Blackburrow at 11 and falls down the tree hole.  Now,
since they play rate has been accelerated, that means he's been
playing a couple of days maybe.  He won't have any real knowledge of
how the game works, and it's doubtful that he'll have made the kind of
friends that could help him crawl all the way down there and get his
corpse out, and there's a pretty good chance that he isn't even going
know that there are such things as a summon corpse spell.  So, now
he's naked for the first time without gear or support.  How
frustrating is that?

Yes, but right now, which game to you play more of, AO or EQ?  From
what I understand AO has WAY less player retention than EQ.

At 11 he will have no experience to prepare him for the increased
challenges of the game.  At about level 10, most classes begin to have
a hard time with even cons.  So, now they can't fight things as tough
as they used to be, and now they lose all their stuff when the die.
How is this going to make the game easier on them?

Unfortunately, not all players are going to have the kind of knowledge
of things like a seasoned player will.  If I lose my corpse and don't
know where it is in a zone, I know that Bards, Necro's, and
Shadowknights have that handy locate corpse spell, but when I was
level 10, I can't tell you that I knew.  And it took me a LOT longer
than it will take a new newbie (say that 5 times fast) to level to 10.

Hell, I don't think I figured out what Harmony did with my druid until
I was up into my teens.

My point is that it seems to me that without any real consequence for
death early on, it's just going to turn the learning curve for newbies
into a freaking cliff at level 11.
