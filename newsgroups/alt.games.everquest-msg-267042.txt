Each spell has several servsions.
You always get the Apprentice 1 version for free. You can buy App2 which 
is very slightly better and crafters can smake and sell you App3. There 
are other better versions too which are dropped, quested and crafted.

Some will. Some only work in groups where other people can use their 
skills in the same heroic opp wheel.

Quests and the newbie zones like the caves and so on. Antonica is 
probably good once you get to 10 or so. Won't take very long if you do 
the quests for citizenship and your class quest.
