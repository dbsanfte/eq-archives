On the bright side, it's well nigh unto impossible to cause the damn thing 
any permanent damage. I rolled mine off a 2nd floor balcony onto a concrete 
deck during my days of playing on my porch on my laptop (pre Luclin, my

Autorun, and lean back with the trackball on my thigh.

That's the one occasion I sometimes Feign with the mouse too :)
