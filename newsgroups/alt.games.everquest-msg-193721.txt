I'm relatively new to EQ, been playing a month or so.  My bf belongs to a
guild, and seems to have constant problems with it, and I don't understand
the whole thing.  If a person is in a guild, are they allowed any personal
time for pursuing their own EQ interests (without having to create a new
char)?  I can understand some of the benefits of guilds, but... I don't
know, with all the bad experience he is having, I'm just wondering if I even
want to deal with them.

Opinions?!  Input?!  Much appreciated!
