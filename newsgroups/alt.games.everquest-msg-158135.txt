WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO???  Did you ever work for Verant?  Are  you
mad at them???

Annie  <--- Gets ahold of herself.

   I would shrug, go to the character select screen on FV, roll up
another cleric, probably a dark elf this time, and hope that I get the
same name my main has now.  Then I would log off, for about a week, to
give the newbie areas about a week to clear out.  I would of course be
visiting my guild's website, especially since I run the thing, and try
to organize the reformation.

   Oh, I would also read all the bitching here about the "tragedy". 
Probably giggle a bit.

Annie  <--- Resilient, that way.
