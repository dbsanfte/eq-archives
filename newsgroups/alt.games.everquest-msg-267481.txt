FFXI Online has among the least PC-like user interface ever, though,
since it's designed to work well on PS2 controllers.  Or have they
changed that recently?  I never managed to get comfortable with the
UI, and that's one of the reasons I gave up on the game, the other
being I never got into the FFXI world like I did Norrath.
