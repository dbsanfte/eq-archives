They recently "corrected" THE ENTIRE MEZ LINE, including the top level
spell in that line, Glamour of Kintaz...they lowered the mana cost BY MORE
THAN HALF. Then they raised its effectiveness.

Enchanters are the undisputed masters of such unimportant skills as:
Jewelcraft, Mana Regen, Int/Wis buffs, Mana buffs, Mez, Charm, Haste, MR
debuffing. Then there are the other things that they are only "really good
at, but not quite the best" like slows....

Boo-fucking-hoo...poor enchanters.
