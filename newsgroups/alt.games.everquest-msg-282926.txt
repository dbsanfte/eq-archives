Worker's Sledgemallet.

Or a neutral character.

1) Get to amiable faction with Venril Sathir.  This is not trivial, but not
impossible as long as you've never fought in Karnor's or Howling Stones.
You'll be sick of Sarnak Braids, but you'll get there.

2) Give a jade (purchasable from vendors for a few silver) to the Undead
Foreman in the evil outpost in Overthere.

>Pretty easy for good too, you just have to charm the foreman. 

Trivial for a high-level Bard, Enchanter, or Necro.  Though he's pretty
resistant, so expect to take a beating while you retry the charm.  It's not
risky by today's standards, but pre-PoP I needed help (a shaman for malo and
healing) to do it. 

Less trivial for anyone else.  You have to do the charm yourself, as other
people's pets are only indifferent.  There are charm items in the game (Puppet
Strings, probably others), but they're not cheap nor easy to get, and with the
high resist rate it's possible you'll need multiple tries.  

If you're a class that can't charm and you're in a situation where you can't
get to amiable with VS (due to religion or past actions), you're probably
better off with other transportation methods.
