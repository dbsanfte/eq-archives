Basically VI couldn't figure out a way to keep people interested in
"leveling" (something they probably regret with Velious) while still
not introducing new "levels" (which will cause a buttload of people to
just quit from the sheer tedium and totally fuck up what little
balance there is left in the game).  So they introduced these AA
skills.

A very few skills are extremely useful.  Most aren't worth the time to
read up on.  A couple, if they do what I *think* they do, is either
WAY over powered or there's some set of mobs in the game that's gonna
make AoW look like a gimp.
