Ding! He is 76 but I can't remember any level where I have dinged, died, 
deleveled, dinged on a rez, sooo many times. I've been doing a lot of poking 
around solo and not always carefully enough. Oh well... It's the journey to 
the Guild Lobby, not the destination.... or something like that.

He does well when I am focused but late at night I am often lacking in the 
focused dept. On a bright note, I have yet to pay the post 75 summoning 
stone price yet but I am sure that's coming.

I'll do the Alla spell search, 75 and up, etc. and go get the next couple 
levels anyway. I have yet to even zone into anywhere in SoF so that should 
be fun, just to have a look.

Thanks for heads up about vov.
