You are probably right about being dead weight there, but, with the new 
xp system, so long as you could contribute just a little bit to killing 
mobs a tad faster, you earn your keep.  Even if you do nothing at all, 
you don't cost anyone much, if any, xp as the 6th group member.  Sure, 
they could have done better with another necro or some other class.
