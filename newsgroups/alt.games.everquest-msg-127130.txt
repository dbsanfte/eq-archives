My monk has hit level 33 and is currently grinding away in the OverThere.
Making rather decent money there like 20-30pp in a three hour play session
or so.  Currently in the bank I have almost 400pp.  My current equipment is
mostly Wu's Stuff and two CoT's as weapons.  I'm looking to upgrade and
wondering what I should start looking for in auctions.  At 35 I plan on
going to Rathe Mountains and fighting giants there so my money should start
climbing a little faster and around 35 I'd like to get a hold of a Wu's
Trance Stick (starts proccing Smite at 35).  But aside from that what should
I be looking for?  Or should I just wait till the days of Rathe and start
saving for Black Panther Skin?  Any advice or suggestions would be
appreciated.  This is the first character I have taken this high in levels
so I don't know all the armor yet.
