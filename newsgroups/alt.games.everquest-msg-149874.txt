I am running a Celeron 350Mhz with lots o'memory and Win98. Tragically
enough, it is a Sony VAIO.

If someone sends text in front of a link I see the numbers and the
name instead of a link. Text behind a link I see a link and the text
behind like they intended.

Haven't seen any reports with this from VI!
