Sorry Jt.  You fail as a troll when you cut out the part where you call 
you a troll.  When you're trolling and the person not only responds point 
by point negating every stupid arguement you bring up, AND calls you a 
troll, you lose.  You are too stupid to troll.  You might as well go play 
in the sandbox, it's a bit more your speed.  You might be able to actually 
hold your own against a 4-year old.
