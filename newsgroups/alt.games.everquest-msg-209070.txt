No, but I would say you are wrong to have made an issue of it.  Character
creation stats offer something ridiculously miniscule like 1% difference to
your character at higher levels (or 0-5% for a wider selection of people)

No

No.

A ranger is a damage dealer. Concentrate on offensive abilities.
Combat Fury 3, for starters. Then EQ/AM3, or Fury of Ages, ambidex,
ferocity.  I'd do all of those on a DPS char before working on
hp/mitigation/avoidance (btw Combat Agility+Lightening Reflexes is WAY
better than Combat Stability+Innate Defence, when you reach the point of
working on those)
