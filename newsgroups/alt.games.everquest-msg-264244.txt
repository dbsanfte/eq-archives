Just to clarify, I wasn't having a go, which is why I added the 'lol' to 
the start of the sentence. Also thought it might help him to see other 
people's reactions to the post in the other thread.

This is why I enjoyed her opinions, because she set out what type of 
gaming expectations her opinions were based on, so that I could say to 
myself "Well she and I have similar expectations in this area, but 
elsewhere we differ slightly".

He did state somewhere along the way that he gave up on the game, but 
his wife was still in the Beta and has a much higher opinion of it, so 
it's understandable that he would have out-dated information. I was 
recently in on the 'Counter-Strike : Source' Beta (the phase available 
to owners of 'Condition Zero'), but for many reasons only played it for 
the first two weeks. When I gained access to the final, completed 
version, I found that a lot of my opinions were also out-dated as a lot 
had been changed and fixed since my first two weeks of Beta.

I would prefer a happy medium between the two for the game throughout, 
to be honest. As I said, I cringe at 'hand-holding' gameplay, and what 
appeals to me during my time in EverQuest is the freedom that I am 
given. Obviously there are zones which are out of bounds to me purely on 
the basis that the creatures there would have my character for 
breakfast, but there are no physical barriers keeping me from exploring 
these areas. Some developers have said that in EverQuest 2, the 
hand-holding is in an attempt to help us grow steadily, to learn the 
right lessons at the right times so we are fully prepared for what lies 
ahead. However my thoughts are that making the mistake of, for example, 
trying to get to High Hold while still being unable to slay the snakes 
that hang around the gates of Qeynos is just an important learning 
process, as it teaches me my limitations while at the same time showing 
me that these areas out in the wilderness are there for me whenever I 
feel the urge to explore them.

Apologies for the long-winded nature of that sentence...I understand I'm 
being incredibly specific and that there are a vast amount of areas 
where the game excells, but this is just to give an example of my 
expectations for an MMORPG.
