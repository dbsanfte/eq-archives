I'm not endorsing it, and I think the theory's of dubious merit, but
I've heard some people do this, usually the people who /auction
frequently as well as setting up an afk trader.

They overprice some common item outrageously so that people can find
them easier with the /baz search.

"Want to find me?  Look for spider silks:  I'm the one selling them
for 10,000 each!"

They use it as a benchmark so you can find them on the search feature,
which allows you to find them in the bazaar, and find their other
items that you're really interested in buying.
