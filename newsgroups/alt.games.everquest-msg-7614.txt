Obviously he did research, unfortunately his research was wrong.  Anyone
willing to do research is willing to post their sources.  

Obviously he has sources, but they were mis-informed, it did take more
than a simple search to find sources, as there was nothing found with
Meth and pilots. So Shaddup.

The "I'm right but I won't prove it" doesn't fly.
