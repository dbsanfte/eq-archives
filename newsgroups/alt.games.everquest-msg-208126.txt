What difference would that make, all they need to do is assume that the 
address I use here is a valid one, and that if I post here using it, I 
am interested in EQ.

Now a lot of people post to this newsgroup (and other newsgroups for 
that matter) with dummy email addresses, which would protect them from 
such scams from this source.

But the beauty of using Email for scams or just spam in general is that 
it costs next to nothing to -try-.

In fact, they even send out emails to addresses which are generated by 
combining words out of a dictionary with real email server names, 
perhaps one in a hundred of those is a real address but since it hardly 
cost a thing to send to that hundred just to get one hit, it makes sense 
to them to do so.

I've recieved other spam and even things that looked suspiciously like 
virus carriers before, this one was interesting to me because its the 
first one I've seen that specifically mentioned EQ.  Its also the first 
one that I posted about here, again because it was the first to be EQ 
related, I assume source of my address to be here and that everyone else 
using a real address here would also be a potential target.
