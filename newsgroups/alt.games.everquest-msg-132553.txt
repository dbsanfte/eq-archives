Very accurate assessment.  Although by kindergarten both my kids were well
aware that sperm and egg combined to make a baby.  DS went along to all my
gyn appointments, heard his sister's heartbeat, saw the ultrasound, and was
even in the hospital for part of my labor when he was 2 1/2.  Conception,
childbirth, even sex itself, are biological functions.  I see nothing wrong
with honestly answering a child's questions about biological functions on a
level that they can understand.

DD's kindergarten teacher told me a funny story along these lines.  The
district we were in required all students to undergo a "sex abuse prevention
program".  In kindergarten the instructor would talk about the kids "private
parts" and tell them that it wasn't ok to have someone touch your "private
parts" which were defined as "where your bathing suit covers".  After
hearing her talk about "private parts" a few times DD raised her hand and
asked if the woman was referring to the penis and vagina.  The teacher said
that she'd never seen this person turn red before. I was very proud of her
for asking for specific information rather than goobelgygook.
