I did this run at right about this level. Bind right after you zone in, the
lost valley is fairly safe. Sow, Lev and Camo. Go through the tunnel and
hang a left. Stay high on the wall of the zone and follow it around. Right
after things turn from Snow to Green you will hit the lane to the BW zone.
As you move across the lane stay by the wall but stay at ground level. Just
a bit farther on you will see some ruins and the tunnel to FM. After you are
through the tunnel to FM turn right and follow the zone wall around to the
OT zone. The LoIO zone is between FM and OT and you can duck in their if you
pick up any agro. Good luck.

Of course the first 2 times I tried this in wolf form, so I had a corpse
recovery on the way also.

Also remember that, because you can't always be sure where Burnt Woods zone
is this week, you don't really want to zone in there. :)
