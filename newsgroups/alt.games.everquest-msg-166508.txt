Actually not. It seems to be just a case of we have a random name
generator that kind of works and we are not losing players because of
the minor inconvenience of the random name generator rejecting its own
names.

Speed would not be an issue as generating a random name can be run in
a low priority thread. If this still generates too much traffic then
run it on a different server.

Checking the name list for the uniqueness of the name is pretty quick
if you have a proper index. Its not as if there are a billion names on
each server. The slowest operation would be to remove a name from the
index but this is not necessary.

An even better solution would be to generate a list of say 1000 names
that does not exist on the server. As people request random names you
just step through the list. You also schedule a little housekeeping
job to run every 24 hours to fill the list up to 1000 again. This way
you have instant random name that will be accepted by server available
every time you click get me a name. The only case this won't work in
is where you select a random name and someone else enters the same
name or gets it from the random generator as well. Once you click
accept the one that gets through first will get the name the other one
will need to pick something else. This won't happen very often and the
few instances this will inconvenience the customer can be pretty much
ignored.

There definitely are viable solutions. I think it is just a case of it
is not good business to invest in the improvement of a working
solution (even if clumsy) that has no direct financial benefit to the
company.
