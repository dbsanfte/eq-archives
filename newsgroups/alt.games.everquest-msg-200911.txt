KEI normally goes for about 50pp on my server, with the
majority of the sellers asking for that rather than donations.
I just find the assumption that "noobs" will buy KEI
laughable;  I certainly couldn't have afforded KEI at that
level when I started.   Anyone who can routinely afford
it is going to be leveling slowly or have a main with which
they learned the majority of the low-level game anyway.

As I've pointed out, it's the same old argument used to
argue against twinks and power-leveled characters.  "Sure,
they'll be level 60 soon, but they won't know how to
play their class!"  Sure, there's the occasional moron
for which that's true.   But -- and this is my own
observation -- the people for which that is true are
morons even on their mains with 120 days /played...
