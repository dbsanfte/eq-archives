Forgive me, my link to WoW was a bit over-emphatic, looking back at
what I wrote - I WAS in full rant though  :D

Mind you, I DO think anyone that needs to pay for someone else to log
on to their account and powerlevel their character for money DOES have
the brain and talent of an amoeba - no matter what the game.  The
people who get there under their own steam deserve all due credit.
