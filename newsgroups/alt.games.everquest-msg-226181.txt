I've seen this suggested before, but its always confused me.

Lets see, I have 501 hp and 500 hp in gear.  Normally, geared, I can 
bind wounds to 500, which is 50%.  Take off the 500 hp in gear, (leaving 
me at 1 hp), bind wounds up to 250, then put gear back on and I'm at 750?

Looks like this would work, and be worthwhile if you have substantial 
amounts of HP gear and no healer at all.

I recently replaced a 40 hp item with a 9 sta item on my mage.  Guess 
how many hp I lost on that deal?  One.  Since its really a 10 sta item 
but I'm below the reccomended level, I expect I'll end up ahead on the deal.

Note, we are talking a gnome mage with a sta fully geared up under 100 
(I think its currently at 96), level 52 or so when I did this.

I suspect that HP per sta are level based, so that at low levels you 
might need 100 sta for 40 hp as you suggest, but like INT, as you level 
up the return on the stat gets bigger.

If this is true, I'll end up getting even more HP back on my swap, with 
my sta going up and my hp per sta also going up, while the 40 hp item 
was always going to be a 40 hp item.
