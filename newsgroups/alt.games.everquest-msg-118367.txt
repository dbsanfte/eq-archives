My Rogue just got pick pockets,What is the best way to go about advancing? I
have a feeling its what I've been doing...get killed a bunch then go up one
point with nothing to show for it.Also any tips, I noticed after a couple
failed attempts they knew my name...what does that mean? Will they forget me
or will they always be touchy with me?
