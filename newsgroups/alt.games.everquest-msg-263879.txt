I would say that he means a 'making sense' Iksar.  It doesn't quite
make sense than a race doesn't automatically have access to its racial
abilities.  It seems like like those are the sort of things you either

I'm not quite sure how or why you would have to bash 50,000,000 rats
before it suddenly and mysteriously activates.
