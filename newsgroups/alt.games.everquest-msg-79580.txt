To add to this, I have spoken to one of my friends, who I believed to have
pointed out where the term/name came from...he denies all knowledge but said
"it's a nice story, hey run with it" cheers Mike, anyway now I'm left
wandering what I was smoking back then...
My friend says as far as he was aware they coined the term Drow by reversing
Word, ok so now this is getting silly.
So now I start digging for your explaination (rather be proved wrong than
nothing proved at all) I find somewhere that the term Drow is the from a
scot. var. of Trow (according to webster 2nd edition, apparently)  So I look
into Trow.

Trow or Trowis seems to be some kind of mischevious spirit form the Orkney
islands (described as stunted and ugly) but this term itself is suggester to
have come from word lost to the language, Drow, this intern seems to stem
from a norse word Draugr which would be a spirit or ghost, usually it is to
describe the undead occupent of a cairn.
So that word seems to exist in the Scottish folklore (somewhere) but I don't
see it used to describe evil elves so whether this term was coined from here
I cannot say but certainly you're explaination is now holding far more water
than mine.
Still, I need to look into my story, which I will probably find was some
tabletop myth (like an urban myth but for geeks)
Bah...now I have to prove my story...Yes I have got work to do but this is
far more important
