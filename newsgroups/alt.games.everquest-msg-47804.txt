UPDATE:

I got it  to work, I get  some strange pops and other  weird sounds at
times, but at least I am getting environment sound.

I set  soundcard hardware acceleration  one notch down from  FULL, and
that stops me from locking up on exit, and gives me the sound effects.

I do loose some EAX stuff this way I believe though.
