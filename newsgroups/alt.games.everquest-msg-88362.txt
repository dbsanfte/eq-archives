Warrior, Cleric, Druid, Enchanter
Warrior, Cleric, Druid, Necro
Warrior, Cleric, Druid, Bard

Warrior, Cleric, Shaman, Ranger
Warrior, Cleric, Shaman, Shadow Knight
Warrior, Cleric, Shaman, Necro

Warrior, Cleric, Wizard, Bard
Warrior, Cleric, Wizard, Necro

etc.

Basically start with a Warrior and Cleric and two other classes. The
more diverse the 3rd and 4ths skills, the better you are.
