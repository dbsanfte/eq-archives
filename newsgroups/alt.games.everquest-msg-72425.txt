Free binds, horses, and better customer service have nothing to do with
Verant mellowing out and everything to do with a knee-jerk response to the
DAoC feature set, IMO. In Verant terms, "Never, even if Hell freezees over"
with regard to a requested feature actually means, "Never, while our players
have nowhere else to go and we have them by the short and curlies, no matter
how much they beg or plead; but pronto, once our competitors offer the
feature in question." Just wait till DAoC gets player housing (recently
implemented in AC) and watch Verant scramble to follow suit.
