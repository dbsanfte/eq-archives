I've never really had 'bad' experiences with it... just mezzing myself gets
real annoying... so I tend to stick to single mezzes cuz I control them alot
easier imo... and most times I can stop 4-5 mob trains with AoE and a decent
cleric backing me up...

and for that matter... I end up as main puller most of the time so i
normally get to chose if I pull a train or not hehe and if I DO get an
add... I can stop it before it even gets to the group...

:)
