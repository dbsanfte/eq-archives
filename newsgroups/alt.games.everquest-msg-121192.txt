According to CR, they are looking at casting NPCs case-by-case and
determing where their melee skills should be now. Some higher end NPCs
SHOULD be able to melee good as well as cast smartly.

All that aside, my biggest problem with NPC casters: Damn near fucking
impossible to interrupt their spells usually. A mob SNEEZES on me and
my casting is interrupted. 3 hits for 20+ and a kick between start and
finish casting, and the mob still gets the spell off without even a
"regains his concentration" message. :-/
