You are, indeed, beating your head against a tree.

Forget getting to 100, thats relatively trivial.  When your skill gets up
around (  I forget, 156?   When the last piece of kitchen ware goes
trivial )  things suddenly get more expensive, and then when the
last piece of banded goes trivial things get -massively- more expensive.

I smithed quite happily with a high elf cleric, whose wisdom was
200 and intelligence (without trying) was over 150.  Took about
a hundred pp to get to 100 skill, and about 2000pp more to
get to where FS plate was the only thing left to raise skill with
(Ornate chain not yet in the game at that point)

Then I tried to do the same with a dwarven cleric, who's wisdom
hovered around 150 and intelligence down in the 60 to 70 range,
cost me over 500pp to get to 100 and when I hit the no more
kitchenware wall I realized it would take 10K more to get to doing
cultural!

Here's how it seems to work: successes are dependant on your
wisdom (important for conserving cash while learning, and for
making money at any level) while learning is based on intelligence.
Supposedly strength also helps with successes, but I have
no evidence of that one way or the other, certainly a str of 150
didn't seem any better for my dwarf (wis 150) than my str of
75 (wis 200) with my cleric.

If you have high 50s twinkage worth of cash to blow on the
project then you -can- do it without the stats, but even then
you'd be better off blowing some of that money on getting
stat gear.

More sensible is to make an alt who has the best stats you can
get to make it to your goal.  About that goal, though, you need
to decide what you want.  If its money, then you might look
at a high elf smith, who can recoup all his costs getting to FS
smithing levels by selling just a couple full suits.  Important here is
charisma (so you pay less per stuff, and when leveling up, sell
to vendors for more).  If, on the other hand, its to make
cultural armor for your main, you need to make sure that the
smith race you pick can make cultural you can use.  You don't
say which race your bard is, so you'll have to do the research.

If you think Freeport is a pain to smith in, you may not be cut
out for the endeavor.  There is no city (well, maybe Thurgadin) where
its easier, and once you get past banded, you'll be force to -really- travel,
the most convenient system being to buy metal in HHK and molds in
Freeport... unless you wanted small or large molds!

Gate helps a lot if you are a smith, and if you are making a smithing
twink you should probably pick a caster or healer for the purpose,
since thats going to give you best int/wis anyway.
