Isn't Lords a glorified video game?

Why would players of a game that has little to do with the core game,
Everquest, be invited to beta test the newest version?  Wouldn't you want
die-hard experienced players who know the in's and out's of grouping,
leveling, questing, etc?  or maybe to invite members of a well-established
guild??

I understand they need a few newbies to cover the 'monkey tests' - but
newbies aren't gonna really stretch the game...
