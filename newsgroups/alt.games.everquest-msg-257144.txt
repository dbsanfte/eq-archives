I've heard of this too, several months ago.  It occured before I started EQ,
so I wasn't aware of any uproar.  I'd have to agree that the person who did
this was a bit too immature.  EQ's a game.  Granted I probably spend more
time in it than I should, the moment it becomes more than entertainment is
when it's time to move on. :)  Apparently the person who pulled this little
hoax off didn't realize that.
