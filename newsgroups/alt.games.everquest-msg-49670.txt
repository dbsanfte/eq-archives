Only if everyone on a server/module wants it to be. For those who don't
give two squirts of stale urine about role playing, there will be plenty of
hack and slash for them.

The stated limit is what, 64 people? Something like that. I bet it would
take a really beefy machine to handle that many people (and the necesary
world space to keep all of them occupied), so servers with populations that
large will be fairly rare. 4-10 more likely.

I have great hopes for it...
