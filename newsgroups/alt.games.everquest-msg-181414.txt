I have one of the oldest living computers in the world, and I'm able to run
luclin to a degree - I can even bolt around the bazaar with very slight
chopping.

Pentium 2, 333mhz  192 ram and a 128meg radeon card.

No animations and no new models - level of detail is off.

when you enter a luclin zone, Kill your clipping plane and set the sky to OFF -
- then, slowly raise the clip plane until you find a happy meduim of sights and
performance.

Granted, I've only been in Dawnshroup Peaks, mons seru (or whatever it's
called) netherbain lair, and a few oter zones.  BUT, I can run through the PoK
pretty easily.  Oddly enough - I still can't wander through emerald jungle or
burning woods...

good luck
