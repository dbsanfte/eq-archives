Really?  How's sharing a cite to a *new* story on it by a
national media outlet "very old news.?"

It could be, you know, that someone is pointing out that CNN
covered the story rather than pointing out the original events.
It's generally considered newsworthy to point out that a story
(especially one without obvious, national importance) has been
picked-up by national media...
