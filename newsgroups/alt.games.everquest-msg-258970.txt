    I've read the LoTR several times when I was in high school, and am
reading it again.  I'll specifically look to see if at any point anyone
tells Frodo "Yo, nigga, that phat bling-bling you carry is so ghey!"  I
wouldn't have know what any of that meant the twenty or so years ago that I
read it, so I  might have missed it.
