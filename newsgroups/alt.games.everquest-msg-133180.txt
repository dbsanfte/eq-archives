Answering EQ here.  I admit I haven't followed this whole thread, but, as I
understand it, the South African version of Sesame Street is going to add an
HIV+ muppet in an attempt to teach kids tolerance for someone who is HIV+.
The intent is not to teach them all about the gritty details of STDs.

I don't think that Sesame Street is the right place to teach about STDs as
such, but it is an excellent place to teach a little tolerance, along with
the alphabet, and getting along with one another.
