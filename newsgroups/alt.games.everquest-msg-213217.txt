Reading that post, but relatively innocent of how the internet itself works, I
wondered if it would be possible to have your ISP unblock that port.  I mean, it
looked like the ISPs the people were using were the ones doing the blocking, and
I can't think why they should be randomly blocking out ports just for the fun of
it.  Perhaps I'm way off base about that though, what those IT people do inside
their Shroedinger's cat black boxes is probably something I not only don't want
to know, but due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, can't know.
