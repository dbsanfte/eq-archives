Update:

We took heavy casualties but took Trak down. Tactics consisted of
sending a first wave (3 people) with runes to trigger the first AoE.
Second wave was the melees and healers to engage the dragon. Third
wave was the nukers when Trak was down low enough.

I think the poison AoE accounted for many of the deaths. Three of our
people got banished. Trak dropped the shaman and ranger breastplates
and a bunch of teeth for the VP key quest. 

Oddly enough I took no damage from the AoE. PR was 205.

Our next target is "Lord Bob". Think he's a mob in Velks but I know
nothing about him.
