How long ago might that have been?  I've only played a bard for about 1 1/2
years, and only played a couple other characters for a scant few months
before that.  If it was done before that point then I wouldn't know the
difference.
If it *was* done before then, and my current experience is all I have to
compare to, then I think I would have been far too frustrated by the bard
experience to continue.  Then again, I've held the same job for 12 years, so
I'm obviously a glutton for punishment-making my point moot at best, hehe.

Sean...
