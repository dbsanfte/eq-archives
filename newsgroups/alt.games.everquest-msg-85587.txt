Nope, dont have to admit that at all.  I have never had a bad experience
in dealing with CS, be it Guide, GM or phone support.  They have
recovered lost exp on confirmed bug deaths, caught grief players red
handed and removed them from the game among other things over the
years.  They are hard working people who try to make the game fun for
everyone has been my experience.  Was I disappointed to find out that
they couldn't replace my quest items when I tried to combine what I
thought was 10 pages of a tome and was really 9 and one page of a poem
and I lost them all?  You bet, but you know what, it was my mistake, not
a bug and I understood why that was the way it was.  So no, I don't
agree with you on this at all.

Money is no object, my fleet of jets that I use to ferry in the steady
stream of models that help me run my multi billion dollar conglomerate
can just skip the detailing one day a week and I can cover it easily
<EG>, but I still ain't playing on a legends server cause I am happy
where I am.
