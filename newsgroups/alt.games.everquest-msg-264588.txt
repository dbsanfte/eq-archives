Shoulda re-petitioned to get a different GM. Someone following you
around and KSing WILL be considered harassment. Hell, go to their
website and email support through there, filing a complaint regarding
the GM who responded. Assuming, of course, you explained to the GM who
responded that the person you were complaining about was actively
following you around and stealing your kills and it wasn't just a
random incident.

KSing in itself isn't against the rules in CoH, however, harassment
is.
