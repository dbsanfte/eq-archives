This probably isn't average, but my 35 druid is maxed in
1HB and 2HB (144) as well as offense and defense (175). 

Yes, I melee a lot (solo). Love them damage shields. My typical
fight goes like this: thorns up, snare, nuke once, DoT, melee.
Sometimes I'll get beat down to the point of backing off, but 
by then the mob is usually within one or two nukes of dropping.

An added bonus of this strategy is that all casting skills 
except Divination are worked each fight: thorns-Abj, snare-Alt,
nuke-Evoc, DoT-Conj.

This strategy won't work forever, but I'm going to milk it while
it lasts. A big goal of mine is for offense and defense to hit 200 
before I finish level 40. Whether it's possible given how slowly
*any* skills rise in the 190s, I don't know, but so far so good.
