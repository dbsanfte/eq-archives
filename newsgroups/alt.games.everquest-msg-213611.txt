No it wouldn't.
1.  Mid 50's can't reliably resist those AEs even if they some how
magically got their resists into the 500's (my twinkie toon is level
55, he managed to get all his resists into the high 300's, he resisted
about 1/3 of the AEs--and that's gimp mob AEs, not the really nasty
ones like Aary's).
2.  Almost every gear out of PoP that would help in these encounters
has required levels and it's higher than mid 50's.  Those gear which
only have "recommended" levels become crap when equipped by a lower
level toon.

So unless you're talking about Luclin boss mob gear (which are no drop
and requires you to kill mobs significantly tougher than ToVN mobs),
it isn't happening.

Most are.
There are a couple which you need higher DPS than what one group would
provide unless all those are decked out in PoTime weapons.

What's droppable from ToVN?
I think only the mithiral boots/helm are droppable and those are crap
by PoP standards.

The Blackstar is decent, and other than Vulak loots and some of the
effect items (which most are of utilitiarian value such as the
Dreadgazer amulet for a night blind human monk), I honestly can't
think of an item I would actually use from that zone anymore.

What level was your enchanter and what level charm did they use?

Regardless, unless those chickens were killed in a very strange way,
the generally spawn in nice clusters.  Usually 2 to 3 at a time.
Keeping those charmed while your melee's are -300 ATK debuffed trying
to kill Aary isn't an easy task.

I can certainly see handling one, two or even three chickens that pop
when you're killing Aary, but I'm betting it was with more than 24
people and they were also higher leveled than mid 50's.
