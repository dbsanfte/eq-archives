We had a 49 Druid in there doing fine at guards, so I don't see why not.
But of course, you'll need to be in a good (preferably full) group.
You're not soloing shit in there at 51. The first two guards on the
steps will likely take your lunch money and make you cry if you try.
However, on most servers it seems to be a pretty crowded zone, and
shaman buffs are always a plus so you could go in alone, stand at the
entry and advertise looking for group. Just be sure to securely bind
yourself *outside* the zone in a safe area. If you don't find a group,
you're not getting out alive without gating.
