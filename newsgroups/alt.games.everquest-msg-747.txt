ACK yes, stop...

Practice runes are made in the concordance of research, not your grimoire.
(Concordance has 6 slots)

You will need to put a parchment and quill in with the other items, you will
usually get the quill back.

The grimoire is used to combine the completed azia and beza runes to make a
completed practic rune.  AFAIK this is only good for selling to a merchant.

I found that the most productive method is to empty your sacks/backpacks,
and go off to fill them with the stackable components, then return to the
bank, balance your inventory, and go to the guild to make runes...(parchment
is non-stackable)

I found that some items are easier hunted than bought in quantity, and some
the reverse applies...I hunted my bone chips and zombie skins in South
Karana, at the pyramid south of the centaur village.  This turned out to be
the most profitable time I've spent in-game, as many of the mobs drop rusty,
which you can sell at the centaur village, and while running through
Highpass when I was through, sold 54 bone chips to a necro for 35 plat.  Got
home to Felwithe, maxed my skill (35 at the time) and banked about 50 zombie
skins for later.

Got spiderling silks by sicc'ing the pet on spiderlings in East Commons.
(another non-stackable item)

I guess what I'm getting at is that you should plan your research activities
to minimize criss-crossing all of Norrath chasing items.  I try to keep boat
trips and runs through Kithicor at an absolute minimum...

When first-level runes triv, go straight to third-level....bixie wings
apparently don't exist, and you'll be able to do thirds.  (I had my skill
level advance even when the combination attempts failed, fo figure)

Best of luck,

Jeenious
