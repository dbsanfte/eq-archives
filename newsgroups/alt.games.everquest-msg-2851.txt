A new MMOPRG starting up has an interesting FAQ and new and wonderful
ways of addressing PK and L33t D00dz. A quote from them in response to
their naming policy:

'Also, if someone wishes to name himself "l33t d3wd," well, that'd be
the equivalent of him painting a big red sign on himself that reads,
"I'm not someone you want to associate with." - So who are we to not
grant him that right? '

Also on PK and PvP:
'To address grief PKing, we've added some interesting mechanics into
the mix: Players have the option of reporting a player for
non-consensual PvP. If a player is reported three times, his name
turns red identifying him as a PKer. The next time he dies (by a
monster or player), he spends 30 minutes of in-game time in a jail
cell where is able to do absolutely nothing, not even communicate. The
player must be in-game (and not idle) for the timer to tick. The
player who initiates the attack does not have the option of reporting
the individual who was able to defend himself. '

Woo Hoo! a PK and PvP system with some promise!
