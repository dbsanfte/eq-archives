While someone who suffers from an addictive personality can become
addicted to nearly anything, some things ARE naturally more addictive
than others.  For example, an addictive personality is more likely to
become addicted to playing EverQuest than flying kites.

Sounds good.

Well, EverQuest *does* have features which are known to appeal to
people with addictive personalities, such as its randomized reward
mechanic.  (One of the same features that making gambling addictive.)

I don't recall the study, but I think it was found that people (and
many animals) prefer randomized rewards over predictable rewards.  For
example, they prefer to randomly get between 1 and 10 gold pieces per
kill, rather than exactly 5 gold pieces and 5 silver pieces per kill.

It averages out the same, but people get strangely "addicted" to the
randomized reward.  They keep playing and keep playing, becaues the
randomized reward is so...well, oddly "rewarding".  I think some actual
chemical changes happen in the brain that gives them pleasure when
they get the randomized reward, and it's very consistent.  They keep
playing so they'll keep getting that reward.

In contrast, people get bored quick of getting the same, predictable
reward each time.

I think that's one of EQ's addicting elements: you never know when
you'll get that skillup, you never know how much plat you'll get off
that hill giant, you never know how many spiderling silks will drop,
you never know when that rare will drop.  Randomized rewards.  Which
are addictive, for some reason.

I apologize if I trivialized the more serious addictions that you have
first hand experience with, it was never my intention, I swear it.
