OF COURSE I CAN!  It's those damn wooden shoes!  And what's with the wings
on the hats that their women-folk wear?  Do they think they can fly?  Is it
to make others think that their heads are bigger than they are (and,
therefore, with bigger brains)?  That's it!  Those Dutch are always trying
to make me feel inferior!  I can't stand them!

I feel terrible about me, though.  I part English and part Irish.  That's
why I tried to place a bomb in my own car.
