Well there's good news and bad news.

The spell Assail of Innoruuk decreases all resistances by 100 with the mr
debuff in slot one.

The bad news is that it's a mob spell (probably Innoruuk himself but the
LUCY site doesn't say). I guess the point of slot 1 is that it overwrites
the likeliest mr buffs.
