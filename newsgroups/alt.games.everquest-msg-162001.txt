(top post fixed)

quoted from http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/sz_rule_sets.jsp

1. Player v. Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that
are not on the same team, regardless of level. A level 50 character
can attack and kill a level 6 character if that character is not a
member of his alliance. But rules 2 and 3 apply.

Do try and read the whole post before replying.  It states in the very
second sentence that he is not on Vallon Zek, but on Sullon Zek.  It
is impossible u read it?

Bye
