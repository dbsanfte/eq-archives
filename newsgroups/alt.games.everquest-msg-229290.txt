I duo'd my 62 mage and cleric in nurga, and I got the cleric from low 40s 
to 52 or so in about a week.

I've never played a necro to high lvl but I'd assume that an upper 60 necro 
pet could tank close to the same. The only problem would be getting around 
in there since you can't invis or coh down.
