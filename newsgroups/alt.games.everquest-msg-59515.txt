If that's what you've seen, there are two possibilities:

1. You are one of those griefers, so of course 99.999% of RvR combat
you see looks like that, or

2. You are one of those weak players, in which case you are an idiot
for going to the frontier unprepared.  "Prepared" means going with a
group that has the proper classes to deal with the frontier (in
particular, if the group is going to have lower level people, make
sure you've got people to find and eliminate stealthed archers so they
won't be slaughtering the lower level people).

RvR in DAoC is not supposed to be mideval fantasy Quake.  You don't do
it solo (unless you are a stealth class, in which case you can do the
role of sniper solo if you are a class that gets to train archery, or
you can take the job of finding and removing snipers if you are one of
the non-archer stealth classes).
