    How long have you played, again? It must be doing something right.

    And linear progression games need not be completely linear to work.
Think of Velious progression as an example. Do one of (acquire PoG gear or
quest Thurg armour), then do one of (quest Skyshrine armour or quest Kael
armour), then do one of (kill in NToV or kill in Sleeper's). Guilds were
free to mix and match between the choices, but both options would lead to
about the same endpoint in progression and there was a cost to taking one
path over another. It was fun and it left room for plenty of people to be
engaged with the content at the same time while preserving the order of
progress.

    PoP ZEM's only made 90% of the world obsolete because nobody cared about
items thanks to The Bazaar. If people still had to go out and get stuff, and
not just plat, to be able to handle PoP mobs, then you'd have people in
camps in Chardok, in Kael, in Umbral Plains, in Cazic Thule, and in all the
other places where items drop frequently. PoP has relatively poor item
drops, except in certain anomalous places (CoD), and couldn't have geared
people up properly on its own.

    Raiding is item camping, and is quite popular. When I was levelling up
back in the old days, you always went to where the good stuff dropped if you
could. Now, you go to The Bazaar for stuff and go where the XP is good. You
don't care about what drops, because it's worse than what you bought for the
most part. You reduce the game from "hunting for the rare foozles, guarded
by critters of doom", where it matters what zone you're in, to "XP/unit time
> all". Don't you enjoy hunting in places where if that rare item drops, it
goes on your character and improves you rather than being stuffed in a pack
to be sold by Ventmule overnight?

    So what would you suggest to replace it, that would keep a loyal
customer base long-term and would keep development costs minimized? This is
a business, after all.

    You're missing what I mean by "mid-end". I'm not talking about non-uber
folks that are level 60+ as "mid-end". I'm taking about level 30's and 40's,
levels that even for casual gamers get left behind fairly quickly. This is
the point where the game starts to get difficult (well, time consuming for
the same amount of progress), and players get discouraged. This is exactly
when they need to be able to do exciting things to make them want to spend
the time to progress. How exciting is it killing the same Sambatas in
Dawnshroud all day, every day, getting nothing from it but XP, coin, and
acrylia to sell in The Bazaar? Or killing the junk in Overthere, or
Dreadlands, mobs with coin, sellables, and scant else? This is where you're
going to lose people, when XP grinding becomes exactly that - grinding.

    And progressing your character is *fun*. It's cool to get that neat new
toy that lets you kill faster, or kill bigger things, or survive what you
never could have survived before.

    If you have a better theory on why folks enjoy EQ, I'd love to hear it.
You rarely respond to any such request, though, so I doubt I'll see anything
responding to this point. Your philosophy courses taught you well about
never being put on the defensive, too bad they didn't teach you to do
anything constructive.
