Awesome. Great job, Dan.

I get a little bit of that "priceless" feeling myself getting drunk in 
Clurg's bar in Oggok, and have Ogre newbies wonder how that silly
Human got there. Then again, getting faction in Oggok is *trivial* compared 
to what you did in Cabilis, especially if you have the benefit of the Wolf 
Form leg-up/cheat. I may try the same thing in Grobb if I feel particularly 
bored one of these days.

One question... Did you get all your faction hits with actuall kills, or 
did you help yourself along by buffing/healing other players in Kurns, or 
just putting the boot into whatever they were fighting? (figuratively 
speaking, I know Paladins don't get kick :)
