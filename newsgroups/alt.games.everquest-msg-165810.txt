This is happening for a very good reason. Once a character with a specific
name is deleted you are no longer able to make another character with the
same name for the sake of account security.

A level 60 warrior with 140 days played time on tribunal named ridax (me).
Well one day someone hacked my account logged on my warrior and deleted him
fully equipped. But they didn't stop here. They kept on making another ridax
and deleting him over and over again. I don't know how long this went on for
but by the time I asked for a char restore the GM team were unable to
restore my character. Because the new ridax(s) that were made had completely
overwritten the original ridax's backups. I could not even get a naked
restore.

So really, this new feature is for your own good. Because had they had been
doing this earlier I would not of had to start over again.
