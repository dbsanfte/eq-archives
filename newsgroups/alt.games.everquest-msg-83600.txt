Depends how much cash you have, sell on Tarew Marr (IF you're lucky enough
to actually FIND one for sale) for 18k or so, more if the druid/ranger is
desperate.

The Reavers themselves are near 100% MR, so you essentially need to get a
bunch of melees, clerics, and at least one rogue (to open door to reavers)
and you stand back and cower in the corner, maybe a Ro's Fiery Sundering,
and if it lands try Fixation, but other than that you're kinda useless
except for a backup healer.   (I have heard of wizards landing Lures, but
that's about it, I say Ro's because it has lure resist on it, then Fixation
because you can cast it and it's off fire resist that Ro's lowers)

And a few things to note, First, NO AOE OFFENSE SPELLS, they cause Bad
Things (tm) due to the funky Z axis in CoM and stuff on the second floor.
Second, be prepared for the fact that once you kill a Reaver, another one
has a chance to pop up from the corpse, so from one Reaver pull, you might
end up fighting 4 or 5 in a row, also a chance for Lord Rak to pop from a
corpse, fortunately he's non agro unless clipped by an AoE, or a shaman
gives him the tear from fear for their epic.

And I'm not on Xegony or I'd want to tag along for my reaver, it, EK
corruptor and VSR and I've got an elaborate scimmy, of course then I've got
a frog, Fish, seahorse, brownie, and seafurbie to get killed.  (and a few
things I can solo camp but haven't yet, eheh)

Um. to answer your question though, you "could" get it at level one since
the reaver is droppable.  In actuality, more like around 50+, maybe a little
lower if you have a few uber friends to help you.
