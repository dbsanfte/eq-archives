Well, I know I am going to get bashed for this post, but looking at the
Arrogant Druids thread, I think this thread is called for.  Just for the
record I do not have a Druid character and I don't think you could pay me to
play one.  Why you might ask:  Because of people like the ones who are
bashing the Druids in the Arrogant Druids thread.
It seems to me that people think and are treating Druids as their SoW, buff,
and heal slaves.  Well you know what they are not.
Try looking at it this way.  Yeah, you are just one person asking for
something and when you don't get it you think humm, what a jerk.  Well try
adding your request upon that of all the other 15 people who have asked the
same Druid for the same thing in the last half hour.  I guess that Druids
are supposed to go around giving people their SoW's and never get from point
a to be or get anything productive done in the time they spend playing on
EQ.
Over two years playing EQ and I have yet to send a tell to a Druid asking
for a SoW.  When I really truly need a SoW, I /ooc with my loc and depending
on how much plat I have on hand offer between 2 and 5p.
Why you wonder, well how about respect for other players time and skills.
By offering at least some plat I am showing the Druids in the zone that I
respect them and value the services they have to offer, which is more
important to them then the measly 2p. By giving my location they can
consider if it is way out of way or if it would just take a up a little bit
of their time.  By /ooc'ing instead of /t'ing I am respecting the fact that
they might be involved in another conversation or not want to be bothered
right at the moment.
What is funny is that I almost always get my SoW fairly quickly and most of
the time they refuse the plat when higher level.  I have had a Druid run all
the way from one end of SK to the other just to give me a SoW and refuse the
plat on top of it.
Most of my friends are Druids and they would drop what they are doing, as
long as not really important, to port me from one place to another.  How
often do I ask them to do this?  On average every couple of months.  I will
get myself from point a to b without bugging them if I possibly can even if
I know they are not really all that busy.
This for me is really a major achievement seeing as my main char is a Bard;
but you know what it makes my mage and ench seem twice as slow then they
really are.
A SoW is not a right or even a privilege; it is a luxury.
So let the flaming begin, just leave my spelling errors and typos out of it.
I will admit right here and now I am a bad speller always have been and
always will be.
