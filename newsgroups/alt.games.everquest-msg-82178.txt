No... but I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. I keep my sense
heading maxed, at each lvl, so it isn't much of a pain except at really low
levels... I have "Spells" in my leftmost top hotkey and "Sense Heading" next
to it... I can't recall ever seeing a userDefined 1 spot under keyboard
options, but then, I'm frequently behind the times! I'll give that a shot,
even though for my older girls it isn't a problem. I do have a new ranger,
however, and I'm planning on getting an Iksar Necro very soon :)

thanks,
Dark
