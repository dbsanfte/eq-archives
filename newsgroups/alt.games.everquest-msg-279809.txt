Well, you do have variety available, people choose not to take advantage 
of it.  Not to mention plenty of other places outside DoN to go as well.

I won't agree with infinitely preferable, but, better, sure.

Why are you doing that?

I still have crap for augs, almost all are the crap dropped augs from 
LDoN.  I barely ever log in to do anything but raid because the monotony 
got to me.  If raiding does get that bad as well, then I will just quit 
EQ.  Heck, I'm still wearing my LDoN bp, which I had to grind out way too 
many monotonous LDoNs to get.

If all I cared about was gearing up, I'd be grinding out DoNs too, but, 
it's too damned boring, so I don't bother, instead, I try to go have fun, 
either elsewhere in game, or not in EQ.

I know exactly what they are like, which is why my DoN progression is 
rather hampered, and I own a total of one spell, and one augment from 
DoN.  However, I did not get all my DoN crystals from repeating the same 
stupid mission over and over again.  Fortunately, there are other people 
out there that enjoy actually trying other things.

If I do actually log in to xp, I do it to hit RSS, RCoD, or MPG trials, 
or some GoD content that I have barely touched.
