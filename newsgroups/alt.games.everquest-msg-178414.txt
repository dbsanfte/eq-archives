I am a Dark Elf necromancer. I freely walk the streets of Qeynos and 
Freeport. I could walk through High Hold Pass if I wanted to do a little 
more effort. I can port into druid portals without being invisible, and 
go anywhere in Surefall Glade visible. I still have to avoid the 
casters, the churches and the monks, but everyone else knows me for the 
adorable evil thing I am, and leaves me alone.

The faction guide at Allakhazam's website is your friend. There is a 
list of faction- what quests and killing what mobs affect the faction. 
You can figure out to whom you would like to be KOS... and adjust your 
behaviour accordingly.

If I was starting over, with the books available now, I'd probably think 
fuck faction- I can always gate to POK to sell. That's one place no one 
can hunt in. It's a tradeskilling mecca. And it's got a bank and food. 
Anyone can do all the shopping there they want. Just use a book or a 
spire and bamf yer there. Convenient.
