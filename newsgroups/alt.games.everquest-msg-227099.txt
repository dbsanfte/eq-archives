Happy ending - I was just playing on my baby Wiz and a GM popped by asked me
where the native Stormhammer characters would like to go. He moved all the
characters I was not on  - asked me to empty my shared bank slot, had any
active corpses then told me to log to desktop whilst he moves the character
I was on.

I don't like being a squeaky wheel but they seem to be the only ones that
get the grease : /
