I was trying to locate "a young ronin" for several hours
yesterday on Tallon Zek.

I was hopping back and forth across the sandy region of
South Ro trying to find 'a young ronin', killing dervs
at both camps... he did not spawn at either camp or any
wanderer in the desert (that I could see).

There are also two derv camps in the SW corner of Oasis, where
the young Ronin is supposed to spawn if you keep killing
off the dervs.  Well, both Oasis derv camps are permenently empty
as far as I can tell.  I was there about 5 times and there
were never any dervs there.  It's not like someone's killing
them off either.  There were only about three people in the
entire zone!  (imagine that!  I guess PvP servers are a bit
different in that respect)

Perhaps it's redundant to say, I never did find a young ronin :(

Anyway, have other people noticed the empty derv camps in Oasis?
Or is it only on TZ where this is happening?

Thanks
