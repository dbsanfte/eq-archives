That was me. I posted that based on the technical drawing on IBM's Web
site. Sorry if I misled you. The diagram and system specs offered very
little real info. 

> I can only assume is the motherboard.
Yup

>At the back, sticking up perpindicular from the mobo is a smaller board with five white slots
That is the PCI Riser Card I saw in the diagram

That is the CPU. You have a Pentium III Slot1 processor. The plastic
slot is brown, but it is not an AGP slot :-)

>This has a card in it...(Matrox).... and say this is my video card.
YES!! And from the description it is in an AGP slot

>Please correct me if I've fucked up again.

Once you finish with these upgrades you will be ready to build your
own PC. I am serious BTW. The only challenge in building your own PC
is in selecting the parts (quality and compatibility). The rest is
just screwing things together and loading software.
