Location:    Neriak, Foreign Quarter, studio of Dark Alliance Network's
highest rating daytime talk show: "Ograh".

The Gimp:    Recently convicted for solicitation. Strong rumours circulating
of substance abuse problems.

Ograh:    Long running Ogress host of her own self named TV show, most
famous for her slimming regime which has enabled her to be wedged into Troll
Feild Plate with minimal use of pig fat lubricant and only two gnomish
winching racks.


Ograh:    "Our next Guest has fallen on hard times recently, just last week
ending up in Justice Pit under embarrassing circumstances. There has been
much speculation as to the reason for his downfall, but we have invited him
here today to defend himself, please welcome, the Gimp"

*The applause dies down and a long minute pass before a halfling stage hand
runs out and whispers something in Ograhs ear, only "toilet" and "passed
out" are audiable to the audience*

Ograh:    "We seem to be having technical difficulties, if you could bear
with us for a moment"

*Ograh get's up and storms off stage, a sound like a door being smashed is
heard in the background and Ograh returns dragging a semi consious Gimp by a
foot, before picking him up and throwing him into the couch and pouring a
jug of Bog Juice over his face*

Gimp:    "Whaaaa....!!  Please Master, let me serve you, don't tell Ramone I
didn't please you, he beats me... errr.... Ah...bullocks, where the hell am
I? Ah yes, Ograh, you were saying Mistress?"

Ograh:    "Glad you could join us. I suppose now is as good a time as any -
is there any truth to the many rumours circulating about you having a
substance abuse problem?"

Gimp:    "Why, none at all, I have no idea why the gutter press make up such
nonsense"

Ograh:    "So, any reason then why you have a rawhide belt wrapped around
your upper arm still? And what's this....*reached accross and thrusts a hand
deep into the Gimps clavicle and pulls out a crude smoking implement* ....is
this a Crystalized Sulfur pipe?"

Gimp:    "Ahh shit.... Well, I 'spose I better come clean Mistress. It's the
stress, day after day of dying in the most demeaning an humiliating fashion,
it takes a toll. My latest Master just has no idea. *shakes head and holds
back a sob*.....First it was a bit of Henbane every now and again to help
cope, then I got onto the Blood of Wolf....it was all downhill from there
really. Hey - you wouldn't have any more of that bog juice would you? Maybe
something stronger? Gnomish spiri...."

Ograh:    "No"

Gimp:    "Shi......err....Shivers"

Ograh:    "And what about your recent run in with the law? Solicitation?
Isn't that a major embarrassment?"

Gimp:    "Well, how else would I make the plat? Crystalized Sulfur and Blood
of Wolf don't come cheap you know - those Gypsies charge a fortune. And do
you realise how much wastage I get taking Blood of Wolf intravenously?
*thrusts forward a bleached white boned forearm* It's hell trying to find a
vein.... So, when master was sleeping, I started to do a bit of moonlighting
on the side. First it was just powerleveling halfling rangers....but they
always want more and more....eventually I started on the Beastlord trade
*shivers*.... At least the plat is good"

Ograh:    "And what does your master think of this, this Chimp fellow? Does
he not care how much stress he is putting on you? Does he not know?"

Gimp:    "He knows...*left eye socket starts twitching uncontrollably*... he
knows exactly how it is, he goes out of his way to make sure I know that
too. He says I deserve it"

Ograh:    "But what could you possibly do to deserve this undeath?"

Gimp:    "He says....*sob* he says that in my past life....I....I was....
French!! There, are you happy now? *sobs uncontrollably*"

Ograh:    "Ewwww, that explains everything.

*Ograh makes a hand gestue and a dozen Elite Ry'Gorr Guards storm onto stage
and rip the Gimp to peices in a whirlwind of bone dust and fur, before
dispersing off to stage left*

Ograh:     "Our next guest ladies and gentlemen...."
