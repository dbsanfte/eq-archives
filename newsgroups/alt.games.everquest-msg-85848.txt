Well, didn't realize that.  I figured you got damage-stuns from the
cleric line a lot earlier.   Still, the reasoning stands:  you're stunning
the mob and inflicting damage.   The damage may be melee-based
but it's that in addition to the stun which is pulling aggro.  You can't
pull aggro using *only* a stun, I'd wager, not once the mob is actually
engaged.

Enchanters aren't going to be doing damage to a mob they've
stunned unless they're low-level or have a death wish.

Yeah, so has my cleric, including 60th level warriors, monks, and
rogues weilding primal weapons.  I'm not that happy about it when
it happens, though.  It's generally followed closely by me running
back to where I belong going "Ouch Ouch Ouch"....    ;)
