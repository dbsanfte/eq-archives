I'm well aware of our internment camps, and lots of far more obnoxious
things that our leaders in and out of government have done.  I'm also
aware that there are a few who consider him a hero today.  That doesn't
make him any less evil.

I certainly believe that the behavior of individuals and institutions
can be considered in terms of "good" (altruism) and "evil" (unmitigated
self-interest) and thus found to lie somewhere in the vast grey area
between them.  Those persons, groups, and actions that are close to one
extreme or the other can reasonably be characterized in those terms.
Most persons, groups, and actions are far nearer the center than either
of the extremes.

I believe that moral relativism is a cop-out, rooted in a refusal to
accept responsibility for the moral implications of your own behavior.
Yes, I do realize that context is crucial too, killing in self-defense
is not the same as murder even though both are homicide.  But it's a
long leap from including context in making judgement to refusing to
judge at all.  "Judge not, lest you be judged" has some value as an
admonition to the small-minded, but it has far more value as a challenge
to those who aspire to a more moral life than the default scrabbling
after a full belly and ephemeral pleasures.
