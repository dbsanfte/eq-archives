I am a level 65 enchanter on Tarrew Marr with about 140 aaxp and all of my PoP spells except Tranquility.

The situation regarding elemental capable and higher guilds here is much as described.  Enchanters and other classes to
a lesser extent are SOL as far as joining unless you are in a rival guild at the same stage of advancement.

I gave up applying to higher end guilds a long time ago.  Being the recruitment officer (although I manage our DKP
system more these days) for Banished Souls, I watch with interest the lamentations of the higher end guilds when
critical members drop out and they have to scavenge from each other.  The PoP flag requirements have helped us in that
respect because our guild is no longer a target for recruitment unlike when PoP was new.

This sounds like a nice opportunity to plant an agent into a higher end guild.  At least 3 of the high end guilds on
Tarrew Marr encourage their members to place alts in lower level guilds as spies.  Turnabout is fair play.
