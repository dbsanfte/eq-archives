Goose/Gander. One of Alfredo's examples that he used to try and counter
Blizzard's policy was people having rights in your home.

The two are virtually identical...it is easier to enforce your will in your
home than in a public place, but the right exists either way.

Some people just seem to think that their rights are more important than
other people's rights.
