That would be me.  Dang it!  Why won't someone help me camp the stupid 
Ancient Cyclops already?  Why have they always either got a 'better' idea, 
or say 'nuh-uh! I already did that once, never again'?

At least I have a cute druid that follows me around a lot.  Or maybe I 
follow her, it's hard to tell. :)
