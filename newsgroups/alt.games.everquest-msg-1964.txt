Thats why its so funny when he keeps saying the extra games included are
"unrelated" and wasting programmers time.  Tanny was programmed entirely
prior to EQ's release and virtually no resources are allocated to update
or maintain it today.  It served as a test bed for the network code on
which EQ was based and still continues to be one of the most engaging
team combat games available, unless you are in an arena full of chams
and heaters, but thats a rant for another NG.
