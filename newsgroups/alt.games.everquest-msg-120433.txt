Well, I do agree on your case about Clerics, they aren't that super
powerful, they don't have super nukes and they will need to group in order
to get higher eventually.  As for Druids, being I have a druid myself, they
aren super uber either...  Porting, great, but only covers areas the new
Luclin spires doesn't cover.  SoW?  Rangers, Beastlords get that at 30,
Shamans get it at 9, works only on the outside and Shamans can make SoW
Potions, and can be replaced by the lesser effect of Tboots or Jboots.
Damage Shield?  Enchanters have a researchable DS, Mages have DS, Rangers
have DS, while not super great, it is still a DS that comes in handy.
Snare?  Rangers have snare as well, they even have a right clicky gloves as
well as druids when they hit 45.  Evac?  Wizards have evac, there is
supposidly a 'Crucible of escape' that also allows that as well.  Buffs?
Stick a Druid in a large group that has cleric, there goes your buff, since
a Cleric of equal level will overwrite your own buff with yours.  Shamans
also have more physical/person buffs, their own STR buff is superior over
your own, you can't enhance DEX or AGI either.  While not having Rez or
Complete heal, you see things like Treants which are technically druids and
not get the benefits they do with say, spirit of Oak.  The best Druid charm
spell just makes it so that the charmed beast doesn't attack you after it
wears off, the pet spell for a druid, at Level 55, gives you a piddly 35
level magic melee bear that can do, at most 29 points of damage, and that
is with it buffed up the wahoo.

As a druid, I only got the Nature Walker's Behest so I can have a minion to
run around whacking low level crap to farm skins and silks and maybe spell
research material for my enchanter so I can med without having to use mana
or waste a bunch of time whacking mobs.  Any mobs that come close to the
level of my little bear, I have to be an active participant, even though I
much rather just let it run amok myself.

Some of us druids would probably like that spell, the NWB, be able to call
up a bear with a little more umph or allow it so we can use it other than
being just a short term meat shield or a shorter term delay tactic.
