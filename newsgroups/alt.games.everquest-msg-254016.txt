After taking some time off from intimidating, I started using it again 
today, in Everfrost hunting mammoths.  I can BARELY take down a yellow 
mammoth on my own, the blue ones I can take on about 50% of my hp bar, 
depending on luck and probably on their actual level.

They don't aggro normally, though, so they let me practice intimidate 
with a plan: I follow them around in melee range mashing intimidate and 
wait for it to go off.  When it does, I hit them with a Leg Chop (snare) 
activate autoattack and start mashing Frenzy.  I get about 15% of the 
way thru a yellow mammoth on average before the fear breaks, which puts 
me well ahead on the race.  On the blue guys I can get as far as 30% 
thru one before fear breaks.

On average, with my intimidate skill around 100 (and if it matters, kick 
40), I get the skill to work once per fight, but by doing this "follow 
em around trying" plan, I can usually get two per fight, one at the 
start and one randomly in the middle.

Problem, though: I found something I've never seen before, because I've 
never wandered around trying to intimidate a mob that didn't hate me. 
Several times, I got a failed kick message, and the mob instantly 
aggroed on me!  First time I wasn't certain, my kick button is near my 
intimidate button and I might have hit it by accident.    Subsequent 
times, though, I was very careful and attentive.  I'd hit intimidate, 
some time would pass without me touching a thing other than movement 
arrows, then suddenly I'd see the failed kick and the mammoth turned on 
me swinging.

I got three skill ups in half an hour, which was extraordinary compared 
to previous use, although it -could- still be just luck.  One of these 
was from having a misc orc targetted and mashing intimidate while out of 
range from him, running around looking for another mammoth to kill.  One 
was while trying and failing the skill chasing a mammoth, and one was in 
mid combat.
