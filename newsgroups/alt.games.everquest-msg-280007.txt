If you are running and want to cast.

Run.....stop, turn left or right a little, then cast.  If you turn while
still the server counts you as non moving and you can cast.

Also.

You can run and cast like a bard.  All you have to do is start cast while
still, run to whereever you want (circles work good), then make sure you are
in the same position you started when you end cast.  Corners are good for
this.
