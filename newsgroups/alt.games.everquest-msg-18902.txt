Over 10,000 night clubs and bars in this country alone desperately
looking for comedians with new material, and you two are wasting your
time playing EverQuest?

But seriously, I've gotten to read some of the FP and other "lighty"
papers thanks to my cleric partner, but I'd be interested in seeing what
the evil cities papers are saying. Anybody found the one in Grobb? Or,
as the comedic genius twins above imply, did Verant just figure that we
can't read so why bother putting one in?
