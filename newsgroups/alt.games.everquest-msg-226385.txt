Yup. The difference is McDonald's is charging for those toys, but SOE
isn't charging for those beta slots... Other than that, the only
difference is SOE screens applicants. They benefit from doing so.
Would you want to see beta slots go to people who are just after a
free preview, aren't going to send bug feedback, and will probably
whine about how buggy it is (beta, duh!) and quit within a week?
Screening thins down that crowd. It's not really a contest, a contest
implies random chance...

Besides, not everyone who wants a McD's toy is going to get it (Just
ask the people who flocked for the mini beanie babies). Just as with
beta slots, offer's only good until they run out.
