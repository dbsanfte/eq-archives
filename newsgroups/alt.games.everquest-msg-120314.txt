With a slower, inny is a really gimp mob.. pretty much any guild who can
clear PoH second floor, can kill Inny.

Cazic though, can be a real monster.  The throwing about is just plain
annoying against Cazic... avater snare and ae knockback, means it takes 5
mins just to get back near him to start fighting again.

It pays to have levitate up versus Cazic (a long lasting one like SoE or dmf
at that), otherwise you will quite literally be thrown half way across the
zone, and take some serious damage
