It stays with the last one you changed it to. "/loadskin default" will
change it back to the original.

I haven't noticed any further lag using custom UIs.

TKing has some really nice spellbook, spell gem/icon, and cast bar
mods. He's starting work on class icons and inventory mods. The guy is

That's the "central" place to find all his stuff. There are also links
at EQInterface.com and EQToolbox. Something I picked up that's easy

HP, mana, xp, and aaxp. (The latter two, I must say, are fantastic to
have)
