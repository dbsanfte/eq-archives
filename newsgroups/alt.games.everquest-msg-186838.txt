    Yes, it's a flat number. When that patch message said the ZEM of The
Hole was upped by 17%, say, what they really meant was the ZEM went from 90
to 105. They don't use the actual ZEM because we don't officially know how
XP is calculated (nor would they want us to, in case they decide to change
it).

    Too bad there are no ZEMs that aren't large whole numbers.

    Read Arcturus's second post in the thread, it's on the first page. In
it, he describes how to do a calculation for a ZEM based on experiment. Look
at the number he gets - it isn't 145%, it's flat-out 145. The ZEM is not a
percentage, it's a whole number.
