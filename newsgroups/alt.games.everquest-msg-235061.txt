I have a toolbox that I bought many years ago from the Gnomes in
Iceclad Ocean.  Well, when I logged in yesterday and opened my toolbox
I noticed the changes for the Tradeskill UI and at the top of the
window it said, "Tinkering (200)".

Before I had a chance to test to see if my Wood Elf Bard was a master
at Tinkering the servers went down.  Has anyone else noticed this with
some of their other items used for tradeskills (like Ovens for
baking)?
