I'd pull to valley right below the tiz caves. Nothing roams there
except an occoasial dwarf guard.  I quad kited there for a while,
never had an add as long as stayed in the valley.  

Around the druid would be rough for 25, not only are there tiz, but
lots of bears and baby wurms. Would definatly get jumped at least once
if stayed there for any length of time.

Valley is best bet, I would even suggest medding there. RIght in the
middle.
