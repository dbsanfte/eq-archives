you'd be surprised about how people think their class should be able to do
everything of every other class.  alot of in game players don't understand /
comprehend the concept of class balance.  Even if they do, they wanna be
able to solo, and this means being self reliant.  being able to do it all
would make it alot easier to solo.

Many a game has been ruined with losing class distinctions.  Kudas to Verant
for giving us more ability to distinguish our chars with 51 + skills in SOL.
