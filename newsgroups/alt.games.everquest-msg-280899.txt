Actually, your home city is a part of creating your character. For those
characters who only have one home city (Vah Shir, Frogloks, etc.,) it
might be a matter of not having to click the home city you want, but
it still has to be clicked past. Unless, of course, that's been changed
in the last few weeks since I created my last character.
