No, you can now pay a buttload of RL cash for them to move your
character info from one server to another, stark raving naked.

Assuming you were ready to drop $500 on purchasing a character,
levels only, equipment doesn't matter, then would an extra $50 be
an issue?

If you were planning on moving, wouldn't the "equipment not an
issue" angle make more sense?"

Now it is suspicious that he doesn't show -some- preference, since
he's looking for a bargain.  Should offer $50 more to be on the
(whichever his target server is) server.

I also can't comprehend not caring about class.  I mean, start in
the higher end of the game, and you start staring down a huge
difference in desirability of the various classes. If you want to
play a character from 1st to 40th, then any class will likely do...
but if you want him for the 50 to 60 game, shouldn't you give
some preference to classes that will actually be welcomed into
groups and raids at that level?

I"d also not be nearly so much inclined to shudder if the guy was
looking to buy a replacement for whatever class it was he
abandoned.  I could step into a cleric on any blue server and
be up to speed in a matter of hours (racial differences, stat
differences, reminding myself what is and isn't possible for
myself and others at my new level might take a little adjustment)
as long as I didn't excede my current level... or heck, if I did
jump up a couple.  Put me in a 52 warrior though and I'd be
one lost sheep.
