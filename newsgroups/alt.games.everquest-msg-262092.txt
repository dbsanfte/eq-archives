I play a 64 chanter, I've never been a charm kiter, nor do I tend to use
charm much. The main reason being the risk involved with the breaking and
the fact that you then have 2 angry mobs coming at you.  It seems to me that
if you are willing to take that risk and risk your group as well, you should
recieve some benefit from it.  A risk vs reward if you will. I think a
better balance would have been to allow the dps that a mob usually does but
give a lessened chance of mezzing or recharming that mob after it wears off.
Sort of this mob is pissed off at you and not as likely to be swayed this
time. That way there is some benefit from it but some risk as well. Not just
another pet that does mediocre damage. Groups could opt for the dps vs a
chance that they could have an uncontrollable mob if charm breaks. Not just
a mob that is running around until the chanter can get another spell off.
