SIGH!

Furthermore, it appears that there is no choice as to whether or not we can
have a password to this room.  The password will be:   ASAGORDER  (one word,
all capitable letters -IF- applicable)

I'm so sorry for this inconvenience.  I surely hope those who aren't really
interested in joining the guild can at best help with its creation.  :)
Again, take care and thank you in advance.
