People keep saying this, but I'm currently in 98 and have been for a
couple years and can count the blue screen errors I've had on two
fingers during that time. The only times I had any was when something
was really screwed up.

Meanwhile, I can't even install XP and get it to work right. Its
incredibly sensitive and on install alone I got tons of blue screens.
Now upon trying to log in I get a stop error everytime. There is some
irony in an OS that is supposed to be better than 98 which I can't
even actually use at all. I believe it has something to do with
putting Lilo for booting linux and the MS operating systems on my
master boot record. XP is insanely sensitive.

98 is pretty dang rock solid. I honestly think its the best MS OS
there is. I'm going to have to back up several things I need, low
level format (which on a 40 gig drive will be something that might
finish after I wake up after 8 hours of sleep....), then slap 98 and
xp on it again. I'll be doing this so 98 will work just as well as
ever and I might be able to use XP for 10 seconds.

I'm kind of wondering if while you were having that blue screen if 
afk guy at the spawn went "ohhh.." and looted the FBE off the corpse.
He'd then act oblivious or leave.
