I bashed 'em good!
Yep I'm Cullin O'Hallan o'da Wolves and I bashed 'em good!
Lemme tell you my story.
I wuz wandering around everfrost when I saw this little magician
crying at de entrance to da scary place wit da gnolls.
She said, "I was wandering around in Black Burrow, I got lost and I,
I... It was horrible!!!, My pet did all he could do to defend me, but
the Gnolls they ALL came after me!" After that she wuz in so many
tears I couldn't make out what she wuz saidin, so I did wut I did best
(nodding my head in aggreement).
I'm not a well traveled barbarian only seen my 6th or 7th lvl by then.
I just kinda preffer to stay at home and drink Black Burrow Stout at
da bar next ta Mac's Kilts.
So I drank me a few tall ones and offered her a drink to
She said no cuz it makes her dumb
I don't believe a little nip or three will make ya dumbs but oh well
Next ting I knew we wuz in the scary gnoll place
They call it Black Burrow
She led me in, we went deeper and deeper.
Then when we got to a place where der was a big mean caster Gnoll I
hear.
"Well done my pretty!!! Thisss here Big Smelly Barbarian is JUST the
ingredient I needed to finish up my latest batch of stout!"
I looked around and got a sinkin feeling as about 10 of dem Ugly Hairy
Nasty stinky Gnolls starts ganging up on me
They beat me pretty bad, I was bleedin' and hurtin and all da time I
heard 'em laffin at me.
One of 'em even shot my poor liddle heart wit an arrow!
Then as I was passin out A kindly wizard and druid walked in.
The druid healed me up good and put some kinda spell on me dat hurt at
first felt like torns rippin tru me flessh. as da wizzy held 'em off.
Well I got up and took my BIG Axe (I made it me self outta rusty one)
Well I don't know what happened next...
All I know wuz dat I started swingin and kickin and slammin, just like
momma taught me.
And da next ting I new, der was gnoll guts all over da place.
Yep I bashed 'em good! I hope you like me story mister bard, but I
gotta get back to what I do best.
Hey bartender can I have another Black Burrow Stout?
