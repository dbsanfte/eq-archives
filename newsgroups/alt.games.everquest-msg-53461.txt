really you wont be obtaining lvl 49 words until you are lvl 50+ (assuming
you are soloing) as they drop off lvl45+ mobs.

a very good place for lvl49 word drops is Timorous Deep from the Raptors.
another good place is Burning Woods from all the mobs there.

but yes, expect to buy them. i got lucky and got the complete lvl 49
research only set for only 500pp in East Commons.
