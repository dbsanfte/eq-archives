}And I agree!.  Whats the difference if we were "born" with it (marlarkie),
}or grew into it - what difference does it make?

Not, in my opinion, a heck of a lot.  But I'd be inteested in your proof 
that the first case is malarky.  There s a significant amount of evidece 
that it may in fact be genetic.

}Its a BEHAVIOR !  ...Are you impling that you can't "control" your sexual 
}"urges", or your sexual "preference" ?.  (which is it)

It's sexual preference.  And the implication, in my eyes, is that you 
shouldn't -have- to "control" your preference in your own bedroom with 
a consenting partner, whether you are able to or not.

}If you can control your "urges", then "preference" is never an issue in 
}a non-sexual setting, then IS it ??

Many people wrongly make it an issue.

}Or are you saying that you want some special reconization
}*of* "preference" when NOT in sexual settings?  The issue in this
}becomes the forcing of acceptance/tollerance of "beliefs" and
}likes/dislikes of NON physical attributes, and I flat-out think
}that is wrong.  We should all be allowed to like/dislike things
}like "behaviors", beliefs, religion, personal preferance, and any
}other NON physical attributes.  Face it, we sterotype all the time
}about non-physical things.

You're allowed to like or dislike all those things.  However, etiquette 
and in some cases law prohibit you to discriminate on those bases.
