You need 1 Blue Diamond, 1 Diamond, 1 Black Sapphire and 1 Jacinth.

Combine each gem in jewel kit with two bars of velium to make mounted gems

Combine all 4 mounted gems on a pottery wheel with 1 small clay, 1 water and
1 purified vial of mana (chanter made, costs 4 rubies)

Put it in kiln with HQ firing sheet.

Combine the result in your jewel kit with a silver bar and a glass shard.

Not trivial at 250

I just made one after first attempt failed, very happy )
