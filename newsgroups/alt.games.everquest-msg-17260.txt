Clarify lag, please.
That may sound stupid but I've seen people say they have 20% lag, that
percent is packet loss, not lag. Lag refers to the latency between sending
and receiving a packet (ping) So do you mean your Packet Loss goes thru the
roof to the point of nearly getting a disconnect or that your ping (the
number on the left, one on right is packets sent) is shooting up and turning
yellow/red?
Or do you mean your system slows up to a crawl?

If it's packet loss, what connection do you have? My friends, when on 56k
modems, had a similar problem (only with the open spell book) it turned out
to be a driver issue for the VGA card. The new detonator drivers were
causing a conflict somewhere, it seemed. If your modem (assuming it is a
modem) is software driven (Winmodem) then the more your CPU does the less
efficent your modem becomes, this would likely give you a higher ping than
an increase in packet loss.

Or, when there are lots of spell effects and every slows down during the
fight? If so then it's your Graphics card but don't feel to bad I know
someone with a 1.2ghz Athlon 256mb and a 64mb Geforce2 Pro and he STILL has
to turn spell effects off in raids. The graphics engine in EQ isn't that
effecient, SoL should sort that out tho'
