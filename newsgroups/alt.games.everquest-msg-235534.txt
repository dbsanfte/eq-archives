Chanter doesn't get any better prices than my gnome wizard.

I prefer to avoid having healers, slowers and CC doing the looting.
Wizards, Rogues, and other DPS classes are far better suited to LDoN
ML'ing.  Wizards especially because I need something to do while the mob
gets beaten down a bit ;)

Seriously, too many times I've seen healers fail to heal because they've
been typing "/g augment dropped roll now" while trying to link the
augmentation in question, and a mob has either wandered in or been pulled
while their attention is diverted.

Same goes for CC and Slowing classes, all of those need to be on the ball
at the start of any fight.

You could have CC and Slowers looting towards the end of a battle when
they're less busy, but if you're chain pulling, then that doesn't work.

Wizards are a good choice if you trust them not to gate out, because
they're often free at the start of a fight, and they certainly aren't busy
during the entire fight unless you're dealing with a lot of mobs.

After ML'ing a lot of LDoN's, here's my 2cp

1. loot drop rate is very, very variable
2. some mobs drop no coin, and if there's a lot of those mobs, it's gonna
be a light split
3. some of the stuff that looks like crap sells for 11pp, and if you get a
good run of them, the split might be better than expected
4. the loot drop rate is very, very variable (I know)
5. not everyone is ripping you off - I sell everything I get that can be
sold
6. did I say how variable the loot drop rate is?  Did two EF LDoN's today,
both all 65th level groups, one we got cash only drops and a single 119pp
gem, and the second we got numerous gems, 11-20pp items, and some cash.
