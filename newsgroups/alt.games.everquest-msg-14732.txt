 And some say kill all the spiders. And some say Kill the undead spawn in 
the tower exactly at midnight. I've forgotten a few of the other more 
screwy theories.
 
 They're all crap if you ask me. 
 
 Go ahead. Ask people that have JBoots how they got them. I'm betting
95% of them say they "just got lucky" or were "in the right place at 
the right time.
 
 My advice is to simply hang around SRO a lot and keep you eyes open
and be ready to kill the AC if you see him.
