>Just curious, why would running it from home be a problem? 

First off how many PCs do you have sharing the connection now? (I
assume you have at least two for you and Lenny). Now add the
following...

1 Dedicated Web Server
???? Annonymous users hitting the web server throught your shared
connection.

See the problem?

Your "pipe" (eq cable connection) is only so wide. You don't want to
clog it with a lot of traffic. You won't be happy, and neither will
your ISP.

It really depends on how popular the site becomes, and how many
simultaneous users you will have.

I am not trying to discourage you. I just wanted to point out some of
the disadvantages to running a site out of your home. You can always
move the site to a remote service if it becomes a problem some time
down the road. (eq gets so popular it causes problems with your
connection and ISP)
