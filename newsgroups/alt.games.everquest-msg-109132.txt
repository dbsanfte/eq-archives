Well, for one, kiting takes room and opens you up to adds.  If the space is
open enough to kite, it's open enough for something to take a liking to
Druid-kabobs.  That balances out the risk vs reward.  Also, in the case of
Druids, it makes up for their essentiality in raids. ( Excellent Soloer +
Average Grouper + Questionably Below Average Raider )/3 = Balanced
character.

Order of the Mallet

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
