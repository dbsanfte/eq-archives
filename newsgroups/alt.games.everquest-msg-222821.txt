You could also ask a mage to summon some gear for your pet:  
2 Dagger of Symbols --- each has +5 magic resist 
Elemental Defender  --- back/shield slot item with +5 magic resist
Elemental Blanket --- Shoulder slot item with +15 resist

If the mage is high enough, he may be able to summon a Mask of Mardu.
The mask does not add any magic resist but it does add haste. A hasted
pet is more likely to interrupt the caster.
