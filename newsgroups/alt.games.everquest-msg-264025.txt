I've been getting some weird keyboard behavior ever since I installed a
new ATI Radeon 9800 Pro videocard in favor of an older GeForce4 ti 4200.

Shift+up/down arrows won't recall command history, shift+pgup/pgdn won't
scroll in the chat buffer, arrow keys won't move me whilst im autorunning
with NumLock.

The keys on the number pad do work, but I'm used to the separate clusters
of arrow and pgup/pgdn keys.

I haven't extensively tested the behavior of these keys outside of
Everquest; they seem to be behaving normally.

Any ideas?
