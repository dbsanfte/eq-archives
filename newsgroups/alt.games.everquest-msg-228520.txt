    That's any two hits. So, for example, when you're doing that mob with
the brutal AE damage spell, Jobober ignores the first two AE's and you don't
build additional hate healing Jobober early (since nobody else will heal a
pet).

    Recast and mana allowing, yes. You'd need to compare how much mana it
takes to heal the pet for the expected damage with how much mana you use on
Calliav to see if it's worthwhile, though.

    Using the LDoN database at www.squidbox.com, I see Guard of Calliav is a
450 point spell in the Mistmoore theme.

    Same database: 410 points, Guk theme.
