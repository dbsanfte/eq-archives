I see your problem, you are trying to have an RL life.  You just need to fix
that,
and you can level quite quickly.

I've been playing for about 4 months now, highest level character I have is
21,
then one 11, one 10, and one 5 o 6, don't remember for sure.  There are a
couple of
reasons for that,

1.  I do have an RL.
2.  I have fun just exploring, trying trade skills, just seeing what is out
there,
     I don't make it my goal to level, or collect cash, I just have fun.

Graeme, Barbarian Shaman of 21 seasons, Erollisi Marr
Giluven, Wood Elf Druid of 11 seasons (Yes I know, yet another WE Druid, but
I just love the spells, even at level 11, really looking forward to tp)
Vardan, Dwarf Paladin of 10 seasons (Mostly abandoned)
Tuker, DE SK of 5 or 6 seasons, (really want to start getting spells,
thinking of
abandoning him for a necromancer)

Oh, yeah, almost forgot, on some other random server, I have a, yes, you
guessed it,
wood elf ranger at level 6ish, first character I created.
