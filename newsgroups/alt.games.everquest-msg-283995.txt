	Hmmm, well, when I play a cleric I try very hard to keep
*everyone* alive unless it means letting me or the tank die.  Part
of it's just that I don't like to let people die.  Part of it's 
common sense:  the more people I keep up the more DPS we have, and 
the more people to deal with adds or whatever.  We can kill much faster
with a full group than with 2/3's of one...

	I mean, hey, if I get low on mana I can always bother the
necro... :-) And almost any amount of healing is cheaper than rez and rebuff.
