Play your Iksar, periodically shouting, "hey, is anyone traveling
to the Freeport area who would want to deliver an item for me?"  :-)

Alternately, have your Iksar watch for a high-level Wizard who
is willing to port or Translocate you to the Wizard pyramid
in North Ro.  Before you take the trip, put all your armor
and equipment and money in the bank, except for the Shroud.
(You might not want to do this until you hit level five,
in case you die upon arrival in N.Ro. -- this will give you
plenty of time to return to your corpse.)

Get ported.

Have your Monk go to North Ro to pick up the Shroud.

Have your Iksar get killed.  Ta daa, he's back home, and
there's nothing left on his corpse worth recovering.  Go
back to the Cabilis bank and get dressed again.  The
slang term for this is the "Warrior's Gate spell".
