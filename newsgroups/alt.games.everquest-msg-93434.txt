The only problem I have with the forums at EQBeastlord, and the
BL forums at Caster's realm is that the percentage of "My class is 
broken" whiners seems to be excessive.  Of course, that's my main
gripe with Mage compendium and the Mage forums at Caster's realm
as well.  Do all class specific boards suffer from this?  Or do
I enjoy playing classes that just attract that sort of individual,
and if so, what does that say about me?  :-/
