Er... what place *doesn't* suck for loot, and has slightly higher level 
stuff, as well as people wanting to actually group?  Out of curiosity :) 
A necro friend of mine who's 37, and me who's been on the last bubble 
before 36 for a week are sick of DSP - little loot unless your group is 
willing to pull the gatherers (which not many people do), and getting a 
group takes a !#@% age up there.  We're both ready for something else 
entirely, but going through the list, we couldn't find many places we 
hadn't tried and found it either too blue, or no groups.
