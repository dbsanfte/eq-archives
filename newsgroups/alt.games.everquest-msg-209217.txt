    Sorry you lost me there...? Never killed aviaks myself, well one or two
in passing but no more than that.

    Well the way I look at it, there *is* kinda a shortage of them. I'll
qualify that, this being the newsgroup that it is <g>. I've been in that
zone with 17 people mostly high level, all going for hill giants, and almost
never run short. I've also been in it with 8 people and been constantly out
of giants, unable to find one unengaged. I once took out all of the giants
almost by myself, and ran out...

    The biggest factor that I can see is placeholders... if you can get 17
relatively high level people smacking down everything in the area, giants
are plentiful. On the other hand, if it seems to me like I'm the only guy
killing mobs other than giants, they're a really rare spawn. This seems to
support the assertion others have made that they spawn on rotation with the
other mobs in that area.

    I have to admit though, that when I havent been able to land a snare on
a giant in 20 minutes or more and I run off the hill and see one druid with
six rooted, I get annoyed. How many placeholders does a druid with 6 rooted
and dotted giants kill? Six... really slowly.

    But on the other hand, if it wasn't such a pain in the butt farming
plat, more people would do it, and the value of plat would drop... still it
would be nice if you could go there, explain the placeholders thing once and
get total cooperation. I have a button for it now, click and it /ooc's about
killing placeholders. Usually gives a slight boost to the giant population
over the next half hour or so.

    Yeah I do find that 90-95% of people are just fine, even if some of them
refuse to kill placeholders (or even argue vehemently that there are none
and giants spawn on their own timer), but that leaves somewhere between one
in twenty and one in ten people who is a total, total fuckbag - and in a
zone with usually 10-15 ppl in it, that's a lot of fuckbags over a 3 hour
period <g>
