Except they're not that rare.  They were dropping like *rain* in Akheva
Ruins last night: we had 2 groups there for 5 hours or so, and by the
end everyone had one, and some of us had 2 of them.  Centis were also
dropping a 15/32 1hb, and a 20/30 2 hand piercer with amazing
regularity, and mind worms dropped 10/22 piercers at a rate of a couple
every hour.  Twinktwinktwink.

Given that the centi longsword is better than a Lammy in the offhand,
and only slightly worse in the main hand (at high levels, anyway), I
fully expect the drops on this sword to be nerfed pretty soon.  It's
going to kill the price of a Lammy.

10K is overpriced anyhow: if they were as rare as a Lammy, maybe 6-8K,
but right now, they're dropping like Fine Steel.  60pp from a vendor is
pretty funny though :)
