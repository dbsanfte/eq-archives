    That's an example of giving the SK too much. I couldn't find a SBS for
50 pp or less, and doubt anyone could on other servers either. The cheapest
shield I could find that met my criteria was the Shiny Brass Shield.

    Centi SS is more expensive than 50 pp. I imagine they got Ghoulsbane
because it was questable for free. Otherwise, they should have been swinging
the 13/31 Crystalline Blade. Did any of the kits get multiple weapons? That
might be why there was no two-hander for the SK's, anyways, so the large
races didn't have a DPS advantage using Slam.

    The Goranga Idol did come in at 50 pp when I did my experiment, so it
should have been available to everyone. And putting a bow on a class with
ranged attacks (stun) like a paladin seems silly.
