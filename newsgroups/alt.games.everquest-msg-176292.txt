Thanks to all for the responses. As I understand it, your point about
it being difficult to regain aggro once it's lost to a SK, for
example, would apply for a wizard as well. If a wizard nukes
prematurely, it is going to be tough to get the mob off of them.

Since, as I also understand it, other tank classes cannot absorb
damage as well as a warrior, it would also be in *their* best intrests
to hold off on aggro-intensive actions until the warrior establishes
adequate hate.

Do I have this right? Of course I'm assuming similarly equipped
characters here.
