Patrik,

It's nice that you lead such an insular life and are not exposed to the ugly
side of U.S. history.  The negerJoe name is reflective of nigger Joe, which
is a definite racial slur here in the U.S.  In this case, it's probably an
adult, because it's a rather old reference.  I could be wrong, because I'm
not familiar with what is current in the world of racial slurs.  The fact
that it got into a pop song from the 70's is irrelevant.  The fact is that
this is a clearly degrading name, and should be removed.

Cheers,
Eric
