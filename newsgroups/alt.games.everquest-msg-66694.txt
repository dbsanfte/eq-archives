I think he's thinking of something like the way it works in D&D.
Basically, the way it works in D&D now is when you ding, you can go up
a level in any class.  For example, suppose you were a level 8 rogue.
You earn enough XP to reach 9.  Instead of going up to 9 as a rogue,
you could choose to become a level 8 rogue/level 1 wizard, which
counts as a level 9 character.  You'd gain the same number of HP a
level 1 wizard would gain, and you'd get the skill increases of a
wizard.  Continuing, when you reach level 10, you could either become
a 9 rogue/1 wizard, or an 8 rogue/2 wizard, getting the appropriate
stat and skill mods of the path you chose.  Adding a third class is
similar.
