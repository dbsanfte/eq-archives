Just put one point in any special attack as these will go up easily enough as
you fight to get to your next skill. You shouldn't need to put any into Bind
Wound, or Mend for that matter, if you use the healing strategy of binding to
50% then using Mend. A good place to put practice points is Instil Doubt
(Intimidation) which takes forever to go up otherwise. HTH. :)
