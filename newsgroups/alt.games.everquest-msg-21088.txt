I've seen a few things like that myself, though surely not unique.
1) Crushbone belts for a few silver.
2) Bracer of Battle for 40pp (regularly auctions for 50pp)
3) Two Giant Militia Swords for 7gp each
4) I'll regularly see small bronze armor being sold for less than the 2pp/ac
that it goes for in auction

Mind you, this is for a Dwarf warrior with all of 45 points in Charisma :-)
