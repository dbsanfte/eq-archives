How true...  I think Necros just might be the most powerful class in the
game today!  I've had 3 occassions when I've gotten a bit upset by jerks
doing or more often shouting idiotic crap and responded as I usually respond
to such assholes in RL by being somewhat unpleasent and aggressive...
actually really sarcastically cutting, cruel and extreamly aggressive (don't
blame me, blame Uncle Sam... I was a shy, timid introvert before I entered
the Military) and been meet with a challenge to duel which fortunatly has
only happened while playing my Shaman.  Short of it... crushed an Orge SK
one level below me in LOIO, destroyed a Mage 2 levels higher in DL and
totally owned a Wiz something like 3 or 4 levels higher in OOT...
supprisingly all 3 made the same fatal mistake, they challenged me which
gave me the chance to target them and choose when to let the shit hit the
fan, and more importantly either failed to notice my pet or just decided
since it was a Shammy pet to ignore it.  Bad decisssion to be sure, but to
the point,  the only class I wouldn't duel is a Necro, even one 3 or 4
levels below me!  I believe they'd own me out right!  They have the best pet
in the game, horrifically leathal dmg spells and that awsome life tap line
of spells not to mention others like the fear line.  Necros are the only
class I've seen successfully playing in a pair in PoN and never stopping for
more than a min. or two...  awsome indeed!  Now imagine a Necro on mind
candy!  Now thats scary!  Why shouldn't they take advantage of any and all
enhancements offered to them?  In my opinon (and I already know its
worthless so don't bother tell me) anyone who casts is remiss if they don't
take advantage of mana regenerating spells when available.

Oh, and I agree about Mages... my 37 has been sitting gathering dust in the
box for almost a year now and when I do pull him out to play again if KEI is
there he'll have it! LOL
