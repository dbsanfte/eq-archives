Okay ... I'm an idiot.  Now that we have *that* out of the way ....

My cleric received a 10-shot potion (Blood of the Wolf) as a donation for a
bind recently.  I have no earthly idea how to use it.

I've tried right-clicking .... left clicking ... <CTRL><Left click> ...
<CTRL><Right click> .... putting it in my weapon slot (It won't go there)
... nothing worked.

I'm just about to ready to burn the Shiny Card I found on the ground in
Steamfont (no clue about that one either, other than it was close to where
Watchman Halv is normally stationed) and dance naked around the fire in
hopes that a cleansing ritual may help.

So ... if you don't want to see a naked dwarf dancing around a small fire,
please help me out!

Crash
