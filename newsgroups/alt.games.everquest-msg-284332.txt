On raid content up to at least GoD, the Warrior will always win purely
because of defensive.  SK MT's don't start to really work until you're
raiding content 2 expansions behind the gear you're in.

This is why successful raid guilds have a class quota, to answer another
question you asked recently.

However on raids where there's a significant amount of trash clearing to
do, SK's and Paladins are a better choice for MA on that stuff in my
opinion due to their superior snap aggro.
