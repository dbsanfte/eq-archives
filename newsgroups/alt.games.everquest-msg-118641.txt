So was it daddy or daughter who posted in alt.spanking for a
"spankee"? Inquiring minds want to know. . .   /grins evilly

I'm sorry, it was wrong to ask, I know; I just couldn't resist. =P

All I can add to what everyone else has said is me too. I am a parent
myself. If the "daughter" story is true (and I really, really,
seriously doubt that it is), then you are simply another one of those
people who shouldn't have had kids in the first place. I suggest you
consider giving them up to someone who is willing and able to actually
look after them. (Hint: It is not the responsibility of a newsgroup to
do so.) Otherwise, good luck on your quasi-ebay attempt. Please be
sure to post back here with your server and character name if you
succeed so we'll all know not to group with ya. thx la~

Mey <= my daughter's computer doesn't even *have* a modem, and won't
any time soon for obvious reasons
