Hehe, that I'll grant you.  I remember playing the original adventure game 
(that eventually became Zork).  Man, that was fun; my imagination was much 
better than any current computer graphics.  And I remember how excited I was 
to be playing a friend's Pong game - that was the best thing ever!  We were 
too poor to have one, which is just as well since we couldn't afford to have 
our television tube burned out prematurely.  =)

It's probably more accurate to call Scott Adams one of the pioneers of 
computer gaming.  Still, the use of whatever this PLATO was as a 
counter-example was poorly chosen.
