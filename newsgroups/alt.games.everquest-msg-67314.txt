Please check your internet connection and try again.

I get this over and over and over with the new patcher.  This may be a
problem with my ISP, they are fairly inept, however it started happening as
soon as I upgraded.  I cannot get the whole patch to download (for about 5
days now).  It's really depressing and I am seriously considering another
ISP to at least test it out.

Anyone else getting this problem?  or do I need to tell my ISP to shove it?

By the way tracert's return really goofy results as well.  They will be sub
200 (very acceptable returns) for the most part and then in the middle
they'll time out completely for about 5 seconds and then return to sub 200
numbers.  VERY STRANGE.

So it may be my ISP.
