Id have a chanter over a bard anyday. Chanter can keep tank hasted and
casters claritied at much less % of their total time. I also think that you
should have a porter/evacer in the group, and often you will need a snarer,
so Id replace the shaman with a druid...
giving you warrior, druid, cleric, enchanter.
Kinda looks a bit low on damage output tho. I dont see how to fix this
either, without adding another member.
I dont think a perfect 4 person group exists, unless you have a particular
hunting place in mind.
