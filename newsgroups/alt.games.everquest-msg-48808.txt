I'd go for dragon faction, in other words, kill as many giants as you
can.  You can invis yourself to go thru Kael if you have to. Not being

You won't be able to get any velious armour solo unless you have a lot
of money to get someone to multiquest, and you can get a warning for
auctioning for someone to do it. It is, afterall, an exploit.

After 50 you will stay in cobalt scars. There is a bank and vendors
inside Skyshrine, right near the CS zone.  Also stay on good terms
with the Othmir in CS, they are vendors too.
