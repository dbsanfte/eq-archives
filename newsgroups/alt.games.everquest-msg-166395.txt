A few things to look at speaking from personal experience. Make sure you
have a high refresh rate for your display. I recommend no less than 85hz.
Lower refresh rates can cause a headache due to present but not obvious
flicker in the picture. Make sure your computer is actually up to the task
of displaying the picture at a sufficient frame rate<fps>frames per second.
Anything less than 24fps can also cause a headache as the picture's
movements will be jerky, this is something people's perception of varies
with, I am very particular about this item.
Size does matter, if you want to continue to play and enjoy such games, get
a 21 inch monitor of good quality. My gaming associates like to poke fun at
me for the monitor I have. I quote them as a wise woman once told me "you
can make more money to buy a good monitor but you can't buy better eyes"
Spare no expense on your system when it comes to the display, scrimp on
other parts if need be but your primary input will be through your eyes so
make the best of it and save them in the long run. CPU speed, Video Card,
Memory, a number of things impact your computer's display performance.
Working on computers with static displays of spreadsheets, helpdesk tools,
office apps etc. is little comparison to the effects 3d full motion gaming
can produce. The environment around your computer is also important. Keep
all magnetic field generating items away from the monitor, i.e.. anything
with one of those little blocky plugs that houses a transformer, lamps, or
anything you might be suspicious of. Such items can cause waves or jittering
of the display independent of the equipment itself. I once had a customer
that insisted his monitor was bad and after having him investigate, it was
discovered that an electrical conduit was in the wall behind the monitor and
was the cause of trouble. Another fellow had similar trouble from a dimmer
lamp nearby, the potentiometer in the lamp was responsible. Fluorescent
lighting in the computer room is also bad. Many incandescent bulbs also will
exhibit unseen but measurable flicker, the AC power runs at 60hz and
reflection on the monitor will produce effects just as bad as a 60hz refresh
rate. I have left out a few things and tweaks to keep this from becoming a
book :) This should be enough material for you to examine and test for a
bit. Hopefully you will find something that corrects the health issues for
you and allows you to continue enjoying computer gaming :)
