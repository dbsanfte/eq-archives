Bard DoT chants do NOT stack.
In this particular case, since almost all bard ToTs (targeted
or AoE) also include a debuff of some sort, Verant excluded
them specifically so that the debuff portion could not be
stacked. (They said so specifically in the patch message,
by the by)

A rundown of all bard DoT songs, for those keeping track at home.

lv2, AOE, Chords of Dissonance ... stacks
lv18, AOE, Denons Disruptive Dischord ... does not stack (AC debuff)
lv30, Targeted, Fufil's Curtailing Chant ... does not stack (MR debuff)
lv38, Targeted, Chant of Flame ... does not stack (FR debuff)
lv46, Targeted, Chant of Frost ... does not stack (CR debuff)
lv48, AOE, Selo's Chords of Cessation ... unsure (slow debuff)
lv59, AOE, Denon's Bereavement ... does not stack (MR debuff)

So basicaly another upgrade that bards were excluded from.
