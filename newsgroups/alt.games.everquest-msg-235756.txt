I disagree.  I played on the Innorruk Server for over three years before I
left the game.  Now I am back some 8 months later and playing on Stromm.
Stromm is newbie.  There are some I have met that are only there to take a
break from their main servers but I have had to explain more to people I
have grouped with about the game then I ever had to do on Inny.  The
Newbieness is very apparent in the Bazaar.  There just is not that much high
level gear being sold.  On Inny if you wanted a T Staff for your Monk or a
Windblade for your Pally you would only have to go to the bazaar and buy
one.  These and many more common items are very rare on Stromm leading me to
believe that there must be a shortage of uber high levels farming these
things.
