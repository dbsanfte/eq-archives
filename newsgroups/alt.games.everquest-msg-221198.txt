LOIO was once one of the most populated zones in the game.  Now,
its a waste land.  What's changed?  Well for one thing, other
zones have been added that compete with it, and there are of
course fewer players in its level range as the game matures.  But
thats not enough to explain a drop from 120+ people to around 3
people.  What changed was the ZEM, once one of the better ones in
the game (110 I think?) its now been nerfed down to 60, lower
than that of any zone in the game (65?  something really low like
that anyway).  Its still a great zone filled with outdoor pulling
and dungeon style pulling (but still allowing outdoor only
spells), relatively easy mobs, some degree of actual loot,
faction work, and for me at least, fond memories.  But I can kill
3 mobs there and see little more experience for my efforts than
killing one in Paladul... or to be more fair, Kurns Tower, which
is also a Kunark era zone.  Kurns is jam packed full of easily
single pulled non casting mobs with low damage output and low hit
points, the only thing that could concievably make it more
difficult than LOIO is that you can't cast "outdoor only" spells
in there.  But you won't need Harmony, and you can easily step
outside to refresh SOW if you want to keep that up.  

I recall a time shortly after the Hole was introduced when it was
deserted; people went in and tried it out, it was too hard for
them, and they went back to doing easier and more lucrative
things.  Then there was a big ZEM boost, and the largest boost,
it was announced, went to the Hole.  Suddenly people were killing
there, the entrance always had a group, and there was very often
another down over the lip outside the castle; basically if you
could find a porter to get the tanks out, you moved down there
for even better exp and left the upper reaches to the one or two
groups holding that down.  Full time, 24/7, there would be a
group there.  Then POP came along and suddenly its deserted
again, because you get even More exp in POP (and then for some
reason they changed the zone to make it harder, like it wasn't
already abandoned by the player base?)

Look higher, where are people working in their 50s?  In the
Dreadlands?  Some are, after all, its relatively easy exp.  But
lots more are in the POP zones, and why?  Well despite being much
more difficult, the exp is also far better per kill.  So if you
can manage to sustain anything close to the same kill rate, you
advance much faster in POP.

I can't, offhand, think of a high ZEM zone thats deserted, unless
its because there are other equally high ZEM zones that are
easier to get to and to kill in.  If Kurns was only 10% better
than LOIO, I bet the lake would be populated again; not crowded,
but populated.
