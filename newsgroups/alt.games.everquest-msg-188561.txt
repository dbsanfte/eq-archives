then when we all
zoned from train-with one dead-he quits group with no explanation and
lfg's to zone-others pissed as much as I-so we sort it all out, get 2
new peeps, but one short-and the dang group leader reinvites him back
in!!-says guys explained he left group by 'mistake'-so i'm fuming
since i asked he not get back in-but i shut up, and go along-we try to
retake room, but get massive jumped in LCY, this stinking thief
dies(not my fault-honest! :)

Read that carefully again, and tell me how I was assuming he had time?

You're the one who invented things that were manifestly NOT in the
original post.  He flat out says he decided to go along.

At the point where group leader is saying the guy explained, I'd
be saying "Sorry guys, I'm not grouping with him.  You all have fun."
