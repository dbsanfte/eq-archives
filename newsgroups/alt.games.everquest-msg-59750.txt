    That would be a great theory, except I'm killing the same mob in both
cases. Because of the level range of mobs, only the highest level Mountain
Giant Tumps in Frontier Mountains are still blue to my monk. All other Tumps
are light blue. I've killed several of both, and the pattern holds: almost a
half blue for a blue Tump, maybe a pixel (*if any bar movement at all*) for
a light blue Tump. At some point I must have killed a light blue Tump that
was only one level lower than the blue ones. The ratio of XP for the light
blue to XP for the blue, by your thinking, would be X^2/(X+1)^2, where X is
the level of the light blue. To first approximation that ratio is what, 1 -
2/x? Tumps are in the level 30 range, so I should be getting about 14/15th
as much XP for a light blue as a blue - and I am NOT seeing that.

    And I apologize for the math. 8)
