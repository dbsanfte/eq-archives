Well, I for one am not willing to be the first to put my family at
risk to prove a point.  I agree with your logic to a point but the
fact is my family is going to walk away from an accident in far more
instances than others might.
Yes, some SUV's are prone to roll but not all.  The Suburban has never
been on any safety issue lists that I've ever seen and I've looked.  I
find alot of other SUV's that are supposedly in the same class on
those lists though.  I dont' know why I just know it is.

Yes if my family is involved in a crash then the other party is more
likely to get hurt.  But I would rather that than the other way
around.
