What I meant was that if you already had a higher lvl character in EQ2
and wanted to make a new character.

By far my biggest complaint about EQ2 is all the bugs. Summoners have
a TON of them (more than any other class) and since it's the only
class I wanted to play, I'm thinking about quitting simply for that
reason. That, and it gets next to impossible to get any decent XP solo
by the mid lvls.
