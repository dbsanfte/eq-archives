Yes, I'm bitter.  D'you know WHY I'm bitter?  Because although I'm quite
prepared to laugh at my own failings in whatever area they occur (and
believe you me they occur in a lot of areas), I get a little bit riled with
people who are pointlessly smug.  So you managed to do better than me,
that's great.  I really am pleased for you.  But what did you expect?  Did
you think "I've managed to get 2 chars to 40, one to 35, and numerous others
in their teens" was going to improve my mood?  In what way does that help
me?

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
