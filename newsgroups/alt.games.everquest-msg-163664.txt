Giggling manically and surrounded by armed hamsters,

I petitioned my own name once. I decided I didn't like it, but there
was nothing illegal about it, and that character was L30. Still is
come to think of it, haven't played that sk in years. I did my best to

Swahili, but they turned me down. :-p
