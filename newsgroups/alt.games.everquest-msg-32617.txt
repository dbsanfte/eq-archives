You did, actually -- but the TradeFolkIll faction change
isn't her primary one:

   Olunea Miltin says 'Great !! Thank you stranger. The rogues
   must have broken it.  At least I can repair it. [snip]
   Your faction standing with TheFreeportMilitia got better
   Your faction standing with CoalitionofTradeFolkIll got better
   Your faction standing with KnightsofTruth got worse
   Your faction standing with PriestsofMarr got worse
   You gain experience!!

And here are the faction changes for killing her:

   You backstab Olunea Miltin for 69 points of damage.
   You have slain Olunea Miltin!
   Your faction standing with TheFreeportMilitia got worse
   Your faction standing with CoalitionofTradeFolkIll got worse
   Your faction standing with KnightsofTruth got better
   Your faction standing with PriestsofMarr got better
   Olunea Miltin says 'I do not think the patrons of the
   Grub N' Grog are going to take a liking to your evil deed.

When I was KoS to the Freeport Militia, but Warmly to the
FP rogues, Olunea was KoS to me as well.  As I repaired
my Freeport Militia faction, my /con of her rose as well.
