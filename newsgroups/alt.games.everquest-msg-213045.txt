Well I have a 57 bard and a 30 magician, never teamed either with the other
class much though.

Here's the problem; bards help melee battles by haste and DS and HP regen...
but like all bard group buffs, these won't land on the pet.  Magicians do most
of their damage output in a general exp group via pet, and in a group without
a healer, they can function as healer but only if its their pet thats MA, and
due to changes in the pet aggro system quite some time ago, if there's a PC in
melee range of a mob then the pet will be 100% unable to taunt that mob off
the PC.  So the bard won't be able to come in and melee and yet have the pet
serve as MA.

And one of the great benefits of the modern mage, summoned focus items, are
useless to the bard, the only caster class which didn't get boosted by the
addition of all the focus effects

Bards are a flexible class though, and can probably adapt to these
limitations, lets see.  Still have Slow, which the magician lacks, while the
mage can haste her own pet.  Snare too, magician will like having snare.  Hmm,
could fear kite, then the MA situation wouldn't be important, and bard could
twist in self haste which is much better than his group haste anyway.  Also,
bard can supply mana, which will allow the mage to do more nuking and have
less down time, can easily run in and tank for the pet if he's not quite going
to make it, and then regen HP to "heal" up afterwards.  Bard can also use DD
or DOTs to supplement damage, and the DOTs will each have a different resist
debuff, so choosing the ones that lower magic and fire will help the mage land
spells easier and for fuller damage.

There comes a point in a bards life, though, when suddenly instead of trying
to figure out how to help the mage, he's going to be trying to figure out
where to hide the mage so he can make real experience.  Once he gets charm,
he's capable of killing mobs at swarm speed, six on one or more, very unfair
to the poor mobs.  Mage isn't going to be much help at all there, though, as
she can't nuke or AE the swarm without interfereing with the limited aggro
retention capabilities of a charmed pet.  What to do with the mage becomes the
question, suddenly.  Well, mage can DS the charmed pet, which can be a bigger
help than it might seem, since the goal eventually is to kill all the mobs in
that swarm.  And mage can easily slaughter off the former pets as charm is
broken, a job bards don't do spectacularly well, leaving the bard free to
concentrate on charming his next target and gettting the swarm back on track.
And mage can coast a while, she's been carrying the duo till this point, five
quick levels and she'll be back on duty for a couple, then another quick 15 or
so and bard will stop being such and overwhelming killing machine.

OR you can scale back a bit from swarm kiting, and use a more traditional one
on one charm technique, where the bard gets a strong pet and uses it to kill
weaker opponents.  With this style, the mage can use pets and judicious
nuking, and the DS is quite effective, plus mage pet can be used to soak up
some of the damage and, if you use air pet, function as a sort of slow.  And
you can even arm the charmed pet with summoned weapons, although that might
look imprudent later if the bard goes LD.  This won't be as blindingly fast as
the rather dizzying art of swarm kiting, but it is very effective and lets you
kill bigger targets at some levels, taking longer but getting a better reward
per kill, and since it would make better use of a mage partner, might actually
end up better for the duo.

Or you could have the bard hate kite the mobs, put mage pet on no taunt in
chase mode, and the bard can run his little kite string in nice loops around
the sitting mage who occaisionally stands up to drop a nuke on the poor
target.  This would let bard use full chant kite techniques which is good
steady killing, if not spectacular like swarming.

All in all, perhaps not the ideal pair, but plenty of options, hardly crippled
by any standards.  Have fun!
