I think the point I was considering about a 800 / 877 number was for those
customers who couldn't access their accounts / effective emergencies.

I guess a few other instances would be okay, like losing all your equipment
and the GM on hand on your server approving of you to get it replaced.

Having a GM / CS who could do these few fixes for you would be really nice.

Like right now I gotta wait until Jan 2nd to get the server GM to help me
get my last three names on bristlebane.  being normal names apearantly
doesn't allow me to just use the /surname command.
