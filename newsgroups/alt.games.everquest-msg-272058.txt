I cannot speak knowledgeably about complaints #1 and #2, but what's this about "obvious
forced grouping?"

IIRC, Gates of Discord introduced single-player tasks.  I've run a few of these, each of
which took less than 15 minutes to complete, and rewarded me with approximately the same
amount of XP that I'd get from successfully soloing 2x mobs...which would take about 15
minutes with regen time.

Another point: if they made high-level mobs easy enough to solo, they'd always be dead
when you went looking for them.
