Well, it implies increased fitness for the current niche; this is 
generally unrelated to what human beings may consider "improvement". As 
the cow-like ancestors of the current whales returned to the sea, could 
they be said to have "improved"? They became fitter for the ecological 
niche they were occupying, but if circumstances were to change, the food 
became more plentiful in shallow coastal areas, and they evolved again 
into something resembling what they were before, it could hardly be said 
that they had "improved" again.
