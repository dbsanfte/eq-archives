I have gotten my Frog Shaman to 40 and now I am seeing that many of his
spells cannot be purchased from merchants.  But with the release of GoD many
of the once quested or NPC drop only spells are appearing on merchants.
Does anyone know of a website that is up to date on this information?

Thanks,

LM
