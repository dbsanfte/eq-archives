I just bought my first quasi-uber item.... Essence of Dol. I know, I know, 
this is not a big deal to many of you, but I paid 200 plat for it so my 21 
monk could get his 1hb skill above 3. At 8/22 the damn things almost 
outdamages my 2hb Bamboo Bo Stick, and that's *before* my primary hand 
works it's booty.

Awesome.
