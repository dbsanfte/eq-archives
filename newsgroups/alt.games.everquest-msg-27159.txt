Don't bother.
I've been here a while and posted fairly regularly. I'm getting pretty tired
of seeing every discussion here become an anal and repetitive argument about
posting style/spelling/naming conventions/exploit interpretations, as
happened in this case. I thought I was making a fairly good point, but it is
ignored in favour of picking over my hastily-made, under-snipped post (not
something I've made a habit of in nearly 2 years here, you'll note).
Anyway, signal-to-noise ratio too low for my tastes. Time to move on. . .
