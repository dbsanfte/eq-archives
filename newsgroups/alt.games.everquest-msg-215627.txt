Ararrggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

If you're hoping for something constructive - best move on.

So LDoN has confirmed that most people get to 40th level without learning
_anything_ about grouping.

No idea about /assist, no idea about what other classes can do, no idea
about teamwork, no idea about travelling somewhere as a single group so
people don't get mugged on their own by Brownie Scouts.

<sigh>

This was a much longer rant, but it lost focus and dried up.  Suffice it to
say, I won't be doing any LDoN stuff with pick up groups again in a hurry.
