I hooked my two computers together via an ethernet hub to form a 
mini-LAN, then put my entire EQ folder into my shared files folder on my 
old machine, copied it to my shared files folder on my new machine, then 
copied that back out to form a new EQ folder on the new machine, and 
made a shortcut to the EQ exe file on my desktop.

When I logged in, I got dumped to options to select my video card for 
the new machine, that was the only noticable change logging in.

Once in, I had to go in to Options Display and dial down my Gamma, which 
was screamingly bright on the new machine compared to my old one.

I also found that I was zoning very slowly the first time into any zone, 
presumably because I was loading new graphics due to the new video card, 
something that will probably be repeated if I follow everyone's advice 
and replace the video card for xmas.

Splendid
