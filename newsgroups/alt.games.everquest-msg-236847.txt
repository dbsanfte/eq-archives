Thanks for the info.  I thought it was something funky like a bump at 3
wins, then a bump at 30 wins, then who knows.  I made an effort to hail all
the correct NPC's and got my stone where it should be after getting stuck at
+8 hp/mana.  Now my stone is right where it should be based on the every 10
wins formula - +2 to all stats and +22 hp/mana.
