It doesn't have anything (well, much) to do with the video card, it has to 
do with the monitor. The monitor takes a certain amount of time to detect a 
frequency shift from the video card. My new monitor takes more time to do 
this than my previous one. Same video card. It was annoying with the old 
monitor, it's intollerable with the new one.

Yah, I did this, it is also pretty annoying. But you're right, it's better 
than swapping resolutions back and forth. 

Can someone with Velious explain what's been changed to make this even 
better?

Thanks to all for the replies.
