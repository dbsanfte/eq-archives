Hi There

I really wish I hadn't totally destroyed my Gnome Rogue from Sullen Zek. 
But I was so fed up and frustrated trying to play him. That I wiped all 
the files when I transferred EQ to it's own private partition on my Hard 
Drive.

The posting on the 'This Guy Gets it' prompted my first recollections of 
this debacle . Then seeing this about 'The Fallen' got me to thinking 
about a bit more.

So here is my full memory of my one and only attempt at playing on a PvP 
server.

I thought I would try Sullen Zek after about a month of playing EQ so 
that puts it around April 2002. I thought how hard could it be. I had 
got an enchanter to 8th level <grin> (Not so famous last words)

SO I created a Gnome Rogue and after all was accepted, the screen goes 
blank the music plays I arrive.

I see (The name stuck in memory. The rest of the wording is my 
recollection. I think it might have been similar to what Clerics seem to 
say a lot. The damage xx was definitely double figures but I cannot 
remember if it was in the teens or twenties)

Camel_Breath Bellows' loudly

You start to shake. You Take xx damage.

You are unconscious. (Screen goes to top view and freezes)

You start to shake you take xx damage.

You die

Please wait returning to Home (Screen goes blank)

Arrive back. Repeat above.

Typed /camp. But of course all that happens is you stand up when 
attacked.

Dove into the minuscule manual looking for that 'Other' command your not 
supposed to use.

Found /quit in the book.

By the time the server accepted it I had died at least 6 times.

My only other memory of that disaster was. Ak' Anon seemed to be a very 
dark place and when in the overhead shot, all the bodies (There were a 
lot of others there) looked like a Politicians rosette or a pack of 
cards fanned out around a central point.

I was so disgusted it was several months later before I tried again.

This time I was surprise that I arrived in Steamfont instead of Ak 
'Anon.

---------------------- Insert From Previous 'He Gets it' posting to save 
a lot of retyping.--------------------

It's later on finding that one 30th level Ranger is using track to hunt 
and kill all those under 10 in the zone. Multiple times until those 
being hunted get fed up and leave. Bitching all the time that we are 
skinflints for not carrying tons of platinum. Then uses really foul 
language as everyone leaves 'For not playing the game'

It was the same high level characters killing NPC's that drop specific 
items for the newbie armour quests. So as to slow our ability to able to 
get the items for our starting armour then bragging about how it would 
keep us easier to kill for longer. They then killed the group I was in.

It was the only time I damaged an opponent. 6 characters average level 
5. We got one of our 2 attackers to 50% hit points before the last of us 
died. Another of their buddies was at the spawn point casting choke to 
stop us trying to rejoin the fight.

In the 1 week I tried a PvP server I was killed 82 times by Characters 
and 6 by NPC's. The lowest "opponent" I had was 23 the highest was 48 I 
was also killed by an (Anonymous) who threw a spell that took 60 points 
off at 1st hit then 55 per tick. I lasted 3 rounds.

So what was I. Was I an evil ogre being hunted by good characters. Well 
I was a Gnome Rogue being hunted by mainly elves and humans. I got to 
level 9 before I deleted him.

The final straw was 19 straight deaths in 1.5 hours of play.

What I saw on those servers were mainly a bunch of puerile retards who 
thought it was extremely funny to try and build a larger pile of dead 
1st level characters faster than the characters could /quit.

Humm!

Thinking about it more. Apart from the episode in Ak ' Anon. I think I 
had got to at least level 5 by the time the rest of above happened as I 
remember trying to hide and sneak out of trouble only to be chased down 
and hit. (Thinking at the time. What is the use of  being able to hide 
if players can still hit you)

If  I remember correctly those are skills you only got after going up a 
couple of levels

Anyway as far as I am concerned, the police should keep an eye of anyone 
who is on those PvP servers as they all seemed to be prime candidates 
for going to prison for anti-social behaviour at the bare minimum.

Yours
