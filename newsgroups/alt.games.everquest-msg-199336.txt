Hi... I have a lvl 37 Mage on Fennin Ro as well as a few other alts and my
main... a 56 (soon to be 57) Shammy.  I haven't played my Mage in almost a
year now.  He is human and I was lvl'n him in FV killing spiders when I
started a Shammy just because I was tired of trying to lvl him and a bit
bored.  A few months back I raided his gear when I decided to make a Wiz to
use as my Shammys personal taxi service (I'm a 2 boxer).  Seven days ago
(Hmm... 8 now :)....) I started a Barbarian Rogue who just today dinged 46
and 47 Tues.... yes hes supper tweeked and my wife who has a 56 Druid helped
by playing him while I was at work a couple days too.  I haven't deleated
the Mage and in fact I will pull him out, dust him off, re-equip him and
play him again someday.  But I wouldn't consider a Mage as a main even
though they do have their advantages.

Yes, since the Wiz's have been pretty muched nurfed out of existance the
Mage is probably the king of damage these days and can summon all kinds of
stuff.  Unfortunatly the "stuff" they summon is of little use to high end
players and while their pets can handle mobs up to around the mid to high
40's they can't begin to tank mobs in the really tough dungons like KC and
Sol B without a LOT of supporting help.  Forget about even the earth pet
tanking in places like PoI, PoN etc... since these mobs hit for 300+ a wack
it dosn't take many hits to kill even a pretty well tweeked Warrior there if
their AC isn't VERY high!  Necros can fear kite with their pets in such
places but I don't believe even they can do it solo, at least I've not seen
that in the 2 or so months I've been occassionally playing in PoP.  I tried
taking on a raven in PoN with my Shammy and Wiz just to see if it could be
done.  It couldn't!  The mob killed my pet just before I had it half way
dead and remember, it was slowed with a lvl 56 Shammy slow too!  I kept
healing the pet for 650 a heal and was just about out of mana when the pet
bit the dust.  The pet has around 1900 HP's with HOS and other Shammy buffs
and AC around a level 35/36/37 player and does about half the dmg of an
average melee.  When you consider the 3900 HP's from about 6 or 7 heals that
means the pet was hit for about 5700 to 5800 dmg!  I kept the mob rooted
right up until it was at one bubble of health, even after the pet died,
while my Wiz nuked the crap out of it...  perhaps 5 Ice Comets at 1120 dmg a
pop (only 2 cast resulted in lower dmg)... and my Shammy hit it with a 1720
dmg. 45sec. dot but all of a sudden at one bubble of health left the mob
became totally imune to my root and killed my tweeked Wiz in about 20
secs... Wiz has about 1600 HP's with Shammy buffs plus a 600 dmg absorbing
sheild!  I got my Shammy out OK but he had sow and took about 3 bubbles of
dmg total too!

The short of all the above is...  while you'll be able to solo most mobs
even in places like DL after 44, you won't have a prayer even in places like
KC let alone PoP!  Remember, I slow mobs for up to 60% and haste for 50% and
I couldn't do PoN with a Wiz along for nuking.  So you'll need to group if
you want to lvl up your Mage beyond about 56/57...  Oh you can go to OOT and
do Seafurys at about 48/49 but by 55 the exp is sooooooo slow you'll be rich
from the loot but bored to tears.  After OOT its either the highest dungons
like Sol B etc. or PoP I'm afraid and that means being in a group.  A well
balanced group too!

Thats a though for sure.  It depends on how high you want to lvl your Mage
and how long your willing to take to do it.  If you want to someday have a
lvl 65 character and don't care if it takes even up to 2 more years then
stick with the Mage.  If you'd like to have a 60 to 65 main in a much more
reasonable time frame make either a Shammy, Claric or tank.  These are
probably the most sought after classes at the highest end of the game but
more experienced PoP'ers might know differently... I've only played in PoI,
PoN and PoD to date and not more than two dozen times at most.  Once I get
my Rogue to 50/51 I'll play him with my Shammy (remember I'm a 2 boxer), my
wifes Druid and a friend at works Claric pretty much exclusively since I'm
tired of the lfg hassels endemic with EQ.... you know, Ding, Gratz, Sorry
but I have to log, thanks for the group, bye!  That really sucks in PoP
since it takes a balanced group up there.

I'd say the Shaman is your best bet but I'm really not familiar with the Vah
Shir.  I do know Barbarians make great Shammys, Warriors and Rogues because
of their size/strength/etc. and their not KOS like Orges so their eaiser to
play.  I scrapped a human Necro at 24 because of being KOS and all the
research crap I'd have to do to get pets at higher levels.  And believe me,
a Shammy is terrific at PL'n other charaters.  Got my Wiz to 53 in just 33
days time with just over 5 days of playing time and as I've said I've gotten
my Rogue to 47 in 8 days real time.. don't know the days/hours played off
hand but I'd guess its around 2 1/2 or so.

Good luck
