Well, obviously <my> writing skills are not up to Twain's standard.
The "offensive" comment was intended to make it clear that I and not
you determine what is offensive to me, just as you and not I determine
what is offensive to you.  This then implies that neither of us is in
a position to dictate how our behavior will be received, and from that
follows the point that making your "speech" difficult to understand as
part of your roleplay is rude to your groupmates, unless of course
they accept/approve.  It's not your place to dictate what others find
acceptable.

Your tone was aggressive, but you engaged my post directly, so I
did not take it as a flame per se.  I did notice the similarity
to one of my posting styles.  I also noticed that you made your
points clearly, which highlighted the miscommunication.  So I
tried to clear things up rather than ranting at you.

Hey, no fair!  I was there first!  :-p

*shrug*  If that's what you got from reading I obviously didn't do a
very good job of writing it.  If anything I motivated by irritation
at the "elitism" exhibited by some fraction of the "RP" crowd, which
mirrors the "1337-ism" of the dudes.

I've been in such groups from time to time, and bumbled along as best
I could.  But it's more work than play to me (I'm no actor) and I've
no doubt the others could tell that my heart wasn't really in it.  At
any rate, with a few exceptions neither the RP'ers nor I have sought
each other out subsequently and the RP'ers on Tunare at least seem to
be something of a secret society (i.e. they avoid calling attention to
themselves, tho I hear they still exist).

Poorly written by me.  Should have written something like "I don't
invite people I haven't talked to into groups, I'm not one of those
who invites anybody they see into a group without even bothering to
say hello first".

Well, I pretty much agree with everything here, except the part about
me not agreeing.

Neither of us is likely ever to hold a candle to James Fennimore Cooper
in that regard.
