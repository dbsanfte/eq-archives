The simple solution would be to have them all post something on this 
newsgroup.  Then they'd technically be AGE people, and that should be 
the end of any complaints about their provenance.

As if most of us would even consider complaining.

At this point in the life of Usenet, we'd make up a pretty small guild 
if all the current posters got together.  Of course there may be ten 
times as many lurkers, but then again there may not.

Last time we tried this, to my knowledge, it started out pretty well, 
but gradually the wildly varied commitment level of the people involved 
meant the guild spread out over a wide range of levels and just 
gradually ground down to a halt.

If you have a core of 6 people who already have a history of working and 
playing well together, I think that would be a serious advantage; 
instead of everyone moving at our own pace, we'd probably end up 
matching your pace to some extent.  Anyone playing a -lot- more than you 
could start an alt to play that game with, anyone moving a lot slower, 
perhaps might get some PLing, or might just get left behind as far as 
grouping and so on goes, with the expectation that as things slow down 
as we get up in level and perhaps start raiding, they'd probably catch up.
