The trouble however is that while an argument that the 'brains' may 
deserve 'advanced rewards'... there is nothing particularly special 
about the 'brawn'; except that they are there, and can be there whenver 
and as often as needed.

Why make a game that rewards 'the brawn' over other equally (or even 
more) competent players so much more?
