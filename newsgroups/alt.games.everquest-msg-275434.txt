Define "Blizzard" - it seems to me it's just a name, now. The
employees who made Blizzard a successful company are all gone.
Replaced by random new hires.

Of the cartoon game? I saw a bunch down at Target a day or two ago.
You act like the game is in demand or something :p

Define SOE :D

Chief Creative Officer at SOE is Raph Koster. He was hired more than 2
years after Everquest came out. I'm pretty sure NONE of the original
Everquest development crew remains at SOE. A better question is "what
kind of Everquest sequel did you expect from a bunch of random new
hires who had nothing to do with Everquest?" - but the best question
of all is "Why on earth are you playing such a bad game?" - that's the
question I'd ask him. Because it is, really, a very bad game. On a
scale of 1 to 10 where watching grass grow is a 10, Everquest 2 is
about a three. Just ahead of getting a root canal. Reading National
Enquirer while taking a shit is about a 15 on that scale.

And speaking of KOTOR 2, is anyone else as annoyed with being forced
to drive the shitheel characters you got saddled with, like it or not?
I just completed one quest where I had to drive the gimp pilot, the
gimp wookie (I REALLY hate the fucking wookies, I hate everything
about em, why do I have to play one to play this game?) the Mira
character who seemed interesting but then got killed in a scripted
fashion, and the robot. This is not fun. It might be fun if I got to
CHOOSE which characters to add to my "crew" - or even if I got to
CHOOSE which ones of them I had to play during these subplots. But
being made to play charcters I disliked enough that I sold their gear
and auto-levelled them and left them on the ship from the time they
"joined" me is a bother. Also, because they got no gear and poor
skills (the auto-levelling sheme is pretty inane) I have to put the
difficulty setting on easy, from difficult where I normally have it.

I dunno. It seems like it was a good idea, but the lack of player
input is frustrating. It's good to be able to leave my big hipped
homosexual badly dressed superhuman jedi behind once in a while, in
order to make the game seem at least remotely challenging, but I'd
rather have it be a more consensual thing. I'd prefer they got rid of
the solo MODE, which works really badly, and put in actual solo PLAY,
where you could pick whichever character was best suited to the task
at hand and play that section of the game with that character. In
fact, I wouldn't mind it a bit if the whole game worked that way. Play
characters one at a time. Period.

Because, The AI, the pathfinding, the targetting, the combat system,
and everything else in the KOTOR game engine is pretty fucking
pathetic when it comes to multi-character teams. Previous Bioware
games like Baldur's Gate 2 were not perfect in this regard, but they
were a HELLUVA lot better than this. The KOTOR engine is a prime
example of what happens when you try to make a game console do things
it wasn't designed to do. You end up with a shitass implementation.
And that's why Bioware deserves to die a horrible death for selling
out teh PC game industry and making their new products for game
consoles. It takes 5 minutes playing KOTOR to find a laundry list of
things that could have been done better, if they didn't have to be
made to work on a console. Bastards. Really, they are. I though the
big step down they took when they made Neverwinter Nights was just a
brain fart, but it was Bioware flushing it's develoment credentials
down the toilet. They will be forever known as the company that made
the Baldur's Gate games and that's all. Just liek Origin is known as
the company that made the Wing Commander and Ultima games, New World
Computing the Might & Magic games and  Sirtech the Wizardry and Jagged
Alliance games. 

Although, most gamers today don't even know that Origin, NWC, and
Sirtech were even game companies. Interplay is best known for making
the Fallout (and Torment) games in the 90s, Wasteland and Bards Tale
in the 80s. Interplay is gone and forgotten now too. But Obsidian, who
made KOTOR 2, is comprised of some of the people who made Fallout and
Torment. For that reason, I hope that KOTOR 2 is a big success. And in
fairness to Obsidian, they did some great things with the shitass
engine they were saddled with. They did more, and better, with the
KOTOR engine than Bioware did. Go, Obsidian! Die, Bioware.
