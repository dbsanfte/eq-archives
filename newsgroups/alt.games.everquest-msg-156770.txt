Pretty standard fare by the sound of it. If they make an expansion which
only benefits 60+ then all the players who have no design or ability to
reach the 60's have no reason to buy.

Didn't they do a similar thing adding a new UI to Velious, and a lot of the
people who got the update didn't have high enough characters but wanted the
interface?

Hmmn - my memory is fuzzy...
