...adn the majority of players worth having in a guild, yes. "Random"
recruiting more often than not ends up with a guild full of 133t
d00dz, not to mention being tacky. Generally, you'll find the better
candidates come to you, you don't have to go to them. Random
recruiting puts forth the image that you're worried about quantity
over quality, which has the potential of killing a guild...
