: Everquest.

Totally different, be preparred. EQ is much much much much harder than diablo.
And it takes AEONS more time to get to the best level, and if you're there,
it takes another AEON to egt all the good items, that make an uber level 60
much stronger than a 'newbie' level 60.

: Questions as to the difference :
: - can you mule in Everquest ?

You have 8 (?) characters per account .. so you can create a mule character if you want.
Maximum containers is 10 slot. I don't recall how many slots the bank has ... can fit
8 bags I think .. the personal inventory is 10 bags.

: - how many accounts can you have ?

Don't know .. as many as you want. But you have to buy the full software and pay the
monthly fee for every single account.

: - is pvp possible ?

Yes, on PvP Servers. Not on carebear servers. (well in theroy, but never seen
apart from duels)

: - is it full of dupes and hacks already ?

Nope, not a single one. Apart from some bugs within the game. Nothing allows anyone
to get good items etc or so through a hack, though. The game will be very hard, whatever
you 'hack'. Unless you have alot of level 60 friends powerlevelling you :)
Don't even START to ask within game .. you'll be ignored and alone very fast.

: - is it possible to solo ?

Yes, some classes are soloable. Some are not. Necromancers, Druids, Shamen and
a few others solo more or less well. This is a debate though. Some classes
can't solo at all, like Warriors.

: - are there persons in the game who can kick/ban you / censor what you say etc.

Yes. The GM's. You can /petition things .. which puts you on a waiting list with
them and they'll get back to you. You can report badmouthers (sort of lame),
KS (KillSteal) etc .. even if you don't like somebody's name.

: - do you have a stash /how big is the inv (compared to diablo 2 exp) ?

Comparable. With bags I'd say you can carry more, sicne every EQ item is
the same size in an inv slot (different item 'sizes' though .. som bags can
only hold 'small' items).

: Thanks.
