Yes, Cantata of Soothing is a Velious song, level 34, it works like Hymn,
with a heal buff icon, and gives both HP and mana while up.  Won't stack
with Hymn or the higher level Cantata, or with other bards singing any of
the above.  Since its a buff type song, though, it lasts 3 tics, giving you
the opportunity to twist it in instead of using just this song to maximize
mana output.  It also requires a string in hand to sing, thus forcing some
equipment juggling (unless you have your epic)

Later, you get Cantata of Replentishment, which is the same song, only much
more effective.  Then there's a higher level one yet, basically the same
song but AE instead of group only, so it hits all players in range.  Great
for raids, also great for getting you killed, apparantly (my bard is still a
level short of seeing this one)

At any rate, if your bard is level 34 or above, have someone get this song
for you, it only costs about 3pp and is droppable; you can buy it off the
gnome pirates in Iceclad or in the cleric guild in Thurgadin, most players
should know where these vendors are and be able to go get the spells safely
even with level one alts (Iceclad one would take a boat ride but require
only Velious, while Thurg one would require owning POP so as to book down...
at least to do so as an utterly trivial exercise)

Fantastic spell line, since it means no longer having to chose mana or heal;
while its a bit less than either, its decent and you can turn it on and
leave it on without overwhelming guilt in down time.
