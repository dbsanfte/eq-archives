LOL!

I do spend a coulpe of hours each night playing EQ, but nothing near
the amount of time needed to play at the level seen in those stats. I
am not knocking people that put in the time and effort. I am merely
asking if it really is worth it (rhetorically). In the end the only
important thing is that each player enjoys themselves and doesn't let
EQ totally take over thier lives.
