Warriors get it at thirteen. Rogues too. I believe a couple others.
(Maybe rangers but not SKs? Not sure about Pallies)

Doesn't matter. As long as the weapon is usable by your class/race and
it's listed as equippable in that slot, you're good to go. (Some will
say primary only, or secondary only, others will be either melee.)

Keep your H2H maxed at all levels. You'll see all the twinks running
around with two 1HB weapons (CoT, etc.) but the ones who don't keep up
the H2H will likely regret it in the end game when your fists become the
most lethal weapons you can have. (Ok... there's probably uberloot
that's better, but unobtainable to 99% of us. Besides, if you're naked
on a CR you want to be able to take on whatever jumps you on your way
back to the corpse. Monks are about the only melee type that can make
that claim to fame.)
