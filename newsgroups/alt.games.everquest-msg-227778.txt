I don't think so.  Being an 'Officer' or a 'Guild Leader' in EQ means
little and it certainly doesn't mean you are qualified to do ANYTHING.

Bias is a common (universal?) human failing which is why officer
award, loot councils etc don't work.  People are never impartial and
those who THINK they are impartial most definitely are not unless they
are operating from a distinct set of rules, which is just DKP without
the fun part (being able to decide where and how to upgrade YOUR
character).
