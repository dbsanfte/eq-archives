Pretty much, except that one requirement is that the group(s)
have the ability to kill the mob.  A sand giant chasing a
group of level 14s in Oasis isn't engaged;  that same hill
giant chasing a group of 35s is.

Not really.  You can't fight a mob that another group is
fighting, including during the pull.  Someone "kiting" the
mob who can't kill it isn't "fighting" it.

So?  Why pull one or two or three at a time if they can
pull more?  Some groups pull 30 or more mobs at a time (that
are blue to all of the group) and can handle them perfectly
well...
