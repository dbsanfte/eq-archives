Verant has trouble just making npcs dynamic and random, let alone zone
changes like zone ins and outs. Zones are perm as far as geometry and
entrace/exits. Even when they changed the mobs in cazic thule, its
still the same old zone. They could probably do something like that in
a planes of power zone if they felt like it but I'd not suggest it
since it would just make getting into a zone more laborious (lets bump
around until we find the entrance, come on 57 people lets go!)
