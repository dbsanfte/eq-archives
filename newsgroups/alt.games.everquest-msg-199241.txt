OTOH, 25 extra STA means a lot to a "meer (sic) mortal".  Kaev, my Half
Elf Paladin, put his 20 extra points into WIS and AGI, where they have
done him little good.  I had a bitch of a time getting his STA over 100
when I first learned about that necessity, and even now He has had STA
over 200 exactly once (and probably never will again as I stopped
playing him).  If I had done the sensible thing and put those 20 points
into STA (rasing his base to a whopping 95) he would have approximately
90 more HP at L55, not a huge difference, but enough to matter.

Hmmm, it sure looks to me as if I agreed with you about raiders.  You
taking a page out of DT's book here?
