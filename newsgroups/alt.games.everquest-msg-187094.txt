While I don't care for trolling emails, a lot of the off topic posts are
really fascinating.  The ability of A.G.E. to enjoy OT subjects and not
censor anything is part of why I still enjoy myself here, so...well...I'm

whatever you damned well want to talk about.  Even if I don't agree with
half of what I read, I enjoy the experience.
