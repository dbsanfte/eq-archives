Oasis? And kill luggage? No way, Jose.

Go to Ill Omen and fight near the windmill,solo or group. Plenty of
critters, many of which drop those weird-looking swords which sell for 1-2
platinum each. My warrior went from 16-22 in 3 days there (grouped with my
druid, who is 3 levels behind him), and I only play 3-4 hours a day.

Plus, no sand giants and spectres. Also, no faction problems and there's a
guy to sell to *INSIDE* the windmill -- a rogue dwarf (or is that dwarf
rogue?).

Downside is, LOIO is often crowded as heck (105 people yesterday on Povar),
but the zone is huge so you won't run out of room. When you hit 20-22 move
to the shore for fast experience and more plat (the Sarnaks often drop 1-3
plat each), then head to the back of the fort at about 25 and keep up the
mayhem. Went from 16-30 there in about two weeks, and I work during prime
time.

Also, if you can bored, you can hut the goblin caves or try to get a group
to go inside the fort and take out the chancellor, all of which is doable
from 25-30 with the right people.
