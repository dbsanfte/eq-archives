Since we were talking about it here, I decided to go look on the Sony
boards in the bug reporting section for any information on the mystery
of the missing gnolls. Sure enough, on June 20th, Esther the Tester
posted a letter from somebody wondering where, oh where, had the little
gnolls gone?

Her response was that she had somebody "looking into it today". No
followup on that yet.  Watch this space.
