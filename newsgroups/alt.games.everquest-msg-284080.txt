Hi all,

I just started messing with some shroud forms.  I know a bit late, but
I have a hard enough time working my own toon...hehe.

Question: If you play a 70th character, with a 20th level shroud (to
help friends in say SoNH, what exp can you expect on the 70 toon after
you unshroud?

Question: If you have 100% of you exp going to AA's going into the
shroud, will you get all you shroud experience in AA's?

Any other EXP info, like tips on how to maximizer the gain would be
helpful.

Thanks all,

Gilmere, 70th WAR EMarr
