Druzzil Ro:

The 2 main characters, the 67 CLR and the 70 RNG are decked out.  Both have 
Time flags and most of qvic.  Both have epic 1.0.    They also each have the 
first 4 veteren AAs, including the free rez.  Not sure what else to put :P

If you have any questions, please email me.  I would be more then happy to 
answer them.
