I have just returned to EQ after about a 8 month absence.  I just
reactivated my account today and am trying to get back up to speed.  I plan
on creating a new character on the Ayonae Ro server to be with some friends.
Any recommendations on whats a good class these days, and I've heard they've
done away with the experience penalties that some classes had, is this true?
Do some races still have exp penalties?  Thanks for the help
