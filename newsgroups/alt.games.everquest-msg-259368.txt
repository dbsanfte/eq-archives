Yep, shaman have alot more solo options than alot of classes, runners are
the main problem.

Was exping in HoH with my shaman today, was pretty tough (well not tough,
just annoying), root breaks, have to peg it, re root hope it dont hit ya
etc.

Then my bro joined with his druid....snare made the camp totally gimp :)

Snare on a shaman would be nice, but as you have noticed, a bit too nice :)
