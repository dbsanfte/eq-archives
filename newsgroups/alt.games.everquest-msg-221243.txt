Little or none, part of the "gear for all plate classes" itemization.
I am not certain of this, but I've heard it said that there is a slight
edge to Warriors in mitigation.  Remember, the displayed AC you see is
not all that tightly tied to your actual ability to take a hit, it's a
way to show damage and mitigation as a single number.  On top of that,
mitigation is handled differently between the classes.  For example,
Clerics and Bards get hit as hard as chain classes, despite their shiny
plate armor, an AC 1000 Warrior is much tougher than an AC 1000 Cleric,
even if they have identical HP.  Likewise, Monks are supposed to get
hit less often, unfortunately they now mitigate almost as badly as the
robes.  For your second question, I agree that Warriors should take
hits better than anybody.  Whether that should be handled strictly via
HP, with Warrior/knight armor protection identical, or by HP plus a
small edge in armor protection is unimportant to me, the key is that
the edge should be noticeable but not too large in XP situations (else
knights are marginalized) and sufficiently clear to keep Warriors as
the primo raid tank.  /disc defensive goes a long way toward assuring
this last, but there are reports from endgame raiders, including Furor
who's opinion and observations are well worth noting despite my low
opinion of him :-p, that the line between Warriors and knights as
raid tanks is blurring.  I don't play the raid game tho, so my main
interest is in seeing casual Warriors brought up on par with knights
without breaking knights in the process.  I'll let the high end players
speak to their own issues.

Yes, but it's not a trivial task, and balancing the endgame and the
"casual" game makes it even trickier.  That's my big concern, that
SOE will "fix" the endgame and just leave the rest of us to sort it
out (that is their usual approach), with small odds that whatever
they do to the endgame will give good results for the rest of us.
They aded long lasting buffs (KEI in particular) in response to
raider complaints about the hassle of buffing/rebuffing raid forces
and look what that did to the casual game, as an example.

If knights are nerfed without fixing Warriors then all the plate tanks
will be sitting on the sidelines.

Actually, the HP total is more important than you are letting on, and
although some Warriors complain about defensive, it is by all accounts
crucial for a number of encounters.  But you're right, Warriors need
more than HP, auto-attack, taunt, and defensive.  If you look on page
7 of the PoN thread I linked you'll find a very interesting suggestion.

The endgamers are bitching too.  In fact, they're probably bitching the
loudest.  SOE needs to do something.  Sadly, they'll likely screw it up.
