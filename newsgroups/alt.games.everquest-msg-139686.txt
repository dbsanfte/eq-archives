Just the RNG hasn't gotten around to it yet.

Evade is really nothing different...just a new check
on an old skill.  To Evade, you have to be "out" of
combat already (no longer auto-attacking).  Therefore,
Evade is just a simple Hide with a new check routine
for rogues.

You CAN skill up Hide while Evading in combat.
