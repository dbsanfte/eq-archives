Just went thru the nexus on Karana.  There was around 50+ corpses of some
guy named 'Selindorf' laying around.  As I watched, he popped back in and
promptly died.  Couldn't tell thru all the crackheads if someone nailed him
with a spell or not.  There was a trail of 10 or more bodies leading back to
the bazaar.

The OOC chatter had it that it was either a PO'd girlfriend or someone's
little brother.
