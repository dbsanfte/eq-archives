Seems on most servers, EC is the major auction zone.  But I've been playing
on Saryn for the last few days, and man, is NFreeport on Saryn a circus!!
Especially the Merchant's square outside the bank.  More auctioning there
than in EC!  Add in all the spell casting and gladiatorial guard killing,
and NFP on Saryn is a very entertaining place.
