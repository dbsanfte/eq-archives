No, they need to be equipped in your primary hand while practicing the 
tradeskill.

No, they are player made using the Tinkering skill.  You can usually find 
them for sale in the Bazaar.

You could, if you are a gnome and your tinkering is high enough.

Yes.

They are not placed in the container, so the question is moot.

A geerlock will raise your effective skill level by 5% for purposes of 
determining if a combine is successful.  They will not have a direct effect 
on getting skillups in the skill, but, many argue that you are more likely 
to skillup on a success than a failure, so, they would indirectely affect 
your skillup rate in that fashion.  The tradeoff is that you lose the stats 
from whatever you normally equip in your main hand while holding the 
geerlock.

You are correct.  Halflings get great cultural tailoring, so that would be 
one to consider, however, it's a very painful one to raise over 200.  Other 
than that, whatever tradeskill looks to be the most fun to you.  If you 
can't practice cultural tradeskilling in your chosen one, some of the 
others still provide means of making money.

It is said that the best way to make a small fortune in EQ is to start with 
a large fortune, and learn tradeskills.

It is possible to make decent (very good actually) money with tradeskills, 
if you have the perserverance (sp?) to raise your skill level to close to 
250.  For halflings, they get some nice tailoring that only halflings can 
make.  I would check www.eqtraders.com for information on the various 
tradeskills.  Most of them are very difficult to raise to grandmaster 
level, and quite expensive to do that as well.  Most require you to farm 
tedious amounts of drops from green to you mobs, or pay through the nose to 
other players that do take the time to do the farming.  There are 
exceptions, some tradeskills can go to 250 purely on vendor purchased 
components, Fletching and Jewelcrafting are the two that come to mind off 
hand.
