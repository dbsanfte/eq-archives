I did say in general.  There were specific Celerons that compared quite 
favorably to the Pentiums available at the time.

No question that the video card, and also the system ram makes a huge 
difference, often much more of a difference than the cpu.

With slower CPUs you will run into the issue of not being able to really 
take advantage of the better video cards, as the CPUs are just too slow.  
Generally, you want a 1GHz+ processor for the current high end graphics 
cards.
