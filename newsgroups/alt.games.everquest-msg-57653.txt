It is a very odd problem. Whenever I log in (Netherlands) I get a ping of
60-120 and 0.0% packet loss all the time, but a friend who moved with me
from Vazaelle (also Dutch) is getting major pl and occasional disconnects.
As best as I can tell about 70% of the players are having heavy pl and
disconnects.

A system-wide message a couple of days ago said VI knows there are some
router problems and they're trying to fix it.
