Vilias is a 45% spell haste.  It will stack with item hastes, but not
with other spell hastes.  Battlecry is a 15% stacking haste.  This is
a new (Luclin-era) type of haste, basically it not only stacks with
spell hastes (from bard, enchanter, shaman, or clicky-effect items),
it raises the hard cap on haste.  The upgraded version is a 25%
stacking haste.  
The only time a bard is only singing one haste song is when someone
else is providing the haste (shammy/chanter).  The stacking haste
songs are bugged though.  If you have a group member who doesn't have
a haste item, and you don't provide a haste spell for them, the
stacking haste acts as a really nasty slow.  
Slight sidebar--In pick-up groups I now twist McVaxius (good battle
song, atk, str, damage shield, low haste) with Warcry, so that the odd
tank without a haste item doesn't stand around swinging about once
every 4 seconds.  I generally relied on my epic proc to supply the
spell haste, but the one time I experienced the bug (CR gear because
we all have stylish sets in the bank, and hadn't CR'd HS in forever)
made me sorry for getting annoyed at the whining tanks.

Yep, considering that the two songs your bard was singing added 15%
and 45% to the melee damage output.  That's 60% more melee damage, on
every mob.  That means you kill every mob faster, which means less
healing, more mana, and less downtime.  Of course you should through
that all away so that your ranger is able to get his AGI up another 25
points.

I'd just tell the ranger to tank and leave him dead  :)
