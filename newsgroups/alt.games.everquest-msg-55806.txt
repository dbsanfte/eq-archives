Ok, I don't know what happened here.  Last night, I run through NR to the
dock with Frankel the Pirate standing there.  There are several people
waiting for the boat to Iceclad Ocean.  I'm on way to Thurgadin, so I wait
with them...Frankel announces that the boat is coming five times in the
three hours that we waited, but no boat ever came...

Anyone know what's going on?

Thanks,
