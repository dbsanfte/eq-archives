Twinking is a form of PLing.  It's just a matter of Passive PLing vs.
Aggressive PLing.

Anytime that a character gets help 'beyond reasonable measures', it's PLing.
That would include items well beyond their level's grasp (ie I, personally,
wouldn't consider banded on a lowbie to be twinking but a Fungi, yes),
uber-buffs, etc.  It would not include grouping with (and not being
watchdogged by) someone a couple of levels higher.

There's not really much difference between an ongoing buff from a druid of,
say, 200 ac, and getting a constant 200 AC from twinked items, is there?
