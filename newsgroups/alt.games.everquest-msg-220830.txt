Actually, that can be explained. 1st off, England doesn't have the
inner city gang problems that we have. Or at least they didn't.
They've been making up ground lately. Most murder in the US is gang
and drug related. That's a proven fact. Take the gang related murder
out of the picture in the US, and we have a lower murder rate than
most European countries. PLUS, the rate in England is growing, while
the murder rate in the US has been at a steady decline. Finally, the
murder rate is highest in states where gun ownership is banned. For
example: In the 1st 90 days of Iraqi occupation, 52 people were killed
who were from the US> (Not all died in combat either... some were
accidents). In the same amount of time, 66 people were murdere in
Washington DC> Washington DC has one of the most draconian Gun bans in
the country! Same with New York, LA, and Chicago, the places with the
worst gang issues in the country. 

As for rape, the rate is actually higher in England. Look it up.
