Nah - Cat's have more class : )

There is a quick pet IQ test you can use to show this. Just fart with a cat
on your lap - they're ears will lower and they will try to put up with it
briefly before running off disgusted. Do the same thing with a dog and they
will sniff the air in ectasy and look lovingly in your eyes hoping for more.
