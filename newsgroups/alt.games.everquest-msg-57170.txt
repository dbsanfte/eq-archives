Yes, yes, let's hear the tired old arguement that anyone who argues that
people who whine about downtime are whiners are unconcerned about the
product or are elitist NG "in crowd" hypocrates[sic].

>Perhaps my view point comes from working in the real world. 

Yes, let's go to the "real world" because San Diego is located 3 zones
south of Qeynos, last I checked.

Patches on everquest "usually" go smooth and by the numbers. Why? Because
15 hours downtime (like yesterday) isn't tolerated in the everquest
business world.

I'll take careful note of the fact that BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION, "real world"
network patches *CAN* go unsmoothly and by the letters, and take 15 hours
to accomplish. The "usual" everquest patch does NOT have these problems.
Morons like yourself simply blow them far out of proportion when they do
occur. Do they occur more often than your so-called "real world" networks?
Probably. Is everquest designed for somewhere in the area of 1000 times the
number of users, with easily 1000 times more complexity? Why yes, it
sure-fire is! Would it be a simple logic step to assume that something more
complicated has more ways that it can go wrong? Don't burst a vessel in
your brain trying to comprehend that concept.

Funny, when Win95 came out, it had a small and insignificant bug where
attempting to run any MS-DOS based program would hang the OS and force a
reboot. As I recall, this took 5 months to be fixed and patched. But
thankfully, that didn't take place in the "real world" where everything
goes just like it was planned, and programmers, testers, and debuggers are
faultless individuals who can chase through a million lines of code, find,
and fix an error in under 10 minutes.
