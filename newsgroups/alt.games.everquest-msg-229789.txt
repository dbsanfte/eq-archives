Now I will resort to a comment here you are a liar Ben Sisson who flouts the
news group "netiquette" to suit himself .. typical of a pre-pubescent who
really has no scruples or idea of what happens in the real world.

You have made no comment about my post to Lance about the 10 Commandments of
news group etiquette because you know you cannot defend yourself ... you are
worst than the top posters you denigrate.

I posted my newsgroup list fully knowing that you and others would check
them .. they are majority top posting ... I accept that not all newsgroups
are top posting .. that has never been my contention .. refer back to my
original post to Lance.

Feel free to plonk me ... a pre-pubsecent would do that next.
