Yes, I know I can find this information by searching bard boards and even
a google search on this NG, but have pity on me...I'm trying to be good
and not browse online while at work.

It has been said that bards are not ideal tanks.  However, the same is
said of rangers, and I've been bootstrapping it just fine for 65 levels
(albeit with a pocket shaman).  

Where does a bard rank in terms of HP/mitigation compared to a ranger?  I
recollect hearing that they do have fewer HP than rangers, but that could
be completely wrong.  I also suspect that they have better mitigation as a
plate class (and of course have higher AC armor available to them),
although probably not as good avoidance as I do.

Also, high level bard slow song...obviously tanking and being the slower
at the same time would provide some real gotchas if mobs like to stun a
lot...but I'm curious how many seconds the song lasts after you stop
singing it. IE, is it possible to recover the song after a stun?

In the big picture I suspect these two would group more often than our
current team, simply because we're finaly starting to make friends that we
*like* grouping with.  But I'm still curious to know where a bard really
stacks up.
