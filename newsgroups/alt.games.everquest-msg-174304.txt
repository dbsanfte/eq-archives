This is where you just miss it all completely. If they use their weapons of
mass destruction in battle then loss of life and effect of them will be as
absolutely minimized as possible. May those we have in harms way be really
competent those days. If he dosent have them yet (proof is he does btw) then
you will erradicate a threat right before it became significantly harder. We
actually dont care much about the biological weapons of mass destruction but
nuclear ones are directly usefull on the battlefield and he must be stopped
from acquiring them. The biological ones are only usefull against
noncombatants ie New York or LA. Stopping him now is a win/win if you fear
his actions in the future.

That is the point though that we disagree on methinks . Quite a number of
people beleive that he poses no direct threat to the US. They do not believe
he will distribute weapons of mass destruction to terrorists to curry favor
in the Islamic world. They do not beleive that he will once again try and
conquer the entire Arab world thus becomming Mr big cheese in that area. I
sorta think these naysayers are wrong on both accounts but am not at all
sure about it. Personally I think it should have been handled by
assasination.

You keep bringing up the point that it is all about oil . I will just once
like to point out that 60% of the people in the US beleive that it has
something to do with oil and that 80% approve of the action anyway. Since
the left advocates theft of the rich in this country, invoking the mantra of
moral relativism on such shaky grounds as the rich might possibly not have
earned all that they have and just might possibly have gotten lucky somehow,
this is not at all suprising when considering such a target as a known
despot, murder, etcetera.
