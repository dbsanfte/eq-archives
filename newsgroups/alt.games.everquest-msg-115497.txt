Well, in all fairness, the invis potions that you can buy from vendors
are a pretty good deal, and I always carry a few on my warrior. Pretty
cheap, and while the duration is *wildly* fucking unpredictable (I've
had some start wearing off before I could close the inventory window)
they can come in handy in certain places. But it's probably the only
useful potion on the vendors that's not insanely priced.
