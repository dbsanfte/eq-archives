Yeah, they're great!  I read about it in the patch message and took my dark elf
shadowknight right into Oggok to go find him. I had been fighting lizard men in
The Feerot and was kinda nervous about getting killed. It's a long hike from
Neriak. Just find them and tell them to "bind my soul".. good to go.  :-)
