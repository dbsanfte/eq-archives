Today I was in Marus Seru fighting almost anything that was in my way.
While sitting to med & let pet heal, I was ambushed by a Zelniak Shredder.
I stood up, send pet in, step back, cast Dooming Darkness, Vampiric Curse,
Fear, then as the mob began to run (normally at this point), I cast Boil
Blood on him.  Suddenly he began to stagger (NOT lag, this was movement of
the animation).  His front end walked normally, but he would lean left &
right & left & right repeatedly while his hind end was swerving all over
around him, at some points even making him walk backwards.  Even when he
unfeared, he was still hardly able to hold himself up to fight my pet.

Anyone else seen this?
