We're going to go round and round on the spell-book issue.  I realize
you've played a caster or two.  I'm not sure how much you've grouped
with them though.  My Shaman (25), my first mage (20 on povar) and
my current mage (51)all grouped extensively.  What the spell book fostered
was not roleplaying in anyway.  Instead, it cut me off from the
the combat, since I *HAD* to be medding during fights.  Soloing, the
spellbook is truly a non-issue, since you can park somewhere safe,
med and walk away.  In a group, with non-stop pulls, you are almost
always medding, except for 5 seconds at a stretch when you stand to
cast.  Not having the spellbook isn't about easy, you don't regain
mana any faster when you don't have to stare at it.  But at least you
can see the combat going on, rather than trying to deduce what is going
on from the combat spam.  I simply can't see how getting rid of it
is dumbing down the game.  I can give a concrete example of how getting
rid of it helps young players learn their class - For mage's, it's 
essential to be able to see the puller arrive, ensure your pet is on
the right target, and if it's not, work with the 'chanter to get it off.
It's very hard to learn these things pre - 35 as it stands because
you can't see.  If this is truly a debate, I'd love to see a good,
concrete example of how getting rid of it will be a detriment to the 
developement of good skills for young players.  

Second issue, xp bonuses for young players (<30) in dungeons.  We all know 
the syndrome, people who have gone Oasis/LoIO/DL to 50, and have no idea 
how to function in a dungeon.  The XP bonus will (hopefully) help lure them 
into those dungeons.  The extension of the rez line also helps with this, 
as it means the ability to be called back to the hunting party exists at a 
low level, and there is less reason not to hunt far from towns where you
can bind.  The amount of xp returned on the pre 30 rezzes is so small,
and the cost of death other than the run back to the dungeon also so small
pre 30, that the xp component of these rezzes is (IMO) simply a placebo.
Case in point:  Long ago Paw was a low teens dungeon.  I
hunted the outside at 8-10.  I grouped against the big boys at 14-16.
The problem was that Paw was underutilized.  The reason?  The distance
you had to run on a CR.  Now, if there had been a no xp revive at 14
back then, more people (particularly melees/hybrids - I did this with
my Bard) would have been willing to group there, knowing that a death
would have the cleric (preferably bound outside) calling them back.  
You're a 55 melee, tell me you'd hunt in some of the more out of the
way dungeons (Seb) if you couldn't bind nearby/get a port there/ or
get rezzed back after death.  Remember, none of the extra melee bind
points existed back then.  Yes, it's possible that the xp bonuses will 
cause faster leveling, but dungeons provide a more intense education (I 
remember my first time in Befallen.  I was a level 8 bard, about 3 weeks 
after release.  Man was I in for a surprise :)  As far as the < level 10 no 
CR thing - I think that is just a little questionable.  If you want to 
ease newbies into the penalties of death (which they already do, free food 
and a weapon up to level 3, no xp loss up to 6) maybe 10th is a bit high 
for no CR, but I don't see it having a huge effect on time to 50.  The 
Levels to 10 are just too easy nowadays already.

They responded to player pressure to remove it.  Brad was still there
and was loath to give up anything that was part of his original vision.
The roleplaying reasons fall far more into roleplaying rationalizations.
I.E.  This is the way it's going to be, so let's come up with a decent
rationalization for it.

Really, "That's the way it's been, and people are used to it" is a bad
reason to keep something that destroys the immersiveness of the game
experience for a substantial number of players.  That was my experience
with all my casters - that it destroyed the immersiveness.  This is
subjective, but it comes from lots of days played on casters.
