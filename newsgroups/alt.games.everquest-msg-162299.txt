I went in yesterday, with half my group, and three mobs up.  Needless to say, I
had to wait in the graveyard.

A few hours later, a group that I was in got its asteroids handed to it early
on, I resed the warrior twice so we got out in good order, but with two mobs
left standing.  I announced that we failed the test but there would be a wait
before the room was ready.  About ten seconds later, there was a great deal of
cursing as the group after us had some of their members booted.  I had a
conversation in tells with their leader, and determined that the exact same
thing had happened.

I suspect this has to do with mezing, I originally was convinced it was due to
charm but our group was not using charm.  At any rate, I can assure you that
none of my group were in there (I was, deliberately, last man out, and we had no
pets up) but there were mobs in there when we left, and there was a great
gnashing of teeth I found quite believable.

I can also assure you that when I zoned in that earlier time, there were mobs
there instantly kicking my butt and that of my chanter and rogue friends.  There
were two dead bodies in there as well, at that time, and we did think it
possible that one of them had been rezed or was FD or something along those
lines.  However, the time we left mobs standing and the other group got in
trouble, there were no bodies in there at all.

Perhaps the final mob is different for these purposes.  I know that I zoned in a
couple days ago, saw a chanter pet wandering around but gave it little thought,
went thru two waves, then on the third wave a mob used GFlux and suddenly I got
the dreaded 6 man message and popped to Tribunal, my group mates said that the
enchanter pet was "helping" them out.

I also imagine that its possible for the pet itself to get kicked out, so that
sometimes this would be ok.  Or that if a member of your party is dead (and so
not in the room) that the pet add won't be a problem.

Really?  Very strong rumor repeated from several different sources.  Having seen
the final mob only three times, and had a slow stick to him only once, I can't
say.
