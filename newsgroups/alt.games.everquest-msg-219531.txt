Technically speaking, the recession has been over for some time, it has 
to do with out Economists define it, and has very little to do with 
whether or not things are actually better for people in reality.  The 
recession ended at the end of 2001, when the GDP climbed again.  A 
recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of a decline in the GDP.  
Now, in the real world, where we all have to live, that has meant squat 
of course.
