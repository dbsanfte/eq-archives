The fact that it was a democrat that made the final call before it headed to
the courts seems to have eluded many people

The largest margin win since most of us have been alive.

A fact driven home when you look at the margin per-state.  Kerry won a few
states decisively (i.e., with a 5-10% spread) and many with a narrow margin. 
Bush won many states decisively and a few with a narrow margin.

Good choice or not?  Hell if I know.  I definitely wouldn't trouble myself
to vote for either of them.  At least Bush has some redeeming qualities,
such as a personality, and entertainment value.  Then again, maybe Kerry
could have bored the U.S.'s enemies into submission.  =)
