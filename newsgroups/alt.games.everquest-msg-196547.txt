No computer-run "random number generator" is truly random.  They're based on
a seed, and will produce output that will eventually repeat itself in a
pattern.

However, that pattern can be made sufficiently large enough that no one will
ever be able to detect the pattern.  For example, if the RNG will produce
1,000,000 results before they begin to repeat, who can possibly detect that
pattern?  Especially since the randomness is spread across so many different
results - resists, hits, chance that a named mob will spawn, /ran 100.

So while it is true that /random is not truly random, it is close enough to
random to make no difference.  So the law of averages does, indeed, apply.
Not in a purely mathematical way, but in a practical sense.
