At 53 you might be able to solo the nightmare fiends in PON using fear
snare and dots, or possibly charm if you're insane enough. Not sure I'd
want to rely on chloroblast as your main heal though.

Given the spells available to you you'd certainly want to go buy a KEI
and maybe spiritual purity or POTG as well to keep things turning over,
but honestly, the first tier POP planes arent that hard and there
are spots that are animal heavy... the trick is avoiding non-animal
adds.
