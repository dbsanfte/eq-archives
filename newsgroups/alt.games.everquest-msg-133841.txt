I just don't get him. He wanted his druid to be a cleric, so he
stopped playing the druid and made a cleric, which makes sense.
However, he persists in wanting his druid to be a cleric and thinking
that other druids should also want their druids to be clerics and want
CH, which he keeps wishing for, either directly or notquitedirectly,
like above. Makes you want to just smack him silly, doesn't it?
