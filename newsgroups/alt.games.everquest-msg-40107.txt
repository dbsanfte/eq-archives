If 100 people on a server want something, and that thing drops only
once an hour, it's going to take 100 hours to fill the demand
regardless of who is camping it. That it's taking a full team of six
low level characters instead of a single high level character doesn't
change the flow of that item into the economy.

The comment was in answer to your statement:

>Because camping an item sucks, Lokari, pure and simple.

You're absolutely right, as I said before - camping sucks. I agree
100%.

But if a lowbie is camping something that he also gets experience for,
it sucks less for him than it does for the high level who doesn't get
experience.

It has nothing *at all* to do with who is in the wrong or not.

I won't presume to speak for everyone, but when *I* decide to camp for
an item, I'd much prefer it if I get experience for the efforts in
addition to the item.

>I feel that a TCC world would, in the end, have a lower supply of items.

I don't agree, but even if you're right I don't see how this is a bad
thing. We all laugh about the alleged economy in EQ - one of it's
biggest problems is that there is effectively a never-ending supply of
items, so the value of them drop dramatically over time. Seems to me
that some level of scarcity would actually be a good thing.

As I noted above, any given camp produces the same quantities of items
over time, regardless of who is camping it. If a high level farmer
gets three drops of ItemX in an hour, that's three ItemX's available
for sale to lower levels. If the lower levels themselves occupy the
camp, they still get three per hour. If an item is desirable, it will
be camped by *someone*.

Vote with your money. Verant is a business, after all, and that is the
one thing they are sure to listen to.


>>*Anyone* can find and report a zone bug.

>Not everyone can survive it.

Survival isn't relevant to the issue of bugs becoming known and
corrected. In the example of the Goos that you gave, it only affected
the initial groups who discovered it - then it was corrected and no
longer affect anyone. 

It doesn't matter what level the people who discovered the bug are -
it was a single, short-lived, specific instance. If we want to bring
up example after example of cases to demonstrate our points, we can
burn this thread into oblivion, but it's a waste of time. We're not
debating specific cases of bugs, we're debating general play.

Of course, knowing that TCC is in place should mean that the high
level role-player isn't even bothering with the situation in question,
and so his immersion experience, and hence role-playing, isn't
affected - he's not even there.

Again, since TCC is in place, why is the higher level player bothering
with the zone at all? Is he going to spend enough time there chasing
the very few high level mobs that he's going to need regular access to
a Kejekan merchant?

Hunting in places without a convenient merchant is hardly a new
experience for the vast majority of high level players, especially
those who play evil races.

Where does the idea that a quest can be completed in a short time
frame come from? That there are quests which span a large number of
levels is a good thing.
