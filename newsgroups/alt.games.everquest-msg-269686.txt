It's a bitter cold day today, here in Tennessee...

47 F
We are having a horrible run up to winter, which officially starts in a 
few weeks; It's already started here...
Yesterday was 60ish, 73 the day before.

To be fair maybe they were talking about -10 Celsius (most of the planet 
is metric... it could be) which should be right around 15 F... much 
closer to sane that is.
(I'm dissapointed it took me a min in my head to come up with that 
approximation... I could pop that stuff out instantly when I was in 
school. But then the engineering department liked to mix and match 
metric and english units in the questions they gave.. called it 'what 
you'll see in the real world')
