Oh noooo!  I can't believe I was so dumb!  I just wanted to get a little better
view of the hole in Paineel, so I crept a little closer and.... I had fallen to
my death.  This character was only a level 3 enchanter, but I can him with some
pretty good char items.  Is it even worth it to try to get my corpse back, or
should I just give up and start over.  Thanks for the info!
