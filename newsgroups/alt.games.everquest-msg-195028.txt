I had the same problem.  Took many attempts to get to server select screen.  
World server would not respond when attempting to go further, happened 
multiple times.  Tried Chat server, told me it was too congested.  I gave 
up.  I did check that I could ping, and tracert to EMarr, and there were no 
problems there, so it was not a connection issue with the EMarr server in 
particular.  Don't know the name/IP of the login server, or whatever server 
(if different) that you connect to when selecting an EQ server, so could 
not check those.
