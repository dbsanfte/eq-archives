Actually, I've mostly solo'd my cleric up to level 34. He's had a little bit
of help once in a while from a friend who offers higher-level buffs and
heals, and has grouped twice for short periods of time, but it's really not
that difficult to solo a cleric, at least into the mid-30's. But I do agree
that druids are far easier to solo (mine's lvl 47 and has also solo'd most
of his life), and can kill reds that a solo cleric would find difficult to
take on (although not impossible, especially if the red is an undead).

Just my 2cp, for what it's worth. :)
