I've done it several times for guildies.  Something like /petition 
<idiot_guildie_01> has fallen asleep and our raid is almost over.  He's at 
the first rock to the left of the CS zone in WW.  We've got a group still 
fighting here to keep the wanderers from killing him, but would really 
appreciate it if you would boot him.  Thanks. 
Generally the GM gets back to you fairly quickly, though my guildleader 
once spent 3 hours protecting a friend in a bind-loop before a GM 
responded
