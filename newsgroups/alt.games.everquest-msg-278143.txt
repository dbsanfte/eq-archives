I dont know,so much has changed,especially the corpse summoning
NPC radically took away all risks left,so why not more spell slots.

For my Cleric,mostly playing puller in Ldon,only 9 slots is a pain:
1.Complete Heal
2.Fast Heal
3.Group Heal
4.Heal over time
5.Yaulp
6.Pacify
7.Stun 1
8.Stun 2
9.Root

I hear there are Clerics out there,who have Divine Barrier memmed all
the time,cant hardly imagine this.
What about buffs or cure spells?Every time someone has a minor disease
I need to swap spells.
And a slot fur a nuke wouldnt be too bad either,15 of 43 AAs on SCF
nearly wasted.  =)
