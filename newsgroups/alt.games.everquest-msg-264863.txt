Just as an FYI, I noticed 2 days ago that you can teach yourself a 
language, at least while in a group.  If you spam in a language in a group, 
you will get skillups in the language you are spamming, as well as any 
languages that others are spamming.  I taught myself Dragon and Elder 
Dragon from 50 and 40 respectively to 100 each while being taught Elder 
Tier'dal, Gnoll, and some other language by someone else in the group
