Kids today have it so easy don't they?  LOL

When I was their age, we didn't have PoK books or Luclin Portals...  We had to
either find a Druid or Wizard willing to port our butts around or we had to run
from one end of Antonica to the other and then take the boats...  (And for the
record... that boat from BB to FP is indeed a LONG ride...  I had enough time
to get on the boat in game, then in r/l get up, drive to the store, do a bit of
shopping, come home and I STILL had not zoned into Freeport...  hehe  Ok, so
the store is less than a minutes drive from my house and all I had to get were
smokes and some snacks, but still...)

But while we're on the subject of 'When I was your age' EQ style, does anyone
have any others?

I know that 'When I was your age', we didn't have newbie armor.  We had to run
around in Mud Stained Tunics until we could buy leather...  LOL

'When I was your age', we didn't have KEI, we had to make due with Breeze and
Clarity and we were damned happy to get those...  (ok, so this is less
applicable since they fixed the 'bug' allowing lowbies to get KEI but still... 
LOL)
