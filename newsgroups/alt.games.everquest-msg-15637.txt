Ah I see, so since Enchanters dont mind casting that spell a few hundred
times to make this stuff for you (after all its only mana) they will be more
then happy to sell the vials to you at their cost.  Which is like 6pp for
the pearl and 1.5pp for the vial, plus Headys which are 2gp per kiola sap
times eight for the Headys (of course we never fail so we dont have to worry
about that) so thats like 1.6pp, and then theres the silk swatches which if
you buy and get real lucky you might find for 2pp each, although lately
those newbys have wised up and are asking 5pp plus for them.  So given all
of this your cost on the cheapest item a one silk piece is 11pp.  Of course
reality is those pesky enchanters expect to get paid for their time and
charge a min of 10pp per vial and usually 15pp.  Plus some of the reciepes
take 2 and 3 silks. And of course if you need the services of a brewer, well
that costs extra too. And then of course theres the chance of failure, after
all this stuff doesn't trivial until 158.  And you sell it for 30pp each.
Say I don't suppose you play on Brell, because I could really use a set?
