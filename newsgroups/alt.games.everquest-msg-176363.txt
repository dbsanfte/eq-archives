Umm.... if you know that its incorrect, then say it. Debates arent won
by saying "incorrect". Say WHY its incorrect. As I understand it (and
it makes total sense from a programming standpoint) Big Yager is
right, each mob has a hate list. What you do determines your hate
value. Taunt adds to the taunters hate value. As does certain SK
spells (among many other factors/actions), hence thats why the spell
descriptions state they add a particular hate value or percentage to
the current hate value. The exact nuances im not sure, but the thoery
is correct. But, as you say, incorrect. Please enlighten us as to the
correct thoery.
