    I remember back in college I had a bisexual friend.  She knew that I was
straight, but she seemed to think that I was just lying to myself, that I really
was bi also.  She wasn't hitting on me, she just made it clear that since she
enjoyed bisexuality so much, it seemed to her that all other people were to,
since it was so great.

    I watched and read my share of fantasy and sci-fi fiction when I was
younger.  But as I've gotten older, I find myself less and less interested in
the lives and drama of fictional characters.  Now days I prefer to watch and
read nonfiction (and the internet of course, which is an odd mixing of the
two).  

   I understand that many people think that B5 is a great show.  I know that
Lenny enjoyed it alot.  I'm glad that _you_ enjoyed it.  But I have absolutely
no interest in it myself.
