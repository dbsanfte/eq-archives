No, I specifically mentioned Befallen and Blackburrow as possible 
exceptions, both zones that level appropriate people could have a hard 
time with in a recovery.

Other than those few exceptions (and yes, there are others, Kaesora, COM 
upper levels, deep inside Chardok... I'm sure you can think of other 
spots where a body was once tough for you to recover) though, bodies 
tend to be more of a nuisance to return to, rather than a real disaster.

I liked death penalties, in that they made death feel like a big deal, 
even though eventually I figured out that they were relatively 
unimportant after all.  By then, I already had the deeply ingrained fear 
of death that still creates a rush when things get dicey, while my 
concious mind knows that its not actually a big deal, so I don't get 
upset when I fail to stay alive.

I think this is a very good definition; a balance between working really 
hard to stay alive, and yet not feeling crushed and defeated when you 
don't manage to pull it out of the fire.  EQ does this right sometimes, 
other times we get too complacent about death.  I hate, for example, the 
Death Touch mechanism used by some raid level mobs; someone is GOING to 
die every 30 seconds, nothing at all can be done about it, well, that 
teaches you to just eat deaths as if they were nothing.

Some people are, and thats a pity, but it isn't inherant in the game 
mechanics, IMO, I've had a great time concentrating on getting by with 
whatever group or partnership or even soloing presented itself.

For other people, its about grinding out levels as smoothly and risk 
free as they can manage, and I guess thats ok for them.

I think thats a philosophical question, but I'll try to answer it 
anyway.  If the death exp penalties are meant to drive descisions about 
what to do, having your "main tank" be a pet, who won't suffer any 
penalty on death, doesn't make much sense.
