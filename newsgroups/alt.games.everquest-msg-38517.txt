I would have to disagree with this statement.  A player at 15 with his first
character could definately still be considered a newbie.

Why, you ask?

Because at 15 Wizards and Enchanters can still take a bit of punishment
from a blue mob.  If that same player that is tanking a single blue Dervish
at 15 thinks he's going to be tanking a single blue froggie in Sebilis at
51,
then he's still a newbie.  By 20 or so, he'll have figured it out after that
single green goblin hands him his ass in Permafrost.

On the other hand, "newbie" isn't a hard-and-fast-statement of fact.
On my first ToFS raid, I was a definate newbie.  Now I usually do the
pulling, as a rogue, no less.  A brand new player that is minorly twinked
with some patchwork and a decent weapon can still be a newbie,
but one twinked with some hints about where to hunt and what to do
with spells or such at certain levels ("Dude, get to Lavastorm at level
16 with your anti-summoned spell...") will lose that newbie status
much quicker.  I have a level 8 wizard that is completely untwinked,
'cept for two +35 mana rings that some level 48 wizard dropped on
her in Ak'Anon.  She is NOT a newbie...simply because I know for
her where to hunt and what to do in situations that a level 8 wizard can
get into (some include "root/nuke," "root/run," "run!" and "hit the /loc
key because you're not even going to have time to turn around." :-)  ).
If I end up taking her to higher levels, I'll become more of a newbie than
when I started with her, simply because I won't know certain things
that some spells do until I practice 'em out or get some spell descriptions
off of a spoiler site.
