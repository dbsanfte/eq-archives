Hi, Mike  :)

Try the Tunnel in East Commons - it is packed out with people selling
things  :)

Maybe a quest item?  Sorry, I don't know  :(

>My warrior is constantly poor - any ideas for earning pp?
Hunt for HQ Pelts, and sell them at auction on East Commons.  I
regularly sell HQ Cat pelts for 10 to 15pp each, and HQ Bear pelts can
sell for between 35 to 50pp each.  Even medium quality pelts can go
for 3 or 4pp each  :)

Trades such as Tailoring and Brewing will cost you more to progress in
than you'll make, so I wouldn't bother while you are low level.
