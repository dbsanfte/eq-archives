Agree on that one. A 30/36 2hs cost at least 6K on Veeshan, so doubt a Velium
War Lance will be that much cheaper, be sure to get at least 4K.
The problem can be that most WAR/PAL/SHD dont use piercing, since the 1hs and
2hs can damage for a lot more. So their piercing skill suck, and would take too
long to get up.
But keep trying, someday a guy with piercing skill maxed, or one that wanna
start a twink and want a great weapon to give him at levle 20 will come by, and
youll get rid of it.
