Actually, does America support Afghanistan? (Hint, America was the number
one humanitarian donor to Afghanistan in the world last year) Do we drop
thousands of tons of food there daily? Are we talking about breaking bones
of Palestinians, or are we spliiting time between bineg anti-terrorists and
humanitarians? What other country would selectively bomb military targets in
Afghanistan during the night, then give hungry people in the same place food
during the day? And, if these people are so innocent, and so bent on making
the world better, then why are they arresting journalists and burning down
UN buildings? Do they realize those people are there to help them
specifically?????

Afghanistan is lucky they didn't take on China, the Soviets, or some other
superpower who isn't quite so nice. If bin-jackass had done to Beijing what
he did to NYC, Afghanistan would not exist today.

Oh, and by the way, America _won't_ stop giving money to Egypt, Saudi,
Israel, or anyplace . And you know what, the attacks may continue for a bit,
but they'll stop. And we'll give our money to whomever we want. 300 million
dollars isn't enough to fight America for one week. Osama will fall. You'll
see... I can promise you that if the attacks continue, eventually there will
be nobody else left to attack. A well trained Marine or SEAL has the ability
to destroy at least 100 old afghanis carrying outdated weapons. We have
thousands of Marines. And they only get used when they no longer fear air
support, which makes them doubly tough. You saw what happened to the
'badass' red guard in Desert Storm!



Keep faith in a loser, though. Someone always needs to cheer for the
underdog!
