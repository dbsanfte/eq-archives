Experimenting with EQW.  Which may or may not be in violation of the EULA, 
depending on whether or not whichever GM/guide ends up being involved 
feels that it 'modifies game play', so shhh. :)

But here's the link: http://eqw.eqhackers.com/

Notes:  My machine has Win98 and 1GB of ram, an Athlon 1600XP on a 
Soyo Dragon MB, and a Gainward Gforce3 Ti550 (they mean Ti500, but just 
-had- to be different).  Translation: pretty good machine, but not 
incredibly good.  It ran two copies of EQW acceptably, but there was a 
fair amount of lag in whichever window didn't have focus, especially if 
that window was the second copy I started.  So I had to be fairly clever 
with deciding which character should /follow the other, and whether to 
load the PLer or the PLee in the first copy I started or the second.  
There were a few interesting parameters in the eqw.ini file that improved 
this somewhat, but it still bit serious ass in a lot of luclin zones.

Ultimately, it's very good for handing stuff from one character to 
another without having to trust anyone or hassle guildies to come hold 
stuff for you.  And it was good if I really wanted to read my email or 
surf the web while waiting for everyone else to show up for the raid... 
Except loading certain webpages like Alla's, castersrealm, everlore, 
etc. Would suck enough computer power that I'd get a massive lag spike. 
For PLing... getting a second computer was -sooo- much better. :)
