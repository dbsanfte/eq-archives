Have you seen Nektulos forest pre and post patch?  Take my word for it, you
do not know the zone because you have experience, it is completely
different.  I had my cleric out by the old newbie log, wandered a bit, and
suddenly found myself being nuked by 8 or so Halfling Scouts, then their
Captain ran up and killed me.  I have found that you can fight near the log
right next to the Neriak entrance, plenty of blues to level 4 there.  I
admit, that having experience playing the game does indeed help, but the
zone has changed completely from what I knew about it prepatch.  Neriak has
not changed, it's still a royal bitch to find your way around.
