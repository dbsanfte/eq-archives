I always have jolt up, but have memmed jolting blades maybe twice.  I
still find uses for jolt.  For one thing, sometimes you need to take
aggro, perhaps only for a moment.  Tanks can go AFK when you don't
expect it, chanters can grab aggro, adds, etc...Sometimes you have to
tank or at least get aggro off a "more important" character.  When
it's time to drop that aggro, jolt.  Also, as others have written, its
great for pulling without getting lots of hate.  And when chain
pulling, if you have aggro, you have to drop it before you run out to
pull again.  I like the fact that I have the option, at any time, to
drop aggro.
