Fine that you sorted it out.. but i found out i had somewhat a similar
problem, and i solved this by changing the "bitperpixel=16" to 32.. It seems
like it "refreshes" some texture cache or something.. I changed it back
after having started the game, and logged off again, and the problem was
gone..

Although.. i am happy for any tips on optimizing this game, koz i really
thinks the shar vahl city is waaaay to choppy (1200x1024 - P41.8GHz Rad8500)
