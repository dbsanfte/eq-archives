Technically speaking it is a weapon with a particle effect (animation) that
usually requires the frustration of getting a very rare drop from a very
rare spawn. For casters an epic's value generally lies in the fact it gives
them a unique spell/ability they have not got. For melee generally an epic
is just for looks, because by the time you have spent the effort to get it
there is generally something better. Ranger and Rogue epics may be an
exception.

Verant have said they are looking at expanding the epics (adding a new
tier - higher level if you like) which I think is good, but only if they
make it based on effort not on the chance of X mob spawning and dropping Y
super-rare-drop. That is what a lot of epics are currently like and it
really does cheapen them, frustrates the players, tears guilds apart and
causes bitterness. I'll probably still do mine if I can, but only because I
roleplay and I see it fitting for a Paladin to get that mighty Fiery
Defender, other than that I probably would just forget it.
