I'd prefer those stones not to be in PoK, but in a special "Guild
House Zone" which was reached from a PoK stone.  The same book could
be used by all guilds -- just the hall to which they were ported could
change. 

Would be rather cool if a guild could purchase a "guild hall" to which
they were ported and only members of that guild could enter that
guild-hall. Talk about a platinum sink. The size of the hall could
depend on the guild's longevity and number of members. The hall could
have a separate guild npc bazaar space, fountains and statuary once it
was large enough. Members of the guild could put tokens up for sale --
tokens recieved by casting buffs on the statues or on a bazaar bot
npc. Other members could recieve the buff by purchasing the tokens
from the npc bazaar bot and then tossing those tokens in a fountain or
clicking on them like potions. 

I'd prefer to sell stuff cheaper to guildies or even give it to them,
but I can't have two different prices in the bazaar based on the
buyer's guild tag.  Would be cool if I could put it for sale on an npc
in the guild hall cheap, while the same item was for sale at a much
higher price in the bazaar, in return for a token I could redeem later
for the cash or the item.  If the item and token poofed if no guildy
bought the item within a week, I could live with that.  The npc
merchant could even take a percentage of the price I set, so it could
be a platinum sink. It would make accepting a member into a guild much
more important, since you'd have to trust the applicants not to buy
cheap in the hall and then sell high in the bazaar.
