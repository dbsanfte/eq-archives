Of all those combos one wasn't mentioned... Bst/chanter
This is a EXCELLANT combo for all catagories, as long as the Bst
sticks to being pet cleric.
But only really gets effective with that duo until after their 30's
I have a 56 bst and have done that duo.. that wasn't much we couldn't
handle. Even with the bst's itty-bitty healing spell it worked ok if
chanter got agro and needed healing till he could stun or mez or charm
the mob again. If chanter got too much agro and couldn't stun, mez or
charm the mob again.. thats where that duo broke down, since Bst's
don't have taunt skill. Slowing taunts good but presumebly the chanter
has already done that and your slow won't stick.
