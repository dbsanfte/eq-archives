I'd also definitely have to recommend reinstalling XP from scratch. If you
were to make even a complete copy of your HDD with a program like Ghost and
then boot up the new computer with XP as is, chances are you'll just get a
blue screen of death when trying to boot. In fact I'd go so far as to say
odds on this is what will happen.

Windows NT-based OSes really don't like having the core hardware changed
considerably beneath them. It has a lot to do with the way they work. When
installed the OS has parts of it based on a set of drivers related to the
system. This is called a Hardware Abstaction Layer or HAL. If you switch the
computer that Windows XP is running on substantially ( like upgrading to a
new system with different hardware ) the HAL no longer works and can cause
all sorta of problems, often simply preventing the system from booting. It's
sort of like the OS doesn't have the right tools to talk to the system
anymore.

This is just my basic understanding of this sort of thing, but based on my
own experiences with Win2k and WinXP attempting to run them on new boxes, I
would skip it, put your drive in as a secondary HDD, install afresh on your
new drive and copy over whatever you want. Much easier that way.

Good luck!
