Well you clearly have the right of way to proceed and the other driver's
responsibility to safely merge with your lane, not your responsibility to
adjust to allow him. So, he'd get the traffic ticket for violating the law.
But if the trier of fact determined that you could have avoided the accident
but chose not to because of your insistence that you had the right of way,
you could very well share liability for the accident. There used to be a
notion of "Contributory Negligence" in California where you were denied a
claim if you had *any* share in the responsibility for an injury. That rule
was pretty harsh because if a jury determined that an accident was 99% my
fault, but 1% your fault, you lost your claim completely and recovered
nothing. They changed the law so that it's now a  "Comparative negligence"
state, meaning that in the above situation you'd be able to recover 99% and
would forfeit 1% due to your contribution. So in your hypothetical, a jury
might easily conclude that you're 50% at fault for the accident because of
your obstinance, and find you liable for half.
