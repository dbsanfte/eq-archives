You "all we care about is oil" folks keep dodging the question
that's been asked here multiple times:  If oil is our only
concern, why don't we just buddy up to Saddam and look the
other way no matter what he does, in exchange for his keeping
the oil flowing to us?

That'd be a hell of a lot easier and more of a sure thing
than ten years of sanctions and another war with an uncertain
outcome (as to who might end up in charge and how friendly
they might be to us, not to mention the chance of making
*other* oil producing countries pissed enough to shut
off their taps to us).

Sorry, this whole Grand Conspiracy For Oil theory is just
laughable.  It's like one of those bad movies where the
villains do some wildly elaborate, risky scheme to pull
off their crime when there's some far more direct way to
accomplish it (e.g., "Don't Say A Word" -- the bad guys
kidnap Michael Douglas's daughter to force him to use
his psychiatry skill to get a catatonic girl in a mental
ward to have a breakthrough and reveal the serial number
of her father's coffin so they can dig it up and retrieve
the heist booty buried with him.  Gosh, wouldn't it have
been simpler to just burgle the office of the cemetery and
look up the location of the coffins interred on the day
he was buried, WHICH THEY ALREADY KNEW?)

Come back when you have a plausible theory that actually
makes sense.

Fine.   You believe the voices in your head.

I'd rather believe something that doesn't have gaping
holes in it, that isn't based on a need for vast conspiracies
and robber-barons using the world as their pawns, etc.
etc.  Enjoy your paranoia, you cling to it so tightly that
it must give you some sort of strange comfort.
