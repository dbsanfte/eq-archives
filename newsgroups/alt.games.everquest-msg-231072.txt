No the term existed before Tolkein used it. THe OED has it going back to
the late 1700s for a person who was not full grown or a stripling. Given
at the time you cold well be a 'working man' and in that cetegory,
essentially Tolkein took the concept and used it as the perception of the
big races of Hobbits and mapped the term into his background. I can't find
a mythological reference for it to any fey type but then the biggest myth
bestiary I used to use has disappeared from its site...as an adverb of the
same concept it goes back even further but thats stretching the connection
on that I feel.

Hobbit in the OED is directly linked to Tolkein - interestingly hobbits
aso refers to a small but powerful howitzer/cannon type - given his
entymological routes it would be amusing if he saw this and chose the word
because of this....small an ineffectual looking but actually quite
dangerous?
