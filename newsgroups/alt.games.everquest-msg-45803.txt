I'm looking for advice on how to advance my level 25 iksar
necromancer.  She can sometimes get into groups, but people aren't
clamoring to invite her.  Sometimes people she's grouped with in the
past will invite her.  Mostly, she's just ignored in LOIO.  I hear
necros are good at soloing, but the LOIO just seems too dangerous for
that.  Wandering mobs tend to join the fight.  Does anyone have advice
where to relatively safely fight on Kunark at her level, soloing? She
wouldn't be against leaving the continent other than that she needs a
place to bank and sell.  She is my highest level character, so am not
sure where to take her.  Her gear is also terrible (mostly raw silk),
so any help in that regard would also be greatly appreciated =)


Thank you for any advice,
Jennie
