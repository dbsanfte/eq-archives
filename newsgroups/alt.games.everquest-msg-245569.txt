One thing helping AotC, and the next one, is stubborness.  I will see the
final one in the theater, even though I doubt it will be theater-worthy,
just because I'm determined to finish the series.

I have DirecTV with all the movie channels, and a 61" DLP TV, at home, so
normally there has to be a very strong reason to see a movie in a theater
for me.  I figure that I'm paying a fixed monthy price for the movie
channels, and so the more movies I watch on them, the less it costs per
movie, and so want to save as much as possible for them.

For DVD, I think I'll finally have to get around to buying one of those
video capture dohickeys, and use that to convert my Episode IV, V, and VI
Laserdiscs to DVD.  That way, I can have DVDs that are the good editions,
rather than the "special" editions.  Unfortunately, the laserdiscs are
pan-and-scan rather than letterboxed, but talking with my friends, we've
decided that pan-and-scan original is better than letterboxed revised.
