This is what guilds were for.  You figure out out-of-game, on your guild
boards and/or calendar when people will be on, so you get on, and quickly
get a guild group.

As far as everything being camped, this is what Rangers are for.  At most
levels, there was *always* plenty of good uncamped stuff available, but most
people completely ignored it.  Even small zones usually had at least 200
mobs in them up at any give time.  (I used to get my Wizard, fire up ShowEQ
on my Linux box, and just port around the world, and run to various zones,
just marveling at just how many mobs there were, at all level ranges, that
were left completely unmolested by the players).

With a Ranger and a Druid or Wizard for porting, a group, at most levels,
should have been able to find good, uncontested, places to hunt easily.
