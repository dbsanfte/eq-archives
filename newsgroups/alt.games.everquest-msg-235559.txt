Doesn't matter? Why wouldn't it matter to people that they can sell
DonationA to someone in bazaar 5K pp but only get 2K tribute points for the
item? If they want to get tribute points for the item they're better off
getting the "market value" of the item in bazaar and then contributing the
5K pp from that exchange to the Tribute Master.

The reason they yanked the Tribute Masters is because the tribute points
being given were far above the market value of the items being donated.
Market value is very tied into this issue.No one was out to buy high and
donate low, well ... maybe some that didn't think of the market value of the
items they donated.
