Not perfect, but better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.
Is that a complete workaround?  (i.e. a raid of L65s can get a L1
drop?)  If so they oughta just abandon TLC, it doesn't work well.
It's the one character per account rule that makes FV different,
the language thing was cool for about 3 days, and then it was
nothing but a big pita (later converted to a minor pita when they
dropped the ridiculous slow-down in language learning, and now a
petty pita with the availability of language independant chat
channels).  Shoot, drop the other crap and I bet they'd have
enough interest to open another one-character per account server
(they could call it the <d00ds discouraged> server, to distinguish
it from <roleplaying preferred>, whatever the hell that's supposed
to mean).
