One thing I've never understood about those people who freak out over
someone "taking a game too seriously" is are they actually afraid of the
game because THEY take it too seriously?  Do they themselves know so little
about reality that they think a person playing a game involving spells and
killing will try to cast spells on them, and because they believe this, also
believe that the fictitious spells will actually work in a real world?
    I've always considered those kind of people to be the real ones who
can't distinguish fantasy from reality (otherwise if they could, they'd know
the person really wouldn't be a threat simply by playing the game).
    Sure you can argue that playing with violence teaches violence and other
situations like that (playing with magic in fantasy teaches it in reality),
but how often does that happen?  Enough to worry about?  More accurately it
may be that a person who plays nothing but violent games may have that seen
as a clue that they may have had violent tendencies to begin with, and due
to the already developed interests/thoughts, the game was appealing to them,
therefore getting them to play it.  RPGs the same way.  EverQuest was the
first big RPG I've played, and have sense then learned more about this
world, but the only reason I liked EQ is because I was already interested in
RPG type of games anyway.  The consol games (NES, GameBoy, SNES, N64) was
until then the closest I'd come to the RPG world (actually started Baldur's
Gate just a month before seeing EQ, and the fact that I liked it was the
reason the co-worker showed me EQ).
