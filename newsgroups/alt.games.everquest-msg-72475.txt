yeah boat routes are weird mainly due to them not really existing...zones
dont all back together like u think, they're really like all over the place.
If u can get to BB do it, else u will end up in overThere a darkie outpost.
If ur not Darkie then u are KOS in Overthere...and its hard to bind, not
nice place for a nice druid hehe
