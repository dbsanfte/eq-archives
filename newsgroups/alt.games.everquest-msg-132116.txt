    This is the reason I use when the "we want points" people start their
monthly bitching on the message boards. Our primary strategist is on Asian
time, and has fairly low raid participation compared to others. Should he
get shut out of loot because of it? Is loot meant to improve the guild so
bigger challenges can be taken down, or is it a reward for helping the guild
achieve its goals? That last question really make 'em sputter. ;-)

    And those variables make or break the system. On my server the other big
guild's points system was horribly biased in favour of the long-time,
every-day raiders, so much so that my guild could predict with 90% accuracy
who would get "big ticket" items when they dropped. Newer members in that
guild always got table scraps, and it demoralized them. You also get
"costing stupidity" stemming from having to put a cost on every drop to
prevent points inflation. Again, that other guild demanded that new clerics
joining obtain their epic - and put a points cost on every piece of the epic
that (of course) was greater than the points allocated for the raid. So new
clerics, regardless of if they had a post-epic weapon or not, were placed in
a points deficit shortly after they joined for something they may or may not
have wanted, but which the guild did.

    Something not discussed when talking about points systems is the
scheming it starts. Example: if my guild moved to a points system, I would
get together with two other PST clerics and block the recruitment of ANY
clerics outside our time zone. This would render the guild unable to raid
until we got on, ensuring nobody could pass us in points. Right now I can
kiss ass, I can work my butt off, I can do a lot of things to try and get
loot - but I have no idea if any of them will work. So, eventually, I'll get
tired of doing the dysfunctional things and stop. At least that's the
theory. ;-)

    We have people that complain all the time about loot, or have their
monthly eruption about the unfairness of it all. Frankly, we could lose 90%
of those people and we'd have a stronger guild. I can think of only one
person I've seen ask for points who is honestly doing it to increase raid
participation and whose loss would be a blow to the guild. The rest are
drama queens who think everyone hates them. And the more they whine and act
up, the truer it gets. When one person acts up so much that some of the main
tanks have made /ignore person's_name hotkeys there's something wrong with
the person, not the system.

    So far officer award has worked better for us, and is the system I
support (even though I'd be close to the top of any points system). It keeps
our part-timers interested and engaged, it allows for recognition of things
that points can't recognize like planning and skill, and it avoids the sort
of dysfunctional scheming that can happen when people know how to get loot
without advancing guild goals.
