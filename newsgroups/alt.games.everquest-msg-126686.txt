Jim,

I believe your fizzles are primarily based upon your skill level in the
circle of magic inwhich the spell is based (Divination, Alteration,
Conjuration, Abjuration or Evocation).  The reason new spells are fizzling
more is because they require more skill than you currently have to be cast
fizzle-free. This is why your lower levels spells should fizzle less.

The formula for max skill for any given level is ([level x 5] +5). Thus a
level 20 would have skill caps set at 105 til he dings level 21. Most skills
max out at 200 and stay there until you ding 51 when alot of skill caps are
raised again.

My suggestion to you would be to find out which spell is fizzling, check the
spell description to see what skill it requires and then find another
low-level, low-mana cost spell you can cast over and over to practice that
particular skill up.  Some spells might seem somewhat useless to you until
you look at them as excellent ways to raise spell casting skills through
efficient practicing :)

Hope this helps out,
