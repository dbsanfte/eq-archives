Yes, but YOU'RE missing the pertinent fact that regular EQ sessions are not
possible for some people, myself among them.

My group currently meets once a month for Shadowrun.  We show an average of
80-90% attendance.  The people I know in EQ show 90% attendance at the very
best.  Usually it's more like 30%.  Also, as soon as group attendance gets
high, it means the server is crowded, and the random connection drops begin.
Any time the player count on Nameless is above 2200 or so, I am randomly cut
off about once every 45 minutes.  Why do you talk of playing "reliably"?
Show me a dice-and-paper game from which you can be lagged out.  Show me a
dice-and-paper game where you have to wait over an hour just to get a GM's
attention.  Show me a dice-and-paper game where monsters walk through walls
and teleport, not because of powers they have, but because of glitches.
