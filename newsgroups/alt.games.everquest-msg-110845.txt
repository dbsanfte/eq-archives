Hello all. I am a level 17 Wizard on Tunare server and would just like to
hear any suggestions on where to hunt to get thru these levels quickly. Most
strategy guides I have found on Internet are pre-Luclin as nobody seems to
suggest any Luclin zones. Who knows, maybe there are no good Luclin zones
for these levels.

Even though I am a Wizard, I would like to hear any strategies for these
levels as I have other characters also. thanks.

Bropine
