I had some strange things happen to me with regards to EB, and Kedge Keep. I
was bound out there with my druid to keep an eye out for the Tainted Sea
Horse. Vi has a Lodizal Shell Shield for he EB item. Since I play on a Zek
server, there were a few times that I had unannticipated deaths and showed
up at my bind point sans gear. Those times it did happen, I was MOST
surprised to see that while my Air Remaining bar came up, it never went
down. Im not sure why this happened, but it was convenient.
