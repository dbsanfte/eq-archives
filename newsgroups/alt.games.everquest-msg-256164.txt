Absolutely, positively, 100% false.  This from someone who plays a monk,
2-boxes the cleric, and will at times have a comparably equipped ranger tank
instead.

As has been mentioned before in this thread.  Taunting is a large part of
tanking.  But beyond that, the ranger simply tanks as good as I do, with a
more predictable need for heals.  And on top of that, I can only get better
by raising my hitpoints, as I'm long passed the point where AC increases
stop making a difference (an aspect exclusive to the monk class), whereas
the ranger can, and will, continue to increase his armor class in addition
to his hitpoints.

All this said while freely admitting that *I* tank better than the "average"
level 65 warrior.
