Bush has shown himself to be every bit the idiot, and more. He is a
fancy monkey with some shrewd handlers, not to mention a lot of money
behind him. But Bush himself is a no-nothing.
When was the last time you saw Bush responding to policy questions?
He is kept hidden, brought out for a stage show. He has no clue what
is going on, he is just the show.
