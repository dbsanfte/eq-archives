This is a great list!  But unfortunately, it is old and out of date.

This has changed due to introduction of flayed skin.  Not that they are
all that common, but a lot more than they used to be.

I haven't looked for these, but I imagine there are a couple more than
there used to be.

> 8. Barbarian Rogue 0.4%

This is a VERY old list indeed.  Barbarian rogues are certainly more
than twice as common as, say, gnome rogues.

Halflings have closed the gap with wood elves and might have even
passed them.  Word gets around.

> 3. Human Monk 4.9%

I would bet that iksar monks now outnumber humans.

> 7. Human Paladin 3.0%

This has gotten a lot less common.

> 8. High Elf Enchanter 2.9%

Hmmm, you see a lot more dwarf and even halfling clerics than you used
to.  IMHO dwarf is clearly superior to high elf.  Don't know if this
would have changed, but it might have.

> 10. Wood Elf Ranger 2.7%

Same as human paladin.  This used to be a VERY popular race/class, but
word gets around.  It is still a great race/class for first 40 levels
or so, but grouping problems after level 50 have discouraged it.
