Hi all,

  I've got some friends gathering tonight to go into MM, and none of us have
ever been there.  Well, I've been in a short distance at level 35 (bard)
with 35 warrior friend and everything aggroed, even the greens, so we
bolted.  Now we have a full group or so going in.  Basically, they're
helping me get MM drums and Lute of the gypsy princess.
I've heard the trains here are nasty.  Judging by the map I downloaded it
appears we don't have to go too far for lute/drums mob spawn.  Please give
any advice we could use as we are all pretty "green" to this zone.
The group going should consist of:
39 Bard, 43 Cleric, 39 warrior, 40 mage, 41 warrior, 37 druid.  Also a 52
shaman that used to be in my old guild might stop by to buff the crap out of
us and help heals.  We might have a couple more coming too.

Thanks in advance for any advice,
Sean...
