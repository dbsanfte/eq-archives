Losing what? It's true. Believe whatever you *want*. But if you decide
to claim what you think I mean publicly, be prepared for me to offer a
contrasting view.

You intimated that I was unable to just drop the threads that you

It addresses your very last statement.

No, I said other posters can take care of themselves. Or they can't.
Either way, they don't need you to be their nanny.

Up to you. It's you, or at least your attitude in this thread. You can
find me on that page too as a rebuttal if you like.

I explained it to you. Your idea of "a better person" means nothing to
me.

Somehow I'm not worried.

My own words repeated back at me, as well.

Obviously not as clearly as you think, since you are assigning me
motives and emotions that simply aren't true.

Or are you planning to again tell me what I'm thinking?

When did I ever say that? I do all those things (except whine). What
you continue to miss is I simply don't *care* about the consequences.

Want me to put it another way? You're not my friend. I don't care
about you. Or anyone else here. I treat people the same way they treat
me, as much as I can (I don't claim 100% success, sometimes I slip
up). There's some I genuinely like, even some that have me killfiled,
but I attach so little emotional importance to winning over nameless
people on a game newsgroup I will never interact with again outside of
here, its not enough to really raise my interest in maintaining a
standing in their, or your, eyes. And they obviously feel the same
way, or they wouldn't open fire first so often.

I think any thread called "Count Ben's Wrongs" would be taken
completely out of the context you put it in. Any thread that's
deliberately posted to bring flames on someone counts as about the
lamest things someone can do on usenet beyond using sockpuppets.

Um, how so? I think I know what my concerns are better than you do,
and believe me, worrying about whether or not I'll get flamed on
a.g.e. is not one of them.

I was too antagonistic with you, but as I recall you attempted to
prove something I said wrong by using math that was fatally flawed.
Even then I was just contemptuous of your math, not you directly, not
at first at least.


> You don't
>attack anyone, you just defend yourself?

No, but in general I don't strike first.

Did I here?

Come or don't come. Just don't *whine* about getting flamed when you
started it. I can't abide whiners.

Welcome to usenet.
