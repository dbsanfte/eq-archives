Actually, I don't think they want to "play Firiona Vie together" (they can't
play any server together) they just want both of them to be able to play on
that server. It's like buying a bus pass under one name and then both of
them using it to get around town. Sounds like cheapskates to me. Anyway,
unfortunately all of us have to put up with some things in the game that we
don't like and I'm afraid that this is their thing. If it is such a hardship
for them, an extra few dollars a month can resolve the problem (which is
more than can be said for most of the problems that others have to
tolerate).
