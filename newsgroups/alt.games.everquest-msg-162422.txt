Did PoN for the first time last night - thanks to any of those in my group
if you see this. ;)

Originally, it started as a me LFG'ing just for grins, but then just asking
to sit and watch a group. They invited me after just a bit, and I followed
with a very quick thanks for them taking a mercy case. I was clearly not
pulling my weight for at least the first 15 minutes as I tried to settle in
to what worked and what didn't, my role in the group, etc.. In the end, I
managed to find a not bad mix that had me clearly the wink link in the
group, but also a link that was still contributing strength to the whole. I
was there about 90 minutes and got a gold. Not bad at all. Can do better
solo in JP, but not by all that much.

What a freak'n busy night though - carpal central. Haste, slow/snare, mana,
cantana, resists - everything but mezz/charm got put to use last night. It
was funny though, as the time wore on and group members LD'd on us (major LD
last night) or just plain had to leave (one poor gal had her husband wake up
and find her at the computer, and he apparently wasn't real happy), I wound
up in a completely different group. Was funny when they suddenly realized
that I was 48. hehe. Everyone was VERY, VERY cool about it though, and very
helpful. This is actually usually the case if I remember my place, and I
have always enjoyed that "Help the lowbie" spirit - especially when I get to
return it to some other lowbie....


Fun times. Doubt I'll be back until 50 or so since I have other things to do
anyway, but very fun times. Thanks for the replies on this thread BTW.
