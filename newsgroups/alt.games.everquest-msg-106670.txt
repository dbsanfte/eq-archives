I imagine it will catch you up eventually ;) I suspect its part of
the big references line my newsreader includes which I'll cut and
paste here for you:

Anyway , it was about hunting Wyverns and Cubes in skyshrine. I may
have misremembered the wyvern names, but they're basically big
white/yellow/red con (to 60) wyverns that came very very close to
chasing me down and keeling me on long pulls...

Lots of fun ;)

Of course, you could just move the party to the wyvern, but I'm not
sure that counts.

They're on the way to , uh, the seer? I've only hunted in SS once
after a ToV session I caved and got given 4 bits of chain from
including arms and legs, so I had to sulkily increase my Kromzek
faction briefly for the handins.
