My cleric really needs to be sitting.  My ranger is more than happy to loot if
asked but I don't offer.  It's not a fun job.  Why not just ask if you can be
ML?  Most groups are happy to have someone offer.
Don't be afraid to ask about loot rules up front either.  And if you don't like
them, find another group.  Don't wait until an item drops that you want and
*then* start whining about how you don't like the rules.
