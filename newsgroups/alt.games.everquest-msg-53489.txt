And I consider those who feel it is rude to be morons.  So I should
respect the fact that they chose to freak out?  How about making
number 3:

3) Get upset if someone inspects you without asking.  So someone knows
what you have, big deal.

I disagree.  Whether I chose to inspect you or you to inspect me says
absolutely NOTHING about ones Manners.  I have yet to hear a viable
reason (to me) by those who do get upset by it.

The only thing I dont like is those who will inspect and then ask if
they can buy something.  Especially since if they took the time to
read the Bio they would see the words "Nothing you see is for sale".
If someone asks to buy something I am wearing, I tell them to inspect
again and read the bio.  They do and usually apologize.

>When I inspect someone, *even* someone who's

Now THAT makes as much sense as going to a grocery store and asking if
you can take a look around and see what they are selling.
