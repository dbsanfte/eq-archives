Thanks for the tips.  I did mangage to get to Thurgadin unscathed, but
with a little trouble.  My camo dropped on the way over from NRO, and as
soon as I docked at the little island to switch boats, a shadow guardian
started whomping my butt.  Luckily it wasn't very quick and my SOW was
up, so I hightailed it to the other dock, invis'd and camped just as it
was coming over the hill for me.  (Do those things see through invis,
i.e. are they undead?)

The rest of the trip was uneventful, just traveling the shoreline.  All
those red nasties on track too <grin>.  I think I'll poke around a bit,
then come back when I'm in my 30's like a smart little druid!

Chip
