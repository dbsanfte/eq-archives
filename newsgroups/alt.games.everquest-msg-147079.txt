Well, you can run to EW, assuming a SOW or jboots/tboots.  What's the jboots
situation now on most servers?  Have tboots reduced the competition for the
AC in SRo?  If so, I'd recommend some serious jboots camping around the
mid-30's.

I love my jboots.  Was in EW the other day, cast Harvest, and it stopped
halfway through.  Thought "what the hell" and cast it again.  It stopped
again.  Then I noticed over in my main chat window some messages about a
Kromrif Death Squad beating the crap out of me.  Took off running with about
1.5 bubbles of health left.  I was in front of the ramp to Kael, and I ran
all the way to IC.  The week or two on my ass in SRo around 36 was well
worth it in time saved since then. :-)

Alas, they got their revenge a few days later.  Was one freaking blue from
54, and sat down to med, carefully hiding first, and making sure hide
worked.  No one told me the Death Squad sees through hide.  Went AFK, and
came back in 10 minutes, dead.  Eventually found a 54 Cleric who would
answer my /ooc offer to buy a rez for 250 plat, and so got most of the XP
back, and the Cleric dragged along a 60 Enchanter who threw in a free KEI
which was nice (actually, I think the Cleric and the Enchanter were both
being played by the same person, the Druid who brought them--which is one
nice money making 3-box setup...he can offer almost any service that people
are willing to pay for: ports, rez, and KEI).  Since then, I've taken to
going way down the ice cliffs and medding by the water if I'm going to go
AFK.  Anyone know if the Death Squad goes down there?  I wonder if I'd be
safer levitating and going out a ways over the water?  (Can't hide while
levitating, though, so if there is anything hostile in the water, it could
attack).
