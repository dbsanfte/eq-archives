Yeah hehe, it really hurts being level 1.  Most of us choose to leave that
ASAP.

Good call.  An evil warrior as your first char wouldn't have been *my*
advice.

Misty Thicket?  Best newbie area in the game. You're new and dying just the
way probably the rest of us here did in the beginning.  My personal bests,
logging in my brand new Dark Elf necro in Neriak during beta 4, running up
to a guard - jumping a couple times, trying to say hi and promptly having my
happy ass sent right out to my newbie spawn point in the Nektulos forest.
Such fond memories....Guard Har 'Dass was his name I think.

If this is all the patience you have, then yeah, don't let the door slap
that ass on the way out.
