Not quite the way it works, the high con bonus scales based on the 
difference in levels, it is not a fixed bonus.  You will see a gradual 
drop in xp as you level up.

In fire, where the mobs I solo were white, yellow, and red to me at level 
65, I still get a high con bonus at level 69, and will at level 70, but, 
it is not as high a bonus as I did killing them at level 65.  However, I 
do kill them faster now, I have less resists, and I have better spells at 
my disposal.
