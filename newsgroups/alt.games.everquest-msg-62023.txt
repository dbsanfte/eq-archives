AFAIK, the Thurg Potion (player made) and the CT Gate potion (dropped) are
the only two in the game.  Oh, there *is* the Shaman-made Gate potion, too,
I believe.

There is a quested Hammer that procs a gate to the Overthere Outpost.

If you're looking for general information about alternative Gates/Ports -
visit my pages at HTTP://HOW.TO/STAYHIDDEN.  I include some of that info
there.
