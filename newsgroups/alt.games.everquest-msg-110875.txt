Not so much experience though.  We sat around waiting for most of the time.
Really could have got more experience soloing kodiaks or frost giants in GD.
But I did learn something I guess.

Not certain about the mix, but probably McVaxius berserker (str/haste),
Kattas sworddancing (dex and dex debuff), invigor (stamina), and soothing
(heal and mana).  And before you ask yes I do use instruments (3).  I
usually like to sing dots when we have so few melee, but they probably
wouldnt have landed.  I don't normally have a problem with aggro except when
I do 4 dots and even then not so much if I stand back a bit.

Never heard of cannonballing.  What is it?
