I'm not an atheist, I'm sort of a Irish pagan who's been influenced by Sufi
writings.  I've studied early church history and have a cursory knowledge of
gnostic and non-canonical christian writings.  I happen to find the
Catholic-derived Christian faith deeply offensive on several levels (I don't
actually have a lot good to say about any leg of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic
faith tripod), however that's not an appropriate topic for this ng.


-Well, God was my co-pilot....but we crashed into a mountain and I had to eat
Him.
