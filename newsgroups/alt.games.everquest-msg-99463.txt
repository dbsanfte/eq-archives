The thing that made some near TPW's more bearable for my guild wasn't
getting 56+ clerics, it was that one of our clerics completed her
epic. Instead of all the clerics sitting around medding and modrodding
like crazy and spending ages getting all the casualties back, we
gather our fallen, she clicks everyone, and we spend 5 minutes rezzing
instead of half an hour.
Of course, we still have the same problems gathering our fallen...
