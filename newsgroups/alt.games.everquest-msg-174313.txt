It wouldn't matter if I did, you'd only claim it

"According to the Los Angeles Times (2/13/91),
U.S. intelligence reported that American- supplied
helicopters had been used in such chemical attacks
on Iraq's Kurds."

You don't like this source?

Yes.

My accusation, as you can't seem to remember what
it was, is; that when you say "If we were as
monomanically fixated on oil as you laughably
believe, we'd just look the other way when Saddam
gasses his civilians and pay him for oil with the
cash and arms he craves." then this is exactly
what happened. 

The US did look the other way when Saddam was
gassing the Kurds, that the US did get paid with
oil, for the arms he craved. That the US is
fixated on the oil reserves in the Middle East.

I don't think that even your naivete would stretch
so far as thinking that the US had no idea that
these helicopters would be used for anything other
than crop spraying. 

Do you think ANYONE ever believed Saddam was not
going to put those helicopters to military use.

Even you cannot be that dense.

The US knew the reason for the sale and so do you.

http://www.mediamonitors.net/mosaddeq14.html
"With Iraq off the terrorism list and export
controls on dual-use technologies (i.e. with both
civilian and military applications) therefore less
restrictive, 60 Hughes MD-500 �Defender�
helicopters, and then 10 Bell Helicopters - models
which were widely employed in the invasion of
Vietnam - were sold to Saddam�s regime. Other
helicopter sales followed, such as 48 that were
said to be for �recreation� purposes. These were
subsequently employed to bomb and gas Kurdish
civilians."

Still with the "We only sold him military
helicopters to spray his crops" routine?

So?

What are you saying, that the US is no worse than
the French or Soviets?

>And you're trying to smear the US because we sold them
>some *Bells*?

Not just Bells.

How many times do we have to go over this. 
You said;
"If we were as monomanically fixated on oil as you
laughably believe, we'd just look the other way
when Saddam gasses his civilians and pay him for
oil with the cash and arms he craves."

I am saying this is exactly what the US did.

You have never looked for it.

I apologise, I was in error. I knew it hadn't
passed, but I didn't know the exact mechanism by
which it hadn't passed.

This is Christophers Hitchens view of it;

http://www.humanrights.de/~kurdweb/halabja/en/articles/article-001.html
"Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., convinced by staff
reports to the Foreign Relations Committee that
tactics of extermination were being employed in
Iraqi Kurdistan, introduced the Prevention of
Genocide Act in the Senate, but decisive pressure
was employed by the Reagan administration to get
the measure killed."

I think when you say that "we'd just look the
other way when Saddam gasses his civilians", that
this history that you have provided, proves that
IS exactly what happened.

I agree with you that is HOW the bill failed, but
how about telling us WHY it failed.

So what concrete measures did the administration
take, after such a huge public outcry?

Did they stop providing aid to Iraq?

Did they denounce Iraq?

Did they apply economic sanctions to Iraq.

What did they do to help the Kurds?

Your naivete is almost unbelievable;

http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/8/18/81805.shtml
WASHINGTON -- A covert American program provided
Iraq with critical assistance in its war with Iran
at a time when American intelligence agencies knew
that Iraqi commanders would employ chemical
weapons, the New York Times reported Sunday. 
American intelligence officers never encouraged or
condoned Iraq's use of chemical weapons, but
neither did they oppose it because they considered
Iraq to be struggling for its survival, people
involved at the time said in interviews with the
newspaper. 

Some U.S. military officers agreed to speak on the
condition that they not be identified about the
nature of gas warfare on both sides of the
Iraq-Iran conflict from 1981 to 1988. 

The Pentagon "wasn't so horrified by Iraq's use of
gas," said one veteran of the program. "It was
just another way of killing people � whether with
a bullet or phosgene, it didn't make any
difference," he said."

Thats not what I said.

Do we really have to go over it yet again?

I've stated it 3 times already.

>
>It was a loan guarantee for *food*, you jackass.

What does it matter what the loan was for?

If you loan Iraq a billion dollars, then it frees
up Iraqi money that they would otherwise have to
spend on food, doesn't it?

A billion dollars that can be spent elsewhere.

Hardly. Not while they were still fighting Iran. 

Where was the billion dollar loan to the Kurds?

Any assistance to the Iraqi regime; food, medicine
or weapons, is helpful to their war effort. Why
would try to pretend otherwise.

Why no billion dollar food loan to Iran?

You don't like discussion, you like government
dogma. You are like a tuner with only one
frequency.

There was no outrage. Just a huge dose of
crocodile tears. 

Don't judge Reagan, Bush et al by what they SAID
about the Kurds, judge them by what they DID for
the Kurds... and that was fuck all.

http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/8/18/81805.shtml
"...For the first time, it seemed the United
States was poised to take action on their behalf.
Indeed, at one refugee camp, Van Hollen and I were
feted with an enthusiastic pro-American
demonstration. 

The Kurds were to be disappointed. The Reagan
administration, which had been providing Iraq with
$700 million a year in credit guarantees, saw
Hussein's Iraq both as a potential security
partner in the volatile Persian Gulf and as a
promising market for American products and
investment. 

Secretary of State George Shultz denounced Iraq's
use of chemical weapons, but others in the
administration seemed more concerned about the
Iraqi reaction should the sanctions become law.
(Senate passage of the Pell legislation produced
the biggest anti-American demonstration in Baghdad
in 20 years.) Working with the Republican House
leadership and some House Democrats, the
administration was able to water down and
ultimately defeat the Prevention of Genocide Act. 

While past error is no indication of future
action, the Kurds have not forgotten that
Secretary of State Colin Powell was then the
national security adviser who orchestrated Ronald
Reagan's decision to give Hussein a pass for
gassing the Kurds. Dick Cheney, then a prominent
Republican congressman and now vice president and
the Bush administration's leading Iraq hawk, could
have helped push the sanctions legislation but did
not."



"The Kurds count on the United States to restrain
Turkey, as well as to defend them from Hussein's
vengeance. But they realize that as compared with
NATO ally Turkey, they count for little in
America's larger strategic calculus. They appeal,
therefore, to America's conscience. From Henry
Kissinger's betrayal of their rebellion in the
1970s to George H. W. Bush's decision to snub the
1991 uprising, they have seen the cynical side of
US foreign policy."
