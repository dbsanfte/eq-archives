Hi all....

Ok I work the second shift and am usually not on till 1am EST during
the week. Things as they are on EQ1 (yes - they need to merge servers
already) where even during peak hours it is tough to get a group unless
you are level 70 (at least on Quellious). I have had times where I sat
in Guild Hall for 2 hours with LFG on --- AND THIS WAS ON A SATURDAY
AFTERNOON, kinda peak time.

I started 3 boxing in Vxed, bring my druid (68 200+aa some VT gear)
Necro (67 - 100+ aa) and rogue (65 twink 12aa VT keyed) and let the
necro work his magic. Pull the non-summoning mobs, and he and druid
dot/nuke it down. Rather nice experience, but leads me to the reason I
am posting....

Are there any decent servers, or guilds (on quellious or else where),
that function (Raid late night, or have more people on during these
hours?). Don't get me wrong I think 3 boxing is ok, but really should
be reserved for the few times there trully is nothing else to do, not
just about ever time I log.

Just gets monotonous every night not finding a group, and having to
rely on my necro (was retired) to get us any experience. The few groups
I find are kiting in NC, and I am past that stage on all these chars
(besides vxed is better any way).

I really dont want to pay a fortune to move chars, but it may come down
to this, especially if it will get me in groups with others rather than
playing with myself (pun intended).
