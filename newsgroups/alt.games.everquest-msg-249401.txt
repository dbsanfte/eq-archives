It's used to mgp pred for raids, nothing more (since SoT will bounce
if brells is being used and the rogues never click it off in time).

Actually any class can solo an aa in less than three hours if they've
got the gear (and I am not talking time and above here, more like
VT/ssra for melees and far, far less for casters, who can practically
do it naked), except perhaps rogue. Of those, only rogue warrior and I
guess monk would have trouble doing it in under two. Certain others
have to restrict themselves to certain spots (paladin to veksar or
certain GoD zones for example) and the more convenient spots are
sometimes never available (Deep zonein from Echo side for example).

The trick is finding the right spot, of course. And all of those that
a melee could use will be far slower than a group in a decent place.
But it is possible and not in extreme time frames.
