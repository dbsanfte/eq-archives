I am posting this in the EQ and DAOC group because I think this is the
audience of players who may be considering this product.  This is also
being posted to the comb.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg newsgroup.

The NDA for the Horizons beta ended 12 am PST Thursday December 4.  So
here are a few random thoughts, based on my beta experience up until
about two weeks ago.  The following is not a review, it is an informal
set of:

Casual Horizons Beta Impressions

Pros
1) Premise.  Interesting premise�there is conflict w/ undead, and
races unite to defend land from blight.  Blighted lands are actually a
bit cool.
2) Crafting.  The crafting system is quite dynamic.  Materials must be
collected, from either mobs or as natural resources.  These materials
can only be combined with the proper tools and a knowledge of the
proper formula.  Formulas also drop from mobs, or are acquired through
quests, etc.  Formulas, materials, and finished products are all
tradeable, and pawn shops and consignment merchants are readily
available.  This should lead to an interesting economy.  I found the
crafting system to be much better than DAOC or EQ.
3) Variety of player races.  Interesting variety of races.  Dragons
particularly.  If some races appear to be unoriginal, keep in mind
that they are generally based on conventions that are many years old
in the mudding community, predate EQ, and will be comforting to many
old timers.
4) Outdoor Exploration.  Landscapes are sufficiently diverse.  The
graphics engine, such as it is, is used to its potential.
5) Class System.  There is multiclassing, in a sense, and this will
appeal to many players.  I say "in a sense", because if you switch
classes, you can retain some (but not all) of the abilities of the
previous class.  The line between what abilities you keep, and those
you do not, have shifted a bit during beta, so it is hard to say where
it will wind up for release.  A reasonable guess is that you keep the
abilities up to 1/2 the level of your previous class; so for instance,
a level 10 cleric that switched to mage would keep those cleric spells
up to level 5. Of course, a system of this sort invites a small number
of "uber templates"; during beta, these were unknown because of all
the tweaking and balancing that was going on.  If pressed, I will
predict that cleric/XXX will describe 75 percent of players 3 months
from now.  [Some folk prefer strict class delineations.  I get the
impression that this class structure will appeal more to AC folk than
EQ folk.]
6) No PvP.  For me that is a big plus (and I won't say why for fear of
starting a flame war).  For other players, it will be a big minus�. if
so, just mentally move this point down below�

Cons
1) No pets.  I think pet classes are important in modern games of this
genre.  However, some games have been successful without pets.  I
might expect many varying opinions on this.  Developers hope to add
pets in the future, but of course if they do, then any classes that
get pets will probably get rebalanced.
2) No doors.  This is probably not too serious.  Many games that have
doors don't really use them meaningfully.  But it seems odd to wander
around the buildings in a town and realize the architecture includes
not a single door!  Or did I just miss the towns that do??? I suspect
there is some kind of game engine limitation going on here.
3) No dungeons.  For me, this is rather a large issue.  Dungeons,
castles, crypts, etc. seem integral to the fantasy genre. 
Observations among the beta testers are that the engine cannot handle
pathing around walls and other objects.  This may be the reason for no
indoor/underground areas with mobile monsters or npc's.  I am trying
to remember if I have ever seen npc's walk about any of the towns, for
that matter.
4) Outdated graphics.  The graphics look 2 or 3 years old, in my
opinion.  The resolution, vertices, and ground clutter is clearly
better than EQ, but trees and water are very, very far behind SI or
Atlantis era DAOC.  In fact, the water looks to be from directx 6.0 or
7.0.  Reports on the beta boards seem to indicate that the engine was
licensed (rather than developed in house), like DAOC.  However, unlike
DAOC, the company that developed the engine for Horizons went out of
business (again, according to unconfirmed beta gossip), which could be
a real problem for upscaling and support.
5) No equipment loot.  Actually, this could very well be a positive,
but in my opinion it should be listed as a negative.  The idea is that
mobs will drop coin, crafting components, and formulas.  All else is
crafted (and crafting itself I like, see above).  This will probably
be good for generating a true player economy, with crafters being
integral.  But I rather missed the anticipation of finding some neat,
equip-able stuff off a mob.
6) Exaggerated weapons and equipment.  Seriously, some of those
weapons graphics look truly absurd, in my opinion.  I have seen staffs
(staves?) that look like a ten foot tootsie pop, with a long narrow
shaft and a huuuuuuge red gemstone at the end.  Cartoonishly large
swords and such.  This unnatural scale was an alarming departure from
immersion.
7) Slow textures.  During most of Beta, other players and npc's would
start as grey "cutouts", and appear to "skate" across the landscape
until the textures and model slowly loaded.  This could take several
minutes.  Building textures would also load slowly, so you could enter
a "town" and see npc's floating in air, until the building slowly got
loaded around them.  However, don't rely on this criticism, since I
saw very good improvement toward the end of beta, and it may be that
the problem is completely solved by release (as debugging routines are
phased out and data files condensed).


Conclusion:

I will not buy the game, because it does not meet my own personal
preferences.  However, the game is not a dud, and some people will
enjoy it.  I view it not as a competitor to EQ or even DAOC, but I am
sure it will find a nice niche market.  I predict that the initial
release of the game will generate somewhere around 100,000 "free 30
day" accounts, user reviews will be polarized (crafters the happiest,
PvP'ers the unhappiest), and the community will settle down to around
50,000 fairly loyal customers about 7 months from now.  Depending on
its overhead, the company will probably make some small return to its
investment.   Long term, the company will introduce pets and so forth,
but will be hampered by a graphics engine that they did not develop
(from a contractor that is purportedly out of business) and which will
be hard to scale to meet progressively higher market expectations. 
Also, the challenge of creating meaningful dungeons will be harder
than staff is willing to publicly admit, given the pathing and
collision detection currently in-game.
