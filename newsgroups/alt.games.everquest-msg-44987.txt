    Remember, I'm with the overall minority that wanted no part of any loot
limitations. But 45%, or 48%, or 49.9% does not a majority make.

    Aye, agreed.

    Again, agreed. As I said, I think that's how THEY see it. Two of the
complaints against TCC, and likely two of the only complaints VI regarded as
valid, were that quests would be screwed by this, and that players could
never really get any No Drop gear if they went past the TCC limit for that
gear. Given how many quest items are only No Drop, neither Lore nor Magic,
this implementation comes close to solving both problems neatly.

    I imagine most of the problems *I* have with the code are solved,
according to VI, by the statement "Well, you can always buy it from the low
levels camping it!"  8(

    The way TCC is implemented now, it FEELS like it's being done with one
if statement: if anyone in kill credit party gets no XP, then poof item.
That doesn't sound that hard to code out. Even if it's more complex than
that, it's going to be an isolated routine - it's a triggered event.
