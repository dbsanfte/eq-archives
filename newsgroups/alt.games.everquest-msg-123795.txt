Another way you can be unable to pick something on the ground up... I 
follow this lovely wood elf druid around all the time, and she forages 
constantly and drops 99% of it.  I seriously cut down my food bill by 
retrieving all her droppings and destroying the fishing grubs and 
feathers...  Sometimes, I'll go AFK, come back, and see one of her little 
baggies and be able to pick it up.  I've discovered that when this 
happens, if I cast see invis on myself, I invariably discover that she's 
invisible and sitting on top of it.

Can't recall it ever making me LD tho.
