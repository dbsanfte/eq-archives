I've done tier one POP groups with a 300 point heal plus Stoicism.  2K heal
would have been a wet dream; on slowed tier one mobs (60% slowed, mind you)
300 points was doable, just need KEI and a horse and generous use of
canni+stoicism to keep up... and make sure there's no contact with the mobs
till they get slowed (root and mez and -don't- nuke please!)

Paax, 51 shaman, Morel Thule
(was doing hobgoblins at 50 as sole healer, as well as POJ exit, POD rats
and goos, POI pulling mobs to GY)
