True. But good OOP code does make good coding practices easy.
Incremental and easily testable changes, unified interfaces for data
manipulation, and so on. Certainly OOP isn't necessary for good
programming, but *anything* would be an improvement over the methods
Verant apparently uses. :)

The thing that scares me is that either:

1) They were messing with the faction code for some reason, which
broke this, and they didn't think to test it, or
2) They were messing with something totally unrelated and the code is
so nasty that no one expected it to break the faction messages, and
again they didn't think to test it.

In either case, things like this give me the chills. Thank the gods
it's a game and not an air-traffic control system.

>And I won't even mention that "OOP programming" is redundant.

Hehe. Guilty, but in my defense I'll say: if you write "OOP", the
non-programmer will not have a clue what you're talking about, and in
this acronym-rich group someone might want to know what MOB drops the
OOP. When you stick 'programming' after it, they know they can glaze
over and ignore it.

Ditto, much to my surprise when I worked it out recently in a job
interview. Well, 1989 for me. But still, I'm clearly getting old.
