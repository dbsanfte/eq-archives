I think some religious people have a disproportionate fear of humour because  
they know that the basis of many religious tenets, --that an infinite, 
omniscient, omnipotent God, sole creator of a universe fifteen billion years 
old, thirty billion lightyears across and filled with trillions upon 
trillions of stars, planets, black holes, neutron stars, and wonders we 
don't have names for yet, actually worries about your headgear, what you eat 
on fridays, your facial hair, and which polarity your sex life takes-- is 
actually quite humorous, in the face of it.
