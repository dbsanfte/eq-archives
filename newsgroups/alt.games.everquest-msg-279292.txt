I have a notebook with a 9700/9800 mobility radeon but will soon get a AMD 
64 3,0+ with a 6600gt and 1gb internal memory ddr400.

You see I quit EQ 4 years ago because I started getting headaches from 
playing and maybe that was because I got sensitive and couldn't handle lag 
well.
I started getting headaches sometimes around when the Velious expansion 
came.

Do you still get the bad lag you could sometimes get back then or has that 
improved ?

I understand that on big raids and in very crowded zones you can get bad 
lag - but 0,5 fps ? you must be joking ...

I would have hoped for an estimate or guess ( something like 30-40 fps 
normally  and 10-60 in specific conditions)

I don't know how online games differ from ordinary single player games in 
this respect , if online games use special techniques for making movement 
smooth in "lag situations"
