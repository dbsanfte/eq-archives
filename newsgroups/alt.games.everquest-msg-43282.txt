Uh huh, which would be why I referred the ISDN cards as TA's  Terminal
Adapters and described why 56k modem is that much slower compared to a
single 64k ISDN channel

No, it's a digital signal.

Generaly External modems are considered better, this may be because many of
the early internal modems were software driven not hardware, fine for
browsing but not much use when you're PC is running a game. There is little
difference (if any) between the Diamond Supra 56i (internal hardware) and
the Supra 56e (external)
