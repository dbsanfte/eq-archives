Given the topic of this thread, it is difficult to single out a
"necessary" spell as a cleric.  The problem is that we have a few
important lines of spells with a lot of redundancy built in - each one
in a line of spells accomplishing the same thing in a different
fashion.

DA - Yeah it saves my butt from time to time, but I have DB.  May be a
little more risky to get cast off, but I have a way to get back exp
lost from a death.

CH - Not having CH would make "boss mob" raids a lot more difficult to
deal with.  But since *I* am not up to that level of raiding yet, I
need to question whether I can live without it in a normal exp group. 
Yes, I can.  It may result in less efficient heals, but I can certain
do without it.

Celestial - Right now, this is my most efficient non-CH'ing heal.  But
take this away, and I'll still have a slightly less efficient, but
much quicker heal of nearly the same amount of health.

Rez - It would really suck to not get back all that exp lost from a
50+ death.  It would be bad enough that I would not want to play the
class anymore, given that my only options are the costly necro rez or
the less desirable (and less available on my server) 75% pally rez.

Stun - Helps from time to time, especially for when the enchanter is
getting mez resists and needs some time to get a cast off.  But root
parking would serve this function as well, and would work on the mobs
that cannot be stunned.

Root - Although I always have this memmed, I really don't end up using
this much.  I see great uses for it.  It's great for travelling.  It's
good for when you don't have an enchanter.  It's great for helping the
enchanter.  But I just don't end up casting it very often.

Nukes - Whether undead or not, I just don't end up using nukes very
much.  If I wanted to nuke, I would have chosen a different class at
the character creation screen.


So let's sum up the cleric class for me:  If I was a "boss mob"
raiding class, I suspect the CH would be the one spell I could not
live without.  But since I am not, I would say the number one spell
that I could not lose without losing interest in the character is the
rez.  In particular, the 90 rez.


> Druid: Snare

The snare is great for a druid, but I would argue that the ensare is
more important for the druids I have had experience with.  These are
the quadding druids.  Take away ensnare, and I bet they would
seriously consider choosing another career.  The length of the snare
is important because druids can't snare all mobs at the same time
(AoE) and don't have the nuking power to take down 4 mobs within the
time the level 1 snare lasts.

Now, I could see a different argument being made for druids that solo
with a rotting technique, or those that group.  But, like I said, the
only druids I have experience with are quadding druids.

I completely agree.  A very deadly and diverse arsenal, indeed.


> Wizard: snare... too bad they get it so late in the game

I could live without my wizard's snare.  It would make quadding
require a lot more time, and rule out some mobs altogether.  Snaring
is nice to have, and I do it on every quad.  But those resists sure
get annoying.  Sometimes I get fed up and refuse to snare.  Doing a
full speed quad is doable.  Just gotta have a spell haste 2 focus
item.

Circle of force (level 34 aoe nuke) is a pretty important spell. 
Quadding would not begin until much later in a wizards life, were it
not for this spell.  Sure, you could quad at earlier levels, but
eventually the mobs hp will quickly outgrow the nuking power.

The spell cast by the staff of temperate flux is, in my opinion, one
of the most important spells a wizard has.  It makes pulling so much
easier.  And it is absolutely necessary when quadding in a duo -
soloing gets so boring.

However, for my wizard, the number one spell that he absolutely could
not live without is KEI.  If KEI were not up for sale from the
friendly nexus enchanters, I would have retired my wizard long ago.

Coming in second place behind KEI is spirit of wolf, whether from a PC
or from a potion.  Since I don't have JBoots or Run3, I would not be
able to quad without it.
