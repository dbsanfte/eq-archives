I just got it last night.  The Guild Managment tool is sweet.  You can
findout who are all in your guild, when they were last on, who the officers
of your guild are and post a personal note besdie your name.  It can do more
than that but since I am a low member of my guild I do not have access to
those tools.

The pull up map is REALLY cool.  I cannot comment if it works in all the
zones that SONY has given out maps for but running around the Bazaar
yesterday, the map tool worked perfectly.

The JOURNAL rocks.  No longer will you need to have hundreds of Post-A-Notes
surrounding your computer.  The journal keeps up with All of the
conversations you have had with NPCs.  It makes questing a lot more
enjoyable since the Info is right there and can be pulled up.

I have not played around with the Armor Dying thing.

I have not visisted any of the new Zones yet.

In addition to all of that new stuff I found myself the best dang Barbarian
Warrior UI Skin on the planet.  Here is a link to the website.

You will have to set up an acount but it is free and for anyone who wants to
get away from the stale UI that comes with the game, this site has TONS of
good info on how to create your on Skins and they also have many skins that
can be downloaded.
