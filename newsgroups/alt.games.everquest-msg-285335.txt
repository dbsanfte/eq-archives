Absolutely untrue.  If you do the first point of damage to a mob then you 
get the credit even if you do no more after that.  It has to be damage 
though.  You can pull with a dot or a debuff but not have the tag yet, until 
you do actual damage.  The only way to lose a tag after that is to run away 
or feign death or vanish, or if an NPC makes the kill.
