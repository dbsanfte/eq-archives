I believe you would be best off keeping EQ on the same drive letter as
windows... Kinda tired, cant think straight but I think I'm right
anyways, you got any HDD's laying around, networked computers, or zip drive?
if you have a HDD you shouldnt need anything too big... with both
expansions, my directory is reading as 909 mb... if you get a CD-R or
another small HDD, just arrange the files in your directory by date, the
ones at the top are most recently edited and pack as much as you can, and
just in case make sure you get all your .opt and .ini files
Hope this helps.. btw small HDD's should be really cheap but might be hard
to find =P
if you can get even a 500 mb one, I'm betting that would save you hours

Also - if you dont have any of the above, got any older computers lying
around? could borrow a HDD. Hope this helps
