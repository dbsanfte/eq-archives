True that.

I had a friend that wanted me to take a look at his system since it
was running slow. When I got to his house all I did was look at his
screen with out doing any thing and say "Well I'm pretty sure I know
what your problem is" He said "What?! How can you tell that just by
looking at the screen?" He had 22 icons in his system tray. I said "Umm
do you even know what half these programs are?" He said "Umm
I'm not sure really." exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, etc. System ran fine after
that.
