There you got my main reason for downtimes...
Now add an evil race to that - and most necros have outpost faction in the
Overthere, and solo right outside the outpost, you will only need like
1 minute to bank and maybe 1 more to sell stuff everz once in a while.

And soloing - the xp still IS good until 45, in the overthere....
haven't tried since I hit 45...
