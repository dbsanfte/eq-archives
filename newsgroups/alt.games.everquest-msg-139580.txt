I'm still on Odus right now and was wondering if anyone could recommend
where I should go next.  The Warrens were great (I could get about 8 plat
per run, which is more than I've ever had before), but now I need to find
some white/black or yellow (maybe even red) creatures to get some exp.  I'd
like to go to the Oasis, but the way is long as hell from Odus to East
Antonica...another question is where are the spires on Antonica?  I can get
to the Nexus from Toxx, so if it would save me travelling time to go the the
Nexus and then the Antonica spires, that would be great.

Also, is there a place that gives decent plat drops for my 14 necro?  I've
earned everything on my character now, from both some quests and money from
the Warrens, but have never had more than 50pp at once.  Any suggestions
there?

Thanks for the help,

JD
