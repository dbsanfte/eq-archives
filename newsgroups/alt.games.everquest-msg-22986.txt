<Rant about hacking EQ snipped>

As they say, anything can be hacked. Is it worth the effor enough to
do it? Probably not. IN Win2k you can tab out. Running Softice on the
EQ client will allow some things, if yu know how. By manipulating
client side active memory, CRC's and such are bypassed. What can you
do? Very little, likely. Movement appears to be client side, with
server tracking where you are in incriments. So speed buffs are likely
manipulateable. Changing SoW to Selos speed or the like using existing
client code, with simple module redirectors. Maybe all buffs/debuffs
are client side executed, and server initiated. If they operate on a
timer instead of a server side end of buff notice (smarter, reduces
bandwidth, lets client handle calculations, etc) then you are likely
to be able to remove debuffs, DoT's, etc at will. Maybe tweak the
timer on your Clarity2 to be measured in hours instead of minutes (can
you say perma-clarity? I knew ya could). But, doing these things would
be time consuming, have to be done individualy (no simple hack to
start with EQ) and, frankly, not worth it.  
I suspect I could do some if not all the things above, but have no
inclination to do so. And, the risk of getting caught is unknown. Has
Verant really stopped scanning active processes? Are you certain?
