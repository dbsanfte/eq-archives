    Drops in Kedge Keep. I believe it's the rare drop off Estrella, the
annoying ENC mermaid that you pass close to on your way to Phinigel. I know
I r uber and stuff like that, but I've killed her with me, a bard, and a
druid (all level 60) before. If you check The Bazaar you have a good chance
of seeing one for dirt cheap (as in 1 K or less) as not many people realize
exactly how high it is on the +MANA list. +50 MANA on INT-caster wearable
droppable shoulders is exceptional.
