My best suggestion is to look at the shadowed boot and gloves quests. You
won't be able to kill the shadowed men or the giant skeletons needed for the
quests but you should be able to get whoever is killing them to let you loot
the appropriate things as they are no use to anyone else. And you can get
the other components yourself. I did the quests at about level 25 where I
was no better placed to do those parts.
