There were not spawn points per se. Our 'spawn system' covered something 
like 20 - 30 pages, and we never got it summarized well. Some of the 
ideas have been showed up elsewhere, some have not.

'Farming' was planned to be anti productive compared to just playing the 
game... the methodology was long and complex, and I didn't really work 
on that any. I was more on the 'content guide' side of things: How the 
world worked, how the various parts interrelated in a sensibile way, how 
the world itself was laid out, and the justifications for the locations 
of things.

I do remember we did things on quests like making some of what in EQ 
would be 'named' mobs dynamic. Generally you had to meet a set of 
conditions to spawn it, and then its not going to be a pushover for your 
level 70 Paladin to kill this guy who drops part of a level 30 armor 
quest item. because you spawned him, you are going to have a challenge 
on your hands. Bring friends. (assuming it was designed for group 
work... if it was a soloable encounter.. well you still have to work at it.)

Oh those conditions could change too... iirc. It's been 3 years since I 
looked at this. Or more.

And many of the quests were a 'Oh, thank you again for killing XYZ 
dragon for me, I don't know how to express my gratitude further' (one 
shots, making certain items rarer by default (max 1 per character, 
essentially).
