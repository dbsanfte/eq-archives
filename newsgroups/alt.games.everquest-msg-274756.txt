Let's see, would you start at noon setting up that basketball game with 
friends who live across the country knowing full well that everyone had to 
be at work at 8:00 the next morning?

No, you wouldn't. As a matter of fact, if it were merely to play a 
basketball game together, it wouldn't happen. You would stay where you were 
and play with those nearby. However, if your intent was to facilitate being 
able to play basketball together all the time, then you might just consider 
spending a week or more moving to the same locale.

The fact that it's impractical otherwise doesn't strike you as odd, why 
would that scenario in an *immersive* game be any different? Heck, in the 
game, you cold be there in a couple of hours tops. Sounds like an 
appropriate compromise to me.
