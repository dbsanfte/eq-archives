If calling people who have a different opinion "chicken little" counts
as a refutation, sure.

This patch doesn't necessarily lead to further cheapening, but what
this patch implies about the change in attitude of the game designers
leads one to reasonably suspect that there may be more coming.

Some aspects of these changes clearly indicate to many of us that Sony
is reacting to the bottom line rather than what is good for the game.
That's their prerogative, of course - they're in business to make
money, but 'more popular' often doesn't equate to 'better'.

If the changes stop right here, well and good - no real harm done, and
some valid negatives (spellbook) corrected. But if the apparent policy
to appeal to a wider audience continues to be applied in this way,
Everquest may quite possibly end up as nothing more than garden
variety pablum.

Duh. While you keep arguing against it, no one is actually making the
claim that these changes *must* lead to ruin for the game. We're not
saying it's a certainty, we're alarmed at the possibility. See the
difference?
