Ah, good ole' Scruffy. Be nice to see him get some gameplay if they put
something useful on him. My long abandoned level 25 monk still has
Scruffy's head in the bank, and has had it there since early 2000. 
Never did find a quest that used it. Made me kind of sad. He was the
first "named" I ever took down. When they started naming servers after
NPCs instead of gods, I swore that if they opened up the "Scruffy"
server, I would immediately pay to move all my characters there to play.
