I haven't heard the ring/ling for raid/group leadership points.
Do other folks think they're common enough to warrant inclusion?

This use of "ping" is actually a straight use of computer network
jargon.  (Indeed, on many computers "ping" is the name of a command
that tests a network connection by sending some messages (which are
also sometimes called pings), getting the responses, and reporting
the average roundtrip time and what fraction of messages failed the
round trip.  I think those are the statistics shown in the F11 window.

Again, though I'm familiar with this use of "ping" from other computer
contexts, I haven't heard the word used for this in-game.  Do other
folks hear it enough to warrant inclusion in the glossary?

p.s.: I sense a karmic circle.  Many years ago I was part of a group
of students who collected a glossary of computer jargon, variously
known as the "jargon file" or "hacker's dictionary".
