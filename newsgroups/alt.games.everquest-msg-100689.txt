  While I wouldn't put it precisely the way you have... this is one of my
reasons for not becoming a Guide.  Being an Guide I'm sure isn't all that
easy, and it is a responsibility.  Already, EQ feels to me more like a
responsibility than recreation in many ways (being an officer in a guild,
being there for my friends, feeling the need to keep up with their
advancement so I can continue to be there for them, the research I have to
do in planning raids and other excursions, the tedium of some aspects of
gameplay, ect.)... becoming a Guide can't improve that feeling.

  That, and I like helping people, but I don't like having my hands tied...
which is kind of how the situation is for Guides, from what I've heard.
They don't have a lot of authority and can't do a lot besides write up a
report for a GM and pull a stuck character out of wall.  Being a Guide gives
you access to a few tools you wouldn't otherwise have, but I bet a lot of
the times you feel more limited in the ways you can help people than if you
weren't one.
