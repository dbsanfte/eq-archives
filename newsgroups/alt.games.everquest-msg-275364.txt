Tirranun is part of the recent Lavastorm Mountains revamp.  While he is almost certainly
part of DoN, he went live - along with the new LS -  three weeks before DoN went gold.

He is 75, melees for 1900+ and tosses a 1500DMG fire-based AE.

Tirranun cannot yet be killed by any means that we know of.  If attacked, he becomes
untargetable at 75% HP, and wanders off.

The gamma of the picture on Illia's page does not justice to Tirranun.  Like the rest of
LS, he looks friggin' awesome.

Best regards,
