And not every healer has a mount.  Yesterday I was in a great group in PON.
Enchanter, Monk, Cleric, Rouge, Necro and me, 57 warrior.  Every caster had
a mount and things went smoothly.  Monk pulling mob right to me, I engage,
monk does a quick FD to lose agro, mob hits 90% then caster slows.  If
caster waits until mob is at 90% to slow I have no problem holding agro.
Things went fine.  No down time except for the occasional pee break.  Made
30ish % of 57 in a little over 3 hours.  Then cleric needed to go and we got
a replacement.  Enchanter in grp was 60 and had KEI to give out.  Only thing
was Cleric did not have a mount to ride.  Cleric was 54 and did not even
realise the benfits of having a mount.  We explained them and said the
cheapest mount in the game is around 9Kish.  9K to her seemed to be an
outrageous amount of money.  But at 54 she could easilly come up with that
in about a week or two worth of hunting and farming.  So monk begins
pulling, things go well, I hold agro and mob gets slowed when at 90% health
with no problems.  She heals and then gets summoned but runs back, no
problems.  Then she sits down to med and we begin the Tennislke work of back
and forth running to get mob.

The Monk even asked if I was spamming my Tuant key and I said yes.  Taunt
does create agro even if you still have agro on mob.  I posted earlier in
this forum that if I taunt a mob two or so times before breaking mezz then I
can keep it from going after it's mezzer.
