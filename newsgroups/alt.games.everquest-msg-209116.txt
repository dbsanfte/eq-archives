Well if he put stats into Agility (like I did with my DE Warrior) instead of
Stamina then he'll start to regret as he makes his way thru the low levels,
then he'll probably forget about it as he gets to mid-level and beyond.
Stamina is about the hardest Stat to raise but it's not that hard to keep
above 100.

Confused, you mean he put his starting points into agility or he's made a
point of buying items *just* because they give him agility? Like Serp
Bracers and Mith BP?
I had a conversation in the bazaar about this once. The question was, when
making a new character was it worth sticking a lot or any points into
agility? The answer came back as "Yes, Agility makes you dodge more"...To
which I piped up that it did next to nothing, like most stats. The arguement
was ended by someone pointing out that her "husband has over 200 agility and
he says it makes loads of difference"
Can't argue when someone knows someone else that has over 200 agility and
they say so, can I?
Especially when we are talking about allocating 25 starting points...Gotta
love the Bazaar for conversation.

So anyway, has gone out and spent 20k to become more Agile than an extremely
Agile Mountain Lion that has just spent 5 years at Agile school? Or did he
just put his starting points into Agility?
If the latter then don't worry about it, people get by with Half Elf Druids
and Dark Elf Warriors so I'm sure he'll cope.
