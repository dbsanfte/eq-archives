I used True North I believe, level 1, but same mana cost.  It's not as 
bad as you make it out to be, Serpent Sight (infravision) is a very handy 
spell for a barbarian shaman, and is divination, as is Spirit Sight (see 
invis).  Both of those are level 9 spells, and Serpent Sight in 
particular saw a lot of use.  In addition, the level 1 Flash of Light is 
also Divination, and at 29, you get Ultravision as well as Invis.  And, 
again, being a blind barbarian who grew up in the old days back when 
being blind was a real hindrance, those sight enhancement spells saw 
quite a bit of use.
