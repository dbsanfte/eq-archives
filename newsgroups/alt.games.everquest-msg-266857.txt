Companies of Sony's size tend to keep these things pretty separate, so there
probably was little budget or developer availability impact on EQ1 from EQ2.

I'll get back to this one.

This is probably the biggie (although undoubtedly there will be some people
who assume EQ2 is an expansion to EQ1 and that, therefore, they have to buy
EQ1 first).

Now, back to #4.  I think you are overlooking something: World of Warcraft.
A certain number of people are ready to leave EQ1 for a sufficiently good
new game.  Without EQ2 out there, most of them would probably end up in Wow.
With EQ2, some of those people that would have gone to WoW will end up in
EQ2.

WoW is perhaps the biggest threat to EQ1 in a long time.  SWG was a
different enough genre (Science fiction rather than fantasy) that, even if
it had been flawless it would have limited impact.  DAoC is fantasy, but the
emphasis on PvP rather than raiding limited the impact (and it was early
enough that it was still at the stage where new MMORPGs mostly brought in
new people rather than draw from exisisting games).  CoH is like SWG:
different genre.
