Maybe for you.  Whatever we are fighting, upon first agroing, everybody
gives the MA a heal of whatever spell they got

You know... my level 10 shaman can't keep up with the heals too.. omfg give
shamans cheal at 10!

Seriously though.. you can't Cheal, and your never going to get cheal, you
think getting a 2k heal won't be overpowering?

If a druid could keep a warrior alive in a raid environment (i.e a big
hitting mob) what would be the point of clerics in exp groups?

Like I said, its situational..

druids = jack of all trades, master of none (tho they master snare kiting
and pleveling tho!)  The price you pay for being so versatile, is your not
exceptional in all your skills.

Druids are still pretty damn powerful though (over powered compared to
mages/necros but thats just my opinion)

I don't disagree with that 1 bit.
