I've been playing my lizard monk under the "equip only what you can kill"
rules, and it's worked pretty well so far. Of course, it could be that I
always have a lizard necro duoing partner, or that monks r oobr, or just
that I have really low standards -- I'm not enough of an EQ expert to
really tell for sure.

One issue I've had is that I've still not come up with a satisfactory rule
for what constitutes level appropriate tradeskill items. If all the
components are vendor-buyable, is cash the only requirement? What would
you consider the minimum appropriate level for Velium Fire Wedding Rings?
Opal Steins? Banded? Fine Plate?

I'll also admit that I've grossly violated the "level-appropriate gear"
rule for one instance: tradeskilling. My lizard monk is level 35, has a
base 85 wisdom. If I'd camped every steenken mob I could for wisdom drops,
my wisdom might well be 100? Probably no more than 110 tops. That really
sucks for tradeskillers, and it's one area in the game where I feel that
"the vision" has really screwed over non-casters. So I have my bags of
bazaar-bought wisdom gear (which is often better than what I normally wear)
and put it on when doing combines and remove it immediately after. I'm not
sure how to fix it, other than to just live with the fact that only pure
casters should ever tradeskill. :/

Would I transfer over to the new server? I don't know. My friends are
all on Xev. And what would I do with all my other chars? :)
