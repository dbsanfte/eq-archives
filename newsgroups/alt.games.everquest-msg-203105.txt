Hello,

 I'm glad I posted here because I've gotten some really good responses. And
I have after all only been playing for a month. And as Hanranhan Thornhide
just said I must "now Adapt". Even though my Char is a Wood Elf, I am a
Human, and the best natural skill a Human has is adapting, and for me I
guess I just need to work on that skill.

Mike
