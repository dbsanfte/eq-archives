Hehe I know how you feel. I won a fungus encrusted hammer with my
monk while doing the caller quest in Fungus Grove(great quest btw, never a dull
moment there). It was great to win something that I could immediately
equip and start using. =) I had won stuff before but it was usually for
friends or to sell, I usually won the 'crap no one can use, but might
sell for 100pp to a level 20 stuff.'
