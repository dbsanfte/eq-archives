I simply dont care what others have,before I left EQ1 I was happily
playing with a very nice Canadian(I am German) whom I get to know
in EQ1,for almost 2 years we played together daily,doing mostly 
somewhat outdated content,like strolling around in S'ssra,Sleeper's
tomb,joining the weekly open time raid just for fun,camping the
"Blade of Eclipse" for new members of our mini-guild whom we
already know they would leave for greener grasses. :)

For me a MMORPG is about the people not the stuff,lately  all
that solo content especially in EQ2 attracts the wrong players
for my taste,though I have to say in-game I met a lot of nice people,
its mostly that the SOE forums leave a bitter taste in my mouth and
I fear that SOE is making a big mistake listening to the posters
there.
