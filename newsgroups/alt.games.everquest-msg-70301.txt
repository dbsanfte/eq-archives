> So what were YOU doing last night?


The rest of my group was out wandering Norrath buying Christmas presents so
I went wandering.  Went to the Gnolls in Rathe and bombed the crap out of
the Embalmer.  (By the way, no, there was no one else there...I wouldn't
have done it if someone was camping the guy).  There, payback for that death
at level 13.  Then went and swam around in the lake to try to get swimming
up to 140 while chatting with the shoppers.  From there, we explored the
mountains and killed a couple Giant Skellies.  They look pretty cool!

All in all, a fun night if not a profitable one nor a xp high one.

Anyway, isn't that what it's all about?
