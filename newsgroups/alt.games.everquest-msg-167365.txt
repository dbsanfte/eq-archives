Character, yes. Items, no. For the character transfer, there are 2
drawbacks: First, you will arrive at your new server with no equipment
or coin. Second, it costs $50...

You could probably land a group in there as early as level 7 or 8.

>What are epic levels and alternate advancement?

Not sure about epic levels, haven't heard that term. Epic WEAPONS,
however, are post-50 quested weapons for each class. Each class's epic
has a unique look and "particle effect" as well as stats and a proc
(spell effect, either clicked to activate, permanent as long as the
weapon's weilded, or triggered randomly in melee combat) geared
towards the class. The two oddballs being the monk (their epic is
gloves) and magician (Theirs is a spell that summons the unique
looking weapon whose real power is in the pet it can be activated to
summon).

Alternate advancement is a pool you can divert xp into from level 51
up. Each time the pool is filled, you gain 1 aaxp point, which can be
spent on various abilities. Press "v" to see the list for your class.
They are divided into 3 categories: General, archtype, and class.
First being the same for everybody, second being a sub-category of
classes, third being specific to your class (although there is some
overlap between classes in this category). There are 2 more added with
PoP, but don't ask me to remember the specifics about them offhand.
;-) Planar Advancement and Planar Ability, I think.
