Not that the second independent claus, "include just  enough text of
the original to give a context" does not contain any indication of
where the original text is to be placed in relation to the response.
"[A]t the top of the message," only modifies the first clause and
rightly so, since only allowing quoted text at the top of the message
would completely eliminate in-line comments.

More importantly, people need to stop giving themselves an embolism
over stupid shit. At best, RFC 1855 is an archaic set of *guidelines*
that only the most anal retentive among us ever tried to *enforce*.

Note that I am perfectly happy to consistently bottom post. But,
somehow, the fact that people top post doesn't cause me to lose any
sleep or develop ulcers.
