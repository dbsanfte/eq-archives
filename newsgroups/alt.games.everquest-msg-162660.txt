This one is easy.  IMHO you have 2 choices, and they are going to depend on
how far you plan on taking the necro.  If you are looking to play on your
off time and have no intention of taking the character past 50 - the answer
is an Erudite.  They have the highest intelligence, good starting city (get
out at level 8 thought).  If you are looking to have the necro take over you
EQ time or plan on hitting higher levels - Iksar all the way.  I speak from
personal experience, the exp penality is worth the regeneration.

If you are worried about faction - don't!  There are benifits to being hated
across the world - there are very few places that you can not hunt.  Rangers
/ bards / guards = all fair game.  And Luclin & POP have given you plenty of
other places to sell and bank.
