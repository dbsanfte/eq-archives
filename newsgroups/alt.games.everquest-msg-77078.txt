True, but no reason something can't be both at the same time.

In my book, any change to the game that lowers a PC's effectiveness
is a nerf, whether or not the original capability was by design,
or a result of unintended consequences.

The word "nerf" derives from the Nerf brand of toys,
which consist of soft foam rubber that are designed not to
be able to hurt anyone no matter how hard you hit them with
it -- so it was natural to call a de-fanged weapon in
Everquest a "nerfed" one, and by extension any other
item/ability that had been neutered to some degree.

So bug or not, anything that has been lowered in
effectiveness (from the player's standpoint) can
justifiably be called nerfed.
