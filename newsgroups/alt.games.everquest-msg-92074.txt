I DO NOT recommend this, I just found it very funny when someone pointed it
out to me.  I also don't know his level, so if he's like the SoulBinders
(level 1) it's not going to help you anyway.

Right inside Chardok is some named NPC that cons ready to attack, but
doesn't.  In fact, if you hit him he won't hit back, he'll just say
something funny.  Something like "What did I ever do to you? Ow!  Stop
that!" every time you take a swing.

I don't recommend it 'cause it gets old really fast.
