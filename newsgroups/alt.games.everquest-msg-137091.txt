Killing two birds with one stone more like. New York is the capitalist
centre of the world and the WTC was the figurehead of that. Really, it's
silly arguing this because obviously America took a terrible loss and I
won't argue that. It wasn't just a strike against the USA though.

Yes it does, I agree, but it doesn't help the USA internationally. For some
reason if I voice my opinion of the USA I'm seen as 'the enemy'. Don't
assume I hate it.

I agree, but war on a terrorist group is flawed because it's not limited to
one particular country.
