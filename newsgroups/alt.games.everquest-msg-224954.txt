> Sounds useful.  Very similiar, it appears, to the combat styles in DAoC,

Yes, these look similar to DAoC combat styles, even using the same term
("Opening") to describe the strike opportunity. The thing I enjoyed most
about playing my DAoC Friar was combat styles. Not only where the animations
dazzlingly cool, it was also a lot of fun to have to put some thought into
striking at the right moment in order to build a chain. I had the timing
down perfectly on the Friar's Friend/Banish chain, that was always fun when
you hit it just right and often got oooohs and ahhhs when executed.

I imagine some folks will criticize this for being such an overt "borrowing"
from DAoC, but personally I think it's one of the strengths of EQ that the
developers are willing to look at how other designers have approached
solutions and incorporated those ideas and even enhanced them.
