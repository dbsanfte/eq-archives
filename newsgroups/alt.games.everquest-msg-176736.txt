Perhaps you should investigate fletching a bit more carefully, you can go to
202 on just the vendor bought parts, no smithing or brewing or any other
tradeskill required.  After that, you can make bows, again, no smithing or
brewing necessary.

To get to 202, the last arrow you will be making is, I believe Field Point,
Wood shaft, Ceramic Vane, Large Groove.  The Ceramic Vane makes that arrow
trivial at 202.

It's not really even all that expensive to get to 202.
