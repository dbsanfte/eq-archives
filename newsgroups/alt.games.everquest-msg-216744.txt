/rant=on

So what's the freaking deal with people looking for LDON groups. On
two different evenings, after /ooc'ing for an LDON group without
success for awhile, I decided to take matters into my own hands and
put my own group together. In that time, I've had no less than ten
people group up with me, with the understanding that I'm trying to put
a group together, only to have them say a few minutes later "GTG,
guildie needs me" or some other lame crap.

On more than one occasion, that person is still sitting in the same
zone LFG thirty minutes later.

Tonight I had lined up an enchanter, a rogue, and a warrior, along
with my druid. With that combination in place, we would have been able
to pick up anyone we wanted. The enchanter bailed before she ever even
arrived, and the other two ditched a few minutes later.

Alright, I know that druids aren't popular in LDON groups, but we're
not exactly dead weight, either. And I didn't just suddenly become a
druid after these people agreed to group, obviously - I've told them
all "I'm a 50 druid putting together a group, want to join?" - so if
that's the problem they shouldn't have agreed in the first place.

And what's with that lame-ass blowoff? Don't hand me that pathetic
"guildie needs me" line when it's a load of crap. If I'm still around,
thirty minutes later, and you're sitting alone in the exact same spot
you were when you bailed on the group, no guildie in sight, it's
obvious that you're full of it. Especially when you're hollering for a
group. Guess what Nancy-boy, you had a group and frankly, you don't
deserve another. I hope you sit there till your ass falls off.


/rant=leave it on, what the hell
