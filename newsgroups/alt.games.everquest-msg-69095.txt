Not to rant, but after a week of non stop patching during mine and
"team japan's" prime time, is it really necesarry to bring em down
(4th day in a row) to fix such trivial things?

Oh, female humans were seeing the inside of thier head for a split
second. Servers down 4 hours.  sheesh

However, I'm glad they fixed the MIP button in Options -> Display. I
was wondering why it was staying off, come to find out it was a dead
object haha

Custom Velious helms visiable. Does anyone still have armour files
turned on? In my world everyone is in leather and generic plate, takes
to long to load otherwise.

Kneel and Grovel were switched, never noticed. Looks like kneeling to
me.  /shrug

Oh wells, just my .666 plats
