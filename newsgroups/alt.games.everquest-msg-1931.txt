My point was meant to be ironic as I am sure yours was meant to be
sarcastic.

So you have no pirated software? It's hardly a real insult. Sheesh I have
done much worse that I am more ashamed of than not by a copy of windows.
It looks as if your friend has no problems standing her ground in this one.

Yes, I even replied to it. I was even slightly patronising about his points
but I didn't stoop to calling any of them "lame-ass"

Several? as in "many" I think you are agreeing with me there. I'm not
defending him at all, you have the impression this is solely aimed at you?
Sorry to disappoint you there, although I did expect a reply from you this
sort.
Rather look at the points he makes you are just ripping into him for making
them. He does no better in further posts and so far today has done little
more than complain about the game. I wouldn't go so far as to say he's
trolling but then, in a group as volatile as this one, maybe he his.

Why? Do I bother you?

I wasn't thinking of Lokari or Stanmann when I posted and I certainly wasn't
excluding STJ. I was not attacking or defending any one person I was merely
pointing out how easily these threads start and how tiresome it is.
Oh well, I guess it's however you get your kicks. An arguement that is just
that, a difference of opinion, I can have a slagging match I don't have the
time for.

You know, Biz, you didn't insult me once there? Not that hard to put your
point across saying I'm an idiot, is it?
