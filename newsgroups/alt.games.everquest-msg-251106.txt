Yes but getting out is a pain in the ass. Yelled in PoK for 15 minutes
trying to find a druid willing to port in and get some guldies out. No
luck, even went so far as to send tells to all the un-anon druids I
could find of sufficient level. (All 3 of them at that time of night)
No luck was offering 100pp. Ended up having to buy Gate potions and
run them back to CS.
