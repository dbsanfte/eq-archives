Is it so terribly difficult for you do do a simple search?  Is it your 
intent to sit her and screech "cite" "cite" "cite" until you're blue in the 
face or we get tired of playing with you, and then you can claim victory? 
It's called the English Language, do you speak it?

> So you're saying "mild" is a whole different situation from "weak" but
> "coward" and "vagina" are the same situation?

I'm sorry if that's too nuanced for you.  Any person of reasonable intellect 
should be able to tell that weak and mild are quite different in this usage. 
Any person with reasonable reading comprehension can tell that I am not 
saying that coward and vagina are the same, and that you only intend to set 
that up as a straw-man to cover your own intellectual inadequacies.

You screaming that does not make it so.
