    It's a fringe resist, but when you need it you'll really need it.

    Never think in terms of WIS, think in terms of mana pool. The Shadel
Bandit ring has 55 MANA. Removing the Velium Jasper ring loses you 5 points
of pre-200 WIS, and two points of post-200 WIS. At your level, that's what,
51+12=63 MANA approximately? So this swap will cost you a total of eight
mana. I don't think you'll notice it's gone. :-)

    Cloak is fine. If you find one when you're out in The Grey, you could
swap in that Shissar Scale Cloak (AC 6 WIS/INT 5 MANA 25) for when you solo.

    You have almost no HP gear, thus you have too few HPs. Right now in
non-resist gear and self-buffed (60 cleric, so Aegolism and Blessed Armor of
the Risen) I'm sitting at about 3550 HPs and I'm still not happy. HPs let
you make mistakes, HPs cover where resists fail, and on raids HPs let you
eat yummy mod rods without getting low health aggro. You can never have too
many.

    You get trained. You get lag. You get adds. You have a brain cramp and
mistime your quad. You take the first hit so you don't get bashed mid-Root.
Folks get hit all the time.

    50 AC? It's usually 2.56 AC per DEF point (or some likewise bizarre
number, one above the AC you get per raw AC on items with 200 DEF). You
should get around 35 or so.

    Your AC, for a druid, is OK. Stay with whatever has the most
HPs/resists/MANA.

    Hadden might not be as camped anymore since the new EB necklace quest
came out. You might want to pop in on him every so often, once you get a
time of death on him. After a patch, always assume he dies on server-up. I
know it can be a pain camping him, but I'm a cheap dwarf cleric.
