Hello,

    Myself and 3 friend ar looking to start a new aprty on a differnt server
just to play on night a week or so.  We will play only ot group with each
other and play the game again as beginners from scratch with no twinking,
just to play the game and do quests and the like as a team.  I am looking to
you guys(and gals) for insight as to the best party makeup we can make with
just 4 folks.

My thoughts were as follows:
    Bard, Warrior, Cleric, Druid
    Warrior, Shaman, Druid, Rogue
    Paladin, Shaman, Bard, Wizard

I am open to any suggestions, we even thoght about a 4 man party of Bards,
it the "healing" song stackable? And if so, would that make a heck of a
healing rate with teh 4 of us meleeing and healing at the same time? LOL!

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!
Parry
