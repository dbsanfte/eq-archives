I disagree. Porter stops what he does and responds to taxi call.  Agrees on
price. Stops what he is doing.  Ports to where the portee is.    THEN screws
THEM out of their port?  That doesn't even make sense.
I would hope in the /tell sequence the porter SAYS he wants payment up front. 
Then if portee waits till porter gets there before he bitches I must agree, the
portee never intended to pay the *agreed upon price* to start with.  No
problem.  Disband.  Ignore.  Port out.  End of story.  The portee loses more
than the porter in my opinion.  And even if he bitches about the story /ooc all
he does is make the next porter leery of taking him, too.  I can picture it
now:
Idiot /ooc:  Notschmuck promised to port me for 100 plat and then when he got
here he said I had to pay up front!!! Never ask Notschmuck for a port again!!!
