I would suggest you start working on the clerical quest armor from the
temple of Solusek Ro, the boots in particular are easy (no killing nasty
creatures).  Or barring that, keep your eyes open for anyone making Ornate
Chain or Fine Plate.

Also, start keeping an eye out for +str items, perhaps orc fang earrings if
you don't have +wis earrings already.

You might want to replace one of the banded bracers with a Bracer of
Erollisi (5 ac +5 str, and lighter than banded, fairly cheap) just to help
with the weight limitations.
