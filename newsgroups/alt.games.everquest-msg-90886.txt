There's no real "easy/fast money" schemes in EQ. All ways of making money
involve some level of tedium, be it: mastering trade skills such as Baking,
Jewelry, or Blacksmithing; farming mobs for cash and/or rare drops; or
becoming an equipment merchant who makes shrewd deals in your server's
bazaar-style zone. Really the best thing that anyone can do in EQ to improve
themselves is to level as quickly as possible. It opens up more parts of the
game, and allows you to make money more quickly.
