Mez interrupts casting 100%.  I first noticed this about a year ago
while we were fighting fairly tough mobs of which a third could be
Clerics without anyone who could stun at all (and the mobs had enough
mana for a lot of CHs making the fights long and laborious so the Bard
would mez the mob we were fighting just as it was casting CH which
interrupted the cast every time.
