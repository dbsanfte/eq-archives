I know this is very similar to the way I play after 50 on every
character I have started (only a couple beyond 50 now and another
getting close).  I get a bit bored with the XP grind on any class at
that point for some reason.  Or maybe I just get a bit more fun out
of looking into other areas of game play at that point. I do know
many that keep on XP grinding on to 60, they have much less played
time than either of my high level guys.

As for making 60K a month, my Necro used to make a little over 1K in
a 4 to 5 hour Rathe hunt.  That after gems for steelskin and SOW
potions.  I was off work for a bit last spring and did this M - F
for a few weeks.  Ended up with around 20K and was so bored with EQ
that I took a month off.  When I got back I started a Bard and spent
it all on him.

One thing that made it possible to hunt HG that much and that
productively was the time of day I play.   Many times I was the only
person in the zone for 3 hours.  That alone makes it very easy to
keep pulling the big guys.
