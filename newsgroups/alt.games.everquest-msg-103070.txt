Since my new Windows XP PC had came with Microsoft Office Pro XP which
inclues voice recognition, I had high hopes that this would fulfill EQ's
"voice recognition engine" requirement.  I trained it but no dice.  So, I
guess I need to buy an engine.

Dragon Naturally Speaking goes for around $180 (ouch).  Via Voice is, I
believe, much less expensive.  Anyone with first-hand xp care to offer
advice?
