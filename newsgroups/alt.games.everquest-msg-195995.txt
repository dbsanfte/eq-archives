Well, thats true, I suppose. The implementation was rather sub-par.

My recollection, and of course it is just anecdotal, when playing hybrids
was that I really didnt have any difficulty getting groups until Kunark.

Maybe its just the rose tinted specs playing up. And as for the warrior
thing, I distinctly remember warriors getting multiple buffs because
there WAS no significant damage, hit point or ac difference. Critical
hits, HP boosts, magic resist increases, all came in because warriors
sucked and hybrids were 'god classes'.
