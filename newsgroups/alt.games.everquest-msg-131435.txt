OK, so there you are in a guild.  They run loot on a points
system.  What happens?  Some people have more points
than others; basically they play more so they go to raids more
and accumulate points faster.

They get all the loot they want at those raids.

Meantime, other people don't play as often, or don't go
to raids so much.  So their point totals lag behind.  They
get nothing at raids save the occaisional dribbles that all
the higher point people already have, or have better than.

I'm told (in each of the guilds I've been in) that the idea of
points is to encourage people to go on raids where they
have no chance of winning anything.

Oddly, though, the point system means that for most, even
raids where stuff drops that they -can- use, there is -still-
no chance of winning anything!

While I understand that its nice to have a way to reward say
a cleric for going to Fear by giving him points he can then
use when going to Hate, in practice the system seems to work
the other way around.  I'm less and less eager to go on
raid after raid when I know that I'm not getting anything
no matter what drops.

Mind you I still go on a lot of raids, but I'm not type of
person the point system is designed for; I go to the raids
because I like raids, like the large group interactions,
like doing new things that small groups can't handle.  I also
stop going to raids so much when we keep doing the
same things, even though perhaps if I kept at them I'd
finally start getting the drops there, since I'm not there for
the drops or for the points, but for the novelty and challenge;
if its getting old and we can do it easy I'm losing interest.

IN the meantime, I note that the high point people get
very nicely equipped, then drop out of the guild, since
their level and equipment gets so much better than that
of the rank and file that they want to go do things the
guild itself cant' support?  Why?  Because the good stuff
is concentrated on the few at the top of the heap...who
then leave.

Randomly distributed loot still favors the frequent attendee's
(who have more rolls, so end up with more junk) but does
spread out a bit more so that the rank and file also end up
with some of the toys.  And when Joe Bigbritches up and
leaves, a larger proportion of the toys stay with the guild,
-everyone- would have to desert to see all the loot leave!

I have other objections, particularly some tuned to specific
points plans, but this is at least a start.
