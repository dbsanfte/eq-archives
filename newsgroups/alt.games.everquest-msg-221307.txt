When I re-opened my account last week I first took the nearly naked Chimp to
Echo Caverns to get s few deluxe toolboxes of Dak Tiptopper. In the mutant
area was a mid 20's highly twinked warrioress being powerlevelled by a level
54 cleric. Of course I was leaving a large area around her alone but she
obviously had decided that she was entitled to the entire mutant caverns
area even though it was taking her 5 minutes to kill anything. Maybe she a
RL female hence she was obviously was worth it or something... Anyway I get
the following tell:

"You are so RUDE hunting here, I get XP still yet you get nothing".

WTF? If I was getting nothing would I have been there? I put immediately put
an /ignore on her butobviously she wasn't balanced enough to handle been
ignored as 15 minutes later the Cleric sends a tell saying how it is such a
bad idea to mess with Clerics and I was now on his "do not res list". Second
/ignore for the night followed, but not before supplying a reality check:

"Essence emeralds are real cheap now in case you didn't know."
