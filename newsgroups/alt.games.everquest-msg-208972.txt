I have been with 3 or 4 guilds in my time playing, and I have noticed one
major problem in 99% of the guilds out there ... high level characters are
always getting catered too.  This isn't a bitch fest, all I am seeing is
very few guilds actually get the high end players to take some time and
setup events for 20-40's characters.  One guild that I was with did this
weekly, and the turn around was awesome!  Every single toon that pushed
beyond 40, had no problem with helping the lower levels, most even went
through the week planning their own event for them.  We had tried to plan a
lowbie guild war event with several other guilds, but none would make new
characters for the event (plan was to level the newbie toons to 9th lvl and
then /guildwar in a seldom used zone.)  IMO, the 50+ players have tons of
zones with enough content in them already, most of the 20-40 players I ahve
talked to say the same thing:  /boredom ... it's all the same thing over,
and over, as no one goes to a lot of the old school zones to level anymore
:(

Just my 2.34cents

Good Luck
