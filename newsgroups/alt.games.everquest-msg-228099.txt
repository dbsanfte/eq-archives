Everquest owes a major part of its success on its pvp (aka pk) rules. Look
at how most people choose to play on blue severs. The statistics speak for
themselves. I think its a shame that pvp cant be a part of the game, when
played in a mature way, but theres always going to be that 10% of people
that will spoil it for everyone else.
