I've been noticing something odd with heals on my shaman.

Back when he was using Minor Healing (say, if he had a POTG on so
Inner Fire was disabled) I'd sometimes get no message (a heal for
10 and under, presumably 10) sometimes 11 point heal, sometimes
12 point heal.

Now with Lesser Healing I'm getting 29, 31, 32, 34 and even 36
point heals.

Part of this may be due to leveling up, but most of it is not,
because I'll get the different amounts in a single string of
heals.

I'm using a Turtleshell Helm, which has Improved Healing I; is IH
a random effect like the Reagent Conservation ones?  I thought it
was a straight 10% (which should have made all minor heals 11
pointers)

The effect seems random to me but perhaps there's a cumulative
fractional effect, so the rest of the heal doesn't show up till a
whole number is reached?  I don't think this is correct due to
the larger jumps in the Lesser Healing range, but it was my
thought while using minor healing:

Lets say you have 200 hp max, injured to 100.
Heal for 10.25, you see no message, and are now at 110 with .25
left
Heal again, still no message, 120 with .5 left
Again, no message, 130 with .75 left
Again but this time the remainder adds to the 10.25 to make 11,
so you get message and hit 141.

Another thought is that somehow other focus effects are also
coming into play, and in a random order that sometimes comes out
to a smaller heal than others.  I have an MP II item (black alloy
medallion) and a spell haste item, I think (bracelet of woven
grass... forget just what it does, spell haste right?)

I thought these items stacked, but what if they don't, so that
sometimes the heal is bigger, sometimes its cheaper, and
sometimes its faster to cast?  Since I don't have any way to
accurately judge my mana consumption sensitive enough to see
whether I'm always getting the mana savings, nor time spell casts
to see if they are really faster when the cast time is so short
already, its possible that I'm only getting one or two of the
effects at a time, and the only indicator of this is the varied
HP total off the heal.

Or maybe heals have always been random like this, or perhaps they
recently added in randomness at some point, or hmm, maybe somehow
the game is having my shaman use the AAs my cleric picked and
these are exceptional MHeals?
