Cancel magic (along with Malo line) generates almost no hate.  Pulling 
with a these lower hate lines has long been known by mages as the way
to split pairs that would otherwise come together.

A classic example of this is the old Hole.  The 2 warriors at the front,
along with the left 2nd warrior, would come together if you got prox
aggro or used a small nuke or an arrow.  Malosi on the front right got
him alone every time, however.

The other advantage of these for a mage is that the mob turns immediately
on the pet when it engages, saving our robe wearing butts from a beating.
