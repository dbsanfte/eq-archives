I keep thinking the "skilled player" line is about a player who can
strafe-run for a little added speed.  Of course, that's a pretty low
standard for calling anybody a skilled player, but that's the best any guess
on this has satisfied me so far.  It would sure make for a slow ass horse,
though.  It would explain Verant's not having to alter MOB speeds.  Tons of
baddies move faster than strafe-run speed, and could therefore still catch a
horse if that does turn out to be what they mean.  Of course, level 9 SOW
would also fit the bill . . .
