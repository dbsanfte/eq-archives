Get *behind* the mobs and they'll con indifferent.

The idea is that you're sneaking -- i.e. tiptoeing so quietly
that if you're behind the mob, it doesn't hear you and
thus isn't aware that you're there.  If you're in front of
it, of course, it can still just see you as usual.

*Also*, note that when your skill in Sneak is low, you
will get the message "You have begun to sneak", but you'll
fail more often than not and it won't actually work -- you'll
have to "unsneak" and then try it again when the ability
recycles.  Once you hit Sneak, you can verify if it worked
that time or not by either:

1.  Con a mob that's facing away from you.  If it cons
"indifferent", the Sneak worked (presuming the mob didn't
con indifferent to start with), if it still cons <whatever>,
the Sneak failed and you need to try again.

2.  Try to run a few feet.  If you're crawling along
at half speed, the Sneak worked.  If you're running at
normal speed, the Sneak failed, try again.
