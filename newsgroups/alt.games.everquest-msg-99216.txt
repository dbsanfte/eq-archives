I didn't bother getting my Sk to 60 (hes been like 54 and unplayed since the
day luclin came out) so I havent used death peace, but the only time I've
seen the spell drop so far is in ST from the FA (final named mob in a
sleeper-less tomb)

Sure its 2 chances, but its also big mana to a character with real low Int,
its interuptable, you have to stop running to cast it, it can fizzle.. and
so on and so on.

a few more hp (i dont agree with the better AC comment from my guildies
experiences).. but does that compare to the hundreds, maybe thousends of
damage that stonestance/whirlwind/voidance stops/reduces?   Then the hp from
mend/critical mend?  How does their riposte/block etc skills compare to us?

we're

We don't ever make groups, including when we clear nToV.  The clerics join
together to make a cheal group, the warriors (tanks) go where ever, they
don't need to be grouped cuz we all know the tank order anyway.  Then you
get a group of ksing bastard wizards, a group of monks/rogues trying to
counter ks... all good fun heh.

If were fighting a Maintankable mob (Vindi, Statue, Tormax, Dain) you can't
even guarantee you will have a healer in your group, let alone a cleric..
successful raids are as much about agro control as damage though and people
finally learn that

Btw you really should try Statue, as soon as he's slowed he's a major wuss
