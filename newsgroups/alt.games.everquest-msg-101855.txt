Its an in joke , kudos if you can figure it out. The fact that it spreads is
interesting though.

What lagg does is cause your connection to not respond for a period of time.
Back in the dark ages that caused such interesting words such as
llllllllllllllllag and laaaaaaaaaaaaaaag and laggggggggggggggg to appear
since keyboards have a delay before they assume you wanted a line of
whatever character instead of a single and a slow or interrupted connection
would cause it all the time. Lagg is the word used to describe the
phenomena.
