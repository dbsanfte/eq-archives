Actually your reasons for loving EQs endgame have absolutely nothing to 
do with what I *hate* about EQs endgame.

I have no trouble with a heavy learning curve, I have no trouble with 
failing often.

What I hate about EQs endgame is its exclusivity. The average player 
will not see it & can not see it. Its not because he's not smart enough, 
its not because he can't learn, its not because he isn't willing to 
commit time to beating it..

Its because he isn't in a large enough peer group of regulars to ever 
take it on in the first place.

I like things that are hard to do, I like puzzles, I like challenges... 
I like 3-manning LDoN hards; and I would love it if there was more 
variety in the challenges LDoN delivered.

What I do not like is an encounter that will be 'old' before I get to it 
because I only play 15 hours a week, that by the time I get to it I will 
be unable to find a group of people large enough, that I can 'learn it' 
with. I will either be relegated to 'tag-along' with groups that have 
long since mastered it which removes any challenge for me; I'm just 
along for the ride; and will succeed on the first attempt through no 
real exercise of intelligence on my part... or, for most encounters, I 
will be unable to find a large enough group of people willing to do it 
at all, and will be unable to explore the content at all.

I think there are a large number of ways to test endgame content without 
being uber. For example... mobs poofing on death, or triggers during the 
event not going off can easily be tested with 'dooms godmode'. Far too 
many events and quests in EQ don't ever appear to have been even 'run 
through' to make sure they work.

I agree you need intelligence, but no, you don't need to be an uberguild 
to *test* an endgame encounter. There are otherways of testing its 
functionality.

You may have to fine tune its difficulty a bit, when you watch the 
actual guilds go at it, but in terms of ensuring everything 'works'?? 
No, the dev team should be able to test that.

The spoon-fed portion of the userbase can go play Sims if they can't 
adapt ;)

Well... given that the more casual players should eventually be equipped 
comparably to the power players the difficulty of these encounters would 
be just that: difficult.

Anyway there are 2 solutions:

Make the encounters instanced. That acheives a few objectives:

1) "No zerging" is enforceable
2) Time lockouts are possible if they are desireable. (I think they are 
approrpiate in some cases)
3) So what if they insta-kill them... other players aren't locked out.

Or I suppose you could...

1) Make the stuff no drop. The 'power players' won't have much reason to 
return.

I can think of something more boring: being able to to do nothing in an 
MMORPG that you so desire.

A 65th with decent gear and lots of AA has pretty much nothing to do at 
all unless their is a raid going on he can join. That is sad.

And besides this would **never** happen. Think about it...if the casual 
player eventually levels to the point where he can one group velious 
endgame it won't happen until GoD endgame is very old news. By that 
point he still won't be able to do GoD endgame... and the modern endgame 
will be 10 expansions beyond GoD, and *lightyears* beyond *him*.

I think you are envisioning people being able to solo the endgame 
*while* its the endgame. That is not what I'm suggesting...

Those 3 things were major circa 1985.

Previous to that **before** DOS was already entrenched; then yes... the 
wide open system was the most important thing to the IBM PC (& 
compatibles) success... primarily because the competition made cheaper 
systems available to consumers.

But this has nothing to do with the EQ vs WoW situation...
