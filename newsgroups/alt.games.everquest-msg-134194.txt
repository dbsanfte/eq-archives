Substitute D for S.
Substitute sleep for caffeine.

(NOTE-  "the PC crowd"!?!  Talk about labelling people with
prejudice!)

That is correct as written.   The specific anti-discrimination laws
only protect against certain forms of discrimination, not all.  For
example, baning discrimination based on sexual orientation does little
to stop discrimination based on gender.  "The law" as a whole should
prohibit all forms of discrimination, but specific parts do not.

> SO, are you saying that there are GOOD forms of discrimination???

You tell me.   Do you want minors barred from sex clubs?  Do you think
a service group for women who have been raped should be allowed to
hire only women?  Do you think its right that an 18yo (a legal adult
in Canada) can't drink until 19?  Do you think a convicted criminal in
jail should be able to vote?   Should someone be allowed to preach a
religious view which actively promotes violence?   Etc....

This is a whole other debate, but not a clear-cut one.  There have
been court rulings stating that "justifiable discrimination" does
exist.

No one needs to be left out.  It *is* possible to compile (and thus
ban) a list of all forms of discrimination.  If not for very vocal
groups opposing "special rights" and/or opposing giving rights to
certain types of people, this would have been done long ago.  For now
I am grateful that ALL people have legal protection from some types of
discrimination- its far better than nothing.  I hope things will
continue to improve.  I am realistic enough to know that
anti-discrimination laws will need to become much more comprehensive
and complex before society changes enough that they become redundant
(and thus can be reduced to more generic statements).  The changes I
have witnessed in the last ten years are more than enough to convince
me of the direct positive impact of these laws.

To quote a former co-worker who used a wheelchair, "Don't tell me to
stop talking about my needs.  When I can take a piss in this so-called
accessible building without fine manoeuvres worthy NASA I'll shut up."
