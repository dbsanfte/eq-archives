I guess it depends on what you call a 'rant'.

Yes..

That may be intentional. It depends on the rant. Fanatics tend to look
down on dissenting opinions (and make it clear they do), and from what
I glean from your posts your idea of a rant would tend to come from a
fanatic.

What, a rant that doesn't come off as arrogant?
