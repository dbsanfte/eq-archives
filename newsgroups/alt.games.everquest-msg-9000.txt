like other then you, will not help us achieve that goal.


If you have any further questions please do not feel free to email us again,
or

537-0898.

Customer satisfaction is our lowest priority.  We would appreciate your
feedback on the level of service provided if we cared at all.  Please feel
free to share your thoughts and concerns by sending an email to other then
