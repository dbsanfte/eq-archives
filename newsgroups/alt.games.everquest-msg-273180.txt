Ok, call me dense, but I just realized that there is a difference between 
tradeskill and wholesaler societies, but I still don't completely 
understand it all.

Certain societies just wouldn't let me join when I approached. I now 
understand those to be the class specific tradeskill societies. The 
societies I *have* been able to join prior to tradeskill level 10 on 
various characters, must have been wholesaler societies.

Aside from the specialization and level difference aspects, what's the 
difference between the two? Are the class specifice society instances 
pretty much the same as the wholesaler instances regarding functionality 
and the way quests are offered?

Lastly, as I understand it, each trade society will grow (in status? 
viability?) as more members complete tradeskill quests and reach higher 
levels, making more quests and tradeskill recipes/components available 
there. Does that just mean that the higher level craftsmen will see higher 
level stuff on the tradeskill merchants and receive higher level quests? 
Otherwise is this standing displayed anywhere? Is there any reason to 
choose one society over another?
