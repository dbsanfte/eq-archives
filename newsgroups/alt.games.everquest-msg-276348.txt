Each of these three named are on the same kind of progressive placeholder 
cycle. You come into the workshops and there are regular skeleton mobs 
without any suffix. Kill them and the tomes they guard and then wait. 
Fifteen minutes later a second spawn of mobs appears and there's a 50% 
chance that they will bear the suffix "replacement". Kill them and the tomes 
they guard. Fifteen minutes later another wave appears and if the last were 
"replacement", then there's a 50% chance that another wave bearing the 
suffix "enraged" will spawn. Kill them and their tomes. Fifteen minutes 
later another wave will spawn and if the last were "enraged" then there's a 
50% chance that along with that wave of enraged, the named will spawn inside 
the curtained room as a separate encounter. It's critical that you NOT be 
inside the curtained room during this camp, you must remain in the workshop 
clearing the waves until your named pops in the curtained room. Then run in 
and kill him. Repeat and rinse for all three rooms to kill Thimzem, Et'sipe 
and Erbmys. You must get to the enraged cycle to pop the named, and because 
it's still only a 50% chance of advancing each time, the camp can take any 
amount of time, depending on what pops. I've walked into rooms with enraged 
up and bingo, one cycle to go. And I've sat for hours clearing intermediate 
cycles ...

What probably happened in your case that was that they were on the Ci'Re 
cycle, and were fighting the enraged wave and you guys ran into the 
curtained room and killed Ci'Re, who had popped with that wave of enraged. 
Yep, they had a right to be pissed if they'd been there camping the cycle 
and you walked in and took Ci'Re.
