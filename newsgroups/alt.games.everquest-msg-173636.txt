Bleh, hadn't noticed that since I just dinged 52 yesterday and got some
safety exp so I could keep level after a 90% exp rez then going to bed.

I've done loads and loads of charming while swarmkiting for 20 levels now,
and I've never had a charisma over 100. I've also used lull hundreds of times
and had 1 single resist where I got aggro in all that time.

I'm firmly in the "charisma doesn't matter" school even after that recentish
patch.
