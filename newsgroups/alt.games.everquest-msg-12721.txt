Oasis? not for long, too many lamers there
Befallen?  semi-regularly, but I don't know what you're talking about
trains, I'm usually the only one in the zone besides a high level camping
the ring for the Paw of Opalla quest, and they can easily handle just about
anything that somebody pulls to the zone (unless theres some uber high level
KOS to all guy like there is in Xorbb)
WC?  ok, how do you get trained in a zone like this where theres a big long
zone border to cross, and nothing that could kill a level 19 who isnt KOS to
the major NPCs (besides griffins, but theyre easy to see coming from a LONG
way off)

Also, I COULDN'T move and zone anyways, I was about halfway through a
bandage when I saw the dorf and was dead before I could finish, and even
though I saw him coming, I didn't have nearly enough time to con him and
notice that  "Oh, that guy wants my head on a platter, I had better run",  I
had Spirit of Wolf on at the time too, so I technically could've outrun the
guy.

And yes, the level 11 wasn't in a good spot, but I used to kill the goblins
at 7 there so its not that bad, I wasn't defending him or anything, just
mentioning that he got blasted away (and lost his level) as well as me.
