    Ok, so you're using the distance to avoid healing yourself. Fair enough.
I never had a problem with waiting until the end of the kill to heal, or
dropping a single heal on myself over the course of the fight. What're ye
wearin', Bergh, tin foil? And to deflect the "but ur uber" charges, that was
back at low levels like 35 and 44, when I was just another ghetto HP cleric.

    Ok, so you don't really give a damn how slowly you kill stuff as long as
the wash gets done. Fair enough, but for those of us that would like to get
that AA point some time this year efficiency is a big issue. ;-)

    "Down time" = "time not spent getting XP". If you've found a neat way to
spend your down time so it isn't a complete waste of your life, more power
to you. I read People magazine while waiting for an alt to med up. But I
don't pretend that reading People magazine is helping me achieve the next
goal I have in EQ.

    It's also great if you need to go AFK for an extended period of time,
like to the store. Racial hide used to be the AFK method of choice for a
cleric. Now, it's all about the Faithstone.
