  Offtopic tangent here, but do you really know the details of that
suit?  The media grabbed hold of that one and ran off in to the
sunset, so there's a good chance you don't.  McDonalds knew for years
that their coffee was dangerously hot, served in excess of 180 degrees
and that it would sometimes cause burning of the mouth and throat.  In
the case in question, the elderly woman who opened her coffee was a
passenger in a parked car.  When she spilled the coffee it spilled
over her thighs and groin, causing 3rd degree burns.  Third degree
burns from a coffee spill (a mistake anyone could make) is a bit much,
especially when McDonald's knew they were serving coffee at
temperatures far hotter than what comes out of your home coffee maker.
She attempted to settle with McDonald's for a far more modest sum (the
cost of the medical bills) but they wouldn't.

  In the following suit, the jury found McDonald's partially liable
and awarded the several million dollar sum you've so often heard
quoted.  This was appealed and the amount was significantly reduced,
and eventually they settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.

  Though it wasn't the wisest thing to open a cup of hot coffee
between her legs... give me a break.  I don't think this is an example
of a deficient legal system or how overzealous Americans can be about
suing.  I personally take it as an example of how inconsiderate and
stubborn corporate America can sometimes be.  :)
