That's exactly why it's rude,  though.  He's forcing a response from you,
which he really has no right to do.  If he's asking for something in /ooc
and gets no response, there are several possible reasons for that, all of
which indicate that I'd prefer not to respond. Trying to force a response
from me only takes away whatever goodwill I was feeling  and makes me much
less likely give him what he wants.  Sorry, but if your asking for favors
you've got to be nice about it and you've got to accept that no answer is a
valid response.
