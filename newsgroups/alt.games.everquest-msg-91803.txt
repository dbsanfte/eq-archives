Apparently the DaoC level curve goes insane at level 40+, there's a
huge number of posts about this fact. At that point in time a 50% xp
res or a 10% level loss may not be so acceptable.

Personally I like the fact that, in EQ, when I get to the point at
which I am playing against the big mobs, where death will happen, I
will not be heavily penalized for the inevitable.
