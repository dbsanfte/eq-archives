Sorry to be blunt, but it sounds like you're fucked.  Time for a reformat &
reinstall.

Before reformatting copy your c:\windows\favorites folder to a floppy disk.
Do the same with anything (except programs) that you can't replace in your
My Documents folder.  Hmmm, might want to save your *.txt and *.opt files in
your EQ folder as well.

Don't bother making a boot disk...it may carry over the infection.  If you
don't have one from a while ago then I'd recommend one of two things.
First, go to any nearby locally owned computer store and politely ask them
if they wouldn't mind making you a good boot disk.

If that doesn't work, or you would rather not do that first, then hopefully
you have a computer that's pretty new (last year or so).  All the newer
computers can boot from CD-ROM.

Restart your computer in DOS mode if you can.
At the C:\> prompt, type
format c:   & hit enter
It'll ask you if you're sure...say yes.

After that's done, put the Win98/ME/2k CD-ROM in the drive & reboot.  With
any luck it'll come back asking you if you want to boot from CD or HD...tell
it CD.  The next menu will ask you if you want to install Win9x, drop to DOS
with CD-ROM support, or just a DOS prompt.  Tell it to install.

Have your original sound & video drivers handy...you'll need them after the
operating system loads.  After those drivers are installed do whatever you
need to do to get connected to the internet (there are so many different
ways that I can't be more specific).

Click Start >> Windows Update.  Get the latest critical patches.   After
installed & rebooted do it again and get DirectX8a.

Then install your AV software and go to their website & download the latest
patches & virus definitions (aka signatures).

Then go to your video and sound card manufacturers and download & install
those drivers.

Now your computer is getting close to being "human" again. :)  Reinstall EQ
& get all the patches...even with cable modem this'll take a while!

RUN EQ and make sure everything's working ok.
IF IT IS, copy the contents of your floppy disks onto an empty directory on
your hard drive (easiest would be to make one on your desktop).  SCAN that
folder for viruses.  If none show you should be able to safely move all
those files back into their respective folders.

RUN EQ again to make sure this is the case.  If so, great!

If not, you're fucked again.  Go back to the top & do everything again, but
count those EQ files gone...and don't open anything else on that floppy for
a minimum of a month and make sure you have the very latest virus
definitions before scanning them again.
