It depends - here in the UK, VAT (tax) is so high that if you live
OUTSIDE the UK, the VAT removal usually covers the cost of shipping.

A friend in the US pays more or less the same as I do (in the uk) when
purchasing from Amazon as the VAT is roughly the same as shipping
costs to the US.

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
