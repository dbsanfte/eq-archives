I'm connected through a DSL/Cable modem (Linksys) router which is networking
all my computers.  I have no problem.

My only question is why a router built for a 3Mbps connection supports 253
computers.  That would end up 12Kbps each, or each feeling like something
between a 14.4 speed and 9.6 speed dialup modem (assuming all downloading at
the same time).
