I certainly did not think monk tanking was broken ;) What I really think
this means is that they decided to stick there head in the sand about ac not
doing anything after 1100 or so and instead of fixing the basic problem they
are nerfing monks . Since monks where balanced well already this is gonna
cause weirdness. The warrior group is one of the largest though , so when
they whine it gets heard.

I feel for the weezards but they damn well brought it on themselves.

The cleric class which desperately needs a serious working over with the
nerf bat got off light as usual .

The mod rods going bye bye just sucks :(
