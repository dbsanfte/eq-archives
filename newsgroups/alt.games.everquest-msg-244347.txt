Not to a Baltcon, but I have been to other cons. I gafiated a number of 
years ago, but another friend on the bujold list wanted to go and we can 
carpool together and stay at a friends house there and avoid the hotel 
costs, so I decided to scrounge the money together to go. Only thing I 
am worried about is EQ withdrawl <grin>

I like a number of the people going, authors and artists mainly, and am 
planning on doing one of the costuming contests, and the regency ball. I 
might even squeeze out a few dollars for some more art=)
