freeware great browsing/converting/slideshow program.

Essentially you just install it and have it set to view bmps, jpgs,
etc then you just target your first one in your dir to view it and hit
the space bar to cycle through them all. If you hit enter so its full
screen, they all are full screen. Backspace backs it up. you can also
just set it to play them all as a slideshow.

I love this program, it does great resampling also (the best way to
resize graphics for using in web pages etc)
