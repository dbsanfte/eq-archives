   Give it back!  Thief.  Rogue!

  I dunno, but I also have just about zero desire to play a vah shir.  Maybe
it's because they run funny.  /shrug.

  I would say go human if that is what you really want to do.  With the human
dark sight thing being tweaked it might not be as bad as you remember. 
Personally I would go dark elf, but then I find myself being drawn more to
fashion these days.

   Too bad half elves can't be rogues.  Or can they?
