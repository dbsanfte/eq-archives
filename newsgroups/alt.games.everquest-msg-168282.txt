}There is also a cap to total amount of haste allowed, I believe 100% (but
}wouldn't swear to that.)

The cap is apparently 100% at level 60.  There are rumors that it scales 
with level, but I haven't found any info as to how, or if it perhaps goes 
up post 60.

}Now if someone could offer similar information about slows...

Heh. That's on my 'to do' list. :) Basic rule: Slows never stack, and the 
shaman's slow is slower than whatever else ya got.

And nothing slows Vindi.  Not even Spine Break, despite what allakhazam's 
says.  Dammit. :)
