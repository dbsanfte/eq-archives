I was over my friends house (my god, I left the house???) watching her play
EQ. She was over in BB, so I told her about the beggar. She went to the
docks, gave him something (a ration, I think), and he started following her
around. She was then asked to do a corpse search (she be a bard), and the
beggar followed her all over the zone.

Then something strange happened. About 10 minutes of following her around,
the beggar started yelling "thief, thief" and attacked her! Considering she
is a lvl 52 bard, she dispatched him rather quickly. No faction hits, and
the nearby guards didn't seem to care. Maybe they are tired of the little
beggar too ..........
