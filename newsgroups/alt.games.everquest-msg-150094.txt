Sorry, but you're wrong.   Dual wield is checked when the off hand delay
recycles.  Your two hands are completely independent of each other.

If you want to prove it to yourself, get a nice slow main hand weapon like a
wurmslayer. Then put your jade mace into your off hand, and watch your
attacks.  You'll get two off hand attack rounds in between your main hand
attack rounds.
