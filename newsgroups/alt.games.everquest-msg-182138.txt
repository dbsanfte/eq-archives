Well, went on a bit of a road trip last night.  Took my high elf wizard to
Luclin.  Visited the Bazaar and PC.  While I can see I'm living in utter
poverty, I'm not sure I have the patience for the Bazaar.  What they need
are brokers in all the cities.  You go to the broker and place your order
and price point.  Barring EQ putting something into the game, a guild could
be built on this.  The guild takes the order, contacts their guy on the
"floor of the exchange", and the item is purchased.  The item is brought by
runner to the city of the order.  The buyer pays the broker fee up front (a
small percentage), and pays for the goods when they arrive.  If the broker
can't get the goods within the agreed price range, the broker fee is
returned, otherwise it is not refunded if the buyer decides not to take the
goods.  Perhaps this all sounds a bit familiar.  Think NYSE.

As for Paludal, I stuck my nose in and got it bitten off.  I went to con
this little 3 ft midget hiding in the corner of a small building near the
entrance, and about four seconds later I'm laying on the ground, a bloody,
and quite dead, pulp.  Guess they don't like High Elves.  Maybe they don't
like anybody, but I know they didn't like me.  Perhaps Paludal is not the
best place to solo a High Elf wizard.  Good thing I had bound myself near
the entrance.

Cheers,
Eric
