just shows it's not a good idea to stop a patch halfway through :) ... I'd
have thought it would detect the filesize being wrong and grab the file
again <shrug> ... strange that VI said they were releasing the files over a
6 day period and in fact they released the first one that day ... then the
rest on patch day (nicely spread out huh?) ... a nice 20Mb+ download on
patch day for my ageing 56k modem

try deleting the file for type 20 that you cancelled the download of ....
the patch program should detect that it's missing and re-download it.
