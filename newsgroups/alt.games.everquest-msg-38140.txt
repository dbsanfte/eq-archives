They can't be identified, but the higher-level blank pages will sell for
more at the merchant than the lower-level ones.

When I was doing research, I'd try for skill-ups with duplicate pages or
with pages for spells that weren't research-only.  When I reached the level
where I got new spells, if my skill wasn't maxed out, I'd dump in points at
the trainer until I was.  Then I researched them myself.
