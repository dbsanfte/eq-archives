Were you both working position to your advantage?  That is, were you
standing on top of the mob with the Paladin staying as far back as he
could and still hit it?  Most (all?) undead mobs seem to have a pretty
large proximity agro modifier, which would allow your Warrior to hold
agro even when the Paladin was getting a bit higher in total hate (say
from the occasional Instrument of Nife proc).  That higher hate would
give your Taunt something to build on.  In fact, I wonder if you'd get
the same results by Taunting situationally (once or twice after each
proc message from the Paladin's buff and/or weapon) rather than all
the time.
