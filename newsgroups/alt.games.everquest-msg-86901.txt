Last weekend, we did Ixiblat Fer for me.

I tried to bind myself in Burned Woods by the zoneline for Skyfire. Got
the message that said "You feel yourself bind to the area" (and it's in
my log- I checked).

TPW on the first attempt. Somethng about the MA rushing forward to
attack, and being out of range of the healers, and then everyone else
going down REAL fast.

I come to in Great Divide, outside Thurgadin where I was bound earlier.
Umm, I needed a ride back to help with the CR for everyone else. At this
point, had anyone asked, I probably could have given a rez while waiting
for a rez.

I got a port instead, and ran around rezzing folks when I got back to my
corpse.

We did kill Ixiblat on the second try. And Third.

Tried to bind myself again, in the same spot or near it. Same message
"You feel yourself bind to the area". We went hunting in Skyfire. Got an
overpull. I gated. 

Came to in Great Divide again. Sigh. Apparently, it's a known bug with
the zone. Be alert.
