You could trade one of your good bags to a trusted friend who has
an open slot (note that it will have to be empty), pull the crappy 
bag to inventory and destroy, then trade your good bag back.

But yeah, it's damn annoying that the item on the overflow slot can't
be destroyed or pulled to the trade window.
