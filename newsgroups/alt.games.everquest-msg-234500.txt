Actually, when you make a character, there will be a rating that tells 
you how hard it is to play. It will include faction as well as how hard 
the class is.

Dwarven warrior, high elf cleric, halfling druid- these are probably the 
easiest out there. I've also never played any of them past level 5 
because they bored me.
