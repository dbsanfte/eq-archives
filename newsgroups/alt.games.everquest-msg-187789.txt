    So you don't know how the ZEM is applied (no knowledge of formula). You
don't know that there's not a default ZEM. But you still claim you know what
a ZEM means? At this point I don't know if you know how to find your own ass
with both hands, especially when you...

    .... post two links where only ONE even has reference to ZEM, and it
isn't you talking about it.

    The first post is talking about raid XP, and doesn't even reference the
ZEM. Although it does have the words "zones", "experience", and "modifier"
in it so I can see why your pathetic search for justification would bring it
up. The second post is brilliant irony, as not only does someone get it
right *AND YOU TRY TO CORRECT THEM*, but it has you doing what I'm
supposedly doing - reading into someone else's statement. Why the fuck
should I flame you when you're so damned willing to flame yourself?

    I was. Here you went and came up with better reasons why you're a moron
than I did. =(

    "I knew a ZEM gave more experience, in the context of the default. Well,
I believed that, even though it was totally wrong on all particulars." Would
that be an accurate paraphrase of your position in the thread piece above?

    Ah, an actual point! Now if only it were true. People do ask which zones
have the largest ZEM, in the context of wanting the greatest possible XP per
kill. But people don't assume that there's a default ZEM, that a zero ZEM
has meaning, or any of the other misconceptions you've had in this thread.
They don't assume they know anything other than bigger equals better, which
is correct. Nor do they lash out when someone corrects them, as you have.

    Good lord, you're so dense it's amazing. You have absolutely no clue how
to respond to that, so you just carry on like declaring yourself the proud
holder of "The Big W" will make people suddenly respect you. /boggle

    The formula is the issue, because you made it the issue. You flamed
someone for correcting your misunderstanding by showing you the formula.

    You might want to look at the previous posts before declaring who is an
"asshole". This post of mine is snippy, for sure, but I think if you compare
your writing style and my own you might find that you're the one more prone
to ad hominems.

    Yes, please do. Post more links!!!
