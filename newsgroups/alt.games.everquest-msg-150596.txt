Certainly not restricted to Tunare...seen all to often in EC (pre Bazaar)
and Qeynos, they always had over elaborate names, that often came out
misspelt, Decipels of Terror is still my favourite.

Last new Guild I saw being touted in the Nexus had a name close to two of
the teir 1 guilds on Bristlebane (we don't have "ubers" as such) something
like "Legends of Valor" Circle of Legends and Ring of Valor being the two
that drew the comparison.
After much ribbing about this, several High level players (and members of
teir one guilds) announced they would willingly leave their guilds and join
but only if the Guild was called "United Ring of Arch Fu Legends" as far as
I know Legends of Valor was never created, or at least not with that name.
