If I remember right, even before Kunark came out, the oldest servers
were hitting 2500 peaks. Fennin Ro, Veeshan and Tarew Marr definately
hit those numbers some days. Brad originally said they planned on 1500
max per server but later amended that to meaning that was what they
hoped the servers could technically support, not a customer comfort
level of service. As they added more and more expansions the
overcrowding was reduced considerably and now you even see people
complaining that people are too spread out.
