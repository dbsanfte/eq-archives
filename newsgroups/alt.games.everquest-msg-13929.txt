That's the problem in a nutshell. The police or federal authorities won't
investigate. Verant won't investigate. And when someone says, "I never gave it
out!" people Like Lokari says, "Well, I don't believe you so therefore it
didn't happen like YOU said."

The amusing part here is someone actually said that the "Internet" could
investigate these claims. (I don't know the phone company for the Internet
Police Department, but that is another story.) However, whenever someone claims
that their password was secure, the ostriches in here immediately chant their
mantra of, "I didn't happen that way. You must have given it out. All stolen
passwords are given out. Case closed."

Interesting variation happened on UO. Someone got banned for duplicating items.
(I believe it was closed barrels, which are a rare item with no use. Instead of
interesting game play, the UO dev team has stagnated into giving out new rare
items that can't be used as anything other than something to brag about
having.) The UO investigators who did the research said that because the
account which did the duplicating did it from a network address that was
similar to his, it must have been him doing it. Case closed. He argued about
how he is at a University, all dorm rooms are wired, and the duping could have
been any of his friends. (The barrels were left in his house, which was a
public house.) OSI (people who run UO) said that the fact they were in his
house and the duplication came from somewhere in the same dorm meant he "knew
the items were duped."

OSI ignored the fact that he items were duped on a different account. They
ignored the fact that the account played from a different location. They
ignored the fact that the house they were left in was a public one where any of
his guildmates could have left them locked down. They ignored all of this and
said, "You must have known they were duped even if you didn't do it."

When someone is guilty because you decree it must have happened the way you say
without any evidence to support you, it is garbage. When someone says your
password was lost via the way THEY say it happened, without any proof to refute
your statements, it stinks just as bad.

Like verant is going to admit that accounts get stolen via external sources?
The problem is that the second they do that, people will want some kind of
protection from such, and there is none to be given. The nature of the beast is
that If you transmit the same password to the same address with the same
headers, your password is protected only by the combination of 1. lack of
knowledge as to what is being transmitted (accounts which can be stolen and no
one will ever investigate how it was stolen); 2. lack of knowledge as to how to
operate this easy to use software (there is not a single sys admin who doesn't
know about sniffers, and I doubt there are many support techies that haven't
played with them); 3. the honesty of the people involved (that is a reassuring
thought, huh?); 4. the risk of getting caught (zero, as if your password gets
stolen, it MUST be because YOU gave it out!)

Verant has already demonstrated that they can't introduce an encryption scheme
that stands up to more than a day or two of attack. (Why someone would come
into this forum and say hackers have bigger fish to fry than stolen EQ accounts
when they know that the EQ encryption scheme is being cracked for whim....
*shrug*) 

To the people who this happens to, you are a gazelle. You just happen to be the
gazelle that the lion got. Tuff break. Life goes on for everybody else, and
Verant is only out a few bucks a month...
