It shouldn't be a 1k harmtouch if the mob is only 55th lvl, probably
under 700. I'd agree that your husband shouldn't take the HT (but at
least he's got the right attitude to play a shaman <g>), it wouldn't
leave him much margin for error on a resisted slow. Tag the mob with
Malosini, sent in pet then  slow to pull him off of pet would be my
plan. Shaman might still eat the HT but at least you'd have a good
shot of having him in camp and slowed by then.
