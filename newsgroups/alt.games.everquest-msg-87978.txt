From EQ's page in a sec,  but I believe you also get it if you're using
DX8.0a instead of the required 8.1

"No 3D Device Found" Error

If you are receiving the "No 3D device found" error then you will want to
run the DirectX diagnostic tool. Clicking on Run from your Start menu and
typing "dxdiag" does this. After the DirectX Diagnostic Tool loads, click on
the Display tab. Voodoo1/Voodoo2 card users will select the Display2 tab.
Under the section labeled DirectX Features, you should see two entries. The
first is DirectDraw and the second is Direct3D. Make sure both are listed as
"Acceleration Enabled". If they are not, click the Enable button to the
right of the respective entry. If there is no Direct3D available, or the
Enable button is grayed out, your video card is not capable of using
Direct3D and you will not be able to play the game with this hardware.
Please refer to the Video FAQ available at http://www.everquest.com for the
list of supported video cards.

If your video card is listed as being supported and you are still showing a
"No 3D device found" error, please make sure you are using the latest
drivers. Also, right click on the My Computer icon, left click on
Properties, then select the Performance tab. Left click on the Graphics
button, and make sure the slider bar is set to full (all the way to the
right).
