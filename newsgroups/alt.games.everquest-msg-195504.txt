Out in Shadeweaver there's a guy who gives armor quests, in each case collect
four of an item to get a specific armor piece.  Its Leather quality stuff and
ever piece has a HP bonus.  My beastlord had most of a full set of the stuff
and the HP added up nicely (on a non twink)

I'm not certain that any other classes can wear it, but I -think- its all Vah
Shir wearable.

The lute is part of the bard version of the vah shir sonic wolf weapon quest.
The other items from the quest were pretty much lowbie junk, I was just doing
them for the fun of it when I stumbled into that lute.

I haven't done any of the new armor quests they've given so many races, but I
have the impression they were patterned after the Vah Shir armor quest series;
race specific gear quests designed to keep you in your own newbie area, instead
of having everyone go to everfrost because thats the best place to level up (or
Paineel or wherever the latest hot spot for newbies  is)

I'm not sure that makes much sense, the newbie population is fairly small, and
this idea spreads them out more so that the odds of getting together sub 10th
level groups drops even further.  Of course noone needs a group under 10, but I
find those groups really fun; even with experienced players everyone is busy
trying to figure out the mechanics of their new class and so forth.  Plus
nowadays you can just shrug off deaths that low, which is a lesson some have a
hard time learning until they hit 65!
