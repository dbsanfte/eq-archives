Its a preseason game and the proceeds go to charity. Its quite 
different.

A preseason game is more like a beta. So then it would be more like SOE 
selling beta slots (ok, yeah, they already did that) and then its 
followed up by donating proceeds to charity (SOE must have forgotten to 
do that!).

That charity bit is important, and reduces the whole thing to a 
publicity stunt... you can't really ascribe it to greed if they give the 
money away. Although, yes, ultimately they are trying to generate 
interest in their team etc... so there are profit driven ulterior 
motives... but... they are 'healthy' profit driven ulterior motives. =)
