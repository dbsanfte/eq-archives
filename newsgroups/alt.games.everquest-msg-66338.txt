Actually people, do your research.  On Paladins of Norrath - THE site for
the best info on the Paladin class - Lvl 60 Paladins were getting resisted
on average 50% of the time.  On some mobs it was always resisted.  And while
it seemed to stop AoEs interestingly enough it didn't seem to stop a Cheal.
Plus the fact that it only lasts 6 seconds and has a long recast time means
it is not that powerful.

And for crying out loud - bringing an extra 6 Paladins on a raid with this
spell is no different to bringing an extra 6 clerics to cheal rotate, or an
extra 6 epic rogues.  Once again Verant give Paladins the thing they need to
be useful at high ends, and what does every other class cry? "NERF!"  I
mean, how about we take away a warrior's defensive disc?  How about we
increase the mana cost for Cheal?  Then perhaps some other classes might get
to feel how Paladins do.  But no, once again Paladins are the ones who
suffer.

There just seems to be this mindset with Verant and a lot of other players
that Paladins should be worthless, and the way Verant treats us we nearly
are.
