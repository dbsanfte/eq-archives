No, we were talking about a specific issue, slavery.  The push
for civil rights came from churches as a direct result of
various tenets of the faith:  "we're all God's children," etc.
The push back against that wasn't based on faith, but on social
issues.  As one who attended church during the period, I can
well remember the difference in the preaching...

And you give an example of women's rights, while ignoring the
role of organized religion in women's suffrage...
