what are any clicky/worn mana regen items?
And what is the easiest to get?

Clicky breeze or clarity would be ok, but anything works. A mana regen
debuff or such is Ok too. Aggro is not an issue, as I am trying to
design the most self-sufficient necro I can. Aggro is not an issue in
fear kiting, and bonus in aggro kiting.
Other situations are adjusted as applicable, of course.
