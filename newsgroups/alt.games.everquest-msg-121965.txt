i have a war almost 54 now and i have spent countless hours in kael trying
to get some plate armor to drop.  i know that it drops around the arena and
i know i used to see quite a bit drop at the bank off the Lts.  i got all my
druids at the bank, but since i took my warrior there i havent seen one
thing drop.  is it just my bad luck or is there some trick to it, or is
there someplace better i can go with just one grp of mid 50s to camp it.
any help is appreciated, thanks
