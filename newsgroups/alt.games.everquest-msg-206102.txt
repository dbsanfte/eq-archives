No, i'm not kidding but I might not have been expressive enough. I've
never seen anyone asking for Bh'li as an ATK buff during a raid. The
only time people want it is for SoW when travelling. And they will
always ask for FoE before they ask a shaman for Bh'li.

Not that many raid targets are outdoors though, which I guess makes the
entire argument academic.
