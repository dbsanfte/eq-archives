The quick heals are *extremely* inefficient compared to CH.

An OOM cleric without epic is pretty much useless.  An OOM cleric without an
epic with a horse in an outdoor zone won't be OOM for long.

Not particularly.  Druids aren't "efficient" healers, particularly for
healing masses of people.  Druids can operate in a CH chain quite well,
though.  It might be better to put the 60 cleric on casting (using /tgb on)
ethereal elixir (I have the spell memorized on my pocket cleric all the
time, and I'm not totally sure that's its name...  the group duration heal). 
That will suck a cleric dry pretty fast, but it shouldn't be a terribly long
fight.  With more AAs (which someone might have), MGB'ing celestial regen
can be very effective for keeping masses healed through light damage (druids
with MGB and spirit of wood work as well, and actually stack with celestial
regen).

You call a CH, a CH better be cast.  The entire point of a CH chain is to
keep the heals coming at a predictable rate.  Remembering my earlier days of
raiding (before channels, when I actually saw this stuff), sometimes the
cleric leading the CH chain would call for adjustments, speeding up or
slowing down the chain as needed.

In my guild, some call them, most don't.  You can tell if a spam heal (what
we call it in my guild) lands or not by whether the tank needs a rez or is
still fighting.  =)
