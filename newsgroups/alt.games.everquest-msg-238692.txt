Yes -- as long as you also have earned that many points in Butcher.

Put another way: if you earn 100 points each in Butcher, Everfrost,
Guk and Takish, you can buy four 100-point items in Everfrost, but
you can't buy a 400-point item in Everfrost.

As far as I am aware, all LDoN-purchased charms work equally well in any
LDoN theme dungeon.
