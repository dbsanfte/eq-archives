Most EQ players do not spend much time soloing.

I agree that few play in the high end raiding game either.

The vast majority of players are in the 30 to 50 range, don't raid much 
at all (if ever), but also don't solo much (if ever)

They tend to congregate in groups of 2 to 6, used to be 3 more often 
than not, but within the past year a massive boost to group exp bonus 
has lead to a great deal more full groups.

I've yet to see a single move that disenfranchised soloing players, 
though; yes, there have been more rewards added to make grouping better, 
but thats not the same thing as damaging soloers, its no harder to solo 
a druid, necro, bard or enchanter now than it was 4 years ago, easier, 
actually, since there are lots and lots more zones, so your odds of 
finding decent mobs soloable at your level and class and skill that 
Aren't already taken by other soloer's are a lot higher than they used 
to be.

Mind you, I don't have GOD, so I can't speak to that, but I'll admit 
that LDoN has little to offer a soloer at the moment.  But that doesn't 
damage a solo player, who merely has to not bother buying that 
expansion; LDoN didn't take any abilities away or any mobs away or 
hunting areas away... unless perhaps its that Everfrost now tends to be 
devastated by bored people waiting to get an LDoN running.

Splendid
