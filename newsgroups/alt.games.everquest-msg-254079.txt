They suck for that.  I don't think there's a tradeskill where the price of 
components to raise skill to 21 (the cap for spending skill points) is 
measured in more than gp.  Well, tailoring, you have to farm.  But you'll 
need those threads and silks anyway. :)

They are good, in quantity, for three things:  Research, which is just way 
too much of a pain in the butt any other way, Poisonmaking, which is 
somehow exempt from the aforementioned cap, and learning the first points 
of rare languages, like orcish.  Oh, they can also be useful for tweaking 
your specialization skills, if you're a caster.

As a melee, though, I'd probably drop them all in my least-used weapons 
skill, generally 2HB.
