Wait for daylight.  I always waited until 7 AM game time (type /time) and
got out of the zone befor 6 PM.  The potent vendor in RV has 3 charge Locate
Corpse Rods for sale (6 to 8pp I believe)  He is in a hut near the Fools
Gold.  The rod looks like a grey flashlight with a purple lens cover.  Get
in the zone where your corpse is, target yourself, right click on the rod.
It will turn you so that you are facing in the direction of your corpse.
Walk on a stright line and you will find your corpse.  I always keep one of
these rods on me and one in the bank.  They are less effective in dungeons
since you cant walk in a stright line - but even in a dungeon they can be a
big help.
