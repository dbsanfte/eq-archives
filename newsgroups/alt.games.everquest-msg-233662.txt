Oh no, original EQ theme, were doomed to listen to the same music again.

On a lighter note, what does everyone think of the new PS2 Champions of
Norrath coming soon, I've spent maybe 25 hrs. on BG2 for X-Box and find it
entertaining but it seems almost over, will getting a PS2 be worth it for
just one game, why didn't they release this for the other consoles namely
X-Box, do they just like to shoot themself's in the foot for profit margins
or is it just plain nonsence pride.

I welcome your comments all good or bad but be gentle :) lol
