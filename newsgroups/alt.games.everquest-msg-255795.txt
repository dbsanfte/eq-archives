The big difference for LDoN gear is typically it has 3 augment slots, 
and, once well augmented, it is comparable to elemental gear, certainly 
better than ornate.  Now GoD gear OTOH, is just sick in comparison.  I 
only have one piece, a 135hp bracer.  That's more hp than any other 
single piece of gear I own, not to mention, probably the 3rd highest ac 
of the gear I own, behind my ornate bp, and LDoN leggings.  Oh, and the 
bracer has two effects on it too, one to give me melee crits (oooh, 
aaaah), and one to increase the damage of cold based DD spells.

LDoN gear is below elemental bosses, time, and GoD, not sure it's below 
much else.

Single group doable drops from GoD are better than LDoN.  I know, I have 
one such drop.

For the best weapons, you do have to raid, although some fully augmented 
LDoN weapons are pretty nice.
