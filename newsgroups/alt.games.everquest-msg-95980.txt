...but only because of price and availability.  Then again, if you buy 768
or a gig now, by the time you want to upgrade again you won't care...it'll
be your kid's computer.  Rambus (aka RIMM, RDRAM) are still sold on
brand-new Dell 8200s so I'm thinking Kingston and others are yelling "I'm
not dead yet!" in their worst British accent.  Dell's the biggest seller of
pre-made systems, and the 8200s are what you would buy for your home
(4300/4400s only have a couple expansion slots).  Rambus runs at 800MHz
which is a hell of a lot faster than anything else out there, but may be
more than you need, or care about.  Pricing certainly isn't pleasant; at
pricewatch the first name-brand (Samsung...I've never bought this brand)
start at $156+S&H and Kingston starts at $219+S&H (going down, was $237 a
week or two ago).

Type of memory is, of course, dependent upon the motherboard you buy.
