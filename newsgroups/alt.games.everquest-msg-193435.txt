In reply,

I run a p4 2.4 with 1gb ram and a 128 ti-4200 geforce 4.  I seem to get all
the bells and wistles with the exception of the bazaar.  and my zonetimes
are about 5-10 seconds depending.  Here is my system price sheet also

Processor (P4 2.40 gHz 533 FSB): $188.00
Motherboard (Soyo p4x400 Dragon Ultra): $120.00
Ram (2 x 512 mb DDR 2700) : $150.00
Hard Drive (2 x Maxtor 60 gig): $200.00
Video Card (ABIT GeForce 4 TI-4200) : $120.00
Case (Generic) : $60.00

Total System Price : $838.00

Factors that I have found affect performance :

Memory and video card affects visual lag performance.  Processor speed and
internet affect zoning times and zone lag.  Memory for DDR systems is cheap
these days as now i can get a 512 chip 2700 for only 60 bucks.  Great
website to check for parts is www.pricewatch.com.  Here i found the
processor and video card cheap.  Everything else i ordered from
www.outpost.com (Fry's Electronics).  BTW the motherboard also has onboard
raid (SCSI access times if u set it up as striping).  for $120 you could not
beat that deal.
