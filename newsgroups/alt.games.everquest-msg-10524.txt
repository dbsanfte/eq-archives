I personally do it like this. If I get there, and someone is fighting
3 mobs, regardless if he's taken a swing at all of them or not, I go
on my merry way. If I see that same person fighting 2 mobs, and a 3rd
is running toward him to join the fray, I'll nab the 3rd and fight it.
It's obviously not a part of the original pull. If the 3rd gets to the
guy before I can engage it fully (ie my spell is still being cast, or
a single hit doesn't pull it), so what. I'm taking it, anyway. I've
never had anyone complain yet.
