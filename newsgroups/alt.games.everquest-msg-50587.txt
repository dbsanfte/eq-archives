I'll take a crack at this one.  For tradeskills, you should have a look
at www.eqtraders.com.  The next/easiest step is to get to level 51 in
blacksmithing, and you do this by making toolboxes.  Check out the recipes
section on that site for the ingredients you need.  Making toolboxes is
about the cheapest way to get to 51.  After that, it gets more expensive because
you need molds.... you make skewers to level 115.   At that point, you can
make banded armor, I think.

Note that you should buy as much Int or Wis gear as you can (as is appropriate
for the type of spell caster you are using) as having a high Int or Wis
will accelerate your skill ups.  +2 Int rings are fairly cheap, around 4p
each.  I imagine +2 wis rings are about the same price.

Also, strength helps in skill-ups too, but to a lesser degree.
