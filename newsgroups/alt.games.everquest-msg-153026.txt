Problem is, that would disencourage someone from helping out a guildie in
the same class.  After all, why would I help another paladin on the Vox raid
if it means I'm ruining my chance to get her scale?  Or, even if I'm the
only one who needs her, what if she doesn't drop what I need?  Now I've got
to wait another month.

Only if it's in the room with the mob, or within a small range.  After all,
it would be a shame to be ported from SolB just because you raided there
last week.  Whatever group you're with probably wouldn't appriciate the
sudden port (or death of a group member).

Unfortunately, that wouldn't just slow things down, that would make things
even worse than now.  Instead of just a wipe if you fail the raid, now you
won't even be able to try it again for another two weeks.  Only the uberest
guilds would be able to safely take on a raid.

You know, there are other reasons to be in the zone beisdes raiding?

It may be more realistic, but it also would put the brakes on alot of
smaller guilds.  Larger ones can swap around members when it's time for a
raid.  For my guild, however, what we have is what we have.
