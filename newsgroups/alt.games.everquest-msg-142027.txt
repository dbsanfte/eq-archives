Ok, the Kael phase has passed.  I'll only be going there with my guild I
guess or if I get a few more lvl's under my belt.  I do have a question
about shaman shields and weapons tho.

I currently have a Howling Harpoon in my primary and my epic shield in my
secondary, I'm looking for some upgrades.  Not really the weapon as much as
the shield, it blows.  I'm looking for a few suggestions if anybody has any.
I don't care if it's a quest, drop or something that I can find in the
bazaar.  I have access to a well rounded, almost full group of lvl 47-51
characters if needed.

Thanks again in advance.
