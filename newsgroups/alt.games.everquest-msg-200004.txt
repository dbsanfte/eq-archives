Heh, that one is EASY to forget. We did the same once, although we knew 
that we needed a rogue, noone really thought about it before we got to 
the door and got stuck. Luckily we got a mage with us to CoH one down.

With the group setup you mention, the chanter better be REALLY good, 

since theres some REALLY nasty rooms you kinda have to charge in to to 
get to the king, the room after the pit trap spring to mind, even a 
quite large force can get in serious trouble there if you dont have a 
few GOOD chanters with you.

But look on the brigth side, king is 2 hour spawn time, so not a 
contested mob, can do it almost whenever you wanna do it. :)


Oh, and a good tip about the chardok raid:
Do NOT use pets when going past the pit trap. True, pets SHOULDNT create 
aggro, but we got 2 wipes there that had no other explanations, noone 
fell down, noone got any aggro, but king + his room came and ate us. 
Next time we tried with pet classes killing their pets before crossing 
that room, and we never had the problem again). Cant be 100% sure that 
was the reason, but all evidence pointed that way, and better to be safe 
than sorry, can summon them again in next room.
