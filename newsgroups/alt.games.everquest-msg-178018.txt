I told you it was a timesink dungeon after the annoying timesink quest to
get there !

Bloodbath, its a rogue weapon from the High Priest in Ssra.  Has a +BS mod,
and an ATK effect, very nice weapon.. and from what I can tell, pretty rare.

Hmm...  im assuming you CoH'd to the first goo.   Its the only place you can
really CoH to at the start of a clearing (other so called safe spots have
warder issues).. hes the only rooted goo I can think of too.

Why did you pull "surrounding mobs"?  More to the point, *what* surrounding
mobs?!

Hes perma rooted, and his room has NO other mobs in it.

Behind him is a doorway and this does indeed have mobs behind it, but the
door is nowhere near the mob, and I can't understand why you would clear
ahead of the named, and then come back for the named..?

You know the areas where you can go 4 ways? (one of the walls is a dead end
though)
 A really wide open room, but the paths in each direction are quite narrow..
where you saw the spinning sword.   Those places are the lava areas.
