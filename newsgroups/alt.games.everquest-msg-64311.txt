  Oops, I misread your earlier post.  I dunno, doing it by server would
probably overly complicate the process a bit.  What I wish they would have
done is allow us to download the patch while the servers were down.  If they
were still tweaking certain files while the servers were down, they could've
let us download those files that WERE done.  If they had to overwrite some
of them later, no big deal.  It at least would've distributed the load a bit
more over a longer span of time.

  Afterall, this is the way every previous patch I've ever experienced was
done, and the actual downloading of the patches has always gone relatively
well.
