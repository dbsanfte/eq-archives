Heh... Actually I have a little first-hand experience on managing 
asynchronous file loads and deloads, and even in the best possible 
circumstances, it's a pain in the arse. Most single-player games use 
zoning (even if, like Half Life or GTAIII, they manage to make them 
almost invisible); in a MMORPG the situation is worse, as you have to 
deal with a much larger global file (the textures and models that need 
to be available all the time, in case a player happens to pop right 
there).

What you suggest is the way I imagine most flight sims to work, and it 
could work (Hell, I suppose it *does* work) for something like Asheron's 
Call, but I doubt it could deal with something like moving from GFay to 
Felwithe, for example.

Not to mention... how would your data structure deal with gating, evacs, 
or CoH? Of course, you always design the game around the limitations of 
the engine, but my point is that streaming is not necessarily the 
obvious decision - settling for a zoning system is a perfectly 
legitimate design choice that doesn't indicate either laziness or 
incompetence.
