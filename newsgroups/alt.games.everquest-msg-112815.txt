Well, they went back and said they weren't going to make some of these 
changes. But all they said that wasn't going to change was the 1 char 
limit. So what they still plan on changing is anybodies guess.

I think it was www.eqlive.com where there was some official 
announcements about it.

Although sometimes the restrictions on FV can be a royal pain in the 
ass, I think the restrictions have made for a great server IMHO. Of 
course, I guess its all what your looking for in game play though.

I'm a 45 druid, and I can train in every language possible. I think that 
as you get higher in level, you'll see more languages. Human seems to 
pretty much be the standard, but no one expects anyone under level 20 to 
speak it to well unless they are human.

45 Druid Wood Elf. Alignment is pretty much neutral, and so far it seems 
I can group with just about anyone.
