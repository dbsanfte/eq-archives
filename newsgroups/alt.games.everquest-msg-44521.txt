I'm currently hunting in DL. The exp is very good there, but the drops are a
bit mediocre. Until I started selling my gems instead of giving them to our
guild enchanter/jeweler. Standard nights now give me about 1 yellow per hour
and roughly 100pp. Last night in about 4 hours of playing I got 80pp, 300gp,
1 emerald, 2 black pearls, 2 opals and lots of words and runes; plus 3.5
yellows of exp. All that while having 1 total party wipe-out and 2
linkdeaths (which normally takes me down to OOM because of recasting pet +
buffs + no med time while the rest was fighting (I was the mana supplier
with modrods)).
