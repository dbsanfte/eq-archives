Hmm negative impacts.

How about the negative impact of people dying in horrible pain because
doctors are just not willing to prescribe good painkillers near the end of
life, forms in triplicate and questions that are just better avoided. Ok so
he died in pain but i didnt get the gestapo calling on me.

How about the one drug user who knocked over 13 conveinence stores and shot
someone because he needed the 8000 dollars for the 2 bucks worth of
chemicals. How about the little girl that gets shot by accident when drug
turf wars are in her neighberhood.

How about the law officers who find it damn conveinent to get little susie
the pot smoker to say whatever they want her to in court because she is just
NOT going to go to jail for 15 years. How about the seizure laws that allow
officers to seize property of others not in any way conected to any crime.

Dying is always expensive, thankfully it happens to each of us just once.
The cost is pretty much the same no matter what part of life you do it in.
Young or old that last 6 monthes of a bad lingering condition is gonna cost
a fortune.
