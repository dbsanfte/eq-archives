I'm sure growing pubic hair is a natural progression and not in anyway
caused by reading this NG.
Believe me Biz, you act anything but mature.

I was trying to point out that to troll here or start flame wars cannot be
done without participation of others, one or two posters can't really do it
on their own. DT and others have said that they enjoy the flame wars and DT
even had one about his right to bait trolls. So, although they have
disrupted this NG I remember seeing other posts that were, in my mind, not
intended as flame bait but were jumped on just as hard, difference beeing
the poster either left, deciding this obviously wasn't a place to get any
information or apologised for his own opinions, whether they were right or
wrong.
You on the other hand jump in feet first then decide it's futile (you didn't
see that to start with?) and give a dramatic post of PLONK, why? why not
just k/f someone and be done with it or better yet, don't post to them, you
recognise all their posts by your own admission so it should be easy to spot
the ones not to post to do you think it bothers them? They're not really
here for any reason than to wind everyone up and it seems everyone else
takes pleasure in this, not saying that's wrong if that's what you like, so
be it, no ones ever forced me to read a thread.

The only person who shows any frustration is you, Biz. You're the one that
is getting wound up, Dan, DT and the rest seem to be having a laugh, the FA
guys certainly are, Stanmann and Lokari don't really seem that perturbed and
join in every now and again. You are the one who isn't dealing with it, not
anyone else.

To stop the inevitable "trying to tell us how to post" reply, I am not but
eveytime your name appears in the a thread you can almost here the
collective cheer from the FA crew. You've made such a point of KF'ing these
people that joining in to thread they have started must be such a bonus for
them.
Oh and I didn't actually expect you to read it as I was certain I was KF'd,
feel free to add a PLONK in reply if you so wish.
