I'm hoping that they'll develop EQ2 instead. Then  when
everybody shifts over I can retire my account and get my life back.

I'm sure Verant will keep developing new expansions for as long as
people keep paying for them. Most people seem to have upgraded
with each new expansion, so with 200000 (?) users, each new
expansion earns, what, $2M in one hit? Assuming a $10 profit
per box. Plus, probably, a small number of new users with
corresponding subscriber fees.

I voted for fixing old content. The other way to read their poll
question is "can we leave things broken as long as we give you
new toys, or do we reeeeally have to fix your old toys first?"
