?  after the mage gets his defense maxed for a level, having him
tank is worthless.  Fire pet has an innate DS that is miles ahead
of anything the mage can cast on himself.  With cleric buffs and
a full load of summoned armor/focus items the fire pet easily tanks
xp mobs, vastly better than a robe wearing finger waggler.  Rooting 
the mob is also a waste of mana, useful for adds mostly, unless the mage
or cleric gets carried away nuking.  Healing a pet generates *no*
aggro, I've had my bot cleric sitting under the feet of a sun rev
in between Complete heals on my mage's pet without being hit.  As
much as possible you want dps coming from the DS and Pet, as those
are easily sustained.
