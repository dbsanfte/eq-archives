I don't get your point?

How does that level the playing field? The *only* leadership skills
that a multi-boxer would benefit from is regen and the +health,
+mana... all of which are largely considered 'irrelevant'.

The worthwhile leadership abilities are the ones that facilitate and
speed up communication between multiple players, mark npc, show npc
health, delegate mark npc, inspect buffs, even find path to PC etc ...
what is the point of preventing groups of 2 from making use of these
abilities? How does not being allowed to mark an NPC when I'm just
duoing with my brother 'level the playing field'??

You seem to suggest that 2 boxers shouldn't earn leadership from 2
boxing... I agree with that. But that has nothing to do with whether
or not those leadship abilities, once earned, should be active in
smaller groups. I'd be happy if you could only earn leadership in 5
person groups... but I'd still argue that once those leadership
abilities are earned you can use them in much smaller groups, even 2
people.
