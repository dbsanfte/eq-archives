*sigh* Just goes to show there are too many badly played rangers out
there. True, we can't take a beating like a warrior but if played well
(i.e.: know how to control your aggro) we don't have to. 

 If the ranger in your group is sucking up all the healer's mana then
you need to sit 'em down and discuss their tactics. Are they
snaring/rooting/flame-licking like there's no tomorrow? Dual-wielding
low delay weapons? Mashing the taunt hotkey like they wanna be a
martyr? Have a hero complex? All of the above? A well played ranger is
a sight to behold. A badly played one just furthers the notion that
"rangers suck".

It comes down to the person playing the ranger, not the class itself.
This is true of EVERY class in EQ. I've grouped with rogues who wanted
to be heroes (talk about a mana sink), druids who thought they were
wizards, etc, etc.
