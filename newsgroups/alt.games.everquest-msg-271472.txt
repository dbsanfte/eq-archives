I don't know what you possibly could have downloaded for legends but OoW
is another expansion. And the only one you are missing right now. But as
OoW starts with lvl50+ I'd say you can do fine without it. At least for
a while. To use it you have to buy a key to register it with your
account. So no, the files you've downloaded just sit around on your
HD. :)
