Dark Ages of Camelot is pretty interesting. Although I don't care for 
PvP, DAoC's RvR (realm vs. realm) is actually pretty fun. I have been 
part of some very large scale battles that got my blood pumping. Since 
the release of Shrouded Isles there is some descent raid content, but 
nothing outstanding compared to EQ. I havent played DAoC in over 6 
months, so alot may have changed.

Good luck in your search.
