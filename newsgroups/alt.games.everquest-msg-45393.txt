Hello,

My name is Mike Kron, and I am a freshman here at RIT.  I am posting this to
see if any other RIT EQ players would like to form a group of our own in
which we could control the play times with fun, balanced classes and
interesting places to hunt/quest.

Since I'm sure we all play on different servers, it would probably mean
coming together and playing on a server we're not normally used to playing
on.  I'm not asking anyone to give up their beloved primaries on other
servers, but I just wanted to see if people would be interested in doing
this as perhaps a weekly or bi-weekly thing.  I am well aware that an
organized group of people with similar playing times can do a LOT more in an
LOT less time than people with no communication in different time zones.
Plus it would just be a fun and social thing to do.

My EQ history:
I'm an ex-evercrack addict.  I define evercrack as playing Everquest in a
manner that wastes a lot of time accomplishing nothing while staying
addicted.  ie:  "/ooc looking for a seb group" for hours.  I used to play a
lvl 55 ranger and lvl 40 shadowknight on Tunare, been all over most of the
original zones.  I have been to *most* zones in Kunark, and a few in
Vellious.  I love the game, but playing long hours waiting for things to
happen with people I'll never meet just got old.  That's why I'd be ecstatic
if anyone would be interseted in playing this way.

For all I know, an RIT EQ group might already exists, but I hadn't seen
anything of yet so I thought I'd post this.  If one DOES already exist, I'd
like to learn more about it if possible.  If one DOES NOT exist, would
anyone out there care to join me in creating this?  Drop me an email if
you'd like to try this out.  Thanks much for any feedback!

Mike Kron, CS freshman
