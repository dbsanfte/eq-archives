Actually, you're not going far enough back - when EQ released and
REQUIRED a 3d card, many pundits predicted its doom based on this fact.

I actually don't have a problem with the hardware requirements of
EQ2, if you gain a benefit commeasurate with the expenditure you lay
out. - I just don't think you get enough return on your investment in
the hardware.  I bought my original Pure 3d, Voodoo 1 card just to
play EQ.  $150 in '99 dollars for a gaming experience unlike any other
available at the time was well worth it.

In order to be able to play with a decent amount of options turned on,
I'd need to invest about $600+ in my machine(*).  I've seen EQ2's 
graphics at those option levels - they aren't worth $600 dollars

(*) that's mimimum and doesn't do enough to really be viable for
a decent amount of time.  I'd probably go to $1000 and build an
entirely new machine. (excepting peripherals).

Part of that is that my GF and I are saving to buy a place (so no big
expenditures) but I'm not sure that, even with more money at my
disposal, that I would shell out just for EQ2 -- and I only have time
for 1 game at a time, so it would be only for EQ2.

Actually, are you sure modern hardware can't do better than EQ2 does
with it?  I'd be willing to bet that, in the right hands, it can.
 
A huge part of that is my distrust in SOE's programmer's ability to 
write a decent graphics engine.  Based on their performance on the
original eq engine, umbra and the DX9 engine - they simply don't know
how to write a decent engine.

You talk about Luclin, talk about the biggest GFX fiasco short of the
DX9 debacle - most of the models were uglier, performance on a decent
machine took a MASSIVE hit to have them on.  I kept all turned off until
they made me have to use them to use a mount.  Human proportions were 
way off, animations were incredibly ugly.

Once again I can't help but feel that SOE's programmers don't use that
hardware very well, that in different hands a graphics engine designed
to an N-Force4 SLI board with the top end AMD chip (55?) and 2 PCI-e8 
6800 (gt's that the top now?) with 2GB of ram and a fast raid-0 setup
would produce stunning graphics.

But I doubt that EQ2 would actually stun me on that machine - even
with all the options on the movies I've seen don't knock me over, and
they should.
