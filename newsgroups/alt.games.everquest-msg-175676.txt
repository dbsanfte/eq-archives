No difference except the weight and cost.

Th combine instruments in Katta are better than the regular store bought 
variety. They have a higher percentage modifier than their standard 
counterparts. I'm sure someone could give you the percentages, but 
suffice it to say, for their cost, they are pretty good. When you can 
afford it, I would purchase the drum and lute. Here again, the mandolin 
is no better except for being slightly lighter.

As far as what the combine means, I would assume it is as the other 
combine items in the game, and is from the Combine Empire.

Yes, it is like Harmony, but it is a single target only. If there are 
more than one to lull, you will need to "Lament" each MOB. Make sure you 
use your instrument for that one, it will help with resists.
