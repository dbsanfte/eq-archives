This would require a seperate entry into the already Brobdingnagian item 
database for each signed item.  You can easily see that the item database 
would quickly inflate to unmanageable proportions, and worse, be different 
for every server.

The suggestion I sent in was that tradeskill-crafted items became nodrop 
after being traded.  That idea suffers the same problem.

perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
