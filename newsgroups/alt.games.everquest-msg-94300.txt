I guess I just figured everyone at least glanced at the MOTD...  Silly me
:o)  Personally, I cannot avoid reading it..  LOL  My eyes are drawn to the
yellow text each and every time I log on.  Sad really...  LOL

Well, your ticket taking example is a prime example indeed.  I have one as
well...  LOL  I live in the UP of Michigan and we had a very mild start to
our winter this past year.  Deer Hunting season is in November and we not
only had no snow, we had temps in the 60's and 70's.  Guys were having to
buy ice by the bagfulls to stuff inside the carcasses of the deer to keep
them fresh til they could get them checked in at DNR and then to the
Butcher.  ANYWAY...  LOL  Every business in our area that sells ice of
course ran out of ice within a day of opening the season.  I personally made
a BIG sign, hung it on the door to my business that said, "OUT OF ICE-We are
out of ice until Monday"  I know I don't have to tell you how many people
would still come in the door, up to counter and ask for ice.  Sad really....
