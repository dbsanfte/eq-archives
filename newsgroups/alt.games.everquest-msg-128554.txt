Sorry bub, but you must not have looked at the bar in a while, even off a
level 57 mob at level 53 (solo), the most exp you get is under half a blue.

Yes, and you can get even more than that in one kill in any dungeon at 35 by
killing something of equivalent level.

Need warrior for HT sucking, yes, but nearly any melee with good +hp
gear/buffs works just as well.  At that level, Cleric's don't have CH yet,
so you'd do just as well with a shaman or druid really.

Congratulations, you just described why no one kills them for exp, you die
too fast without a meat magnet for the HT, and even then you still die if
you pull more than 1, maybe 2.  (BTW, their HT is only in the 320-360 range)

Besides, everyone knows that Kedge exp > all.
