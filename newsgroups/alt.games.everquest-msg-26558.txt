Darktide is an all-PvP server, but on the "normal" Asheron's Call servers
you can undergo a quest which will turn you from white to PK-red. Reds can
attack each other at will (no /duel necessary) but they can neither harm nor
be harmed by whites. I much prefer EQ's non-PvP servers' consent-based
duelling system; it keeps high-level griefers from slaughtering all the
lowbies.
