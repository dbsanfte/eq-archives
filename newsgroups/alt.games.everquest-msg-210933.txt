I could have sworn there was an upper limit to the mob level that will 
give additional xp to someone, like five levels over your level or 
somesuch.  Basically means you get the same amount of xp for killing a 
level 14 mob when you are level 9 as you would for killing a level 60 
mob.  Not sure what that limit is off hand though.
