Oops...hit send...D'oh

To continue my drivel;

I think this is the reason people have complemented me on my CC, not because
I am any good with my Enchanter, in truth as a solo character I prolly suck,
but because I know exactly what is happening for all the characters in
question I do a decent job.

So, anyway what I was trying to say is that, although there is little to
playing a Warrior you can still be without the skills (communication or
otherwise) to do so...At least I feel I am.
