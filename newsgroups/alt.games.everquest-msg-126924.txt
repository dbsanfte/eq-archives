I regularly cast Flash of Light, Root, and Stun, all level 5 and under spells,
that have no more trouble sticking to mobs than any other spells I have
in my book.

Similarly my druid (level 34) regularly uses his level 1 snare... cost 15 mana
and does pretty much the same job as the "good" one, plus his cheap
focus I items give him better range on it while the "good" one would
require focus II.

There are certain spell lines which work or stick much better in
thier higher level versions, ones I'm familiar with are Fear and Cure
Poison, both of which apparantly get more and more checks
for success as you get higher level versions, and work if any one
of the checks succedes, or add up successes tearing off an effect,
and need to tear down effects by removing several layers.  Strangely,
other spells can get -worse- with level, for example cleric stuns...
lowest level stun does no damage, so the mob saves only against stun.
Higher level stuns, though, do stun plus DD... and thats two resist
checks and if either is resisted there is no effect at  all.
