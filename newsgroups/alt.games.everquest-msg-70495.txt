Is there a site out there that lists a "Where to buy" for Ranger spells?
This probably sounds silly, but I can't recall if I'll be able to buy my lvl
30 Ranger spells in Surefall...  My character isn't really in a spot where
she can run there and check atm either...  I know there is a Ranger Trainer
in FV, so if there are lvl 30 spells there, I'll get them before I port back
to Antonica just to put them in the bank.  I'm not real close to FV atm
either and was hoping not to have to run there to check, so if ya'll have
any links to a sight that lists the spell vendors, I'd really appreciate it!

Thanks in advance,
