    Unless the cleric has to be ressed back somewhere, that is. But yeah, in
general a cleric with this ability would have never lost XP. Especially if
it's coded to ungrey after a death like other abilities. THAT could cause
abuse - if time wasn't an issue, you could duel a GM res cleric out, have a
second cleric Revive/epic them back, and get an unlimited stream of GM-level
resses.

    I don't know of any cleric who has the ability - is it coded to ungrey
after death? If it wasn't, then I could see a four hour timer.
