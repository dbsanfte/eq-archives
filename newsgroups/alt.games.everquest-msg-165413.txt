Actually, I think the upgrading quests like the rings, shawls, and Qeynos
badges (or even Firey Defender, after all... each of the pieces, from the
Brilliant Sword of Faith and Ghoulbane to the Soulfire, FA, and then FD were
_at_least_ excellent weapons in their time) are easily Verant's single best
idea.  The intermediate rewards make it worth doing at whatever level you
can, while not making it seem like one big long trudge.  I would like to see
EQ2's questing system put more emphasis on that.
