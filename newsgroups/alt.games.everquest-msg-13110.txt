Hi,

I had a strange experience with my lvl 9 necro in nektulos forrest,
some lvl 60 charachter casted dead man floating on me and i was
of finding suitable targets, when i passed the bridge moving towards
EC i was attacked by a pirhana for 18 points of damage, and when i
turned back i was killed by one over the bridge, i was floating some
10 feet (roughly) above the bridge and still got killed, i petitioned
about it but they said basically tough shit, i hate it because i loose
experience, and i consider this a BUG, walking across the bridge 
seems to be without problems, but maybe the pirhanas can fly
like the killer shark that floats ontop the boat when going from
qeynos -> erudin *lol*

Has this happened to any one else??

/Regards Berth aka Thotamon
