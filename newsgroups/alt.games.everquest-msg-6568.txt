No.

They do not stack.  Although I personally used ED when I first got it, I now
use CD almost exclusively- it uses one third the mana, seems to have similar
resistance, and has the same slowing effect (granted for a shorter time).
When fighting things that resist darkness 4 times out of 5, you really
appreciate he mana savings.  And in groups, if a snare fails (or you don't
have one), CD casts much quicker and you can usually get it off in emergency
situations.  I don't use darkness for the damage anymore.
Personal preference...

> 3) Do you still use Disease cloud?
I'm a higher level and that gets replaced by Heart Flutter (a great spell!)
but until I got that, I still used DC every time.  Low mana cost, a good
taunter, and reduces monster healing...

Not that I know of.

I tend to let him...

I honestly didn't know it was available in Freeport, as a previous poster
said- and I dont have the expansion, so I never
got the spell.  I'll definetely check it out now.

Personally, I avoided evocation.  I don't think the mana cost was worth it-
I found lifetap to be just as useful.
Higher undead spells might be worth it, however.  At my level I have Expulse
Undead, which I believe is like 90damage for 60 mana, if I'm not mistaken.
Not bad, but the damage dealt isn't much different from a typical weapon
round- is the 60 mana worth it?  Or spend a similar amount of mana, deal 45
damage, and gain 45 health?  Again, personal preference.  The argument can
be made that the former is better since the monster will die that mich
quicker, and you will save health in the long run.

PS-  wait till you get the level 30 line of spells.  It's a whole new
ballgame then.
