   Yeah, that is a bit of problem.  Personally, I would just prefer that
anyone who feels compelled to respond to your infantile drivel on this
newsgroup would just bite their tongue, and go ahead and KF you
instead.  It would so cut down on the noise/info ratio.  Flaming you
certainly won't, since you seem to thrive on it.

    I guess it's better that you work through your griefing impulses
here, rather than in game.  At least, when I knew you when I played on
Drinal, you seemed to be a good enough sort.  It's been a while of
course, but I do remember grouping with you once or twice, and certainly
have chatted with you upon occasion.  You may even have been on my
friends list (my Drinals have been dormant for quite a while, so really
don't remember).  I'm also pretty sure I remember you as having an good
rep, or at least, not one so bad that I remember it as so. 

/shrug I don't really care what you say here, or why.  I don't have
ANYONE on killfile, and it is still easy not to get drug into flame
wars.  I just wish that the more combative members of this community
would stop taking the bait you set out, and sooner or later you might
get tired of ranting to  yourself.
