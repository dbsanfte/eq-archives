NO ! Bad suggestion. Install the latest firmware and you'll be lucky
if you can play for more than 30 minutes without a disconnect. Tihs
has been posted several times so you might go back and double check
the archives, but I think it is something like 1.40.1 you need to back
up to....I'm relying on memory here, so don't trust it, look it up.
If you don't find it or no one else post, I'll look it up.
