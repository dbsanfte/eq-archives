Thank you.

I believe the conclusion/premise of 2a (The
Creator must have been created) to be faulty.

These are not the only possibilities though, are
they?

I don't see how you have concluded that at all. Am
I missing the pea again? 

If a creator has always existed, if there has
never been any other state, apart from a creator
being present, how does that fit in with your
either/or scenario?

Which of your premises does that eventuality fall
under?

As someone else said here, (at least, I think it
was here), Occam's Razor is only a rule of thumb
for quickly evaluating which hypotheses are likely
to be fruitful; it is not a strict rule, nor an
inevitable aspect of the scientific method.

Demolish is a bit strong. Poked at it with a
stick, perhaps.

I agree.

I wasn't supporting dogma as a viable alternative
to scientific method.

Ease of assumption is not a very good test of
veracity, but I don't disagree.

As I pointed out above, I believe one of the
premises is faulty, and if so, the entire argument
falls.

Yes.

What do you mean by 'essentially meaningless', how
would this be different from just 'meaningless'?

It might be simpler to proceed as if He does not
exist, but what exactly is the benefit of
simplicity in this case? 

>has been said of Him is no more than white noise, and you cannot base
>any actions on any of it.

You can base your actions on it, and millions
(billions?) do.

(Warning; bad analogy approaching)
If you tried to explain gravity to a stone-age
tribe, they would have to invent a whole new
vocabulary to explain the sudden onslaught of
concepts they would be forced to face. This
doesn't mean that they should ignore it, neither
does it mean they cannot base any of their actions
on it. 

It does mean, however, that they do not have the
terms to explain it.

(That would be 'our chain', wouldn't it?)

Why should this be an either/or proposition?

I'd rather have had a bite from the fruit of the

I haven't heard this line of thought before. Did
you formulate this? 

If you didn't, do you know of a website where it
is discussed in more detail?
