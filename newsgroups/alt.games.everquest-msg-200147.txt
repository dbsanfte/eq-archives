Here is a link to Allakhazam:

Officially, the quest is for levels 35+, although I'm not sure how hard the
Grimling Runner is to take down at level 35.  I don't know about how your
faction as a DE will effect you, but I'm guessing that you'll be dubious at
best to the various folks in Katta and maybe KoS.  I would suggest that you
go to Katta (invis!), find a safe place to drop invis and con the guards
from a distance.
