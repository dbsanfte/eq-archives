Ok, I had the same problem with EQ and WinMe. I did an upgrade from win98 to
WinMe and Eq was like crap. I did a fresh WinMe install from scratch and EQ
worked fine.
So if you did an upgrade, the problem with EQ might be here. In fact, I
think the operating system should never be upgraded. I always do fresh
install now...
