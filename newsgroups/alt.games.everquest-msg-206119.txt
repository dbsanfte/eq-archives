I have about had it with this game. I played for about 1/2 hour tonight and
locked up 3 times. Logged on with my other computer and crashed instantly!
The first machine is a Athlon 2000xp+ with a ATI 9500 Redeon pro, Abit
mother board w\512 mg ddr and a soundblaster 16pci sound card. Second
machine is a 900 mhz Tbird, 384 mg pc133, Gforce2 GTS and on board sound.
does anyone have any idea how to make them NOT crassh to desktop?

Brent
