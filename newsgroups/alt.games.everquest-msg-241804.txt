Well, this whole discussion you got into centers around the
question "If mage pets were upgraded, why weren't <insert class>
pets upgraded."  Forgetting for a moment that only 1 mage pet was
had its innate mitigation increased - and it's the level 65 rune
spell which summoned a pet that mitigated far worse than the level
61 Ethereal spell did.

The big thing that happened was that pet foci got additional
functionality added to them.  So, the question "If <bl, nec,
mag> pets got mitigation increases why didn't <enc, sha, sk,
dru> pets get it?" is easily answered - they aren't primary
pet classes as evidenced by the fact that they are not now and
have never been able to use the DPoC, GoDS, SoAS etc, and the
fact that they have never been called a primary pet class.
