Its under combat abilities, and you should be able to make a button
out of it. Then just drag it over to your hot keys. It never goes up
as a shaman and always does like one damage, but its fun to use
because eventually you are stunning things (especially if they are low
level to you) My 30 shaman always delighted using it on the orcs in
west commons when they tried to run.


>2) What weapon proficiency is best to work on: 1HB, 2HB, 1HS, 2HS?

Pierce and 1 hb as a shaman. Your epic is pierce as well as some now
pretty cheap (1 k or under) piercers like the jade chokadai prod which
is 30 spd 11 dam 3 sta and 6 wis. 2h blunt might be good too. Shamans
can't train slashing weapons, so no go there (nor can they equip any
as far as i know, either way its moot)
