What? 
You don't spend all your time in full groups of strangers or guild
raids of 120 members?
You have time in the constant power pulling to ACTUALLY eat?

You must be really strange....

Oh wait, maybe not everyone wants to power to 65, or wants to spend 32
hours on line waiting for an epic mob to spawn.

MAYBE some people actually play the game, rather than beating the
game.

It could be that Verant selling an expansion on the strength of one
group, doing a dungeon on their own, with no interuptions might just
appeal to us strange, incomprehensible "casual" players.

And just maybe, when there are two people together, the game calls
that a group, might lead some people to believe that when the
expansion is described as "for groups", that the definition of what a
group is would not be different.
