Really? What does it mean to be able to wear plate but not be on the plate
defense table? What's the point? Except for impressing the women? :)

Yes I guess I need a horse. Although these days I spend a lot of time

FV is a lot less crowded than most servers I think so its harder to get

The bank we could do with one group but the Arena is tough.

I'd like Donal's breastplate :)

Got a lot of compliments for that all-silver look.

Thanks for the tips!
