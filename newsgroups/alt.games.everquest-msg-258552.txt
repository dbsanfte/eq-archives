I carry around a bottle of DS potions, but as with any charged item, I 
always think twice before using them.

The duration is so short, and when they are gone they are gone, its much 
like any  item with charges, I get so uptight about conserving the 
resource that it ends up not doing me any good.

I carry around a bottle of gate potions, I've used it twice; once just 
to see how it worked, once when my chanter friend challenged me to a 
race to POK... I ran around a corner, knowing she was just going to 
stand around for a minute or two taunting me and then gate, and swigged 
potion.  300pp worth of funny?  Yep, but funny once.

Mana regen would do me no good, stun potions, heck, I'm a stun machine, 
Levitation I should pick up if just for following bards around..

SOW on the other hand, I have two ten shots on me and five more ten 
shots in the bank.  I drink them constantly, I drink them on the way to 
a camp where I know there's a SOW caster waiting.  At 10pp a sip, with 
decent duration, I don't think about the expense; I've still not touched 
TBoot price, and I'm faster than TBoot!  Course soon I'll get run 3 and 
then never bother with the things again.

Is ther a HP regen potion line?  Does it stack with cast Fungal 
Regrowth, or is superior to it (15 hp a tic buff)?  I might consider 
that, if the duration is good.

Stat potions, I'd also consider; strength (better than spirit strength) 
Stamina, Dex, base HP... but the duration would have to be very long, 
because the actual effect of boosting these even up to my cap of 255 
isn't all that much, its just an incremental improvement.

How about buff Haste?  I won't have self cast buff haste till 55, and if 
its better than 30% I'd still consider potion haste.  Haste has a very 
noticable effect on fights, far more than any stat boost.

Even more interesting would be overhaste; there's only one class that 
can provide overhaste at the moment, and this wouldn't be slitting your 
own throat since it would stack with your cast haste; sort of like the 
way shaman DS potions stack on top of bard -and- mage/druid DS

I'm not aware by a long shot of everything that's potentially out there, 
but I am influenced by three problems that, to me, plague potions; high 
prices, short durations, and marginal effects.
