The adolescent-mentality folks will always do whatever they think they
can get away with.

I place the blame for the name problem with Verant - not because they
made this rule - I think it's a good rule, with good reasoning behind
it - but because they have very weak enforcement policies.

Some time ago Brad stated that the naming policy would be more
strongly enforced. That seemed to last a few days, then *poof*.

To the specific point of Prexus, we have one guide (Aberlin?) who has
been accused of being a Name Nazi. I'm not sure how this could be the
case, since of course as a guide she can't do anything about a name
violator, except escalate to the GMs.

Personally, I wish a system was in place where a Guide *could* change
a name - sadly, there is too much potential for abuse in allowing
that, so it'll never happen.
