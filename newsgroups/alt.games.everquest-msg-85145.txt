Firstly im not uber, never claimed to be and never will be.  Just look at
the logic though.. 10 tanks (aka warriors, *not* damage dealers) when you
already have a big MA and SA to tank it.. thats nutso.  Replace 10 un-needed
tanks with 5 damage dealers, and watch him drop at least twice as fast.

When I first did Fayducky, it was not with a big or "uber" guild, we were
pretty much a small-medium sized guild (in terms of achievements, our
numbers were very low)
