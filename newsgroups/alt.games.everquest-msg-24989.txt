Yes, that's been discussed. If we are to move up, we may have to up the
minimum level. But it's also met with a lot of resistance from folks who
want to keep it a more "family oriented" kind of guild and not shut out
the people who are at the level *we* were when we got a break and got
invited into a guild. I have to confess, I'd feel pretty guilty about
that as well. They took my previous main at only level 20 and I'd feel
pretty much like a snob telling a good player and potential friend,
"Sorry.. you're only a level 35 n00b. You can't join."
