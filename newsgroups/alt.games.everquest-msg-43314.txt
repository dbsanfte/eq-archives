"Don't Crush that Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers", perhaps Firesign Theatres best
album (and out of circulation for over a decade), is being re-issued on CD in
November.

In other news, "Bride of Firesign" is out but I'm not recommending it to anyone
other than those fireheads that have a deep knowledge of the FST catalogue as
it is almost all FST in-jokes.  I don't think that the casual FST fan or new
listener would appreciate it.  That said, I thought it was quite funny.  Look
for the return of Porgie and Mudhead, Nick, Rocky, Lt. Bradshaw, Radio Now, and
more.

Meanwhile, the FST recorded a special for PBS that will be broadcast this
December.  Look for "Weirdly Cool" on the TV schedule.  I saw the taping and it
was a great show.
