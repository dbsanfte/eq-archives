on a side note, playing all the way through Serious Sam is a good
way to learn mouselook skills.  i was a keyboard-only player until
i played that game.

when i started up the game, i thought the default keyboard configuration
was insane.  "why are the left and right arrows mapped to strafe?
they should clearly be used for turning!"  but by the time i finished
the game, most if not all the keys were back to their original
settings.
