Bah, us wizards keep getting shafted.  Look at it from OUR Point of view :
Our BEST moneymaker.........TL's and ports........get taken from us by PoP.
Our Mana burn.......what EVERY wiz was workin for.........gets nerfed so
it's practically useless............then right after, they make the mages
pets stronger, and improve their nukes.  WTF!!  I saw a mage nuke for as
much as I do, he was 1 level higher, but I have the white dragonscale
cloak.......and still nuke for more DD than WIZARDS 4 levels higher; and
ummmm the wizards are SUPPOSED to have the better nukes BECAUSE we don't get
a pet.  figure that one out.  lol
