Off topic.. I remember one of the 'zoneless' games had some zone 
issues... mobs could be pulled to the zone edge and would stop and run 
along it instead of follow you across... I forget if it was DAoC or AC

SWG had planets. Within the planet, zoning was seemless unless you 
returned to cloning center or took a shuttle. It would load and unload 
assets dynamically. The problem was that you would, say walk into a city 
newbie zone from outside, see nothing, then get attacked by a dozen 
angry agro bandits (which were really no threat at high level) as the 
materialize right on top of you. Non static assets could also pop on top 
of you... I've had a pc placed imp fort just appear 10 feet away from 
me... alas I was reb at the time, and they had a covert detector

most of the really wonky stuff like that happened when you ran around on 
speeders... you could jet along watching red dots appear behind you on 
radar... like a wake on a boat

On the two 'civilized' moons, it worked great, because few people went 
there... no lag, no problems. Everywhere else though... it was annoying 
to say the least.

I remember trying to place a harvester for 45 seconds, unable to get a 
green spot, then a field of houses materialize around me.

You didn't ask but:
Guildwars uses a big instanced zones system.
Final Fantasy uses a EQ style zone system, but they do a very good job 
of "oooh what's that over there..." "It's the Great Star Tree that grows 
over Heaven's tower in Windhurst" "We're 2 zones from Windhurst" "That's 
why it's the 'Great' Star Tree". Of course, they had to work within the 
memory confines of the PS2 when they designed it.
