Camp the Ancient Cyclops in South Ro and kill a LOT of spiders.
It's not really important to actually GET the AC, just the spiders :)

Then go for Raw Silk, later for Cured Silk, then for Quivers
(Quiver Pattern and hq cat pelt, trivials at 115)

Oh and - yes, Jewelcraft IS needed for the Coldain Prayer Shawls.
But don't worry, only cost me 2.7kpp to get JC up to 170.
Shouldn't be an issue if you manage to kill the Ancient Cyclops
while farming spiders, you can multiquest the ring for 5 to 7 kpp,
at least that's what I did (for a cheap 4kpp, though).

PS: I _know_ what pain in the ass tailoring is, just didn't think you
    have to tell that to people right away, huh? :)
