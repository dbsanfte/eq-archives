Ive just started a new SK and I was wondering what would be some good
armor and weapons for him. I was thinking of using the golden bastard
sword to start with as I can make it with my main toon but not sure
about anything else. I have 10k to spend but Im on Stromm where
everything costs twice as much as other servers.
