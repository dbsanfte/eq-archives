Have you ever actually owned a cat and shown it affection rather than
treating it as a pest like most non-cat people do, using the fact the
cat doesn't kiss their asses anyway as "proof" that dogs are more
loyal?

Dogs aren't loyal, they're stupid. Abuse a dog, and it'll hang around.
Abuse a cat, and it'll leave first chance it gets. They're "loyal"
because they don't know better.
