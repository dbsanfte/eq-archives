But I don't think that's the right comparison to use because when rational 
people are doing dangerous things, they are usually paying attention. You 
don't die from using the forge if you're paying attention. Like I said, I've 
never died once from this accidentally. The analogy to consider is the case 
where someone is doing something inherently dangerous (like forging molten 
metal) while trying to watch TV or chat with someone and generally not 
paying attention. That's the only situation in which you're at risk.
