I don't come on here to bitch and moan about people or even bitch about
Verant for that matter....Mostly I reply to questions people have if I have
something new to add  to the post that I feel will help them. And I do get
kicks from reading some of the flame posts...

BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD !

Thunder_princes please, for the sakes of all women on this newsgroup and all
women on Eq....STFU already....just by responding to half of these idiotic
posts with your obvious 12 year old girl intellect,  you make yourself and
other women look like asses. God knows I personally don't want you known as
a defender for the rights of Eq women or myself especially. I also tend to
think you likely have been booted off of most message boards for your lack
of creativity and intelligent input. So NOW... you infest this newsgroup
with your babbling bs.

See the point here in case you're missing it is this. They post something
stupid...you respond with something that an amoeba could have thought
of...further reducing the level of intellect here....they reply to you with
something brainless so that you can understand it. Do ya get it now hun?

Also FYI Thunder_Princes:

a�moe�ba also a�me�ba (-mb).
n., pl. a�moe�bas or a�moe�bae (-b).

A protozoan of the genus Amoeba or related genera, occurring in water and
soil and as a >>>parasite<<< in other animals. An amoeba has no definite
form and consists essentially of a mass of protoplasm containing one nucleus
or more surrounded by a delicate, flexible outer membrane. It moves by means
of pseudopods.


The one question to you that I do ask is this....can you chew bubblegum and
walk at the same time? (old joke yes, but serves the purpose here)

Do us all a favor....pick ONE topic to reply to per week...take that entire
week to think up a REALLY good reply, then post it.

Thanking you in advance...
An annoyed female Eq player
