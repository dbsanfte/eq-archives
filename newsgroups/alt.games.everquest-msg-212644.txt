Oh we do.  We always enjoy death when you're half way through writing 'guys
this thing's hitting really hard' or 'hey never seen one of those before'.

The metallic slime in PoI ate 4/6ths of our party before I even had time to
say 'ooh never seen one of these'.

Recently got chain summoned by the Croc part of the BST Epic, now that was
funny, like being stuck in a run-lag-loop but every time I reset I lost
1/6th of my health :)  [I really expected Tarzan to leap in and take that
croc on, rolling and rolling with his little knife held between his teeth
...]
