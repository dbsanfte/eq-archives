Yeah, this doesn't make a lot of sense.  I can get all my resists to about 
110 unbuffed, but with buffs and bard song, I'm over 255 on all, and can 
hit 360+ on MR.  I've got BD in ears, fingers, wrists, neck, and face, 
plus a resist off-hander and range item, and still can't get to 170 
unbuffed.  I'm about 1/2 in Kael quest armor, and have generally decent 
gear for anyone not in a true uberguild.
