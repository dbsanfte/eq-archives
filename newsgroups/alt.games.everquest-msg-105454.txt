At which point you became defensive and lashed out at anyone who

That is not my opinion.

You don't understand the mentality of the detracters, then (who are
much less numerous now anyways). Simply implying that EQ can be hacked
in the way you implied is a victory for them.

In the end, its still pretty idiotic or at best unrealistically
cynical to assume EQ was *hacked* because you couldn't get to Sony's
site, even for someone used to battle.net. Its natural to assume
someone is not being idiotic, rather they have 'other' motives.

We saw three possibilities: you were an idiot, you were a troll, or
you were a newbie. You clarified yourself into a newbie later.

A better way to put it is "Why is EQ down?"
