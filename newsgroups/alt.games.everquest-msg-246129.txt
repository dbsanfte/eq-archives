Actually, I believe that is incorrect  and based on the way they said they
had to adjust class xp penalties,  your actual xp needed for level is
determined by your class/race combo.  They said repeatedly they just
couldn't remove the penalties, as that would change the actual levels of
certain characters. They had to do this cludgy 'we multiply the xp you
recieve by your xp penalty' BS to get it to neutralize.

I base this on several comments by SoE, as well as an observation:
It was observed, when class penalties were in effect, that adding say a
troll shadowknight to your group slowed your group xp rate more than a
similarly effective class of less significant xp penaltiees, say a halfling
warrior. This was because the XP split to the group was determined not by
the ratio of levels, but the ratio of experience earned. Having earned
upwards of 20%-40% more xp, hybrids sucked a larger chunk of xp from the
group. Having grouped regularly with a shadowknight-ranger-ranger before the
xp changes, this does appear to have been the case. (man my xp was sloooow
in that group)

Also, iirc the original work with ShowEQ showed data in the form of actual
xp numbers being passed to the client to update the xp bar when things were
killed. Your troll SK didn't get less xp per kill than the halfling warrior,
based on what was being sent to the client. For a level 1 creature, both got
the same xp (also iirc, the formula was L*L*100*ZEM per kill)
They had to estimate the modifiers based on the amount of xp they earned
before a level up. I remember reading about taking Erudite's as the base,
then realizing all erudites classes had an xp penalty. I think they set
wood/high elves as 1.0 to get a good class selection. Then once they got the
curves for several classes, they were able to deduce the formula for the
'base' XP, and come up with exact racial and class based penalties.
The formula for a level's xp is something like:
L*L*L*1000*Cl*Rc*Y
where L= current level, Cl = class pealty, Rc= Race penalty, and Y= a
sliding constant based on level range, which was responsible for the 'hell
levels'
At level one a human monk needed: 1*1*1*1000*1*1*1=1000 xp
At level one a Troll SK needed: 1*1*1*1000*1.25*1.15*1=1437.5 xp
So based on their numbers, it didn't modify the xp received, it modified the
xp needed.  you still got 100*ZEM xp per newbie mob... you just needed to
get more xp to get to level 2.
Now, the troll recieve more xp (due to 'shifting out' the xp penatly for
Shadowknight) per kill, therefore levels a little faster. He still needs
more kills than the Human monk does.

Of course the server now sends the bar information as a percentage filled,
so these numbers can't be reverified.
