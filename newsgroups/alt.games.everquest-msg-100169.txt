You cut my post on going to another zone.  The main point is that The
Druid does the fighting and the bard just gives mana back to the
druid.   There are many zones out there that will be much safer than
CS. 

Also he does not have to Quad. He can just root dot anything and the
bard will get exp if it is blue or higher.
