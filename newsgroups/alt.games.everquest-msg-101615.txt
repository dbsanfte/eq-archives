Hello group.

I play a 52 Ogre Warrior, who hopefully will help slay Lord Nagafen
tomorrow.

This is the first time ever I will attend such a raid, so I quickly gave my
enchanter a mission to make some resist gear.

So far, this is what she has come up with:

Apart from a pair of Velium BD bracers (working on those), could you please
give me some advice what good MR/FR items to look for, or other good raid
equipment.

Also, as a 52 ogre warrior, maybe I will be the main tank, if so, what is
the strategy for MT's, should I go with higher AC instead of resist gear as
Naggy will aim his melee hits on me?


Thankful for all advice I can get!
/D
