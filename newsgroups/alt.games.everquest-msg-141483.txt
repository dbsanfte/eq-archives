*IF* the player was doing the same scam I've seen before, he may have
just had 25 to 29 other items that he was charging too much for but
wanted to move. He would then put one highly desirable item at a *very*
discounted price way down in the bottom with more over priced items in
front of it. This is to find a motivated buyer with deep pockets who
might come along and start vendor "trash diving" buying up all of his
overpriced items to get to the desired one. Depending how he acquired
the desirable item in the first place, (i.e. if he looted it, it's no
big deal anyway) it might still be a huge profit making scheme.

If he's a REAL sleezebag, he could be tagged as "AFK" but be sitting at
keyboard watching the mule. When the motivate buyer comes along and buys
up all of his dozen or two shit items, he could then it "end trader"
before the buyer could get to the desired cheap deal, then camp out.
