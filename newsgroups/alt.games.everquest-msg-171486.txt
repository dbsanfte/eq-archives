A bard that used to be in my guild kited next door, in Skyfire.  I don't
think he charmed, I think he quadded.  Or maybe fear-kited.  Or maybe some
of both.

Very few things there summon, and the casting isn't horrible.  Chromodracs
boil your blood but then turn around and debuff it off of you. Drakes toss
some fire damage at you but nothing you can't laugh off.
