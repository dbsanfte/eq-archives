Hello all.
Just an FYI...
Over the last few days I'd been having difficulties logging on as my
main character (Tzen) at certain times.  When I did manage to log in,
I started getting tells from level 10's saying "Hey bro, are you ready
to hunt more orcs in EC?".  Now I havent hunted orcs in EC (with Tzen)
for around a year, so I said "erm, no you must have gotten me confused
with someone else".  But this guy said it was yesterday.  I also get
/tells from friends saying a guy with my name was on the server, but
wasn't me.  Pretty strong evidence, to say the least, of something
strange going on.

Same thing happened last night, (couldnt log in) so I immediately
logged in as my monk alt, and did a /who Tzen all, and lo and behold,
there he was.  I sent him a /tell, explaining the situation, and he
was pretty decent about it.  The other Tzen was level 10 and fairly
recently created, and he had noticed problems logging on at certain
times too  (when I was logged on hehe).  I told him I would /petition
to get a name change (preferably his!).  Like I said, he was fairly
cool about it, and we had a good chat, while I was waiting for a GM to
sort it out.  A guide contacted me fairly quickly, but had to defer
the issue to a GM.

As it turned out it was level, rather than age of the character, that
was the deciding factor in who would change name, but as I was 46
(hehe dinged 47 an hour later!) and he was 10 it was him who had to
change.  At the end of the day, no major harm done, and (as far as I
gathered) no hard feelings from the other guy.

So what is my point?
Just this:  If you seem to have problems logging in as a character
(you get disconnected straight away as soon as you click on its name
from the char selection screen, log in as or create an alt, when do a
/who all on the character you were trying to log in as.  You might get
a suprise to see a doppelganger (well namewise anyway) playing.

I know the server is meant to reject duplicate names (as well as
"dodgy" ones) but the GM on the 7th Hammer told me the filter on it
was "buggy" (her exact word).  I assume this could apply to all
servers, as they should all have the same code base (apart from the
PVP and RP servers).

Regards,

Tzen, 47 Ranger, (and not 10 Necro!), The Seventh Hammer.
