Thats precisely my point.  Unless I still don't get it.  But to show that
you'll have to give me a longer description of the difference between
what I said and what you said.

Pick a card, any card.  Wow, 3 of spades.  Cause I made you
pick that card.

Pick an option, any option.  Wow, you picked the one without
the lame-ass shadows.

Yep yep.

If you look at my earlier post, I went a little deeper.  While
the shadows are a force, the poll itself is like an election between
Bush and Gore, two options noone in the electorate really wanted
to see win.

Fix stuff and stop making new content?  No thanks.
Make new content and stop fixing stuff?  No thanks.

Neither option is what we want.  We want "fix stuff moderately
slowly and continue to issue new content, also slowly" rather
than "drop one aspect and rush the other"

This is (for reasons I've long since forgotten) known as the
Hobson's Choice approach.

Also known as "Have you stopped beating your wife?"
