Server status has been screwed up since they took out server populations.
now a server returns 0 (down), -1 (up but locked) or 1 (up)
used to be a server would return 0 (down), -1 (up but locked) or # of
players, and most pages that followed that
reported <10 users as something along the lines of 'Up but not connecting'

I have an app that shows the server status on my guild page, unfortunately
it shows exactly what is on their server page (not much use).

Also, since the login server has been removed from the chat server, but not
given it's own id in the server status list, you can't even see what it's
status is.

Finally, they broke the chat banner reporting too... :P
