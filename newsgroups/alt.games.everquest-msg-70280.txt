Whilst I agree with the idea here, I still have one problem with Verant
"fixing" the Fungi tunic, or any other twink.  Whether Faned laid down plat
for it, or quested for it, he got it under the assumption that it had
certain characteristics.  When Verant nerfed it, they reduced the value of
the item without compensation.  Sure, it may be "only a game," but if you're
going to have that as your criteria for whether to comment or complain about
something, then you may as well not communicate in any way about anything
because "surely there are more important things going on in the world." ...
I'm rambling....

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
