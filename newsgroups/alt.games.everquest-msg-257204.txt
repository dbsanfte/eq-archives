Being a halfling, I saw it as my duty to try and climb the spire of the
town hall in Rivervale. (Done with only a lev, by the way)
Here's me being a tree on top of said pinnacle.

From there it's possible to lev to just about anywhere in the zone,
including the outer wall that runs round the back of the druid guild,
where there's a great spot for hiding out.

I did the same in the POK, the spire on the building that's connected
by the easternmost bridge. The top of the library is the holy grail of
guerilla ascent, but sadly the little lip running all the way round *just*
foils my plans every time.

It has been done by exploiting a collision bug on the wall, which
stuck someone just enough to survive.
