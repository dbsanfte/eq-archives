No. That would be equally annoying, if not more so, and also spelled out
in the previously referenced documents as being "in poor taste". Tell
me, if you want to answer any particular portion of a post, and ensure
that somebody joining the thread late or getting it out of order might
know what you're talking about, is it really *that* draining of anyone's
precious time to leave in the most relavent portion of the previous
post, then add your comments below so it reads like a conversation,
debate, etc.?  
  Equally annoying would be wiping out all the text entirely and then
posting a vexing *response* to text no longer in the message.

Out of curiousity, are you folks who rail against this really not
understanding the benefit of judicious snipping and bottom posting, or
just arguing this for the sake of saying something different?
