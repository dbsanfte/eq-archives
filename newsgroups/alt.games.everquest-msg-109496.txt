Well, that wasn't exactly my understanding. Verant got ticked off when a
guild used components of the terrain *that Verant created* (if you are
thinking of the same incident I am, a bridge, IIRC) to their advantage
and in a way Verant's designers hadn't been smart enough to anticipate.
Verant *does* seem to consider than an exploit; but personally, I think
that's a load of horse shit. An exploit, to me anyway, suggests you have
hacked or cracked the game engine itself to allow you to do something
you would not normally be able to do. Using a bridge to avoid AOEs and
summoning for the casters doesn't sound like an exploit to me; it sounds
like someone came up with an effective *tactic*. Banning people or
guilds for using their noggins and what Verant has given them to work
with is pretty sleezy behavior on Verant's part IMO.
