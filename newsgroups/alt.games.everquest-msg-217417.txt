Happened to us last night, in City of Mist, where we were going for
my Jade Reaver for my epic. We had 2 groups at the wall, we'd
pulled everything on our way in, the puller had hit his "-a Black Reaver-
is INCOMING!!!" hotkey, when someone noticed they couldnt buff
their pet. "HALT PULL!!!" Thank god for pullers with FD :)
