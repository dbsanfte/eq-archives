No, it isn't.  It's most commonly used for a woman that the user
thinks doesn't have a pleasant attitude.  She doesn't have to be
powerful or scheming, just disliked.  

>Ever heard the terms "super bitch" or "queen bitch"?  When the super

Almost never, actually.  They aren't especially common terms.  "Super"
or "Queen" do of course imply power.  "Bitch" alone doesn't.  And when
you say "my bitch" that's a statement that you are their master and
they are analogous to your dog.
