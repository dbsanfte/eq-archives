Awesome! I saved all this great faction info to a text file. Thank you 
so much for posting it all. I am tempted to play a Dark Elf Cleric after 
things I have been reading about this.

I'm still going a little crazy trying to make up my mind on race but at 
least at this point I've learned that stats really aren't much of an 
issue. It's more about the race I'd most like playing, looking at and 
their starting area.

I'm tossing around the ideas of Dark Elf, High Elf, Dwarf and Halfling 
now. Decisions, decisions...

You guys are great though. I really enjoy reading your take on the 
different races one can play. :-)
