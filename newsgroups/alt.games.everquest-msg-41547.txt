She is supposedly in the Qeynos catacombs but I haven't been able to find
her.  I found one of the posse that was looking for her and he mentions a
secret door and being overwhelmed by necros and undead.  So I figure evil
guys guild area.  But she's not there.  So I bring druid and she doesn't
show up on tracking.  Any ideas?
