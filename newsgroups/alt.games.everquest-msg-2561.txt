Well, simple put the answer to the original question is no.
Doesn't matter if SK/Paladins get the same Defensive cap as Warriors.
They can give the SK/Paladins the exact same hitpoints and the exact
same armor with the same AC, it still won't make a difference.  Unless
SK/Paladins get Warrior disciplines, Warriors are essential in high
level raids.
