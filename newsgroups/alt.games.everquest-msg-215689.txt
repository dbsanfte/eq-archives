I say Ensnare, by the way, rather than Snare, because getting four mobs
all snared up at the same time in your kill area can be time consuming,
as can rounding them into a cluster and even the nuking them to death
part tends to be slower than straight single target nuking because the
quad nukes do less damage per shot.

Often you -can- kill all the mobs on just the duration of Snare, but
Ensnare doesn't cost much more, and if Snare wears off on some of your
mobs but not others (after all, its not an AE snare, so it will wear off
this way) then you have to resnare and then put the mobs back in their
cluster, by which point the next mob is having his snare wear off.
Someone suggested resnaring all the mobs once you have them formed up,
that works of course, but its time consuming and mana consuming and
confusing, since often all four mobs have the same name, figuring out
which have been snared and which haven't can be problematic.

For Wizards, the process is similar, but they have an AE snare, so once
clustered they can easily resnare, plus they have no option for a long
duration snare, so they are forced to make do without it.  Gather,
cluster, resnare, start killing, consider resnaring again if its taking
a long time, thats the wizard version of this.
