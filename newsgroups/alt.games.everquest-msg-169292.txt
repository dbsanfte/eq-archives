Well, while stage professionals pile more rouge on than anyone else, 
let's not inquire about race in this. Some folks prefer to hunt rouge in 
specialty shops, others in department stores, and nowadays even the 
internet. If I bother, I hunt mine down in drug stores cause it's 
cheaper there and I rarely use it. The roll of rouge is to define ones 
cheekbones and give the illusion of a healthy glow.

Oh you mean rogue.

I've seen a lot of cat, barbarian and dwarven rogues, but really play 
whatever you like best. You want to focus on STA when picking your 
stats, but DEX and STR are important too. Hunting grounds depends on 
level, but you want to go where you can get a group. Rogues are NOT 
soloers. Their job is to get behind the mob and backstab - they have 
awesome damage per second outlay. They are great scouts and corpse 
draggers too.

Of course my favorite rogue at the moment is a certain gnome.
