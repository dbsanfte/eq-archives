Try this one. I smoke. Have for more years than I care to admit to. I also
knew the day I took my first puff that it was stupid, dangerous, and would
probably end up killing me.

Morons suing, or even TRYING to blame big companies to assuage thier own
guilt over their own stupid fucking decisions boggles my mind to this

consequences of my own actions.
