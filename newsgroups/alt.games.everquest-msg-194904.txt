I can't comment on whether he'll deal with anyone either, but his name is
Starn Bearjumper and he's not too far from the North Tower where Mega,
Tundra Jack and Iceberg hand out.  And the north tower is one a wee way
across both arms of the ef river from ig camp.  He is at the south end of a
ruin that has a big sloping "roof" that's colored blue - the ruin is right
at the north end of ef.

On the topic of shammy spells, all your pet/charm animal spells can be
bought from a vendor in a little hut by the water in west karana.  However,
don't know whether she would trade with a dark race.
