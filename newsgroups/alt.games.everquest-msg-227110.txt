Hehe! I found out that Wizards had root the hard way the other evening. 
While having fun and getting faction and experience in Lower Guk. I was 
soloing the undead knights, I thought if I could get the Frogluks to 
like me, they might be a bit less upset when I go and ask Slaythe the 
Slayer for the other half of the bow I need.

So far I have been having a ball, I have killed a range of the old 
Undead. Then I run into a Dark Blue to me undead Wizard. He starts by 
gently cooking me with mana bolts then swaps to a fire spell for that 
golden roasted look with crackling. I decide that as my health was 
dropping faster than a souffl� if you open the oven door to early. I 
will make a tactical withdraw (With SoW that's fast)

Next thing I know is I seem to be running in thick honey (Bonds of force 
I seem to remember), followed closely by being tossed clean across the 
canal and being presented as a Honey Roasted Hobbit entr�e at the next 
undead Frogluk meal.

Needless to say I am a bit more careful on how I treat an undead Wizard. 
I am polite and let someone else deal with them <grin>
