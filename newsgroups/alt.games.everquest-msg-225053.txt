Servers usually have generally accepted message boards where they can
schedule zones for certain times and dates.  They do this so that two
groups of 50 people dont assemble and unwittingly all go after the
same thing at the same time, causing either a fight or at least a
major loss of time and effort.

Find your server's boards and find out when the next raid is
scheduled.  Morell Thule's is pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.  (If you
happen to be on this server).  I would bet that a lot or even most
servers also have their generally accepted message boards on ezboard
as well.

The raids can be fun, so go on one or a few of them.  But there is
much to be experienced past 52.  Remember that you can always start an
alt and level him to 45 or 50 for Vox and Naggy.  Use your main to see
the rest of the world.
