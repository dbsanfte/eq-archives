Moving while casting interrupts your spell casting.  If you are moving, and
then stop to cast, you'll find that you often get interrupted, even though
you are -sure- you stopped first.  The server gets this mixed up all the time.
The solution is to stop, turn in place, and -then- start casting.  Spinning
stationary
is allowed while casting, and doing this forces the fact that you have stopped
onto the server.

Moving before the spell cast is finished will still interrupt the cast.

Frequently while you are being beat on or spells are being cast on you,
you will notice that you move a little bit.  This too is enough to interrupt
the cast.

As you level up, your channelling skill will increase.  This skill gives you a
chance to retain concentration when you would normally be interrupted,
so that you -can- cast while being knocked about.  I've found with
a channelling over 200 that I can often take half a step forward while
casting (just a quick tap on the forward arrow) and manage to keep
casting, just as an experiment, but I've -never- managed to purposefully
move any real distance and retain.

What I -can- do is cast while hopelessly drunk, despite the fact that
this condition causes me to sway back and forth.  At low levels this
too will be almost impossible, but I can cast about one time in three
while so drunk I cannot possibly drink any more.  As a cleric of Brell,
I've had ample opportunity to test this out.  I've also filed a bug report,
as my critical craft skill, alcohol tolerance, refuses to move over 200!
