hehe, our GL is a monk. For a laugh, he made up a fake magelo using HIS
gear on a warrior. Only 2 pieces of his gear weren't equippable by a
warrior, so he swapped in pieces with equivalent hps. 

He said his theoretical warrior had over 6k hps...

There is no longer ANY difference in the endgame between leather/chain
and plate restrictions.

In fact, I've heard it mentioned, that if a rogue and a warrior went for
all the highest +hp items in the game, the rogue would end up with 28
more raw +hp. Heh.
