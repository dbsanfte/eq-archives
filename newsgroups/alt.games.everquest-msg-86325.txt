	It was the fact that non-consensual PvP existed in the first place that
made it a pain.

	Yeah, and I want a pony and a red wagon.  Again: that game exists already,
it is called Quake.

	Oh, let's be honest.  They couldn't put any of us in charge of one of
these servers for three months, because it would take us less than one to
either run it into the ground or quit in disgust.
