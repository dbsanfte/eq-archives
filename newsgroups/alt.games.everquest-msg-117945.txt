I accidentally emailed Graefaxe instead of posting here.  Sorry for that.
But here is what I said:

For your information Graefaxe, I do not hide under multiple names.  I face
my music.  Anyway, I don't believe in trading or buying accounts as that is
against the EULA.  I just don't think time is something that Verant can
control.
