Its also AE, which means you can hit yourself with it if you aren't 
careful... but in most LDoN there's plenty of room to avoid that, and 
you shouldn't be running anyway.  And you could hit lulled mobs with it 
and wake them up which would be bad, but thats easily solved by pulling 
the targets back, as you always have the room you just cleared to pull 
to, no repops, unless you've had to pacify ahead.  AE range on it is 
pretty small though, even in close quarters you shouldh't be fighting 
-that- close to a lulled mob.

The short duration thing is irrelevant, you won't be kiting the mobs, 
the reason they have to be snared is to prevent them running away when 
near death and finding friends.  Wait till closer to death if you have 
to.  But I think its 3 minute duration, and if you aren't killing mobs 
in two minutes at worst you are failing the mission.

Point being, DPS and snare are important jobs, and if you are good at 
them then you shouldn't be a burden on any group, but an asset.  Can't 
tell you how many wizards I've seen that don't know how to snare, necros 
who don't know how to mez, chanters who don't charm... people who only 
bring half what their class is capable of to the table; the whole class 
gets a bad rep because of it.
