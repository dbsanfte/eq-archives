There used to be one, but unlike all the other spots like this in the game,
it got "fixed" over a year ago.

Note that they didn't fix falling through the world, just the safe spot that
you fell to.

It used to be that you could hop into the river and attempt to swim across
the zone line into North Karana.  You'd fall through the world, and get
placed in the safe spot, which was that signpost rock just outside the
Qeynos Hills zone line.  It was a great shortcut, and I used it myself
dozens of times.

Now the safe spot that it drops you at is the riverbank next to the North
Karana zone.
