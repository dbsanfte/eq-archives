What is the functional difference?  In both cases, you get more xp the 
first few times until the xp bottoms out at some level (whether you call 
that the normal level i.e. bonus gone, or you call it the reduced level).  
How would you even be able to tell the difference between the two 
methods?

For example, assume a mob gives 100xp normally, and the bonus is 100xp 
for the bonus method.  First kill you get 200xp, gradually reduces after 
that down to 100xp.

Next, assume the normal xp for the mob is 200xp, and the antigrind 
reduced xp is 100xp.  First kill you get 200xp, gradually reduces after 
that down to 100xp.

In both cases, the first kill you get the same xp, and after X kills, you 
get the same reduced xp, just a question of how you want to label it and 
how it's actually implemented internally.
