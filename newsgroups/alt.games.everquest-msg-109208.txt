It may as well be, for all the people that
actually indulge in any roleplaying.

Of course not.

Just as I don't assume that everyone is in it for
roleplaying. Nor that their enjoyment is in any
way diminished by not roleplaying.

If I wasn't having fun, I wouldn't play.

This is where we disagree.

I think they are actually doing the opposite of
acting. They are doing that which comes most
naturally to them, because they no longer have the
same fear of social consequences and reprisals,
that they would be subject to, if they were not
anonymous.

Why?

It is not as if you have any equipment sensitive
enough, to detect the difference between the
presence of intelligence, and the lack of it

Believe it or not, some people will make unfounded
claims and/or give uninformed opinions.

The question "why" was put to you to see if you
knew what the fuck you were talking about.

You don't.

You merely give an opinion on the spur of the
moment, with no thought to what you are actually
saying. 

Try reading this;
"The Impact of Anonymity on Disinhibitive Behavior
Through Computer-Mediated Communication"
http://read.at/tmb/thesis.htm

Or try finding some support for your position.

Do you think people ever stop acting?

Why do think that, unless you are roleplaying, you
are an asshole?

You really cannot see the flaw in this argument?

Roleplaying is irrelevant. The vast majority of
people who play EQ and UO, do not roleplay.

Most of those that do roleplay, do not do it well.
I don't believe the games lend themselves very
well to roleplaying.

And, I'm not the only one that thinks this way.
This is what Raph Koster wrote.

Koster's Law;
"The quality of roleplaying is inversely
proportional to the number of people playing."

Simply clicking the gender button on the character
creation screen does not mean you are roleplaying.
