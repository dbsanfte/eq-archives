    Talk to your local cleric of Quellious - most of them can't even start
their Holy Symbol quests because the pieces drop off low-level mobs in The
Warrens. The quest was put in after Warrens was live - they knew about the
code, and did it anyways.

    History. That, and complexity and assumptions. There's presumably going
to be a lot of quests - likely ones will get "oopsed". They also have to
make assumptions about what level of player would benefit from the quests -
and any time they guess low, problems will result.

    For a quest to be adversely affected by Trivial Loot it HAS to be of
value to higher level players, doesn't it? ;-)

    The three INT cloak and two INT belt come to mind rather quickly.
