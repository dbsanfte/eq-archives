I had a good laugh last night in EC.  I was playing my chanter and I was
about 4am pacific so the zone was fairly dead.  Someone asked what class was
the best PvP class and a conversation started up in /ooc.  After about 5
minutes a good conversation was going with 5 or 6 people participating in
it.  Well here comes a /ooc saying "Heres and idea, why don't you create a
PvP channel and move the conversation over to it.
then another /ooc Why do you care
And now the best responce I have heard in a long time.......... "Becouse we
are using OOC atm, you mind?"
What gets me after complaining about the converstaion being in /ooc the
player started to participate in the conversation.
Now not to start a second thread, but if /ooc is not for zone chat then what
the heck is it for?
