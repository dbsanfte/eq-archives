That's exactly my point. Microsoft doesn't deliver much conceptual
innovation at the strategic level. They let someone else pioneer an area to
establish commercial viability and then they supplement with a lot of good
tactical content like dramatic usability improvements, useful and well
designed features, and then the marketing takes over. I'm not denigrating
this approach at all, indeed I respect it. They are kings in this space. But
it's not their style to deliver real innovation, and the whole Visual Studio
product is a good example. The GUI-based IDE had been around for a long time
and C++ was a pretty safe addition, don't you think? ;-)  If you want to
look at who the real pioneers there were, take a look at Lightspeed C on the
Mac, back in like 1985 or so. Now THAT was innovative and ground-breaking.
You seem to be continuing to argue the impact that Visual C++ has had and I
will continue agreeing with you and wondering why you think I disagree. No
one has had a bigger impact. But that's not the discussion.

Heh, well I think there will always be an equivalently geeky technology for
us to adopt while the soccer moms and daytona dads are getting comfortable
with our old toys. Fun just thinking about it ...
