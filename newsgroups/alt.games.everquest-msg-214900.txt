    Are you typical scared of the leaders of the groups you are in,
Malcolm?  Do you think that most groups are formed because of fear and
intimidation on the part of the party leader?  I would be more inclined
to think that if someone is lfg, they would be happy to get an invite
rather than scared.

    Maybe you are joking, but I don't see the humor, to be honest.  Why
would looking to see if anyone is on the LoY lfg tool and sending them a
tell of 'Hi, I see you're looking for a group. I'm forming one.  Wanna
join me?" be scary?  It's been my experience that if people in EQ are
overly bossy, the result is not fear, but rather irritation.  

    I'm going out on limb here and say that I would doubt if Malcolm has
had the pleasure of forming and leading many groups.
