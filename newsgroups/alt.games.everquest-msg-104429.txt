AMEN.  You got 800 druids per server walking around looking for any
group. Indoors, outdoors we don't give a shit.

I think the class is not broke but the way Verant makes the encounters
with MOBS.

ie: if the mobs would haul ass like SOC if no snare was on him.
     if you had mobs that triple hit for 20 damage but had 1000K
hitpoints and high AC, they would then want DS

As it stands there is no real reason to want a Druid.  Unless to PL
your other characters.
