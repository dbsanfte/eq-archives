300 per cast you said?  Ignoring standing mana regen for the moment, 15+2
+2+28+8+8=63.  Bard song is 21, can be boosted to what?  2x?  3x?  Let's 
say 3x for now until someone corrects me.  63+63=126 per tick.  Standing 
mana regen, I am not convinced it is more than one, but it's certainly 
low, call it 10?  That's 136 per tick.  2/3rds of 136 is about 85.  So 
that makes your 300 per cast 215.  Even with a horse and getting the 
meditate rate, I don't think you get it low enough to make it 1% of your 
mana pool, but, it does allow you to cast it continuously for quite a 
long time, no question there.  I am sure that any glaring mistakes I made 
here will be promptly corrected.
