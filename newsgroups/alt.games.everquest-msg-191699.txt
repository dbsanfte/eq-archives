I can understand this on FV server, and while I did pick my first name based
on a cartoon cat, I had to use all my wit to come up with a last name.
Considering my class was a bard, I figured 'Meowmixlot' was rather ingenious
:)  Having said that yes, it does take away from those trying to immerse
themselves in the game and for that FV is a great solution.

That may very well be, I will have to deal with that when/if the time comes.

I think the creation of FV is good for several reasons, least of all
addressing the name issue.  Even if people did pick proper fantasy type
names, the RP value in most (all) servers is non existent, for this FV is a
great idea.  As for not enforcing it, well I think only the most derogatory
of names should be dealt with in this fashion.  I mean, if you're playing EQ
in a group with your buddies and having a good old time, then suddenly some
guy named 'Lionoo Meowmixlot' runs by, did that honestly ruin your gaming
experience?
