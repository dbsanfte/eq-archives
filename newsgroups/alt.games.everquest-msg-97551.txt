If VI have screwed up and while it "takes the same amount of xp to get
to 60" it does not take the same effort, then it makes the game too easy
by directly lessening the effort that previous characters have had to
put in.

If th combination of No CRs before 10 and XP bonuses in low / mid level
dungeons totaly trivialise the chalange of 1-10 then it will be too
easy.

From what has been posted by VI I can not see anything that guarentees
that it will be too easy*

* Too easy IMHO !

There is a difference between patching bugs and game balancing and what
is in this patch (efffectivly enhancements even if hell levels were
orriginally a bug)

It will probably mean that more people stay in the game.
Some of these people may not be quite as patient as existing players.
This could make the game worse.

I think that "proof" would be imposible.
However the fact that VI have lead the players to believe that "here are
5 things that we are unlikely to ever do" and now have managed to do
them all (Hell levels, spell book, soulbind, remove CRs <10, ports via
NPCs) does indicate that they have in some ways changed their stance.
This does open the door to fear of what else they may mess with. 
Also the fact that most of these changes make the game "easier" seems to
point the direction that the game is going. This leads some people to
fear that it will be out on the playstation next year.

I agree no harm done so far, but it *is* usefull for us to debate what
could be, if only in the hope that someone at VI listens to us and
realises how it should be.
I think we should all stop shouting "Woe" and pulling our hair out
however.
