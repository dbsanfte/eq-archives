YES!

Multiple reasons:

The Porting around (just walk up, and click the book near most (but not all)
cities, click the labled tombstones once in PoK.
Spell buying - most spells are available in PoK - no more running around the
world for them
Quests: There are a couple of quests that you should be interested in. A few
more doable at 35 or so. Then a bunch around 50 or so.
Raids: You're going to see more and more raid leaders *requiring* PoP. Even
for those that don't, you're going to see them putting PoP enabled people
into a pop raid groups, and everyone else into that other "non-pop group".
The non-PoP group will get very little xp if any (the raid will always do
the most damage), and essentially no loot if the RL isn't very careful about
making sure they get some.

Now, all that said, I'm still pretty miffed at SOE for making the raid
feature PoP only - I know why they did (spare me the recitations on it
please), but it still miffs me. It's a basic game feature, not a content
feature. Should have just been a regular improvement to the game.
