Well, when the MA (Ogre Warrior) pulled seven, including four casters,
one of which is an Enchanter that immediately mezzed our Enchanter, I
think he had a pretty good idea that he was gonna be facing the three
melee mobs without healing help for a while, lol.  But ok, I'll grant
you that was a bit extreme.

Sometimes it's an advantage to be able only to protect yourself.  I've
died quite a few times after using Lay Hands on somebody else.

Fine, let them take Bergh's suggestion and double the number of zones
with serious undead mobs in them (and don't forget that most named
undead aren't undead for purposes of game mechanics), and then after
I get that ability we can discuss its value.

Well, I prefer to play a Paladin, but it sure would be cool to be able
to pull.  I do like the haste, it's total crap compared to what the
Enchanters (or even Shaman) get (it's 300 mana and self-only), but it
sure beats a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, especially when you're
fighting solo.  But, to repeat myself, I prefer working with a Warrior
to replacing one, it just seems to work out better.  Life might be
different when you're L60.23 (or whatever) and raiding NToV for goodies
in between AA grind sessions, I dunno, that's not where I'm at in the
game.
