I've never accused someone of ks'ing unless under these circumstances I had
described.  If the thing is chasing me and it's taken I *might* take it
back.  Like I had said, mistakes happen and there're plenty of mobs in DL.
It was the fact that he kept doing it, then was crass enough to accuse me of
it after taking the damned thing back after I had enough of it.  And if I
was going to accuse someone, it sure as Hell wouldn't be in /ooc.  I only
switched when he decided to voice his opinion in that way.
