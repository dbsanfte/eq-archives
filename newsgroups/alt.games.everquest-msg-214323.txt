Speaking of factions....

I went to my class GuildMaster the other day and he had this to say..(conned
dubious in Ak'anon and felwithe everyone else in the city the one below ally
or ally)

"I cannot abide you or your actions against all that is right.. BE GONE!"
Lucky for me im a chanter and used factions spells on him  and he was fine
then.

Anyone shed some insight onto this? I can't remember doing anything naughty
:)
