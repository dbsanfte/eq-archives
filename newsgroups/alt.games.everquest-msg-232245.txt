Cool stuff... I was an animator myself, and I'm more at home with the 
Disney style than with Manga, but I think those are some pretty nice 
character designs. Would love to see more when your site is up to date.

I used to have some (strictly non-naughty) fan art in my own site, but 
then I started getting pretty wary of copyright issues and removed it 
all.
