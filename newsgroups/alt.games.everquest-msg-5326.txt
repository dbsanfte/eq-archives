They were only briefly in the game. One day a few buildings showed up in
Qeynos hills and just outside of the walls of Qeynos city with people called
"rude individual"s. A couple of weeks past and they became "loathsome"...Now
thier dwellings are empty. Seems though that when they dissappeared, Qeynos
catacombs was then infested with spectres and necromancers and some funky
rats that I can't remember thier name(they were all blue to me at 45)...
That's all I know, hope it helps.
