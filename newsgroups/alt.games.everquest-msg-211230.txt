Hear hear damn straight

Get tired of both sides to this "issue" and getting really tired of
the poor abused gay guy stereo type.

Heres a news flash !
We dont care who you get it on with.  Now stop acting like cattle and
give up the victim crap. People have a bloody right to say what they
want about you just like you have the right to say what you think. All
within the limits of law of course. If the gay community continues to
play this political game of "I need special status for protection"
they may get it, and may god pity them then. Remember how that
"special status" can turn against you oh so easily. Pink Triangle
anyone?
