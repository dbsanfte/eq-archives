This will be an uphill battle.  Basically what you'll have to do is show
that alt.games.everquest is being overwhelmed with EQ2 posts.  And it isn't;
it's a small subsection so far.

Right now, a.g.e can handle both EQ and EQ2 just fine.  And my gut feeling
is that EQ2 won't have nearly the popularity that EQ does.

Someone a while ago tried to create an alt.games.everquest.sullon-zek
newgroup and got stomped on, hard, by the powers-that-be.  Right now,
without the traffic to justify it, I see a request for a.g.eq2 being treated
the same way.
