I usually run my Beastlord through Griegs End.  Most often the 'entry
loop' on the DSP zone side.  Totally under-used zone in Luclin that
actually drops plat.  Fair number of named that drop stuff that can be
sold in the bazaar for decent price as well.  Easily solo'd by a 65
beast.  I'm sure with some thought and judicious use of root for CC, a
wizard could solo it too.
