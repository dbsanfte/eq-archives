As long as you are speaking of seperate weapons, yes.  When you
consider multiple procs on a single weapon and/or combat innate
procs (procs from buffs like Divine Might or Jolting Blades)
that can occur on a single attack it gets messier (and they did
change that mechanic recently, don't recall the new rules off-
hand).

First, proc rate is per minute, not per attack round.  The chance
of a particular proc occuring on a particular attack (regardless
of the number of swings for characters with double or triple
attack) is adjusted by the game engine based on your current
weapon delay (i.e. haste/slow afffect the chance to proc on a
given attack round).  (This has been verified by numerous parses
and is accepted as a given on the class boards I read.)

Second, secondary slot equipped weapons proc at half the rate of
primary equipped, all things being equal.  So if you have a weapon
that procs 5x per minute (average) in primary, it will proc 2.5x
per minute (average) in secondary.  Thus two weapons that would
each proc 5x per minute primary will give you 7.5 procs per minute
dual wielded.  These are all averages, each attack gets its own
check and streaks can and do happen from time to time.
