They were GM controlled, they always con indifferent.
Trakanon tonight conned indifferent.  One of our warriors was sent
into see if Trakanon would "talk" to us.  Trak attacked the warrior
before anything could be said...BIG mistake.

About 30 people from our guild considered that an "Act of Aggression".
Trakanon, even GM controlled, lived for exactly 20 seconds.  Drops
were:  Brell's Girdle, Seb Berserker Cloak and Dragonscale Mask.
Normal Trakanon loads are better....
