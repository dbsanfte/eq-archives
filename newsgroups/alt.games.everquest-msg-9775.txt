Back when it was only considered inconsiderate to smoke in elevators,  I used to carry a aerosol-horn - one of the REALLY loud ones.  Loud
enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  For those instances where some AH refused to put out his/her cig, I'd say, "Gee,
I have my own little habit.  This relaxes me, and if you don't enjoy it, just don't listen."  Then I'd set that horn off for the duration of
my elevator ride.

After all, I had every right to enjoy my little habit, didn't I?  ...and I know any studies linking second-hand noise to hearing loss were
done by tree-hugging puritans, anyway.
