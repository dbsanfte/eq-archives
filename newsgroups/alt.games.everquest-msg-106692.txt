Well, there is some benefits in removing the twinking ability.  First off,
new generation players won't get into the begging mode with higher ups...
The benefits of higher level gear won't go to the lower levels for the pure
fact that they didn't flat out earn it.

Now while you paid the money to get it for your lower level, the lower
level newbies will see that while it looks cool, it won't be much use until
later on.  So while they get some of the less uber weapons and armor
normally...  It may encourage them to go, "Hey...  Just cause he has some
really cool stuff, doesn't make him any better than me with what I get
normally."

I am personally tired of lowbies coming up to me and going, "Plat plz" "Do
you have anything to spare for a <race> <class>?".  Most of the gear I have
gotten for my main, was from spending money or working a place.  Offering
donation buffs and Bank runs as a Druid.  When I ran across high levels, I
only ask if they had anything they cared to unload, and only when they
asked for something I could offer to them.  If they didn't, I give them
their buff and sit back down, wishing them well on their journey.

It might just also eliminate the majority of the no-drop stuff...  I mean,
I would love to be able to get other items later on, like the long wait
spawns.
