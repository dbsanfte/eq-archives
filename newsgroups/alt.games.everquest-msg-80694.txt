Ack, why didn't I think of that? I knew they were SKs,
and my main's a cleric...

Sure I would! I was fairly sure we would die, though, but
the wizzie whisked us away to NK, so no problem.

Eh, scratch that one then... Until the bard catches up with us,
at least. Any bards want to chime in with when bards get to be
good crowd controllers?

I'm leaning towards this one now, as it's the dungeon I know
best... I *must* get some shrinkage first, though. Well, I
don't have to, but it'll make this one much easier...

Hey, I like MM. It's a death trap with atrocious pathing,
sure, but I still like it...

Cool, will keep that one in mind then.

Blechh, I thought the LGuk eye was a wizard... We'll hit MM first
then, and pick up some blood. None of us have RM yet, and Endure
doesn't offer much MR...
