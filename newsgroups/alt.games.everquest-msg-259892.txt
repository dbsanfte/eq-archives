Yes, you were easy to provoke.

I have a self-diagnosed mildish case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
which does, in fact, make me anal in several areas of my life.  This
plays to my advantage in some respects, though; as a long-time
software engineer, I think it's an advantage: my personal experience
tends to support my conclussion that people without at least mild OCD
tend to make poor, sloppy software engineers.

In any case, don't be so offended that I called you out for quoting a
large message just to insert a single line comment.  It was mildly
offensive, but hey, at least you learned something valuable from it,
right?
