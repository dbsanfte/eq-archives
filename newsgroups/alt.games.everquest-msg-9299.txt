Well, I don't have enemies as such. I mean, this is only Usenet after
all, and it really doesn't warrant that strong of a reaction as far as
I'm concerned. I wouldn't be surprised if some people think of me as
an enemy, but that's their perspective and I really don't care.

As for driving them into a spastic frenzy, you're probably right on
target with that. I wouldn't know for certain since, well, they're
kill filed. If there are ever replies to my posts by them, I don't see
them - and that is the whole point of course. If they're getting
spastic, that's entirely their own problem - my only objective in kill
filing people is to ensure that I don't waste any more time reading
their posts.
