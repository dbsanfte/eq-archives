I am lucky on my bard as I have headslot, wrists and gloves which are all
non-graphic. I can't help but think it looks a little dumb to have a
singing/instrument playing character to be in plate gloves with tin can on
it's head. With no wrist, arms, or head armour she actually looks like she
could attempt to play a musical instrument.
