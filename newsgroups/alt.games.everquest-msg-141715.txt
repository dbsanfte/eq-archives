Last three times he's popped on Morell Thule he's hung out for quite a
ways past that.  Most recently, for 2 hours 50 minutes, the two times
before that, three hours and one second.  I know, cause I was in on the
kill all three times, in fact the second time I got the kill shot on the
dragon
version.  Unfortunately, this does NOT mean I got my heart... but I did
get this swell (POS) breastplate (ok, its got 20 SvF)
