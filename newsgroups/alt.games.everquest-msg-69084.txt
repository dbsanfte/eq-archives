  Yeah, but of course, for a while, 3dfx was the undisputed king.  Two
years down the road, who knows, maybe somebody will release a string
of innovative products that put NVIDIA's offerings to shame, the same
way NVIDIA put the beatdown on 3dfx about the time the original TNT
came out.

  I kind of doubt it, though.  NVIDIA seems to be making solid,
periodic advances, while 3dfx didn't really seem to make any
substanial improvements in their underlying technology.  Heck, with
the VooDoo5 they were still trying to "brute force" it with SLI.  I
think though that if ATI can straighten up their act, they might be
able to survive against NVIDIA and be competitive, especially if they
can preserve their dominance in the 2D/video niche.

  Yeah, you're probably right.  I think the RADEON 8500 includes
similar technology as well.

  Yeah, when you can get one of the less expensive GeForce2 cards for
about the same price as a Kryo II, it's kind of hard to not go with
"tried and true" NVIDIA.

  BTW, the nForce chipset technically is a motherboard chipset and not
a graphics chipset, I believe.  I think nForce motherboards have some
sort of GeForce2-based graphics subsystem.  Personally from the
preview benchmarks I've seen and the things I've read, the idea of the
nForce doesn't really excite me too much.  I don't really like the
idea of having a GeForce2 going to waste stuck on my motherboard,
since if I'm willing to pay for an nForce, I'm probably just as
willing to pay for a GeForce 3 Ti200 or a RADEON 8500, or whatever
card happens to be the best price/performance deal.  The nForce does
score points for powering the X-Box, though. :)  If it brings that
sort of graphical power to the PC, it'll be worth every dime.
