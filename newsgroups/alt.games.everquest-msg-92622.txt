Yes, thought it was my computer until I upgraded to AMD XP1700+, new Nvidia
card, 640MB memory and still had the lag problem.  Seemed worse in Shar
Vahl, less in Shadeweaver's Thicket.  Checked to see how many others were in
zone and found out there were only about six others at any given time.  This
is on the roleplaying only server.
