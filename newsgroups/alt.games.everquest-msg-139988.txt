None of them.  Tradeskills are a major money sink.  None of them are
particularly fast.  All but Jewelcrafting require you to get rare drops off
mobs you can't kill at level 26 in order to make the really worthwhile
items.  Jewelcrafting requires an enchanter to make the items that are
worthwhile.

That being said, I have been working on all of the tradeskills.  What can I
say?  I'm a masochist, and a broke one at that.
