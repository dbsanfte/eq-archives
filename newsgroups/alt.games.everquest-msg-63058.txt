As one of the people who touts the ridiculous "this is a wargame"
horsecrap, I can't believe you actually beleive this. Go back to the 12th
century, and ask any footsolder who he is fighting, with these 2 options:
1) The enemy
2) The guy standing in front of him waving a sword

Melee/short ranged combat is not about high flying Us Vs Them, it is about
HIM vs ME. It is only because character death isn't permenant that you can
attach any kind of greater meaning to the combat at all.
