I've no idea what the raw number of mobs required is to get out of the
shithouse with CoV, but there's a fast easy way to do it. Try to find a
guild doing a Kael arena raid and ask if you can go along for faction
only. Most won't mind if you're not looting. Stay off to the side and
just toss some really light damage spells at the giants they are taking
down. (and be ready to hightail it if things go south. he he). One good
raid in there and you'll get some serious CoV faction.
