Well, if you get "bored" you CAN kill other stuff. But you cannot miss it 
when Gynok or his ACTUAL placeholder spawns because that creature shouts 
to the whole dungeon something along the lines of "You have disturbed my 
rest, now suffer as I have!" Even the rat PH. If you're down on the third 
floor or right by the exit, you'll know when Gynok or his PH spawns.
