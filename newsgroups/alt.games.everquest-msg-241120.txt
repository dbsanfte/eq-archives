}He might mean the little boat (canoe) that usually stays at "Sister Isle" in
}OOT.  If so, I have to say that a friend got that thing working once, but I
}was never able to.  

It's pretty simple, once you know what to do.  Stand on the canoe, hit 
page down to shift your view until you can see the bottom of the boat, and 
mouseclick on it (can't remember if it's left or right, but the other one 
does nothing, so just hit both. :) ) You will get a message, "You have the 
helm, captain" (presumably, it won't work if someone else already has the 
helm...) and then you can hit home to re-level your view, and use the 
arrow keys to move the whole boat around.

It's really a pretty pointless exercise, as you go no faster than someone 
with a swimming skill of 100ish, but I have a very fond memory from 
several years ago...  My baby ogre shaman was touring the Ocean of Tears, 
and found it difficult to board the big boat at either sister's isle or 
brother's isle, since he's kos at both places.  So...  I tooled around on 
a canoe, and set up a boating accident, mostly just to see what would 
happen. :)  I parked my canoe directly in front of the big boat, and 
readied my screenshot key. (I wonder what I ever did with those pictures?  
Ahh well.)  What happened was, the two boats passed through each other.  
And since I was on the canoe, I also passed through the wall of the big 
boat, and found myself in the bar below decks.  Seizing the opportunity, I 
jumped off the canoe and rode off to Butcherblock.  :)  It wasn't until 
later that I discovered the much simpler trick of swimming onto the big 
boat at the moment it leaves the docks.  Something about the transition 
from stationary to mobile makes the walls permeable for just a second.

}I did find swimming from Sister Isle to the nearby
}islands pretty safe even at level 16 (not sure if there are supposed to be
}sharks in the water).  Of course, you have to be careful once you get on the
}various islands, but I was fine swimming.

Yea, I just re-learned that 'be careful' warning again the other night.  I 
was wanting to head over to brother isle (because, the reef shark by the 
docks there -does- occasionally drop the Collector's Shark Tooth. Spawn 
time is 2.5 minutes, but it's about a 1 in 20 drop ) so upon arrival at 
sister isle, I clicked my spifty fabled jboots and lev'd myself, aimed 
carefully and headed out across the zone.  Since that would take about 10 
minutes or so, I went to help my GF put away groceries.  Unfortunately, I 
hadn't aimed as carefully as I thought...  I came back just in time to see:

The Fabled Allizewsaur hits you for 1998 damage!
You have been slain by The Fabled Allizewsaur!
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

Oh, criminy.  I'd never even been entirely sure which island he was on...  
Needless to say, I'm sure now. :)
