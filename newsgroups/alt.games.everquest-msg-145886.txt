    Yes, and no. People who were soloing, or at the front of Chardok, in
Sebilis, in HS, in FG, in Velk's spiders.... they're going to be moving, if
they were level 60. But there's a ton of space out there for them. The Deep,
Ssra, Maiden's Eye, Umbral Plains, PoG, CT - all will see population
increases as people realize that now the good XP/unit time is in these
places. Hell, there's actual named mob camps in The Deep, but up until now
the only people you saw there were camping THO/Burrower/lucid
shards/serubane components/the zone-in.

    Oh, and there's one camp in FG that'll still have people at it, if
they're smart. ;-)
