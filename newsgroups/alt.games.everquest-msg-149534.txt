    Warriors also have to deal with things in the way, like pets, unshrunk
players, and medding casters when they start their pin. Not an easy job.

    This is part of why we went with hybrids for low end trash MAs - they
can get the aggro so fast, whereas our warriors would be unable to prevent
people from being eaten or would be in a situation where AoE Taunt would get
them eaten.

    Assume you're MA. Is this pull too much for you, period? If so, get on
whatever of the robes are daughter (second) spawns and hope you kill them so
people who camp have a clean camp when they return. If it's winnable, ignore
Qua, Qua, Zov, Zov (mezzable). Non-warrior offtanks can handle Zun and both
those Pli, and the Pli Zethon's AoE nuke should be containable if you have
space to move it aside when offtanking (far side of alcove, far wall in a
hallway, far wall at base of staircase). Pli Thall is only mildly annoying
since the blind nerf, rather than raid-threatening. Only a warrior can
offtank the Eom Centien and survive long, so get on it. Use judgement as to
when/if to pop Evasive, depending on likelihood of healing, how quickly you
see it being slowed, and also how much aggro you've managed to build. AoE
Taunt is NOT an option here, so being able to hold aggro is an important
issue.

    How'd I do? Be easy on me - I'm just a cleric!
