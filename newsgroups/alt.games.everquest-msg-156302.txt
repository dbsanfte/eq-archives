  "Currently at 60, the Slay Undead paladin has certainly invested a great
deal of points into the power given by slay undead. This is a large and
meaningful advantage for the paladin, in that it brings him up greatly in
situational damage with absolutely no downside. There is nothing inherently
wrong with that.
  The issue is that there are no amount of AAs the warrior can buy to also
raise his situational damage by such a large amount. This means that before
AA, the paladin is always producing somewhat less damage than a warrior; and
after AA the paladin is sometimes producing as much damage as a warrior at
60th level. This problem grows more noticeably in margin post 60 and becomes
an increasing issue in Planes of Power.

  We've intentionally tried to add more undead creatures to give classes
with situational advantages a place to use them. We want people to be able
to make use of their anti-undead spell lines, their anti-summoned spells,
and of course any specialty AAs. However, the amount of gain given by Slay
Undead is too good to have no downside associated with it. Classes need to
stay in relative balance with roughly equal AA expenditures.

  We like the idea of this ability from a roleplaying and a gameplay
standpoint. But it needs to be altered to make it more balanced. So we'll be
making a change to Slay Undead and refunding the points for this AA ability
on Monday.

  NOTE: We've also changed the way that the refund works. Unspent AA points
over 30 will only be deleted when you first zone after the patch. So you
will have time to spend these points after you log in but before you zone.

  We will be changing Slay Undead in two ways.

  The ability will now be activated by a button. You will be able to turn it
on and off as you see fit. The drawback is that using this ability requires
the attention and intense focus of the Paladin. His intensity leaves him
vulnerable to attacks, while inspiring the undead to greater strength.
Strikes made against the Paladin using Slay Undead will do more damage than
they usually do.

  We wanted to let you know before the change goes Live on Monday.

I had retired my monk, because trying to farm the 60 K to buy a fungus tunic
to be able to solo again was the most boring thing I ever attempted (you are
a monk, therefore verant says you are supposed to eschew worldly
possessions, but the fact is that a monk is far more dependent on gear than
a caster) and started up a paladin. By just fighting undead, I could make a
go of soloing, although it was a lot harder, and as I levelled, kept getting
so.

Got my ghoulbane and thought, well at least in the long run i'll be really
effective, with the aa point anti undead ability. Wrong. Ability gone. You
now have to buy plane of power to get the same ability back apparently.



Does anyone know of any class that verant is not going to nerf? Druid
perhaps? Or will they just decide to make quadding more interesting by
removing area effect spells unless you buy planes of power?



Not impressed. Was playing with the old delete button last night. I've
really loved the complexity and social aspects of eq, but if a developer is
going to remove abilities and only replace them if you send them more money,
then you have to wonder if you really want to be a part of their blackmail.
