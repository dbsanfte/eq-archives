If a plausible rational can be given for why faries are evil or enemies 
of the gods, which I have not heard. Near as I can tell they keep to
themselves in thier own little corner of Lesser Faydark, (well kept to
themselves till they got turned into undead sprites).

I have this image of a Tunare worshiping paladin wandering thru the farie
village, looking at the cute little faries, and killing them one by one, 
looting, killing, looting... dozens of farie corpses laying at his
feet, and wondering how he can go home to face his family. Thinking that 
he should have been a ranger, because they don't have to do shit like 
this.

I really think it is a task better suited for a shadowknight or necromancer.
