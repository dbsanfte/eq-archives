/sigh.  displayed ac over 153 is compared to displayed ac of 59 with
dramaticly different results when attacked by identical mobs.  displayed
ac had no direct effect on combat in the case observed.  period.

Your statement, "Levels > gear", is plainly false for the example I
gave (and if you want your levels plural changed the naked warrior to
L42).  When you insist on "no qualifiers" you are insisting that your
statement is true in all cases.  Differences in gear can have a greater
impact than 2 or 3 or 4 (or in the case of magic weapon vs. no magic
weapon, 20) levels difference.  If you would care to make a more
accurate statement I'll be glad to consider it.
