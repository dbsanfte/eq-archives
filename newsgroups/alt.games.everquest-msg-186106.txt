I have played EQ for several years, I started with a warrior Braverose, left
when she when was lvl 12, mind you, times where different then and that
really took a long time. In between I had a huge break like 2 years. I came
back, and my warrior was still there!!!

 I started an enchanter wich is now lvl 55 Deserttears and she became my
main char. But still had fun playing my warrior sometimes. Deserttears was
doing good so i did some tranfers, which i worked hard for killing spiders
for hours for silk, pelts, giants, so i gave Braverose a Centi longsword an
Ember Blade and other stuff. Now last week (bit longer) Braverose died in
DSP, really never bothered about decaying time before, normally get it right
away, and i thought it was about 2 weeks, I was WRONG!! Its a week.

 While I was playing Deserttears and i was doing good lvl'ling I left
Braverose, yesterday i thought it was time to get her corpse and it was
GONE! How could I be so stupid??

I contacted a GM still thinking it must have been a mistake, but he told me
he would seek contact with higher GM (he was a guide) and see if he could do
something, but doubted it. I know this is very much me own fault, but what I
want to know is, did someone have had a similar situation, and was it
solved?

I am devistated right now, but will take the loss if I need to, some
positive comments will help though, thanks,
