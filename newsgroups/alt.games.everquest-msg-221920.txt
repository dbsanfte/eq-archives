I play most classes. Maybe that gives me a certain bit of objectivity.

Please. The devs might lend us an ear, but it has to be huge public 
outcry for it to actually effect change which would be [so clearly 
against the best interests of the game].

I've been known to play the role of Grasshoppa on occasion, but I don't 
think this is one.

Of course that's all purely subjective, unless you have credible sources 
to cite.

Never played one, I take it? I always had a ball with mine. There's also 
that class defining feign death thing that still gives them quite the leg 
up.

Again, subjective. I say what they lost didn't hurt them so badly unless 
viewed through the fractured lenses of the Min-Maxxer's Glasses of Common 
Misconception. 

You have gotten better at perpetuating misinformation! (200)

One point on which we agree completely.
