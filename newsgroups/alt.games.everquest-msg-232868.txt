It's mentioned in the latest patch message.  As far as I know, it will
use bone models to created all mobs (including PCs as mobs), instead
having to update every single vertext for every single point on every
single plane of every single mob's model.  I dont know much about this
aside from a very basic idea, and even that idea may be wrong.  What I
do know is that they claim it will improve graphics while reducing the
load on the processor, making zoning almost instantaneous for most
computers.

Now that would be nice.
