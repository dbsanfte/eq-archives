i'm positive i can answer the easy part - the castle you see is on faydwer -
its the zone from greater faydark into felwithe

now, about the druid question - i'm not going to say a lot because i'm
positive everyone's going to have something to say . . .

druids are the most independent class in EQ, and more than any other char,
you can tailor your druid to your playing style, SO what you've got to do is
find what niche the group is missing

the "answer" you're looking for is different for every group . . . with a
sloppy healer (or without one) that's your mana use * * if it looks as
though you're not particularly essential to a group, then buff everyone
(again, unless a bard is doing that) * *

at 26 or 27, there's no problem to ask other "versatile" characters how
they're playing at that instant, but you're right in that it would be, in a
way, unprofessional to ask a general question of what to do . . . i just
mean that when i group up with my druid, i might ask, for example, if the
bard is up to AOE mezzing because then i wont use my AOEs and break mez

and the running gag (one which becomes unfunny very quickly) is that you're
generally not supposed to tank, BUT its even MORE unacceptable for you to be
the wizard . . . everyone hates the druid who wants to be a wizard

sorry if my words are the cause of the spawn of more words . . . just my 2cp
here
