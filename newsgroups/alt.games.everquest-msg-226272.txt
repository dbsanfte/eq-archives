Fun! Congrats on the experience, it's exhilirating that first time, isn't
it.

This is the biggest problem with groups in general, it just gets amplified
in raid situations and then to the ultimate in pickup raids. Discipline is
hard to enforce in a game made up of voluntary participants, and good
communication and general leadership skills become key. I was lucky the
first time I went on a Naggy raid, having someone with those qualities and a
fairly well organized effort. It also didn't hurt that we had at least 50...
But, communication is key.

Did you watch the FV ezboard and track the open raids there? Not quite
"pickup", they're sort of a hybrid, being organized usually by some guild,
but accepting anyone who shows up. Tactics, plans, times and locations, etc
are discussed in the forums.
