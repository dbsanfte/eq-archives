I know the first thing is divide dmg/delay and the higher the ratio the more
damage.  But then for weapons that have ratios that are close but one might
also have other beneficial properties like proc, +fire dmg, +atk, etc, how
can I decide if one is better than the other?  Do I need to parse the log
file or are there some rules of thumb I could use?
