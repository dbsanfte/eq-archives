Hmmn, this may be own of those US English Vs Other Flavour English thing, as
"I have stooped.." is quite legitimate here in Australia at least.

To stoop is to lower yourself. Literally, one may need to stoop to enter a
low doorway and it's meaning is basically "lower oneself". It is much more
commonly used figuratively to indicate someone has performed a low act
somehow.

For example

"There is no need to stoop to namecalling, we are all adult enough to
discuss this rationally."

"I am so poor I stooped to accepting a ride from someone in a Lada
yesterday."
