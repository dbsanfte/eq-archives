I think that to a large extent, PoP is to blame for that change, not
the lull/pacify changes. Before PoP, even if you had some way to pull
singles, there wasn't really any need to bother if you had some type
of crowd control (and a good group). 

The basic design of the of the PoP mobs kinda forced people to start
looking for single pulls because mob damage in exp groups suddenly
jumped from 200 to 600 at the high end. Most groups just weren't
equiped to deal with multiple pulls under those circumstances. One
resist and your enchanter/shaman went splat. Things like the GoD
trials just take it to further extremes. 

I don't blame the pacify changes as much as the design shift towards
high DPS, low HP mobs for the lack of fun crowd control these days.
