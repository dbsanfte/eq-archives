Force? I can take the nexus to paineel and get al the bone chips myself
faster than running though newbie zones auctioning.
I dont understand why there arnt any bone hip vendors, especially when you
consider the amount some buy (check out the newbie vendors in any zone with
skels). Running around checking the vendors for the odd bone chip takes
longer too.

Probably would be prety easy these days with the /auction channel, if you
have a druid/wiz alt.
