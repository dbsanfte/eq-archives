I'd like to know how your encumberance affects your movement speed.
If my strength is say 85, and I have 65 of weapons/armour/loot, can I only
run 76% of my max speed?
Lately, with all the stuff that I carry, I seem to have noticed that I run
more slowly than before.
When I hit the 85 encumberance limit, I do notice a speed decrease.
Has this always been the case? Am I just stoned? Is playing till 4 am for 2+
weeks finally getting to me?

Thanks in advance for any help.
