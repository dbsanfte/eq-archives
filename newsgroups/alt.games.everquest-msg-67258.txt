I love the new models myself, particularly the barbarians and trolls.  On
the whole I'm very happy with Luclin.  I think the new landscapes and
graphics are awesome when put in perspective to the scale of the game.
Sure it's not as slick as some of the FPS's but given it's scale and
content I wouldn't expect it to be.

I originally had a video driver problem when first patching over to SOL,
but thanks to this newsgroup I was able to fix that issue quickly.  I will
say that I do have some lag on the moon, but none on the Old world that
I've noticed.  I guess I may go ahead and buy a little more RAM but on the
whole I think I've been lucky given the complaints I've seen.
