You have a good mix of weapons there, the Ebon razor is a great sword but
I'd suggest moving to a SSoY for primary now, it's ratio is slightly less
than the razor but it when you hit 37 and it starts proc'ing 75dd's it's
lovely (saying this I haven't had much luck with my pair, recently, think
the batteries are duff) other than that I'd not change, maybe a quicker off
hand, Crystallized Sword 11/29 should be about 6 or 700.
The other, obvious, choice is the big 'ol gardening tool, the Wormslayer ;�P
25/40 AC5 +5 str +5 MR, as much as I hate the look of it they don't come
much better and as under 4k NOTHING comes close, better damage delay than
Exe Axe that has just Proc'd haste.
A dream partner for that would be Viik's Dark Defender, War only piercer
7/20 +10ac  (but cost is about 8k atm) +15ac from 2 weapons :�)

2hdr not sure what you have atm. Mith 2hder's are about 2k these days but I
have seen them for 1k (look to spend 1.5k if you're after one) the Mith
Satff, as mentioned earlier, is a fantastic weapon if you can weather the
learning of 2hb from scratch. Jarsath Battle Sword and Earthen Blade are
nice (26/45 or 26/50 + haste proc. Respectively) both should be under 1k
now, the earthen blade around 600pp

Dream 2hder for me, atm is Felhammer, seen them for under 10k on more than
one occasion and with some of the 2hders available in Velious that sort of
price will prolly be more common, that's what I am working on but as none
twink only slightly higher than you it'll prolly be a couple of levels
before I have that sort of plat.

Armour wise, not much better than crafted for you, Cobolt is dropping in
price (except the BP) but even then it's still pricey (seen Gaunts for 4k)
and Treeweave is a good choice of chest slot (ac25 +10str)
