In almost any country you will find people who secretly or openly fund
various terrorist organizations.  I'm not saying it's ok but if you do the
research I guarantee you that whatever country you live in you'll find cases
where some of your own citizens have been found to be donating to terrorist
organizations.  The fact that some Americans have donated to various
terrorist organizations (hell, the guys who bombed WTC were legal
residents!) is hardly enough to argue that America is the Great Satan.

Yup.  And since a couple guys were found in London manufacturing ricin...
The UK is the Great Satan!  Let's invade London!  Kill all the British,
they're evil terrorist supporters!  Kill them all!  Kill them all!
