LOL. Temp does not equal God mode. You can still get yourself killed 
with temp on. You know that. Ever meet Dvinn in CB? Think any temped 
lowbie is gonna take him down? How about adds? How about the fact that 
for a warrior temp only extends the period of time before his health 
falls to low levels with contiued fighting anyway. Don't worry. He'll 
die. It just won't be quite so often. And I don't see that as a problem, 
neither did I ever find it boring when I was a temped lowbie.

Oh, and by the way. It is not fun to play Doom on God mode ever.

Just my two coppers.
