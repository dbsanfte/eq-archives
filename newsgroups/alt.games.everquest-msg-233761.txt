Actually you did several things that are wrong:

1) You posted the oldest pyramid scam on the internet, a variant of
the old "make money fast." I remember when I saw the first post about
this, it was around the time the internet started to go to hell.

2) You posted what is an illegal postal lottery. You should really 
check things like that before you go and try to commit federal
offenses.

3) You posted it in bad faith, likely not even sending any money to
any of the other persons. Though you sent no money to any of the other
persons on the list, it evidently never dawned on you that NO ONE EVER
SENDS MONEY TO THE PEOPLE ON THE LIST. 

I don't really think of federal offenses as "minor mistake"s.
Its best to do some research before you leap.

AAHAH these links take me back, if you don't remember the history of
"make money fast", I think David Rhodes was the guy starting it:

http://www.stopspam.org/usenet/mmf

"For example, Dave Rhodes spent a number of years in a Federal Prison
(and may still be there for all I know) for his starting of this whole
scheme electronically back in the days of the Bulletin Board Services
instead of the internet. Whether disguised as a "mailing list,"
"selling recipes," a "free loan," "selling reports," a "gifting club,"
"lottery ticket club," or any of a hundred other thin veils, they are
still chain letters, and still illegal."


"The United States Postal Inspector's office Chain Letter Page has
this to say about them:

" There's at least one problem with chain letters. They're illegal if
they request money or other items of value and promise a substantial
return to the participants. Chain letters are a form of gambling, and
sending them through the mail (or delivering them in person or by
computer, but mailing money to participate) violates Title 18, United
States Code, Section 1302, the Postal Lottery Statute. (Chain letters
that ask for items of minor value, like picture postcards or recipes,
may be mailed, since such items are not things of value within the
meaning of the law.)ï¿½

and later on the same page, it says:

"Do not be fooled if the chain letter is used to sell inexpensive
reports on credit, mail order sales, mailing lists, or other topics.
The primary purpose is to take your money, not to sell information.
'Selling' a product does not ensure legality." "


That last bit is in regard to the make money fast variants where you
were supposed to post one recipe in the body of the letter, supposedly
then turning it into a "legal selling of recipes list." Obviously, it
still is not legal. Its even illegal to take part in the sending of a
lottery ticket across state lines, which these scams by definition
fall under.
