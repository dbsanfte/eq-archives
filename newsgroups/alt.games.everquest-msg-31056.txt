I think it stikes a fundamental chord that runs through our human
psyche or rather our cutural collective psyche. That  is best descrided
as the Fankenstein's monster complex. When Mary Shelley wrote that
book it was wildly popular in its day and remains a 'classic' as it played
upon the public fears of science and technology.

Even today there is panic about cloning and many people are calling
for the banning of it. Why? Simply because it encroaches on the man
vs. machine or in this case the broader man vs. nature. We are messing
with things only god can do right. Like the line from JP 3 "No... This is how
you play god."

What people fail to understand is that technology is not in itself inherrently
dangerous or evil, but its use and application that are. Look at nuclear
power/energy for example, hell even gunpowder.

The time that computers will be able to actually think is VERY far off.
There is a lot more complexity to the human brain and mind than most
people think.
