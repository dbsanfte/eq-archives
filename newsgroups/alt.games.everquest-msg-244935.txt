I am running a heavily twinked Monk, he has Fungus Tunic and also enough
Bazaar level items to get his AC to 1100 and with Virtue his HPs are at over
3300, all of this at level 46.  That said, he still gets the crap beat out
of himself when grouped in LDoNs.  I have not taken him to any of the POP
zones but it is safe to assume he will get the crap beat out of himself
there too.  Until they fix the class it is probably best to not start a
monk.  A monk with only the gear he or she can obtain on their own is pretty
much a paralyzed character for any encounter post Kunark.
