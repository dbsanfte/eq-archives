Stuns can be very effective use of mana.  Or they can be really stupid 
use of mana.  Even when they aren't stupid, in some cases they are used 
for one thing and some they are used for another, and in some for a 
third, and even a fourth and they require radically different approaches 
and using the wrong approach can be disasterous.

Use One: Stop casters.  Certain spells that caster mobs use can really 
ruin your day, others are more on the nuisance level, and some, well, 
you're glad they are casting  instead of meleeing.  To stop casters 
there are two approaches; chain stun (memorize 3 or 4 stuns and cast one 
after another, timing things so the target is never out from under stun 
for long.) and responsive stun; watching for the mob to start casting, 
and slipping a stun in, hopefully with a cast time so low that you 
finish before the mob does.

Chain Stun can be effective, but its a bit of a mana hog, and its a 
tiger by the tail situation; if you stop, you probably have the mob's 
total attention.

Responsive stun works very well against long casting spells, 
particularly Cheal (who wants to watch their victim suddenly get all 
their HP back... gee, how demoralizing must seeing a cleric in the group 
be for the mobs?), but poorly against fast casting spells like many 
wizard type mobs have... and it requires you have those mob cast 
messages in a window where you can see them, and quick reflexes... and 
might distract you from your party's hp bars.

Use Two: Cleric Slow.  Cleric stuns last 6 seconds... thats six seconds 
when the mob isn't hitting anything at all.  The low level stuns are 
cheap to cast, and if you take out say 6 seconds of every 24, thats like 
a 25% slow, one that works with other slows.  Trouble is with the long 
recast time, to step that up takes more stuns memmed, and the cast cost 
goes up... you can even go all the way to chain stun again, thats a 100% 
slow (except for the odd resist) but it gets pretty mana intensive... 
and there's that tiger by the tail thing again.

Use Three: Cleric Snare.  Stop a runner for 6 seconds and he's very 
often dead.  Need more?  Mem a second stun and you've got him for 12 
seconds.  Anything to stop  a runner going and getting help.  You can 
also use this for slowing down a mob pulling back to the group; stun him 
to pull, run back to the group, stun again on arrival and hope by the 
time it wears off the MT has the mob's attention.

Use Four: Cleric MT.  As others have mentioned, stuns are high aggro. 
If you are partnered with a rogue or ranger or even a monk, someone 
who's not too good at getting hit but is pretty good at smashing things 
from behind.  Stuns can really help hold onto aggro... and of course 
shortly after you let up your buddy will be able to get aggro back so 
you can heal yourself.  Here the trick is to stun as little as you can 
get away with, but at a minimum whenever the mob turns away from you (if 
you didn't want him to)
