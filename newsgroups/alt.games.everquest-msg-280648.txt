/quote from another post:

... took half a million divided it by 52, got 9615 
and then guessed that the servers were supporting up to 10,000 players.

/end quote

Whether your columnist did that math or SOE did it really doesn't 
matter. It was certainly true at some point in time, that just over half 
a million players were served by 52 servers, and thus approximately 10k 
/ world server.

The EQ worlds of 2005, run on newer hardware, with dynamic load 
balancing accross world server clusters, severing an ever expanding game 
with more and more realestate for people to spread into, both interms of 
zones, and zone-instances. Its likely that world servers can support 
much larger player counts than they could "once upon a time".

Especially if non-trivial quantities of players are splitting their time 
with other titles now.
