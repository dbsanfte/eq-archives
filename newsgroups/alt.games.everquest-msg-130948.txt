Problem is (on Prexus at least) hes a really contended spawn.  Other people
WILL camp him all the time.. so if you just keep checking back in, hes
likely to be camped.

Of course you could get lucky and they are AFK/LD, but some would consider
that rude.  Not sure why tho.. AFK - well tough shit, do you really expect
people to wait x hours for you to return?

LD?  Well if you KNEW they were camping it and went LD then fair enough its
rude.. but otherwise, how on earth would you know, if you just popped into
the zone?

I love the "hey!!!  I've been here for the last 5 hours!!"  when you saw
them arrive 10 minutes ago :)
