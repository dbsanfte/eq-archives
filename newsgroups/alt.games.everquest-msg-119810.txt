When I start a new character, the first thing I do, is to put the
'Sense Heading' ability in the number 1 slot on the 'Abilities' Menu.

Next I place the hotkey in the same spot on several of the hotkey
panels.

Finally I use the 'Keyboard' menu to assign the 'arrow up' as a
shortcut to that particular button on the hotkey panels.

Voila - every time I use the 'arrow up' i.e. moves forward, I also
uses my 'Sense Heading' ability. This way I will have that ability at,
or near, its max  value at every level.

As I can invoke the 'Sense Heading' by using the /doability 1 in
macros, this line is included in almost every macro I've made.

Good luck on improving your skills 

/GF
