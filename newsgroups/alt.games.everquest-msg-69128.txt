This was a couple months ago, so I could be misremembering the name.   It was
panther type, but I don't think it was a Haze Panther.  Those were still blue
at 56, when I passed through.   The one that killed me was most definitely
green.  I don't think it was a normal panther either.    I wasn't killed by a
red while looking the other way.   I fought it for quite some time before
dropping, and I was somewhat close to surviving.
