Unless they are idiots about it, good tight filters should have no effect.

Our filters (work for my isp) completely shut out msblast and friends, and
sobig never got through our virus filters. And I don't have EQ login
problems. We didn't even change our filters last week. And noone got msblast
on our network (well, the guy who dials in through us and bellsouth, but he
got it from bellsouth, then we blocked his outbound when he logged into us).


Still, never know.

Glad you got going Annie. QoS is PoS if you ask me :)
