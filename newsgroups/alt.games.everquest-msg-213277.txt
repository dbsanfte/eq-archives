I'm find that I'm actually hoping they Nerf Paludal...   Paludal's
popularity is so high, that it is rare to see a 15-25 character in any other
zone (or so it seems...)  and people head to paludal earlier and earlier...
It seems like I can play my alts for days on end in the old world zones
without seeing more than one or two other players in a session...
