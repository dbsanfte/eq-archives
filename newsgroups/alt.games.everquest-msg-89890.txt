I can kill Luitenants in kael with just a druid (blue con to me at 60, hit
hard and have a chance of dropping armour)

With a 32 point damage shield, plus Potg, regen and heals, (not to mention
snare and big dots) a druid at 50-60 is much more effective than you may
think... they die faster then if I were grouped with a shaman

Saying that, It is more aimed at a monk+druid and not a warrior.. but the
shaman combination is primarily shaman+monk too (as far as warriors getting
beat down, nothing at all comes close to cheal)
