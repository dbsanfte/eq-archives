    HPs. Mana. Inherent resists. New defensive table (possibly). The ability
to scribe those 63 spells as you get them (hint: some of your spells 63+
aren't 63+ spells to other classes).

    From what I can see, the "high level XP bonus" was computed independent
of level. That is, that level 62 mob gives you the same XP at 60 and 65.

    I get an AA per two hours max at level 65. As you'll find out, once you
get to the "second tier" and beyond zones stuff just isn't green. Well,
except for the mobs left in specifically to be Dire Charmed. And there's
plenty of uncamped or sparsely camped things in the first-tier planes that
are nicely blue, like the hobgoblins in PoN.
