Are you sure about this?  I'm almost certain that as long as the final
turn-in is made by a character with the proper faction, the quest
would succeed.  Case in point, Rangers multiquest the Swirling Sphere
of Color for the Ranger epic all the time...and you need good faction
to do most of those turn-ins.

Happened to a friend of mine in Katta...he wasted three good Shissar
Organs because he didn't notice he had "completed" the quest with the
initial two turn-ins.
