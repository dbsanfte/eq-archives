Not true. All guilds start somewhere and it is fun to be there at the start
of something. Not everyone gets a kick out of joining an established guild,
where you can get lost in a sea of people you don't know or care to know. We
choose our guild members carefully. So if anyone is still interested you
know what to do. An I only wished to brag about our wonderful web site not
put up an advert! The web site is good yes?
