Melee classes use it for corpse runs, while the casty types use it for
that they also use it for evacs and tactical bouncies around zones. As I
suggested in antoher post perhaps its worth considering the two functions
seperately.

Why a price...you can get the 'feeling much better' heal for free ad
infinitum in Nek Forest....why not freebie binds in guilds...if yer
faction is good enough you are OK. I think that would allow just about
anyone to get a bind at a sensible loc for CRs in most places.....
