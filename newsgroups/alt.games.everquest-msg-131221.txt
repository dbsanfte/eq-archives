}Does killing things in any of the Planes affect your faction with mobs
}back in the normal dimension?  Examples appreciated.  

Plane of Fear, you should be all right. 

Plane of Hate, there are some mobs on the second flor that can mess up 
factions with certain evil guilds, mostly named 'An <x> Emissary', where 
<x> is the guild they are there to represent.  It was neat conning Ally to 
something in Hate.  I still wish they'd given them a quest or something. 
:)

Plane of Air and Mischief, I have no idea.  Haven't been there yet. :)

}I'm particularly interested in the Plane of Growth (e.g. will Kelethin 
}elves hate me if I kill a lot of mobs there?).

No actually.  My understanding is that it takes about 3-4 mobs to go from 
ally to irreparably kos in felwithe, slightly more in Kelethin.  That's 
hardly "a lot"...  Ive never been there either, though, so this is 
hearsay.  Wouldn't do to end up KoS to my fiancee. :)
