I hear your pain. It gets better later on, as long as you dont get caught in
the wrong spots
Here are a few tips, saved my ass a few times

When you got a bunch of mobs on you, AE stun, and immediately mez. the stun
should buy you enough time to get a mez off. At level 51 I was still using
my level 20 stun for the fast cast time (1.5), but im switching over to the
52 one now because it seems to resist less. Not sure if the level 4 stuf
lasts long enough to pull off a mez, but if it doesnt you have a couple secs
to run back before the spell gems come back up

If someone dots a mob, np, just agro it somehow if possible, back away fromt
he group, AE stun it and root. If you cant shake the mob off someone, just
root it on the spot and tell party to back off

to keep yourself low on the agro list, its nice to keep mem blur up, but it
also will help if you wait a few secs after the tanks start hitting the mob
before you tashan or other debuff

well, thats all i can really think of at the moment, my head is cloudy....
hope this helps
