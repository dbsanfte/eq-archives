Even during the many levels of soloing that I did, I never once had SoC
memorized.  If I needed to run, I root parked the offending mob, and ran.  I
just did not have an open spell slot to have SoC memorized, and it's not
something you can swap in on a whim, it takes too long to become usable.
Regardless, it is hardly a spell that I feel that any class could not do
without.  It's handy once in an extremely long while, but hardly something
that I could not do without.  Heck, I have done without it really, as the
only time I ever used it was to see how fast it actually was.
