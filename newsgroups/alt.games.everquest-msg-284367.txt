When "buff filters" were added as part of the PoR launch (update
message of February 21, 2006), one of the features mentioned was
the ability to click off pet buffs and/or apply buff filters to
those as well.  I don't want to be the one who kills the golden-
egged goose, but it looks like this new feature has an unexpected
and perhaps unintended side effect.  During a recent LDON, a bard
in my group charmed a mob and discovered that he could then click
off its buffs!

I don't frequent the SOE forums.  Does anyone happen to know if
this has been mentioned there, and whether it's considered a bug
or a feature?

	-- Don.

p.s.: It *was* rather amusing when we had finished off the other
mobs and were waiting for charm to break so we could kill the pet.
The pet blew through mana recasting buffs a half dozen times with
the bard clicking them off as fast as they appeared.
