i'm happy you got to try these!

it used to be that the lockout existed for success only with a value of the 
remaining time left between the "recommended" time minus your actual time, 
although i'm sure i'm not calling the former by it's correct name....

i.e.,

progenitor, a super-popular one pre-PoR release, had a 'recommended' (again, 
sorry, not sure what the rule or name is) completion time of ~45 minutes 
(actually, it was less than that, wasn't it?), and if you won it in 25 
minutes, you waited around for the remaining time - 20, not a flat 15 
minutes


is the old way replaced by the new way for all MM's? or are PoR's just 
giving a 15 minute flat rate? i never noticed a flat lockout timer for 
winning dain missions...
