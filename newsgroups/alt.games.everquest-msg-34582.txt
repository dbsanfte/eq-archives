    Yay, more Quellians on the newsgroup! I'm guessing that our status as
"soap opera server" is what drives so many of us to be avid posters. ;-)

    I often wondered where that name came from. Never read any Jordan,

    (Note: on our server Vis Maior is the "top" guild.) I've often wondered
what the GMs, and the members of Vis, would do if someone named themselves
"Vis Major". Heck, at one point that's how they spelled it on their own web
site. ;-)
