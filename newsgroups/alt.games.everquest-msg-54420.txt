Had one of those morons in FoB last night. Playing my level 10 chanter
(hehe, playing with RL friend, wouldt go there just to level when i cant
shop), some monk ask for buffs. He get buffs, although im only on to max
my evocation skill, and need my mana.
Well, he pull a large scorpion, yellow to him, and need help. I kill the
scorpion, he get the XP. After doing that 3 times i just keep sitting and
medding while he died.

He didnt do it again.
