I've got a Linksys BEFW11S4 802.11b (wireless) router.  My desktop
(EverQuest) PC is attached via CAT5.  My laptop has built-in 802.11b.

My tests on the wireless laptop seem to conclude that the wireless
access to the router adds less than 10ms latency.  As a test I've
played EverQuest wirelessly and there was no perceivable performance
difference.

Go for 802.11b.
