Don't have any way of knowing yet. On paper it sounds like it might be
at least worth more than regular EQ but regular EQ sounds better than
it is if you look at verant's propaganda. We won't know about legends
until the 22nd when it goes live and people post:

"I GOT SO RIPPED OFF THIS SERVER SUCKS NOTHING HAPPENS I HATE VERANT
MY 29 EXTRA BUCKS IS GONE AND I HAVE TO WAIT 2 WEEKS TO GO BACK TO MY
OLD SERVER WHAT THE #$(#&*%(#&!(*&(*&Y@)(*&%(#*&!!!!!!! DIE!!!!"

Some stuff to remember is that everything, including that map where
you can tell where people are and where you have been, which is added
value is on the webserver except for the supposed interactions with
verant staff. Someone from verant verified that the map thing is
indeed on the webserver like your char thing is so its not something
you can do in game. Your regular EQ gameplay will be exactly the same
outside of the verant personel and evidently the new items to
"discover" or something. I still can't tell when reading that thing
though if they mean new items in an NPC sense like a drop on some new
npc or new items as in you get them from some verant staged event.

So the question is really "is it worth 40 bucks to play on an EQ
server exactly like yours but with supposedly more regular CS (which I
never actually require anymore) and some verant GM events (which any I
ever saw sucked) and that has some stuff on a web server you can play
with?"

I really don't think it would be to me. Too much of whether or not its
good depends totally on verant stafff and their events, your ability
to be at those events, whether or not 3,000 people are at the events
making it so they are laborious or impossible to attend, the fact that
you never get any event loot or even attention (if that floats your
boat) from verant staff due to the 3,000 other people there, etc.
