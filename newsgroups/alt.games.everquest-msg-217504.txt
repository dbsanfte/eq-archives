Since coming back to EQ a couple months ago, I've really enjoyed the
game.  1st with the general improvements to the old world (spell-book,
spellsets, the newbie changes sub-10th and armor quests).  Picking up
Luclin and then Evolutions both expanded my enjoyment  further.  Plus
the general emptiness of the old world was a nice, relaxing change of
pace.

Anyhoo, most of the problems thatdrove me away the first time (
shortly after Kunark) were fixed, save for a couple little things.  I
thought I'd see what your opinions of these are:

1)  /who all group  - preferably one that could ignore the /anon and
/roleplay tags.  Especially with the advent of LDoN, and the amount of
grouping I've been doing.  It's nice to know who you're dealing with.

1-a) by the same token, make it so that if you target someone, and do
a /who group, it would list who they are currently grouped with.  Just
as a proactive measure.

2) A rework of some of the old zones.   I understand that this may
take place ifa new engine does come out, as was hinted at Fan Faire,
but maybe it won't be the same thing.  Basically, bring some of the
chunky, angular old-world zones up to a Luclin or POP level of design.

Smooth some of the edges.  Nothing is more jarring than going from
some of the beautiful Luclin zones like DSP or Mons Letalis (okay, I
haven't seen that much of SoL; still) to some of the chunky old world
like ...well, all of it.

Anyhoo, smooth the egdes and give it a little buff and polish and make
it look more immersive.  They have the capability.

3)  Kinda like the (2) above, but put an end to the multi-zone cities.
If they can do Shadowhaven or Sanctus Seru, there's no reason Freeport
needs to be 3 zones.  Just join them and patch them.  Re-work the
architecture if you like to take out the 'transition areas', but
overall, clean things up.

Damn , I think thats it.   Not much to btich about anymore.  Back to
the game.
