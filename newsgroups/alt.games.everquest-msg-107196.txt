I'm talking about the Vah Shir Citizenship Quest.
I accidentally handed my initiates cloak I got from my elder to the wrong
person and never got it back. Is there a way to get a new one? I requier
this to complete my my Beastlord cats weapon quest.

I tryied getting a new slate from Mignah and taking it to the tax collector.
He gave me a letter for the king. I went to the king and got a new letter..
took it to the tax collecter and got a new usable slate... but he never gave
me the recommendation later for my elder so he can give me a new initiates
cloak =(

HELP! *pulls hair*
