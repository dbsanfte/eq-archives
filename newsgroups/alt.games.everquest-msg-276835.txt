I remember logging in as my brand-new, first level character, and
hailing what I thought was an NPC.  Turned out to be a druid
character, who chatted a bit with me.  After years of playing pen and
paper RPG's the concept of talking to a player not sitting around a
table with me was awesome!  (I had done this in Mechwarrior on-line
games, but somehow this seemed more momentous) I got what I soon
learnt was a SoW, as a free buff...  Thanked her, but didn't know what
the hell it was - still, it was cool though  :D

I also never forgot when some guy in Nektulos said that because the
Newbie Log was too crowded (Jeez, remember that being crowded?) he was
heading to East Commonlands, and did we want to come.  About 3 of us
did, all mighty level Dark Elves (well, at level 6 we thought we
were... heck, we could solo BEARS  :D) and we wandered in to EC.  We
trashed an Orc (Die, puny Pawn!) and figured all the other Orcs must
be just as easy... Nope - one wandering Legionnaire and we were toast.

My daftest ever exploit was helping a pal to get his body back after
Wuoshi killed him in two hits as he ported into the zone.  He phoned
me, unable to get to his corpse and needing help, and I suggested
that, although my druid was to low to take the dragon out, I could act
as bait to draw it off while he salvaged his stuff...  I stripped
nekkid (no plans on a corpse run!) ported in and ran like hell as soon
as I could, telling my pal to port in and recover his stuff while the
going was good.  Sure enough Wuoshi took off after me, and amazingly
(with luck and SoW) I got away from the arrival point without being
killed.  Even more amazingly, I had gained sufficient distance to be
able to gate out, only mildly beaten up  :)  He owed me some beers for
that, though, I can tell you.

Good times.
