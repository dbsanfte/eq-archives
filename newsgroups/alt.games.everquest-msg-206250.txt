    Gah. Encountered a bug with OE, sent this message early.

    To continue: what you may notice is the diminishing return on STA above
255. Below 255 you'll see that for every point of STA you get you'll get
about 3.3 HPs (at level 65).

    In the experiences of other clerics in my guild, you only get the
advantage against mobs that are lower than you in level. High ATK mobs and
yellow+ cons still pummel them just as badly.

    You could hit 6 K without elemental drops. Just depends on how many VT
drops you scoop. One of the highest HP clerics on my server didn't, until
the last month or so, have any elemental drops - he just whored out on loot
from outside elementals.
