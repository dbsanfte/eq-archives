On castersrealm (eq.castersrealm.com) they put up a newsitem discussing a
bunch of new spells.
They're supposed to be really rare, but some bug caused them to drop in
Sebilis and off some bigger monsters like Lodizal.

Maybe VI has put in a caster's equivalent to better melee upgrades in the
form of upgraded current spells, but really hard to get so you can do with
the smaller versions till then (like melee weapons, use a decent one to kill
stuff for a good one, etc)

If they do it right they make the scrolls "no drop" as well. That should put
some more excitement in the game: wanna have Burnout V? Kill the Overfiend a
couple of times.
