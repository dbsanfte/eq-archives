I've read many faqs where flaming is mentioned.... mostly in 'nice'
groups (of which I rarely frequent).

Of course I know that /all/ non-moderated newsgroups (this is not
restricted to alt.*) cannot have /official/ FAQs, since what would
stop another 'regular' from writing their own competing FAQ, and
having equal claim to its validity.  I consider myself an expert on
alt.* newsgroup creation, having lurked and posted in a.c for several
years.

'Sides, you guys brought up FAQs, not I ;).
