These books were what D&D was based upon. Gary and Company saw that a sword
wielding wizard would make the wizard way to powerful and toned him down a

The Halfling/hobbits were from this book and copied for D&D also.
I do encourage you to read the books, much better than the movie, be
prepared for a long read though.
