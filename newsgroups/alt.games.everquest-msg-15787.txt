Problem is 2 fold ,
1) her healing power is weak
2) your dmg output vs. mobs output isnt that good nither

you might have a hard time finding mobs that are in range and easy too
kill...you can try OT(overthere) but watch out for what mobs you pull ( just
pull berzerkers, tigresess and thorned). How ever what I would really
suggest is to find one of the following to group with. But only one extra
member , that should allow you to dispose with mobs much quicker and make up
for the extra player

Necro Darkness/fear + pet + dot and mez in a crunch
Druid snare + (clerics for all druid for pets) fear + dots + heal and buffs
Rouge  for Extra dmg
Shamy Slow down, buffs, pet (extra dmg) , dots and emergency heals
