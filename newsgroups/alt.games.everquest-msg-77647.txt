    A followup to the "where'd you get this" question:

17.topic

    I don't feel comfortable with that formula - to me, it predicts a
much-lower mana ragen rate for sub-50's characters than I thought - but I do
note the top predicted mana regen rate is 25-26, which I assume the author
of the formula used as one of his data points. I've also seen the 26 figure
repeated in articles talking about med rate on horseback, but was unable to
find such an article on the front page (of course I'm lazy, I'm a CLR - we
sit all day!)
