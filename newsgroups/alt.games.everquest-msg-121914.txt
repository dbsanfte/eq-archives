Well, a friend asked me to raise my smithing skill up to help on
that portion of POTC.  OK, I'm at 136, the result of a day's
work back when I was young.  At the time, I had a lamentably
low wisdom and once I got beyond the pots and pans stage,
I rapidly realized that the skill ups per PP spent weren't going
to work out.  I dropped the whole thing thinking perhaps I'd
take it up later when my wisdom was higher... but I never
did because frankly drop armor is just better in almost
every regard.  Now there's some player made stuff that
-would- be nice, but I didn't have that carrot in front  of
me when it was really interesting.

OK, well having done smithing to 186 on a previous account,
I knew that getting to 175 would be a simple matter of
throwing some cash in and spending an evening doing banded
while fending off exp group requests.  From there there would
be some annoying work collecting leather padding, maybe an
alt who was getting exp off the mobs would be in order...

But NO.  Since the most recent patch, trivials on smithing have
been dropped down significantly.  Suddenly the highest trivial
on banded is 115, far below my current skill.  I'm looking at
some Ornate Chain just to get up to 175 (expensive types, too,
ranging up to where spending 100 pp on a platinum bar per
attempt will be necessary) and then FS plate, which isn't going
to go much higher, the high end of -that- is 188 for the BP.

Armor over and above FS plate looks like cultural (nightmare
getting temper ingrediants, one reason my original smith never
managed to make any cultural at all) or Acrylia, which seems
to drop rarely at best, off green to me mobs of course.

At any rate, purpose of this post.  Help me hash out a plan
to raise smithing with as little expenditure of massive cash
and of green killing time as possible.  I'll spend more to
avoid too much greenies, I'll kill to avoid too massive a
cost layout... somewhere in there is a sweet spot route.

Would help if we had all the new trivials nailed down of course,
is there a source other than EQ traders?
