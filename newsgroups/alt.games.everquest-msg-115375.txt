That the biggest bunch of bull I ever heard.

And only true IF EQ was a single person single computer game.

It is NOT.

Ebayed characters cause many OTHER players great hardship and time exp and
loot lost.

I'd pay an extra buck a month JUST to have a SWAT Banning team do research
verify and Perma Ban Accounts Owners and any carrds linked to the buyer and
seller of accounts.

It is not HIS character HIS business. OTHER players got that toon to that
level. OTHER players depend on competence.

/em has seen 1 too many decide to goto EBAy instead of buy the game and play
it.
