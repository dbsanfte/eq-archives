If you play games, you "MUST" be prepared to upgrade. 

Games are the #1 driving force behind the ever increasing power of
PCs.

As a community EQ players have had it EXTREMELY easy up until now.

FPS players (Quake, UT, Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Return to Castle
Wolfenstien, etc) have had to upgrade several times over the last 2+
years (the life of EQ), as each new game demands better CPUs, more
RAM, and better Video Cards.

New games like DAOC do not support or run poorly on older 3dfx cards
(Voodoo Banshee, VD2, VD3). These cards were good when new, but now
they are dinosaurs.

If you ONLY play EQ ( and from the complaints in this forum there are
a lot of you), you should be glad that you have been able to run EQ
for 2+ years without needing a major hardware upgrade until now. The
average gamer upgrades at least once and purchases 3-7 boxed games at
$30-50USD a pop over a 12 month period.

It's not Verant's fault that technology has passed some of you by. As
games improve the hardware demands will go up. That is an unavoidable
fact. 

If you are running anything "LESS" than the following, you are due for
an upgrade if you play games.

PIII-500mhz or AMD Athlon 500mhz
128mb PC66/100/133 SDRAM (not enough for EQ:SoL)
32mb AGP Video Card (ATI or Nvidia based)
10gb Harddrive
Win98, Win98SE, WinME, Win2K, WinXP

If you want to "play" you have to be willing to pay the price of
admission.

Good Luck, and Happy Gaming!
