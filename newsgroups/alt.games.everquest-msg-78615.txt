Str is fairly dubious in how much it actually helps you skill up. I'd
not do reckless str anyway for the reason you state, instead my cleric
did yaulp then later yaulp two. When comparing when I did yaulp and
did not do yaulp I stopped though, it did not seem to help much.

Oh, thats right, if you do stacks of the RIGHT items it does make the
thing.. eating up the extras. I've never had that happen because I'm
Anal and keep the ctrl button held down the whole time.. look to make
sure each item is one, etc.

FYI, according to the tradeskills guy, nothing helps your actual
success but your skill. Str and the higher of either Wis or Int only
affect your chance at skillups.

http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm61.showMessage?topicID=3.topic

"INT & WIS: whichever of the two is higher will affect skill increases
when practicing ALL tradeskills. The higher either your INT or WIS is,
the greater the chance you have for a skill gain while tradeskilling.

STR: higher strength will give you an added bonus to your chance at
gaining skill increases while smithing. 

D EX: higher dexterity will give you an added bonus to your chance at
gaining skill increases while fletching or tailoring.

CHA: higher charisma, along with faction, will affect your buying and
selling prices with merchants.

Stats have no impact on your chance of success or failure when
practicing tradeskills. (Only your current skill is supposed to impact
your chances of success or failure when creating an item.)"


Of course due to the nature of the random number generator people
always feel that buffing something really does help them with success
to the point where one enchanter I knew swore that buffing charisma
helped her with jewelry success. I imagine if there was a key in EQ to
make you stand on your head, some tradeskill person would swear they
had more successes while doing that and we all should.

They may at some future time, who knows. The thing is you are kind of
responsible yourself and as I said above its never happened to me once
and is not that hard to stop. As I said I ALWAYS have ctrl held down
when making anything.. the entire time. They've already added several
shortcuts and safeguards, I mean.. just how much hand holding do we
expect? Compared to the old ways its improved tons.
