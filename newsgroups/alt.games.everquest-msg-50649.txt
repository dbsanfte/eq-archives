I have an MX300 sound card (aureal), and at some point the reverb has
stopped working.
When playing with sound settings, or when I type /reverb the info that is
displayed in the chat windows claims that the card has no reverb support.

I sure that it has worked in the past..

I'm using the 2048 ref. drivers, and have installed the a3d 2.0 update as
well.
Have tried re-installing drivbers and DirectX 8.0a.

I'm running Win98 SE (upgraded from win95).
Both Kunark and Veilious installed.
4.1 speaker set-up.

Anyone have any thoughts as to what the problem might be ?

Thanks
