What an interesting dodge.  The old "My friend was PLing me" song-and-dance.
It seems that this contradicts your previous statement, which went something
like this:

<cutandpaste>
2) where was I supposed to go with the group of aggro'in deepwater crocs
and mummies?  The middle of the desert?  uhhh, no.  I'm gonna go to the
dock,
where everybody sits so I can get some help.
</cutandpaste>

Even if your reply is true and a friend ~was~ PLing you, your initial
statement speaks volumes.  Particularly the "where everybody sits so I can
get some help" aspect.  What happened to your omnipotent friend?
Furthermore, even if there really was a friend, what happens when he/she
isn't around?  I believe I can answer this one:

Moron shouts "%T to docks. Plz help!!!!!!"

> now if you'll excuse me, I have children to tend to.

... and act like.

> /condescending tone

Given the current example of you gaming style, you have very little to be
condescending about.  However, I do give you extra credit for spelling
'condescending' correctly.
