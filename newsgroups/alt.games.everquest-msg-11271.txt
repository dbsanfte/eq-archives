Warriors are the "best tanks", period.  If that's all you're shooting
for, start a Warrior.

HOWEVER, there's a lot more to actually enjoying your character
than simply being able to lay claim to being "best tank".

Shadow Knights and Paladins are second-best tanks behind Warriors
(yet still quite effective at tanking), but they have a lot else
going for them that makes them well worth playing even though they
can't say that they are "best tanks".

Personally, I love my 51 Paladin and couldn't stand the thought
of playing a Warrior.  Paladins are more versatile, more "interesting"
in that they have more tools to work with, and there's a lot
more strategy involved in playing them well.

And Rangers and Monks and Rogues have a lot of really fun, unique
abilities that make them a blast to play too.

So it all comes down to your personal preferences about what
you would enjoy playing, and how.
