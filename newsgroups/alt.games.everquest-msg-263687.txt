I hope you're not suggesting that I deliberately set up this scenario 
because I like seeing people like Annie and Julie go at it. Do me a favor 
please and clarify your comment because the way I'm reading it, that's the 
implication I get and I find it insulting and disappointing coming from you. 
Alt.games.everquest and comp.sys.ibm.pc.game.rpg are two of my favorite 
newsgroups with many of my favorite regulars and I enjoy dialoging with 
residents of both, particularly when I know that the matter under discussion 
is a subject of interest to both. I may have facilitated the clash here 
through my cross-posting, but I sure as hell didn't intend it and I'm hoping 
that I'm just mis-reading your suggestion to the contrary.
