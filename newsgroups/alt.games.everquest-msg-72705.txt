I don't know the name of the quest.  I'm playing a human paladin, LVL 8.  It was late last night and I wasn't paying real close
attention.  I went back and read what was said and I didn't see anything that instructed me to do anything specific.  This is what I
did up to this point-

Killed Squire Narls.
Gave Altunic Jarden (sp?) a shirt.  He gave me a token of generosity.
Killed a Desert Tarantula
Gave the venom sack to the guy out behind the Hall of Truth and got the Token of Bravery
I gave him both tokens.  He told me to go kill someone in the sewer.
I killed the person in the sewer and I got a token from that person.
I gave him the token and got some experience and one gold piece.

I thought - Lame, one gold piece.  Then I looked at my inventory and I have this Testimony.  I didn't pick it up from the guard I
killed.  I looked at the dialogue, the trainer guy didn't say he gave me the testimony, and he didn't tell me what to do with it.

What do I do with this testimony?
