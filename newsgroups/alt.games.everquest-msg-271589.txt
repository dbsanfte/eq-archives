The game is essentially the same. Probably a bit harder due to the
relative dearth of new low-level newbies (low-levels not being PLed by
alts) so grouping in some favorite zones is probably affected to some
extent. During prime time it is probably not bad though you may find
significant changes in guilds and where people are.

On Veeshan, my primary server, I have noted that the bazaar hosts about
40 to 60 percent of the maximum number of traders.
