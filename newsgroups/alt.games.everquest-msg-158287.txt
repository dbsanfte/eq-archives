Tenuously related  story.

So, I was gonna wait a bit on PoP, but being the little crackwhore I
am I go down Wednesday and pick it up.

I grab my copy and sashay to the counter to pay for it.  When I plop
it down the kind lady behind the counter looks at me and says "Just
one?"

Apparently most people had been buying multiple copies.  She said one
poor soul actually bought SIX copies at once.

I had also been lucky in that they had gotten a new shipment the very
day I had stopped in and they had been sold out pretty much constantly
since release.

Take that as you will.
