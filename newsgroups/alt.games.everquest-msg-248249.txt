And I hate it. :) So it comes down to different ways of mezzing I guess.
A guildie enchanter is or better was using aoe mezz for nearly
everything. But it will get a bit rough when mobs aren't in level range
of this spell anymore. But I do see your point.

Personally I had 2 color stuns loaded just for this. When swarmed by
mobs - there's no point using color stun with just 3 mobs in camp already
beating on the maintank - I stunned them mezzed one stunned with second
color stun again mezzed next ... This really works nice and I have a
mezz chain running where I can sit down and refresh mezzes as needed.
Of course this strategy was pointless when mobs were over lvl55 as most
of them were stun immune. :/

Hm speaking as a raid leader for my guild I've never even considered aoe on
a pull. Maybe I should give it a try when clearing pofear next time. Of
course not unless both death touching golems are down. ;)
