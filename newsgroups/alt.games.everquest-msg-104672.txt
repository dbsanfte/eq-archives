Greetings to everyone

I am posting in a request i am Technomancer 47th paladin
i am an aussie and play later if there are fellow aussies who play on
Storm hammer or usually play late. I will be organising raids on a regular
basis i have about 23 names on a list for peoples but would like it
if people who email me or else join our chat chan "lateshow".

The first raid i will be planning will be for City of Mist. something easy
for everyone to get to know each other

Cheers Techno
