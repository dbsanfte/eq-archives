It's about time too. It needs to go live soon but they can wait till I hit
54 with my Druid (which should be shortly after the time I stop listening to
my Friends on suggestions of hunting locations)
Now we should campaign for Pets similar to Necro's, the ability to wear
chain and Dual Wield as well.

CH would be great for my Druid, now can my Enchanter have some decent Nukes
or Dots? ooh and monks Flying Kick and Feign Death for my Warrior, k thx.

Next week, Clarity spells for Shaman.
