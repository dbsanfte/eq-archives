    Depends on the circumstances of the hunt. Outdoors, you'd likely want
that shaman. Indoors, I'd want a cleric.

    Last time I checked Superior Healing was never resisted. Superior
Healing also saves people during an overpull, when control is being
established. Shaman slows do not save lives.

    Agreed. Slowing is one of the most powerful tactics in the game, and XP
grind groups without access to it will be severely hampered. But it doesn't
replace proper cleric healing, because the two are used for different
things.

    Slows are the damage mitigation equivalent of DoTs: over time, a slow is
a far more efficient form of damage mitigation than a heal. Slows suffer the
same issues as DoTs do compared with nukes: if you need something done NOW,
you don't go with the "over time" solution. If the mob has to die NOW, you
nuke, you don't DoT. If someone needs healing NOW - bad aggro / lag issues /
uncontrolled mobs - slow just won't cut it. At 34, the cleric's "fast heal"
GHeal is easier to cast for the cleric AND heals more damage than the best
shaman heal. Clerics save lives. Shamans improve effiency.

    There's other issues, of course. Outdoors, as I mentioned you'd likely
want the shaman because SoW is one of the best forms of emergency damage
prevention - just run away. Indoors, not only can a cleric protect you from
the unexpected better when in camp, but the puller is better off with cleric
buffs than with shaman buffs in terms of "Lord, let me survive this overpull
until I'm healed/zone". But as a general rule, if I think that ANYTHING
unexpected could occur, I go cleric over shaman if forced to choose.
