Let me see if I understand the hell level phenomena.
basic xp needed to get out of a level 
is R*M*(Lvl^3*1000)for a human cleric
WHERE
R = race penalty (1.2 for trolls? 1 for humans)
M = the modifier,starts at one, and increments in hell levels.

Now, at certain levels, M increments with the net result
that you have to retroactively earn the increment times
all the XP from the preceding levels.  If M increments from
1 to 1.1 at 30 (made up numbers) then to get out of 30 there
is a penalty of 30^3*R*(.1) in addition to the rest.

Is this correct?  Something I'm missing?  So, could you get
rid of the penalty the same way hybrid penalties were done,
by multiplying the XP gained by some modifier so that you were
given the penalty XP free?

so, made up numbers (again)
Human Cleric
before 30 M = 1.
xp to get to 30 = (29^3)*1000.  (24,389,000)
M increments to 1.1 at 30
xp to get out of 30 (30^3)*1000*1.1 (29,700,000)

XP to get from 30 to 31 (5,311,000)
Penalty as a result of Modifier increase .1 * 24,389,000,
or (2,438,900).

Appropriate XP to get from 30 to 31 5,311,000 - 2,438,900 = 
(2,872,100)

2,438,900 / 2,872,100 = .849 (~.85)

So, if for every kill a person made in 30, he got an additional
85% xp, he would leve through the hell level at a pace consistent
with the other levels, without changing anyone's accumulated XP?

Of course, you can't do this to 54/59 as that would cause huge 
problems with AA xp.
