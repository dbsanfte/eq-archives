You're welcome in advance :-)

If you're planning on sticking to the Qeynos area, your two best bets for
spider silk would be in either the Qeynos Aquaducts or on Wisp Isle in
Erud's Crossing.  If you're after SpiderLING silk, try in Everfrost.

The bigger spiders in the Tundra area of Everfrost will sometimes drop silk,
but it is frustratingly rare.  If you hunt the spiders in the QAquaducts, it
is a bit more rewarding, but watch out for the occasional undead (zombies,
and once in a blue moon, spectres).  Don't know if some of your druid spells
will work in the Aquaducts or not.  Get a decent map, and avoid any areas
near the Bloodsabers' hideout.

If you hunt the spiders on Wisp Isle, take a good sized, well-ballanced
group.  The island is small, the spiders group, and their venom is nasty for
critters their level.  Make sure the padre in the group has Cure Poison
memmed, and that he knows how to use it (sometimes requires multiple
castings to cure).  Do not attack any of the beetles there, or you not only
lose faction with the local Cat Folk, but you also might cause an Island
Madman and/or fire elementals to spawn.  If you see a fire elemental on that
Island, common wisdom is to Gate *immediately* or prepare for a corpse run.

The spiders in West Karana, last I bothered to kill any of them, never ever
drop any silk.
