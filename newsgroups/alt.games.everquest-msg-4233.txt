This was happening to me for a while. Nothing to do with ICS, that works
fine. I found that the problem was that I'd changed the hardware
acceleration level for my soundcard down to 'None' to get Black & White to
work. When I put the acceleration back to 'Full', no more crashes on zoning.
Very strange bug, but I can reproduce it whenever I want. I have no idea why
hardware acceleration should only cause crashes on zoning!
