Most peoples gripe with monks pulling is it takes too long.  Yes, speed does
factor into the equation of "who's a better puller"

Doesn't matter that for 2 hours pulling a constant script monks might
perform better than an SK (less downtime from 1: mana 2: death for reasons
above)..

I said if theres 2 mobs stood together, and you want those mobs turned into
1, SK snare/feign/pull is faster than anything a monk can do.  Its that
simple, and its true from velious to fennin ro to PoTime trials.

Doesn't matter if we have more survivability, faster fd or whatever, the
simple fact is snare and pacify is faster than anything a monk can do.

Ive pulled every raid target from trak/VP to potime/quarm, main puller for
my guild every raid, highest attendence monk bla bla, so I wouldn't really
class myself as a shitty monk, but anyway...

Simple example.. HoH shrine, the 2 guards outside each room.  Lets see what
my pulling options are..
Agro both, hope that 1 walks home and resets before the other does.. depends
entirely on the mob, sometimes the split happens first time for 5 pulls..
sometimes it takes 5 tries for 1 split
Bio orb to blind.. lets hope it lands in the first place, lets hope he runs
the right way, lets hope the blind duration is long enough for the other mob
to have gone home
Sure theres other little tricks you can try.. but the principle is the
same.. sometimes it works straight off, sometimes you have to keep working

Lets compare that to a bard, ranger, cleric, enchanter...
Target mob1 /cast pacify(lull)
Target mob2 /pull
Time: about 3 seconds

A necro/SK -
Snare mob1, fd, when mob2 resets the snared mob will still be stood out of
place, solo pullable
Time: not long at all

Xuzl... I've split the 4 guards using FD and its time consuming if the mobs
don't respond nicely for you. I've stood with an SK snare/fd and seen every
mob split inside 10 seconds.

I've pulled PoE rings and used whatever tricks I needed to split the later
waves.. of course it works, i do it day in day out in various zones.. I've
also been with an SK to tag his snares, and seen splits in a fraction of the
time because the random element is taken out. No more hoping for certain
pathing, certain mobs to reset first, etc etc, just snare mob, let other
reset, pull snared mob.

"> you're getting outpulled by SKs on more than a few specific splits where

The point is, *almost* every encounter has snarable mobs to trivialise the
splits though.
I guess im a bit stubborn. I like to do things alone and not depend on
another class to snare-aid my split.. so I do do it the long hard way, but
im not blind to the fact snare completly trivialises it
