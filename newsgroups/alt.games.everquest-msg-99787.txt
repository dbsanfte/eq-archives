Sigh.  Here we go again.  Yes, they have:

   "We don't plan on releasing detailed mechanics - Some
   things people should really discover for themselves
   as part of normal gameplay. The goal was to smooth
   the path from 30 to 50, not to make it require less
   overall gameplay, or happen faster. The intent wasn't
   to get people from 30 to 50 any faster. 

   "The overall path isn't any easier to reach level 50 -- a
   retroactive experience boost wouldn't really be called
   for. Down the line of what I said at the last fan
   faire, "If we did something with hell levels, we
   would have to find a fair solution that didn't affect
   anyone's existing experience or progress."

   "We found that solution."

People keep claiming this, but I have yet to see anyone
actually quote them to that effect.  Why don't you
give it a try?
