Hi,

With the recent changes for levels 1-10 I was reminded of a guild event
that I saw posted about here (I'm sure that someone can find the URL).
The guild assembled about 50 level 1 chars and got them bound at the
Gfay / crushbone zone line, and then attempted to "rush" crushbone.

With the new changes this type of event could be very funny.

Get together as many level 1 melee* types as possible.
Bind then at the zone line.
Everyone charge in.
See what happens first.

Do they manage to clear the zone ?
Do people manage to reach level 11 ?
How many deep red orcs does it take to get to level 2 ?

To add spice you could set chalanges :

First character to reach level 10
First caracter to kill Lord Crush / Divin
Frist to get that shield that I can't remember the name of.

Award players with play or items.

This could be a seriously funny event / effect of the rule changes.

*Melee since people will not need to run off and get spells.
No one will need healing (lol) and they can pick up equipment on the
way.

Of course we would have to warn everyone else first.
The main problem I see would be getting all those level ones to the zone
line alive <G>

Thoughts ?

Jim
