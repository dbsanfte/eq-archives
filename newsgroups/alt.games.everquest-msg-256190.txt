Apparently you don't understand the term softcap in this context.

Monks have a "hard" softcap.  At around 1350 AC, monks get approximately 1
actual AC's worth of benefit per every 40 displayed AC.  Monks are the only
class that is capped like this.  At 1800 AC, I have the same practical AC as
a under-1400 AC ranger.  My better avoidance skills make up for this
somewhat, but at my level the rangers have enough AC to make up in
mitigation what they lack in avoidance, have just as many hitpoints as I do,
*and* don't take damage with the "streakiness" that I do.

This has nothing to do with the per-mob/expansion softcaps that are often
discussed, such as you can only tank so effectively per mob/expansion and AC
won't help you above that (considering in GoD that is 2k+, it's not much of
a factor anymore anyway).  Though actually, in GoD I find I tank a little
bit better than rangers, because they haven't *yet* "softcapped" for the
expansion and I still avoid hits like I always did (again, totally unrelated
to the "hard" softcap on monks discussed above).

I'll be glad to give you the links for the parses that show this to be the
case for monks.  But as they've been posted here before...  you first.  =P

I prefer to believe the proven, parsed results, combined with personal
experience that supports same.
