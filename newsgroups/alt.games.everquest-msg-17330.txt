Silk Swatches make good money because tailors are using them to skill up on
Wu's Monk Armor, which sells to monks at anywhere from 30pp to 200pp per
piece.  You can also sell the occational High Quality Bear skin for up to
30pp, although I'm not sure theres much of a demand for this now adays.  The
nice thing about Silk Swatches is that they dont fail when combined and you
can work tailoring up to 15 without putting a single skill point into it.
