I hate MS, personally.  When Iron Oxide was worth something, loot was just
OK.  Then, with the addition of LoY dyes, the value on it dropped through
the floor, so maybe a few HQ or better hopper hides, some words and a (very)
few gems.  While exp is ok (not great, or even good), the loot just will not
help with spells or equipment upgrades.  Much better is SoL A and or UGuk at
that level.  Better loot and killing goblins or frogloks is more fun, and
challenging.  Not to mention the exp is better, especially when in a good
group.
