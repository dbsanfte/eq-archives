Actually it wouldn't be that hard to find this mob if you had the
desire.  All you do is wait until it spawns, or get lucky and find it
up, during a time when no one else is killing anything.  Make sure
nothing has been killed in the last 20 minutes (or whatever the zone
spawn time is) before killing Eldrig.  Now wait 20 minutes with a
Ranger or Druid and see what pops after the alotted time.  Also the
fact that Eldrig spawns near the OT zone (I think it was?) make it that
much more likely that someone would see it spawn since that is a
popular place to set up camp anyway.

I know, that would take a lot of time, but then lots of free time and a
will to do something long and boring are characteristics that many EQ
players seem to have...
