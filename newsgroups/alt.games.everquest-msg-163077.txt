I've been doing that since EQAtlas (online site) started up.

I have, essentially, a large 3-ring binder that contains EQAtlas.com in
it. Tabbed, color coded, and laid out by zone connection (Mostly, make
that most common zone connections).

Since it was laid out in Word format, I have given my current copy to
friends on request. Printed double sided it's only a few hundred pages.
I suggest printing it at work on the color laserejet.... ;-)

no, you can't have one. Unless you contact me on Karanas (Sinnamon is my
current primary played, Bludstain is second, and ultimately it's wearer)
and give me a Fungi Tunic. Then I'll change my mind....
