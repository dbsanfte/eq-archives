I don't think the Bazaar disconnects are related to bandwidth at all, but I
have no problem believing that some (not all, sometimes people crash,
getting to that in a sec) are related to the 500 trader limit and the
problems it would cause if 500 stable connection/computer people set up shop
and effectively locked anyone else out of setting up a trader under the
server resets.

At the same time, I do think that the new compression scheme they are using
is causing various problems, including likely causing some people to crash. 
I know I've experienced some "weirdness" that seems to be related to
whatever they are doing to network traffic.
