In my experience, general practice has usually been that if no one is
alive at the camp, then it's up for grabs even if it is obvious that a
group recently wiped. While it's not a *nice* practice, it tends to be
the rule a lot of people follow. Most you can do is tell them they're
jerks, put them on your don't group with/rez/whatever list, and move
on.
