A friend successfully restarted after about 20months away although that
was a while ago. Another briefly reactivated an account after 12 months
away to hand stuff over and it was all there. If you look through the
google archive for this group you should find reports from other posters
to age in the same vein.

With the steady expansion of the game and the steady expansion in hard
disk size available its probably gonna cost them more to search thru for
inactive accounts and delete them or write the code to do it than it is
to simply bung a new bunch of Hard disk space in...plus as the servers get
added to and upgraded (a server consisting of a great bunch of mahines)
there is ever more space to store the basic datafiles - you got what,
200-250 numbers for each character if all slots are full and the full
range of skills attained - in hex thats a 3 digit number for most things
like skills, 2 digit for some and 4 for others...so 750 ASCII characters
to store so call it 1k per character, most people will play on one server
or 2, call it 6 characters per account average - be generous 10k per
player average - 400,000 players or so (call it half a mill
registered)....thats one 4 gig hard disk....compared to 2-3 zones per
machine in the server chain or something....we are talking trivials....
