Just a warning (like its really going to matter). What ever you do,
don't deal with a human, named ROLALDAR.

He is a newbie that I offered a chance to make some plat to easily. He
agreed to hold three bags for me and then ran like a little chicken. I
caught him online later, and he refused to give them back.

BEWARE ROLALDAR
