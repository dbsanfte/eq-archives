For the last two years I've written forty one short stories based on my 
Everquest character, Loral Ciriclight.  It started as a way to relate 
the stories of my adventures through roleplaying but has served to help 
me enjoy the game that much more.  Some of the stories are frankly 
embarrassing but some I very much enjoy even a year after writing it.

It occurred to me that these stories might be enjoyed by the 
alt.games.everquest folks and that Usenet would be a good way to 
preserve these stories should the website where I host them ever go down.

I just posted the first five chapters of a current forty one chapters 
that exist.  I would like to publish all forty one if the general 
alt.games.everquest community didn't feel that I was spamming the 
message boards with information that some may feel isn't relevant to the 
game itself.

The five stories I sent were my first five.  They aren't very good, but 
the stories get consistently better as they go.  Hopefully I do not 
receive too much negative feedback for posting them here, but if people 
do feel it is inappropriate, please let me know.

Thank you,

Loral Ciriclight
65th Cleric of Tunare
Healers United, Quellious
