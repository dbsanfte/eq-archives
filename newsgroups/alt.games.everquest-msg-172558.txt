I have a 250 JC jeweler.  I made alot of silver items for people.  the
bazaar doesn't really lend itself to how I did it.  I would always wait to
make jewelry until I had a request, never making items I didn't have an
order for unless I was trying for skill ups.    At your skill level I would
think that electrum jaded bracelets would be your big money maker.  if you
can make gold ( which you probably are just out of the skill range to
make ), gold jaded bracelets are even better.  My Jewelering for others is
pretty much dead, I don't really do it any more.  As far as I'm concerned
the market for doing it has dropped out, whether that is true or not is
another matter.  I can make more money casting c3 in an hour than I can
running around doing jeweler crafting, so its not cost effective.
