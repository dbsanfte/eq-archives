Slow is far more important than buffer/debuffer in general.  Slowing does 
stand on it's own quite well.  All the slow capable classes have other 
utility as well.  Not having some type of slower in a group generally 
makes a huge difference as to what that group can tackle, much like not 
having a tank, or CC, or healing, or DPS.

They are?  Had not noticed any such trend.  We have too many in our guild 
as it is, and I rarely have any trouble finding a group.

For all but the toughest raid targets, SKs and Paladins are used 
interchangably with warriors.  Often, the knight classes are preferred 
for their instant ability to lock down agro (assuming a halfway competent 
player of course).
