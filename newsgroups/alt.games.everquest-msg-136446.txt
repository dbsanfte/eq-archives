Well, he can't reply with examples to back himself up, which would be
evidence for the validity of his side of the arguement. All he has really
said so far are comments like "You're so wrong"

What is your point here? I know it's well covered in the USA.

Who said anything about military losses? America couldn't win the war so
they had to bail out. Both times. I also would use military death
statistics, America loves carpet bombing villages of innocent people...

I didn't say "Every black American hates to be called African American", I
said I know black Americans that hate it.

Ok, I dare say. As interesting as this is, I don't see the point of ranting
about it when I simply stated that African American is a bit racist. I do
know people that find it offensive. Some black people use the 'n' word as a
reference to other black people but it doesn't mean it's not racist.

Because I have a difference of opininon? I live in a capitalist country
which, if I listened to propaganda, would be in favour of the USA. Doubt all
you like.
