Yes, they both will get skill checks.

They both will go up.  The secondary hand will lag, however,
since it has to pass the dual wield check to swing.  It
doesn't swing as often so it doesn't get as many chances to
raise skill.  I put my best weapon (a 1hb) in primary and
a h2h weapon in secondary right after leveling, then swap
out the 1hb after it's maxxed for the level for another h2h
so I can quickly max h2h.  Then I swap in a 2hb until it's
maxxed.  And then fight with my best weapons (which happen
to both be 1hb) until I level again.

I've been able to keep all three maxxed out until I hit 34
when my twink power ran out.  My 2hb weapon is the "Stick
of Self-Death" and my wife just hates it when it procs... :(
(Adamantite Bo Stick, procs a rain spell that hits me for
about 47 up to three times when it procs.  Nothing quite like
having 300 HPs and getting hit by your own proc and the mob
at the same time...  Ack!!)

Hrmm, good question.  My monk has maxxed all his weapon skills
each level so it's hard to say.  I *believe* that, since the
two weapons are totally unrelated, that checks will go per normal
although your shown ATK rating reflects only the primary.
You should be able to get a definitive answer from someone who
let either H2H or 1hb lag, though.

I always keep the one I want to raise (first) in the primary
hand since it doesn't have to pass the dual weild check and
therefore swings more often, giving more chances for skill
increases.  I haven't noticed any major difference between
the two, though, since I've pretty much kept mine maxxed
since the newbie levels.

Weapon speed for the secondary is unrelated to your primary.
The secondary weapon gets a dual wield check to see if it will
swing whenever the weapon's delay cycles.  So, if you were
using an 8/20 in the secondary, it will check every two
seconds (assuming no haste) against dual wield to see if it
swings.  If it does, it then goes through the normal attack
logic.  And it will check every two seconds if you have a
primary delay of 40 or a primary delay of 16.

All this (and MORE!) are answered at www.monkly-business.com,
BTW, in the forums.
