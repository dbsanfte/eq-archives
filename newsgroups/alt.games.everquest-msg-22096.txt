I doubt this, because the level limits were the same under the old XP
system, and under the old XP system, where your share of XP was
proportional to your current XP, rather than your current level, that
level 10 would have gotten very little XP if allowed to group with a
level 40.

This is probably the "real" reason for the level limits.
