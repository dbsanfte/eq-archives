It's easier with Ill:DE, but not required. Strip naked for a dry run. Bind
in Freeport, and run to Ogguk. Invis when you get into the swamp and run
up to the guards and target one. Then run -far- away keeping the guard
targeted. Drop invis. If they're "dubious" or better, you're in
business. If not, wait for Ill:DE to do the rest of the run.

Here's why doing it at 8 is entirely possible: Alliance. If the guards are
dubious, grab your barkeeps compendium, invis up for the trip through
Ogguk, and find Clurg. Once in his tavern, have Alliance ready to go. When
you enter the room, just to be safe, back into the farthest corner you can
get to (have Gate ready) target Clurg, drop invis and immediately /con. If
still dubious you can relax, you're not going to die. (Con the other two
in the room, the bouncer and the female ogre, can't remember her name)

Anyway, walk on up to Clurg, cast Alliance, and that should put you to
Indifferent or better. If you've got Indiff, turn in your items, and
admire your shiney new mug.
