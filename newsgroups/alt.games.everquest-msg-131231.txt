For large values of 'about'. :)  My translation is close to literal, 
depending on the source there could be idiomatic connotations that change 
the meaning.

Heheh.  Babelfish gives us, "Badly is him, which finds badly there".

Yeah, that 'there' is a lot closer.  And finds, not seeks, duh.  "Evil is 
he, who finds evil there."

Which Babelfish then translates back as.. "le mal est lui, qui trouve le 
mal la".  Heheh, ok, stop me before I switch it to chinese and back. :)

I guess the main thing I was trying to say was, there's no part of it that 
says 'the evil was not in the thing'.  Unless that becomes clear from the 
original context somehow from what 'y' refers to.
