Any more than Windows98 machines are the platform of choice for serious
digital artists (or hammers are the platform of choice for driving
screws.) Pick the right tool for the job.

Generally, by installing VirtualPC, finding out that isn't going to do
it, and then breaking down and buying a Window machine. S'what I did,
anyway.

Some, possibly, just not enough compared to other things they might be
doing instead. See other comments in this thread.

Many, if not most, of the best selling games for Windows eventually work
their way onto the Mac platform. Blizzard made a nice profit on Diablo
II for Mac, for instance.

Well, do, just be prepared to hold it for a very loooong time. :-)

It happens, usually when all the juice has been wrung from the Windows
side (Balder's Gate, Unreal, Vampire, et al). Some companies,
particularly Blizzard and Bungie are still doing parallel development on
their "big games" for both platforms (Diablo, Oni, Halo, etc.) - it
seems to be more a matter of the developer's choice of Windows-only APIs
(DirectX, for instance) rather than any inherent advantage of the Wintel
architecture. My dual G4/Radeon Mac runs rings around my Wintel/Radeon
setup in both game framerates in Unreal or Quake, and benchmarks like
Photoshop operations.
