You could try your DC and runn for the zone if it fails.  Otherwise try
looking here http://www.eqlinks.com/ for chanter specific boards and there
you will either find a guide to dire charming or you could look through the
forums.  If they are anything like as good as the bard forums you will
likely find a stickied post with DC'able mobs by zone.
