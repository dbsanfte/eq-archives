Actually, I use my pet a lot as a druid:-

        Farming mobs, especially spiderlings etc that are too fiddly to
bother with spells (you can set up a hotkey to target/kill as you run
along).

        Killing mobs for faction (buff a low level guy, who runs around the
dungeon gathering mobs... heal if they get low, quake when the guy gets
near, anything which surivives or runs after touching your ds will be
cleaned up by the bear... in blackburrow i just stood about while piranhas
kamikazied themselves. I hate fighting underwater but the bear does quite
nicely).

        A sacrifice for harm touching types. Here, kill my bear. Now you
can't harm touch for another game day. Don't you feel silly?

        A guard dog against stupid training people in DSP. Sure, he dies
fast, but if I'm facing a wall of hoppers, and some_stupid_guy with sow and
a horde of shrooms on his tail runs past me, I survive better with the bear.
Of course it would be nice if he would not run to certain doom, ie by
attacking a mob I've rooted, then when i tell him to calm down, he see-saws
because as he turns to leave it alone, the mobs hits him. But I've grouped
with players like that, so you can't say he's doing too badly.

Besides, he's good for dealing with those hidden mobs. He sniffs them out
and points their way. Million household uses!
