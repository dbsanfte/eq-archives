Yes use a Runed toem staff which is 2HB and quite easy to attain with a
little work.
If you have an item in your off hand use a giant snake fang.

The wizards weapon skills are
1HB
2HB
Peircing

Later on as your wizard levels you will need you off hand to carry + int
items, so I suggest practicing either 1hb or peircing.
Personally I used a giant snake fang till I aquired a Walrus tooth which I
put to good use until level 20
