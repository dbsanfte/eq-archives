The only ones from SOE are the newbie zones and the cities.  Mapfiend maps
are player generated and do get replaced perodically as they get updated.
Also, you can update the maps, yourself, to account for changes or other
info you might want (I added spawn points for several areas and the PoK book
in Field of Bone, for example).
