Oh, noooooooooooo you don't. You're not passing this one off on the old,
ambigous, "it's unknown properites of a vast magic field" cop-out.
And the planes aren't really "alternate dimensions" either. The wizards
just tell us that to make themselves look more powerful and mysterious.
Those are just places that are harder to get to. For instance, you can
see the base of the plane of air from S. Ro.  And they don't even use
spells nor space-time rifts to get us there. They're just really fast
invisible planes like Wonder Woman has. The only spell they're casting
is a stun so you don't see the trip, and instead get a "Loading, please
wait....."
