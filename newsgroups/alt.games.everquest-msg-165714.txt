Ed. Give me an example here of a quest that requires a 12 hour block
of time to get something you want and cannot be done in smaller
chunks; and show that that sort of design is actually a fundamental
part of the game content rather than merely a small % of it catering
to the small % of zealot customers who enjoy the sense of achievement
of that sort of thing.

I, honest to god, cannot think of many, if any, things that do.
Maybe clearing POG to kill tunare. But even that requires a large
dedicated guild and , just as fear now gets cleared by one group
of bored high levellers to take a shot at cazic, I'm sure things
will develop that way too. Those who enjoy clearing go to work,
those who enjoy raiding come to help later when the 'boring' bit
is done.

My honest opinion is they're imbeciles. They're people who sit, telling
themselves how much they HATE having to do this stupid camp, for
12 hours, then delete in a fit of lunatic frustration. If you're
saying a mob only spawns, lets say, every 12 hours, that does not
mean you have to sit there for 12 hours ,or even 24, or 8, to
eventually get it. I 'camped' stormfeather by paying the newbies
hunting there for XP to drag it away when it popped and tell me to
come. I 'camped' less contested mobs by just popping in once in a
while to see if it was up for the time I had free, until it was.

It depends on what you mean. One mob spawning once every 12 hours,
compared to 12 mobs spawning once every 1 hour is what most people
mean, which increases the number of end items (say the uber sword
of flamefest slaying) by 12. Where once a day previously 2 swords
could come into the world, now 24 can. Sure, as an individual you
have to put in the same amount of work, ish, but the balance of the
game takes a shafting.

Tell you what ; be specific; tell us exactly what it is your objecting
to, and how you think it could be improved. Then I'm sure people
can either agree or disagree on the more rational grounds  you
prefer... but to be honest, you're not enunciating anything novel,
or even particularly coherent, right now. I am not sure the problem
I *think* your objecting to even exists, and I am not sure the
solution I *think* you'd countenance would work.

But then, I'm not even sure what your position really is. 'Long
camps suck,.  break them up' seems to be it and... well. Why do
they suck? And how would you break them up? How many quests are
there that actually require a single dedicated block of time?

I've been through some of the biggest timesink quests in Luclin,
regarded as the worst of the worst, and frankly, without EVER
spending a huge amount of time, because I didnt demand the
result 'now now now' it was easy and pleasant over a period
of months instead of a nightmare over a period of 48 hours.

The hope , I suspect, is that said druid will never come back to
the group again having decided what nasty people there are there.
The reason is that the childish hysteria at having a money making
scheme that is at the 'expense' of a class who could better have
made use of the quest time stymied by your own idiocy draws very
little sympathy, and indicates a mindset the consensus here is very
much against.

The 4 year olds mentality that says 'I've just spent 12 hours doing
something I hated and I didnt even get a lollipop so now I'm having
a tantrum, so I'll delete MY characters, see how you like that, VI
suxx0r' ... well. Do I need to go on?

Shrug. Usenet, like EQ, is a consensus community in which the only
power is that of the mob; or community, depending on which side of
that particular consensus you're on. People police this group with
flames, as its all they have. Some are fed up with certain types,
and certain discussions. Telling them to stop posting because you
dont like what they say or how they say is just as invalid (or valid
;) ) as them telling the 'OP' not to post here any more.

If you find yourself in the minority , then it may be an indication
that you want another EQ community, be it web board or usenet group,
that has views more in line with your own. Railing against the
established views demanding they behave the way you want isnt going
to 'quell' any flame wars, it'll just get you, yourself, embroiled
in more of them.

I'd best shut up now, I suppose.
