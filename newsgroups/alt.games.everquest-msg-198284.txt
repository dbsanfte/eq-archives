Its harder because of the greening effect; while you can solo happily for AA at
60, the mobs you face become much harder to take down without a full group at
61, and more so every time you level.  If you were playing in well constructed
groups, and get flagged as appropriate, then yes, AA come faster as you level.
So this depends on play style as much as anything

One of the great unwashed, my cleric is 65 but does exp in POS/POV; an AA there
is still a couple hours work (grouped.  Solo its a lot longer, since I can only
solo the undead there, and only a few of them have the proper resists, and the
only way to tell them apart is to pull and see, and zone if I'm unlucky).  It
was also a couple hours work per AA at 61 in POD soloing flies.  If the Tier 3
zones they are going to let us into without a flag are higher exp per hour, then
I'd be more willing to agree that this split works the other way round than what
I experienced.

I"ve always been the same way.  Whatever I'm doing, I want that to be done fast,
not slow it down but also be doing something else slowly.  I figure if the level
will make a difference then I'll get it, and thus get that AA faster.  Or if the
AA will make a difference, get that, and then when I go back to leveling I'll
get it faster.

Since my main is 65, he doesn't have to make that choice anymore, but when I die
I do put 100% real back on till I make up the loss.

My alt is 57, where I stopped to get him run 3.  Its a long pause in leveling,
and I keep thinking I should go 58 for the AE Cantata... but soloing will be
much easier with run 3.

Very much agree.  On Morel Thule, 100K.  When and If I ever get that spell, its
going to be from turning in a rune, which means winning a drop in a 30 person
raid with 75% of the people there rolling on it, and then getting lucky with the
hand in (lots of other spells besides HOV)
