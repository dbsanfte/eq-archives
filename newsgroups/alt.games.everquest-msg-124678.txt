That would so not work on Prexus.  What with the gimp guild I've mentioned
jacking our Tormax raids, if somebody can setup closer than you (in a safe
place to fight the mob) then thas what they will do.

Were ally CoV/Dorf, sortof..  broods/nToV made a lot of people kos, pharming
Dain made a lot of people kos too.. but officially were CoV faction.

Killing Tormax is a great time for us to fix faction, so even if we could
single pull agro Tormy, it wouldn't be in our interests to.   Im assuming
you guys (or your monks) are on Kael faction?

Im ally zek, amiable riff, warmly tormax atm (questing) but after his next
pop I will be back to kos in Kael again within 1-2 days (Dorf belts is the
only time our monks have worked up kael faction).. and a tormax pull while
kos, in a fully popped kael, from his room to WL, just seems like too much
of a headache.

We pull and kill at the bank.

Whats funny on Prexus, one guild who gate crashed an nToV raid, actually
flamed the original guild on their messages board.   It became an awesome
classic rant (which for some reason contained 1 page of flames to that
guild, and like 10 pages of flames to us heh)

We've had monks tank nToV named dragons etc, but Cazic was (to my knowledge)
a first for monk tanking.

I hear LoS used a naked bard to tank nToV named dragons... Lol

Btw i did post on your boards, and you ignored me!! /rude :(
