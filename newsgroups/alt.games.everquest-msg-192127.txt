 And if you prefer a zone line, go over by Griegs. That's usually a
pretty train-free zone line. To be anywhere between two common zones is
a guaranteed train. I know when I run through DS I don't bother to kill
greens if they aggro. I run along the wall so it's not like I try to
aggro them. 

 I do call mobs and say which zone I'm headed to though.
