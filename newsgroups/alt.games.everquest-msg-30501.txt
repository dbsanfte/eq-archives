That's the meat, but what good is a roast without all the trimmings. A
fully buffed and supported warrior doubles his effectiveness.

But they double as a wizard with Trueshot...

Their +ATK songs, for starters. When you're fighting a mob 15 levels
above you, every little bit of +ATK you can get makes a noticeable
difference. Fight Aerionia (sp?) in nToV, see your ATK drop 300 points,
and watch yourself hit for 1s and 2s if you don't believe the effect.
Mana, regen, stackable dam shields, massive resists, DotB, etc. etc.
etc.  Although they don't double up very well, there's certainly room
for one per group on any raid
