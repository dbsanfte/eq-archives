    That relates to a problem one of my server's second-tier guilds is
having. The guild lead wants to get started on a Luclin faction path NOW, so
they can start camping stuff before it becomes well known and high-demand.
The response from his guild has been "No, we wait to see what faction is
'best', then we go to that faction." His guild's clerics have even
threatened to stop raiding if this path isn't followed. So how are you
handling the Luclin faction issue, or are you still raiding the factionless
areas/old world content?
