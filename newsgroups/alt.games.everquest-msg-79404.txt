There also seems to be something a bit odd with how the blue bar works.
I have been killing those crazy goblins in BB to get me through 30.
They are all either 29 or 30, but *seem* to give vastly different xp.

Looking at the bar :

<=><=><=><=><=>    Xp bar !

It seems to me that in the middle of bubles "=" the bar moves more for
the same xp.
While in the narrowings "><" the bar seems to move much slower.
I noticed this alot especially at the end of yellow bubbles ">"

However as kas said things yellow to you can be very different in level
and thus xp.
I'm not sure what the first "RED" level would be to you at 38, but a
level 39 Mob (in a zone with ZEM=100) is worth about 152k xp while a
level 45 is worth about 202k.

I suspect a combination of the two.

HTH,

Jim
