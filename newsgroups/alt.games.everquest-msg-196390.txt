Spent 100pp on a Turtleshell Helm for my Frog Paladin and watched
what happened, as far as I can ascertain the 'drained' message is a
failed roll for the focus effect to fire.

With Light Healing I got several heals for 31 with the 'drained'
message which I suspect is the same amount I'd heal with the helm in
a bag.  Most times the focus effect kicked in and I got a few more
HPs out of it.

Very odd and not a little bit sad that the devs think that these
items could in any way be unbalancing while leaving other stuff
intact (see also: recommended levels on some items, none on others,
seemingly on a whim.)
