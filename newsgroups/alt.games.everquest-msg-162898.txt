I used to port  to generate cash to upgrade my monk after he was nerfed, and
get about 1 k and then quit. It took a few hours sometimes, and sometimes
days (now i farm, much easier and more interesting, and the beasts don't
cheat me on tips). now, I port in to WC to pick up some fish and kill
kizdaen gix or whatever his name is (sometimes just meleeing him to death!
bwahahaha!) and the zone is empty. It used to be full of people beging for
ports, and druids competing for the fare. The competition has disapeared,
and so has the rides generally, but you'll get a guy standing there for ages
shouting for one, and i'll be the only druid in the zone, anon, because i'm
not porting for 10 pp ever again (although i may port for free if asked
nicely).

It's exactly the same as the taxi situation in the small town as compared to
the city. The small town taxi driver always has work, but the people who
need a ride may have to wait a long time. It doesn't mean there as many
drivers as in the city, and i can tell you there used to be a lot of druids
and wizards desperately typing to get in first to answer that "donating for
a port!".

There's a healthy market for ports for a very few porters. But for those
without PoP, getting a port has actually become harder and less reliable,
and my ears perk up with nostalgia when i hear a druid running through a
zone advertising a port service... spending ten or fifteen minutes of his
time (counting running, zoning, mana regen, running from something nasty in
EJ or being eaten by wuoshi) getting 10 pp... when i am thinking of buying
my solstice gear from farming light and dark blues.. checks mule... another
600 pp... ching!
