  But everything else is perfect, right?

   /sigh  The thing about doing the FAQ is that there is always more to
add, more that could be expanded on to be even more correct.  Massive as
the FAQ is, it could easily be four or five times bigger.

   So does it really need a in depth pet section?  I would guess no.  By
the time this gets to be an issue, the person is probably not a newbie
anymore, to which the FAQ is more or less aimed for. 

  Of course, I don't like having wrong information listed.  I would be
tempted to fix this by simply adding a brief aside that the green line for
enchanter might mean they have summoned an animation.
