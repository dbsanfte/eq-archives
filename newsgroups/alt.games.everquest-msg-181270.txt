It's graphics lag. Get over it. No one's computer runs this code well on 
the moon.

Again, there is not a computer made that will perform flawlessly in the 
Luclin zones with graphics options set to high.

You were being an ass. What did you expect? You insult them, they will 
respond. Their game, their rules. Besides, like I said, you were getting 
worked up about a bug that doesn't exist. It's not a bug, it's merely a 
limitation of the game code.

Now you're just being silly. It is just what they said - to keep people 
from using harsh language. You know, make it an environment most 
enjoyable for everyone?

Not in their forum. What do you expect? It's not a democracy. You become 
disruptive, they smack you down. Stop playing if it's so terrible. You 
won't, because it's not. You're just overreacting to flaws you mistake 
for bugs.

That's what this group is for. Spread word that needs spreading. Thing is 
though, you better come correct here too.

You're proving that by sticking around even though you claim things are 
so horrible.
