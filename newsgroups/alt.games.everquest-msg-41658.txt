You know I am almost sorry I posted the original OT.  I posted it because i
figured like myself who normally doesn't watch the news, many people here were
probably in the same boat.  I would not have heard about it if someone hadn't
called me on the phone.  It was more of a hey watch the news, there is some
major shit going down.  Not another Fucking excuse for everybody and there
brother to degenerate into a name calling fest.

If you want a scape goat for it being in this newsgroup feel free to blame me,
but.....
