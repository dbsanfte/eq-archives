  Heh.  This leaves me little hope that the open raids vs. Vox on my server
will have any prayer of success, because open raids are by their very nature
less coordinated than guild raids, and given the underpopulated nature of
the server, I doubt any guild will have enough level 45-52 characters to
take her down.  I have to wonder if Vox will ever die again on Firiona Vie.
At least I got to slay her once before the patch.
