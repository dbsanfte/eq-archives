I believe they are wrong.  Bard's do get a V3 haste song at level 52
but it and the level 60 version are from Luclin scrolls.  Up until then
(Luclin expansion, level 52), there are no Bard songs with stacking
haste.

They may as well drop in a regen song or an extra DoT...

BTW if you can't twist 4 songs now (well at least once you stop missing
notes every other time you try) then it isn't a matter of skill, just
ignorance of /melody
