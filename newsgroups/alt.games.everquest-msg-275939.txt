I have transferred characters across accounts without a problem, but all 3
have the same billing info.
AFAIK they only do a transfer where the billing info is the same, no
exceptions.
It may permit you to apply for a transfer, but you will probably hit a snag
when they go to do it and they see that the billing info is different.
