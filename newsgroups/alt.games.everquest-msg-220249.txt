I've been playing this game for four years, and in that time there has never
been as fundamental a change to how people play the game as that one.  And
for every significant change that has come down the pike, the player base
has known about it before it went in.  (IE. The dot nerf, the CH aggro
change, the level limit on group spells)

But by all means, Dark Tyger, continue on spending your free time reading
5-15 page patch messages every week, and continue on noting that a rogue
dagger from the Plane of Time that you'll never own in your entire EQ career
has had the mana on it changed to hit points, that parrying daggers now have
a new graphic, that a tradeskill recipe that you're never going to make uses
a different item than what it had previously, and that brand new characters
will now spawn with 20 food and drink instead of five, and feel completely
assured that you're being the smart one.  I'll just be playing EQ instead.

Btw, it took me less time to figure out on my own what had changed than it
would have to read that patch message, but then, I'm not very bright.
