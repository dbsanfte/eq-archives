Memory management under Win9x is definitely inferior to WinNT/2k/XP, 
this is well known. However, if all you are doing is booting the 
machine, then going straight into one application (EQ) it is fine. I 
have 512MB in my machine and it runs EQ fine (Athlon XP 1600, GeForce 2 
Ti, SB Live). I always reboot before and after playing EQ anyway, or any 
game for that matter, and only turn my PC on when I need it. Rebooting 
isn't needed as much under Win2k, but its still a good idea.

Indeed you do. Keep in mind the main reason I choose ME is because of 
games. Rebooting before I spend hours playing a game isn't a big deal IMHO.

It may purr, but it still uses more resources. Sure if you have more 
resources you won't notice it, but I still feel those resources are 
going to waste being chewed up by the operating system. I found the most 
I could cut down Win2k's memory usage on a clean boot was down from the 
default 60MB to 50MB (excluding disk cache). Under WinME this is 30MB.

I have my work PC running Win2k pretty much 24/7. I find if I keep it up 
without a reboot longer than 3 or 4 days I fall victim to Microsoft's 
mysterious spontaneous reboot feature, even AFTER I've unselected 
"Automatically Reboot" under "Startup and Recovery". This is possibly 
because I do a lot with it, including a lot of adding/deleting routes 
and IP addresses, but its still a testament to Windows instability. 
Although Win2k is far more stable than Win9x, it is still a far cry from 
the likes of Linux and others. Windows isn't stable no matter which 
version you use.

Since you have an Audigy, what is your sound like under Win2k playing EQ?
