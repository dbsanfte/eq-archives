Fletching Skill is never going to make you rich, it was designed to give you
a slight pulling edge. You can recoop some losses by selling Stacks of 150
range 1dam arrows for 2-5plat depending on where you are and the nearest
Fletching Vendor. Also unless you are planing on makeing Darkwood Bows there
is no reason to advance the skill past 100. All you are intrested in is a
good long range arrow to pull with,  it is too expencive to Kite with a bow
and arrow.
