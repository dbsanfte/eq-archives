I am confused about this zone, and not impressed with the information on eq
atlas or allakhazams.  My level 52 ranger and 51 wizard friend would like to
play here, (we think).  I just don't want the wiz to get killed the minute we
beam in.
We have been killing frost giants in EW for ages.  Will that Waoushi dragon
attack us on site when we beam into the wizard spires?  If so what are the odds
of running through Kael invisible?
Anyone know of any GOOD guide to playing there?  My google search didn't come
up with much either.
