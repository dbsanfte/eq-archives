i got a lock up =(, i think all it has done is made lock ups less frequent.
if i disable sound i get no lock ups wotsoever.
i will take out my 3d sound card and use my low-end-spec mobo in-built sound
and see if that causes lock ups too.
if it does i will have to reformat and go back to w98.
this is all a right royal PITA.
o, and having to turn the puter off manually is also a right royal PITA.
but thanks guys anyway for the help.
