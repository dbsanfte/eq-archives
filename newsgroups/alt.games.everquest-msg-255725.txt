I don't see what one has to do with the other. There is no reason that 
one group content needs to come faster.

Minimally; you could use the world 'one group' and it would pan out the 
same.

It was rhetorical. Yes I know that's the case.

Er... you don't farm them. Slight difference.

Good point. I can see some logic in that -- to a point. However, if you 
abandoned raiding and just ground xp in the gear you could get while 
grinding xp than you might end up farther ahead 'character advancement 
xp-wise' over all... sure you xp slower, but you have hundreds of hours 
extra in which to do it because you aren't raiding.

The interesting result of this discussion is that you've essentially 
said you and your guild evidently do not actually particularly want raid 
content. If you could get better gear in an LDoN Hard or GoD trials you 
would be content doing those for your upgrades?

So why is SOE pushing Raid content down our throats? If even the raiders 
don't particularly want it for its own sake. Why not just make longer 
more complex one group content with the same rewards and push those out 
alongside raid content and let players pick their own path to the uber 
loot. If one path proves to be shorter/easier, tweak it until they're 
balanced.

SOE has lots of tools at its disposal to deal with making one group 
content non-zergable, even without massive zone instancing, which when 
over used takes the mm out of mmorpg. Consider what Nag and Vox do... 
add to that  mobs that can see whats coming at them in terms of forces, 
and react by summoning/spawning friends, gating immediately, depopping, 
etc etc... add instanced microzones for named that only a group can get 
into. 

Preserve the groups bumping into eachother and interacting while getting 
to various mobs, but splice them into an instance for the various 
importnat 'encounters'.

We don't -need- raids, and even the raiders don't particular -want- 
raids. So why not come up with more intelligent ways of making 
challenging content that can't be defeated just by recruiting more 
guildies to throw at it.

Some of the more interesting PoP and GoD stuff is doing some of what I'm 
talking about, but its almost exclusively raid content.

Someone else said what I'm talking about is impossible because single 
groups are too class oriented to make balancing possible at that level, 
leading to class desireability issues. But that is not a new problem 
even with the raid game it exists... some classes are highly 
interchangeable on a raid, and some are not, leading to the 
interchangeable ones being comparatively undesirable, and some classes 
do not 'stack' as well with other members of the same class. E.g. you 
only need so many bards; and too many necros start getting in eachothers 
way too.

Its a problem SOE should address and its a problem that *can* be 
addressed.
