Exactly what it says. Turns 15/21 to a 17/21.  To understand what
exactly that means in terms of how much more damage you do means
understanding how melee damage is calculated. Backstabs have a HUGE
multiplier, too, so it's entirely possible that 2 more dmg on the
weapon boosted his average BS by 250 depending on his level, BS skill,
and str.
