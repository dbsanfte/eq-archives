I said it was gimp. And if you want to try to argue with someone's
personal opinion, have fun.

>but really, when your foot gets put in your mouth as much as yours is

shrug.. it was a mistake.. that being RZTW for sol ro flag. You caught
me in it, good for you, hope you feel all warm and fuzzy. That having
been said the rest of the post still holds true.. you don't need to
build your own raiding guild to get in TSR and its not that hard to
get the flag given fair luck on timing. TZ/VZ always tend to be
problematic because they usually go down so fast.

>you might want to try keeping the mouth shut once in a while.

Nah. You seem to get the feeling I'm afraid of being wrong. I'm not.

Shrug... whatever. The point was that TSR flags were these incredibly
hard things to get that you had to build a raiding guild to get them,
and that just isn't the case. Yeah.. I flubbed. RZTW opens Earth, Air,
Water.. my bad I got a bit ahead of myself. For those that want in TSR
there are any myriad of open raiding guilds and options that can help
you do it if you wish to put in the work. Is this something you
dispute? Or do you suggest all people go out and start their own
raiding guilds and build from scratch when they want to get flagged
for TSR? Yeah.. sorry.. what was i thinking /sarcasm.

Second, you can wonder whatever you want. I know what I've seen and I
know what i've done.
