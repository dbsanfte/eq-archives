It's not impossible, just really annoying.  A couple of options off the top
of my head:

1) Summon Corpse

2) Get someone who is not KOS to Wuoshi to port in.  Make sure they have SOW
and LOTS of hitpoints (because you're right, Velious rules).  I'd suggest
someone as high as possible, preferably a warrior.

Wuoshi isn't 100% deadly.  The warrior doesn't have to pull the corpse all
the way to the zone line, he just needs to pull it out of the valley.  If
he's not KOS to the giants he could very well get it to the zone if he's
lucky.  Still, once it's out of the valley CR is easy.  If you have a
high-40s warrior all buffed up and a level 49 cleric waiting to rez him it
shouldn't be too hard to talk him into dying for the cause.

But #1 is my choice. :)
