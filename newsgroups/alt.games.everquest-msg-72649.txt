Better yet, they will hit other mobs with their arrows if you can line up
the shot.  This happens with PC archers too, they have to be careful...
but NPC archers don't give it a second thought.  Like a newbie ranger
trying to bow fear kite, they let fly just as soon as their delay cycles
regardless of what (as you saw) or who is in line of fire.

Get them lined up so that you are both running the same direction as
an NPC mob (elephants make large convenient targets) and time it so you
run past the mob shortly before the next shot and they will plink that
mob instead of you... mob will turn on them like a pet who's master
was shot.  Most of the time your range will be sufficient to get the
cent to stop and engage.  This will stop the archery nuisance, stop you
having to run all over SK, give you added damage production, increase
the damage output of your DOTs... but it does risk the elephant
getting the kill.  Usually there's little danger of this, but if it does become

an issue, snare the elephant near the end of the fight and you'll get
both him and the cent on you, finish the cent and then the (also mostly
dead) elephant for extra exp, just like running a charm animal, only
without the cast cost and without the possibility of it breaking!
