Fair enough.

Well, my initial vague understanding of Taunt derived strictly from my 
own experience and rumination really wasn't much better than nothing.  I 
  then encountered the pass/fail affected by 
skill/moblevel/hatedifference theory and that helped me a lot.  Much 
more recently there has been some discussion of agro/Taunt here (forget 
which threads) in which Davian's and Martin's comments have cleared up a 
lot of fuzzy bits around the edges.  I summed up my current 
understanding in a reply to Horus in this thread, though I forgot to 
mention that hate decays (i.e. decreases over time, tacitly confirmed by 
VI during the Conquest/Sleeper pathing exploit fiasco) because I've 
rarely seen that matter.

I did see a post in this thread that recommended mashing as a policy 
with the explicit assumption that casters were gonna be doing high agro 
things all the time so you never have any idea whether they've passed 
you on the hate list.  While that's a valid point if your casters behave 
that way, I can't recall a group that acted like that since I abandoned 
pickup grouping in the Dreadlands.  In groups since then the casters 
have been very conscious of agro and behaved accordingly, the only agro 
problems have been because of clueless melees:  SKs who insist on 
casting high agro spells regardless of circumstances, Paladins who stun 
melee mobs, Warriors who carry only fast 1h weapons with high agro procs 
(not clever if you're L53 and grouped with a ghetto L59, the L53 took 
way more pounding than he should have despite the L59's advantage in 
damage output using decent 20-ish delay weapons, the L53 left eventually 
and the Cleric heaved a sigh of relief).
