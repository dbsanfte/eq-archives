The problem is, in the 20s there's not much point in a druid shelling
out cash for a max damage weapon when you could easily have had
something with a couple stats in that hand instead. I don't see any
point in working on the 2hb when you've gotten this far, but I'd
definitely start working on 1hb and get a weapon in that skill
instead. There are plenty good 1hbs with and without +wis available at
mid levels, while you have to go running around planes and killing
gods and dragons if you *ever* want a scimitar with stats.
