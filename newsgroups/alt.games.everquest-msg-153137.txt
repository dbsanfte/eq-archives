No no no no... a thousand times no.

No matter what sort of noise it is - squawk, squeek, tone, melody, beat,
etc - it would be annoying in less than 5 minutes.  It would be like
a druid chain casting four cast time spells all with different sounds
over and over and over... my head would explode, or at least develop an
football-sized aneurism :P
