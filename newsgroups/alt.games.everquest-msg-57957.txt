you become better at a skill like that based upon what skill the song uses.
not the intruement u carry
EX: jonanthins whistleing warsong. is singing skill.
u will become better at singing as long as you are using the song. you could
have no intruement at all in you hand or a drum horn whatever.
Instruments make the song better. Drums for example make seleo song move u
faster. it increases the effectiveness of all percussion songs.
you dont need an instruemnt to become better at the skill each song uses
