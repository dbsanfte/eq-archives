Wrong:
Prior to going Loral posted this:
http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-1950615164
On return Loral posted this:
http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-1863105531

If your going WTF is Loral, he is the person who has posted the
History of Loral's Adventure in Norath here in these forums.
He is a member of Healers United, (a long time standing Family NON
uber guild on Quellious).

go read what He has to say... before and after..

So, your saying if you raid, then your in the top 10%... I call major
BS on this.  Not all raid encounters are UBER....

Er, um no, its leadership AA.. anyone can get em... just have to
dedicate exp to it... like ANY AA you wish to have.  Only hitch is you
had to purchase GoD.

I have been in several guilds that would have found this an asset.

FYI, my first character just reached 65, I have NEVER been in ANY uber
guild.  All the guilds have been family casual guilds.
