I've seen someone offer 800pp for a port from CS to DL... and go
portless, despite there being several druids and at least two wizards
in the zone.

Seems a bad reputation does have its costs... and at the same time,
when the potential porters are in their 50s, 800pp just isn't all
that important.

I know I recently turned down 500pp to go res someone in EW,
which certainly would have been easy money, yet I couldn't care
less about the cash, and wasn't about to leave my friends to
go res someone I didn't know.  Drag it to me in the zone I'm in
and I'll do it for free when mana levels are healthy.  Ask me to
come to you, Kpp might not be enough.

Here's where I think the wizards finally got a bone; TL means
they too can take care of people in thier zone without a lot
of fuss and bother, changing their bind point or having to walk
from thier bind to rejoin thier groups.
