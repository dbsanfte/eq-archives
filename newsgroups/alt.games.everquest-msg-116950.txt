I thought he tried to endorse the product
reasonably well.

And thats why he included it... because players
sometimes commit suicide, and this time his mother
has blamed the game. 

Its also included because its newsworthy... its a
fairly unusual and high-profile case.

I would have thought it odd, if that case hadn't
been mentioned.

I don't think it has anything to do with computer
games being the stuff of the Devil.

It seems more like a grieving mother wondering why
she no longer has a son.

What if EQ caused the depression?

It might in some cases, but certainly not in "any
case". People can, and do, make rational decisions
all the time, while suffering from depression.

If EQ is responsible for his death, then they
should pay, as should every other entity that is
guilty of causing harm by negligence.

Whether they are guilty or not, is up to a court
to decide.

I don't think he ever intended it to be an
in-depth article.

More like one of those 3 minute toilet break
stories.

I thought that the ""The longest conversation in
our house at dinner," she says, "is about what
we've done in Norrath that day."" comment was far
more negative (and poignantly telling) than the
anecdote about the suicide
