Funny thing you say that.  Die in any PoP zone, and 10 minutes later your body pops up in the "graveyard" of
that zone, which is a safe spot (unless trained) at the zone in.

Noone is "busy doing CR's in PoP", one of the finest things about the expansion.  If someone in your group
dies, you rez him to you and he loots up.  If you wipe, you go to the graveyard and wait a few minutes.

On the other hand, since from 61 on, the only worthwhile exp you'll ever see seems to all be in PoP zones,
the high level players you were hoping were on CRs are instead busy squabbling over yard trash at the zone
lines.
