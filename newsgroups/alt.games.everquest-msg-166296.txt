Not only does it work, it works quite well.  The key is to make sure the ice
burrower hates someone other than the pet... which is easy to do, as any bard
can tell you, the tricky part is making the target mob fight your charmed pet...
in this case, you want the IB to follow you with the pet chasing it.  Since the
proc is indeed a melee based one, denying the IB any opportunity to melee is the
key to defeating it.  Hate kiting does this handily.

I'm not spouting a theoretical kill method here, I've been the cleric in the duo
I'm describing many many times, got four of the rare drop IB tshirts to drop,
one a surprise, rotted, one went to my druid partners' alt monk, another rotted
when the designated looter died and crashed on rez, and the fourth went to a
guildmate.  The exp was good, but nothing compared to PoP exp, so we don't do it
much anymore, just on occaision when waiting for a Klandi/Zland/TOV raid.
