Healing someone who is FD will not get the FD person aggro.

In fact, healing someone who is standing around while you are beset with 
mobs will not get him aggro; being healed or buffed is not an agressive 
act.  If the target isn't KOS, or isn't in range to get aggro, then you 
can't cause him to be aggroed by casting on him.

The danger of healing or buffing is not that the person being healed or 
buffed will get aggro, but that the person doing the healing or buffing 
will get aggro.

If someone has aggro, and you heal him, then you get aggro.

BUT if that someone is FD, and I mean successfully FD, not just lying 
down with mobs beating on him because he failed his skill check, then 
you can heal or buff him to your hearts content and not get aggro 
(unless you move within aggro range of the mobs in order to cast).

The danger is that the monk might have failed his check, or might stand 
up while you are in mid cast.  This still won't endanger the monk, but 
can easily result in the things he is working on splitting all coming 
running directly for you.

That means that yes, you should wait for the monk to ask.  Better, you 
should have a conversation with the monk, and arrange to have him send 
you a tell when he wants a heal and is ready for it.  A tight 
relationship between a monk and a healer can make an enormous difference 
in an FD pulling situation.

Back in my cleric days, I was often on "pull detail", and was in those 
cases the ONLY person ever allowed to heal the monk.  This was much 
simpler and more efficient than him asking the raid and having people 
who didn't know what they were doing or how FD worked come up and blow 
things casting at the wrong time.  Its not like healing a monk costs a 
lot of mana, anyway, I was never in any danger of not being able to do 
my real job due to the added duty.
