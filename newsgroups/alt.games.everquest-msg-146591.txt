Would be a nice feature. On the MUD I used play on (and just about every text MUD 
actually) you could use the 'note' command. You could specify certain groups, a 
clan, the imms, another player. Of course in EQ messages to another player would 
probably be the only feasible method, but it would be nice to have that.
