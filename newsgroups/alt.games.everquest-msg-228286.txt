Heh, it often doesn't work all that well even with people that know
how to play together. I think you're usually better off using Tugur's
to grab agro from an add, then you can move it to where you want and
park it. Tigir's also works well on that, at least if you can take the
beating. You're pretty much guaranteed to have all but one mob on you
after you cast that. 

It will get better with once you get Virulent Paraysis, it gives you a
nice knockback (in the direction that you're facing when the spell
lands) so you can position an add pretty easily without having to
bother the melees.
