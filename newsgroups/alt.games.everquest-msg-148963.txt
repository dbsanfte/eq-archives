Indeed, I very rarely see a cleric doing this click dance, but
I used to do it happily, and not just powerleveling.  A constant
feed of around 1K hp a minute is more than adequate to keep
a monk alive while fighting easy mobs, and there's no down time
at all.  It does become deadly boring, though, I was considering
bopping down to the local Toys R Us and picking up one of those
robot kits to make something that would click my 7 key every ten
seconds while I read or navigate or whatever.

Besides the boredom, there is another problem with the Donals
Arms plan; it drastically reduces the HP total of your "victim"
Valor is the same line as Heroism and included in Aegoism,
in order to use Valor as a "heal/regen" its necessary to sacrifice
several hundred HP in HP total.

I've also happily done long stretches of time chain clicking my
Greaves of Forbidden Rites; proccing a 105 hp group heal
every 12 seconds or so.  Half the effect of Donals Arms, but
unlike Donals or the DW helm, I get to keep everyone fully
buffed up.  While I've largely given up the Donal's Arms approach,
I still use the greaves even at level 60 in exp groups, where
they obviate the need to small heal misc party members who
take damage from ripostes, or while pulling or "during the
multiple mobs in camp not mezed yet" periods... as long
as they don't actively have aggro, they (and I) will heal up
nicely a hundred points at a time.
