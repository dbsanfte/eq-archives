    Yep, I've seen that too. The whole front half of the zone has been
ruined for XP by adding some NPCs for quests that nobody does because the
resulting items are so cruddy. And Sol B was actually a rewarding place to
do XP prior to that. Recent quests have destroyed half of Sol B and Lower
Guk as areas people can XP in, and I'm not sure there's a single dev that
cares.
