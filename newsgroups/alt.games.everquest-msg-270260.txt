Exactly.  So I guess I agree that it wouldn't be as much of a
problem if the quests weren't so hard to solve.  One of the
quests I've done told me to seek a monk named Master Rinmark,
last known to have left Cabilis for The Overthere.  Turns out
he's in Timorous Deep, where he shows up as "an iksar master".
I don't know if there's any clue that turns up in The Overthere
to suggest looking in TD, or whether large scale collaboration
led to someone reporting finding this dude there and someone
else thinking to ask him if his name was Rinmark, etc.  But I
*know* I'm glad I didn't have to search all of Norrath looking
for him!

Of course, the question then becomes, if the content keeps
changing, how can the clues keep up?  One monk is told to find
Master Rinmark and gets a clue pointing to the approximate loc
in TD (or maybe the first in a series of clues leading there).
Suppose the quest results in Rinmark deciding to move elsewhere?
Now you need an entirely new set of clues leading to his new
location.  Sure you can do this, and maybe you only need a few
different sets of clues as Rinmark cycles through a small set of
possible hideouts, but multiply this effort by any reasonable
number of quests and the design effort is enormous.
