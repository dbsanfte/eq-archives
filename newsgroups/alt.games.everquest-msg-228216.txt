Bother to read the original post. The price was an implied
advertisement that the item was something more than the "normal" mold.
Though it can't be proven a scam to the GMs, because the GMs have to
give the benefit of the doubt. However, if you read the original post,
the scammer makes it clear that the pricing was INTENDED to fool
someone into buying it thinking it was an ornate mold. It doesn't
matter if he advertised it as such or whatnot, he was preying off
ignorance and carelessness, which is highly unethical by most
standards.

I think of it as similar to these "fat finger dialing scams" some
1-800 collect type companies pull by setting their numbers one digit
off, and one that's highly likely to be hit by accident when trying to
dial the intended number and charging 200+% of the rate the intended
company charges. They don't actively fool anyone, but they are preying
off carelessness, and there is legal action pending against them. The
FCC even has an alert line for this sort of scam.
