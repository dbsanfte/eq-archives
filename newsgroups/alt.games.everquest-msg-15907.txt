4 rogues?  Not in a group I'm in thanks.  Will be there forever, rogues are
not meant to tank.  Hubby plays one and every time he "thinks" he's the tank
he get hurt more than planned.

Good group... 1 cleric, 1 ranger (dual wield and tracking is great), 1 or 2
warriors (could replace the 1 warrior with a monk), 1 shaman, and 1
enchanter (for crowd control, and clarity for the casters).  Other adds
could be a wizzy, useful in those last minute nukes, a rogue is nice to have
along when your tank is getting creamed, or the mob is paying too much
attention to the casters.  Then one good Back Stab and wham!  They don't
care about the caster anymore.  But it all depends on where your fighting
and what your fighting.

Just my 2cp worth
