Piggybacking on Lance's post -

Your absolute BEST soloing pet before level 51
is your fire pet.  If you don't have it (I thought
39 and 44 fire were purchaseble - it's been a while)
GET it.  Yes it has fewer HP than earth, but it's
DS is completely free, huge damage.  (it's pet level
+ 2, so the 39 fire pet (level 33) has a 35pt DS on
it).  It takes a bit more attention to timing than
an earth pet, as well as careful attention to aggro,
but you use way less mana per pull.

I used fire for soloing from 29 through 51.  Don't
trust the new pet hp guage, It doesnt' update fast
enough, I'd still Nuke/pet report health - repeat.

Average length of a fight for me was around 30 seconds.
Malise to pull, send in pet - sit and wait for
pet to build aggro, stand and nuke, sit.  (checking
pet hp all along) stand and drop one more nuke
to make the mob run - pet is usually at 30-40%
health.  Resists are what kill - you have to nuke
twice, eating mana and taking the chance of 
drawing aggro.

Remember - dark blues are 3/4 of your level and
up, light blues 2/3rds.  at 41 anything 31 or 
up is dark blue.  At the same time, XP for a mob
is directly proportional (for now - things changing
on Test) to Level^2.  So a level 31 will give you
60% of the xp of a level 40 mob, and you'll be able
to take the 31's at a far faster rate, making much
better xp, with a much lower chance of having to run.
