What makes sense is based on the history of the particular world.  I know 
very little about Norrathian history.

Why would Orcs or Goblins make more sense than Frogloks as end-game 
material in EQ?

Do any of the new history texts in PoK refer to the Froggy empire?  If so, 
I think it would make a nice read.

I wish I could get my AAs without getting the various titles that go with 
them.  Is there anyway of turning off your Title so that others can't see 
it?
