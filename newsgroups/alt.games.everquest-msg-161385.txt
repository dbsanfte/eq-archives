No, I mean "looking like an idiot to distract the media from the subtle evil
genius of his handlers."

The fact that Danny Boy seems to be an actual idiot doesn't mean its
impossible that Dubya is faking his idiocy, although I don't see how I'm
supposed to tell the difference.

Listening to your handlers doesn't require intellect, it merely requires a
willingness to follow orders, presumably what he was selected for.  Name
recognition, a certain basic affability, and "party loyalty".

Personally, I think he listened TOO MUCH on 9/11, and went into hiding when
any figurehead worthy of his post would have done his best to appear
immediately in front of the public in the strongest possible showing.
Playing hide and seek was of course prudent... but prudent isn't something
that makes you great.  Rudy showed himself a great man under pressure, while
Georgie hesitated, and only went into the same basic stance after a
substantial delay, when it was safer to do so... but when it was just a case
of following a trail already blazed by a better man, and trying to claim it
for himself.

I particularly enjoyed the part where he was trying to line up other nations
to come help on the Iraq attack, and offering to cut them in on the oil deals
that would be made afterwards (or was it threatening to cut them out of the
oil deals if they didn't play ball?  Months ago, I get it mixed up)

Precisely my point, in reality the lad's a real card, sharp and witty and fun
loving.  Coworkers in the senate have always said so, but during the
excruciating presidential campaign he presented himself stiffer than a dime
store indian.  The moment the campaign ended he made his SNL appearance,
shilled out for that Viagra commercial, and out and out lit up like a 1000
watt bulb, I'd have voted for New Dole over Clinton in a heartbeat.

In fact, its this transformation that makes me most willing to credit Bush
with not being as dumb as he seems; clearly the GOP is quite capable of
getting their figureheads to act in ways counter to their actual
personalities and capabilities, for whatever nefarious or misguided reasons
you may wish to imagine.
