My personal favorite was the "snow white and the seven dwarfs" virus.  It
looked for plug-ins for itself.  One of them would mass-mail everyone in
your address book (think it even searched for other addresses in your
e-mails).  Problem wasn't that it mailed itself.  It mailed everyone acting
as if it was you (like other viruses do), but making the message look as if
you wanted them to go visit a great porn site you just found.  I worked in
ISP tech support at the time (before the company pulled it to give it to
some cheap Canadians who sent their business to hell...but they deserve it
for being cheap).  I was just waiting to get the call from a preacher who
got infected by this one.  Imagine the shock of that one if it hit the
church mailing list. =)
