Let me preface this reply by saying that in many ways I *am* talking out of
my ass and all of this is simply opinion, but just wanted to toss an idea
out here that would make this last statement untrue to some extent.

Current scientific model suggests that the universe began from a
singularity, a point in which all matter existed in an extremely dense
point, resulting in the big bang, spreading all matter out, eventually
causing planets, on which at least one life evolved as we know it.  Some
scientists also theorize that the pressure of the big bang exerted against
this gravitational pull of such a dense mass will eventually (or has already
begun to) reverse resulting in a "big crush" in which everything that exists
comes back together into another singularity.

Now, (and this is where I totally step outside current scientific theory,
which I'm fully aware of, no need to flame) supposing that this new
singularity has the same principles applied to it that the first singularity
had.  Suppose this "new" singularity explodes again in a fresh big bang, new
planets and new life.

Now, (stepping even further away) suppose the big bang we "know" about now
is NOT the first big bang and that this has been happening over and over
again for a very long period of time.  I've generally pictured this as the
breathing in and breathing out of the universe, but that's just imagery.
And of course, this being the case, this continual flux and flow could, in
theory, go on for a long, indefinite period of time.

And to get back to the point of, "when it comes to early cosmology it is in
fact possible to have both a beginning and an "always existed" at the same
time," what if this flux and flow has been going on forever, and never truly
"began" in a finite sense.  To the western mind this is difficult to think
of since we think of everything in a linear sense, i.e. beginning, middle,
end.  To the eastern mind, everything is much more circular, continuing
along a path, but this path constantly revolving on itself contiuing forever
(read the I Ching for this path of change as a good example) and neither
having beginning or and end.  Of course nothing can really prove whether the
west or the east are correct, just pointing out that sometimes we have a
hard time with eternality because of our culture.  Anyway, IF this flux and
flow have continued forever, then it is possible for the universe to always
have existed, and (going semantic and adding a couple words in here) for the
universe "as we know it" to have a beginning.

Anyway, in the words of Dennis Miller, this is all just my opinion, I could
be wrong, but still seems an interesting possibility to me.
