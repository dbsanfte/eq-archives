Still it seems inconvenient. I'm in a guild and I like the idea of us
all living in a guild hall. I know that there are things in the game
you need Social Points for but from what I've seen so far- like quest
items being of finer quality than crafted items (through level 20 at
least)- I am not convinced that living in these areas are worth the
inconvenience of being one more zone away from the action.
