Try pinging the hops to the server next time, instead of making assumptions.
You will probably find its NOT verant. Theres a ton of things I dont like
about EQ, but internet connection is not one of them.
Pretty much all the time I get a perfect connection... 0% packet loss.
Try battle net if you want to see servers that are too busy.

That said, I can sympathize with net death.
I would sooner people had the opportunity to cheat by pulling the plug, than
this bullshit 30 second thing being imposed.
Its only that death is pretty benign that I tolerate it.
