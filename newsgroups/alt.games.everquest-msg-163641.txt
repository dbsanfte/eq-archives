Unfortunately, if they intended on having EQ played as a RPG, they failed in
their design.  None of the game mechanics support this option.  The only way
to develop your character to any extent is to go out and kill mobs.  This
would be like me making a car, but instead of wheels, making it watertight,
giving it a screw and rudder, then wondering why people call it a boat.
