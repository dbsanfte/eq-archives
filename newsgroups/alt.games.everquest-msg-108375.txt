hehe - so YOU were the guys that kept training our guild in the Arena the

Unmezzable MOBs are not usually rootable - not by druids anyway whose root
gets a damage resist check as well. Kiting indoors is tough without Sow,
anyone can kite with runspeed 3.

hehe - True. Shamans do A LOT in a raid, while the druid really has nothing
else to spend mana on except an inferior regen. I hope that is not your
point.

Aye, damage is damage. But having the MOB die halfway through the DOT is
terribly mana inefficient. DD's are better, especially since Druid dot's
generally don't stack with other druids (can't cast it anyway). Add to that
the dot will make a mob unmezzable generally makes dots a bad idea on raids.

They do get Lesser Evac????? Also Mana Burn, unresistable DD's, root.

Funny thing is I agree with this, even though I seem to argue against it.
Druids are fun and versatile to play post 50. Their utility vanishes,
though, in raid situations where they are not "best" at anything and none of
their abilities are unique or stackable.
