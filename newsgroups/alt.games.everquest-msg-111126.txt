I'm thinking sub of EQ2 won't be much more, which will be another nail
in EQ1's coffin. I mean, standard mmorpg price by then will be $15.95
at most (maybe $19.95 but that is pushing it) Would you rather be
continuing to pay $12.95 for a dinosaur or $15.95 for its second
generation improvement? EQ1 has worn thin for me so many times now
that I've tried every other MMORPG in desperation, if one can get back
the original magic it will be EQ2.

The thing is, for EQ2, the Legends type server will be moot. Its
already been said it has less XP loss, no loss of level and probably
no CR to speak of. That cuts your Customer Service load a whopping ton
(most petitions in EQ seem to come from accidental death/xp loss or
corpse problems) The main point of legends is full GM CS available
within 15 minutes.

I'd guess EQ1 will receive pretty much no more development beyond bug
patching once EQ2 rolls in. If you think about it, they have been
balancing and are doing casters next. Once balancing, finally after 3
YEARS, is done and post planes of power stuff EQ2 will be approaching.

In some ways playing EQ1 now almost seems like going through the
motions while waitng for SWG, EQ2 and Worlds of Warcraft. Really I
should just take a vacation from MMORPGS and not play EQ until that
other stuff is out. No, you can't have my stuff!
