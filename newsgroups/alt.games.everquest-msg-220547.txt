    Allow me to be the voice of dissent. ;-) B5 is no better or worse than
other sci-fi out there. They rely on gimicks that should long ago have been
banished from all sci-fi, like the all-knowing character that only reveals
tiny bits of information at a time just because. Or time travel episodes
where future episodes and plot developments are essentially spoiled,
especially once you realize that the writers come from the "time travel
can't change anything" school.

    I also found most of the characters to be overblown, with not a trace of
nuance to them. For example, from ST:TNG, I found Data, Worf, and Picard to
be compelling characters. They weren't cardboard cutouts, and their foils
(Lore, pretty much any Klingon, Riker) created interesting storylines. It
didn't have the overall plot quality of B5, something I will praise the
series for, but it was great as a character study. B5, in my opinion, had
only two characters really worth watching to see:
what's-his-former-security-captain-controlled-by-Psi, and Londo. The
ex-security guy's storylines came off as very irrelevant to the overall
story, so he was marginalized. Londo is a good reason to watch the show -
he's nuanced, his changes are evolutionary rather than revolutionary (like
his foil, G'Kar), his story is very central to the overall story. I just
wish they hadn't spoiled his fate with stupid time travel episodes. :-/

    So, yeah. I'd put B5 at about the same level of quality as ST:Deep Space
9. Good story arc, many sci-fi cliches, and a lot of throwaway characters.

    James
