If I'm just standing around (usually thinking about drive-by buffs) and I
see someone with blue lettering and is /anon, I'll almost always do a
/guildst on them.

If they're /anon regardless of results, however, I'll probably NOT buff
them.  I mean, obviously they want to be left alone, right?  I'd hate to
impinge on their privacy by forcing them to see the buff
message...ESPECIALLY if they're hiding from their guildmates.
