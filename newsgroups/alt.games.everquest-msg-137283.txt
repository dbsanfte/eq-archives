Uh, well, as long as you're adding your own thoughts, I don't think it's 
a bad thing (although you coulda snipped my post, seeing as there was 
nothing you replied to there).  Now, if you'd quoted my entire post then 
just said "I agree!", we would have had to lynch you.

Now see, I'd heard from one person that HHK has an exp bonus too, but I 
thought it was just a rumour, although it'd explain the madly fast exp.  
Can anyone confirm this?  Allakhazam's doesn't say anything about it, 
but then their write-up isn't exactly spot-on either (talking about how 
it's almost always empty! Hah!)

Say, that's *exactly* what I do :D

Oh, he'll do it.  When he sees that exp bar he'll do it.  Just like we 
all do.  Day after life-sucking day :D
