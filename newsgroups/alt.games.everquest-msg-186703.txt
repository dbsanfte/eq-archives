You are absolutely wrong.  I have fished on the boat from FP to BBM, in 
fact that is how I used to pass the time while I used the boat.  It is kind 
of annoying, as every time the boat changes heading, you have to jockey 
around to find that sweet spot that you can fish from, but it is definitely 
possible.  I have found that it is not possible to fish from the FV to BBM 
boat, as it is too high off the water.
