Guild chat uses only one filter. Right click on the targeted window, select
filter | guild.

If a channel called guild was created (it isn't by default), you must select
filter | channel | guild to send it to a specific window.

Tells are sent to what ever window you set it to, regardless of who you
receive them from. With the new changes, unless you turn it off, tells go to
a new window.
