Oh, but wait.  The only reasons to report someone for a "violation" of a naming
policy is because it hurts your ability to roleplay or you like being the Nazi
of EQ.

If it is because of your ability to roleplay, then apparently you think in RL
people have names floating above their heads.  Yes, I do seem to recall seeing
"Ronald BurgerFlipper" floating over the drive-thru idiot at McDonald's.  And
yes, I also seem to recall seeing "Bonds HR King" floating above the head of a
prominent San Francisco outfielder as I watched ESPN.

If it's because you like being a Nazi, you have my pity.  People should feel
sorry for you and not argue with you so much, it may hurt your self-esteem and
one day we will see you standing on a street corner writing down names of
people who don't come to a complete stop at a stop sign...or do you already do
that?
