Agreed...apart from a wizard :)

In cobalt scar:

i too did wyverns to 55.  51 to 55 took me a week and a half (played a lot
*gasp*)

55 i started on the vendor camp quadding Othmir.  Without harmony at that
level it was the only camp i could pull and they do not spawn fast enough
sadly so i moved to raptors.

So from then...

55 - 2 days
56 - 2 days
57 - just started the exp at raptors seems just as fast as at 56... however
i am thinking of moving back to Cobalt Scar to do Othmir again...now that i
am high enough level to pull the other two camps without Harmony....will be
interesting to see how the exp compares to raptors.

FYI at raptors in level 56 i was getting 1 blue for every 4 quads.  Each
quad taking me down to about 40 -50% mana With Epic/Familiar for mana regen
(about the same as clarity) the downtime was minimal.  at 56 i had the
ability to take 4 raptors on the large island...then take the other 4 before
the first set respawned.... the experience was astonishing.
