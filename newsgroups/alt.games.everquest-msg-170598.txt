The mere creation of the department is not a problem, as there _is_ a need
for better security.  Unfortunately, Bush isn't willing to do what really
needs to be done to protect the country.  Instead of dealing with protecting
our borders, he's shifting the burden onto the backs of the American
citizens.  This isn't very conservative.

Not very conservative.  It's an expansion of government into the lives of
citizens.  That includes the war on drugs.

Not how they also have some hefty resistance from the right.

Which side has been the most activist with the social workers?  Which side
has tried to outlaw corpral punishment?  Which side has endorsed handing out
condemns in high schools, regardless of what the parents want?  If you want
to see the government dictate how you raise your children, look to the left,
that's their forte.

Judges should be prohibited.  That's what legislators are for.  The Florida
Supreme Court already had a hard enough time ruling on the law as it was,
without actually giving them license to re-write it at will.

The left is just as quick with the call to censorship.  Campaign Finance
reform is a good example of that, and I will hold that against Bush until he
leaves the White House in '08.  Also, the left enjoys

So we are at an impass.  The difference is, you're claiming victory where
there is none.

It's a matter of the issue that was at hand.  The souce of the man's pride
was his wealth.  Indeed, it would be difficult for a rich man to enter into
Heaven if his wealth made him prideful.  But, as a camel can kneel to enter
into the city, a wealthy man can accept humility and enter into Heaven.  The
money must mean less to him than God.

I have absolutely no idea what you just said.
