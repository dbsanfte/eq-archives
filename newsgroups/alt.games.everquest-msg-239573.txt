   I'm not trying to slam you Mike, I really do find this whole thing
interesting.  How many EQ accounts have you bought?  Are you _sure_ that this
compulsion of yours is cheaper than a therapist?

   At least you're interesting and consistent.  To my way of thinking, that's
less embarrassing than some of the posting types we get around here.

   Actually, maybe you should give away your account when you quit.  To a
trusted friend if you have one, or failing that to a long standing fairly sane
person from this newsgroup.  Someone that would give the account back to you
when you change your mind again, so you don't keep buying account after
account.  It is a bit risky to do this, of course, but since you don't seem to
have any high level characters or uber gear, it isn't that big of a deal, I
should think.  And no, I'm not trying to fish for you to give me one.

   Of course, your "just give up and give in to the compulsion" track might be
the right one as well, if you do indeed stick with it.
