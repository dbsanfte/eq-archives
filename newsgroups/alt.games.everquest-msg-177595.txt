Actually it does help the tanks.  DA/DB in effect drops you to the
bottom of the hate list until it wears off (the mob doesn't forget
you, but if there's another target handy it cheerfully beats on it
while you're invulnerable), so if the tanks have any hate at all
the mob will turn on them allowing you to back off a bit while they
build up agro.

Hopefully a tank will have surpassed the Cleric's accumulated hate
(which decays over time, helping the process a little) by the time
DA/DB wears off.  The Cleric can help this by backing off some to
make sure the tank(s) have a bigger proximity mod when DA/DB drops.

The Cleric doesn't need to outrun the mob to the zone (assuming it
doesn't summon), he just needs to get a good headstart on a tank.
