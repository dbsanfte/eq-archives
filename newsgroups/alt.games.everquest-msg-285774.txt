I and my son got together and are playing a shaman/mage duo.  This 
combination works pretty well, as I have a good set of buffs for his 
pet, and can give us both SOW, and slow our target.  Temp is readily 
available in POK, while there's no similar high end shaman buff that 
will stick to lowbies, so the buffs I'm providing are more useful than 
those of a cleric partner would be.

His pets and his nukes do much better damage than I do but I currently 
make a better "tank", with his DS and a potion DS on, I can stand there 
and soak up the hits and keep myself healed while he and his pet do much 
of the damage.  If we get an add, his pet can offtank one, our DPS drops 
a bunch but he has the nuke power to take one of the mobs down fast and 
let us regroup.

I just hit 32, which means I get a pet as well, yet another DPS and 
potential offtank.  His DPS continues to climb and leave mine in the 
dust, but thats the way the partnership is designed.

This also means we do very well with pretty much any partners up to a 
full group, with the exception of another shaman which doesn't add so 
much to the group.  Additional mages do stack well though.

This is far from the only viable combo out there, but it is an option 
we've been pretty happy with, and one I can see lasting up thru the levels.
