We dont have a big lead on anybody man.  On the odd occasions ive bothered
to parse (potime or qvic named) the top 1 is always a rogue (usually top 2,
but not guranteed) and the rest of the top 5 varies between rogue, monk and
ranger.  Yes, we have some rangers who beat some monks on parses (but the
names are different each time).  Thats including all nukes, proc damage,
criticals etc.  Doesnt include casters though.

Monk lull wasnt supposed to be unresistable. It was bugged in its initial
state, and when they said it would soon be fixed (nerfed) people shrieked!

Or you can kite the add while the group kills the other one.  FD splitting
can be a slow process if the luck doesnt go your way...

On the same timer, for shorter duration, with far less utility.  Id happily
give you voidance and whirlwhind, for weaponshield.

We have "damage enhancing" discs. Just like rangers do with TS.

Downright untrue.

In my experiences people would take the ranger, 9 times in 10. LFG, no
groups, no progress is why I started leveling alts on different accounts in
the first place. So that i wasn't reliant on LFG and other people.  Now I
don't need other people to exp, but I do need to lug my shaman as a minimum
around anywhere i go.

> Beastlord? Grossly superior dps, mana regen? Gimme the BL.

Yeah well they need nerfing hah. I dont see the top beast parse ever beating
the top ranger parse (and our beast/SK's are usually amongst the lowest on
raid parses)

f druids. ranger any time.

chanter bot is just needed at the adventure camp. ranger anytime!

Dunno about better offtank. my 65 mage pets go down pretty fast

Necro dps is reliant on mobs living long enough for their dots to be cast
and do their damage.. and is also incredible agro, requiring a very strong
agro tank

> Paladin? Better heals, tanking, ghetto rez.. gimme paladin

If i was looking for a ranger it would be to fill a dps role. For that
reason alone, suggesting a paladin instead is laughable.

Shaman anyday yes. For a different role.

Not even close dps. Id take a bard before a paladin or SK for dps..

If im looking for a ranger, i already have a tank.. so no, id take the
ranger with his dps buffs and utilities over a warrior

I often prefer melee dps over casters, because the group is a bit more meaty
and resillient... but hey, what class can compare to a wizard for dps?

f druids. id take a ranger over SK and necro. F bard snare.

Lull is capped too. Harmony is faster than feign pulling, pet pulling,
snare/root fding etc.

Demerix and Darkglint drop before and after uqua... thats a huge difference
in difficulty.
I have demerix and i don't leave our rangers for dust. Like i said, the top
5 is a pretty mixed bunch of classes

That applies to many classes, and rangers are certainly not the most
affected by this problem.
