DOH!

/grumble

And after all the months we talked about that here. Yep, my OS CD
reinstalled DirectX 6.1.

/sigh

Move along. Nothing to see here.

The rest of the problem was a "helper application" that IBM gave me. It
did, in fact, find some items that were not attached with the proper
drivers, but it also managed to slice an unspecified 8 meg partition off
my second hard drive for reasons unknown.

Look to be in good shape now, and logged in successfully last night
after a twenty minute patch and copying over all my log, ini, and other
files. Back in business. Thanks.
