I gotta agree the Ranger brings a lot to the table that completes the
Duo where as the Pally is too much like the cleric. Plus a lot of the
equipment the pally is using prob works on the ranger also. If you
enjoy the Pally you will love the Ranger, very alike in many respects.
Go with the Ranger and see what I mean.
