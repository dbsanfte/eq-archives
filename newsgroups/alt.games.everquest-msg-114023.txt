I can't find the level 20 Wizard spell "Force Shock" in Felwithe
casters guild, even though castersrealm states it is sold in Felwithe.
Actually, I couldn't find any DD spells higher than level 12 in
Felwithe. What's up with that? Can anyone tell me where I can buy this
spell.

Also, does anyone know why most Wizard spells are not even for sale in
the Wizard guild in Felwithe?

Thanks for any help.
