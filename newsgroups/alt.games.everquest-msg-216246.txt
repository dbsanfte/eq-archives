On the contrary, pretty much every pathing or AI change that has happened
has been mentioned in the patch message.

Of course, Sony loves to keep their air of idiocy and/or malevolence, so
often they say one thing and do something completely different, but they
*do* mention it.

Have you even *played* in LDoN yet?  The dungeons are single halls.  Of
course I run precisely the same route every time I go through a LDoN
dungeon, there isn't any other route to choose.  :P

My guildleader will be sending me tells that I'm pulling too slow.  :)  You
see, I am in an entire guild of balls-to-the-wall'ers.

Actually, I know pretty well.  I know how approximately how much more mana
my guild clerics have over my twink, and I know approximately how much more
mana my twink has than an average and a poorly geared cleric.  The margins
aren't so huge, and are easily taken into consideration.  Hell, I know how
much healing the cleric did before they say "20m" so if I didn't have *any*
prior experience with clerics I could still make a fairly accurate
estimation.

Not in an LDoN dungeon, no...

Of course I have.  Utterly impossible to predict, so you deal with it when
it happens.  If it's the cleric going LD there isn't any amount of
preparation that will let you deal with it anyway, so again, preparing is
futile, and 99 times out of 100 needless.

> or Virtue on the MT drop midfight?

Yeah...  so?  It'd have to be a pretty poor cleric *and* a pretty poor tank
for that to become an issue.

> A runner resist snare?

How's this for a concept?  Snare the mob before it becomes a runner.

> Had a POP mob resist slow a time or two, 

In a LDoN dungeon?  Neat.

> Only idiots do not leave themselves a reserve of mana for contigencies.

Only idiots think that they need a full tank in reserve for every fight.

I'm not running any risk of wiping.  A cleric at 20% mana is good for a
three mob pull with plenty of reserve in LDoN, and that's if all three mobs
are being tanked.

And I can point out caster mobs (in particular) in most of those places
where any level advantage is more than offset by watching the magician's pet
go charging out of camp on an intercept course for the mob that just nuked
the pulling magician.  /pet hold?  Magician needs to stop slumming with the
lowbies.

Ahh, and you assumed that the magician would be able to cast sow indoors...

I think that may be the silliest statement made in this whole thread.  :P

Yeah, my methods invite ruin in this world of yours where magicians cast sow
indoors while slumming, clerics panic unless they start every fight with a
nearly full tank, nobody bothers to snare until the mob is already running
down the hall, and you encounter PoP mobs in LDoN dungeons.

In this reality, though, my methods work quite well.  :)
