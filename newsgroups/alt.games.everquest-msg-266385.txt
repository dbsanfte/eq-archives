Ever hear of cyclosporin?

If you should ever need an organ transplant, be glad the Hardanger
plateau in Norway was never strip mined or otherwise altered.

And there are numerous similar examples from other old growth
ecosystems. You never know when you wipe out something that might have
saved the life of you or one of your children.

A forest is not a forest. I come from an island that was cut clean in
the literal sense in the 16th to 18th century, to provide lumber for
ships. In the 1940s and 50s, people decided reforestation would be
nice, and planted spruce everywhere. So now we do have clusters of
spruce forest, but almost nothing grows on the ground beneath them
because they're too dense and their needles acidify the soil.
