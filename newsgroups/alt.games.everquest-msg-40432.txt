Druids are the perfect class if you like helping people... Buffs, Heals
and Ports will make someone's day if they are in trouble, or bound in
the wrong place for CR. Of course, the problem is, your kindness *will*
be taken for granted, and most people won't be as gracious about it as
you. Mostly you'll come across:

sow plz
HEAL ME!1!!
dude can u port?
buff plz
can u come to bb 2 pick up my alt im lvl 2 i dont have any pp but plz?
PLZ? WTF? U SUKK!!!

Having said that, the most fun I've had in the game so far was through
one of those random /tells, helping a Rogue do an involved Wizard quest.
I was little more than a taxi and buff-o-matic, but it still was a lot
of fun, and a break from the routine.
