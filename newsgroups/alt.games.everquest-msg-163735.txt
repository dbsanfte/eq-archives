Damnit, Verant hates pallies.

Though, given Precia's hit rate last night (one hit in seven swings,
average), I imagine she just gives up when I'm not watching.  It's sad when
the majority of your damage to a blue mob comes from casting, and you still
end up with one health bubble left (and one and a half mana bubbles).  It's
even worse when you're a paladin, and it's an undead mob.

And people wonder why I say paladins are seriously underpowered.
