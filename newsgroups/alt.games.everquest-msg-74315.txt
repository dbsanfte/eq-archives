No, but I can go to a Navy Federal in Jacksonville, and expect them to have
the money I deposited in Norfolk.  Of course, they wouldn't have what's in
my safe deposit box, but I could still make a withdrawl or deposit.

Personally, I'm glad I can retrieve stuff from any bank.  Maybe not as
realistic, but less of a pain in the arse.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
