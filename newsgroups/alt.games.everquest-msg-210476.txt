Get this for the 5hp regen or just drop about the same cash for Tae Ew
Chain.  (45 AC and a bunch of very nice stats.)  Only thing is I dont
know if the Tae Ew has a recommended/required level on it.

...has a recommended level of 40 on it.  Get a Silver Chitin Wristband
instead.  If you have some friends around level 45 or up that can help
you farm Wakening Lands for a few hours, get the Ice Forged Shackles. 
If you can find a deal or want to spend your item limit you can try to
pick up a Bracelet of Fortitude.

> Leggings of the spiritcharmer,0.5k

Never seen these...but I'm guessing if they also drop in LoY, they
will have a recommended level as well.  Cheap: Ry'Gor chain leggings. 
Expensive: Any of the Dragonleg line.  (Worst --> Best: Worked,
Reinforced, Heavy, Peerless, Matchless.  i.e. Worked Dragonleg
Breeches)  If you do go for dragonleg breeches, shop around.  They
vary in price a *lot* and you will see one moron selling a crappier
version, like Reinforced Dragonleg (22ac, 9 dex, 5 sta) for twice as
much as someone else is selling the Heavy Dragonleg Breaches (23 ac,
10 dex, 6 sta).  This line is very nice for rangers as it provides
excellent AC with good additions to our two favorite stats.

> You got nice weapons,

When you hit level 20, get a wurmslayer (you are damaged capped until
then).  Keep it until you hit about level 50.

Also look in to a weighty polearm if you just want to practice but
also provide a little more DPS.  It has a higher yet still reasonably
low delay, and a much better ratio.  (Lower delay = faster skillups)

Yes but you may want a bow just for stats (if you are really in to
stats).  You can probably pick up a Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt for
7k.  (Recommended level, but only level 20)

Rings: Velium Fire Wedding Ring x2 (6 ac and +65 HP).  There are
better rings but they are all fairly new to the game so they have
non-twink recommended/required level restrictions)

Cloak: My favorite is the Tigeraptor cloak for the price.

Arms: Hardened Grey Flesh Sleaves go for 5-7k.  Very nice for a
ranger.  You can also look in to Tolan's Vambraces, but until you can
use them (level 45) they may as well just be a high-ac piece of
banded.  They have no stats, and 18ac.

Earring:  Hmmm, if you would sacrifice the stats for the flowing
though, the Earring of the Solstice should still provide FT 1 at level
1.  (I think)  You would basically just have a 1ac, 1 sta, 1 wis, 1
int, ~10HP, ~10 mana, crap saves earring but you would also have
increased mana regeneration...which would be very nice at your level. 
Also, get a Vah Shir claw earring.

Neck: Spider fur is cheap and nice for the price.
