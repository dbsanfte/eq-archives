Just noticed something (though its fairly obvious).
An easy way to do it is Level/10 is the amount of HP's 1 stamina gives at
that level.

So an easy comparison between 2 items would be.
6 AC 20HP
6 AC 5Sta
at level 40 those items are equal.
But at level 42 the 6AC 5Sta item produces me an extra hitpoint.  I wonder
if VI rounds up or down on something like this.
