Most ppl buy games cause they are new, then suffer performance and buy
hardware. nVidia has been involved with development of EQ2 see the
interviews wich were available on EQLive. So there is some interest from
hardware industry towards gamedesigners on one side, on the other side new
hardware allows new techniques and puts the standards up higher. And a game
is judged by sounds graphics feeling, gameplay etc. now a game can feel
excellent and gameplay can be awesome but if sound and graphics are not
good, the average score of game in review drops and has lousy sales. So
pressure on software innovation and game artwork is enormous wich translates
itself as demands on hardware. (still sometimes i long for the good old
games and nowadays crappy graphics of my old C=64 games is it a sign i'm
getting too old?)
