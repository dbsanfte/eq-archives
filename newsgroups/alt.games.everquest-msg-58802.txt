Its not rude, just wrong. It is better to bottom post
because people read left to right and top to bottom.
If everyone top posted then everyone has to scroll down
read the bottom and then scroll back to the top to read
the answer. Seems pretty simple to me.

I'd rather just scroll down once, rather than scroll down
and then back up. Why make more work for your self
or the reader?
