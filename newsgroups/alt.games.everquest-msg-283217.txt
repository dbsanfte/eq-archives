"Due to the increased costs of operating the game service for the games 
included in the Station Access subscription package, we will be increasing 
our subscription rates in June. Effective June 1, 2006, the new monthly 
subscription rate will be $24.99/month"

Anyway WoW is 12.99 a month. Sony greed>all. If you think EQ is worth twice 
the monthly fee then you're a sucker.
I wont even begin on the price of server transfers.
And people wonder why so many wont be touching Vanguard now. duh.
