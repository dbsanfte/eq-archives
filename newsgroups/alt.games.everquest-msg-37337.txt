that it becomes STATIC.

There is no reason why you can't do both though. If you've been 
in the 50 plus game you do see that things become very static since
you are NOT going to be enjoying raiding new areas and such unless
you are in a SUPER DUPER UPER MEGA UBER GUILD. The reason
why I insert so many goofy adjectives there is that a plain Uber guild
won't cut it. A plain uber guild, as mine did, will get stuck in the
rut of doing the same planes and dragon encounters over.. and over..
and over.. and over again forever. These are kind of new the first or
second time then get old hat. I bet sleepers or TOV or such are old
hat for super duper uber guilds like FOH and what not now, to them
they are the equivalent of the orc camps in the east commons.

Actually you've kind of missed something though, no lower level people
who are of an appropriate level to do droga raid it.. EVER. That one
person on my server who camps the idol of the thorned is CERTAINLY
not preventing them from doing the dungeon either. No one does it
because of the risk involved who is of an appropriate level to do it,
ever.

That is true yes. CoM is a nightmare zone too where even a 50's level
group or two can get totally wiped out.

I don't think anti farming code is the answer though. In case you did
not notice, if you went into the warrens like last week or the week
before that on the live servers you probably saw no one in the zone,
maybe one or two very low eruds who could only do the entrance kobolds
if even that. The Anti farming code was put in that zone but due to
where that zone is it was a total waste. No one bothers to go there it
is so dang far out in the boonies and ESPECIALLY when it has anti
farming code. Sometimes you get bored at high levels, it is going to
happen. When that happens my druid might feel like going to the
warrens at 2 am (my druid is level 55) and kill mugglewump to see if
it drops that one actually good holdable that is like 3 ac and some
wis. That holdable could argueably be pretty dang good for a druid or
cleric up until a pretty high level (since it can be used in the
primary hand) Maybe i'd sell it or use it on another character, but
the point is that I should have the freedom to do so when the zone is
completely empty.

Right NOW stonebrunt is crowded because its new, with many players of
an appropriate level ( as was the warrens at first) However, Mark my
words, just like the warrens in 5 months stonebrunt will be a
ghostland yet my druid or some other character just figuring on
raising faction with quests (trivial) or getting a couple items
(trivial) will have no reason to go there either when otherwise they
WOULD. Check out the revamped kerra ridge for yet another zone that is
totally empty nearly 24/7 since they removed mitty as being the gold
ring dropper (which was the only reason anyone was there before) Its
the area. Tox is a black hole on the EQ landscape which no one goes to
unless they are high enough level to do the hole. Verant compares
stonebrunt to lake of ill omen, but they miss why lake of ill omen is
so popular .. its geography. Lake of ill is near a city which is
pretty good, its very near for iksars especially, and its a gateway
earlier zone to some other good ones like FM and overthere. 
Stonebrunt is still way the hell over on the otherside of the world
and one DANG long trip unless you are getting a port since most people
wanting to go there or to the warrens would not want to be doing the
qeynos area also. 

Unless you are getting a port, Lake of ill omen is even closer to
butcher and EVEN freeport than the toxula area is to freeport. Trivial
loot code is a poor band aid solution to the real problem and putting
it in areas which will be very underused eventually is both gutless
and backwards assed. They could have put trivial loot code in the high
traffic areas where the problem existed in the first place such as
droga (but not a huge issue there since no one low enough would be
going on a raid to get that thing, I agree) or somewhere like solb and
lower guk. They'd be scared to upset what players have come to
know as the status quo. I tend to think of a band-aid fix to the real
problem, which is staticness and camp centric design to just not be
the best solution in any event. 

The real problem is not that someone who won't get xp from X creature
is camping it for an item keeping 4 guys who ARE of a level to get xp
from camping it (and really from what I've seen that happens a lot
more rarely than pro trivial combat code people make out) but that ANY
of them are camping X creature because they know it drops X item. That
old underlying design is at fault, not the players themselves. Trivial
code is a way of saying "shame on you!" when they are really the ones
who made the problem (they being verant) In fact verant's entire
static design ENCOURAGES the behavior that some see as bad.
