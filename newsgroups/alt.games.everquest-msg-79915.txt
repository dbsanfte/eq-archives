Ok, I've got a 50 Cleric, but  i am "Not" rolling in the dough.... Id
like to aquire some stuff for this fun little bugger.  Id rather move
my Happy High Elf Cleric but out to find any items you can recommend
for the Rogue.......
I have all Expansions so I can go to most zones, I can get some backup
but am not looking to need a full group to aquire the items.

Your time is appreciated...
