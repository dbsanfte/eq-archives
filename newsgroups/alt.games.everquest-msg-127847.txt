Of course.  However, I was referring to the original poster's prescription
that all need to go to websites to find information before they are entitled
to a spawn that the original poster wanted.

Please refer to the original post.  He is advocating just that (perhaps
"mandate" is an inappropriate word here, but he offers no other options in
his rant).

I purposely did not post about the KS part.  That word is quite overused and
to some people it means taking a spawn someone called for in a camp check.
He did not provide details on this because it wasn't the main point of his
post.  If he engaged a monster first and the other guild picked it off, that
is indeed a punishible offense.

However, the simple fact that someone doesn't know what to do with something
he or she loots is not a crime.

So?  Many people completed epics before complete walkthroughs were posted on
the web.

Now *you're* rephrasing his exact claim that people who are "more informed"
are more entitled !   :-)

The point of my short post was that there is another way to play and many
people I know choose to play without the aid of spoilers.  I respect that,
as I mentioned I respected those who like the websites.  It's a matter of
choice.  Let others choose to play how they wish without being, as you said,
"annoyed" with them.

Okay, I can't let this slide!  Who recoiled in horror?  I'm just saying
there are other ways to play.  Don't try to exaggerate me into something I'm
not.  I like to stick to those guidelines where possible, but when I'm
stuck, I do come here and to a few choice sites (i.e., Trader's Corner,
Lokari's Tailoring).  I understand your getting caught up in a huff, but
hang on, I'm just saying the original poster's main idea, that outside
research needs to be done (and that *was* his main idea), was intolerant of
the way others like to play the game.  It's a matter of choice.  Please
don't be annoyed at players who choose differently than you.
