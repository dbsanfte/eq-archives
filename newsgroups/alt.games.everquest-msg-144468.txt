Ykesha is a pretty good proc (which is why it's on about 8 diff weapons!)
and is hard to beat before lvl 50.

Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies
(1hs 6/22... procs Spirit Strike - 81 DD, Cold based... from lvl 20)
Lower delay than Yak, so more opportunities to go off... and the proc isn't
all-or-nothing, so at least some of it will get thru a resist.

Polished Granite Tomahawk
(1hs 6/26... procs Berserker Strength - +20 Str, -15 Agl, adds 30 pts of
Damage Absorbtion... from lvl 20)
Nice off-hander for low to mid level soloers... mainly for the damage
avoidance

Stiletto of the Bloodclaw
(piercing 6/23... procs Bloodclaw - 20pt + 2 x 15pt poison DoT, total of
50... from level 18)
Not spectacular damage, but the poison seems to be resisted less

Serrated Bone Dirk
(piercing 8/27... procs Engulfing Darkness - 10 x 11pt Dot, -40% move
penalty... from lvl 27)
2 procs for the price of one... nice damage, if a little slow to work... and
the snare means less chance of a runner rejoining his buddies (certain death
for most soloers)

There's prolly a few more, but I'm tired and can't think of any off the top
of my head :o)
