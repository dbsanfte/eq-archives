For us non-raiders, there's always the focus items. My first high-end
LDoN armor purchase wasn't class armor but a 75hp mask and a spell
haste 4 focus item to go with it (both from Ruj).

I used to set up quite a few LDoNs and whenever more than one person
had a preference as to theme, we'd just let the people /random and the
winner got to pick. Nobody ever had a problem with that although you
would get the occasional person that wouldn't join unless we went to a
specific theme. Which I never saw as a problem since those people were
always up front about it when you invited them if they didn't already
have it in their LFG description. 

Strangely enough, doing it that way means I've ended up having by far
the least number of wins in MMC, which seems to be the preferred
dungeon for most people but almost never got picked by the 65s that I
grouped with.  I've maxed (or close) EF, Tak and Ruj but barely have
10 wins in MMC. 

Personally, I'm glad that they decided to do it that way, at least it
gets people into all of the dungeons. It's bad enough now where if you
do a LDoN Hard, it always seems to be in the same two themes. The Monk
wants to pull EF, Bard wants to pull Ruj. ... but that's pullers
choice and I wouldn't ever try to dictate themes to the puller on a
hard.
