Or however the hell you spell his name. And if you know who I mean, I
dont' have to tell you why we're camping *this* asshole.
*sigh*

Ok, I've talked to far too many people in my guild about this, and read
up from various sources online. We camped this bastard for five hours
last night, and no sign of him. I've done much longer camps, and I know
he can be an annoyingly rare spawn, but I'd like to know that I'm at
*least* in the right spot in case he does decide to show his slimey
face.

We went off the docks in Lake Rath, straight out, and down into the
tunnel. We came upon a tower. There were four deepwater gobbies outside
on guard at the corners, and two aqua gobs inside on the ground floor.
On the second floor were three deepwaters. Those were the ones I was
killing. Supposedly LB would spawn in the center slot. The outside ones
could be placeholders for the tainted for the Druid epic. Now for the
issues and questions:

On source said that Lord B spawned "next to Deep". Deep was on track for
a while, somewhere near the zone line, but we never saw her. Having
never been down here before, no clue where she's *supposed* to be and it
makes me wonder if I'm in the right spot.

Several sources said that the outside two spawns (along with other
gobbies in the tower) were on a six minute time, but LB's spawn spot was
on a 28 muinute timer. The center one *was* a longer timer than the
outside ones, but it was about fifteen minutes each time. Again, making
me wonder if I was even in the right place.

The tainted did spawn twice in the left hand spawn point (left as you
look at these three from the front) but each time I pulled it to our
camp, killed it, and the corrupted did not spawn. Is this normal,
broken, or am I in the wrong spot (again) and this is a "trick" version
of the corrupted?

Any help from anybody who's done, or helped with, this part of the
cleric epic most appreciated. I'll camp it for Tiru as long as it takes,
but I would like to know if I'm in the right spot.
