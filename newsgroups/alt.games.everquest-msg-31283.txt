heh, not a bad idea, my HP bar isn't located in the group cluster, and
I"m also watching my target bar, as I'm using /target (main assist) and
so forth to flip thru some people not in my group.  More than once
I've had someone send me a quick tell "Bergh heal yourself" just in the
nick of time.   Word of Healing time!

Depending on level, HP buffs, and HP items, Mod to a sliver and Cheal
may be more efficient, or Mod/celestial may be better.  Mod/Celestial
is less scary, too, as you can mod a bit, celestial, and then mod some
more while the heal is still working.  Finally, you can never end up
FM and FH with the mod/Cheal trick, since the CHeal will eat its massive
chunk of mana =after= you used the rods.

The trick to Mod to a sliver, by the way, is to use the Mods in your
inventory screen where you can see your actual HP numbers, the
"to a sliver" thing is misleading.  Thats "to under 225," using the
HP bar as a guide is just asking for Mod Death.

More often than not when I'm doing mass Mods, I'm doing a
total raid wipeout.  This means that neither Cheal nor Celestial
are being used... its Sheal at best, since its the non-clerics
pouring their mana out keeping me healed.  Rather than
"down to a sliver" I go "up to FM", and I usually don't have
any HP buffs up at all, since I'm usually dead too.  Still have
yet to master that "camp out" manuever.

If I'm just resing the mage, then I don't need the full span of
mana that Mod to a sliver would give me, I use enough to
make up what I spent, Celestial and make that up too, and
the rest of the pile are for the mage (who also gets Reso
and Celestial, so he has about 50M and full health when
alls said and done.
