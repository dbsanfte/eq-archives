Hi, I just logged on to a new server (new to me anyway) and created an Iksar
Monk, I have never played one before, and have just finished the leech husk
quest.  I was wondering where to get pebbles for the next quest.  In the
process of doing the first quest I aquired some Froglok tongues, I know
they're a quest item, yet have no clue who wants them.  Any help is much
appreciated.

The first step towards failure is to try.  Therefore if someone has never
failed, they have never tried.
