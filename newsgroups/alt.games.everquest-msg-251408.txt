LDoN is a mixed bag for soloers.  It does draw groups into the
dungeons, which leaves other areas more available.  And it added
the Magus-ports, which provide new shortcuts for getting where
you want to solo.  It did make a mess of some popular hunting
areas by putting the camps there, but by the same token those
bored people sometimes help when a low level character gets in
over her head. :)

On the other hand, some of the "little" changes recently have
been GREAT for soloers.  The biggest far and away was the change
in regen.  Even standing, my Iksar Monk regens a lot better than
he used to; and sitting, all my characters heal up amazingly
quickly.  That plus bandaging up to 70% really reduced the down
time for any soloer.
