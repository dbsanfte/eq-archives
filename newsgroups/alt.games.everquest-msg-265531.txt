Well gee 42, I didn't realize that the whole online gaming universe
revolved around YOUR needs and desires.

Newflash sparky, we don't give the slightest damn what you "think" is
kill stealing, if that's not what the rules and conventions of THIS GAME
say is kill stealing.

This isn't EQ, leave your EQ baggage at the door.

ME: "The problem here is that the term kill stealing arose from a system
where ALL the exp went to the one that landed the killing blow."

YOU: "EQ awards xp to the person that does the *most* attributed damage.
The killing blow is entirely irrelevant. I can't beleive you are
debating this when you are wrong on such fundamental mechanics."

Talk about a deliberate red herring on your part, since YOU AND ONLY YOU
are fixated on EQ.

Really showing your EQ bias there 42.

And here's the crux:  Player convention ON EQ.

Player conventions are NOT UNIVERSAL, they vary from game to game.
You are expecting EQ conventions and EQ definitions in a game that is
NOT EQ.

As mentioned by another poster, the only "recognized" kill stealing is
someone attacking a mob that they can get no experience from, that is
already being fought by a player that can get exp from it.

Every other anti-social behavior is covered under harassment

No, because they don't have to listen to it if they don't want to.
You can't force someone in COH to listen to you.

Your knowledge of CoH seems to be _EXTREMELY_ limited since you
apparently don't know this.

>What if you are hunting where I want to hunt? Isn't that infringing on 
>another players enjoyment of the game?

Since you can't OWN a mob or an area, this is irrelevant, all
non-mission areas are by definition OPEN TO ALL PLAYERS.
You can team, you can solo and as long as you aren't interfering with
other players all is golden.


>What if I decide to share the mobs whether you want to share them or 
>not. Should I petition you for infringing on my enjoyment of the game, 
>or will you be petitioning me for infringing on yours.

Depends on whether you're attacking things i'm already fighting.
While there's no "kill stealing", doing so repeatedly to another player
is harassment.

>Obviously such a ridiculous notion of harassment as this is something 
>you must have plucked out thin air. Nobody half sane would suggest such 
>a ridiculously vague policy.

In short, you want them to do things like EQ.
Guess what, they won't and only the ex/current EQ players want that
anyway.

New game, new rules, learn them.

What the fuck are you on about?

A GM tells KDragon there's no kill stealing - no mention of conventions
at all.
Support tells KDragon that since he's not a customer they can't process
his complaint.  Once again no mention of conventions at all.

Your talk of conventions is a red herring to this whole discussion,
especially so since you are talking about EQ conventions.

Since you still don't seem to get it, i'll say it again; THIS ISN'T EQ.

>If something becomes a convention, its often because its a good idea. 
>Maybe it even should be a rule. Maybe someone should look into that...

Maybe it's because that convention WAS NEEDED in a particular case in a
particular game.
Your EQ conventions don't fit except on EQ and any game that has
INDENTICAL game play, mechanics and game rules.

Newflash, that isn't the case with CoH.

Conventions in CoH ON'T SUPPORT ownership.

Christ talking to you is like banging my head on the wall.

The conventions you are talking about are EQ conventions, not CoH
conventions.

You're like an American who goes to Britain and insists on driving on
the right hand side of the road.

Your EQ rules, mechanics and conventions are irrelevant since this IS
NOT EQ.  

Got that yet, *THIS* *IS* *NOT* *EQ*, *THIS* *IS* *COH*.

Learn the rules and conventions of THIS GAME instead of trying to force
everyone else to follow rules and conventions created for a completely
different game and gaming world.

Those people who didn't come from EQ (likely the majority of CoH
players) neither know nor care about how you did things on EQ.
