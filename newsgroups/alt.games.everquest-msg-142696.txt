Would I pay someone 1pp to relieve me of the weight of the 1000cp I'm
hauling around? You bet I would. So, why not just destroy the 1000cp
and be done with it? 1000sp is a little different depending on
circumstances, but a couple hundred sp and thousands of cp are
expendable anytime to become unencumbered or even just able to move
again.  :)

Of course I would always invest in food/drink/bandages/reagents first
if possible.
