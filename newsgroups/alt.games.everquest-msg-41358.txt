How does it feel, Drake, knowing your only claim to fame on usenet (and most
likely anywhere else) is riding bizbee's coattails like some kind of bloated
tick?  If you're doing it because you disagree with him, say that you
disagree with him.  I disagree with his post here, at least partially, but I
do it without trying to convince everyone he's a subhuman guttersnipe.  If
you're doing it because he called you an ignorant fuck once, guess what?
According to everything I've ever observed about you, YOU ARE.  And the
answer isn't to keep attacking him; by now, you must have observed that it
has no effect.  The answer is to stop being an ignorant fuck.

/em is still humping Drake's leg, but can't remember why
