OK  Just reached Level 16 as a Necro.  Does Shieldskin stop working
after 55 cumulative HP are reached or does it absorb the first 55
points for each hit?

For example,  I'm fighting a monster that does 40 points of damage per
hit. Am I safe only for it's first hit and then 15 points for the
second hit,  or am I safe for every hit the monster does till
shiledskin wears off on its own?

Thanks for answers!
