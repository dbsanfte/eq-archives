So how high level do you want it?
I know of a druid guildie who soloes in Umbral Plains to get his
better-then-HoT-gear. He has equipment that flat dwarfs my best pieces of
hard earned Quest armor (Thurg) and I need a raid force to get mine whereas
he can SOLO his ubergear dropping mobs.

Plus a good druid quadding can easy do a level every couple of days above
lvl 50 (all the way to lvl 60) and even faster for levels up to 50.

Now think twice before asking for increased druid grouping powers (saw the
post... a better dot for druids, wtf? being second nuker surpassing mages
and second dotter surpassing shammies isn't enough? And what's up with the
bad healing? it's like a chanter asking for wizard or mage nukes next to
it's normal set of spells).


And to think us mages humbly asked for higher level pets so we can actually
hit stuff around our level even at the expense of more mana cost, increased
component cost or increased casting times.

/em feels good about blowing off some steam.
/em hopes VI will hurry up with their caster balance.
