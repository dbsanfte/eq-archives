The ooc channel is for out of character communication, left open for 
anyone to participate in.  Just because the conversation was only between 
two people doesn't mean they were SPAMMING the zone.  Perhaps you don't

Who is to say you give a crap about any other out of character comments 
someone might make.  Ignore them or turn off the channel if it's too much 
for you.
