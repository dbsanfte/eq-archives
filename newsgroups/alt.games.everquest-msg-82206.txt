That's correct, but that's not what I'm saying to do.

Well, you could, but it would be silly.  I would just run to the spire, 
wait until the one minute warning, wait another minute until it says:
	The spires to luclin are now active
and then drop invis, hail, and say, 'journey to luclin'.  He will hand the 
shard over, then you wait a few more seconds and port out.  You have about 
20 seconds from when they say the spires are active until they fire.
