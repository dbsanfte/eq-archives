Twice I've gotten something called the "Potion of Sustenance" from General
Jyleel (spelling?) in Felwithe by giving him an Illegible Scroll. I've tried
drinking it, can't seem to do that. I've tried equipping it, can't seem to
do that. I've looked online in various databases for what it might be and
what it might be for, no luck.

Can anybody tell me what it is and what to do with it? When I first got it,
I assumed it was a potion for renewing stamina, but that's only a guess. If
so, I woould have thought it was drinkable, but I can't seem to do that.

I'm baffled. Can anybody help?

Thanks.
