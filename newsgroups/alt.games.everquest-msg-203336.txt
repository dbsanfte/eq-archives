Well we know how much PR info can be fluff, but in the Gamespy
interview:

http://www.gamespy.com/interviews/june03/eqldonpc/

GameSpy: Will this be the last expansion we'll see for EverQuest? 

Shawn Lord: No. In fact, we already have plans for another expansion,
though the details on that one aren't ready for release yet. The story
of Lost Dungeons will be one chapter in many still to come.

Looks like they gunna milk this cash cow for quite some time.

also looks like its gunna be a download for this one as well
Damn... I just read that, and cannot find the spot where I read it...
was like 24.95 for download and 29.99 for getting the CD.

o well I am sure I read it, unless it was one of those flash
backs....???
