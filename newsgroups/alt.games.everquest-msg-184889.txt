Well, I played a (mostly) raiding level 60 cleric pre-Luclin and if I was 
in pick-up groups (rare) I almost never recovered the money spent on 
peridots unless it was a safe enough environment to use the group-Aego 
instead of the individual one. Fortunately for me, I almost never did 
pickup groups and my guildies/friends always made sure I was covered one 
way or another. On average I spent 5k-10k per week on peridots, just as 
an FYI.

Depending on the situation, they don't always need a pet either.

> Enchanters spend Gems on Runes

Again, with a good cleric, not needed, but I often gave up peridots to 
enchanters to help save their hides.

Every single time I gave. I usually contributed a 10 stack to the Mage.

The "uber" guilds I have been in took care of their clerics and other 
casters that needed gems. The only problems come in pick-up groups 
usually.
