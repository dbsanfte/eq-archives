    If I had to run through I'd be praying for a boatload of caster mobs to
be up. Put on resist gear, punch Resistant, and hope they all pause to cast.
Running through melee mobs that'll pound you again, and again, then stun you
so the rest can catch up, THAT would kill you.

    There is a strong difference. I zone into Sebilis, and barring a moron
train to zone-in I live. I zone into Chardok, I can be jumped ASAP. One of
the biggest changes they could make to Chardok to make it a usable zone
would be to get rid of the one mob that wanders to zone. I've heard they
nuked all the wanderers, so I think we'll see more people heading there in
the near future. And that's a good thing - honestly, it stinks to realize
that if you can't find a group in one of the two places you can go and get a
group that it's time to play the twinks.
