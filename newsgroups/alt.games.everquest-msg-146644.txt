Those Tavern message boards were only in two zones:  South Qeynos and High
Pass Keep.  They weren't world-wide...just for those zones (i.e., a message
you leave in a bar in South Qeynos will show up at the other bars in South
Qeynos, but won't show up on the board in High Keep.  Messages left on the
board in High Keep won't show up in South Qeynos).

It used to be that those boards (especially the one in High Keep) were not
wiped very often.  Lately, they seem to get wiped quite a lot.

If they had been consistently placed in more of the city zones, they might
have been used more often and more intelligently than just to let folk know
that "Gruntzor wuz hear" and "<Mindless Baboons> r0xx0rz!"
