The weapon does still go for around 2k, not sure if I'd pay that for it,
it's only use I could see would be in Duels with it stripping spells (dots,
snares etc) cast on you. If you can't proc it then it makes a good off hand
weapon, assuming you have something better, like Skyfire, in your primary.
If you are under 45 (and will be for sometime) then Skyfire is the better
choice for a primary weapon (it's primary hand only) but this too is
considered a cursed item since the proc is AoE, altho I have seen it used
effectively in a group hunting outside.
