Why *CANT* he get spells?  Im sorry but tell me what is ensuring an absolute
zero chance of getting his 63 spells?

I think you mean, "he cant get them as fast as they drop in HoH by exping
elsewhere" and to that I say tough shit.  Put the work and effort in, sweep
the rewards.

If you wanted your 3 spells so badly you would of a) got your guild+allies
to kill A'D   b) finished a pretty much 1 man quest to gain entry to HoH.

You don't need to be "uber" to get to HoH, you just need to put some effort
in.

So, wheres the problem?
