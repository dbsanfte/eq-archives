Above 200 int level doesn't factor into the equation, it's always 5.8 mana
per int.

Or frozen mantle from snow dervishes, 10 mana, easy to get

Nope, he doesn't give any faction hits, but every other ogre around him
does.  (although given his posts about getting into Charasis, I would go
with the "screw OT faction" path)

Necro's get snare earlier than 29 though, the darkness line of spells has a
snare component, they get their first one at level 4, though they don't get
snare quite as good as the level 1 druid spell or the 29 wizard spell until
the level 29 darkness (in terms of run speed decrease, duration wise
druid/wizard snare is always better for equivalent levels of
druid/wizard/necro)

An effective wizard/necro strategy post 29 is to have the wizard quad kite
(can do earlier but aoe snare is very useful), and the necro continuously
lich n' twitch, with lifetap or leach (or the higher level upgrades, duh)
tossed at a single survivor in the quad that resisted a bit more than the
rest to keep the necro alive and finish off the pack without an extra wizard
aoe.  Although I would imagine that the necro in this pair would get a
little bored.
