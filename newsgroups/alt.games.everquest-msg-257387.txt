1. You earn points for camp A by doing dungeons in camp A
2. As camp A points increase (we'll call this the high watermark for camp
A), the items SHOWN to you by the vendor increase in line.
3. The vendor teases you with some stuff which costs more than the high
water mark for the camp in question.
4. Points in camp A in no way affect the high water mark for camp B.
5. Spending points in camp A subtracts them from your total points earned,
but does NOT reduce the high watermark.  i.e. you will still be shown the
expensive items.
6. You can never spend more points in a camp than the value of the high
watermark in that camp, regardless of points earned in total.

So, if you earn 150 MM points, the vendor in BB shows you items priced from
0-150+a bit points.  The vendor in Everfrost shows you the same old 6 point
stuff.  You now earn 300 points in EF.  The EF vendor shows you 300+a bit
point items.  You have 450 points in total.  You spent 200 points in EF on
some aug.  You have 250 points left.  High watermark in both camps is still
150 and 300 respectively.  You can still only spend 150 points in MM.  You
can spend up to 250 points in EF.  But the vendors will still show you all
the stuff you could see before, you just can't buy it.
