Would you give my damn word back ! liberal means free or at least used to !
Use leftist or socialist please ,since thats what they are . I most
certainly am not anti personal freedom, one of the most basic freedoms is
enjoying the fruits of your own labor which is what the socialists and
leftists in this country are determined I can not do.

Hate to tell you but I am somewhat anti religious as well. If I have to
tolerate gays or evangelists I go with the gays :p

Oh and yes leftists are far more likely to be bigoted and prejudicial .
