You are aware that monks are a decent DPS class?  You know, kill mobs 
fast, get to next mob soon?

How very true.

Clerics are not a must.  Nice to have, sure, but certainly not required.

Shaman is a must have for any group I'm in.

Necros are great.  They can mez, they can charm undead, they can feed 
mana, they can steal mana and give it to the group, they can feed their 
own mana to the group, they can steal hp and give it to the group, they 
can fd, they can rez, they can snare.  Necros rock, I love having one 
with me.
