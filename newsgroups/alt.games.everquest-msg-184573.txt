I think your best class in a duo situation would be a wizard. I don't
see much point in an enchanter duoing with a melee, because you can't
heal the melee player. Likewise, there's not much point in duoing with
a healer, because if the enchanter or chanter pet are tanking, then
you are losing anyway, and no amount of healing will help. With a
wizard, you get the best nuking class, that can also snare the stuff
you fight, and of course provide ports and evacs. The main downside of
the wizard is slow mana regen, and the enchanter has buffs to speed
that up. This combo will excel in outdoor zones where you can snare
the target, and agro-kite it back and forth between the nuking
casters. Also, since both characters can root, they can cover each
other on crowd control. This is also the nucleus of a good AE group,
which can be some of the best exp in the game.
