We all know the trick, however the times i have ported people who want to go
to Qeynos always say... "geee... i wish you where a druid..."

Port to NK, run to SK, lesser evac, run into Qeynos Hills lesser evac and
run into Qeynos City does suck some mana....and time!
Compared to:
Port to Qeynos Hills, run into Qeynos Hills.

The game wasnt born with the Druid Surefall Glade port, it was implemented
not long ago, however no wizard port was made to that area of Norrath,
whilst i and many others think it should of been. Druids can also port to NK
and Succor to Qeynos, but they ALSO get a port directly to a druid friendly
city just outside Qeynos. Wizard ports seem to be more complex and difficult
to use.
