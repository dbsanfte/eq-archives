Actually, while far from ideal, Orlun did a fair amount of xp grinding
doing aggro kiting with my wizard. As long as I could keep nuking,
backing up and sitting, rinse/repeat, I could hold aggro and he could
follow along behind happily backstabbing. Of course, when I'd lose aggro
or die, it was rather rough on the rogue. ;-)

As I said, though, far from ideal.
