I'm not trying to leave one of those annoying "Works on my machine"
messages, but just to add some additional data to the mix, I alt-tab all the
time on my 2nd machine and it never crashes. The machine usually runs my
trader account, but I use him to surf the web and do research, etc. when my
main has a question, so I'm constantly going in and out of EQ and
Allakhazam, etc. The machine is running a P4 and nVidia fx 5950 with most
recent drivers. There's obviously something causing this problem on many
machines, but I haven't seen it in this configuration.
