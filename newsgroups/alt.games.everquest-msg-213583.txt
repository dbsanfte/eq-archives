My first week away from EQ is almost complete.  I deleted all of my toons
and canceled my two accounts.  I contemplated trying to sell my two main
Toons on playerauctions.  I also considered unloading all of their dropable
gear in the bazaar and sell the PP to IGE.  But my patience was totally gone
with SOE so I opted for the nukage approach.  Took the EQ manuals and cds
and trashed them last friday in the Garbage.  For all you that still pay SOE
your fees every month realize that Evolutions is selling cheaper than the
POP expansion sold for just two months ago.  Not to mention the LOY
expansion that only went live back in March.  For their longtime account
holders they should have given us something.

I must say that it has been a real enjoyment to see the amount of free time
I now have.  Also, I have rediscovered several other games that I shelved a
while back.  Currently I am going through Dungeon Seige and have found it
very refreshing.  I also have a copy of Morrowind that I got about 8 months
ago when I considered quiting EQ.  Morrowind looks dam good.  Before I
trashed my two accounts last week I bought SWG to try it out.  I will not be
playing that game past the 30-day trial period.  SWG is like the
illegitemate child of EQ/UltimateOnline/Sim City wrapped in a Star Wars
cover with a intro that has absolutely NOTHING to do with the game.

When gaming turns into a strictly business operation, not run by gamers that
have gamers in mind, then it loses it flavor.  A friend of mine when to
GENCON and saw the new MMORPG based on the Lord Of the Rings.  He said it
looked better than the demo that SOE had at GENCON for EQ2.

After hours of playing just to get that new AA point it is a welcomed releif
to frag bots endlessly in UnrealTournament2003.
