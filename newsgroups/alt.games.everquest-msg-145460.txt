Romantic lines, and what women think when you say them.

M: I'd go to the ends of the earth for you.
W: Yes, but would you stay there?

M: Drink to me only with thine eyes.
W: Yeah, it's cheaper that way.

M: A loaf of bread, a jug of wine, and thou.
W: I'd prefer reservations at a restaurant, thank you.

M: My mother is going to love you.
W: Is she looking for a maid or something?

M: I'd give you the moon and stars if I could.
W: You only say that because you can't. Cheap bastard.

M: Take this single red rose as a symbol of our love's unity.
W: Couldn't get a whole bouquet, eh?
W: (alt) Ooo, you killed a plant for me!

M: I lay my heart at your feet.
W: Yuck! Put it back! Put it back!
