Well - I 2 box, and several of my guildmates do.

Problems I've seen:  People who 2 box on the same machine have to
leave one char completely alone to control the other.  People, like
me, who 2 box with the 2 machines shared by a KVM can be nearly as
bad.  I have programmable keypads set up so I can control either
machine, regardless of which one I'm looking at.  There are things
I simply won't try while boxing:  I won't charm in BoT if I'm running
my kitty, for example.  I've seen people 2 box on 2 seperate machines
and keyboards and do amazing work.  It's all a matter of good setup
and practice.  The only time I have problems is when it drops in the
pot:  I usually have to make a choice to stick with one char and let
the other die.

All that said, a few basic things can be done to make it easier:
1.  Always have the bot and main in the same group.
2.  Run the bot on AF on the main (especially with 2 casters -
my buddy is leveling his wizard up because being a raid leader,
cleric and a ranger who pulls (in our smaller raids) is a LOT of
work.)
3.  Hotkeys are your friends - when I bot my mage I use a hotkey
bank that includes:
/pause 2, /assist Bosra
/pet attack

/pause 2, /assist Bosra
/cast 5  (malosinia)

/pause 2, /assist Bosra
/cast 7  (rod)

etc.  It also has /pet hold where I can reach it quick.

Now, if they demonstrably can't run 2 characters without a huge loss
in their ability to run them, they need to not run them.  We had a couple
of prospects who 2 boxed, and it was a matter of discussion in the thread
for voting them in.  Also, it was very clear they 2 boxed on the same
machine.

Finally, sometimes you wouldn't even know - we had a mini raid where 9 out
of 18 people were run by 4 people (one person had brought in a 65 'chanter
as a 3rd box just to buff us).  One of the people who was new to our
romps was pretty startled to find out who was boxed.  

When I'm grouping for XP I think the thing that is a dead giveaway is that
my 2 pets engage at the exact same time and my mage malo's and my BL
slows at the exact same time.
