With three level 60s, especially including the main tank, Faydedar is pretty
easy.

The first 3 or 4 times I've done Fay our highest warrior was level 57
max...it's a bit tougher with a 57 opposed to a 60 with epic, and I'm
thinking that most people (and uberguilds aren't even close to a majority of
players) don't usually have an epic 60 with a couple of level 60 helpers
handy to make that long and boring run just to help a class that many
uberguilds consider useless except when they need a taxi.

Throughout my responses I've continued assuming that we're still talking
about the original post...the one that I thought sounded like they didn't
have uber firepower at their immediate disposal.  If y'all have changed the
subject, lemme know. :)
