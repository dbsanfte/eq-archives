Shadeweaver's thicket.  Follow the main road out of shar vahl until you come to
the intersection with the guard.  There's a hill to your left where you can see
anything coming at you, pull to there.  You can run to the guard if you get in
trouble.  
FWIW, high quality hopper hides go for 20 plat in the bazaar.  Medium and low
quality hopper hides go for 3 to 5.  Swirling shadows (or mists, I can't
recall) sell for 35 plat each.  Don't sell them to the vendors.
