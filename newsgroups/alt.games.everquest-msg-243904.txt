Again with the annoyance conspiracy. I never intended to annoy anyone. 
That was not the spirit in which I was participating at all.

Again, not defending, merely offering up different scenarios for 
discussion. Changing the premises is only a problem if you're trying to 
win a debate. I'm not. Please tell me how many times I need to say that 
for it to sink in. I'm not trying to offend anyone. I'm not trying to 
defend anything. I was merely offering different scenarios that I thought 
might spur some discussion. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that it will 
be fruitful. That's ok. I can accept that.

He was only provoked in his own mind, rest assured. OJ defense team? 
That's almost funny. I do see what you're saying, but you couldn't be 
more wrong about my intentions. /shrug
