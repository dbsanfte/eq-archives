It's not random, I've been screwed many more times than it's been even or
favored me.

But I do agree that I like Mythic's IDEA...it's a shame they haven't gotten

works, and hell, I wouldn't want them to put in degrading crap, and there's
no way in hell I'd want them to remove no-drop items altogether.
