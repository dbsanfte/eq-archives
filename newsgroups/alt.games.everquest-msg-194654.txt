The first ever magic weapon i looted (Gladius) dropped in Unrest from a
"Lesser Blade Fiend". The MOB is a rare spawn, and i've only personally seen
it once. I can't remember though i think you actually need a magic weapon to
hit him... so if you don't have that.... well i never did figure out Verants
loot/MOB policy at lower levels. Unrest is quite easy to get to from GFay. I
estimate i was around level 20 when i got this weapon for my SK. I mean, you
need a magical weapon to hit alot of mobs in Unrest, now if you are
untwinked and newbie you wont be able to hunt successfully here at all. Now
before RoK came out, how could you hunt here at all as a melee, at the right
approiate level just boggles me. What where VI thinking? People were running
around with bronze weapons and minotaur battle axe's... lol!
