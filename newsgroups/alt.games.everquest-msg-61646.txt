I missed the original post, so don't know what the question was.  If you 
aren't talking about laptops or servers, the only time Gateway has ( to my 
knowledge ) used proprietary RAM was back in the P-133 / early ATX era ( 
I'm excluding pre-386 Gateways).  For a short time they shipped 
motherboards with 2 DIMM slots that required either 2-clock or 4-clock 
memory ( whichever cost twice as much at the time, can't remember ).  This 
caused problems if you just bought your memory from a random dealer that 
doesn't know about specific machines.  If you used the wrong clock memory, 
it would crap out a LOT.  Before then, and ever since, I have not seen a 
Gateway that takes proprietary memory, and I've seen several thousands of 
them.

This was incredibly true in the old days.  I'm on an IBM here at work and 
it doesn't require any proprietary memory.  I also have an older P-300 IBM 
that work was throwing away and it doesn't require any special memory 
sticks.

I had someone swear up and down that Win98 doesn't "use" more than 64 meg 
of memory.  Back when I was running it ( Win2K now ), I pared my machine 
down to 80 meg and cranked up Unreal Tournament.  I loaded a map and it 
took almost 2 minutes.  I then put more in the machine to get it to 192 meg 
and that same map loaded in under 5 seconds.  Sure looked like it used more 
than 64 meg to me.  I started playing UT again 2 nights ago with 544meg of 
RAM in Win2k and it loads nice and fast =)

I don't know what you have now, Jazz ( missed the original post ), but 
until recently I have been running an ATI Rage Fury ( original, not pro ).  
Ran just fine except when I was in the middle of a Rain spell or zoning to 
FV from LOIO ( and WW was Hell ).  I upgraded my father's machine to a 
Geforce3, and I got his Elsa Erazor Geforce2 x2 DDR card.  I don't notice 
any differences in the game except that I don't get any slowdown now in FV 
near the zoneline.  I haven't been to WW, nor have I been where a Rain 
spell was cast.  My guess would be that a Geforce2 would be the low-end of 
what it is going to require to get a decent framerate in with the new 
Luclin content.  I'm upgrading when Neverwinter Nights comes out, so this 
Geforce2 will have to hold me over.  I won't be buying Luclin for a while, 
because I have only seen about half of the zones that exist as of now.

If your video is integrated on your motherboard, pray that it lets you 
disable this in the BIOS or that it will automatically override it if you 
install another card.  I -hate- integrated peripherals.  With a passion.  
Nothing worse than a non-technical person thinking they are getting a 
'great' deal from a computer company and ending up with a machine that has 
a proprietary case with a daughterboard and all integrated peripherals.  
Makes me want to torch some factories.  At least the big companies ( 
Gateway, Dell, etc ) now -tell- you if the periphs are integrated.

Kingston is pretty good at getting you a good match.  On all the PCs I put 
together from ( quality ) parts, I use Multiwave ( http://www.mwave.com ) 
to get my parts, including memory.  I can always find someplace that is a 
few price points cheaper, but I like dealing with them, and they carry a 
wide variety of parts, and their prices are at the low end across the 
board, not just on 1 or 2 items.  Their sales people are pretty 
knowledgable, and if they don't know the answer, they don't hesitate to get 
someone from the tech department on the line to help you, even pre-sale.  
They -want- you to be satisfied, and that's important when I spend 
thousands of dollars a year somewhere.  I'll bet you anything that I can 
save 3-5 dollars on 128meg of ram somwhere else, but that's not as 
important as quality and customer service to me.

I just found your original post with Google.
"Checking http://www.crucial.com/ I find them selling a 128 MB SDRAM, PC 
133, CL=2, Non-parity stick for 19.99 US$."

The CL is the "CAS Level" and 2 is what you would want if you are buying PC 
133 memory.  You can get 3 a little cheaper, but only a dollar or two I 
would think.

This is what bothers me:

"...and they want a fucking outrageous 209 bucks each (sold in pairs only) 
for their 256 MB, 800 MHz, ECC, 16D, RDRAM, RIMM. (The phrase RAMBUS was 
thrown in there somewhere, whatever that means.)"

RIMMS have been out for a while now, and were "slated to die out" when DDR 
hit the scene, or so some people thought.  They didn't die out, but the 
prices did drop to a level where you can actually -afford- it.  If your 
machine takes RIMMs ( Rambus memory ), then you can't use PC-133 memory in 
the machine*** ( the stuff you were pricing from Crucial and the other 
places ).  You will need to price RIMMs, and I believe that they are 
required to be installed in pairs.  Use Pricewatch like you did, but look 
under "800mhz memory" or "RDRAM" or "RIMMs" ( not sure what they list it 
under ).  My favorite place as listed above ( http://www.mwave.com ) sells 
them at a good price, I believe.  

Good Luck.

*** unless there are converters like they had for the DIMM slots taking 
SIMMs.
