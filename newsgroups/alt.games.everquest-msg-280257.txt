LMAO Would you rely on sony to ever do an ethical moral thing, when they 
legally can get away with not doing it? Of course not, that's why 
they're billing us in the first place. Morally and ethically they should 
have just corrected the 'error' going forward, said whoops my bad you 
all get a couple extra months at the old rate, gratz! But there was 
nothing illegal about -trying- to collect... so here we are...

So why are you extending them a courtesy they would never ever extend 
you. They aren't even human, have no feelings or emotions. They've been 
described as psychotic and sociopathic when profiled by psychologists. 
Hardly worthy of being treated as a human being, and being given ethical 
and moral consideration.

They exist in a world of pure legalalities and economics, only a fool 
would try to deal with them on a level of morality and ethics.
