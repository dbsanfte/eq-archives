So is blood type, and we don't discriminate according to it.

I know. Sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs, partial malaria immunity, lactose 
intolerance, and others. Those evolutionary developments are so (
relatively) recent that they don't warrant dividing people in groups. 
And besides, they are not distinctive... Not all Asians are lactose 
intolerant, and not all Africans are prone to sickle cell anemia, so 
those aren't grounds for differentiation.

Of course. But "race" is not what makes us different.
