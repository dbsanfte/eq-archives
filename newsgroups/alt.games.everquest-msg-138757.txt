Well, I've been camping Tenebrous Mountain for the Twilight armor and I just
heard that one of the mobs that I've been waiting for doesn't spawn there
(although allakhazam said it did I've never seen it nor has anyone else.)

So I thought I'd ask about the other one:

Where does a coterie fighter spawn?
