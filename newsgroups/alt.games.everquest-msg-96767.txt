That's bad got another for you that's kinda embarrassing now, shows
how a normally reasonable person (me) can become very petty in the
presence of an idiot. Warning long boring post to anyone not there
lol. Just need to publish this to get it off my chest.

Im solo camping the Hall Ice Giant in EF, now this is a very civilized
camp normally as compared to say Rath, and I like it for that reason.
3 camps well separated not many problem except for an occasional
naughty pet. Nice place until....
My giant pops...Im still a few ticks from fm so I wait a minute then
stand to snare and pull when... the giant just takes off snared. My
jaw drops I look down the hall and see a druid facing the giant
casting. Now understand I have NEVER experienced this before at the
camp in over 300 kills there. I pop and start nuking like crazy she
still gets the xp as I learn later she has 2 computers and a Chanter
in her pocket so to speak. Now again If she had asked to share the
camp I woulda...np I know the rules, don't always follow them in the
heat of the moment but I know them. 
Now it gets better, I was fixing to camp when this happened and my
wife had logged on to get some gems from me, she showed up at this
point without the knowledge of this other druid. Some hot words are
exchanged between myself and the newcomer so she decides to sit right
in the spawn point to get first agro, now she is on thin ice even by
the rules. SO I tell my wife to stay back and nuke when I yell, giant
pops hits me cause Im in the right spot (remember 300 kills I can do
this in my sleep) I snare and yell nuke. Now chanter or no chanter no
way can she ks this and yes she tried. Now she's screaming GM and I
just sit back down. Still she doesn't know there's 2 of us, one taking
screen shots of all this. The guys out front are now getting involved
as we generally have a lot of respect for each other, these are
serious solo mobs and are not to be taken lightly, no HG these they
can take a caster down quick and have seen lvl 50+ go down when things
go wrong.
Now she comes and says " Do I wish to share the camp" I say "you know
the rules as do I and know my response the next pop is yours". She
then says she was doing this for the petitioned GMs benefit, ooo I be
scared now. Cool, she then tries making nice I ignore, way too late
for that hun sorry. Anyway she takes next pop I remain seated
waiting...Well mine pops I stand and snare, THEN SHE GETS UP AND
FOLLOWS ME! Dances around the giant SO I nuke heavily and debuff to
hold agro so she cant get its attention. Now the two guys up front are
saying to me "WTF IS THIS?" I just kill the IG go sit down.  Now one
guy up front says come take his camp he's bored, I thank and do so.
SHe follows me!! Well THen the guy that gave me the camp is pissed too
so he goes and sits in the hall just as it pops and pulls the giant.
SHe is off in a flash, nukes the giant, breaks root, but guess what?
IT WASNT SNARED!!! BANG BOOM POW GOLLY GEE BATMAN THEY HIT HARD..she
died along with her chanter shadow. Hats off to ya man I owe ye
....there is justice. When I finally left the camp after maxing out
wieght she was still yelling for a rez on both chars, someone
apparently made sure every nearby cleric knew why she wanted a rez,
trust me I didnt do it. The fact no one came to rez her has raised my
view of clerics ten fold.
Anyway the thing is Im the bigger idiot for letting ego get away from
me, but no way was this person gonna run me off.  Ok end of long
boring story...
