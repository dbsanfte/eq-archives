Keep Snare / Root always memed, at all times, you never know when you will
need these in an emergency, for example:

Was fighting in a group  in Plane of Disease, (lightcrawlers), I was feared
into a few mobs, I actually had aggro from 4 (3 biles 1 rat), some people
would of trained them to group, some would of just run away getting more
adds on the way and probably dying.  My option was to snare all 4 mobs, back
off, invis, then run to zone.  Kiting adds is also another good use of
snare, when there is no mezzer, or the mobs are unmezzable.


You can solo from 22 - 60ish effieciently.

Soloing for the amount of time will have certain bad effects though.

1. You will only know one way of fighting, and the style doesnt change from
22 - 55, you will be doing the same thing.

2. Your defense will be very low, you can only raise defense by being hit,
usually repeatedly, you do not (or should not if you do it right), get hit
while you are fear kiting, so you defense will not raise.

How to solo?

You first get panic animal at level 22, which is an 18 seconds animal only
fear spell.

Track animal, hunt animal, snare animal, panic animal, recast panic on
around 12 seconds to ensure you do not get hit.

After a while you will be able to do this with nothing but +atk buffs, but
when you begin, use your HP and AC (agility) buffs.

Where to solo?

Good places to solo animals.

Everfrost peaks - Mammoths to 30ish (large wooly spiders are the
placeholders, so kill those too and sell the silk).
Dawnshroud peaks - Small, Medium and Large Zelniaks will take you to 44ish
(no loot here)
Dawnshroud peaks - Rockhoppers (if they are up, ok loot from the hides) to
around 50ish
Jaggepineforest - Griffawns, Griffons and Giant Anacondas, use wolf form
here to prevent adds (ok loot here, plat drops, foraged plant shoots, eye of
the griffon) good to 55ish (ok for AA after this)
Western Wastes - Velium Hounds, haven't fought here much myself, the big
worm things kinda scary, and you need good dragon faction (claws of veeshan)
to not get killed here (have heard can get to 60ish here).

I dont think you should spend your entire time soloing, for the two reasons
stated above, and also, I now detest fear kiting, save it for when you just
cant get a group, as you will tire of it quickly especially if you do it
from 22-60 :)

Another note, forgot about getting a bow with good damage until 51 (at that
level you get double damage on all non rooted, non moving mobs, your melee
damage will still be far higher though).  Get a bow with a good range, and
low delay, dont worry so much about damage until later.  Even at 57 I can
only outdamage my melee with bow is I /disc, and even then, it is not always
by a huge amount (depending on haste).
