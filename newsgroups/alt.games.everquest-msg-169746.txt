You are quite mistaken there.  The pawns and many of the centurions are
green at 14, below is a list of mobs that you could still get xp from 14+.
When do mobs green out at those levels?  5 levels below?  8?  Even if 5
levels, there are a number that would give xp up to and beyond 20.

 Ambassador Dvinn  19 - 22  Monster
 Emperor Crush  18 - 18  Monster
 Kelynn  9 - 9  Quest NPC
 Lord Darish  14 - 16  Monster
 Orc Centurion (Faydwer)  4 - 11  Monster
 Orc Emissary  9 - 14  Monster
 Orc Legionnaire  11 - 22  Monster
 Orc Oracle  8 - 15  Monster
 Orc Scoutmaster  12 - 16  Monster
 Orc Slaver  8 - 12  Monster
 Orc Taskmaster  14 - 16  Monster
 Orc Thaumaturgist  13 - 13  Monster
 Orc Trainer  10 - 12  Monster
 Orc Warden  15 - 15  Monster
 Orc Warlord  13 - 15  Monster
 Retlon Brenclog  15 - 19  NPC, non-quest
 Retlon Brenclog Pet  12 - 12  Summoned
 Rondo Dunfire  6 - 10  Quest NPC
 Royal Guard  15 - 18  Monster
