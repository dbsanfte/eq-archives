  And how do you know they're NOT playing around on their own time?  Just
because they're utilizing their GM privileges doesn't necessarily mean
they're doing it on company time (though maybe it does, I don't know the
specifics of how Verant clocks and pays its employees).

  Also, if EQ is anything like the other online games I've played, the
amount of money most of their GMs are getting paid is laughable and GMing
isn't your atypical customer service type of job to begin with.  They are
there to serve customers directly by answering petitions and the like,
yes... but they're also there to TRY to create a richer and more unique game
world, like a GM in a traditional tabletop game.  Not all GMs have the skill
or authority to do something major like code a new feature, design a new
dungeon or start a major quest/event, so some of their efforts are naturally
going to be focused on "lesser" events.  "GM at play" events in some cases
can even be thought of as "training" so they are prepared when they might be
called on to fill a role in a more major GM-driven quest.  Being the center
of attention for 30+ player characters (some of whom are probably there just
to be disruptive) and keeping everything under control and moving forward,
while trying to make everybody interested and feeling somewhat involved is a
difficult task and does take a little practice, I'd imagine.

  And as these sorts of events seem relatively rare, I doubt that overall
they eat too much into Verant's resources.
