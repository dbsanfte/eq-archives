If you want amusing, though, try ping ponging via sit aggro.  On snared
mobs, this can be a real hoot, sit and the mob runs right for you, stand up
just before it gets there and watch it run back for your partner who just
sat down... funny funny funny.  Throwing nukes in in tandem to keep
the hate roughly the same on both of you is the key here, or eventually
even when your partner sits the mob decides to keep heading for you.
