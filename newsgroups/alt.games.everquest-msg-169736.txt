Ensnare lasts a lot longer than snare.

If you are in a group, snaring a mob when its near death to prevent
running, Snare is a better choice.  It costs less mana.

If you are killing mobs that are going to die soon anyway, Snare is the
way to go.  Costs less mana.

If you are snaring a mob so you can run away from it (presumably indoors
with your SOW worn off) then Snare is the way to go, casts faster than
Ensnare.

If, on the other hand, you expect a mob to take some time to die, Ensare
is the finest snare in the game.  Its not all that expensive, and lasts
more than 3 times as long as snare.

This means that killing high con mobs, Ensnare may be better.

And more importantly, quadding, which takes some time to get set up (have
to snare 4 mobs, while not letting the first one, two, three kill you) and
then isn't exactly your fastest kill method ( the nukes do less damage per
mob, its only the fact that they do more total damage when you add the 4
mobs together that mkes this cost effective)

In short, neither is better in general, each has its own special charms.

As a cleric, I see this happen to some extent with quite a few of my
spells; while many (like your Skin line) get replaced by higher level
spells, others become a trade off of features, and to this day I still use
Root and Stun (a level 5 and level 1 spell) quite often, despite having
half a dozen other spells in those lines.
