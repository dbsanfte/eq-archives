I spend a few days in the warrens killing kobolds and generally
causing mayhem to get paineel faction, and killed the bat lord about
ten times, and got a hat every single time. I was having to sell the
belt to venders in the end as I'd run out out people to give
them to. Maybe I was just lucky?

...But - I see why people think of the game as "work" if they
start doing what you did.  Yes, you want the hat. But singlemindedly
saying that getting the hat is your next task and you won't do anything
else is a sure way to make the game boring and pointless.

Instead you could have :-

Killed the kobolds for paineel faction if you didn't have it, kiling the bat
lord
whenever he spawns.

Go hunting in stonebrunt, and kill the bat lord whenever you came
back to sell up in paineel.

Kill the mugwump as well and see what it drops.

Go and buy loads of supplies and practise some trade skills,
killing the bat lord whenever you need to go re-stock.

Find a bunch of low levels in the warrens and give them a guided
tour of the warrens showing them what's where. And then
being on call to help them out when they get in trouble.

Go hunting somewhere else and port down using the luclin spires
every few hours to kill the bat lord.

See if anyone else is in the warrens and tell them that if they kill
the bat lord you'll pay them for the belt. Go earn enough money
to pay them doing something you actually enjoy instead.

Do without the belt and go and do something more interesting
instead. Sure, you won't get the belt but you'll have six hours of
fun instead. And maybe get another item that's worthwhile.
