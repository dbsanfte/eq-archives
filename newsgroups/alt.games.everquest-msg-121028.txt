Well, if your a Iksar why don't you just harvest them in the water outside
the bank and under the city.  The Barracuda in there drop anywhere from 1 -
3 a shot sometimes more.  You'll need to do alot of swimming and you'll have
to look for the air pockets under the city while harvesting them, but they
are there to be had and cost you know money at all.
