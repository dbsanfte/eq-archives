Network gaming is always more troublesome than single-player gaming
confined to one PC. NWN, for example, still has, to my knowledge,
trouble picking up some servers to display on the server select screen.
That is the same sort of problem. Connectivity and latency issues affect
all games, not just EQ.

of any issue there, as it looks ok to me.
