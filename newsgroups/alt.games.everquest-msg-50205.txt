Thanks, that's really great advice!  I hadn't thought of it that way.

Currently, my level 14 druid (still at 14 since I've been reluctant
to play on Tallon Zek lately because of the constant, senseless PK'ing)
character has a lot to learn, just having got a load of new spells.
So I think I'll play him for awhile before PL'ing.
