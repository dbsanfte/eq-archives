EQ site says you can still go to zones and have new race/class with
128ram.  You only lose the new acter look.
All that aside I put in a 128K module (I had 256 now 384) in less
than 3 minutes.  Second time in my life I have ever done this and it
has been a bit over a year since the first.  Easy as P-I-E.  I am
concerned that I will have enough in my 500mhz machine to run
smoothly, but it is as much as my board can handle I am told (by
Gateway).  I also put in a new video card to be ready.  If none of
that gives me the performance I want I will build a PC after
Christmas (always wanted to build my own anyway).

Just my .02
