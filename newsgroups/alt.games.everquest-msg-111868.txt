As a healing class, you'll get some groups where you're not really
needed, especially if you have enough melee damage (and adds
are controlled or nonexistent.)   In those groups you provide a
safety net.   So buff, Snare, SoW, DD, DS, whatever else as long as
you *always* keep enough mana for healing.

You're also at a level where equipment can make a *major*
difference.  Another group with other people of the same
level and classes might go nowhere near as well.

With SKs, I'd guess you were fear kiting.  Suggest doing the
snare and fear yourself.  Sure, they can do it, but their mana
can be used elsewhere.  Damage shields won't help much
when fear kiting, but DoTs are a good backup plan, especially
since you can med while they work.

Yeah, pretty much, especially when you consider than wizards
are, in a lot of cases, better porters as well.  Try porting on the
moon, for instance, or to the Planes.

But it's important to realize that a class that's the second-best
at almost everything besides melee damage or pulling is still in
far better shape than a class that's the best at something that
isn't needed.  A cleric, for instance, wouldn't have been as
valuable as you in that group.

The only real problem with druids is finding enough people LFG
who realize that there are times when the "best" class isn't
needed and is actually non-productive.  A shaman/druid pair
is perfectly fine for almost any XP camp in the game and does
far more for the group than they would with a cleric replacing
either class, for instance.

Warriors, for instance, are the tank class of choice.  They're the
absolute best class for absorbing damage.  Are they needed in
a group that's going to be fear-kiting?   (Nope, a monk, rogue, or
another SK would all be better choices, and you can probably
put rangers and bards over them in that situation too.)  But
you'll still see a LOT of groups planning to fear kite add a
warrior.  /shrug
