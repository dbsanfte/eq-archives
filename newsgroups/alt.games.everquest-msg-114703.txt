Last night in Chardok, doing BK/IB...everyone was already LOM when an
Ancient Guardian spawned.  Necro was trying to keep him rooted so I could
tash then slow him (he's level 57 and a bitch, tash is almost required)
without dying.  Got one Slow off...resisted.  Died.  Wizard was able to evac
(to zone out) when monk almost dead and cleric being beat on.

Monk died at zone out due to critters there.

This has nothing to do with anything, I'm just whining. <g>
