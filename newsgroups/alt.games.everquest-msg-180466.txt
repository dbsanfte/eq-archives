Heya... OLD XNews hand here...

XNews does not allow archive searching, which is what you are trying to do. 
No nesws client does- for those needs visit groups.google.com. The Group -> 
Find option searches for a newsgroup by name... So "iksar" won't work, but 
I bet "corvette" will. A better way to do it is to look at the bottom of 
the server screen(with the list of subscribed groups) and click All. This 
will give you a full newsgroup list (should be full, you can download the 
latest list from your news server by using Group -> Get Entire Newsgroup 
List). When you are viewing the list of groups, you can use the filter box 
at the bottom to pare down your findings. Try "corvette" or something like 
that to see it in action.

Incidentally that filter box works the same in an actual newsgroup, where 
it will filter the messages. The X next to the box removes the filter.
