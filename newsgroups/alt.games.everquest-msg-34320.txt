"Everytime"?

You are incorrect. I've related exactly *one* incident here, and the
followup reaction.

I'm not surprised that you're having such difficulty with the concept
of "one" vs "everytime". 

>Does anyone really give a crap that your a whiny snivelling punk?

You seem to care deeply about my activities.

And as for if anyone else was interested, I'd point out that there are
at least 600 messages in reply to that original post. That seems to
indicate fairly strong interest.

>don't waste bandwidth telling us 

Then what would you have to rant about like a moron?
