That's the way with a lot of stuff that's supposedly (usually according to
the alternative medicine crowd) hazardous to your health.  You'd be
surprised how many things everybody eats could give you cancer if you were
to eat it until you couldn't walk ten times a day every day.  But in
reasonable amounts there's no more danger than standing by a lightbulb
(which can in fact give you skin cancer were you to absorb insane amounts of
light from a lightbulb for a long period of time).  If you're going to worry
about the dangers of Nutrasweet, you might as well never go outside for fear
that UV rays would give you skin cancer and shield your house with lead for
fear that the natural radiation that emanates from the earth will give you
brain cancer.  I do agree that the stuff is disgusting, though.
