Well, he is a cleric.  He has a root spell that holds very well, nukes for 
undead, normal DD's, and If I am not mistaken, he also has a 600ish undead 
only DoT available, Ykesha mobs *do* break root easily, so having a lot of 
AC, HP, and some good channeling luck, and you should be just fine :)



Enjoy, excellent cash, excellent pulling areas, and adds ONLY happen when 
not paying attention :)
