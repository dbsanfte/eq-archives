I'll second the suggestion of druid + beastlord.  They are probably the
most complementary pair of classes that each solo well.  My beastlord
main would love to have the reliable snare and even limited pull
control (harmony) of a druid handy.  Clerics are indeed the best
healers, but the other priests do well enough, especially at lower
levels.

Others have already mentioned the other natural pairings:
SK + Shm
Rng + Clr  - to constantly rez the ranger, of course. :P
Pal + Dru/Shm

If the kid goes with a WIS hybrid (Pal/Rng/Bst), he will have at least
rudimentary healing, so you might consider an enchanter or a DPS type
instead.
