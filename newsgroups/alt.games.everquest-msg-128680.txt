    The SEQ user sat in zone while the other two top guilds killed AL/HP,
and noted exactly what they did. A great deal of those fights is
positioning, and how do you react to repops - and you can see all of that
with SEQ. If the person is clever they can even figure out the CH chain
timing from watching the main tank's health, although that is a lot tougher.
People in my guild are frustrated by it - right now we're at the stage of
doing Emperor attempts every other day, refining to the point where we'll
take him down. They don't like the fact that after we've worked hard to
figure out the encounter, Wraith will come along using what we learned and
kill him first attempt.

    Oh, there might be one or two out there. ;-) But we never used it to
figure out strategies, even when we were the little guys. You don't learn
anything by copying someone else, and that's bad long-term.

    Most of our people continue to hang around on the boards and chat after
they E-Bay. They can't bear to rip themselves away from friends so abruptly.
If they value those friendships, they honour them by turning things in or
offer to sell to guild first (the account as a whole, not the individual
items).

    It's a very slow process. Although the current rumour du jour on our
server is that someone that recently transferred back from Stormhammer took
the sceptre from the Emperor in Ssra with him. He was in Township Rebellion,
so it could be true. He also just created a guild, Explicit, dedicated to
being the biggest powergamers possible - and took a fair chunk of people
from our competition for top guild when he did it (he used to belong to them
before going to Legends). Who knows, maybe soon Quellious will have four
Tier Seven guilds! =/

    They move on anyways. They had a big blowout recently between the old
guard and the recruits, the upshot of which is they've stopped going to
NToV. I'm sure that blowout also helped convince some of them to move on to
Explicit. (I love that guildname, BTW. Not because it sounds cool - it's
actually a piece of crap. No, because when I want to see a list of ex-Vis,
/who all ex gets it for me. ;-) )

    No, they have pointsflation. So say Cobalt cost 10, then Velious costs
15, and Ssra 25. Killing Trakanon may have been one point - so killing Aary
would be 1.5 and Cursed 2.5. So you COULD get a Cobalt BP faster than one of
the old-guard did - but you're still in the hole for the same amount that
warrior was when he got his.

> Thats ludicrous... I wonder how much stuff rots

    The monk 2HB off Vulak was their most infamous rot, because none of
their monks present wanted to pay the high points cost for a Vulak loot.
They actually rotted a whole bunch of NToV stuff before it was upgraded -
big "D'OH" moment for them at the time.

    You at least know there should be an extra pair on the server, though.
Between ourselves and the other big guild we can go to a GM and say this:
"Between us, we've gotten 12 pairs of AoW pants. They are on the following
characters: blah. One pair is stolen right now, and we believe X has them.
Can you check to see if any others have come onto the server via Legends,
and if not could you check and see how many pairs are on the server?" It
helps convince the GMs that yes, this is an actual theft or a dupe and not
just baseless suspicion.

    And we've nearly nailed this guy on the gnome mask. GM has determined
that it was our guildmate's mask, which got traded between several
characters. He's going to investigate further to see if anyone should be
suspended/banned, but I doubt we'll get that lucky - not only does this guy
set up "trades" between his various accounts, so he can point fingers at his
own accounts and say "X must be the one that duped me" to confuse the issue,
but he also tries to get innocent third parties to help him transfer items
("Can you help with a transfer, please?") to further cloud things. At this
point we just want the mask back, and it looks like we're getting it back.

    Heh. =D
