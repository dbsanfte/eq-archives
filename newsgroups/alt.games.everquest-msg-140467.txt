Assuming you don't need the advantages of a CRT (esp color quality), then
your assessment is correct.  However, "willing ot spend more for a superior
product" can mean many things.  What type of car do you drive?  Is it the
highest trim level of that model?  Is it the top of the line for its make?
If not, then you really should be spending more for a superior product.  I
know, we're talking about a different order of magnitude in price, but that
only makes buying quality even more essential.
