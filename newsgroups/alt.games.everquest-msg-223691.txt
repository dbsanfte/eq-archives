No no, you miss the point still.  It can take 5 hours to get a group 
together, won't matter for this point.  It takes 10 minutes to leave the 
dungeon, sell loot, split, get new mission, and go back in, assuming 
nobody wants to leave.

If they did want to leave, then why were they in a group that was 
willing to pick collection and deliberately prolong the mission by 
refusing to loot the last item?

Plus you get to refresh outdoor only buffs in that 10 minute interval 
between runs!


I'm not suggesting that you are wrong, mind you, just trying to explain 
the details of the two points of view.
