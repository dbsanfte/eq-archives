Mao liked to fuck 12 year old girls.  We knew about it.  Nixon
found it unacceptable.

Nixon also went to China and said "Hiya" and shook hands.

"Unacceptable" doesn't mean you can't be in the same car with
somebody.  It doesn't mean you get into a violent slap fight
and scream at somebody.  It doesn't mean you can't be civil, or
even friendly.  It just means you find something wrong with
whatever is unacceptable to you, and are at least honest about
it.
