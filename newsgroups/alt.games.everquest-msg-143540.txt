I'm with Kaev on this one.  We cannot see how much money other people are 
carrying.  It's always possible that the 'greedy scumbag', by charging 
50pp more and wating for a buyer who -obviously- can afford it, since they 
didn't shop around, has gone from having 0pp to having nearly a fourth as 
much as the guy he's 'bilked'.

}That's very true, Kaev. And a person who comes and keys your car while
}you're asleep isn't 1/100th the scumbag somebody who burns your house
}down while your sleeping is. Your point? Obviously you don't think that
}the above example makes it "ok" to key cars. Same thing.

Not really.  You're really ragged hard on Mr. Trying to Make an Honest 
Profit, here.  You didn't even check to find out if -he- knew what the 
item was worth, either.  Perhaps he strolled into the bazaar with his 
extra special super duper luckiest find in all of today, and decided to 
sell it so he could get something actually useful, checked the price and 
none showed up, shouted for a price check a couple times, and got no 
response (of course, since al 350 people in the zone are AFK, after 
all...) and took a wild-if-somewhat-optimistic guess at the price, and 
presto!  He found a buyer.  I know it's happened to me.  And I bet if it 
happened to you you'd be crowing about your luck instead of sneakingaround 
like a sneaky shitheel greedy bastard type person.

}> There're <far> worse "evils" in EQ than somebody trying to make a

}The phrase "trying to make a little extra PP in a trade" is yet another
}lovely piece to throw in the arsenal of those trying not to say, "trying
}to rip of newbiew or uninformed players for their own profit". I'll have
}to safe that one for later rants. Thanks! :-)

You'll have to remind me... how is it again that we distinguish the 
uninformed newbiesfrom the well-heeled twinks that haven't geared up yet? 
Didn't they have a special color of tag or something?  Generally, if I'm 
sitting AFK selling something, I don't stop to run a background check on 
any customers that want to purchase something to make sure they aren't 
too new to know whether I picked the right price or not.  I'd have to wake 
up, and I need my beauty sleep.  I guess that makes me an evil rip-off 
artist, eh?
