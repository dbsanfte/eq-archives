I'm glad you are having fun learning what to do! Lich is a great spell line
that I don't get to use every day- I'm hunting crag spiders, and if I am
poisoned, the combination wipes me very quickly. My poison resist is
currently 5 (not a typo)- yeah I know I need slightly better gear in some
slots- so I end up poisoned almost every time. But I remember the first time
Jazz's necro didn't survive a smoke break- yet more proof that smoking
kills. I do use it when grouped, or if a nice druid casts regen on me. If
you are getting along with a druid sharing your camp, ask politely for a
regen- That plus Bond, and you'll have unlimited mana, or close to it.

I feign death while waiting for the NK portal to fire. And I port down
invis- Gather Shadows is the self only invis spell. It's just safer. But I
also have no chance of kicking that guard's butt for a while yet. I can't
imagine walking into a character at 55 and not knowning what faction work
has been done, if any. That's got make you paranoid enough to con
everything. Because I've heard of necros being KOS with every town in
Norrath.
