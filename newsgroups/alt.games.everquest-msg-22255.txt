Pretty good specuation though.

Back in the old days, I saw a wizard get busted for kiting in Mistmoore.
There is a spot near the lake where if you stand on the hill, the mob will run
up the middle of the hill and then turn and bash you.   Two steps to the left,
and the mob pathed all the way down the hill, turned and ran around the tree,
and then ran back up the hill on the other side of the tree.    He would take
two steps one way, nuke, two steps the other way and nuke again.  He was
taking advantage of a pathing bug in order to kill it.  (and making a nusiance
of himself in the process, getting adds and either training one of the groups
or the zone repeatedly, causing several deaths).

This is the same situation.   Poor pathing which is being exploited.

*shrug*  Inconsistancy is damn near a Verant trademark.  By the rules they've
given us, this is cheating.     I'd speculate that they haven't enforced it
because it's a low level area, and thus low priority (as Conquest showed, try
the same thing in Sleepers Tomb and see what it gets you.)  and non
disruptive, unlike the wizard in my above example.   I'd say they have several
more important priorities above someone exploiting a pathing bug to kill level
8 orcs.   Maybe they were too busy enforcing name violations. ; )
