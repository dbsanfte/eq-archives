As a Warrior how can I turn off the Mod Rod spell I can use it and don't
want it. Every time I turn around it seems someone is casting this spell and
I have a new Mod Rod. How can it be turned off if Verant wants to create
this type of crap they should have a way for you to turn it off. But I guess
that would require them to think ahead.
