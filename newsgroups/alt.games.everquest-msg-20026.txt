Not really. It actually IS reasonable, depending on the character. It
makes perfect sense as a "nickname" for some female characters. It's
non-offensive. It's not a "title". It's not a copyrighted name or a
referrence to a RL personality. It's not really a phrase.

It's no worse than "Darkhawke" for a surname.
