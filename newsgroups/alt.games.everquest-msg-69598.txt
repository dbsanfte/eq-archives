It is happening with non-broadband users too now, my personal bet is that
Verant's hardware is not up to the graphics load the new expansion is
putting on it.  It seems fairly obvious at this point that they were not
ready to release SOL but did so in order to capture Christmas sales.  Facts
are they are stall patching DirectX 8.1 which they apparently were not ready
to use, lag and logging times are still terrible although zone times have
improved, and their claims that 512 meg of Ram and a PIII would allow you to
use intell i810 motherboards with their built in sound and video systems was
at best a blatant overstatement built both on a misunderstanding of the i810
board and of W98s limitations upon Ram.  All in all they should have waited
and tested more but then that has been the situation with Verant since the
game started.
