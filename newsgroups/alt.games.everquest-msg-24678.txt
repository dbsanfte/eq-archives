All right...based on what people have said here, what I am able to camp, and
what I've found on allakhazam I have made a list of gear that I can buy. This
is mainly for my convenience (I made the list to print out), but it's a lot
easier posting the list here than rewriting it or whatever. The items I listed
put me at 202-204 int...some people wrote that +mana gear would be more useful
than +int at lower levels, but I felt that I might as well buy +int first
instead of switching out when I get into the 30s. Hopefully the gear will last
me a long time. The list:

--------------------------------------

Slot: Item Name (int) - camp (location/mob)/buy

arm: gatorscale sleeves (4) - camp (upper guk/an ancient croc) or buy
back: kunzar cloak (2) - buy
chest: crystalline robe (6) - camp (crystal caverns/queen dracnia) or buy
ears: batskull x2 (10) - camp (timorous deep/the great oowomp)
face: sheer bone mask (3) - camp (timorous deep/the great oowomp)
feet: polished stone anklet (2) - camp (field of bone/burynai cutter)
fingers: velium fire wedding rings x2 (0) - buy
hands: impskin gloves (5) - buy or camp (sol a/kindle)
head: runed circlet (4) - buy, or nightshade wreath (5) - camp (mistmoore/maid
issis) or buy
legs: drake hide legs - buy
neck: sapphire platinum (7) or velium (8) necklace - buy
shoulder: embroidered black cape (0) - buy
waist: braided cinch cord (4) - buy
wrists: golden cat eye bracelet x2 (0)
primary: stein of moggok (10) - buy
secondary: crude stein (0) - buy
range: student's homework (3) - camp (tower of frozen shadow/angry librarian
[second floor])

total int bonus +60 - +62

--------------------------------------

Thanks for all the helpful posts and advice. It was all highly appreciated, and
I found it all to be really useful. By the way, I'm camping the gear with a 40
monk, either grouped with guildies  or solo. Tell me what you think about my
choice of gear.
