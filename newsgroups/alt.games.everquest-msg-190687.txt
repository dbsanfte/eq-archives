I two-box most of the time when I solo (duo). Find a combo that works well
together where one does most of the finger work, and the other can be done
with just a few hot-keys. Example: Warrior-type/healer-type  Play
warrior-type during battle, hit heal hot-key when needed on the second
machine.

The real key to two-boxing is seting up your hot-keys, so you are not
fumbling for the mouse, or trying to type command line stuff going between
machines. I like to change the viewpoint (F9) on one machine to see the
scene from farther back. It helps spot adds, and potential trouble, and it's
fun to watch the battle from 2 different perspectives. I also almost always
have my secondary character in \follow mode in case I have to run for it.

If you get really good at it, you can try it in groups, but make sure you
tell the rest of the group you are 2-boxing. I do know a guy who plays a
Shaman/Monk duo 2-box. He role-plays them both completely different, and you
would never guess they were both played by the same person, at the same
time. That's the exception though, and you can usually tell when 2
characters in the group are being played by the same person. If I'm
grouping, I usually only play one character, and use the other box to put up
my trader in the bazaar.

Good luck
