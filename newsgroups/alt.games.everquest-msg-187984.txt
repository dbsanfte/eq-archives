Hmm, it becomes apparent that the difference lies in our usual groups.
When the 3 of us were joined by a husband/wife team of Wiz/Ranger,
you can see why we were more intent on mitigating damage (slows) and
someone who could self regen (canni) as we had nobody to slow or
cast mana regen otherwise.  OTOH - DPS was VERY good :)

Of course we won't even talk about the times I've been in groups
where a mage is primary healer :)  Was in a group in FG once with
an Epic pet tanking, 2 other GV mage pets and a necro pet as the
primary damage output.  The epic mage used her mana to heal the
pet the rest of us might drop a nuke here or there, and the necro
feign pulled the mutant dregs :)  To say they dropped fast is a
vast understatement :)  I saw a group operating in PoN once that
was Epic mage - Epic pet tanking, BL slowing, and 4 other mages
with either GV water or 61 air/ 62 water (it's hard to tell at range,
but a couple of them were definitely manuevering for the BS).
With the way an epic grabs aggro, the BL was slowing on incoming,
the mob was lasting a *very* brief time.  These all pet groups
are not only fun, but they've blown every traditional group I've
ever been in completely away for kill rate.
