Shadowhaven faction is actually pretty easy, I did it with my shammy.  It is
nothing at all like Cabilis.  How is your faction in Shar Vahl?  I don't
honestly know the best place for you trollish types.  I practiced mine in
Freeport, before my first incident involving Lucan, and subsequent
misunderstandings with the guards near the zones to NFP.  On the bright
side, I don't need to worry about my faction standing with the militia
getting any worse.

Just keep repeating to yourself, "This is so much easier than tailoring",
that might help.
