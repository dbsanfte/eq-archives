Newbie characters won't need that STA since the amount of hps you get
per point of STA is pretty low.

At level 60, an SK gets I think 5.8 hps per point of STA.
I'm pretty sure you're not going to miss too many hps at level 1.  If
you're concerned, toss your twinkie a pair of velium fire opal rings.
The 130hps from those will work much better.

First off, unless there's some stacking that I missed, 120 to 255
would be very difficult.

Second, the amount of mana you would need to burn to get that level of
boost (unless you somehow obtained a primal weapon), is a pretty big
waste.

Third, you pretty much have to get some of that increase in DEX from
items and that usually means you have to swap out some other
potentially meaningful stats for them.  

Generally, worrying about DEX is a bad idea.  Just concentrate on the
critical stats and let the rest fall where it will.

You cover those skills fast regardless.
Try it.

Make a meleer class with low DEX/AGI and make one with high DEX/AGI,
the difference in rate of skill increase is pretty marginal.  You
might lag slightly in the earlier levels, but those levels fly by so
fast and those levels tend to be very forgiving for "lacks" it's not a
major concern.

Check the logs.
I refuse to believe anyone these days when they tell me "hey, I think
I'm proccing more".  I felt the same way when I got primal avatar
tossed on me.  I checked the log, it was a 3% difference with a +100
DEX.  Damn fine use of mana there...

Hell, I had a far bigger increase in overall proc count by just
getting Shissared....but then that should have been obvious.

Yep.
Instead of whiffing and connecting for 10's and 20's, I connect more
often and connect for more damage.  That +100 ATK is like 3 or 4 extra
levels worth of offensive skill increases.  

Although, even with that, I wouldn't bother asking for primal avatar
from my shaman in an exp grind group unless he was sitting on full
mana and didn't have anywhere else to burn it.

It's 100 DEX/AGI/STR and ATK.  I think they could have halved the mana
cost, made it just +100 ATK (and gotten rid of that stupid reagent)
and the spell would have been cast more often.  As it is, the normal
Avatar requires an emerald and has a fairly long hold time and NO
SHAMAN I know casts this ever.  Primal Avatar, the no drop spell that
only drops in Sleeper's Tomb doesn't require the emerald, just a lot
of mana--they might cast this but even that's rare.

>Wouldn't call it idiot meleers. It does have an effect. 

Against VERY specific mobs, yes.
The VAST majority of meleers playing this game will never encounter
these mobs.

In exp grind groups, STR, DEX and AGI buffs are largely meaningless.

>...You'd have to know the
>exact internal game engine works to really answer that. 

Or you can generate a bunch of logs against a bunch of different mob
types and use some common sense.

Against mobs with high AC rating, melee stat buffs do seem to play a
role.  Unfortunately, I can only think of about half a dozen "high" AC
rating mobs and none of these are "exp grind" mobs.

He asked what is better given that they had an SK already available:
A shaman or druid (see the title of the thread)?

The point is that snare (one of the more useful combat time spells) is
already available with the SK so it's lack from the shaman's list of
spells isn't as critical.
