>What guild is this, if I may ask? :)

Midnight Vultures.

A very small family style guild. Most of us play after midnight
eastern time, so that why the guild officers chose that name. Have
about 16 characters and about 13 players right now. The average level
would be about 50 without the alts (some of the officers have very
little play time and are low 40's right now) but the people who are on
the most are level 54 to 59 (With a few over 60, our Blue Elf Chanter
just made 65). Mostly we just help each other camp quest items, and
when we can field a full group (usually on Sundays), we go someplace
like Veksar to pick up equipment upgrades for guildies. Though there
are a few that want to grind exp more than anything else, but they
seem to have tired of trying to hit 65 before the next expansion. =)
We intend to raid occasionally when we have the manpower for it. We
will probably hit some targets in Kunark and Velious first.

About half the guild will role play, if you are role playing, but most
of them don't usually.

There are essentially two entrance requirements. Be level 45 or higher
and know how to play your character. (Though the Level 45 requirement
is waived for people who are nice and who are excellent players.) We
will want to group with you a few times first though. I believe that
nothing can kill a guild faster than inviting Morons and Jerks into
it.

Don't expect much out of this guild, except company and help when you
ask for it. Right now we don't have any "phat lootz". =)

I don't know if you wanted a full run down, but I decided I might as
well. We are always recruiting.
