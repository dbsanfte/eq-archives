This may have something to do with whether or not the person that initially
aggroed them is still alive.  I've seen many mobs that ran by me chasing
someone run back past me after he got away.  On the other hand, I was
standing on a little island in a bay in the Isle of Refuge and someone
pulled a shark and fought it next to me.  He dies, and the shark immediately
attacked me.  It's also possible that this was simply close enough to the
shark's spawn point (or patrol region, perhaps?) that it was considered to
be back as soon as it was done with the other guy.
