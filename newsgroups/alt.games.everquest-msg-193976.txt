Operating question is "do we kill twice as many mobs per hour grouped than I do
solo?"

Same question I ask myself as a bard.

Usually the answer is no.

But then I ask "hmm, how about 'almost twice?"

Because really I can accept a lower exp rate for the company and the fact that
I can do some very different sorts of killing with a partner than I can solo.
If its not abyssimally worse, I'll take a partner or group any day.  After all,
I can always solo.

A necro in hate kite mode or fear kite mode could easily find a partner a very
significant boost in kills per hour per hour, particularly high DPS classes
like rangers and rogues.  Rangers also get some buffs that work well on the
necro and his pet, but short duration enough that you don't just bop down to
the Nexus and buy a set and go off to solo for a few hours.
