 To answer this: yes. A lot of times the first pull will be a named.
This is especially true in VP actually, with the first mob being either
Silverwing or Hoshkar, whichever makes for the better pull at the time.
Most raids, such as ToV, we clear what we have to to get to the named so
you sort of warm-up by default. If we can get our target on the first
pull we will. I don't think we've ever done "warm-up mobs" specifically.

 But yeah, even though Hoshkar is now a joke for us it's still a nervous
moment for me when the INC is called and I see him come around the
corner. And that's what keeps me playing EQ. Once that feeling is gone
so will I.
