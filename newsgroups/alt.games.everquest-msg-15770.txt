No. Verant has stated that half elves have no distinct culture of
their own, and would never be taught the secrets of cultural smithing
because they are not "racially pure." On the upside, they can
wear/use all human, wood elf, dark elf and high elf item.

Freeport. Take a look the Recipes | Smithing section of
