Well, its that time of year for me again, unplug the modem, pack up the 
hardware, and off I go to offline exile.  This time looks to be 6 months 
instead of my normal 3, as I've gotten into a second renaissance 
festival, this one out near Dallas; 3 months in Arizona isn't enough, so 
we're doubling it.

Its vaguely possible that there will be a phone line at the Texas 
location, in which case I'll doubtless be back much sooner... otherwise, 
well I love EQ, but not enough to run it thru a cell phone.

Funny thing is, I've not played in several days, because I've been 
playing Neverwinter Nights while downloading more NWN modules, trying to 
build up a stockpile of stuff to do while I have no modem.   Its a 
decent game, though no EQ, especially not solo; NWN -can- be multiplayer 
rigged apparantly, and thats a nice thought, but when I have a modem, I 
play EQ!

I'll have limited internet access, thru the local library in AZ, so I'll 
probably check in a few times and try to keep up with whats happening in 
EQ land, GOD and all... and spy on the release of EQ2, if it happens to 
come out before June (which I doubt).

Other than that little bit of methadone, though, its cold turkey for the 
next several months.

Oh, and if you want a sword made, too bad, because I'm also not packing 
my forge.  Dunno what I'll miss more, playing EQ or going out to the 
garage and hammering on 2000 degree pieces of steel... ones a lot less 
dangerous, with mere virtual death looming in my face, but then, the 
other is somehow more satisfying and besides, it pays the mortgage.
