You already HAD the newest drivers.  DirectX is a suite of files including
all sorts of drivers that overwrite what you HAD.

Do you HAVE to reinstall the latest drivers (that you downloaded from the
manufacturer's site, I'm sure)?  Probably, but not necessarily.  Can you
start EQ?  Can you get all the way into the game?  Do the graphics and audio
seem ok to you?  Then no, you don't have to update your drivers.

But if you have ANY problems in the game (other than "how do I kill a bat"
type things) don't bother asking here or on EQ's webboard until you've
installed those drivers since that's the first thing we're going to tell you
to do anyway.
