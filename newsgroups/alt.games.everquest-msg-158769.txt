Amen!

I stated some information earlier, that until recently, I have found rather
contradictory.

I use a Lamentation and Centi LS as my 2weps, and have trouble at times
holding aggro.

I switched to a slower, but proc-ing 2HS (Felhammer 36/46 +proc smite) that
almost always gives me aggro! Hit damage + proc pisses those mobs right off!

I now find myself not using my x2 1HS as much, but my 2HS.  I guess a soon
as I get some better 1HS this may change!

Thanks for the information!
