I will research this more, but my assumptions come from two zoologists
that have studied such behiour in big cats.

If a company or government were to publicly conduct such a study there
would be such an outcry about prejudice that it would be shut down.
The retardation was non-intellectual as I stated.  Mental retardation
are not limited to mathematical or spacial abilities, all forms of it
exist.

I never stated them as facts, I just presented them from my view.  You
assumed they were to be facts.  Some are constants, some may not be.
But together they make up my belief.

Masturbation and birth control are religious taboo's, but not
infertility.  None are social or moral taboo's, in fact birth control
is morally correct since not everyone wants to or should procreate.

It is not worthless or offensive to state my beliefs in open forum.  I
am not spewing it but laying it out as logically as I can over this
medium (I am not a typist by trade).  And my logic is thought out and
understood, I do not parrot others.  I also do not just roll over
because people do not agree with me or think me biggoted.  Perhaps I
am, perhaps I'm racist too.  But as I said, a horse is a horse is a
horse....
