The AC in Sro spawned in under 15 minutes, it was KSed, and then the KSer let
me loot it.

I walked into Kurn's Tower to get attacked by the Undead Jester, club in hand,
who had been trained to zone.

I killed Kindle and got some gloves the first try.

(not really a rare spawn) but I found an FBSS on a vendor once.
