If one takes a game ... any game ... so seriously as to derive a significant
chunk of their self esteem from the playing of it, this (IMO) is an
abnormality.

And they have been reimbursed for that time, even if it's nothing more than
room, board, and a stipend.  They've earned a living at it, the same as I
have for doing my job.  And that's what it is for them ... a job.

Back to golf.  If I played golf every day, and that's how I earned a living,
sooner or later golf would become a job.  Moderation keeps it as a game, and
keeps it enjoyable.  For me, at least.  YMMV.

Except in a very few cases, playing EQ is not a job.

> The olympic games...(yes that's right... they are also *games*!)

The olympics haven't been games for some time now.  They're stepping stones
to endorsement deals.

Only when being chased by another person wielding a knife.

Agreed.  Personally, I'm not.  I don't have a character over 62, and none of
them have an epic.  I play a very few hours a week.  Not because I can't,
but because I choose not to.  I choose to have other interests.  In fact, my
wife tells folks that I seem to go out of my way to acquire new hobbies.

Again .. everything in moderation.

True.  I suspect that a fair share of those who drive for olympic gold have
an ulterior motive in mind ... endorsements.

But I freely admit that I'm jaded when it comes to the olympics.

Don't get me wrong here ... I'm not a huge proponent of buying game items,
particularly items that already have the NoDrop flag set.

Plat is another matter ... I really don't have that much of an issue with
plat.  I used to, but not any more.  The in-game economy has cause me to
rethink my stance there.

Mudflation has hit the point that unless I spend the the limited time I
choose to allot to EQ farming IGs or HGs I can't keep enough money on me to
buy the spells my characters need as they advance.  I've stopped my druid at
62 because the defining spell for 63 is Pot9, and there's no way in hell
I'll ever be able to afford it.

So plat ... yeah, I can see that since there's no way they're ever going to
get the mudflation genie back in the bottle.  Items?  Not so much.
