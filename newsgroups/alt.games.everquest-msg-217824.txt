For VT, you need to get a guild, farm bane weapons(can only kill the emporer
with bane weapons) and emp keys(need 4 items and you combine...need this to
access the emp).
Kill the emporer for an item, then farm 10 shards from 10 specific luclin
zones(can farm shards anytime). Combine shards, item from emp, couple other
things and you get a VT key.

For Bot, you either do a quest.. or get to level 62 and you can get it.

HoH has a quest too. One of which, is killing a dragon in PoV. Not sure if
there's a level when you can zone in with no flag though.

check this:

doesn't show the new level requirements though.
