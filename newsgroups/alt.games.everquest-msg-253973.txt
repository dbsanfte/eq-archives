Something weird is going on there,there are conflicting
reports about social aggro,tested it with my 53 Pally and
got the whole room either bats or rats.

Visited zone today with my 33 Cleric ,found mobs
hit frequently in the 60ties and very fast,back to MS. :)
Oh,and the exit phrase "I am ready to leave" didnt work
while I was fighting a rat close to the "Exit-NPC".
Luckily I could channel a gate,what surprised me as 
fast as I was being hit.
