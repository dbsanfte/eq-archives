No race has an advantage in mana regen.

Mana tips for clerics:
- Don't use Symbol on anyone but the tank, and possibly yourself and the
chanter.
- Group with an enchanter and get Clarity.
- Learn to sit down. Your default location is sitting. You stand only to
cast.
  If the group is on the move, sit down if you stop for a moment.
- If you are loaded with cash, get a horse. The cheapest is about 8400 plat.
  A drogmor is better for targetting but costs a bit more than the cheapest
horse.
- Cast your heals for maximum effectiveness. They should always land for
maximum.
  Also, remember heal-over-time spells are usually quite mana efficient.
- Your HP/AC buff (Courage, Valor and so on) are generally more efficient
heals
  than your second-best heal. So you have Sup Heal, *don't* cast GHeal, use
  your HP/AC buff instead.
- Make sure your group is handling aggro well. Basically the only one
getting
  hit should be the tank. If that's not the case, talk to whoever is pulling
  aggro.

The heal/sit cycle can be boring. Well, such is the life of a cleric; you
get
some toys in your 50s and 60s that make it less so, including several self-
buffs with a mana regen component. Blessed Armor of the Risen plus Yaulp 5
isn't as much mana as KEI, but it's not too far off the mark.

Yes, the domain is sad, but effective. :-)
