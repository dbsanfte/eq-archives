No, there were and are lots of places that I could cast a faction buff
to fix KOS, including Kael at this very moment.  I'm slightly KOS to
frost giants, I sing faction song, I'm now dubious and can travel
freely.  I've done the same trick in Grobb, and in certain parts of
Neriak.
I did some more playing around in Velks Lab and what they have done is
set the default faction lower on all mobs in the zone.  Mobs used to
glare at everyone, then switch to dubious with the application of
faction song/spell.  Now they all start of scowling at everyone and
change to glare with faction adjustment.
Why do you call this a bug rather than a nerf?  Was it a bug to have
Kael start off glare to everyone but Rallos Zek worshippers?  Or to
have Thurg start off not KOS to most folks?  There was an un-announced
change to faction in one of the more popular high-level zone, the GM I
spoke to knew nothing about it before I demonstrated it to him.  There
was nothing in the patch message, and I've seen nothing from Verant
indicating it was intended.  So yes, that is damn well a nerf until
Verant says that it was intended.  I bet you thought the bard selos
drum bug was not a nerf either, since no other class could increase
their speed by as large a margin.
