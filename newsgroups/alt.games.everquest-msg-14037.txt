No, they should not have exploited the fucking bug when they KNEW THEY
WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO IT and that doing it anyway was a BANNABLE
OFFENSE.

The fact that an exploit is there isn't justification to IGNORE THE
RULES.

YES, VI should have fixed the bug. But, CQ knew it was a bug, knew
exploiting it was against the rules, and did it anyway because they
thought they were too good for the rules. They deserved to get their
asses banned. And, given tales of CQ's schoolyard bully behavior on
Lanys (Ignoring raid calanders or using them to intentionally clear
the dungeon/plain before the guild on the calander can get to it),
more than a few people are glad they're gone.
