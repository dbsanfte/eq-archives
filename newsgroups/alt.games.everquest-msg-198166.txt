Its fairly simple to modify the player info window if you have any knowledge
of how the XML works. I made a modified player window that shows a % for
health, mana, and stamina, and also added an Exp guage that also tells you
how for into the level you are, so I didnt constantly have to open my
inventory screen to see how much Exp Ive been making  : )

Likewise if the OP really doesnt like the % then its a trivial task to take
out the reference for it in the new XML that came with this patch.
