Without giving away too much?  Come on, man, unless you're a beta tester or
something, what is it that gives you this absolute information that SWG is
going to suck?  I mean, I'd understand you doubting that it will be as good
as SOE says, or guessing that they'll make some (or a lot of) mistakes, but
it seems pretty damn complacent to me for you to sit back with a satisfied
smile and say, "Ah, well, they'll all be back.  SWG is gonna suck and
they'll sure find that out, then they'll come crying back and tell me I was
right!"  Frankly, though EQ is a great game, there are a number of things
about it that suck goat scrotum (pardon my language).  SWG appears to have
addressed every single one of those problems in very ingenious ways, from
what I've been reading on the site.  Now I suppose it's possible that the
developers are just lying and they're not really doing what they say they're
doing, or that their solutions won't work like they think they will, or that
there'll be so many bugs it won't even be worth mucking through them all,
etc., etc., but frankly with the incredibly awesome concepts going into the
game, I'm going to try it, dammit.  Even if it doesn't work I'll still think
they made a damn good try.

Oh, oh, wait.  That's it.  You must be one of those people who think SWG is
going to crash and burn because of SCS.  Never mind, have fun with EQ.
