HAHAHAHAHA...

Ok, maybe against Nagafen.

Not even against Vox (if you're having to Zerg a CHealing mob, it's probably
not
going to work anyways).

I really can't think of how this would work...at all.  All it takes is ONE
cleric
with an epic to do what you're saying...they can rez just as quick as they
can
click and re-click.  Even with the epic rez, 20% health, slowed, weak, and
manaless isn't exactly a good raid force.  Getting a battle rez to zerg
something
that flurries, rampages, enrages, AoE's, says mean things isn't going to
work.

The cleric epic is THE best epic in the game, but not because it would allow
zerging end game mobs.  It allows a decent guild to recover from a wipeout
a lot quicker to try a mob again, or move somewhere else.  I would LOVE
to see some folks battle-rez zerg the AoW...unless you have 30 clerics there
still alive with enough mana to CHeal all of the melees and enough
enchanters
there alive to KEI the nukers/other healers participating in the CHeal
chain,
it's just not going to work.  I know that if my own guildleader insisted
that I take
4 or 5 deaths from the SAME freaking mob on the SAME freaking attempt, I'd
tell him to fuck off (in /tell, of course).  What, I'm not a ranger or
something...
