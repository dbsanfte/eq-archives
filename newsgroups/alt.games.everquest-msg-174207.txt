Taking down the sand giant ring bearing named today, I had the
oddest thing happen.  I hit the MA with a fast  heal which landed
just as he got very low on HP.  He vanished off my targetting,
but the heal landed, popped him up to 40% HP.   When I clicked on
his bar in my group box, I got his corpse on target...he'd died.
But he continued to have 40% HP in my group bar, all thru the
fight and up until I rezed him back into the zone.
