Fish Rolls triv at skill 135 - although there may be slightly cheaper,
easier items to make for skill ups, the fact that bat wings and fresh fish
are so easy to come by, I would highly reccommend just filling up a few
packs of each, and spend an hour or so clicking combine.

You will get a lot of failures to start, but with some half decent int gear,
it shouldnt take too long to get to an acceptable level. My favourite place
for making them would have to be freeport. The casters guild sells unlimited
batwings (first vendor up the stairs if I remember correctly), and just one
zone away in east freeport, the guy at the docks sells unlimited fresh fish.

Just pick up a spit from somewhere, go find a quiet corner out of the way (I
tend to use one of the many empty buildings found in all the major towns),
and bake until your heart is content. And once you have make a few stacks,
you wont have to worry about food for a long while.

Oh, and while your there, make sure to stop by Ping Fizzlecutter, at the
little camp just outside the west gate (I think he only spawns at night
time, but could be wrong). He sells Fizzlecutters Formula 5000, with is also
an enduring drink - a couple of stacks of those will last a very long time
too (I think 1 fish roll, and 1 formula 500 each last approx 2 RL hours)
