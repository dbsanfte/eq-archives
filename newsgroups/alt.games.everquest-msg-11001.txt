That could be possible. Class/Race figures into it...a halfling rogue could
moderately easily, an iksar/troll anything would have a lot more
difficulty.

Mostly it depends on how well you can group (or, if you are a soloing
class, it would depend on your ability to get into a nice camp, like
raptors in timorous, cindrella in feerrott, skyfire, ice giants, whatever).
If you can stay grouped most of the time, then 52-53 over a weekend is
quite doable. It would take the WHOLE weekend however.

54 or 59 would be out of the question however.
