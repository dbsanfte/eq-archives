The one thing that worries me is that I'll spend too much down time in 
groups with "half a group" waiting for the other half to be enticed to 
join, and "leaders" call out in /ooc or whatever "Join me! I have mana 
regen 6! Need  a healer! Please come!" And since we aren't full, the 
leader will insist on sitting on his ass waiting for more. At which 
point, it becomes a revolving group, as folks are enticed into leaving 
one half formed group to join another half formed group, trying to get 
into a group that's actually going to kill soemthing.
