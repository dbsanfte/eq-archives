Yeah, times might be a little off, but that's mostly what happened, 14-18
people were in perma by the time I joined, and I spent about 1-1.5 hours
getting 6 or so people there total.
I was however invited after people were already there, so it wasn't like
there was really a planned time to start, I'd say it took about 4-5 hours
from "Do you have Circle of Summer?" to dropping the last 2 people that I
ported out into EJ.  Total reward for 4-5 hours of work?  Learning why guild
raids are immensely better than pick up raids, screenshots of a dragon
corpse and 5pp off a spider that somebody forgot to loot on the way in.

When we started junk buffing, we were using Circle of Winter (FR buff) as a
junk buff, but when I started casting the raid leader told me "don't do that
yet" along with about 3 other people, until someone else with reading
comprehension pointed out that that wasn't Circle of Summer and he publicly
apologized.

I didn't do quite as much buffing as you suggest though, CoW as junk buff,
Str as a late dispel/not-completely-junk, Pack regen since I had full mana
and CoS so we didn't turn the raid into a zerg bind rush with shit for
resists, and a few single target crap buffs for a couple people in my group
that the crap buffers missed.

Then I blew most of my mana once we were engaged running around in her AoE
spot healing people in my group that dropped below half (including myself at
one point =P), and spot healing the MA when one of the clerics went down.
