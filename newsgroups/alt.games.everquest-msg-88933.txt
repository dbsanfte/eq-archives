My forage skill has gone up alot since i figured out how to assign a
social that performs forage to the "move forward" key.  Now every time
I move forward I attempt to forage.  The other day I added Sneak and a
few other things to that social key, so now I do the following when I
move forward:

/loc
forage
sense heading
sneak
pause a few
sneak (to unsneak in case I actually sneaked.)

Of course, this is only assigned to the hotkey on the hotkey page I
have up when not in combat.
