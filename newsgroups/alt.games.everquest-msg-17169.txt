I was in lower Guk for my wiz rod for the staff of the wheel quest.  Made it
to the hand room which was not camped.  So I dashed in and picked it up
hoping to gate.  Failed to channel 2-3 times and was getting down to a
single bubble so I ran out of the room figuring to die in the hall and come
back to loot the corpse.  When I got to the hall I tried once more to gate
and this time I made it with half a bubble.  Now I was bound in lower Guk at
the zone line.  So before I leave I figured I'd shout a yippee to the zone.
Next thing I know the hand is on me again.  That zoneline is *not* close to
the hand room.  So how did he catch up to me so quick?  I had expected to be
so far away he would just go back to his spawn point.  Is this normal?
