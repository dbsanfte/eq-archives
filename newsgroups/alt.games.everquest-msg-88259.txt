*smacks forehead*

Yeah, and since I've coded countless time/date storage
and conversion routines through the years, and actually
knew that already, my only defense is that it was
5:30 in the morning, after a 17-hour session of heavy
coding had already fried my brain.

Doh!

But you have to admit that the "123456 hex" is an
amazing coincidence.  :-)
