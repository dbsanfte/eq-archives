In all honesty I just didn't want everyone to think I was like some others
who would just say "gay pride" in the derogatory sense. And some people
jumped to conclusions anyway and presumed I was. While I am not gay I don't
begrude or belittle those who do. I'm more of the live and let live type.
I'll hate you for being you - not for what some elements of society say I
should.
