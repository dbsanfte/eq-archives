In one particular message he ended with "Regards, Eduin"

This links him to Tarew Marr, where he 3-boxes a monk, shaman, and wizard
(Eduin, Edashi, Edshard).  He also ends most messages on the TM server board
with "Regards, Eduin".

He's in a mostly european guild (Britannic Lore), who are about average in
achievement (HoT, WToV named capable last I checked, but not Aaryonar),
mostly decent people (except Eduin)

On the Tarew Marr server board (www.realpoor.com), he's been commonly known
to be a bigoted idiot quite often.

One of his favorite pastimes includes farming Phinigel Autropos.

As a matter of fact, one of my RL friends made a little picture about Eduin,
which has since been adapted as one of Britannic Lore's member's sig on
Realpoor. (http://mail.britlore.co.uk/~Zwad/Eduin.jpg)

So, nice slip Ed, and btw, good luck selling your boots of flowing slime for
100k. Ever.
