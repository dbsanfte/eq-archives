I don't see how a necro can say this, or else you're no where near 60... as
a shadowknight, I get maybe the earlier half of necro spells (and much later
in my career) and I still see how useful they are.  For example, Heart
Flutter, which I'm sure you have much higher upgrades to even if you were my
level (45): disease based DoT, lowers 3 or 4 of the critter's stats, and
although I could be mistaken, I swear it slows them ever so slightly
(perhaps due to the stat reduction?).  Anytime I'm fighting any critter of
any importance, this spell goes on them.  Yes, I'm a melee class, but your
skelly pet will appreciate it just as much- DEBUFFS GOOD!  Even if you fear
kite (I certainly do) the lower ac and stats still make the fight quicker.
And as said before, disease spells aren't always resisted by some things
that resist everything else...
And as said before, it stops/slows critter regeneration...
And as a melee type- it makes a good taunt!

Useless line of spells?  Far from it ;)
