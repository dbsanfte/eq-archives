The problem here is that we have been seriously spoiled by the ZEM in the 
four PoP planes available to everyone.  At level 61, there are still a 
number of zones I can go to to XP on dark blue mobs, they just suck when 
compared to PoP zones as things stand now.

Old Sebilis (solo or grouped)
Chardok (solo or grouped)
Fungus Grove (solo or grouped)
The Grey (solo)
Cazic Thule (solo or grouped)
Western Wastes (solo or grouped)
Dragon Necropolis (solo or grouped)
Plane of Growth (tougher to solo there now, but xp grouping still works)
Crypt of Nadox (solo or grouped)
Torgiran's Mines (solo or grouped)
Hate's Fury (Have not played there much, solo looks iffy at entrance)
Temple of Sszraesha (sp?) (Only done this grouped)
Acrylia Caverns (solo or grouped)
Akheva (solo or grouped)
Maiden's Eye (solo or grouped)
Umbral Plains (solo or grouped)

I'm sure there are a few more I have forgotten, being as I have spent most 
of my time until recently in the four accessible planes due to the sick 
ZEM.

Not sure what will happen to which of those zones at level 62, but, the 
change that SOE is proposing to make regarding the change in level of mobs 
that produce xp will likely keep most of them viable for a few levels now.

Again, I would never go to those zones if my intent was strictly to xp, the 
ZEM, and likely the level of the common mobs, in the PoP zones means that 
nothing else produces xp as fast.
