Huh?  No fanboy comments visable by me.  He stated how DAoC dealt with a 
patch problem, did a compare and contrast with how EQ deals with similar 
problems and left it at that.  I'm sorry, but a statement of FACT is not 
fanboy, and a personal opinion that jibes with what probably 90% of us 
experience is also not fanboy.

Oh, how clever.  Are we (eq fans) so insecure in our choice of MMOLRPG 
that we can't handle a logical, dispassionate post that highlights how a 
competitor handled a certain situation in a manner that may be better than 
how Verant handles similar situations?  
I'm sure that you think that all the CS changes that Verant has made in 
the past 6 months to be a bad thing, since they may have been inspired by 
DAoC.
