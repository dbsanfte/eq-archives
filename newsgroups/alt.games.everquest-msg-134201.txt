I can't think of any cases offhand where it's open for an exploit, but I
can see where it could make life easier. In the old state of affairs,
you had to leave the "group leader" back at zone-in or wherever to
invite new members for CoH, since only the group leader could invite.
But sometimes during the raid it's nice to be able to have one person
disband, invite somebody for a group buff or whatever, then leave and
reinvite the old person. Now, your group leader can be on the raid site,
be able to do that with a full group, and still transfer leadership to
the bot back at the entry to invite new people into the mage's group.

Only one I can think of, though.
