According to a public post by Moorgard, the Community Relations Manager for 
EverQuest 2, a new wave of pending applicants has just been invited to 
participate in the closed beta including -- for the first time -- players 
who applied on the public sign-up site. Here's the post, dated Septeber 29, 
2004:

Hello all,

I wanted to post a brief update on how our beta test is going so far. Many 
Legends subscribers and Lords of EverQuest players have joined the program 
over the last several weeks, and we are pleased to announce that more 
invitations are being sent out today. These new testers will be coming from 
the pool of long-term EverQuest subscribers who applied for beta on our 
official website. Additionally, winners of the promotion with PC Gamer 
Magazine are being brought in as well.

The feedback we've received so far has been fantastic, and has gone a long 
way toward helping us make EverQuest II even better. We look forward to more 
invitations being sent out in the near future.
