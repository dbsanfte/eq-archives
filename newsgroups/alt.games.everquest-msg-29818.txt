I was at Gencon all 4 days and they DID get the tourney going. It had 400
people
4 at a time, and the surprise of the tourney (at least to me) is that one of
the 1st
round losers was the Ranger. They had 4 copies of the same account with 8
characters
to choose from. It was held on the Test server and the final winner was a
warrior. I did
not play nor did I spend a lot of time watching, but it was held in Arena
and seemed to
be just like dueling in normal EQ, long, somewhat interesting, and overall
somewhat ...
disappointing. I have only dueled 2 times and walked away from both feeling
cheated.
But, I guess that is why EQ put the rest of the game in, so they could be
something to
everybody.
