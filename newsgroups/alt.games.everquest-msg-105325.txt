It has no purpose afaik.  I asked that same question a long time ago
and the only answer I got was that it is too much trouble to change -
not worth it.  But if you don't believe me then test it.  Try to make
some change to your character and then /quit out and see if the change
stuck or not.  I think you will find that it is impossible to erase
any change by /quitting (except hotkey placement possibly).  If you
could then someone would find a way to exploit it.
