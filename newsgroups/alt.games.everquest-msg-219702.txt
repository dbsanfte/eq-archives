Actually you can guarantee it.

Tank taunts
Tank assists mob.
If mob is targetting chanty still, tank waits to taunt again.
Repeat until mob is targetting tank.

Wakey wakey.

It can take longer using this method but if you need to be sure it will 
work (eventually).  It's interesting to observe that sometimes only 1 
taunt is sufficient, and sometimes in the exact same circumstances 4 or 
5 are needed.
