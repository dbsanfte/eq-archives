Does sacrifice still work? I am sure you wouldn't have difficulty finding a
Necro who would be willing to sacrifice you back down to 47 (?) : )

Otherwise just tell people you are an ebayer, they will never believe the
father/son routine anyway - even if it is the truth. Get used to soloing for
a while but make sure you are extremely couteous and helpful to everyone you
meet. Before you know it a guild will find you and they won't care if your
rusty/clueless/ebayer if they recognise the value is in you as a person, not
just as a hand in a level 60 sock puppet.
