61 mage here -

Mage pets dual wield at 24, but you
need to arm them (with a pair of 
summoned daggers is fine).  At 39
They dual wield without weapons.

You should make a serious effort to
have most, if not all, of your pets.

Earth for mage root and nuke.  Problem
with earth pets is they do less damage,
and take more damage than other pets.
Advantage is they have more HP and root,
which allows you to burn things down.
Very mana inefficient per kill, root
messes up aggro in groups, and Earth
takes forever to regen naturally because
of it's higher HP.

Water, next highest HP (equal hp if you
have your focus stein from temple of 
Sol Ro.), higher regen rate, higher DPS.
Before the change to pet resists, it 
had complete immunity to poison.  That
appears to be buggy now.

Air, takes the least damage, good DPS,
stuns (high aggro, so it holds aggro 
well).  If you have the focus broom it
has 90% or so of the HP of earth.

Fire (my favorite solo pet).  Lowest
HP, inate damage shield equal to it's
level + 1.  You have to be careful
with this one, but if you master it
it gives the most mana efficient kills,
and gets to full health faster since
it has the least HP.

You want to get your focus items, at
least the stein and torch (for the
water and fire pets respectively).
They really enhance the pets.

heres some links
for pet info (incomplete, some was
lost when the Mage Compendium went 
down and the mage tower switched from
ez-board)

http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=3191

And the main link to the Magician's Tower

http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/

Ask stuff there, lots of VERY knowledgeable
mages.
