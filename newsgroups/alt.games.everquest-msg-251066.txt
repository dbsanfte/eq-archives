Focusing on criminal law, most all law is still to "protect" other people
from you.  Looking at the very basics, it's illegal to steal because it
harms the person being stolen from.  It's illegal to assault/muder because
it harms the person being assaulted.  It's illegal to drive while
intoxicated because it harms the guy you run into.  It's illegal to rape
someone because it harms the person being raped.

It's illegal to sit in your house and get stoned because...  well, that law
is stupid.

The vast majority of criminal law (and business law for that matter) is
based on Hammurabi's code.  All protections, not regulation of morality. 
Hammurabi was a smart guy.

Seems just as applicable to alcohol.  In the worst of the Soviet depression,
the government always made sure there was plenty of vodka to go around.
