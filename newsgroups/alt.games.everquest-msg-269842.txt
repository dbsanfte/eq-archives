Aye, they've painted themselves into the corner on this one.  Really,
I'm betting that the RL economic argument ("this way they'll have to
pay us for a second account") is holding sway here.  Given the goals
they've stated for tradeskiller game-play, there's no decent excuse
for them to not have a consignment shop.  Put a fairly stiff fee on
it if necessary (say 25-30%).
