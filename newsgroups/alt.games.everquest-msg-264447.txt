Absolutely.  

At the same time, the rest of us have the right to express our
opinions on folks.  And that includes remarking that they've got
nothing of value to say, and aren't really worth talking to.

And, just as a random anecdote of my own:  I got into a similar
argument with someone on the UO newsgroup over pretty much the same
thing.  I called someone was a fuckwit who wasn't worth taking
seriously, the other objected as much over the hostility as anything
else.  Yet within a month he'd come to the exact same conclusion
anyway.
