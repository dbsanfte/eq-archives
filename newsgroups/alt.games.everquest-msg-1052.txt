    I was just trying to figure out what everyone was feeling on this
change. As a level 30 paladin, It makes me madder than - lets just say it
infuriates me. Does any other hybrid agree witht the following statement?

DAMN THE PENALTY.  MAKE ME MORE POWERFUL SO I WILL GET WHAT I HAVE PAID
THIRTY LEVELS  WORTH OF AN EXPERIENCE  PENALTY FOR!

    I feel cheated, possibly because all along I assumed that I payed that
penalty because hybrids were more powerful. I am also feeling I should quit
my paladin and start a necro.
