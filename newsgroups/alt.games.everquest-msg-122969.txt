Yup.  I saw someone camping the solo spectre outside the cave to the Fear
portal once.  They were taking about 12 minutes after each kill to be ready
for the next.  Since the spawn time is 5 minutes 15 seconds (if I recall
correctly), someone else could have taken every other spectre and not slowed
them down at all.

I think it is reasonable to give some leeway, so if the mob takes, say, 9
minutes to spawn, and the person/group takes 12 minutes to get ready, that
is OK, or if someone is camping a named or higher level mob that is on a
longer timer, and is passing the time XPing off normal stuff, I think it is
reasonable to give them time to finish whatever they are fighting and fully
buf and med for the named or high level mob...but when it is a normal mob,
and they are leaving it up for longer than its spawn time, they should share
the camp.
