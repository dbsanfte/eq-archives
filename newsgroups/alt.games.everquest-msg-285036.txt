Hello All,

My character's name is Edyil, and I am a Paladin (70) on Antonius
Bayle. I have been looking for a good, yet managable, high level undead
zone to solo in (you know for those extremely slow grouping days). I
have my vanquish undead AA's, and I can crit undead pretty well. I am
trying to amass as much information as I possibly can on these zones,
so I can later compile and re-post, perhaps as an FAQ.

I have done a search on the groups (high+level +undead+zones), while it
brigs results on the topic it does not really get specific enough as to
the best undead zones (the information is all over insofar as levels
and class information).

Currently I have heard of and played a few (in-game) such as, Veksar
(not bad AA's for a 70 PAL to solo in),  the undead murkgliders in WOS,
I have also been to POH (Plane of Hate) which has some good mix of high
level undead and regular aggro. I have heard that Luclin has some good
areas as well, but I think these undead may be too low level to get any
real experience from (any confirmation on this would be great). The
Hole near paineel has some great undead foes as well, but the higher
level mobs are deep within the city, and sometimes it can get somewhat
tricky managing to get through the entire zone in a timely manner,
especially since a lot of those mobs seem to see through regular
invisibility (not sure about innate invisibility). The skellies on the
Maidens Eye are not bad to solo either.  I welcome any and all
suggestions on this topic.

Thanks,

Edyil 
L70 PAL, AB
