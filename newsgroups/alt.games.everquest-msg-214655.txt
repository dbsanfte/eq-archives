Hit points are the least important stat for anyone with SoW. Since shaman
get SoW earliest, you may want to think about alternative strategies for not
getting hit so much.

IMO: Try aggro kiting then. All you do is get the target to under ~80% and
have a DOT on them before you send in a pet/ranger<sic> with *no* taunting.
Yes, you will have aggro. No you won't get hit. Pet won't get hit either.
You may have to spice it up a bit with a direct damage spell to hold aggro.
If the target switches to the pet, you sent the pet in too soon.

Why it is a valid choice to use SoW to your advantage with a ranger or druid
and not with a shaman is beyond me. Just another play style.
