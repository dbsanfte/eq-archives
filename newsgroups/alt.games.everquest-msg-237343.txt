Not at all. See definition 2 below.

There are two interpretations to the word PvP server.

1) Player versus Player is the point.

People log in with the objective of killing as many other people as
they can. That is the point of the game (a la discord server). Just
like Quake.

2) Player versus Player is an option.

People log into a normal everquest world, except when a camp is
contested or a twit is trash talking or socially accepted behaviour is
not present the player base can self-police with PvP
combat/consequences. Just like the real world.

The trouble is the two groups don't mix well, and there is no clean
way of separating one from the other.
