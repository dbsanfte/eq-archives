I enjoy my necromancer.
One thing to always remember about playing a necromancer post level 53 your
role in the game will change by a huge amount.  High level necros have the
biggest shift in the learning curve.  From always a soloist to being a group
member.

So don't solo all the way to 54 and bitch because your class can't solo any
more.

I suggest using your strengths at lower levels to make friends and group as
often as you can.  In other words, always try and get a group.

You'll thank me later
