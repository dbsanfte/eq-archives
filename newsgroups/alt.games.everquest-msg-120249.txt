This one's NO DROP, so just /ooc to the zone if another newbie needs it
(this and Vial of Smoke are the 2 NO DROP parts of the Bard Breastplate)

Most of the new stuff sells to vendors for about 25silver... which is damn
good money to a char below level 14... and buys back for just over 5gold (so
it's worth collecting 2 of something you can't use, to buy something you CAN
use in your quest).

From what I've seen (I've completed 'good Warrior', Bard, Monk and am now
working on 'good Caster') the Freeport quests are pretty good, even if the
quality of the weapons does vary a LOT (from a very good Bard 8/30 1hs, to
the abysmal Rogue 3/21 piercer restricted to Innoruuk worshippers)
