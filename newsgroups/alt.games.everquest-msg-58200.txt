Lots to see out there. Most will say Lake of Ill Omen. That is a good spot.
South Karana for Aviaks. Lake Rathe has some good solo spots if that is your
preference. Unrest is fun too. Najena with a group is a good spot. You can
solo some of the beasties just outside the Evil Outpost in The Overthere.
The lizards at the entrance to Cazic-Thule would be good exp.

There are a few.
