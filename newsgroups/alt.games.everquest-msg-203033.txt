I have good memories of playing in Unrest with a chanter when I was a 
newbie.  That nice girl took the time to explain alot about EQ that I 
hadn't learned yet, she essentially taught me how to act in groups and 
what NOT to do when there is a chanter in the group.  I wish I still had 
her name, I've long since forgotten it.
Keep in mind, Unrest is a lowbie area and some of the people you were 
grouping with may not be very experienced, they may need some gentle 
instructions, just like I did so many moons ago.
