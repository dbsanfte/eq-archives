 As others have stated, the guide was following the rulebook in regards
to conflict resolution. (I haven't actually read the book but I'm
assuming that's what it says)

 In theory you could do exactly that. However it's considered a gimpy
thing to do and expect your guild to get a less than favorable
reputation if you pull that on every encounter.

>3rd, ragefire is now appearantly an official camp.

 It's always been First in Force on our server. 2 guilds can happily
park 12 members each and neither one has claim to it when it pops. It's
whoever engages first. Unless one side decides to petition. In which
case a gm will probably show up and have you roll with the loser having
to leave the zone for 12 hours or something.

 Good luck with that. Let us know the results. I'm guessing VI will have
no qualms with how the guide settled the matter.
