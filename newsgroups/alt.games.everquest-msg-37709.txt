	As you say, though, it is a major PITA.

	HAHHAAHAHAHAHA...dude, the Monk's don't GET anything better until they hit
Skyshrine/Kael quest armors.  Those boots are better than their PLANE armor.

	Monk loot is seriously FUBAR.  There are better all/all items than the
entire set of Shiverback.  Azure Sleeves are better than any Monk sleeves
except Kael and Mischief quest armors.

	Highest level mobs are the Titans, and I think the highest of them is the
Panda.  I've heard that one is blue, barely, to 55 (it was to me).

	Tanks are screwed.  A brave Ranger could solo here in from 22 on,
fearkiting animals, but would have to operate under "I Can't Die" protocols.
No heroics, no toughing out borderline fights, etc.

|Cheating is

	It's cheating in the strict sense that you are circumventing the rules.
