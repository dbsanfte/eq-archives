Looks like you just can't win huh Avenger...going after someone in real life
after you cried about it for soooo long.

Had to unkillfile you for the punchline...

Dear moron...that was ME that sent you the anonymous email with "my boss's
email address" because I knew after all your whining and bitching about
other people trying to get real life info on people and how you just didn't
care to waste the time...that you just couldn't resist the bait and would
send that email to that address followed by editing my repost of it
including my name and an alias email address that I setup on the
server...you are so predictable that it's pathetic. How weak you are, to be
so two faced that you feel the need to contact someones place of work
because you can't win an argument and try to get that person fired. I've
already informed the CEO of this company to expect some kind of outburst
from an immature psychotic stalker that might try to contact him as well as
forwarded several postings from this NG showing him your ramblings.

Welcome to my world amature...you've just been trolled...go back to the
kiddie pool minnow...
