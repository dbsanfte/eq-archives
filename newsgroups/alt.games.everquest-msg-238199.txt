Greetings,

I'd appreciate your suggestions of where I might solo as a 53 Paladin...?

LGuk is turning light blue, so it's time to move on.

I've got good DPS and have decent AC STA HP + quick heal and HoT blah blah blah.

Give me a C3 and I can pac-pull all of LGuk, no problem.  Magelo link below ;->

I have to solo, mostly because I can't count on being in-game for more than an hour at a
time.  I usually *am* on-line for longer, but I can't count on it.  I don't want to leave
an LDoN group hanging if I have to bail.

I have yet to go deeper into the Planes of Justice than to see the sights in Tranquility.
Yet, I hear that a player might be able to solo, carefully, in PoJ.  Something about trash
MOBs near the zone-out...?  And where might one find a good map of PoJ, anyway?  Is the
zone-out the same as the zone-in, or is it a Sebilis kind of ordeal?

If Illia's Bestiary is right, I won't be able to get much XP in HHK at this point.

The soloable parts of The Hole look like they might become light blue pretty fast, if
they're not already.  I dunno, I haven't been down there except for an aborted guild
event, and that was 2 or 3 levels ago.  We found that our target was camped, so we just
cleaned out the hallway MOBs, and bailed for Fear.  How can I get a key to the hole, as a
light-skinned Knight of Mithanial Marr?  Everything in Paineel will want me dead, dead,
dead ;->

So...where to solo as a 53 Paladin?

Best regards,

Tim ==
