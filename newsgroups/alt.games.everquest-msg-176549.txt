It is really up to you.

If I were you, I would wait until I had the "Dual Weild" and "Double
Attack" skills before concentrating on maxing all weapon types. Once
you have these two skills you will swing more often (double attack),
and you will be able to equip two different weapon types (dual weild).
It is much easier to raise 2HB and 2HS with double attack..
