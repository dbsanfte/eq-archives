The team at Verant, though they're not perfect, have done an excellent
job of addressing these kinds of problems.

Don't let him twink you any more, at least on the first character. The
game really is well balanced in terms of being able to afford what you
need when you need it at the lower levels. Part of the fun of being a
newbie, or even of having a fresh character, is hitting the milestone
of new spells, new gear, and so on.

Sounds like he did a thorough job. Understanding CR is key.

I've been playing for over two years, and EC *still* overwhelms me. I
often just turn off the /auctions if I know I'm going to be spending
any amount of time in there.

Lions are remarkably unsympathetic. My first character (a dwarven
warrior) got eaten by one of those the first time he set foot in EC,
and got to enjoy a nice boat ride for corpse recovery.

You will, one day. Bet on it :)

Loot everything. That's key at the lower levels. And look around for
merchants who like you - they'll generally give you better prices on
stuff.

At higher levels you'll regularly be getting many plat per monster. It
still won't feel like enough :)

>New players have recently started asking me for money. I feel horribly
>guilty about saying no

Don't. Don't feel guilty, and don't give them anything. Beggars have
become the true scourge of Everquest (much like the cheaters or PKers
of other games). They must not be encouraged, ever. They are the
lowest scum of Norrath, and if it were possible, I'd kill them myself.

Grouping is indeed very rewarding. Even knowing that, I still have to
force myself to get into groups (sometimes I'm just too damn crabby to
deal with people).

The Oasis is one of the most overcrowded zones in the game, for
reasons that I've never understood. Don't be afraid to venture to
other places when Oasis starts to annoy you.
