The new User Interface that is currently on the test server has 8
spells per page. The current interface still has 5.

If you are referring to "focus" effects, you do not have to do
anything. If the effect applies to the spell you are casting you will
see a message. For example if you have a Black Alloy Medallion and you
cast a spell you might see something like "Your Black Alloy Medallion
begins to glow" along with your normal spell message.

Velious is another continent. You can get there 1 of three ways...
1. Take the Boat from North Ro
2. Teleport from a Druid or Wizard
3. Nexus Spires (if you have Luclin)

Luclin is a moon orbitting Norrath. You get to Luclin through the use
of the large Wizard spires. There are 5 total (Toxxilia Forrest,
Greater Feydark, North Karana, Dreadlands, and Great Divide). You need
to have the Luclin expansion in order to go to the moon. At each spire
there is an NPC called a "Nexus Scion". You hail them and repeat the
phrase "I wish to journey to luclin". The Scion will give you a portal
shard, and you then sit and wait until the portal fires (usually
15mins).
