I had a D&D warrior that was dumber than a post (but with an 18 Charisma, go
figure).  He would go up to anty door, kick it in and stride right through.
That is, until the day a giant spider dropped on him from above.  From that
day onward, he would still kick in the door (no matter if it opened in or
out), but then would hold his shield above his head and pear up into the
room.  If nothing was seen, he would stride right in.  Until he fell in the
hole...

In other words...dumber than a post.  Or, like the French, always
well-prepared for the previous battle.
