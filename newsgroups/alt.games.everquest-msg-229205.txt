   I also like reading other rant boards, and I'm not sure why.  I mean, it's
not like I'm going to ever meet any of the people named.  But it is just fun! 
Lany's is pretty good, they have an actual Shit List that filters out the usual
ooc garbage that clogs most other rant boards.  But I'm going to check out
Quellios and Brell now too.  Anyone else know any good ones?

   I can speak to the FV boards.  For a long time, these were weak.   It was the
highest trafficked of the forums, and after it while everyone would post
anything to it hoping to get more views.  It was the de facto general board. 
However, the mods have recently cracked down on that sort of stuff, and they
have gotten amusing again.  Many members of the FV community do have a sort of
witch hunt mentality, and it can be fun when they got riled.  For example, in
one recent memorable case, someone posted the real name, address, and phone
number of an unrepentant griefer.  It somehow managed to stay up for a few hours
or more, and then we got the griefer coming back and threatening to make all the
people that were calling his house and talking to his parents pay.  Good stuff.

    In answer to the OP, I do post there from time to time, but I don't really
flame.  I tend to either give some leveled headed sort of advicey post, or make
some sort of joke about the whole situation.  Even if I have a real rant, I
phrase it in the form of a question.  This is what happened, this is what he
did, this is what I did, this is what happened next.  Was he in the wrong or was
I?  I also tend not to name names.  I have learned the hard way that rants can
boomerang.  Even if one has a legitimate gripe, the very act of "telling on"
someone else can make one seem like a whiny bitch.

    It might not make much of a difference when one is actually playing, I
suppose.  But still, I would rather have a reputation for being level headed and
funny, than for being a bitch.  YMMV.
