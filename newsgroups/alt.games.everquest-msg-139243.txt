}Eh, tried the hide sneak and it worked until he saw through hide.  But

So you can hand in stuff while hidden again?  Cooool.

}Now if only I could figure out what those !#$!#@ merchants want.  I've

Yup, that's a really sucky, boring quest. You may find it vastly more 
effective to turn in orc pawn picks to Hallard at Hallard's resales, EFP.  
It seems to be a much bigger hit, and the only drawback is having to lug 
heavy stuff from the merchants newbies sell them to. :)

}and my faction with the merchants doesn't 
}appear to have budged, even though I did the notes run once before so I 
}could train in the Freeport sewers.  Rogue trainer and her cronies are 
}now amiable, yet nothing from the merchants.  Bah.

I can't say for sure, but I vaguely suspect the gypsys in Oasis may be on 
a faction called 'Human', that you take a hit to for killing the fishermen 
near the east side of the oasis lake.  Hmm... actually, I know how I could 
test that.  It'd be a massive pain in the butt though. :)  I have two 
identical ogre shamans, except one killed those fishermen a few jillion 
times... They're both in bazaar and very encumbered though. :)
