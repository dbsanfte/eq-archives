Since Cavalier means "horseman" or "mounted soldier" I would suppose that
the ability to fight from horseback would be appropriate. How about this?
Instead of buying horses Cavaliers would earn horses with improved abilities
by doing quests. Fighting from horseback would dramatically improve the
character's ability to hit and do damage. Fighting on foot would be
disastrous (a Cavalier's armor and weapons would be designed for mounted
use, and so would subtract from DEX, AGI, and AC when equipped on foot. Some
items could not be equipped unless mounted. Many mobs might panic or become
demoralized faced with a mounted opponent, so a chance for debuf or fear
might be included in their attack set. With these abilities they would be
superb tanks, so to balance the character you might include a chance to lose
or lose control of their mount in combat, as well as a very limited set of
equipment options i.e. most existing tank armor and weapons would be off
limits.

This would be a more unique character, and not just another fighter/caster
hybrid.
