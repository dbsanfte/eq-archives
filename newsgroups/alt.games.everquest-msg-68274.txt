Except where that fight requires you to be the best in a certain skill.

Your scenario works OK in groups where absolute effectiveness is not
essential.  But at the high end specialisation is needed, because raids have
to be as efficient as possible.  This is the problem with having hybrid
classes - they are either too powerful because they can do the abilities of
both parent classes as good, or they are not powerful enough because their
skills from parent classes are not as good, and therefore the parent class
will be chosen in important encounters for the greater efficiency.

Personally I think Verant has started to realise this - that is why it is
now giving hybrids their own spells etc.  I also think it is why they put
Thunder of Karana in - to give us a unique ability.  But because of poor
testing they had a big blunder and then a knee-jerk reaction.  Just hope it
didn't put them off the idea of class diversification all together.

In my opinion there should be no such thing as 'hybrids'.  Every class
should be its own class.  And every class should have its own defining
skill.
