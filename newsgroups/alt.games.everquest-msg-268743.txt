I listen to you guys talking about the game and all I can think is, we
aren't playing the same game.  I have no idea what 70% of the things you
abbreviate are, even, let alone where they are.

I started EQ1 2 months after the game came out.  My highest character's just
made 58.  I bought every expansion up to Omens, but it's all useless to me
because I'm not in an uber-guild.  The furthest I've been is my current XP
fighting in PoN, PoI and such.

It sounds like the best gear I've ever owned you'd ignore as total trash.

More than anything else, your commentary here has pretty much convinced me
that it's time to shut down my EQ1 account and devote time to EQ2, where I'm
still at least within shooting distance of the highest characters (highest
are 33, I think, while I'm 14).
