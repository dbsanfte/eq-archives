So is there much content for someone who isn't level 60 yet, let alone
level 70?  I felt burned by DoN.  Though the Guild Hall and Lobby are
useful, and the bandolier is very nice, I really haven't been able to
see much of the new content.  I tried some initial DoN tasks to build
faction, but at my level (probably 55 at the time, I forget) there was
basically one task I had a prayer of doing (even with a friend helping),
and it was just too tedious for words.

I enjoyed reading Richard's description of entering a new zone for the
first time and not knowing what to expect.  But for me, what *I'd*
expect is to be killed in the first minute because all the mobs are too
high level for me.  I do like the fact that SOE is adding new content
for players at the high end, because I don't want the long-time players
to lose interest; having them still in the game is a big plus.  But I'm
sort of wistful that I don't think I'll *ever* have the "new zone"
experience, at least not since I've reached levels where soloing is
more trouble than it's worth.  If I go anywhere in a group, everyone
else in the group already knows all the encounters and what to expect.

And besides content, the other new features in DoD also look like they
won't be much use to me.  New AAs?  Ha, it'll be several levels before
I'm ready to accumulate more than the handful of AAs I already got.
New spells?  My monk'll love those.  Besides, the new spells are probably
all for levels 60-70.  Intelligent and evolving items?  Yeah, and you
probably find them only in the new zones, which are probably too high
level for me, and the items probably have required level 69 like a lot
of the stuff I've been seeing from DoN.

Anyway, I've decided not to buy DoD unless I hear there's lots of stuff
in it for ALL levels, not just the 60-70 crowd.  This does mean that
I'll be relying on reports from everyone else here to come up with a
summary of the expansion to add to the FAQ next time around. :-)
