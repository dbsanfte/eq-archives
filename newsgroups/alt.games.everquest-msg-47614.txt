The best place to sell such things as foraged vegetables or evergreen
leaves is the place where some desperate person is auctioning that
they will pay 20 plat a stack for foraged vegetables or like 100 plat
a stack for evergreen leaves. 

In otherwords, pretty much any zone that gets much traffic.
My druid has some such things way in the last backpack, so they don't
get eaten (the ones that can get eaten) then peeks when she hears
someone auctioning for the stuff.

Usually people wanting such things are not around when you'd be
auctioning them and when THEY are trying to buy them they are offering
higher prices usually.
