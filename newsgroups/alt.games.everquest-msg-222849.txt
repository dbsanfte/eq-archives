    There was a wee bug in Erudin. Killing a shark in the bay got you over
100 million gold.

    <time for that figure to sink in>

    The bug wasn't insanely exploitable - looting the shark would knock you
to character select screen, and you had to do some fancy footwork from there
to actually get the cash to the bank - but you only needed to do it once to
have 10 million plat. A few people on Xegony did it, then went on a buying
spree in The Bazaar, cleaning out almost all the high-end stuff available.

    Then the GMs noticed.

    All the purchased items were deleted, and the characters involved given
warnings. If the people who sold items to the exploiters sold over a certain
amount, they lost the plat as the GMs couldn't tell if the sales were legit
or not. (One raid guild had their spellbot sold out, then lost all the plat
to this.) So now you have a server with a fair chunk of new plat floating
around, but with no items to spend it on. Whoomp, plat devalued overnight.
Xegony is one messed-up server right now.
