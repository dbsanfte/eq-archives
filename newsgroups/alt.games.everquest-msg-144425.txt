Well, as you might expect, the Gnome is used as a ball substitute.
Punting is, of course, encouraged.  There is, however, absolutely
no restriction on the use of the players hands (well, excepting
those activities prohibited by law, which vary from location to
location and may or may not be allowed between consenting parties).
As to the use of a ball or balls, I've heard of local variants
but never actually observed them.
