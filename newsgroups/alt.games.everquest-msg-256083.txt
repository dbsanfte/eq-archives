A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the
name mlombarski@aol.com (Mlombarski):

>What is the delay on the weapons?

Delay is the rate at which a weapon swings measured in tenths of
second.

> Is a delay 38 slower than delay 30.  or the
>other way around.  

Delay 38 swings every 3.8 seconds, delay 30 swings every 3.0 seconds.
Therefore delay 30 is faster.


>Can bashing be improved with use or it is improved by training at a guild
>master only? 

It's improved with use, as long as you've trained one point in it
first.
