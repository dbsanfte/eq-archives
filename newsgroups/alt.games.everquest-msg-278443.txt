And there lies the crux of this whole thing. Corporations -want- to 
control the product far more than the law gives them power too. Software 
doesn't need an EULA any more than a warhammer model, dvd, or book does. 

Plain old copyright law assures the IP can't be ripped off and sold, 
reproduced, sold, etc.

That's not necessarily true. We should be able to agree without 
controversy that *None* of the visual elements are on the server in any 
form.

That leaves the character strings, the names of places and things, the 
dialog, and so on. While its possible some of these are on the server. 
Its possible that they aren't.

The names of NPCs for example could be on the client, the server 
database perhaps only contains "NPC-123", which gets looked up on the 
client to "Lord Negafen" or "a giant rat"...

The same could be true of any string of text, dialog, etc.

Finally, WR is largely an original work, with its -own- quests, and its 
own npcs, the zone connection maps are -different- than EQ Live, it has 
its own skills, tradeskill items, custom AAs, etc. For all I know its 
not Lord Negafen, but "Veldorag the Ancient" hiding out in the zone we'd 
recognize as SolB where we'd think Blackburrow ought to be.

Touche.

But its not quite the same thing one 2 counts. First the RIAA doesn't 
have any specific knowledge that you actually purchased the CD you are 
sharing, but that's not really either here nor there.

The real important difference isn't the idea of a company suing its 
customers, but rather the product tieing that's going on.

EQ subscription service is separate from the Everquest client box. They 
are bought separately. And its possible to have one without the other. 
The box only comes with a demo of the subscription. 

While SOE may think of them and market them as bundled inseparable 
products, that doesn't make it inherently true.

Be interesting if by suing their customers they could trigger an 
antitrust lawsuit for product tying. After all Ford can't sue you if you 
decide to buy triple-A instead of subscribing to their own internal 
roadside assistance program.

Again this is a bit unrealistic... but then legally binding contracts 
that dictate what servers you are allowed to interact with with software 
you bought is too. I'm just waiting for the day Microsoft pops a "Thou 
shalt not connect to mozilla.org into its Windows EULA...", and perhaps 
even blocks it via the built in firewall etc. ;)

Quite right.

Fortunately even if WR were deemed a fansite it contains nothing copy 
protected. (And I argued previously that the server itself need contain 
nothing that is protected as well.)

If the content manipulations are strictly id handling then it doesn't 
need to be in violation. Especially if the mappings from numeric ids to 
copyprotected strings and dialog are handled strictly on the client 
side.

There is a Magic the Gathering online game (not MtGO) that makes use of 
the text and card images from a software encyclopedia that WotC sold 
several years ago.

The game software contains no copy protected material, but users must 
own the encyclopedia to view the card images, and text. The game (unlike 
mtgo) doesn't enforce the rules, but merely provides a virtual card 
table, and then links into the users copy of the encyclopedia.

This software is legal. (Although it may contradict the encyclopedia's 
EULA, if they'd thought to put a term in there against accessing the 
card database and image files from software other than the 
encyclopedia.)

EQEMU servers are a variation on this theme.

I'm quite confident that there is no action that could be brought 
against WR that would stand up in court.

There *is* definately room for action to be brought against people 
playing on WR, as they are in violation of the EULA. 

However I honestly do not think that EQ can legally enforce product 
tying their monopoly on EQ client software to eq server services 
strictly via an EULA beyond banning them from live servers, which is the 
remedy the EULA specifies for non-compliance.
