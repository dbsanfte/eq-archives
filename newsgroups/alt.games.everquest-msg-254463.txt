Drinal here.

Last night I cast 3 temps- 1 for 40pp, another for 50pp, and the last(for
a warder) for 20pp.

Then again, both these guys had been yelling for a while while I was
banking/turning in parchments/etc, so when I hit my OOC spam button they
were abnormally happy.

The warder guy caught me off guard- I was thinking "What the hell could
this guy want this for" and asked him- *that's* how I found out about pet
zoning.
