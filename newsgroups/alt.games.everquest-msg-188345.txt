Could be a problem with your EQ installation. Running the eq file
check might help. That being said, personally, I used to have a mix of
win98se and XP on my network at home and had really bad networking
issues with the 98 systems (TERRIBLE packet loss). Once upgrading the
98se systems to XP, that problem dissapeared. 98 and xp dont seem to
get along in some cases. Could be XP's internet connection sharing
causing the problem with 98, not sure.
