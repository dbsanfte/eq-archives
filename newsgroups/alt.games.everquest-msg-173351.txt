Yes, that was my epic (and also why i avoided SoV for as long as possible..
damn spam).  It wasn't reflex tho, its tied to my flykick hotkey.

I dont typically exp with an enchanter (read never) so im hesitant to remove
the macro.. but on raids all I get is SoV (or group version).. there is
hope, though!  A chanter recently came back from retirement, and still being
60, can only offer VoG!

As for the weapons.. im sure theres better combos (20/19 omfg!!) but they've
been killed by 1 guild in all of EQ.. so still kinda out of my grasp :)
Theres nothing else (1hb) that Id ask for before im seeing loots like that
drop
