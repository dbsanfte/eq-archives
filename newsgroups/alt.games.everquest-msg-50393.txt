I thought it was compulsory? I certainly am going to leave the group with a
post of
"EQ Sux0rs, DAoC R0x0rs" Until SoL comes out and then I'll come back and say
the opposite and deny all recollection of posting otherwise.

I think, giving Zone populations, that EQ has suffered the least, DAoC
prolly has a lot of brand new players and ex EQ/UO/AO players that had quit
anyway. AC is apparently suffering.

The finished article of DAoC looks impressive whereas the screen shots, IMO,
did not. Makes you wonder what SoL may actually look like when you see the
models with proper animation.
