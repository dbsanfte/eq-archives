The FT works from level one, and the stats aren't bad by level 24, plus
they will keep getting better and better as you level up.  Heck, I wish
the reccomended level was 65 so it would keep getting better past 51!
Well, only if the stats at 51 were what they are now, and the stats at 65
were really incredible... but still.

Only because they sell to a vendor for this much.  Besides, at 24 a cleric
can reasonably get in a giant group and loot her own in a day or two's
hunting.

All interesting items, but far more important to any caster are Focus
items; for a cleric, mana preservation, extended enhancement, improved
healing, extended range, and depending on play style, improved damage and
burning affliction could be interesting too (yes, the undead dots at the
low levels have a pretty poor ratio, but if you are playing root and rot,
thats what you have to work with... and with BA they wouldn't be quite so
bad)

MP is even better than FT 1... FT 1 does give 50% better standing mana
regen, but much less than that sitting, which clerics do a lot of, and MP
gives the equivalent of both 10% more mana regen and 10% larger mana pool,
except on Complete Heal which she won't have for ages yet.

The other thing I don't see anyone mentioning is a mount.  Get a pony or a
Drogmar, the latter is a little more expensive but with practice really
lets you see a lot better and do more.. down side is the movement is much
worse.  Either, though, will let you sit (as far as mana regen is
concerned) any time you aren't moving or attacking, including while
casting spells, and to never get sit aggro, even while swapping spells
around.  They also give you "getaway" speed, although movement on them is
annoying and impractical in short hops, if you have to run to zone you
will build up to "faster than mobs" speed soon enough that they can
usually save your life.  Sadly, if you spend most of your time indoors
this won't work out, they are useless there.

Another thought, TBoots, with good charisma and faction, run about 5Kpp,
or you could get a JBoot MQ for about the same, which is better if you can
find one.  Either will give you "faster than mobs" speed, which is handy
for moving around and not getting killed even in groups, and almost
essential for soloing.  These will also help move thru indoor zones, but
the duration on the buff is short enough that they won't benefit you
indoors for long camps.

Hmm, I assume you already have a charisma of 106+, but if not, a key item
for clerics is the Opal Encrusted Stien, at 25 charisma for roughly 25pp,
one or two of these as needed will help a lot in buying goods... and when
you get higher in levels, you'll find the 10pp a shot cost of symbols will
make a decent charisma interesting no matter what your income level.
