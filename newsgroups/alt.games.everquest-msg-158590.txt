Others have touched on part of this, but a good explanation of the
biggest problem that Tarre is talking about has to do with the "melee
box". For those not aware of it, each mob has an invisible melee box
around them. This is the maximum range you can be from the mob and still
engage in melee combat with it. It's not the same for all mobs, but
*generally* is relative to their size. (I say generally, because there's
a couple bigger ones with frustratingly small melee boxes, such as some
shardwurms in GD, but they are easy enough kills that it's not a huge
issue.)

As a necro, you're in a good position to see the size of any mob's melee
box. Why? Because good ole' Jabober is far more efficient with his
energy expended than any player. Pets will *always* attack a target who
is stationary or moving away from maximum range. They dont' run up any
closer than they have to in order to start swinging. If you rooted a mob
and had a necro at the four compass points, N - S - E - W, and then sent
in all the pets, from an overhead view they would show you the size and
shape of the melee box. 

Some mobs have simply HUGE ones. The wurms in Skyfire are a good
example. When we first started duoing there, I'd pull wurms for Tarre
and be thinking, "Hrmmm... what's this? Jabober on a coffee break?"  But
no, there he was, off in the distance backstabbing his little heart out.
The wurm's melee box extends past the end of their tail (and that's a
BIG tail) so you can hit them from a huge distance away from the body.

So, on most single group xp outings, or small mini-raids with only two
groups, you can fit ten or so fighters on any mob and this won't be an
issue. But against a huge dragon size mob you need to fit twenty or
thirty melee on them. If you suddenly turn it into a skelly, now it's
melee box shrinks to skelly size and only ten or so melee can it hit.
You've just sliced your raid's DPS down to Jack Squat.

On top of that, for some mobs like Kunark Dragons, the casters can only
land spells from melee range. If it goes skelly, you've just cut out the
rest of your damage.

And a even a minor decrease in DPS can spell disaster. Last night we
took yet another crack at Trakeneon. (Only Kunark dragon our guild
hasn't killed.) We lost yet again. *sigh*. But we had Trak down to FIVE
FOOKING PERCENT when the last person went down. If somebody had skellied
it, it wouldn't have even been close.

Side note: I was dead when Trak was at around 40%, but the last ones in
reported that Trak got to 5% and seemed like his health bar just froze
there. Very odd. And very frustrating.
