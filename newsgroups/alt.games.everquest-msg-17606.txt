Well I to field of bone with my level 12.  Took along time, went to warsilk
woods got lost... stayed lost, yea lost still.  But a friend found me and we
got to field of bone.  Excellent spot, moved into Kurns tower.  Excellent
spot.  Had to leave at 18 to get my spells but went to lake of ill omen.
Use invisibility to run though Cabalis (sp?) I swam to work on swimming and
just in case I began to reappear.  I suggest you do not go though the
warsilk.  Just run though the iksar town invisible.  I suggest you create a
iksar and get used to the city.  Do this only if you are hell bent on going
to kunark now...

In the end stay away till about 18 then goto Lake of Ill Omen.

Hope this helps a little.

Brandon
