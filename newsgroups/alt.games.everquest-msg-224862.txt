I was in a little PON group last night, two necromancers and me, a 52 
mage.  Pretty simple stuff, lead necro hate kiting yard trash with our 
pets in tow and us providing nukes and DOTs to hasten the kill as well.

Worked for well over an hour, me sitting on my lizard with KEI couldn't 
get my mana bar under 60% no matter how hard I'd try; the necromancers 
kept having to take med breaks just as I'd start to get down there 
finally.

One idea would have been for them to take turns being the kiter, so the 
other could get some rest.  Another would be for them to stop casting so 
much, kills would take a little longer, but we could contantly be 
killing.  A third idea would be for -me- to pull the kite string, but 
clearly I wasn't generating more hate than them even doing my best to 
chain nuke out my mana bar.

I did get run 3, not unexpected since I had only a yellow to go when we 
started, and the exp was decent if not particularly great (due to the 
lag between kills and the longer lag every third kill... exp per kill 
was nice at 3%)

Shortly afterwards, it finally happened.  A recently pulled blood raven 
was headed past me, I swung pet into action, layed in a nice Char, and 
boom, it veared and stopped at my feet, pecking like mad.  I ran 
forward, slapped the Taunt button, but the thing stuck to me like glue 
chewing a hole in my back so it could get to the tasty kidneys inside 
while my mount slowly accelerated... top speed still wasn't good enough 
to overcome the raven's desire for a main course to go with his fava 
beans.  About eight seconds had passed in that slow "I'm about to die" 
way important things have of happening when I got my mouse cursor over 
to the buff icon for the mount and clicked it off.

Boom, like I'd taken the parking break off my dusty old dodge omni 
accelerated, stopped doing the camelback hump, started taking curves 
smoothly.... and more importantly got just enough extra speed to get 
those raven claws out of my breadbasket.  I was at 13% hp, too low to 
actually lose the birdy no matter what anyone did to it (well, a root 
would have taken it off me, or a fear... but both would have rapidly 
created trouble, our pets can't tank those things and fear just sends 
them off to get help, which is plentiful outside a narrow band around 
the wall to both sides of the graveyard... I doubt anyone had either 
loaded).  So I did my bard imitation and just ran a nice tight loop 
around the necros in the middle.  Not tight enough, cause one of the 
necros started a HP transfer 4 times before finally getting it right... 
but that didnt' matter to me really, now I was out of range of beak and 
claw and I was going to keep running laps till the nasty thing died.

I don't have JBoots, lived thru the nasty 1 to 52 years without them, 
and now I dont' need em.  The lizard, which has saved my life a couple 
times, has always been hit or miss, I died to a frost giant elite right 
outside velks after outrunning him across half of GD; I had a head start 
while he finished my pet, but apparantly he was gaining on me the whole 
way across the zone.

Would run 2 have been adequate to the task?  Perhaps.  I didn't get 
aggro while I was still at run 2.  I'm reasonably sure run 1 wouldn't 
have been, since I'd have lost some speed at 13% hp.  At any rate, Run 3 
was my goal, and I'd just reached it in time to see it pull my biscuits 
out of the fire, which it did with a vengeance.

Splendid One, 52 Gnomage with Run 3, halfway to Baron (the good half, 
like regen 3 is going to mean anything close to this), Firiona Vie
