I've done my research on LCD's and have viewed many at the stores. You 
are spreading FUD dude. Here's a short list of what makes CRT superior 
overall.

CRT Positives
1. colour quality
2. contrast quality
3. response time
4. multi resolution capability without using interpolation
5. no dead pixels
6. a lot cheaper than an LCD

CRT Negatives
1. large footprint
2. power consumption
3. heat output (related to 2.)

LCD Positives
1. sharper text and line art
2. small footprint
3. less power consumption
4. less heat output (related to 2.)
3. makes a good fashion accessory

LCD Negatives
(read CRT positives)
