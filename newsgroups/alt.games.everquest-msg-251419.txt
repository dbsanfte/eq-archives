Did they let him go? I am assuming the Pole they took was a male, but
perhaps Smedley got bored, and needed some "company".

I hope they took into account the thouights of the Americans. Maybe
the Euros that play, but I rarely see people from Eastern Europe play,
much less Poland.

Look at the fourth word, role. Nobody plays at a role. EQ has become a
big mini-max character optimization fest, with a few notable
exceptions. This has lead to dumbing down of the game, with no rhyme
or reason. We have add-ons on top of add-ons, and there is no logical
reason for it.

Lets take the stones. Lets examine the stones in Qeynos and Freeport.
I assume in days gone by, a merchant would have to have a dang good
and profitable reason to travel across the Karanas, brave the passes,
run through Kihticor, and hopefully pass the Commonlands. Now, a
merchant can just take the stones. No caravans, no paid guards.
Norrath should be having a severe economic depression about now.

Lets look at the problems with the merchants in the PoK and
SHadowhaven. Now I can ruin my faction in every city and it isn't a
hardship at all. I can be a criminal killing guards, and doing as I
please, because I can always sell and buy in the PoK. I recall a time
where I used to sell food to people with ruined freeport faction, and
I spent a lot of time factioning so I could enter freeport and N FP.
Now, I have no need to go there. Why would I care that my faction in
city XYZ is bottomed or maxed, there are few exceptions, and I can
always fix faction at uber levels by PBAOE!

I think people are just bailing, and seeing what is offered. I know I
have not been playing, in favor of a new RPGA game I have found.

I think CoH is attractive to a lot more people than I ever imagined.
Perhaps I may be going my self. If I do, then Yes, YCHMS because
IWNOWIA.
