I was bored this evening so I went to Blackburrow to watch the Newbies pull
trains.  <grins>  As it turns out, I did very little watching and quite a
bit of corpse retrieval for those people who were tricked into entering that
tree.  Why on earth do some people think it is funny to kill new players
like that?  I've wondered about it for awhile now, but tonight I really got
a taste of how easy these new players are talked into things.  I was lucky
when I started playing that I had someone to tell me, "Don't go in that
tree.  It is a trap, you will die."  I never went in there until tonight.
LOL  Then, I ended up going in there a total of 7 times to pull bodies out.

It was funny in a way, and I was bored and loved doing it as it gave me an
excuse to wander around Blackburrow in places I had never bothered to go
before, but still...

Have any of you ever gotten a newbie to do something that gauranteed their
death?  Just curious as to the reason why...

I'll end my rant now...  hehe  Have a great rest of the weekend folks!
