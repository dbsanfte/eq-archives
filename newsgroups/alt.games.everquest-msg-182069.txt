To avoid 'sploits or exploits. Mob AI is not smart enough yet
to think within the 3 dimensions that we can, when viewing our
computer monitor. A human player can easily say "oh that doorway there
or that hallway is the means of following that entity ahead of me!" A
creature does not have AI that can compute that, instead they have
"beeline" Ai. They see you and move towards you.

If doors and walls and things acted like them, a player would be able
to round corners and such and trap mobs on one side then easily
killing them from afar. So its easier to not worry about making an
insanely smart AI and just make the creatures ignore obstacles.

If you ever played UO, you'd remember how trivial it was to trap
beasts with simple barrels and such inside your house, then using them
for practice dummies. That is what happens when you trust AI to
challenge players and navigate obstacles.
