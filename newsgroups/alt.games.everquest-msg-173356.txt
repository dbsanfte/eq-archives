Only just yesterday.....Wizzipoo 7th level in East Commons kills a DB spider
and sits down to med.  Feeling pretty cocky sh jumps up, roots a cat and
starts nuking.  Uh oh-root breaks.  Wizzi runs back to her best buddy Guard
Restlin and he beats up the bad kittie.  Sit down to med.  Jump up and try
another cat.  Root, nuke, nuke,  it's looking good.  Uh oh here come a
spiderling.  Run the spiderling back to guard Restlin while cat is still
rooted.  Get back to cat and uh oh-root breaks.  Grrrrr-run back to guard
Restlin.  Sit down, med up.  Jump up and try a Scarab this time.  Root,
nuke, nuke, nuke  ok I'm gonna get some exp this time.  Uh oh-root breaks.
Ok no prob full health this time I'm gonna channel thru a Root this time I
just know it.  Root, Interrupt, Root, Interrupt, Root, Interrupt  -see a
pattern here?  LOADING PLEASE WAIT
