I kinda find that hard to believe.  Verant treats songs and spells almost
identically the same (the only difference that I'm aware of is bards can
"cast" while running).  I trust you to only speak what you believe is the
truth (otherwise I'd never use your great programs) but if you (or anyone)
happen to know of a non-Verant site that can back that up I'd love to see it
(and probably do something about my bard's dex).
