Yeah.  The other thing that was rather bogus about that article was that
he barely mentioned Shadowbane (mostly just to say if you mentioned
Shadowbane you are an idiot), and I didn't notice any mention of DAoC
at all.

Not talking about Shadowbane is absurd, because Shadowbane for so long
was the Great White Hope of the PvP fans.  Even if it has failed at that,
he should talk about it and say what it did wrong.

Not mentioning DAoC is also pretty silly, considering that it is (1) very
successful and (2) the whole freaking endgame is PvP.  Note that there is
also a DAoC server that is full PvP for people level 10+, and that server,
unlike the EQ PvP servers, does not languish at the bottom of the server
population lists.  Given this, it seems to me that if one is going to whine
that none of the current MMORPGs are handling PvP right, one should at least
take the time to explain what is wrong with the one that has PvP and has
nearly a quarter million subscribers.
