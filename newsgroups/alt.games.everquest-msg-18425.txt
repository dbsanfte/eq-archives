There was a new change included in the last patch
that was not mentioned in the patch message.  Note
these faction messages I got when doing the Neriak
Red Wine quest last night:

[Fri Jun 29 19:53:39 2001] Lokar ToBiath says 'Ah, yes,
   let me pray to our god.. Yes, Innoruuk has given me wisdom.
   A Scribe of Dal still exists, disguised as a barkeep in 
   the Blind Fish.  This information will not help you though, for
   she has sworn a [vow] of silence and will not speak of the Dal.
[Fri Jun 29 19:53:39 2001] Your faction standing with DarkBargainers
   could not possibly get any better.
[Fri Jun 29 19:53:39 2001] Your faction standing with DreadguardOuter
   got better.
[Fri Jun 29 19:53:39 2001] Your faction standing with DreadguardInner
   got better.
[Fri Jun 29 19:53:39 2001] You gain experience!!

Check out the second line:  my faction "could not possibly get any better".

Woo hoo!  For a long time now, those of us who spend time on faction
quests have wanted a way to be able to tell when our faction(s) had
maxed out, so that we could know when further faction work would
be fruitless (or conversely, so that we would know whether further
faction work could be worthwhile).

With the recent patch, the faction messages you get in the game
now let you know whether you're maxed or not.

They also let you know whether you're bottomed-out or not.  I
didn't get any myself, so I can't provide the exact text that
is used to indicate this situation, but a necro-killing guy
in the same zone reported that he was getting messages something
like, "your faction standing with so-and-so could not get
any worse".

This is a VERY welcome change.
