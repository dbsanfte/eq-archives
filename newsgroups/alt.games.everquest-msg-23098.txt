}- Make the chat windows in IRC style.

Heh, you mean make it in mIRC or Xircon style... There's a humongous 
diversity of irc clients available.  The one I use, (or used to use before 
I got hooked on EQ... :) ) ircII, just dumps everything in one window the 
way EQ does.  I wouldn't mind them spewing everything out into different 
windows, as long as they also include a way to turn that feature back OFF!  
Personally, I really wouldn't want A_beggar_00's latest /tell to pop up in 
a whole new window just when I'm trying to target something that needs 
mezzing.
