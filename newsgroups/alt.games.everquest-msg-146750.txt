I had a drowned citizen hit me with Disease in WPF yesterday. I was on
my way through the boat-to-BB-to-GFay trip to catch the spire port to
Nexus (anyone know a quicker way to a Nexus spire from FP, I'd
appreciate the info.). I made it to the Bazaar (having played my regen
song while waiting for port/travelling/etc.) parked my butt to sell
some stuff I had accumulated and went AFK to watch the ballgame on
television, forgetting that I was still Diseased.

I came back about two hours later to find myself standing at my bind
point (yep - WFP) amidst a pile of my own corpses. It seems these
drowned citizens (having been trained from the sewers no doubt) had
been waiting on me to die while I was AFK in the Bazaar. I obliged
them as Disease got the better of me and proceeded to succumb to the
cycle of: spawn at bind point/get stuffing kicked out of me by
citizens/...rinse and repeat. I lost 2 full bubbles of xp at level 13
and thereby level 13 itself. I ended up having to loot like 5 of my
own corpses right there, purely to avoid humiliation, since all my
gear was on my corpse in the Bazaar.

In hindsight, it was kind of funny recounting events with the baffled
onlookers who tried to help my non-fighting-back butt each time I
popped back up for more. /sigh...lesson learned. At the time I
couldn't remember having ever seen a corpse in the Bazaar.
