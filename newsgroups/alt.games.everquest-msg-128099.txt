I like the idea of having *one* spot where it's possible.

That way if you want to browse the "for sale" items, you just
go to one zone and check it all out at once.  If this were
possible in multiple zones, then you'd have run all over checking
out the Bazaar PC Traders, *and* the EC Traders, *and* the 
Gfay Traders, *and*...

One-stop shopping (and selling) is good.
