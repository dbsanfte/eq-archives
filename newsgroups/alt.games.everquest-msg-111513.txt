Imobilize costs way too much mana, if you start using that instead of
root, you'll be OOM in no time. I use good old root all the time.  I
wouldn't think of going anywhere without it memed as ANY class that gets
it.  I occasionally use Enstil for the long hold time in certain
situations, but I still have root memed at the same time.

Some areas you can't get back from the critters, but casting root is
usually enough as it then attacks the closest pc.  I did have a problem
with root this last week.  I cast it on a critter that was beating on my
party's shaman.  unfortunatly the shaman just sat there and took it,
others were trying to get it off, but it wouldn't go.  didn't have time
to tell the shaman to back off, I resorted to stunning it, which saved
his life, but he was down at the point where no red was showing on his
health bar.  So do be careful what you do with it.

Primary is enchanter too - 53.  I wish I could retrain the tanks.  just
root things before breaking mez, then you don't have to spend all day
taunting them before breaking mez.  I've been in a couple parties I
convinced to do this and it worked wonderfully.  I hardly ever get the
nasty beat-down any more.

IMHO it's best to have only one designated slower. This conserves mana
and effort. I have found however that shaman tend not to pay attention
to wether they are designated or not, slowing when someone else is
designated, or not slowing when they are.  I also don't slow all the
time when I'm designated, as the spell takes a long time to get off for
an enchanter, if the mob is more than half dead by the time you get it
off, you aren't doing much besides wasting time and mana.  If you are
wasting either, then you are wasting XP.

Um what lv are you?  When you get to 50+ and something tripples you for
150 each strike, it only takes 2 or 3 swings to find yourself dead.
