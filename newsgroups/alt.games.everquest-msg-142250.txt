My warrior had one blue bubble left of 39 and was in OT. I havent
played her in ages and my wiz bought a velium swiftblade and a wurmy
for her. I ooc'ed for a group and I got one just to the right of
ledge. I was tank and puller, with me was a shaman, 2 wizards, a mage
and a bard. It was the fastest pulling exp group I have been in for a
while. I did the rest of 39 and all but half a yellow of 40 pulling
low blues in about an hour and a half. Then bard went LD, one of the
wizards and the mage left. They were replaced with a chanter and a
paladin. Things started sucking quickly. Paladin broke mezz, dead
chanter. Got adds from wandering mobs and everyone had to zone twice.
Ahh.....it was fun while it lasted.

By the way.....when I was playing a cleric (still do when
rezzing...hehe) I would avoid paladins and rangers like the plaugue.
Was just plain awful in DL with 2 rangers, 2 paladins a cleric and
druid. They get hurt so fast I'm having to superior heal right as they
return to camp with a mob...turning its attention to me....and with
druid nuking away didnt leave much mana for backup heals (druids still
do keep a heal spell memmed right?....right?) Why on earth do people
play paladins anyway? must be for roleplay reasons. I have a paladin
too but never leveled him past 2nd.

So druids having a 75% heal is just plain worthless if they spend all
their time playing wizard. (i AM referring to Dr00ds mind you)
