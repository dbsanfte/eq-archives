Hello!

So I'm running back and forth between the Warrens and Erudin trying to build
up Peacekepper faction by taking the note from the prioners to Leraena
Shelyrak in the Temple of Quellious.. Anyway - the other day I get to teh
Temple and she isn't there. No prob I think - someone must have killed her
or pulled her to the zone line. She's not at the line so i leave it.

I've been back several times over the past few days and she still ain't
there! WTF? She either has an incredibly long spawn rate or there's
something screwed somewhere. I petitioned a GM to ask if it was broke but
all he said was he didn't think so - have a nice day. Useful...

Anybody else missing a Leraena Shelyrak? I'm on Zeb and wondered if it's
just my server or everybody? I noticed somebody posted under her details on
Allakhazam's Bestiary that she was missing on the 18th but he didn't give a
server.

She's needed for a couple of quests which get a bit more tricky if she isn't
there!
