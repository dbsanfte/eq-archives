Let's see, I've been playing EQ for about 3 years now, and my current
highest character is the first I've ever even taken to KC.  And I didn't
notice any one way arrows, nor the time I spent on the north wall before
moving inside did I see any spam that alludes to "everyone knows trains go
right".  Don't seem to recall reading it on any of the sites either...so I
guess we are supposed to be telepathically linked to "expert" EQ players
like you and automatically know what to do when new to something?  It never
ceases to amaze me how "some" people, not all, think that because people
choose to play things different than themselves, they must be
"noobies"...and just the use of that term and spelling to me implies K00l
dOOd...please try and understand that everyone playing the game is not there
for YOUR benefit.  Maybe if you tried logically explaining such a desire as
you wish trains to go a certain way, folks would cooperate.  I know I
respond much better to someone who is sincerely trying to help that to
someone who resorts to name calling and condescending comments....just my
.02....
