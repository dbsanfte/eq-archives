A lot of people have mentioned getting a rez or res when you die - keep 
in mind this isn't really necessary (or realistic, considering the cost) 
for quite a long time.  I've had *one* res (no exp, just gets you back to 
your body) for my level 19 shaman, and that was only because I was 
fighting in North Ro, forgot to bind myself, and when I died found myself 
in Rivervale at 10pm - to get back would mean running through Kithicor, 
apparently a very BAD place to run through between 8 pm and 8 am.

You haven't mentioned whether you're interested in a blue server (player 
vs EQ) or a red server (player vs player).  Lots of differences between 
the two, from what I've heard (I'll stick to blue, thanks).

When you start a character, and if you don't mind spoilers, go get maps 
for the zones you'll be fighting in, preferably ones that list the locs 
of certain safe places (guards or zones).  First things first: learn to 
use the /loc command - it'll give you a string of numbers that tells you 
where you are.  I didn't learn to use this for quite awhile, which was 
incredibly stupid, since I started out in G Fay - I can't tell you how 
many times I ended up wandering blindly and timidly through orc centurion 
territory shouting "I can't find my corpse and I'm loooooost" (thank 
goodness there was a very nice boy there to help me out - multiple 
times).

Lots and lots and lots and lots of other advice, but you'll probably read 
that as you go through the newsgroup.
