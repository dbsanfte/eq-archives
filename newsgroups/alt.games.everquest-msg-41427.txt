Not aggro? I would like to think that a great many of those green mobs
would be happy to assist us against the boss mob.

Problem is, the raid team leaders have not only been doing squat to
maintain faction; they've been actively working to lower it. I expect that
is a large part of why we got aggroed in the first place (it is never a
good thing to drop from scowl to glare, not when a few mobs on that
faction still con red.)

S I G H. If only there was someplace to turn in belts, maybe we could find
some realistic solution.
