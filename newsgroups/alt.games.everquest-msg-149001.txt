Been playing a little over a year. Had two bags full of stuff poof on
a cancelled trade once. Had all my stuff back within two days with the
help of a very courteous GM. That was my only incident of GM relations
thus far.

There are going to be bad experiences with everything, and those bad
experiences are going to be screamed of from the mountain tops. Rest
assured, there are a *great* many more people quite satisfied with EQ
than not.
