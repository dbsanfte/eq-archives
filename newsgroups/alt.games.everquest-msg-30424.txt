That'd be a faux pas alright. Bring it up to Absor. I'm quite certain that,
storyline
aside, one of the reasons that LFay went back to normal was because of all
of the complaining about how it broke the paladin lance quest (or whatever
it was). The squeaky wheel gets the grease. Out of curiosity, what quest and
what item is it that the TLC prevents you from getting?

I can sympathize with this reasoning, especially since they seem to be moving
more towards story-telling quests than simple "fetch X and Y to get Z" types.
The investigator quest in Qeynos is a good example. I got killed doing it once
but I'm going to try again soon. Not because the badge is so wonderful but
because it's fun to arrest people and it will be cool to say that my character
is an Investigator. (Too bad you can't SEE the badge!) A level 50 would breeze
through this quest and, with TLC applied, potentially be unable to complete it.
So, yes, that's something to worry about.

Still, I have to assume that the developers have some sort of a clue that a
quest like this will appeal to a wide swath of players and so design it in a way
that the TLC wouldn't apply. That's the difference between what's come before
and what's new: The entire area is being designed from the bottom up as a TLC
area.

Look at the Warrens as an example: The "prize" items are TLC-limited but the
"story" items (i.e., the loremaster scrolls that tell the story of Clan Kolbok)
are not. Any level 50 who wandered through the Warrens, exploring and killing
stuff, would find the scrolls, camp them all if he wanted, and even turn them in
for the quest. The only thing he can't do is get the molars and get the
low-level "prize" loot.

My advice to a high-level would be to wait and see. Let the other players buy it
first and listen to the early reports. The FUD might be right-on and it may be
completely wrong. Only way to know is to find out from other players. Anything
before then is just speculation, however well-founded the speculator might
believe it to be.
