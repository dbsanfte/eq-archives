Yes. Well I was right. I didn't get far at all before those lizards attacked

Worst thing is that my necro can find the corpse with the spell, but I can't
actually see it anywhere or use /corpse to summon it for some reason it's
too far away. Looks like it's inside the rock or something. I think I'll
have to petition this one.
