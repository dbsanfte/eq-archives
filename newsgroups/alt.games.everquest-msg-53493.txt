My wager, since they said they want to appease both camps ("the yeah I
want to xfer to the UK server" and the "NO I want everyone to be newbs
on the EQ server with me"), is that they WILL allow people living in
Europe to xfer to it with their current characters but I bet they can
xfer NAKED only. That will kind of partway appease both groups since
yeah people got to xfer over at high level but only a few would do it
since they were naked and they'd not have an outrageous Equip
difference with the newbs (at least not for a while.) 

Mostly a good thing about that would be it irritates people to be
on a new server where you can't get things like the old guise or mana
stone and other people have them. That is why I'm betting no
equipment.

I also bet you still have to pay to xfer.
