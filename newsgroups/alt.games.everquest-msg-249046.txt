(Adding back in the excised bit:)
Adam was busy demonstrating that he's got no idea of the difference
between accusation and insinuation and I was instructing him.
Further, he specifically asked me to explain the difference ("Explain
how you think insinuation is 'different' from accusation.").  This
offends you how?  You prefer him ignorant?

As far as I know I haven't kicked over any of your sandcastles lately,
so I don't know why you're being so bloody impolite.  So to respond
with your own lack of couth:

1) I never claimed the moral high ground.

2) You didn't answer the question.

3) If you're going to quote, don't quote out of context by selective
snipping.
