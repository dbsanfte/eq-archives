The two times the bind will generally fail will give you two different messages.
When you get the message that you are "protected" from Caster_01 trying to cast
a spell on you, such as bind, it probably means you weren't in a group with
them.  If you aren't grouped, you can't be bound.
  If you get a message saying "You can't seem to find an affinity for this
place" (or words to that effect) it means you're in a zone where you can't be
bound. For the most part you can only be bound in city zones. (GFey and Highpass
being the notable exceptions in the old world, where you can be bound anywhere
in the zone.)
