Is it just me, or does anyone find it a bit strange when
people start advertising for guild members? Why would
anyone who is starting a new guild want to have a bunch
of random people of unknown skill or integrity in it?

Maybe it's just that some people feel a need to show
their  guild tag as a status symbol. A typical example:
I'm banking in Freeport and someone tells me, asking
if I want to join his guild. Instead of the half-dozen
smart-alec remarks on the tip of my tongue, I simply
reply that I'm not interested. He comes back with
"why not?" Well, I'm still feeling polite and instead of
saying "I don't know you from Adam, why would I join
your guild?" I say "I'll probably join a guild when I
have a group of friends that I enjoy playing with on
a continual basis." He asks if this is my first character,
to which I reply in the affirmative. His closer: "You
shouldn't be so choosy, in that case."

Now the truth is that I solo most of the time and I
really don't have any aspirations of guildhood. Regardless,
I can't see that joining some random guild is going to
somehow raise my status to the point where the
"good guilds" will see my worth and invite me to
join THEM.

Am I missing the boat on guilds? How many of you
got recruited as part of an "ad campaign" and how many
of you are still with those guilds? Does your guild tag
confer any real status to the "influential" players in
the game?
