I had a Linksys that never worked well with Everquest.  I tried
everything I could think of, and I went to technical support for help,
but it never worked well.  I replaced it with an SMC router and that
router worked out of the box.  I never have to reset the SMC; it just
WORKS!  The Linksys needed constant resetting even for non-gaming use.

I recommend you replace your Linksys with an SMC.  You will be /so/
much happier.
