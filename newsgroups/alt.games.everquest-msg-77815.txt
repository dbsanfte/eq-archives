Druid snares immediately, now "when things look like they are taking
a turn for the worse"  If indeed you -do- have trouble rear its ugly
head outdoors, and the mob isn't snared, don't worry about stopping
to do this, just run... SOW will beat most mobs to the zone line by
a country mile.

SOC for escape?  Unless you are fighting some fairly rare mobs, SOW is
more than enough, its always on (outdoors) and you don't have to stop and
cast it... not to mention not wasting a slot on it.  I don't think I've -ever-
seen
anyone cast SOC as anything but a parlor trick.

Actually this can be a very efficient combo, as clerics have high efficiency
heals and monks are good at not getting hurt much.  CHeal isn't going to
be useful, but honestly its not a very good heal till you get a 55+ warrior in
your group.   Monk can single pull, which is one of the biggest problems
a duo has, duos are at their best with one mob at a time.  For exp grind my
cleric would rather have a monk than most anything... although I'm not sure
a monk wouldn't rather have a druid or shaman.  If the cleric can snag a
Donals Vambraces then this becomes almost comically effective.  Cleric has
mana to spare to send in UHOF!

Well, at high levels the duo heals up to 70% health using bandages, then
wades into the next fight.  As long as targets are killable by using no more
than 70% of each partners HP total then the rest time isn't really all that
awful
