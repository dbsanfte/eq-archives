So if they're camping one week, want to take their kid out flying a kite 
the next week, and want see Return of the King the week after 
that...they can go 'inactive' on wednesdays??

Of course not. I specifically said I wasn't concerned about one-time 
events like a death in the family imposing a lengthy absense. I'm 
talking about members who *consistently* cannot maintain 60% attendance.

That's a decent policy, actually. Providing X isn't terribly large. Its 
odd that you neglected to even ballpark it though. ??

A bucket of RPP isn't worth much if you aren't allowed to spend it. :p

50% consistent attendance is pretty good. Even 33% is still an asset to 
the guild. We aren't talking about one raid a year here after all. Maybe 
they aren't as 'valuable' as the 90%ers but then I'm not suggesting that 
they get an *equal* shot at the loot, but rather a proportionate shot at 
the loot.

Nobody is talking about 'as likely' we're talking 'no chance at all'. 
I'm quite comfortable with 'not as likely' for 50% attendance.

Most guilds worth joining have similiar dealios.

Most peoples zeal wears off a bit, often months later...perhaps they 
find an alt they really enjoy and spend 1 night a week on that and 
suddenly they 're only making 45 or 50% attendance...or maybe they join 
a hockey team that plays tuesdays and thursdays and they drop to 
consistent 40% attendance... these things happen, often.

And in response to your other post, you are right, I did take your 
'policy' out of context, and slam it. But then again I wasn't criticisng 
your guild per se, but merely guilds that have a policy like that, 
without mitigating policies to equitably deal with members who only 
almost 'measure up'
