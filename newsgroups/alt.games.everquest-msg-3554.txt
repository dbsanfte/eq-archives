This was on Cazic Thule, an old moeny server, and now on Ayonae Ro, a
split server from 3 old servers.

I dont care what server you are on, there is no way HQ bear pelts are
worth less than 3 pieces of fine steel sold to a vendor =)  Sooner or
later EVERYone  wants 10 slotters, and the raw material to make them,
HQ bear pelts, are as rare for lvl 60s as they are for a group of 6
level 5s taking down their first bear..

Tailoring, imo, is the ONLY long term viable, profitable, trade skill.
Tinkering may be too, but not everyone has 20k needed to get good at
it to start.
