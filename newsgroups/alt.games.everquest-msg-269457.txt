Are you comparing to a twinked character in EQ1? Did you have gear, buffs,
potions etc.... that made soloing easier? That would come close to making
them comparable in terms of the time.

I guess you have to average out the time over all to level a character solo,
not simply compare one level to another. I know it's FAR easier to level a
character to 10 in EQ2 than in EQ1. I leveled my first character in EQ2 to
10th level in about 6 hours. Part of that time was spent looking around and
figuring out the various commands and wondows and stuff. I could NEVER have
levelled a non-twinked (not that I ever had the resources to do major
twinking anyway) character to 10 in 6 hours in EQ1.

Does it really slow THAT significantly when you hit 20 in EQ2?

What about finding a good solo camp? Since there are multiple instances is
it easier to get a good camp without waiting around or travelling so much?

What about MOB aggro? At lower levels at least there are far fewer MOBs that
aggro, so is it easier to find MOB's to solo like it is at low levels?

In the lower levels there are all those random exp bonuses, like "You have
found the Stone of Kaladim!" DING! Do you still get those into the teens and
20's?

So far I really like EQ2. I hope you are wrong about soloing because I
really like to solo and so far that's one of the things I like best about
the game at the lower levels.
