You keep arguing this point, then use it in opposition of an idea that
a newbie shouting for help will get PK'd by an opposing group. I ,and
I am sure most everyone, will NOT exchange ICQ numbers with the
opposing groups and then use THAT as a way to ask for lost newbie
help. Your logic fails here. The possibility that one on your team and
one on the other are corraborating to isolate newbies exists, but how
long will they do this when they continually wind up in jail? It is a
self solving paradigm.
