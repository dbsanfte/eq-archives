    As a caster I don't have trouble with the AoE. ;-) Keep him pinned to
the wall, facing away from where the casters are, and have someone spam Cure
Blindness on the MT. With the other wall of the staircase behind the MT's
back he won't get knocked back too far. Just have to keep him pointed away
from the casters at all times, or heals start getting interrupted and things
go downhill fast.

    Itraer Vius always annoyed me because you were always worrying about
adds and being on the right side of him. Now that's a pain in the rear.
