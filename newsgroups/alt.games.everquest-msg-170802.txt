Aloha,
    Forever I have been able to raise my begging skill with my pet. After I
raised the skill to130, nothing...Well the other night as I past by the
theater in Freeport I thought of giving my old friend Janam a try. Sure
enough after spending months in the Karanas begging my pet and going no
where I went from 130 to 135 with that rogue merchant. A friend of mine told
me that once you hit 130 you can't beg your pet "for awhile". He wasn't
certain how long it was...Does anyone here know?
