    You betcha. Korocust has already been killed by a single group, and
dropped (amongst other things) boots with Flowing Thought II AND Improved
Damage IV on them. It will be perma-camped until the zone is removed.

    If the item attempted is 200 or more points below your skill, you will
never fail it. I don't know about any other skill range and if there's any
changes there.

    The damage increase is random from tick to tick. So, on average, the new
focus reduces the amount of extra damage done by 50%. Whether this works
because you never saw full duration on DoTs anyways or not is for you to
determine.

    I'd use it with my monk in certain places. It's all a matter of having a
clean kite path and a mob that doesn't run that fast.

    Every class has some misplaced spells. Surprised that some of them
weren't changed, too.
