Yep.  You can see Sang's old posts on the subject.   Dragonsbane is a 2000
point damage spell that  generates an insanely low amount of aggro.  A DB
equipped wizard will definetely be outdamaging the rogues.

The downside is that Dragonsbane only works on dragons with over 100,000 hit
points.  So there are no targets outside of velious, and not many within
(ubermobs in Temple of Veeshan is about it) that it can be used on.

With normal spells, the wizard doesn't do anywhere close to as much.
