SUVs that fall under the category of truck are allowed to pollute much
more than cars.

Cite your source of evidence.

Coal power plants are horrible polluters.  I'm in favor of nuclear
power.  How's that for an environmentalist?

Since the U.S. is operating at a horrific deficit, you're effectively
just borrowing that $200.

That's nothing more than speculation.  It's not a fact.

I said "we", not "you".  The U.S. has no right to accuse anyone else
of ruining the environment in some kind of self-righteous manner.

Who said anything about slicing the pie?  I wasn't advocating an
economic model.  This particular sub-thread is about SUVs and safety.

The economic model thread is down the hall to your right.

The amount of money the U.S. funnels into welfare is tiny.  Your
reaction is an overreaction.
