At least according to the Sony boards, they are still "considering what
to do" and know that they aren't going to please everyone. I think that
implementing the AB server to make life easier for the Euro players is a
great idea and a good service to their customers. Sadly, it's going to
be a clusterfuck as to *how* to implement it when it goes live. I
certainly can't think of a good answer to suggest.

Do you *only* allow people with a European billing address to play
there? Or only let them transfer characters there? Find me one single
guild that has *only* European characters, with no asian, north
americans, etc. For that matter, find me one primarily North American
player guild without a couple of Euro players. What are we/they to do?
Give up our/their friends so only Euros can transfer there? Tell a bunch
of European players with level 50+ characters that they have to start
over?

It seems that the only "fair" way to do it is to just start it as a
fresh blue server with no transfers allowed for three months like their
previous policy. The primarily Euro guilds would have to wait a few
months to move over, but any new Euro players could start out on a
server more "tech friendly" to them, and if established players really
did want to start over, or at least make an alt, they'd have that
option. Again, that's not an ideal solution, but it seems the most fair,
or at least "equally unfair" to me.
