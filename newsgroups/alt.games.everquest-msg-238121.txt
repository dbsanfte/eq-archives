And *all* of them are KOS in all the places the spell is sold?? And
none of them have Illusion or Faction spells/songs/potions/friends??
Now we're back to really having to try...

If its that bad, pick your highest level green-farmer from your 8
slots (monks & bards & pet classes are all great) and go farm greens
for a day or so to fix your faction. Its not the end of the world or

Paineel for example is next to the warrens... you couldn't ask for a
better place to faction.
