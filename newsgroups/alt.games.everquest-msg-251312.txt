Slowed?  Not that often, I don't think.  Remember, it has to actually 
hit to take DS damage; misses, dodged blows, ripostes and so on don't 
count.  The only mitigation that doesn't also reduce the DS damage is 
the kind where each blow lands for less damage; higher AC on the tank, 
lower STR or maybe attack for the mob.

That aside, 2700 damage a minute will take 7 minutes 24 seconds more or 
less to kill that mob.  Thats a long time, IMO... and given that the mob 
has been dishing out a hit per second, probably for around 500 a pop, 
we've had to absorb 222,000 points of damage incoming in order to dish 
out that 20,000.
