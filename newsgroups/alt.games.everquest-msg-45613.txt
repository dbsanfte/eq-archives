  Bleah.  Overpopulated, most of the time.
Don't be afraid to go to the Steamfont Mountains.
Loads of good hunting there, and easy to get to.
Just turn a sharp left when you zone from GFay to
Lfay, then run along the wall till you get to the
SM entrance.  If you see a brownie scout on track,
avoid it.  If you see a brownie scout in person,
enjoy the ride back to your bind point.
    I have know idea why SM seems to be so under
utilized.  It's a great low to mid level place to
hunt.
