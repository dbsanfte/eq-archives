Velious was the melee expansion. Serious gear and weapon upgrades and
ofcourse Primals for tremendous dps boosts. Casters got shafted so bad it
took several classes a year or more to become balanced again (mages were nr2
damage dealers in kunark, they became coh bitches and rod-whores till pop).
SoL was reasonable for casters with several high AC mobs where nukes and
dots got through ok. It gave Vengeance for melee and as usual more clickies
(about 80% of all mage non-pet summons are on clickies, so much for a class
defining area). Also ofcourse AA's which, despite all the complaints, are
pretty good for tanks. Also don't forget AE taunt which made defdisc rota's
more easy.
PoP brought the use of insane damage 2-handers, furious bash for shields and
a hate proc weapon for all (any guild capable of routiniously killing Kunark
dragons can take Xanamech, or at least almost).

Won't mention LoY considering that was a mid-level expansion and no classes
got any better from it.

Now tell me where did warriors get nothing?
