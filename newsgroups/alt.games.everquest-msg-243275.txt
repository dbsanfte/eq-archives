The difference is that you don't have an army of people taking camps giving
me and my twinks plat.  You don't see so much plat being given away that it
drives up prices to unreasonable levels and screws up the in-game economy.

Because plat is being sold for money, huge amounts of it are being
generated.  If there was no cash return - if it truly was a matter of just
one player giving another player some plat - then we wouldn't have this
massive mudflation, the nerfing of good cash spots (like the guardian camp
in Seb) because of farmers, a myriad of other little things that have made
life more unpleasant than it needs to be.

Who said ruined?

Show me anywhere in my post where I said plat farmers are ruining the game.
I said they are doing damage to the game, and I believe they are.  But the
game is far from ruined - especially for me, since as part of a high-end
raiding guild I have almost zero need for plat other than to do some
tradeskilling when the urge hits me.  But there is still overall damage to
the game, and I truly wish SOE would fight the plat farmers tooth-and-nail
rather than cozy up to them.
