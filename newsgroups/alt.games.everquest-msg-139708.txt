    Which is really too bad. One of the features tradeskillers have been
begging for is larger "in stock" lists on vendors. If the system has to
remember what a vendor has in stock (and it does, you can verify items sold
to a vendor are still on the vendor after selling a lot more junk to them)
anyways, what is the difficulty in displaying it?

    There's also other "issues" with stuff in the satchels. Apparently if
you have an unpriced item in a satchel, all priced items after the unpriced
item won't be picked up as saleable. The system is great right now, don't
get me wrong, but it still needs a few tweaks.
