Dunno, what class do you have now?

I spent hours upon hours in HG farmin so I could buy my kei scroll when I
hit 60.

At lvl 56 I could make 3 to 500pp per hour with my animation pet.

I can make more than this sometimes in certain zones  charm soloing named
mobs, but then I have the hassle of  the occasional death and selling the
stuff. I dont trade for various reasons.

Now I can sit in nexus and on the odd occasion make 2kplus per hour in peak
US times so long as there is no competition which there invariably is so
money will drop to 500pp or less per hour, which is when I give up.   I
don't have a minimum donation like some do ( stick 50pp in trade window for
invite blah blah) I will take whatever ppl can afford, and if that's nothing
then thats fine too.

But ultimately I want to make back the plat that I spent on it, which I have
now so I don't sell it much anymore. Far more interesting things to do :)
