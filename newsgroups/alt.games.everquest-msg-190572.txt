Well, I must say that my initial question has sparked a rather interesting
thread.

As I've mentioned earlier the guild in question *knew* that their name
couldn't be /who alled.

I did bring this matter to the attention of a GM, and I have to say that the
GM was very surprised. Whether the guild will remain un-who allable is
another thing. I'll keep you posted.

Regards,

Stevie.
