Nope.  You channeling skill determines that.

About the only thing AGI will do for you is give you a *little* higher
AC.  Get someone to cast an AGI buff on you (Shamans are good for this)
and you can see how much your AC goes up.  It won't be much, and you
will generally not care about geting +AGI stuff.  Usually, the only time
it is worth worrying about AGI is if it is below 75.  The curve for the
effect of AC on armor is very flat up to 75, takes a big jump at 75, and
then is very flat again out to something like 125, then jumps (but not
nearly as much as the jump at 75), and then is flat again.

DEX will determine how often procing weapons proc.  It's not going to be
a big deal for a Necro.

All you really care about are INT, MANA, AC, HP, and resists, plus
possibly some STR if you have trouble carrying things.  STA affects
HP, but like AGI and AC, the amount is small, so +HP items are more
important.  AC is important for casters, because casters *do* get hit
now and then. :-)  You can't get anywhere near what melee classes, or
even WIS casters, can get, but you can get enough to make a noticable
difference.

Note that the above is just for INT casters.  The tradeoffs for other
classes are different.  Perhaps, say, Warriors can get enough +STA to
get significant HP, because they don't need a lot of INT items like
you do.
