I used to have one of those hotkeys myself. And in earlier levels,
they are pretty much necessary. Before your 40's and 50's, the chances
of channeling a root, or even a stun, are small. At lower levels, if a
mob aggros on the Cleric, he needs someone to get it off of him.

Into the 40's, and certainly 50's, this is no longer necessary, or
desired (not by me anyways)- at least in the context of LDoN. In some
of the Planes, and GoD, it doesn't really matter as by the time you
realize the Cleric (or other caster) has aggro, he's already dead.
