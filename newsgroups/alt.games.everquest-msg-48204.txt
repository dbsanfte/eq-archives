Ok, now I'm not totally unrealistic. I understand that not every mob
drops everything on its loot table every time, and some drops are
obviously rarer than others. But I'm starting to wonder about the red
dragon scales from Naggy.  We've killed this sumbitch three times now,
and I haven't even *seen* the thing drop! And yes, I know I have to roll
against a bunch of other tanks for a shot at it, but I'd at *least* like
a *chance* at it. Or failing that, at least see <somebody> get the
freaking things!
  Bad enough that yet another of the pieces I need for my epic drops off
some fucking monstrosity that takes and army to bring down, and you can
only get a shot at once every couple weeks if you're lucky. But is it a
RARE drop to boot???? Sheesh. And they say the hand of the Maestro is
even worse. How do warriors ever get their freaking epics???
