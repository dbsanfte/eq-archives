Your right, I should try to be more adult and use the "F" word when talking
about Canadian Skaters. Yup, that's being mature for sure. Nice job Lokari,
thanks for the lesson.
 Kinda funny how it works. You try and stand up to me, but when you get
hurt, you call me childish to avoid being embarrassed and thus giving
yourself a way out.

 Try this Lokari-
"GetsumJ just leave me alone because you scare me"

 Just gotta ask. I see it and I will prolly back off ya. Until I see you
pounce once again on some person who had something to say and you felt the
need to probably embarrass the guy with you assault.

 Me ? LOL You and your dipwads won't bother me at all. I am here for the
underdogs, and promise I will antagonize the hell out of these
self-proclaimed EQNG Gods for beating on innocent posters.

 That goes for you too Bizbee and Dan. Too me, your punks and I have no
problem telling you so. Take your best shot, you'll end up blocking me like
last time:-) Either way, I shut your mouth for you.

Gotta problem with that ?  Didn't think so.

Now try and have a nice day.
