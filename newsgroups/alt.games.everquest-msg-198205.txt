Sounds much more cinematic than realistic to me.  A lot of those fancy
gymnastics moves (like the forward flip you mention) look to me as if
they make you mighty vulnerable to attack, hardly what you'd want to
do in a real combat where people are hacking and slashing desperately
with real weapons rather than following the choreographer's direction.
Not that I think that's the wrong way to do the animations in a game
mind you, just seems silly to call it realistic.  Too bad I probably
won't be able to afford a machine that'll run it well.  :/
