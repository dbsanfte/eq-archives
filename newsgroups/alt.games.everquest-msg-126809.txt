Same, but... why the HELL didn't they implement that for the face change 
characteristics??  My screen is quite dark (yeah yeah, I know, 'buy a 
new screen' - hey, I just finished buying WinXP and more memory just so 
I could play the damn game again!) and when the head rotates to the 
back, all hair colors look black to me - so I have to sit there and wait 
for it to slowwwwwwwwly rotate back to the front again.  At which point 
it speeds up and goes by fast again as I frantically click colors ;)
