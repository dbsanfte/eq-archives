sounds like you do have a lot of room to work there, with higher hp mobs at 
higher lvls...that's great...

i do get my first serious poison dot in 2 lvls, so hopefully things will 
shift then


also, i have another question - i was told that same-type dots will not 
stack, but i'm almost positive i've landed heat blood and boil blood (both 
fire dots) and seen their damage land concurrently ... so is that new? or 
was i hallucenating?
