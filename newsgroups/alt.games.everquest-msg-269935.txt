Working on Enchanter Epic 1.5 and need to do the All Seeing Eye piece.

How bad are the AEattacks.  Is there a good strategy to take in
the fight. How many people will my guild need to send in?

Any information you have would be appreciated. Links to maps and/or
walk throughs for the fight would be great. I am in a medium size
guild and getting a nice raid like this together takes some doing. I'd
like to be able to get the kill on first pass and getting repeat raids
if we get wiped bad will be hard. 

Thanks in Advance,

Ken
