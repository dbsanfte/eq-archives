What was he killing?   You say raid.. so i assume you mean
Klandikar/Sontalak/the other ones by ToV.. and they have some pretty huge
faction hits...

The other stuffs arent too bad faction hits, but then they aren't really
raid mobs (60 shaman and chanter have solod them)

I'm max kos to CoV now so I don't notice anymore... but I think one time
when we killed Klandikar and Sontalak together in a day (plus maybe the
usual one or 2 Crag adds) I dropped from Max Ally to Indif
