There are *some* places where you can get away with it. I team up on
occasion in the Hole entry with a 52 druid in our guild and we do "ok"
as long as I don't get any wild double or triple pulls. (The elementals
there are low to light blue.) Pulling a crusader/warrior combo is out of
the question, though, as she simply can NOT heal that much damage.
However, with Tiru, that pair of mobs is trivial. So, yes, you could do
the Druid/Warrior combo past fifty if you were *very* careful, but the
uses get darn limited.
