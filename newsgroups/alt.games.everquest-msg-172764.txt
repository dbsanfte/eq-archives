Hi!

I, too, used to think that the graphics in EQ were lousy.  I then
tried AC2 as the graphics looked brilliant.  They are.

However, thr graphics take up so much processing power that even my
high-end spec machine was fighting the environment and I felt that I
was fighting the User Interface.

So, I went back to EQ and I am glad of the extra depth that EQ offers
even if the graphics are rather simplictic.

I am not sure how you can say that a rogue's play is the same as a
mage.  These are my two main characters and they seem to have nothing
in common in terms of game play.  Well, after I learned not to try to
backstab with the mage, that is.

Anyway, whatever you decide to play in the future I wish you the best
of luck.

Malc
