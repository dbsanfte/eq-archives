Thanks for all of your help and suggestions. As it turns out, there was no
simple fix. I tried everything suggested and it didn't work. In fact, I
completely reinstalled the game without removing the downloaded files first
and that didn't work either. The only thing that finally worked was to
completely delete the Sony file and reinstall as if I were a new player.  Of
course then I had to download all the patches, but it worked. I'm now back
up and running.
