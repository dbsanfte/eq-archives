Mana song was greatly appreciated.  I -was- capable of mezzing most mobs, and if
having one mob at a time to fight instead of two isn't of benefit to your
group... well you really aren't working hard at all, are you?

You didn't see me hitting mobs other than for lack of anything better to do, I'm
quite aware that my damage output isn't going to matter much at all on those
targets.

I was capable of hasting and slowing and boosting dex...

But by far the most useful thing is amp soothing mana mana mana mana soothing
mana mana mana soothing mana amp... pour on that mana as fast as you can, mister
DJ.  This mana regen stacks with every other sort of mana regen in the game, with
the partial exception of another bards'.
