Yeah, I'd imagined that the way it worked was a forum where people could
be put up for consideration and a seperately maintained list (perhaps on a
web page) based around the consensus of the server population in the
open forum.

On that basis its down to individuals to judge the validity of a name
being put up in the forum but.... uhm... well thats just total speculation ;)

As I said, TT doesnt have anything of the sort, so I suppose I could be
completely wrong.

Maybe the original poster will come along and clarify how it works...
