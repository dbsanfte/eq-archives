I'll agree with SingSang about solo xp'ing there.  I tried doing the entry
room at 39 with my mage after I heard about what amazing xp is was.  I gave
up after making a three kills, getting killed two or three times and  having
several close calls (only escaped because I was right at the zone line).
When it was all said and done, the kills didn't net me *that* much
experience, certainly not enough to justify the risk.  The worst part is
that because of Kedge's layout you can get attacked by something
considerably higher or lower vertically than you are.  You can get pummeled
and just scratch your head trying to figure out where you were attacked
from.  You can't move backwards through water unless SoW'ed and even forward
movement is cumbersome.  Everytime one of the fish hit me, he knocked me a
good bit backward.  If you're a melee class, I would imagine this would be a
huge disadvantage.  At 54, you'll need to get past the entry fish - I'm not
sure if they'll aggro you regardless of level.  Here's a link to a KK guide.
Good luck if you go.

Unfortunately, I don't have any great ideas for where you can go,
particularly soloing with a monk.  You could try Sun Revs and Tro Jegs on
the plateau in Scarlet, but the Revs proc a curse that could be painful.
You could try SolB, but at least one of the mobs (duct crawler?) procs a
nasty heat based (I think) DoT for 800hps.  Maybe with good resist gear you
could avoid it.
