Browsing playerauctions.com (mentioned in another article in this
newsgroup), I saw this Infinite Platinum guide that makes the claim
that you can make about 70pp per hour with a level 4 character that
can go invisible.

I'm sure someone here knows the technique.  I'm curious what it is
and if it works.

I'm not sure I'd want to spend an hour just trying to make platinum
if there weren't something else interesting going on, but it would at
least be interesting to hear how it's done.  Or is this just a scam
to sell worthless how-to guides?

This link to the specific page on the how-to is:

This is *not a spam endorsement*.  For all I know, this is just a slick
scam.
