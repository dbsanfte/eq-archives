I have a real problem with number 4 . You would just not believe the junk
that has been in my system. To give an idea i will just say that I upgraded
a zoltrix video card for a 3dfx blaster banshee pci several years ago. I
went through a hd that went bad after 9 monthes. 2 bad modems . 3 bad cd
players (well one was a cdr). On the bright side if I had to deal with
proprietary nonsense along with all the bad parts I probably would have
killed someone .
