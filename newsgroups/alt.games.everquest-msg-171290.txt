At these lowbie levels its better to just shrug and bear it unless it
becomes a real problem (like someone practicing low weapon skills in a
place we really need their damage). When you get back to the higher
levels you can start expecting people to know what they're doing, and
the rest of the group to back you up. In the 20s, though, you're more
likely to be ostricized for being anal retentive.

It wasn't MY group to control, unfortunately.
