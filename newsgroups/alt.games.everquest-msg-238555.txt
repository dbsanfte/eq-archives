If it means anything, your post helped me.

I never really seek out relationships online in the first place, I play eq
to play eq and not to find a girlfriend, but this just reinforces my belief
that nobody online is who they claim to be.  does that I mean I wouldnt talk
to someone im grouped with about music/tv/whatever else comes up while we're
killing giants or something, nah, I still like to make friends. but I
definately have no interest in persueing anything outside of grouping and
killing stuff.


Plus, about 2 years ago, one of my brothers friends met 2 women through aol
that were local, I dunno the details of what all happened but apparently he
met up with them at least once to have coffee, and for whatever reason they
ended up with his digital camera.. I dunno the details of that either. but
we all eventually found out that the girls were BOTH 14, and this guy is
like 38. he had no idea but once he found out he broke it off immediately,
and the girls were stalking him.. calling him every day, every night,
talking about how in love they were with him,  somehow the parents got
involved, and not much longer the police. it turned into a big mess for him,
and last I heard he STILL hasnt got his camera back.


So, I just avoid the whole thing entirely. you never know who you're talking
to, could be the best friend you havnt met yet. could be some crazy rednecks
with guns.  (no offense, crazy rednecks)
