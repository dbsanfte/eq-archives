As (bad) luck would have it, I managed to die in Lower Guk last
night (soloing the Ghoul Lord is *not* a good time to go LD...)

After getting back to my corpse, I had no luck finding a Cleric.
I could 75% rez myself, but at 57 I'd rather try for at least 90%.
So it was a good time to try the "camp to preserve the rez
timer" technique.

I had my Bard twink in the zone on another account, so on a
nearby computer I moved him to where my Paladin's corpse
was and used him to watch the Paladin's rez timer.

Results of a few quick tests:

   Rez timer continued to tick down after camping to
   the character select screen.

   Rez timer froze the moment I hit "exit" from the
   character select screen (even though it took me about
   30 seconds to get back to the server select screen).

   Rez timer restarted the moment I hit "enter" from the
   server select screen.

   Exiting back out of the character select screen caused
   the rez timer to immediately freeze again.  Timer
   reading was 1 hour, 57 minutes, 55 seconds.

   I brought the Bard back in this morning in the hopes
   of spotting an early rising (or European/Asian) Cleric.
   No luck, but the Paladin's corpse still reads exactly
   1 hour, 57 minutes, 55 seconds on the rez timer.

I'll try again this afternoon and report back what I find.
