In order of getting the item:
1) centi ss from the first guild I joined - ahhh brings back memories
2) lesser guard of haste, & some ry'gorr stuff - from someone who was
leaving the game, I was around 18 and passing through GF - he said he had
been watching me help some others out and I obviously didn't have
anything...(don't know if it was a complimen or not...hmmm.) so he gave his
stuff to me.
3) wazikashe (?sp) of the frozen skies and moonstone ring - from a pc I hung
around with for quite a while, we became good friends and guildies
together...*sniff* I don't see him on much anymore though
4) Reed Belt - my bf gave it to me in-game for Valentines Day (the gift that
keeps on giving!!)
