Well, now you have.   The groups I am in tend to do it that way on a regular
basis.

And it only takes you 10 minutes to put together a group and get going?  You
must be very fortunate indeed, as that doesn't even come close to resembling
my experience.

And at level 55, how many adventures do you have to do to earn that Vengence
IV augment?   Over 100.   But if you go for the experience instead and level
up to 60, it only takes 60 adventures.   Go for experience again and get 65,
it only takes 30 adventures.

Seems to me you're the one that would be prolonging the wait, if you were
doing it in my shoes.

Aside from that, until I can start raiding (at level 65), I won't have any
gear worthy of putting a 1500 point Vengence IV augment in it.  What is your
plan, put it in the 10 ac, 10 stamina, 34 percent haste RBB that is my best
item at the moment, then just earn another 1500 points once I grab one of
the 41 percent hasters and a real belt?
