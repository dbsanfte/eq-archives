Same problems here with my SB Live. No problems with other games or audio
apps. Also when it rains, RAIN is the only thing I hear! This just started
happening a week ago. Sound in EQ was working just fine on XP before that.
I'm not sure what's causing it, but seeing how many bugs EQ has, I'd have to
say it's one of the patches causing it...  or the new Direct X??
