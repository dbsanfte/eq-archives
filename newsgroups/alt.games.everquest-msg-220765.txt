You seem to be having trouble understanding that the "they" you are
referring to are not the same people, not the same developer, not the
same assumptions, not the same attitude. Two separate inhouse
developers, same publisher, but the publisher is controlling the purse
strings, not the game design. They might as well be different
companies, other than sharing some code, like EQ does now (and we have
no idea if they are doing that). And even if they were linked, why one
would believe they would not take what they have learned from both EQ
and SWG and apply what they feel is the good parts of both (in their
opinion) is not apparent.

They aren't the same as the original EQ team either, for that matter,
though there may be some overlap there.
