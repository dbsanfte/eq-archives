I would assume from your comment below about KEI making the game "easy" you
have not played a shammy who seem to have a fantastically inbuilt ability to
OOM with KEI quite easily, particularly in a heavy brawl.

Secondly, I would also assume that anytime anyone buffs you, you instantly
click it off - surely that would make the game too "easy"???
