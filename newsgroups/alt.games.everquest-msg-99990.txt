When I made my woodie ranger it was my very first experience in any kind of
online RPG.  If I had done more research, I would have maxed out the
strength.  I too have very low strength.  Not to worry, you will get better
items.  I currently have a wolf fang earring and an orc fang earring, both
give str.  Some of the ivy armor gives str too.  You just have to keep in
mind that weight makes a difference and get used to seeing 'You are
encumbered'.  When you hit 30 you get a spell to buff up your str, so don't
worry about it too much.
Make sure you have a tailored quiver instead of a storebought one.  Also
look into some of the weight reducing packs, you can make 10slot backpacks
from HQ bear or HQ rockhopper hides.  Hopper hides are found in shadeweaver
thicket on luclin, you can sneak past the fiends but you gotta go behind the
ones in the halls until you get higher level, very narrow way but it's
possible to get past without aggroing them.

Good luck
