Well, replacing it with banded wouldn't make a lot of sense, but getting
banded instead of newbie quest armor isn't necessarily silly; getting
together enough cash to buy a full set (every slot) at 1pp per AC (and I
bet you can get it cheaper nowadays) would run what 70PP?  How long does
it take an even slightly interested newbie to make that much cash by
collecting spiderling silks or bone chips while leveling up?   A lot less
time wasted on the project than most race/class combinations will blow
getting their newbie armor quests done, thats how much!

If you are planning to go into smithing, then making your own set of
banded is its own reward, too.

Of course in either case you can probably buy better for not much more
money in the bazaar, being sold at land auction rates by higher levels
trying to cash in on stuff dropped by exp mobs or replacing their old
gear...

Splendid
14 gnomage proudly wearing a full set of Collective Initiate armor...
with cash in hand to buy gear three times as good!
