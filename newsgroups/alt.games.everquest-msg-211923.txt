That's because if a Paladin is gonna hold agro in a challenging
situation he has to limit himself to casting cheap stuns (and
maybe the occasional group heal, depending).  A Paladin's other
spells, while many of them are neat toys, are of very limited
value when agro must be held or casters must be interrupted.  In
fact, I'd say their value is (mostly) negative as they consume
mana that is then unavailable for stuns.  I've seen a lot of
Paladins who simply did not have a decent tactical understanding
of their abilities (and chain-stunning is just one tactic, I am
not claiming it is the only appropriate use of mana, just that
when it is necessary it's unwise to spend mana on other stuff).
