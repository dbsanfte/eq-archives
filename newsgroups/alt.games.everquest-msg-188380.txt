If I run both of my EQ accounts simultaneously it's usually on the one
machine (or on two machine in two rooms), but I also use a 4 machine
switch for other purposes.  I can't imagine circumstances where the
switch would be incompatible with EQ, but you do need to be careful if
you use the keyboard to switch rather than pressing the buttons on the
switch.  The combo for mine is 
<ctrl><alt><shift> # enter
where # is the number of the PC to switch to.  Sounds like a handful,
but it actually works very well once you get the hang of it.  The
<ctrl><alt><shift> are hit together, then the number, then enter.

The drawback of this is that if the switch doesn't take the keyboard
sequence for some reason, it's usually the <ctrl><alt><shift> bit that
it misses.  That means that you've just hit 1, 2, 3 or 4 in
circumstances where you might not want to... so, for example, if you
have 1 set up to auto-attack, you'd better be careful about anything
you have targeted when you switch PCs.  For that reason, I always set
up 1 and 2 to be buffs rather than detrimental spells/songs, just in
case.  (1 and 2 are work machines, 3 is the EQ machine, and 4 is only
ever used when I've just built a machine and need to test it.  Your
environment will be different.)

Amen to that.  Anyone that goes the KVM route should budget for some
quality monitor cables.  Don't bother with the cheap cables unless you
can get the supplier to agree to take them back if they don't work out
- the chances of them being ghost-free are slim.
