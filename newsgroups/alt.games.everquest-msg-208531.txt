Solo giants in the Dreadlands, you can go from 40-46 or so on these (then move
to giants in the burning woods).

A great spot is west of the giant hut on the south wall, right where the grass
and ice meet.  If you sit up on the ice a bit to the west, no creatures will be
near you, you can pull single giants and kite in a triangle in the big open ice
area that is flat with no fear of other creatures.  You can med near the south
wall there very safely.  Dont take on the Patriarches until you get to 44.  You
can quad kite the giants (except the patriarches of course) when you get KIE at
45 with full mana use....
