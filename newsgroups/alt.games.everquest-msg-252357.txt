Heh, I knew better than to buy CoH to begin with.  It was surprising that I
enjoyed it as long as I did, and if the traveling grind was changed I might
still, at least for a time.

I don't expect any sweeping changes in the travel routine, though.  What
they'd have to do to get me interested again would pretty much negate all
their "advanced" traveling skills, and that most likely wouldn't happen.

It's just hard for me to see large numbers of people maintaining an interest
in CoH for an extended period.  There's nothing really wrong with the game,
and it's quite good for what it is, but it's kinda like trying to live on
cotton candy.
