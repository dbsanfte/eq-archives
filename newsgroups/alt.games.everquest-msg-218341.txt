Hmmn - actually my comment that you originally replied to said:

"Yes,  I have complete and utter control over <whether or not I
pass on> my genetics to a new generation or not."

I never stated or implied that I have control over which genes I pass on and
which genes I do not. That is just another case of you not reading properly.
