I really wish you could do this without insults, Ben.

I gave you an example, and you couldn't respond to it.  Your best response
was to call me an idiot and then go off on a explanation that was long on
pollyanna worldviews, but decidedly short on specifics.

When you mention consequences for doing that sort of thing, you offer no
practical suggestions, nor do you seem to be able to answer my core
question, which has always been how does one distinguish between behavior
that is out of bounds from acceptable behavior.  You are, after all,
discussing when it's appropriate to kill another player in a video game.  It
shouldn't be that difficult.

Oh, and to highlight one particular thing:

"This enables a system where PvP is only done when it is worth it"

This is where you fall down, Ben.  This is the subjective view that you
think is objective.  This is my entire point.  This was why I asked for an
easily applicable definition of "random ganking" that no one has been able
to provide.

Not everyone's view of when PvP is "worth it" is the same, and that's
exactly why you have people hanging around the gates ganking newbies, and to
think that you can get those people in line without an absurdly complex
ruleset that would have loopholes to exploit anyway (or overly restrict PvP,
take your pick) IS a pollyanna worldview.

There will always be assholes playing your game, Ben.  You yourself are
proof of this axiom.

Keep banging your head, dude.
