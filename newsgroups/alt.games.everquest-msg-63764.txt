The stien is actually a pretty decent hand held item for any int based caster,
other players will buy them.  The quest, as you have seen, is somewhat
tedious, and not easily done by anyone but an enchanter... yes, I've done
it as a bard, a rogue, and a druid, and figure that really anyone with a druid
high level druid friend could do it if willing to put the time and effort in... but
a DE chanter can do it at level 8, while the bard and rogue need 15 and
someone capable of killing a spawn in the 30s, while the druid needs what,
level 24 for wolf form, and anyone else needs a level 44 druid friend to
wolf form them?

I think 250-400 pp is a tag left over from the early days of the game,
when few people had any idea how to do this quest, clearly based
on its stats the item is -worth- that much... but when people figured
out the quest and started doing it seriously for the money (with a
port level druid you can do it twice in 20 minutes... or six times in
25 minutes with a team dedicated to the job) the market flooded
with them.  On Morel Thule the price was driven as low as 50pp
before people just gave up on the quest as not being worth the
time and effort... and the fish drops got nerfed a bit so it wasn't
so easy to do in rapid succession.  Prices seem to have stabilized
in the 100 to 150 range, where there is enough demand to keep
a few people still doing the quest, and of course the leftover stiens
that eventually (at high levels) get replaced by better hand held
items trickle back down into the economy.
