If you're really hurting for CHA, you might consider the KCD, but all 
things being equal, I'd go with the Tempest. The difference you might see 
from an additional 8 CHA wouldn't be as much as you might notice from the 
extra INT and STA. Plus, extra damage on nukes, even infrequent ones, is 
always nice.
