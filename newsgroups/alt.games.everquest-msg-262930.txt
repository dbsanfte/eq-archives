I almost never see LFP used. When i did it was by someone who had forgotten
to turn it off after their party was ready. I use the lfg tool all the time,
even when i'm not playing, to get a feel for the numbers at certain levels
on my server. For example, my 44 shm has no-one advertising via lfg or lfp
in his level range. :P
