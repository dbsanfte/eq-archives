Well, in my early tailoring days i think i managed to sell 2 pieces of raw silk,
for 1pp each.

Ahh, love the persons that think their worthless trades are great and wanna trade
them. Got offered 20pp, 2 rusty long swords, a couple of bat and wasï¿½ wings and a
lumberjack cap for a FierDal boot once.
Of the guys that think a Plz will automatically lower the price with 80%. Some
guy kept bugging me to sell FierDal boots to him for 50pp (cost 58pp and 4
forages a try to make, got 2 boots on the last 12 combines), untill i put him on
my ignore list.
