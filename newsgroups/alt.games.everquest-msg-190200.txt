Upgrade your weapons first.

I would suggest replacing the GBS with a new primary, then moving the
CSS to secondary.  Of course wurmy is perfect for you, at a cost of
somewhere around 1k, depending on servers and luck.  (but no you cant
quest it)  That GBS is a huge liability whenever you get high enough
level for it to start procing.  On top of the large number of buffs
that rangers cast on themselves, your cleric friend will be casting
some important spells as well.  Debuffing them, constantly, would be a
mistake.

Rangers have poor choices for armor.  Therefor, anytime a piece or
armor shows up with relatively good stats--that a ranger can wear--it
is going to be *very* expensive because it is rare and highly
sought-after.  Meanwhile, rangers get to swing most of the same
weapons as other melee classes (and some that others dont).  These
weapons are very common and cheap.  Best to get your DPS up first,
then worry about armor.  There is pretty much nothing you can do,
quest-wise, to upgrade what you have though.

As for armor, if you decide not to go after ivy, look for some ry'gor
stuff for legs and a few other spots.  (You may be able to farm them
in velious soon anyway...they drop off orcs there)  Look for a
treeweave for your chest slot.  Look for an upgrade to your golden
fire wedding ring, (velium fire if you can afford), and do the same
for the other hand.  That char and wisdom on your mask are worthless
(my 56 ranger has around 90 wisdom).  Get an acrylia reinforced
instead of studded.  Once again, you can't quest for much other than
ivy...but to get the most bang for your time and money, questing is
just not worth it.

Keep the bow for now.  Keep the bracers for now.  Keep the earrings.

As for stats...

AC is going to be important for you, as is stamina for HP.  Your order
of stats seems about right, but don't forget strength (the easiest
stat to increase).  Strength, I believe and despite what some will
say, does help damage output.  Meanwhile, if you are looking to loot
much and also carry around some weapons to switch in and out, strength
has an obvious benefit...

Still, I just wouldn't worry about those stats too much right now. 
They don't matter that much as far as helping you level up, and by the
time they do matter, you will be replacing all your stuff anyway.
