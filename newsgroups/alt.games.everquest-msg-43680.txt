Yeah, I think I have a pretty good idea of how the mobs work at higher
levels.  I know that a single level 60 warrior can hold aggro on
temple defenders in ToV all day long, even with defensive up.  Of
course that requires that the puller clear aggro (monk/sk/necro
feign), the warrior engage first and build up aggro, then have
everyone else join in.  If the warrior dies, then it becomes a problem
getting the secondary warrior to generate enough aggro, but that's why
the game is interesting.

I'm sorry, I just think that people who know how to play their class
well learn aggro control.  Hell, I only got hit 3 times in 3 hours
last night in ToV as a bard, singing like mad right under the belly of
the bastards, and once because I was the last one alive.  (Yeah, we
fucked up and pulled while clerics were LOM and other folks were
engaged in CoH.)

What I'm saying here is that in a non-raid situation, if you have a
problem with your monk drawing aggro, the mobs don't hit for enough to
kill him in a round or two.  Even Juggs in Seb aren't going to kill a
monk that quickly.  If the warrior loses aggro, and the monk is
getting smacked around, he can feign, which means he's not doing
damage for a couple seconds.  The warrior is still doing damage, and
taunting, the rest of the party is doing the same damage they were
doing before, and as soon as the monk stands back up, he's doing
damage again.  Even if a monk does 3000hp/minute damage, he's going to
not do 300hp in the time it takes to feign and get back up, not a huge
loss.  
Think this through, and lets simplify.  You have exp mobs and raid
mobs.  Exp mobs are often done with a monk as your main tank, maybe
not in your world, but I've done it enough to know that it works
pretty damn well, especially with a shammy/enchanter slowing.  If a
monk is the main tank anyway, extra damage is just gravy.  If the monk
isn't the main tank, and you're on exp mobs, I don't think a warrior
would be using defensive, rather would have two fast 1h weapons, and
would be hitting the taunt button as fast as possible.  So the monk
does a bit more damage, it's still not that big a difference IF the MA
gets aggro correctly to start.  If it's a raid mob, you only want the
MA getting hit, and you should know how to achieve that.  If a 60
warrior can now hold aggro with 10 other melees hitting for all their
worth, and 10 casters blasting, I don't think that an extra 10% damage
by a single melee is going to throw things out of whack.
