No argument there.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't one of a cleric's main concerns the
health of party members? When staring at the book, you were still able
to see your group mate's health, right? And you were also able to see
the chat box, and even communicate using it, right?

Don't get me wrong - I'm pleased to see the book going away, and I
think it's one of the very good changes coming up. But in my
experience, staring at the book never really was all that limiting as
far as my awareness of what was going on around me.

I've played a cleric, enchanter, wizard and druid, and only one of
those did I play past level 35, and with none of them did I ever
consider the book limiting as far as my personal performance. Like you
say, it's boring, but it never affected how well I played my
character.
