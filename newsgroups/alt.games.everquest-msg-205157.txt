First, memorize your spells if you have any. (say if you dont know how this
is done)
Hit "i" for inventory and place your weapon in your primary weapon slot.
Dind the newbie area near your home city and find a monster that cons white
or blue (say if you dont know how to con things) Consult www.eqatlas.com if
you cant find your way around (or bring up the online map)
Left click on the monster to "target" it. Press "a" to auto attack, and if
youre close enough your character will start trying to hit the monster.
Once the mob is dead, you will get some experience, and you can loot the
corpse by right clicking on it.
Save up bone chips, spider(ling) silks for sale to other players in the
bazaar.

Id recommend starting a druid wood elf or hafling for first character. They
arnt the most wonderful class at high levels, but they are easy to play and
easy to solo, so great for getting the hang of EQ.
