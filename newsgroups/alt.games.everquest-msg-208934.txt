    Let me be a bit more specific, then. As you'll see, there's a reason why
I didn't get into it. ;-)

    The observations of others have given us the following data:

(1) Prices vary with CHA, up to a CHA hard cap and down to a minimum CHA
hard cap.
(2) Prices vary with faction, up to a faction hard cap and down to a minimum
faction hard cap.
(3) The variance of item price changes from item to item.
(4) The product of the vendor sale price of an item and the offered vendor
buy price is constant for a given item, at a given level of CHA and faction,
on a vendor with only one of that item for sale.

    That last part is crucial, because it suggests an actual formula for the
price of an item:

    Vendor sale price = P x M(cha,fac)
    Vendor purchase from player price = P x [1/M(cha,fac)]

    Where P is the absolute price of an item and M(cha, fac) is some
function, greater than or equal to 1, of CHA and faction. Let's define
N(cha, fac) = M(cha, fac) - 1 and we can write our formulas as

    VSP = P x [1 + N(cha, fac)]
    VPFPP = P x {1/[1 + N(cha, fac)]}

    with N always greater than or equal to zero. Now we come to our
assumption: since N is a computer function, which varies from item to item,
it makes sense that it varies as follows:

    VSP = P x [1 + C x N(cha, fac)]

    where C is a defined quantity greater than or equal to zero for each
item in the database. That is to say, the function of cha and faction
doesn't change from item to item, but rather the constant multiplying that
quantity. Items with large differences in VSP and VPFPP are items with large
values of C.

    Now, to create a "tradeable cash item", make an item with C = 0.

    Then, VSP = P x [1 + 0 x N(cha, fac)] = P
    and    VPFPP = P x {1/[1 + 0 x N(cha, fac)]} = P.

    That's me skipping to the end of solving P x [1 + C x N] = P x {1/[1 + C
x N]}, for P>0 and constant, C >= 0, and N>=0 and constant.
