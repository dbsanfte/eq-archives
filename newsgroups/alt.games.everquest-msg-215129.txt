    What on God's green earth have you been smoking this time, Hughes? Let's
pick this shit apart one turd at a time.

    (a) Monks have a better table, period. 5% more damage base is nothing to
sneeze at - people pay thousands of plat to upgrade FBSS's to RBG's to get
less total percentage improvement.
    (b) Special attacks do contribute more DPS. Just using Flying Kick, and
not any of the special AA's available, is a good DPS boost over a warrior's
Bash/Kick.
    (c) The monk's low-level skill caps are much larger than those of a
warrior. A warrior caps Double Attack at 200 until level 51; a monk caps at
210. A warrior caps Offense at 200 until level 51; a monk caps at 230, and
gets 5 point boosts at levels 15 and 30 (so they are ahead of the WAR from
15 on). Warrior weapon skills are capped at 200 until level 51; the monk
pre-50 cap on 1HB is 240, on 2HB is 240, and on HTH is 225. The dual wield
cap for a warrior is 200 until level 51; a monk caps at 252 before they hit
51. Net result: a monk double attacks more from 40 until 60, has more ATK
from Offense from level 15 until 60, has more ATK from specific weapon skill
from level 40 until 60, and dual wields better from level ONE (the warrior
doesn't even get dual wield until his teens) until level 60. That seems a
bit longer than "briefly", doesn't it?

    As for the other crud you've listed in your previous post:

    Saying the warrior equipment set is comparable to monk gear is
laughable. Your upper-level monk is going to have a 16/22 weapon with a
normal proc that cost him 10 K mainhand and a 14/20 weapon that cost him
under 10 K offhand. The warrior will have a 13/20 weapon with an infrequent
proc mainhand (which cost him an arm and a leg to buy), and whatever he can
afford after that offhand, like a 12/19 with a normal proc (which is still
above 10 K). It should tell you something that the current hot item amongst
warriors, that mainhand Copper Hammer of Striking, can also be used by monks
but they don't because IT SUCKS COMPARED WITH WHAT ELSE THEY CAN GET. What
will our twinks have at lower levels, when recommended levels make all those
listed weapons suck? Well, our wee monk has a cheap 17/28 and a 12/23,
either with stats (Z's Katar) or free which he got in Maiden's Eye with ease
(run out, feign until your club drops). Our warrior doesn't have the free
12/23, as it's PRI only and he wants to use his massive 25/40 Wurmslayer
there. Offhand he has a 14/27 slasher. At lowest levels, the monk is better
because of the overall damage caps. When those caps come off, they're pretty
equal until the damage bonus kicks in as the monk weapons are faster. Oh,
and the monk really starts to pull away when his 12/23 starts to proc at
level 40 (both his weapons have procs, neither of the warrior weapons do).

    Do they use two handers, instead? You don't even want to get into that.
TStaff is going to destroy an Imbued Fighter's Staff or that 36/40 Blackened
2HS from Acrylia in a head-to-head comparison, and the warrior isn't going
to keep pace with a Staff of Flowing Water with his Windblade at higher
levels. Again, advantage monk.

    You were right about a warrior being able to solo more mobs, but not in
the way you thought. A warrior can kill a bigger, nastier mob than a monk
can solo, especially with a damage shield potion to help out. But soloing
rate is about recovering from HP loss, and the monk owns the warrior when it
comes to that. The monk has a higher Bind Wounds cap pre-51, and also has
Mend. I can't emphasize enough how crucial Mend is to solo speed for a monk.
Monks are also better equipped to handle some sort of incident, like
training, an overpull, or adds - Feign Death. If my monk gets some hostile
add in Dawnshroud, for example, he runs over to the level 60 NPCs, Feigns
beside them, and the hostile mobs attack the NPCs and are snuffed. Problem
solved, I stand up and continue to beat on the target. If a warrior had the
same problem, they're looking at a run to zone, a dicey fight, or a CR. No
amount of feeble utility (and beyond the Truncheon, Wavecrasher, and Silken
Whip/Kunzar Ku'Whatever/etc., warriors have nothing) is going to make up for
that. Heck, a monk with Adamantine Club and Baton of Royal Stature will
likely save himself more damage than the Wavecrasher warrior, and a monk
with a TStaff can have fights where he isn't even attacked!
