Since the last patch, when I sit down to med, my lag meter jumps up to
around 80 to 90%. But the second I stand back up from medding, the meter
slowly goes back to normal. Any suggestions? I have tried this on two
different ISP's, so I dont think it is my actual connection, but more with
something to do within the game mechanics.

Unfortunately, it got me killed last night in Blackburrow. A train was on me
and almost had me killed, before I even stood up.

If you've heard of this happening, I would appreciate any advice. I already
have something sent to Verant as well.
