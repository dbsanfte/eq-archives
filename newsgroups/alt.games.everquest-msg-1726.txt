Well, first you figure out your average hit with that weapon
Av. hit = 2*<weapon base damage> + (<your level> - 23)/3
So, if my monk is 51, and is using a 14/31 weapon in his primary hand, 
it would be 2*14 + (51-23)/3 = 37 So usually I hit for 37
Then you divide it by delay of the weapon. Delay of 31 (like in my case) 
means that I swing the weapon once every 3.1 seconds. So damage per 
second on it is 11.9
This only works for primary hand one handed weapons.
For off-hand weapons you don't get a damage bonus (the part with (<your 
level> - 23)/3). For the two handed weapons your bonus is (<your level> 
- 23)/2

There you go. Now that I've confused myself as well, I can go home proud
