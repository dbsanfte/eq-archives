I think the poison/diseases are worse than the curses because they can kill
you quick.  The curses just seem to disable you.  Always have your best
poison and disease cures memorized before touching a box.  Otoh cure curse
is a rarer spell than the poison/disease line so if you don't have that in
your party you will have a failed mission and stuck (1 strength =
immobilized) waiting for it to fade.  Only alternative is suicide I think.
The third whammy is drunk which can be fun, but dangerous to fight.  Not
sure if it stops spellcasting.  It doesnt in pok so it might not in ldon.
