I have watched people go LD in combat and just stand there and die, no
casting or anything to defend. Hard to pull the agro off em too for
some reason. Wish there was something we could do protect ourselves
but in truth there isnt.
This brings up the interesting point, if the game knows you are LD why
are you left there to die? Verant has always maintained the problem
was in DETECTING your LD status. Sometimes I think they dont even know
whats going on.
