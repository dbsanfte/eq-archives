Not "Will Trade", "Trade Only".  That is, pp offers need not apply.
Dates to early in the game when there were no useful pp sinks.

Oh, and BTW, my earlier replies to this thread that mentioned "Hate"
were obviously victimized by a gremlin who changed "Sky" to "Hate".
The very first time I saw some of the old "trade only" loot offerred
for pp was less than a week after that Plane opened, until then there
was quite literally no value to having more than a couple thousand pp,
there was nothing useful to do with it.
