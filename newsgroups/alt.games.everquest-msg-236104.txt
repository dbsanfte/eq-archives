Go ahead, retire now.  The sad thing is, regardless of how much or when you
play, you are paying a monthly fee to play when you want.  It's not ok that
these inconveniences occur.  However, I suppose if it was better service,
the monthly fee would go up anyway.  It's about 'time' for most of us, not
money.
