No, this is pretty hard to explain if you haven't seen the Dye set up for
locations.
You are correct in how armour Dying works tho, it is armour slots that get
dyed and not the individual pieces.

When you go to Inventory you will see a button the says Dye. When you press
this you get a window with with two rows of small boxes, one row is for
Tints and the other for Dyes. Each visible armour slot has a Tint and Dye
box, the Tint is the colour of the armour in that slot already, so Cobalt
will have a blue box, Tolan's Brown, ES green etc. The other row for Dyes
will all be white, for no colour, until you add colour dye to it.
Ok, my problem is the Tint box for my chest should be black (same as it is
for my legs) but after hitting the reset button to clear my proposed dyes
(you can mess around with colours to get the right one before actually
saving it) it wiped the Tint from the box and also from the actual BP...So I
hadn't actually applied any dyes but I had turned my Breast Plate of living
shadow, silver. I can, of course do this to the legs by applying a pure
white, RGB all 255, dye to it but the tint will still show as black for that
slot.

I think the problem is just a minor bug and can be fixed by me swapping my
BP to another (coloured)one and then back, so as to give that slot a Tint
colour agian, I just haven't tried this. I just thought it would be funny if
I had actually removed the colour Tint from the actual breast plate itself
so it is now Silver and not black, no matter who is wearing it, I'll find
out later tonight.
