}OK, now you are an idiot.  There are well over a 1000 servers just for

}Hell, what you're thinking of != hacking.

Sure it is.  You've just demonstrated that it's a lot of power, and 
therefore a fairly thick cable, too thick for dikes.  So obviously, our 
postulated psycho would have to hack through it, wouldn't he? :)

And hacking, by the way, has long been used to refer to any clever or 
unexpected way to solve a problem.  Conducting a DOS attack on Verant by 
way of cutting their power would be pretty unexpected.  Not particularly 
clever or subtle, but there you go.
