Here's the way SOE explained it on their message boards.  (Actually, I think 
it was more that another individual posted what they understood to be the 
case and one of the SOE folks said yep that's it).

When someone in a party dies, their experience dept is divided in to two. 
One half of that experience debt becomes the group experience debt and is 
evenly shared out among all of the party members,  The other half of that 
experience debt becomes the "shard recovery debt" that you mentioned, 
belongs to the player only, and is recovered in full when they get their 
shard back.

The total experience debt is the same overall as the player would get if 
they had died solo, as is the reduction of the debt from recovering their 
shard.  What would normally remain to a solo player AFTER recovering their 
shard is instead evenly distributed to all party members.

Since I'm not in beta (yet) I have only what I've read to go on, so someone 
can correct me if I'm wrong.  But that's the way I understand it.
