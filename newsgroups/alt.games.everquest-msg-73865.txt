I like how he bitches that "EQ can't keep up with DAoC".  True they gave us
a graphics engine overhaul, but as far as "keeping up" with the next
generation of MUD's, I seem to remember a few months back when Brad
McQuaid's personal system got hacked into, they made remarks of how it
contained an early build of Everquest 2.  Since SoL was already in the works
I'm sure this EQ2 is a different animal altogether and I'm sure it will kick
DAoC and all others out of the ball field.

*Unless*  EQ2 becomes to EQ what Diablo2 was to Diablo.  BOOOORING!
