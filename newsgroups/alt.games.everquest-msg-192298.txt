AA xp = same as going from 51 > 52 no matter what your level is really. So
at 51 should move the same, at 52 a little faster, etc.
As for a shaman and AA, I got run3 at 51 and now am pushing on to 59 before
I get more. I am level 57.99 so should be starting AA soon. I figured levels
+ spells > AA for now.
Most people say getting AA at level 59 or 60 since most things green at 61
that could be useful to litterally tear through at 59 & 60.
