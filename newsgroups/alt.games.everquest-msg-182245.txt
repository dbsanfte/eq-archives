This morning I tried to log into Everquest and was told my account had
expired, which surprised me as it was automatically deducted every 3
months, and my game card had also expired. Anyway I decided to re-bill
my account. Problem is I'm not sure what they mean by the game card
number they ask for, or what the game card is for that matter.
I did try to restart my account via http://everquest.station.sony.com/
but all my attempts lead to a screen saying there store is currently off
line 'Sorry for any inconvenience' :p~~. So as it stands, I'm
effectively locked out of Everquest. What should I do?
Thank you for your time.

Cheers Watchman :)
