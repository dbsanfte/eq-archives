Most of the circle spells are found in Toxx at the druid circle.  The 
new luclin circles and rings are in Rivervale, just look for the little 
dude surrounded by druids, not hard to pick out. Ring of GD is in the 
ranger guild in kelethin I've heard, and Ring of IC can get from certain 
gypsies, I'm going to the ones in NK.

They make druids go all over to pick up all the spells for each level.

Next time, check castersrealm for the info.
