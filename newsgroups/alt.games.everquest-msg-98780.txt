Yes, they're global, and they have a *ton* of uses.  For example,
create a channel, invite all your friends to join, and then tell them
to type in /autojoin <channelname>:<channelpassword> and they will
*automatically* join that channel whenever they log on with any of
their characters, whether grouped or not or in a different guild than
you or whatever.

No more having to communicate via /tells when someone goes linkdead
and then gets back or switches characters and then having to tell
everyone else what they said.

Very nice addition.
