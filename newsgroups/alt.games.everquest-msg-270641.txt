Basically WoW is more for the newcomer, a simpler game, more solo
oriented.
EQ2 is for the old style MMORPG player.  Complex (less so than EQ1 but
still complex), difficult at times, and pretty much requires you to
group.  You can solo in EQ2, but for the most part you will need to be
in a group.
I see them as almost opposite games.  Either you like one or the other,
it's just a matter of styles.
My style, I still think City of Heroes is the best MMORPG out there :)
