I tried to set up the emulator back in '05, was too much of a PITA for 
me, I'd rather pay a monthly fee than work that hard.  As I recall, 
though, there were other things that attracted me to the idea; it wasn't 
really the EQ world, just using the EQ system, perhaps?  Quite a ways 
back, and since I didn't get it working, I never really understood what 
was going on.

The EULA is honored as much in the breech as in the observation, I 
think.  And SOE's level of customer service (at least for the last 
couple years before I quit) wasn't something that would warrant the 
respect needed to prevent people from violating it if they felt like it.
