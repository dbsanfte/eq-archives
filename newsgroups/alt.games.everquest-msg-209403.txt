I'm a good healer, I don't need convincing of that fact. I've kept 
groups alive in BoT and HoH for hours on end; but that Druids are good 
healers does not mean that they are sought after in groups. At the end 
of the day, a Cleric brings in also better Melee buffs and, of course, 
rezzes if things go south.

Conventional wisdom has it that Druids make better healers than clerics 
precisely because they don't have the luxury of resurrecting the people 
they allow to die. :)
