Oh, so I'm being a jerk, since I choose not to swear when others do so?
Good to know that sticking to my beliefs is considered to be a bad thing.
Why is it that "expressing yourself" is only good when it's done in a
colorful manner.  Can I not express myself in a restrained fashion?

Don't be so sure.  I'm a sailor, and I still take offense to using the
Lord's name in vain.

Yeah, I hate those who have trained themselves to show restraint, too.  I
mean, what, do they think they're better than us, just because they've
learned to control themselves?  Jeepers!

Similar to the Supreme Court standing on obscenity:  "I can't define it, but
I know it when I see it."

And make sure you use the obligatory profanity when it's necessary.  Tunare
forbid that you should choose not to use it.
