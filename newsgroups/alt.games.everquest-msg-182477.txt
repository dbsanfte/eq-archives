Ok, now to make myself a parriah around here.  You know, unless you can go
one-on-one against Zek, you really have no right to complain about the
numbers used to kill him.  Even one group is still an unfair advantage.
It's not your characters' skills, or even those of the players that allow
you to take him down, it's your numbers.  Now, your skills allow you to
minimize the numbers, but the situation remains, after the second person
joins in, it's all a matter or where you draw the line.  That's why I hate
when you see guilds like Triton post "Yeah, Tunare was an easy bitch."  Ok,
let's see any one of the guild members take her on without his friends.

Yes, but all of them got zerged to an extent.  Not in the "no skill, even
the clerics are meleeing" definition, but that really wasn't what y'all were
talking about with the "lone guild" rule.
