    The AC bonus is roughly one AC per level, IIRC. That's what it's been on
my Iksar monk through level 40, above and beyond the monk AC bonus. At the
mid levels, for an Iksar monk this advantage is massive over a human.
There's very little plate (Symbols of Loyalty to Vox) that monks wear. For
the warriors, at mid levels the difference between a Crafted warrior and a
Trooper Scale Iksar warrior in terms of AC are very small. Most of the
difference is actually due to not being able to wear Fine Steel Plate in the
hidden slots, and there's a slew of non-plate alternatives with very close
AC.

    For the shaman, it IS an issue due to the low price of Jaundiced Bone
arms, helms, boots, and gloves. My level 24 troll shaman is well over 600
AC, and closing in on 650 AC, from cheap items - no Iksar could match that
at low level in Scaled Mystic gear. It's also an issue at high levels, with
the JBB being unusable by the Iksar. It can also be an issue for the
necromancers - although they can get a fairly strong AC (comparable to a
human or Erudite in Flayed), they can't use some of the more common INT
enhancers like GCBs or GEBs. For the necros, though, regen makes up for ANY
gear they can't use. If trolls didn't exist it would be just as strong a
point for the shamans.
