... work for your money? ...
I mean.. I'm not complaining.. even though I have some crappy equipment
because I know I can't afford better..
but work for you money? does that mean.. sitting 3 days 8 hours to wait for
a spawn and then sell it?

I don't have that much time.. can afford a few hours now and then.. but
surely not 3 full days in a row. Is this what I can expect when I reach a
higher level? .. I think I'll abandon my character by that time and start a
new one..
