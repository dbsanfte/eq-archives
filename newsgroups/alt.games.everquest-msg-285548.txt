Well that was only moderately successful, I ended up having to get the 
eq installer itself off a disc, and then ended up doing substantial 
downloading after all.

Then, once the patch was over, I hit play and.... drop to desktop. 
Repeatedly.

Checking, I discover the damn things are running DirectX 8.1!

So now I'm downloading and installing DirectX9.0C, and we'll see.  This 
is an exercise in patience.
