I bound my left & right arrow keys to use sense heading and
/loc a couple of weeks ago w/o trouble.   I can also unmap
them - and re-map them - today.   That's with both expansion
packs enabled.   If it doesn't work for you, it's either included
in an expansion you don't have (SoV, probably) or you're doing
something wrong.
