Weapon skills, combat table, melees item haste (and in this case melee only
chanter haste), double attack....

Well maybe this isn't "conclusive" enough for you.. but last time we did
Sontalak, a warrior turned all hits on, and logged the damage to parse it.

He parsed at 7k damage... I parsed at 3k damage (I have primal, he doesn't),
2 60 rogues parsed at less then 2k and 4k, our guild leader (well geared
monk) parsed at less then 4k....

The *only* one that IMO parsed correctly was the warriors damage, all melees
would have used innerflame (duelist) disc, which for me and rogues is 4x
damage... I had 2 15/20 1hb's and max haste, the rogues had a mix of nToV
and Primal (and one has chaotic backstab even if he couldn't get behind to
BS)

At the same time, that meleeing magician could be medding for 1 more nuke,
to deliver a LOT more damage then he could ever do with melee.  Heck the
same goes for a cleric nuke (now they can nuke for what, 1100dmg a pop)
