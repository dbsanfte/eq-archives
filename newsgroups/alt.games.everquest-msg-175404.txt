I think its going to be a lot of fun, with the space expansion they are
proposing, it seems like this was pretty well though out.  I personally am
glad there will be a small number of Jedi, it will make
seeing/encountering one that much cooler.  Kinda like seeing someone in
full bronze back in the day :)

My goal is to make a Dark Jedi Wookie, somehow, I will do it. :)
