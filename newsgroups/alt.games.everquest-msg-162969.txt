My dog once sold his account, back so far that the statute of limitations has
long since run out.

He swore he was quitting the game forever, going cold turkey.  He did not ship
anything at all when he sold it, just sent the name and account password; of
course the purchaser already had all the software and was buying a second
account with a level 49 cleric on it for his mynah bird to use dual boxing with
a program called EQDoors or something.

I tried to tell my dog what a risk he was running doing this, but he just
shrugged and explained that he also goes out without a leash from time to time,
and felt safe enough... and further pointed out that all the "punishments" that
the boys at Verant had lined up for cheaters like him consisted of banning the
account and so forth.  Since he wasn't planning on returning, this wouldn't
affect him, the person at real risk was the Mynah bird.

Of course 3 months later, the pooch came crawling back to the game, and now has
to live in fear of someone finding out what he once did and banning his new
level 63 character in a twisted form of vengeance.  Still doesn't worry about
going to the Pound for it though.
