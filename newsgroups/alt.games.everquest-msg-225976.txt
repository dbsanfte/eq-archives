I didn't think a single arrow would cause significant extra aggro while I
was pulling.  I wasn't using any spells at all except Snare at 30; the only
time I did anything otherwise was when the enchanter got a resist (in which
case it was Taunt - Tangling Weeds - Snare - Sit - If I don't have aggro yet
face the mob/Flamelick/Kick and deal with I'm tanking it now).  I suppose I
might have to find another belt when grouping; I have an FBSS for item haste
and everyone in the group had the same spell haste.

2hs was my final solution - but gads, I hate how slow that thing is compared
to my usual blenderlike swings!
