Well, I'm 46 now with a Nostrolo's Tambourine, so I can literally run
circles around folks with SoW.  I generally notice the buff icon,
unless I've been gifted with a whole slew of buffs, and then it may
take me a minute or two to notice.  Also, I don't check for an icon
when I start up Selos, and there is no difference between the SLoW
icon and the Selos icon.  Well, I guess the lack of 'your feet move
faster' spam, but I've got my text box hidden down at the bottom and
don't generally look at it while traveling.  
(As a data-point, I can walk with Selos at SoW speed.)
