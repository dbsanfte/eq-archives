Re-re-reading your post, it basically supports DT's reply.  I've played a
ranger up to 53 now, which doesn't make me the ultimate authority on the
subject, but does give me a bit of a grasp on the trials and tribulations
that a ranger goes through trying to get to lvl 55 (trueshot, when we really
start to out-damage our melee weapons with a bow) and eventually to 59 and a
bunch of AA (when our DPS is actually measurable against raid level
targets).  Yes, I have some trouble finding planes groups.  No, soloing
isn't even remotely difficult.  Take everything you just said about soloing
with an SK, add dual wield, take away mobs that aren't animals, and you have
ranger soloing.  I've practically (I have been in a few planes groups with
guildies since my late 40s) solo'd my ranger since about lvl 42 by fear
kiting animals (and plain old melee solo'd from 35-40, grouped in DL for
41-42).  It's a breeze.

That said, I've never had to wait long to find a group in DL.  And if I
really really want to group but can't find one (this really doesn't happen
often), I jump on my rogue or enchanter.
