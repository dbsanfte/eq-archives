There are a LOT of quests in EQ that work this way.  (Using the word
"work" advisedly. :-)  I.e., you're given very vague information and
have to resort to trying various key phrases on lots of characters to
see if they'll respond.  Or you're told you need a certain ingredient
but not told where to find it, maybe not even what zone it can be
found in.  (I find it particularly frustrating when it makes no sense
in the game world.  E.g., a character asks me to deliver an item to
so-and-so, but won't tell me where to find so-and-so.)

The idea, presumably, is to push players into making the world more
socially interactive by sharing information.  I.e., someone finds an
item and doesn't know what it's for, or gets a piece of information
and doesn't know what it means.  Elsewhere, someone is looking for
that item or information.  As players share their knowledge, the
pieces of the quest come together.  In theory, anyway.

So there are (more or less) three ways for you to find out what you
want.  One is to keep going around hailing NPCs (non-player characters)
looking for ones that say stuff related to Groo's topic, or asking NPCs
questions based on Groo's text.  (E.g., "What is a spiritual anchor?" or
something like that, I think.)  Another is to ask other players in the
game about it, but people probably get ticked off pretty quick if there
are too many questions being shouted around all the time; they expect
you to have done some research first.  And the third is the research:
check on the web to see what information other players have discovered
that might help you.  A great site for this is www.allakhazam.com.
Follow its link to Bestiary by Zone -> Shadeweaver's -> Groo, and you'll
find a link to a quest called Whisperlings, which is what he's talking
about.  In particular, if you hail the tailor, Tiamon Aroo, you'll get
the clue you need.

I'm still a bit torn by the need to look up answers this way.  In some
way it feels like cheating, but over time I've come to view it as a
way of asking other players within the game, without bugging them in
the game world.  The hard part from Sony's end of it is trying to keep
the quests interesting to do even when you don't have to figure them out
from scratch.

Oh, and be warned that sometimes the info on the web will tell you how
to do the quest but still leave you wondering how anyone figured it out
in the first place!
