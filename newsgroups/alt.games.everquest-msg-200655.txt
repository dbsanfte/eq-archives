Hi,

For the past three days EverQuest has thrown me off the server when the 
following happens;

I'm buying from a vendor and I attempt to buy something but instead of 
letting me buy the item it says (the item is still there - its a regular 
item from the vendor who never runs out) - "The item you have attempted 
to purchase has already been sold."

Has anyone else experienced this problem?

Matt
