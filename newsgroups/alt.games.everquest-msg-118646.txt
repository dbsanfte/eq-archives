I saw a couple of replies in the "Wuoshi Killed Me" thread about being able
to bind in Kael near the WL zone line.  It says in eqatlas's bind guild that
you can bind in Kael near the zone line to WL or EW.  Sunday, I tried to
bind my cleric there (who should be able to bind just about anywhere) and it
told me to find a city!  Stepped out of the zone and bound just fine in WL,
and when I was in Kael I couldn't have been more that three steps inside.  I
didn't try to bind my monk there, but I was wondering what was going on with
this.  Is there a level requirement to bind in this zone that I couldn't
find posted anywhere, or did something change recently?  Any info on this
would be appreciated.
