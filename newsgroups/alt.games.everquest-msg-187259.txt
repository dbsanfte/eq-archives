1. All druids are KOS to you
2. You stop helping anyone else (unasked), even if they're going to die,
because they are competition and people who make fatal mistakes are
inefficient placeholder killers
3. You make a button that tells everyone in /ooc what a placeholder is, what
the HG placeholders are and what killing them does
4. You stop being amazed at how many people don't know what a placeholder is
5. You wish sony would add a feature into the game allowing a KSee to PvP,
at their option, their KSer.
6. Upon returing to RM at the beginning of your session, you survey the
scene of carnage, noting the new, high number of player corpses scattered
around with satisfaction and a grim smile - Rathe is doing its vital job for
evolution. Even better, you recognise many of the corpses as KSer/idiots.
7. You start to think Guard Carnita is kind of attractive and wish you
weren't KOS to her so you could ask her out
8. You learn how to do everything while keeping a mostly full mana bar so
that when you get 2 HG adds for no good reason you can kite them too :)
9. You no longer take any notice of what coinage you're looting each time,
only how much plat and how many dots you have after each sell
10. Your dreams are haunted by images of hill giants.

Cheers,
James
