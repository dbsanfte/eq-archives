    They were taken out after the death of Lanys T'Vyl GM event. The quest
that was in game involving them was never fixed (various parts were broken
at one point or another), so nobody ever completed it before it was removed
from game. The faction hits are still in game last time I checked, though.
And close on the name - they were Primal Rage IIRC. Dismal Rage is a human
SK guild faction.
