If you have a 61 druid you should have no problem getting a few more kpp
very quickly to twink your pally. My 63 druid (65 now) spent all of 2 weeks
collecting gear for a frog pally for when LoY came out, to the tune of about
15-17kpp, without it being a serious drain on cash flow. A good 5-7 hour
session in PoV can bring 500-2kpp depending on how much of the "junk" loot
you get to keep. Not many people grouping on crystalline spiders, golems and
crawlers are interested in much other than Metallic Liquids and Crystal
Spider Eyes (?) which still sell for 5+kpp, so you can pick up the boulders
and pebble formations and sell them to vendors for between 25 and 200 pp.
Your real worries are going to come when you can't get into higher planes
for your level 63/64 Spectral Parchments and have to buy the scrolls for
5-30kpp (yes, I can get to them, but with 3-5 groups of people the
occasional rune/spec drop is not going to land in your lap often).
