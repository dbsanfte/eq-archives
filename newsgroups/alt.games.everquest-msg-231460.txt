One of my first awe effects was in Butcherblock outside the Dwarven
City.  The giant dwarf statue over the city entrance.

The entrance to Veksar is very impressive (inside of Veksar in the big
body of water with the stream of water falling from the celing)

Many of the Kunark zones just impress me with the ruined architecture
and statues...  Swamp of No Hope, Field of Bone, Lake of Ill Omen.  I
have always thought they stuck well with the theme.

Seeing my first dragon in Permafrost (belive that's vox, I always get
naggy and vox mixed up).

Base Jumping from:
Ice Bridge in Eastern wastes...   
Pit in Blackburrow.
Hole in Paineel ( do with a lowbie, CR from drop a nasty run)

Oh speaking of paineel... the water pit where the doorway to the Hole
is, is quite pretty.

Most of the LoY expansion has impressed me with theme consistancy, and
well just the cool look.
