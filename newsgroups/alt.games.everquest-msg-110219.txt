At some point, you've got to make a call of judgement. The American Civil 
War was fought on the pretense of superior morality (whatever the *real* 
political and socio-economic reasons were). If news of the Holocaust had 
spread out *before* the war, WWII may have been fought on a moral basis 
too. I see nothing wrong with crushing Al Qaeda on the basis that they 
are evil, while being aware that, to themselves, they are all great, 
paradise-bound holy warriors... In fact, that knowledge falls squarely 
into the "useful intelligence" category.
