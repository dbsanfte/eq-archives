Actually, that's probably a bad idea because scammers could pick it up here
and steal your account.  Instead I would recommend that you email it to me
(I'm a very trustworthy guy, I won't release your account information where
scammers might be able to get ahold of it), and I'll go ahead and submit it
to Sony.  I'll even do all this free of charge because I'm a nice guy and I
wouldn't want to take advantage of you.
