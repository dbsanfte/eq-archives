I don't know the stats for that staff off-hand, but whatever I might
estimate would not be as good as running a log and using Pasketti's
Log Parser to check out the results.  If you're comparing a 2hb to
a pair of 1hs it'll be very easy, you won't have to split your log
to separate the 1-hand damage from 2-hand as you would if you did
the same kind of damage (slash or crush) with both alternatives.
Since you can't control the exact levels of the mobs you fight I'd
suggest making sure you have a fair sized sample of the same mob
for each type of damage.  And yes, if you are not tanking then your
main concern is how much damage you do, while when tanking your main
concern is how much you can make the mob hate you.  Note that this
is why many (most?) of us tank-type melees (Warrior, Paladin, and
Shadowknight) carry more than one weapon setup with us, so we can
switch to suit our role of the moment.
