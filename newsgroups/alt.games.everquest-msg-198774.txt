May 19th 2003

I was at E3 this year and had a great time. I was having coffee when I
ran into the guy that was running the Sony booth the people that make
everquest and also the game that is coming out called Star Wars
Galaxies. I mentioned that I play the Sims online. This is what he
said to me.  If you think that game is botched in some way you should
see Star Wars Galaxies the game is ready to be released the only
problem is they can't keep highlevel players from killing younger ones
sony is reluctant to release the game until this is worked out because
it will be utter chao's. and will turn many people off the game with
no form of control. So if I was you buddy I would stick with the sims
on-line. or everquest its a decent product but i have to tell you my
personal feelings are that star wars galaxies is going to be a major
disapointment I think people are expecting too much. I found this
interesting anyway so I thanked him for talking with me and he gave me
a handful of nvidia mints he was a nice guy though but I thought that
was an interesting statement.
