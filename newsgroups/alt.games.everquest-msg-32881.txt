Should have mentioned, I do.  It is far too often resisted particularly by
the Rhinos and Tigers.  Usually I Malise, then Tagar's.  Even if Malise is
resisted I Tagar's, rather than wait for Malise to be ready again.  Then, if
Malise was resisted, and Tagar's was resisted, I cycle again.  If they were
both still resisted, I may try again, depends on my mana, whether or not I
have clarity going, what the mob health is at.  If there is no enchanter in
the group I will cast Quickness on the tanks somewhere in there as well.
