I dont think the Ranger community is asking for a one kill wonder bow. It
would be nice however if they came close to the damage of a sword. Your a
Ranger for god's sake. Your also in a level based game in which the damage
that you can inflict on a MOB is based on your level, the skill in the
fighting style you choose, and the level of the MOB. Not to mention the fact
that the arrow is expendable. Asking for a bow to be more than just an item
to pull with is not too much to ask.

Which is why they should at least do as well as some swords, not all.

Here again, history has nothing to do with it. With the arrow being
expendable, I personally don't think it would to hard to make the bow a
little more useful in combat. I mean hell, your sword doesn't downgrade as
you use it...it never goes dull.
