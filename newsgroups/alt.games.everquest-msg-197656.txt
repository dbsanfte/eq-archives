I started playing shortly after Kunark was released.   I hate asking
for a port except when I REALLY have to get someplace quick (like for
a raid or something like that).  Fortunately, there very few places
nowadays that I need a port to get to.  But way back when, I tended to
hoof it, and used to get anoyed at the people shouting for those real
short-distance ports all the time (Typically, from Northern Ro, or
Freeport to West Commons).  In the time it took them to actually get a
port, I could have run the distance twio or three times, unSowed.  In
some people's imagination, the run from Freeport to West Commons was
terribly long..

I think the lowest level I ever crossed the continent was at 4 with my
Erudite chanter (which is when he got invisibility) to complete a
quest that ended in Freeport..  Since then, I've sponsored a couple of
races on my server for the guilds I've been in, called 'Streak Across
Antonica', where 1st level PK players, bound at the Freeport docks,
compete to be the first to cross Antonica to get to the Qeynos docks.
PK means that they can't be buffed or bound (except by soulbinders).
We also have the restriction that the players can't ask for help (to
clear the way for them or kill whatever agros them), nor can they
leave the continent (such as by taking spires or PoK books).  With all
these restrictions, last year, everyone that participated actually
completed the race succesfully in under 3 hours, with the best time
being like 45 minutes (guy was gutsy -- he crossed Kithicor at night,
and high hold pass without incident, 2 of the hardest zones to get by
safely.  And everyone is pushing for me to run the event again this
year.

I understand how tiresome running cross-country can be, but I think
everyone should try to do it at least once, at least at low levels
when the cost of failure is low (or stick all of your equipment in the
bank before trying it).

                                                 -Haldur
