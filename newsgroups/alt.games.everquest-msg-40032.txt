Maybe you're different than me, but I don't play the game because
thousands of total strangers do - I play it because it's fun. And I
won't quit playing it just because others do - I'll quit playing it
when it's no longer fun.

And if you can't tell when server population is low by merely playing
the game, then you're not paying very close attention.

Giving customers exact server load counts isn't customer support, it's
pandering. Customer support involves keeping the game enjoyable. You
can enjoy the game quite well without the raw numbers.
