Cyber weddings? What next? Cyber EQ bridal and baby showers? Batchelor parties 
with orgre and troll babes lapdancing? How about Cyber EQ divorce courts and
Property Settlement Agreements?

Cyber EQ Weddings DESERVE to be trained if held in unsafe areas. It's called
natural selection!

Like go to a Cleric or Pally Guild Hall and (gag) get married there. Better yet
do it in real life.

What next? I know ! AN EQ Cyber Newlywed game!

Fed up  with these kids running around the newbi zones asking every female
character (most porobably played by guys) to marry them.

Just imagine waking up the morning after (EQ cyber of course rolling over in
bed, only to discover that the lovely Yolonda nee Spiritweaver needs a shave.
