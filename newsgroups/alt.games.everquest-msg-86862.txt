Well, seeing as I can't seem to get it to work at all...  and after reading
this, I think I'll just stick to manually updating at the site when I pick
up new stuff...  hehe  I like the idea of being able to look at my inventory
without having to log onto the game (for those times when I'm wondering what
the stats are on my current item and which item would be a better item and
blah blah blah) but I can't get the thing to automatically update at all...
I tried to download the .ini file that it says you need, but when I try I
get the message that the file is corrupted.  Hmmm...

Anyway, take care guys...

Oh, and also cannot find a server that I can upload graphics too and then
link from Mag site for bkgrnd and so forth.  Geo and Tripod both work the
first time and then the pic won't come up again after that.
