I'd certainly want at least one beastlord, the first new class
in the game since day one!

Two beastlords would be my natural inclination, in fact.

Beastlord/Bard would be another strong contender, as a bard
is a class that tends to be able to fill in the gaps and boost the
performance of any class, sort of a jack of all trades, if master
of none... and its a class that you couldn't do as an Iksar.  Bards
also have an ability to make nice with NPCs all over Norrath,
so if Vah Shir have any faction problems, this would give you
some remedy to that.
