Another poster said that an EQ2 death (presumably still at fairly
low levels) meant you got debt which took about 10 mobs to pay off,
during which time you got about half the normal xp.  So that's
roughly the same needing to kill 5 mobs to regain lost xp (except
you never lose a level since you never really lose the xp).  Does
anyone know if the amount of debt (and hence amount of xp needed to
repay the debt) goes up at higher levels, similar to how the xp
penalty in EQ1 is bigger at higher levels?

Also, about EQ1, how bad does it get?  Last night my 47 monk died
and it seemed to cost me about 8-10% of a level, which was painful
but not excruciating.  (I was in LOIO and didn't feel like paying
a cleric to come out that far, though I did end up getting a 35%
rez from a handy Paladin.)  I've never had a higher level character,
so I don't know how big the xp loss gets.  How bad it is at level 65?
Level 70?

I've seen formulas for the xp per level, and xp per mob, etc.  Has
anyone ever managed to work out a formula for the amount of xp lost
when you die?
