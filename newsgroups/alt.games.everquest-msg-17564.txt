Personally I think the in game economy is way to high.  I
sell most of the auction worthy stuff at about half the
going rate normally.  This gets it gone fast and gives me a
better price than vendors will.  Even at that I only go to
EC tunnel when I am looking to buy some stuff for myself
(although since my INT is nearly at 200 and items that give
mana give so little as to be worthless I am nearly done with
that).
