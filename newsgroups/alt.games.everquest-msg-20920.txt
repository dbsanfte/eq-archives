These are radically different situations; sure, I'll occaisionally PL
guildmates (one? Nah, get a full party of twinks together, don't waste
my time) or friends.  Heck, just slapping 49 cleric buffs on
anyone under the age of 20 would constitute PL if they know what
they are doing and wouldn't consume much time at all.

But some random begger off the street?  And a Dark Elf at that?

Offering to "pay?"

I think its the offer to pay that most astounds me.  I guess if
I spent time leveling at the wall in DL I'd think of 50pp as
a princely sum (ooooooh,, bronze armor!)
