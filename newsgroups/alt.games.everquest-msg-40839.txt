Well then I guess I am...and you have the right to think of me that way
because of people like me and be able to voice it without fear of
retribution...dont ever forget that.
And YES, I proudly support and defend that  right.  (that is of course if
you are a US citizen).

You might feel differently if it was your town with people you knew...people
die every day...some naturally and some due to outside forces.  I am sure
you contemplate each and every one because they all mean so much to you.

It must be nice to sit and be critical of my point of view without having
taken an equally weighted oath.
