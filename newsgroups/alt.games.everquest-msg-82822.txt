Actually, warriors can solo, just not well. A handful of bandages and
stick to low blues after your 20's. In fact, I hear stories of people
whizzing through levels on low blues because they don't take as much
damage from them and can mow them down relatively quick. Between
keeping bandaged up to 50% and not having to med up mana, they say
it's pretty effective soloing...
