A lot depends on what you want to do with your chanter.  Assuming you
are going to play him to a high lvl then I'd probably agree with the
STA suggestion for inital stats.  I started out many moons ago
following the then reasoning of Int & Cha as primary.  I now have 281
int before VoQ & a bag full of 6 int augs unused.  Cha is 250 unbuffed
too & a similar supply of cha augs (have so far only put 1 point into
IE so int cap is 290 & cha 280 - working on LR5 first).

At low levels easily obtained gear like Stein of Moggok / Opal Stein
will cheaply augment your int cha stats.

If your going to charm stuff then CHA is going to help, otherwise keep
this gear handy in a pack & concentrate on int, hp & mana.  Int
governs your mana pool so the higher it is the longer you can cast. 
At lower levels most of us would have been carrying around lots of
gear to change into as circumstances changes.  Generally an int set,
cha set & resists for raiding.

With regards following, Agnostic wasn't an option in my day so I don't
know how beneficial it is.  I have rarely had faction issues that an
illusion & colaboration spell line couldn't solve outside of SoV.
