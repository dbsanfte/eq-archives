Hmm actually I never remember that, playing since phase 3 of beta.

I always could, as soon as the game was retail my first
char fished while medding, by hitting number key 3 while
the spell book was up.

Hmm can't remember that either.

Same.

>- you only had 36 hot keys

Ah because only 6 showed, yeah I get you.


>- friends list was same for all chars on all servers

Well, I hope so, that was recent.

>- Mayong Mistmoor would wipeout zone every 12 hours or whatever

Ahaha yeah, back when Mayong existed.

Pretty recent to me.. but its been a while now.
Those changes made my druid a goddess, well more of one anyway.
Great change for druids.


>- jboots would work in dungeons
>- jboots DROPPED in najena and were sold on ebay regularly

Yep, and the side effect quest I got on tribunal with my druid to do
when trib was new. Where the ac is now was an ogre, with another
ogre by the ruins on pirate island. As a druid, you could bind on
sisters island at level 19, kill both ogres and loot their heads every
15 minutes or less (Basically as soon as you could gate back from
turning in the heads), port self to butcher, turn the heads into
ogrebane
at the warrior guild in kaladim, get XP/factions and an ogre war maul.

After getting to level 14 on the trib server, they nerfed jboots
making it a quest and forever ruined my dream of an ogre war maul
every 15 minutes. You can still do the quest, and people are happy to
let you loot the heads, but you won't be getting them every 15 minutes
(boog is just one of the AC cycle mobs and his brother only spawns
when he does)


>- you didn't get a message when spell wore off

When it was wearing off, yeah, I get what you mean though.


>- Every single froggie in Guk was decalred to be part of a "camp"

AAAHAh that still kind of happens now.


>- you didn't get a message saying what was looted when in group

Ahaha yeah. "nothing!", yeah sure, you lying bastard.


>- we would do alpha loot to 5 plat or fine steel

Ahahah that still happens now in newb groups on newb servers. Last
time was when I made a new char on FV.


>- mask of deciever (illusion dark elf) was all/all and dropped

YEAH HOLY SHIZNIT I DO. My second nerf story. I was on tribunal and
level 31 druid and ABOUT to go to guk to get it, the ranger friend of
mine who got there made an exclamation because it was changed that
day.. suck. So i missed it by like a day.


>- pets would proc sword of runes on anything

Ahaha yeah.

>from beta.

Ah ok, I was in since phase 3 but beta was kind of a blur. I basically
was out of work right then and played 24/7 through phase 3 and 4.
