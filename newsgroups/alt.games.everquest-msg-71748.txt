Hehe... I am mage and do what I do... its much easier

Get pottery skill up  to around 105 or better, then make Thurgadin
Gate potions... 

You pop in right next to bank!!

The only pain in butt about gate potions is they are lore and the
container you made it in goes poof after potion is made.
But you can get another container when you gate there.

Other then that its a bit of a tedious chore collecting all the
crystaline spider silk and pieces of velum.
