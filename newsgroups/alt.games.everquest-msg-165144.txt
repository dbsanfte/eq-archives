I think the problem is that uber-cool items shouldn't require
doing a 20 hour camp.  Instead, they should require 20 one hour
camps, or 40 half hour camps.

Keep the player moving, motivated, and interested.  Keep them
in a state where they can readily see their progress.

Waiting more than an hour or two for something to drop is just
plain stupid design.  That's tedious, not fun.  You can still
demand the same number of hours out of the player -- just keep
those hours *entertaining*.
