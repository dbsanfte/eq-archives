All pretty much correct. As far as powers, they can indeed summon corpses
from anywhere in a zone(like when it gets stuck in a wall, etc). They can
also summon a player from any zone to their position in any other zone(very
useful when the boats break down). They can also(at least used to be able
to) xp rez as well. They also serve as the primary investigators in cases of
harrassment, exploiting, and other matters of policy violation, and they
have the power to issue warnings as well.

Basically, they're wildly underpaid front-line customer support for the
game. They take a lot of stupid bullshit from players, and get a free EQ
account for a minimum of 10 hours of work a month(comes out to maybe 25
cents per hour). And that's 10 hours that they take out of their normal play
time.
