*Hands DT a clue*

Sony is a multi-billion dollar corporation.  EQ's single biggest cost of
operation is bandwidth.  And you think they wanted to help out the
*shrinking* minority of people on sub-56k dialups, instead of merely
figuring out they could save $150k a month in operating costs.

Must suck to live in a capitalist society and have such a poor understanding
of how it all works.
