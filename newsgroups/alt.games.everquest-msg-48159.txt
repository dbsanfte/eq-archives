I went ahead and looked at the site, and here are my impressions:

If anyone has played Traveller, it reminds me alot of that system. You'll be
a spaceship captain, presumably able to choose your profession.

Merchant?
Smuggler?
Marine?
Mercanary?

It looks like most the game will take place in space, however there will be
space stations that you can visit as well. Beta testing starts "before the
end of 2001."

Now the big question: What happens to this game when the Star Wars MMORPG
kicks off?
