I see you've gotten a lot of "votes" on this from both sides, but here's
my two cents anyway. That guy had gone above and beyond to be nice to
you. When a spawn is uncamped, whether the person went LD, or ran to
merchant, bank, camped for dinner, etc. then it's up for grabs. The fact
you got it back once is amazing and really nice of him.
  Second, your threat to train a red mob onto him and FD should have
been immediately /report trainerName_01 followed by /petition, and you
should have had your account suspended for a few days.
(Hey, you asked.)
