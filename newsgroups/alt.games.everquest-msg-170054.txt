grumble.....i went through:
noob zone
CB
unrest
loio
OT
DL
KC
from 1 to 54. After that i started to farm HGs in lake rathe and Gornit in
OOT and bought nice non visible wis/mana/resist oriented gear. I started my
epic and attended about 20 open hate raids to get me decent visible armor.
Did seb and HS keys and started to go everywhere with pick up groups but
made the bulk of my XP to 60 in Velks /sigh. (all pre sol btw)

And i wouldnt describe myself as a whiner, loot whore or someone who doesnt
know how to play his class :p

Please dont generalise such xp paths resulting in yadda yadda people with no
skills etc :p. Dont forget that you were a noob as well at some point and
made most likely the same old mistakes on your first groups/raids etc.
