I'm very happy to hear this, Pirg.  I'm very glad you got your epic and that
all the time you spent wasn't wasted.

This whole situation reminds me of the cleric epic.  Because of all the
awful fights that would happen in the closed confines of SolB - raids
jumping raids, high-levels destroying giants and whatnot that lower-level
people could use for XP and loot, and all the petitions that resulted - they
decided to move the final Ragefire battle to Skyfire.  They thus solved one
problem... and created a *much* bigger problem.  Now it was far too easy for
one raid to kill-steal another, and it was not uncommon to have four raids
formed and hovering near the place where Ragefire spawned.  Now SOE started
getting inundated with even more petitions, and the Customer Service
headaches only increased.  Finally, they revamped the entire Ragefire
encounter, and while one might argue that it completely gimps the quest -
the cleric epic is now one of the easiest to obtain if you're patient enough
to do the camps - it did make all the petitions go away.

I have the feeling they had a similar sort of blind spot here - that in an
effort to prevent the Shaman epic from being easily MQ'd or done in a single
step, they've created another Customer Service nightmare with many
frustrated customers - and many petitions.  I expect them to solve this -
eventually.  It took them months to fix the Skyfire encounter, so the Shaman
epic may stay the way it is for a while to come.  Or they may have learned
from their previous mistake and they'll quickly move to undo or revamp the
changes they made to the faction requirements.

Anyway, all that is behind you now, at least.  =)  Grats on your epic.
