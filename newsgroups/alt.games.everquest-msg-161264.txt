First, NO HTML!  Now that that's out of my system....

You need to have at least one skill in all five of the specializations.
Only one will be allowed to go over 50.  Just chain-cast a spell of the type
type that you wish to have as your prime specialization so that the skill
will go over 50 first.

My guess is that you have 4 skills all stuck at 50 and one at 0 based on
what you wrote (it was not clear).  If so, go to your trainer, drop another
point in the last Specialization and then go and cast Alteration spells
until Spec: Alt hits 51 (assuming you want to specialize in Alteration).
