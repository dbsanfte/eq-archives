Hey guys,

I recently won a raffle on an MMO gane site. I was shooting for the EQ2 
expansion, but instead I won the Secrets of the Faydwer expansion for EQ, 
which I no longer play. It is signed by the Devs all over the box, and came 
with an EQ coin in a bag.

As I no longer play, before I EBay it, I thought I would check here first.

If you would like to make an offer contact me at: avoset-99020@mypacks.net
