One small nit to pick here. When getting my casters skills up to snuff it IS
more work than game, sitting around repeatedly chain casting spell after
spell. Do I mind do ing this ? No, not really, the reward for it, ie maxxed
out casting skills, is worth the time I put in for it. Would I really rather
be doing somthing else ? Of course I would. For me its known up front that I
will have "work" to do when i make a caster char.
