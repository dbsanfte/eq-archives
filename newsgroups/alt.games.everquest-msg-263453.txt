Have they said anything about Epics in EQ2 or anything like that?  The Epic
quests in EQ1 really annoyed me.  As a Wizard, my quest was basically get a
drop from Phinny, get a drop from a rare mob in Fear, and get a drop from
Venril Sathir, and run around talking to a few NPCs.

This annoyed me because every one of these was very very very hard for me to
even attempt with the casual guild I was in.  Fear required a raid, and the
mob for the Wizard quest wasn't even up that often.  Phinny only required a
group or two...but the drop was a rare drop off him, so getting that would
basically require asking the guild to spend a long time doing Kedge--a zone
they had no interest in--over and over and over and over.  So, basically,
the quest was a "see how much crap your guild will put up with to get you an
item that doesn't even really make you all that much better on raids"
affair.

And, just to make it even more annoying, major NPCs on the quest were in
Halas and the High Elf city.  Not the kind of places a Dark Elf Wizard likes
to go.

What I want in my next MMORPG is one where if I play casually, I still have
a reasonable shot at the major things of my class, like the Epic if the game
has one.  I expect it to take a lot longer real time than for a hard core
player, but it should not be basically out of reach.  Does EQ2 fit the bill
here?
