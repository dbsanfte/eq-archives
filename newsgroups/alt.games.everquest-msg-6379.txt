Funny thing is how many people say this.  Or "You will eventually
twink too".  Not true.  Considering I am non-twinked and have over 10k
in the bank, I could have MUCH better eqiupment than I have and m'lady
REALLY needs upgrades.  A couple she will eventually get as wedding
presents, but she still has mostly banded and low level magic items at
20.

I have the money, I just also have the willpower not to start another
character and give it to them.
