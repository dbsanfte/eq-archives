OK, I don't mean this in any kind of negative or offensive way, but if you
plan to always solo, EQ is not the game for you.  There are a few classes
that can solo.  Necromancers are good, I heard druids are pretty good too,
but definatly not warriors.  If you want a good soloing game, I'd go for a
single player RPG (because then you wouldn't have to pay for it), or if
you're looking for a MMOG I'd probably try WoW because, from what people
say, all classes can pretty much solo to the top levels with no problem.

With EQ, they designed it to encourage (or in other words force) players to
group and interact.  The classes were designed to work together and help
each other out.  That's why if you've ever been in a group they always look
for a healer and a tank, then fill in the other spots with some kind of dps
or crowd control.  I'm sure if you've been reading the posts here you've
learned that temp isn't as great when you get up into the higher levels, so
it becomes very hard to solo, and a warrior is one of the most group
dependant classes.

Again, not trying to offend you or anything.  I'm not one of these guys
that's gonna cuss you out or say you're a bad player.  I just don't know how
long you've been playing and if all your toons are low level then you may
not know how the game works when you start getting to the mid and high
levels.  Of course, another option is to just keep creating new toons, which
isn't such a bad way to go.  You level fast, any class can tank, get a temp
and you can take on 5 orcs at once...  Anyway, I'll stop before I start to
ramble, but I would consider finding another game that's easier to solo if
that's what you're into.
