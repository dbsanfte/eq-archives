Sure you can petition.  He admitted to purposely screwing you over with the
taunts.  /report then /petition (must do both).  Something may not happen
immediately but there's a decent chance something will happen eventually.

Revenge will only get you warned.

Meanwhile post the chat log on the server's message board and on his guild
message board.  THAT is revenge unless you were an asshole in chat, then
don't do it...you'll only get flamed.
