Everything was working fine on my XP home system with my GeForce 256 card,
then ...

Got a new P4 motherboard (CPU and memory) and installed it.

Reinstalled XP home all software including EQ, everything checks out,
passes the directX test, EXCEPT EQ now has problems.

I get the screen's icons displayed on the EQ screen just after you
select the server.  Additionally the tray's icons flash while playing the
game.
(Time flashes 1/4 sec every minute too).
If I hide the taskbar the flashing icons do go away, but ...
Additionally a white curser arrow stays on the center of the screen (I still
have a curser)

I tried the new nvidia driver (6.13.10.2942), I tried an older driver
(5.01.2001)
I tried another nvidia card
I have NVIDIA GeForce2 256   I tried a  NVIDIA GeForce2 MX 100/200, same
problem

Everquest's tech help just say "driver problem"

Thanks
