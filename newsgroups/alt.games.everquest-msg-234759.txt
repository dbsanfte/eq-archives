I'm going to actually side with Darktyger on this one.

Seeing as the records are physically in Hong Kong you can't simply
have a judge subpoena the records. Its outside of American
jurisdiction. If a subpoena were issued it would be unenforceable.
Everything would have to be worked cooperatively with HK law
enforcement to get their support and cooperation, that makes it
decidely more of a hassle.

I don't know anything about American / HK (Chinese) law enforcement
agreements but I wouldn't hold too much hope out for an "easy" time of
it.
