Exactly how I feel about Oasis and LOIO. *heh*

The Warrens is good exp and good loot. If you are willing to pick up
and sell EVERYTHING that gets dropped, you WILL make money there.
There have been times I literally crawled out double-encumbered and
made 30-40 pp on a session. The bamboo and bronze weapons sell for a
nice amount. If you want to be choosy, the bamboo bokkens sell for
close to 7pp. The wicker armor is basically leather with a unique
look. The occasional splint is almost-banded. The molars are turned in
to the appropriate NPC for good exp, good faction and a roughly 25%
chance of a piece of ringmail that you can wear or sell.

At level 16 you're mostly done with the hall trash in the Prince's
wing though you'll still be aggroed by it from time to time. You're
ready to make the rounds of the named kobolds and the pit fighters.
It's possible to solo in the Warrens if you really want. I spent half
of my first 20 levels there on and off, soloing most of the time, and
I am now amiable in Paineel for excursions into Stonebrunt.

Hunt the Warrens up to 20/21 and you'll be ready to solo some of the
bigger nameds and to head to Stonebrunt where you can easily do 3-4
more levels just on the kobold camps next to the entrance.The stuff in
the King's Room and Muglwump cave are also good all the way up into
the early 20's.

Don't let the "Odus is the boondocks" crowd convince you to leave. Do
a couple of levels there, and see for yourself.
