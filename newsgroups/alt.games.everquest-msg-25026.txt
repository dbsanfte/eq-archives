In pick-up groups it's kinda hard to go NBG.  If a 20k SK item dropped in my
group of me and 5 strangers, one of them being an SK, there's no way in hell
I'd want to just give it to him.

Research items?  Sure.  Gems to cover reagent costs?  Sure.  But since I'm
taking the same risk I should have the same chance at the reward.

I'm talking about pickup groups ONLY.
