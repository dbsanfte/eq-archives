Aside from what you have mentioned:

-You have the trueshot disc.  Bring lots of arrows to your group
situations.  Every 70 minutes, /disc trueshot with your archery buffs
up and dex gear on.  At the very least you will do fairly good damage
even at 160 skill, for short periods of time.

-Try to be the puller whenever you can.  Snare the mob, plink it all
the way back.

-When the mob runs, plink away

-Fearkite and shoot arrows instead of chasing the mob with your
swords.

-Sometimes you may be soloing and need to root and heal before you
finish the MOB.  Make a hotbutton for sit/stand and another one right
next to it for ranged attack.  When the situation calls for it, you
can root the MOB, get back and heal up.  But if LOM, you can sit, wait
for ranged attack to pop, and quickly hit the keyboard buttons that
correspond with stand-ranged attack-sit.  Do this over and over and
you can effectively med up while also doing reasonable damage to the
MOB.  When you are good to go back in, just run in and finish him off.

Look for any opportunity to shoot whenever you dont really need to be
in doing anything else.  Remember that you still need a lot of AAs and
level 59 before you are going to use archery regularly, so you have a
long time to bring it up.
