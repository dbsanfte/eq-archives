According to the manual it is being logged in to the SERVER not the
CHARACTER that counts, so if you play another character on the same server
or sit at the character select screen, the timer is running ... could this

"leaving your computer at the character select screen or play on another
character on that same account counts as time in game as it relates to the
corpse decay timer."
