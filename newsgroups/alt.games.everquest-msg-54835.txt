This is Correct in WC the DE camps were empty, event or not, and the new
mobs were spawning during event times all over the zone. In EK they
replaced the bandit camp near the gorge.   I also got luck and looted
the belt.  A guild mate got the dru clr sham head piece that was 4ac,
4wis, 4 mana 4 vs disease.  I would trade my runed circlet in a second
just to have that extra 4 mana and the disease resist.  And yes i know
the items are no drop, but i would hope you know what i mean when i say
trade here.   The belt was a huge upgrade for me as i was wearing a
thick leather apron, so while i lost 2 ac, I gained 5 wis, 5 sta and 5
vs magic.  From what i noticed the events were geared to be level
appropriate.  N. Ro seemed to be for those 15 and less.  WC seemed to be
for the 20 30 crowd.  EK was 30 to 40 crowd, and Rathe Mtns was 40+. 
While alot of ks/accusations of ks was going on, people were also
helpful in shouting out locations or shouting they had drop x for class
x send a tell for location.
