OK you have several options here.

If the goal is to replace the existing C: drive (system drive with
Windows installed on it, then you will have to decide if you are doing
a complete reinstall of the Operating Ssystem, or would rather image
the old drive onto the new one.

I would recommend a completely new installation of the OS. 

Here is what I would do....

Remove the original drive. Install the new drive as a stand-alone
master, and plop in your WinXP disk. Use the format and partition
utility that is part of the WinXP installation process to setup 2
partitions:

1. C: drive for the OS (I like an 8-19gb partition for the OS)
2. D: drive for Apps, Games and files.

The reason I recommend a seperate OS partition is because it gives you
the option of reinstalling the OS at anytime without affecting your
data files that you have loaded on the second partition.

Once WinXP is completely loaded, patched, drivers installed etc.
Install the old drive as a slave to the new one. You can then copy
over anythying you need from the old drive. Once you are 100% sure
that you have everything you need off of the old drive you can format
it, remove, it, or do whatever you want with it.

The beauty of this, is that if you screw something up, you can always
put the old drive back in and be right back where you started with no
data loss.
