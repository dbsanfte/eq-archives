An Iksar shaman won't get owned even without bazaar gear, not unless he 
is somehow significantly inferior to a barbarian shaman in crappy 
nonbazaar gear at those levels.

I managed somehow to solo at all levels, never once having owned a single 
piece of jaundiced bone armor.  Grouping is certainly preferable to 
soloing my shaman, but, I can do respectably with him.  I only very 
recently bought any bazaar gear at all, so that had nothing to do with 
it.  I do realize that compared to the really good soloing classes, my xp 
rate is probably rather low when soloing.  In my 40s and 50s my gear was 
way too sub par to melee, I root rotted for the most part, then starting 
using my pet to tank.  It's only been in the last few levels that I find 
myself doing a lot more sponging for my pet, particularly since I got 
torpor, and then quiescence.  PoP mobs I still root and rot however when 
soloing them.
