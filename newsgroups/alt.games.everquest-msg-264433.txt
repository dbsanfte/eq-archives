Every once in a while, when two mobs are under attack and close together,
there will be a message something like: "A Rochopper begins to use A
Rockhopper as a living shield".  Will you please explain this further.  What
are they doing and how?  The shortly the message is : "A Rockhopper ceases
using A Rockhopper as a shield"  or paraphrased.  So then, why did they
stop?
