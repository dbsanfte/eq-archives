No chart but if you have 70 agil at level 60 adding 5 agil = about 40
ac I think. 75 agil is the minimum for no penalty. Anything above 75
piling on the agil is not that beneficial and an item with ac always
gives more ac than an item with agil. The higher agil you are at the
fewer ac you might get from adding more agil. When in doubt always go
for ac and hp (possibly including sta points) and your main class stat
instead of agil.
