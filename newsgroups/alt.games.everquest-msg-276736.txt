It seems when Zek's consildated they let all the toons that were
affected transfer afterwards.  On Modern Rasp, it feels as if we were
invaded by them.  My ignore file has grown twice as long as before due
to casino scammers, beggers, and general idiots.  Also, have seem more
instances of Ninja Looters (maybe just the Fabled bringing out the
ugly, shrug).  Is it just me, or did other servers get a whole bunch of
griefers too ;p.

Oh yeah, NE on Modern Rasp (Kiix), thanks for the KS and the train from
the Warlord.  I guess the 12 peeps standing in front while taking out
the side and back mobs were just in the way of your pull from the front
of the zone.  Good job in pulling the whole room and dropin the adds on
us while buffers were medding.  Ignore file just got one added.

BTW, two guild transfered over that I know off (Wolves of Zek and EOD,
some seem nice, some seem blech).

Straight Broken Mes, and what do you mean assist, I am assisting by
nuking all these mobs with my ubber aoe)
