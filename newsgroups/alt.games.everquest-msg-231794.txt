Aye but the fact that by the sounds of it this toon died every
solitary time, makes it sound that the toon was out of place. 

I also didnt say that there was nothing other than MT to do, but the
primary job on a raid is the MT, if you wanna sit and chain CH some
twink so they can loot something later, feel free, but I cant see many
clerics gonna do that

For the preliminary mobs casters should not be likely to die, and the
fact that this one died so much really just says to me that it was
cannon fodder, and trying to keep it alive was probably an impossible
job.  On a raid, I expect to be healed only if the MT is looking good.
The fact it didnt happen just once or twice suggests that the player
wasnt able to 2 box in a raid situation.
