you dont have to succor anymore and yes its funny to hear someone talk
in a different language. I saw The guy i trained with later on in
another group. Since we had mastered elder dragon, elder tier dal,
faerie and elder elvish.....when i joined group he said hello in elder
dragon, then i replied in elder tier dal "lol....your the only one who
can understand me"...then in elder dragon another group member said
"no...i can hear you as well".
