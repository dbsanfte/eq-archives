Actually to quote him directly "She was hit by a truck but I'm glad the
bitch is dead" and it's nice to know that Avenger is married to a 3 yearold.
Oh...you mean ACTUAL age...I thought he was referring maturity wise. What a
sad day when someone is happy that their former life partner was killed.
Maybe he pushed her...ya think?

No need to spread another one of your lies for you...btw...who fucking gives
a shit who the Texas State Paintball champion is? That's like being proud of
being the clam eating champion of Bumfuck Egypt.

No...you said and I quote "I look like Ricky Martin...only better looking."
I can easily retrieve that post from the Bigweek archives along with all
your other fabrications.

Oh...so now you're adding professional soccer player...there's a new one.
Mob like...rofl...so what you're saying is you're very fat, you have a big
nose and you walk like you've got a grapefruit wedged in your asshole?
Yeah...I guess I can picture it.

If I saw you in person, I think the last thing I'd be is intimidated. I'd be
too busy closing the blinds so you'd stop looking in my window while I'm
trying to change clothes.

> > What have any of you done?

Gotten a good laugh from your post is what I've done...bragging was really
never one of my forte's. I leave that to people that have no real lives and
figure they can be whomever they choose to be on the internet.
