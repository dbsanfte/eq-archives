I tried Ornate Chain.  I even went to Qeynos (for the first time ever, can
you believe) and looked all over the city to find the relevant ore, and upon
seeing him out of stock, and wanting me to do some stupid farming quest in
perma (or was it EF, either way same thing)..  I realised this was just not
worth the time or effort.

Doesnt the pelt and silk part imply I'd need a tailoring skill also (or have
to rely on a tailor)?

Well.. thats another one ruled out.   I wonder if somebody has dented my
