You can add a proc to a weapon that already has a proc and they will both
work.  There is some debate as to whether both may go off in the same swing.
IOW the second proc may not proc as often as it would if it was on a weapon
by itself.  To your second question yes stats add and the item will show it
as 10 stamina (for example) if the item had 5 sta and the aug added 5sta.
If you have an item with an effect such as mana regeneration +1 (formerly
known as flowing thought) and add a mana regen aug then they both will also
work.  I think the only things that do not add is haste and bard mods
(brass, string, etc).
