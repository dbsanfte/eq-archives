For god's sake start learning some fucking English you dumbass. You

Keep up, if you can.

Take your own advice!

I haven't moved one iota. You've simply been unable to grasp the
difference between things bad for raiders and things bad for ME. And
you're still trying to claim you know my point better than I do! I
mean, get over yourself, you aren't that smart.

Actually, it supports the idea that I was not referring to raiders in

ROFL. He's losing it now, folks. You always know when they fall apart
when they start claiming they know what your point is better than you
do.

Now if he could just find some EVIDENCE to support himself, he might
get somewhere! As we see below, however, he fails in the challenge to
find any. Completely, and utterly.

Kris, you're a very sad individual. You lie, you backtrack, you screw
up, you don't admit it when its thrown in your face, and you keep
doing it over and over.

Kris: it was not my point.

>thread & read your post.

And yet, when we do, we do not find what you claimed. And when
challenged for proof, you merely repeated the post that we already
know doesn't say what you claimed.

You've already lost. That's why I can lean back and make fun of you.


>The changes you list dont favor casuals over any other player, and they
>arent bad for the game.

Since "favoring casuals over raiders" was not my point (despite your
thrashing), and "bad for the game" was an opinion based on my own
preferences (despite your thrashing), you've failed. You failed to
assign me a position I never claimed in the first place, and failed to
differentiate between my opinion and that of raiders.

You are a failure, Kris.

That post does not have any quote in it with me saying Bazaar was
built only for casuals, Kris. Your admission of defeat is accepted
since you failed to quote me saying it.

Yes, I believe it was bad for the game that I prefer. Unfortunately,
no reference to raiders in that. I don't think it was bad for raiding,
Kris. I think it was bad for world elements vs game elements. You lose
again.

Wrong, Kris. You misread the point. And you will continue to do so,
because you are a very, very stupid person.

The first point is false - that is exactly what it was put in for, and

And I find neither claim. How come you won't post where I said the
changes ruined  the game, and how they are for casuals only?

Are you hiding from your claims now? Backtracking again, are you?

Here is Kris's claims which he would like to forget he made, just for
the record. Unlike him, I can actually find quotes from him backing my
point up.

>You were the one ranting how it was a massive conspiracy of the "casuals"

How come you haven't found the quote for that yet, Kris?

>That was never the point moron, the bazaar wasnt BUILT just for casuals

How come you haven't found the quote for that yet, Kris?

You keep saying "read your own quote below" but there is nothing in it
to back you up, and your inability to quote any part of it anywhere
where challenged to do so simply reinforces you already know you're
full of shit.

No, it's stupidity. And your outright lies.

Wow halfway through the post and you still haven't given a single
quote to show me saying the changes were only for raiders (quote of
yours above directly accusing me of saying that) OR a single quote
showing me saying the changes were bad for raiders (ditto).

How come you've failed to find those quotes, Kris?

You inferred incorrectly, dipshit. That is your fault, not mine.
Especially since I've told you repeatedly I didn't imply anything of
the sort.

Your getting your ass kicked by someone with a teensy little rat
brain, Kris! How embarrassing for you....

Still no proof of those quotes yet either....

No, Kris, it's not. And if you think it is, how come you can't quote

I'll keep asking you to do so until you concede its not there. This
evasiveness of yours will not work. I have infinite patience.

Let's just start with you. You admit that these things were good for
casuals yet?

You realize, if you do, you are completely validating the entire point
of my post, don't you?

After that, the only thing left is waiting for you to show proof that
I said things I didn't? Something you've failed to do so far?

One wonders if he realizes he's trapped yet....

That is trying to defeat the point by arguing an absurd extreme. They
want more, for doing less than the raiders. Sometimes giving a
proportion of the players what they want is not good for the entire
playerbase as a whole, Kris. Your absurdity above is just a dodge,
since that is not what either I or the casuals have claimed they want.

Non sequitur. I don't care if they do or not. I am just pointing out
their ingratitude for what they've been given.

You failed to back up your claim that the modifications were for
"everyone's" benefit, Kris. You backed down to "majority". Very well,
your backtrack is accepted. I do believe they thought it was for the
majority's benefit; I don't believe they were right, however, and they
certainly weren't for everyone's. Many of the game's current problems
(from my point of view, just so you don't repeat your continuing
problem with telling when I am referring to my own opinions of the
game and the basic raider point of view) stem directly from these
changes which the casuals are so fond of.

Holy shit, my original point reappears! Is this time for Kris to fuck
up again and make claims about my point he can't back up, or will he
have learned?

I dare you, go to google, come back and tell us if that was new text
in the post you replied to, or if it was quoted text from a post you
didn't. Then tell us if it is possible for context to shift in a
thread between two posts from the same person. Then apologize for
lying about it.

Alas the google proof is above, Kris.

I will give you one out: will you admit you messed up in saying it was
"from my own post which I replied to", and it was actually from an
earlier post that was simply unsnipped quotage? If you can admit that
(and you might as well, anyone can check the google links above), I
will drop it and forgive you your "mistake".

You evade the question.


> You claimed changes done for casuals were total crap for
>the game, yet you wont even try to prove it. Is it beyond your capability?

The claim was based on my opinion only, not the raider perspective. As
a personal opinion it is not subject to needing to be "proven", all I
have to do is say I preferred the game before the changes and my case
is made.

This is when you learn the difference between a personal opinion and
an argument to be proven, Kris. Perhaps you are not educated enough
yet to recognize formal writing style; that is not my problem. I am
not interested in making you believe as I do; therefore it remains
just my personal opinion, to be accepted or rejected as you like.

Your attempts to *invalidate* it, however, would be worth something...
if you hadn't fucked up and attacked it on the grounds of how it was
good for *raiders* instead of how it was good for *me*. THAT was your
screwup, Kris. Your first one, anyways.

Troll? If I am a troll, you have very, VERY seriously lost... thank

>Or that you can bribe me to quit an argument you cant win?

I've already "won", Kris, if you need to think of arguments that way,
when I caught you trying to say I was arguing those points were bad
from the raiders point of view (since disproven) and your continuing
failure to provide quotes supporting your accusations.

There's nothing left for me but to watch you thrash... but I so enjoy
that. :-)

The rest of this thread seems to have proven you wrong, in my opinion
- at least, no further points from the defenders of the casuals have
scored on James, Lief, Moopy or the others who have emerged on top.
You're welcome to take it up in those posts if you can.

>
>Raider can put in a few hours over several days in not very challenging

>That's bullshit.

That is a pretty skewed way of looking at things. I may get a pretty
nice mask from Fennin in a three hour raid, yeah... but that is
ignoring the MONTHS of flagging, the fact I would have to win the item
over 30 other people who probably want it, and all the time I put in
leveling up to be able to be useful in a Fennin kill, all the while
knowing that if I fuck up in parts of the Fennin script I could get 70
people killed, and also that with sheer bad luck, one tiny little
mishap from any of the 70 people there, the whole raid could wipe. Do
you casuals think raiders have their gear handed to them? Casuals
don't have to do any of that.

Anyways I know you don't believe in that. You are welcome to do so.
Most casuals don't have any idea what shit the raiders go through to
get the fancy phat lewtz. They tend to think its a matter of showing
up for an hour, going afk with attack on, and then everyone gets
rewarded with tons of drops.

I don't think you'd get a whole lot of argument from people by saying
GoD was not popular.

However that aside, there comes a point where one must simply say,
this is what EQ is, if you don't like it, there are plenty of other
games that offer something closer to what you want. Stop trying to
change this one. Some of us prefer it the way it is to the way the
casuals want it. I do. I also preferred the way it was before it was
changed with the changes I mentioned than to the way it is now, and in
my personal experience that opinion has been justified by the runaway
mudflation and balance problems, among other things.

Let me put it a different way: if EQ was altered to become a first
person fantasy shooter and was programmed so consoles could play it
too, it might become ten times more popular than it is now... but
would I say it was a good change? Would you? Changes that lots of
people would like are still not necessarily good changes.


> If EQ had had a better system in place for casuals to
>advance, my friends would still be playing. We didnt whine for it, and it
>never happened. SO HOW THE HELL ARE CASUALS BEING APPEASED?

You're confused. My points were of casuals being appeased of other
complaints in the past. Few of them had anything to do with
advancement. The casuals greed for advancement without having to do
what raiders did to do so wasn't addressed by me beyond the level
advance to 65 (good for casuals, takes less people and less
optimization to do earlier content) and the exp rate of planes.

However now that you bring it up, here's one the casuals were appeased
by, just as an example - the removal of flag requirements on tier 2
and 3, excluding tactics and sol ro. Pretty darn good change for
casuals, don't you think?

But that's not good enough, is it? You want to advance into Uqua
without having to raid..... I hate to break it to you, but that's not
what EQ is, and that's not what a lot of us want EQ to be.


> We put in

'Nothing' is bullshit. You don't get the same level. You certainly do
get something.

You might find things differently if you experienced it firsthand.

What's the problem? No raid mob starts off at farm level unless it was
underpowered for where it is. Raiders earn their just rewards for
previous effort, and that means at some point every raid will be the
"latest greatest" for a guild. There's the effort you are asking for.
The only reason raiders are coming back after it becomes easy is
because the target only drops two or three items (sometimes booby
items) for a sixty or seventy person raid.

And while to some extent I agree that only part of the raid is really
critical, it's like getting a 5 ac boost - by itself its nothing, but
get a few of those and suddenly it means something. A raider by him or
herself is nothing in a raid - but collectively they mean something.
Some may mean more than others, but everyone contributes in their way,
and in those raids where you're not at "farm status", those little
individual contributions make the difference.

"the bazaar wasnt BUILT just for casuals, and

That's direct proof against you. And also....


"All raiders had a portbitch on a second account?"

"Which raiders love? Which proves raiders are retarded?"

"Raiders like killing greens and handing in batwings?"

"I bet you kept yourself at level 60 to make Quarm more fun, didnt you
Ben."

"Kinda like how POP linked all the raider's zones thru Tranquility?"

"When was the last expansion without a single raid target?"

Wow, look at Kris pointing out all the ways the changes I mentioned
benefitted raiders! Sure looks to me like he's trying to make his
point by showing they didn't just benefit casuals, doesn't it? If only
that had been my point in the first place, he might have gotten
somewhere!

Alas, it wasn't. He may have inferred it, but he was wrong to do so.

Game, set, match.


>I didnt say you claimed the changes only helped casuals, I said that you

You think they weren't? You yourself mentioned several different
things that bugged you, a noted casual, that were removed - things
like travel time and faction. They weren't done only for casuals, but
they were certainly done for casuals.

No, Kris, I never tried. That's your problem. You can't seem to figure
that out.

The "total crap for the game" was, of course, in my personal
experience, not for any general group.

Yep. It is an opinion on the changes that had few to no benefit TO ME.
No reference to it being only benefitting casuals, no reference to it
being negative to the game for anyone but myself. You can try to find
either if you wish, I will still be here waiting.

You lose on the first one. How about the second?

No, Kris. And if you think so, please attempt again to show how they
didn't improve the lot of the casuals. Since that is my point, not the
imaginary points you've tried to argue against, you've completely
failed to address them so far at all.

My opinion is all that's at stake. And your opinion that they weren't
done for "whiney casuals" has no evidence to back it up - whining
casuals did demand most of those things, they may not have been alone,
but they were there.


> Theyre listening to the other 99.99% of the players

Ah, theres some unsubstantiated stats. I was waiting for you to throw
some out. You do seem to be the sort of person who thinks everyone
thinks the same way as you do.

So what? None of that invalidates my point that I felt they were
negative changes, though of course your absurd extreme examples do
nothing but make you look like a raving fanatic. You don't understand
the worldly point of view, you're too meshed in the arcade gamey one.
*shrug*

The fact you don't even know when EQ was released is not a good sign
of you being able to judge what it was like back then, and what was
fun and not.

Yeah, I agree, but I certainly don't agree on what sucks and what
doesn't.

I'm glad you reposted the above, it quite clearly shows I was
referring only to casuals when talking about the benefits, and not
saying they weren't benefits for other groups. Yet more evidence you
were wrong in your judgement of my points.

And to answer your question? It is itself mostly another of your many
strawmen, since I said "appreciate", not "be satisfied". But since you
brought it up, I said that because, as I would say at a different
point, there is no limit to how far the casuals want it to go. You
make content one groupable and a lower set of casuals will complain
that its not soloable. You make something easier and a lower set of
casuals will say its still too hard. It never ends. The laziness and
greed of the casual powergamer knows no lower limit.

Did you know theres posts on EQLive suggesting that a level of LDoN
*below* medium should be put in? Did you know that they are asking for
LDoNs have longer time limits?

Where do you think it ends? There'll always be a new group below the
one that gets satisfied. Always. There has been every time so far.

The answer, of course, is far enough to satisfy YOU. You couldn't give
two shits about anyone else, and don't care if it goes any further.

You could dumb EQ down to the level of Diablo. Instant action, no
downtime, nothing to get in the way of casual advancement. There'll
still be people playing who find it too hard. Should they be appeased
too?

What you don't realize is yesterday's 'casual' was appeased so far
they are today's 'uber'. Today's 'casual' hated yesterday's EQ.
Couldn't handle all the things you've mentioned hating. But there are
still a bunch of us around who liked yesterday's EQ, and we don't
always like the changes made to appease those who hated it. EQ is
still the best of the mmorpgs to me, so I will continue to oppose
changes that continue to put in on its downward slide from what I
considered its best period, the Velious age.

Puhleeze. If you knew me better you'd know how bullshit that is. Most
the group can fill you in if you like. When you do eventually concede
(as you must if you can't find a quote supporting your claims), I will
quite happily allow your last post to go unanswered (assuming you
didn't fire off things that need answering) - there is little honor in
kicking a retreating enemy.

One still thrashing around on the ground as you are, however, is GREAT
fun in kicking. Please continue posting!
