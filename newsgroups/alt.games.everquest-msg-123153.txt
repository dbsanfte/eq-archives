Absolutely...some mobs can cast See Invis, which works to
the chagrin of not only spell users, but rogues as well.

Sneak, on the other hand, works 100% on every mob in the game.
You can sneak behind Cazic Thule if he's got his back turned.
Some mobs have a funny description of where their front arc
is, but it's actually usually pretty small, even on less-than-human
size targets like Urd Wizards in L. Guk.  Also, if you're lucky,
sometimes the sneak can get you past them "between the ticks..."
The server doesn't detect position changes 100% off the time,
just at certain timed intervals.  If you're lucky, you can walk
right past a See Invis mob after the server has decided you're NOT
yet in aggro range and BEFORE it sends a position check to the
client again.

And no, I don't know any way to time that little trick.  I just know
that sometimes you can walk right over a mob that scowls at
you through sneak/hide and as long as you keep moving, it
won't aggro.
