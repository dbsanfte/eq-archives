Hmmm, didn't notice this until after my reply.  If that's true (and I
have no particular reason to doubt it), it's certainly a lot more
significant to a caster than any of the other fatigue effects.  In
which case Augmentation (or a Bard in the group) would be far more
useful than 100+ STA (if, as you imply, 100+ STA doesn't guard against
that effect).
