Let's see: I answer, then you respond, "You must be preoccupied"...

Can we just cut out the middle <wo>man here and say "Sure, I be preocupied
and post occupied and currently occupied"?

I am after all, a man, which is the rough equivalent for a talking dog. It
is a state of existance that I am not embarassed to acknowledge nor deny
that it leads to embarassing situations. I kind of have the opinion there
are two types of men, those what admit it and those what deny it to try and
set themselves apart from those that admit it, thus gaining an advantage
with those that want to believe you can find a man that has more then one
thing on his mind.

I'm reminded of a Woody Allen quote in one of his movies. When asked
~"Do you think sex is dirty?"
Response
~"It is if you are doing it right."
