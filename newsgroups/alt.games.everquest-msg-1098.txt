But whenever you kill something you will gain (or, if you prefer, gaain)
more experience.  E.g., if you kill a level 50 mob in a typical outdoor
zone, you will get 262500 XP, whereas a Druid killing that mob would
only get 187500 XP.  Before the patch, you would have only got 187500
XP, just like the Druid.

This means that recovering from a death sets you and the Druid back
exactly the same number of kills, which is just like it was before the
patch.

Hence, you have not been nerfed at all.
