Only if you want to call Jazz a dragon. I'm sure he'll be flattered. My 
name is Georg.

As for medical transcription, here's the course I'm taking: 
http://www.mtecinc.com/default.aspx (Premier I)

I do recommend reading up on it. You can study from home, just like you 
can work from home. I'm not sure if anyone does offer on the job 
training, because you must be familiar with the vocabulary and various 
formats, and that's a lot to absorb. Most of the work from home job 
offers want experience, or training from a recognized school.

Here's a few MT employers (so you can see what they are looking for)
http://medquist.com/
http://www.healthscribe.com/
http://ascendhealthcare.com/

And the national organization, which has advice on what to look for in a 
school.
http://www.aamt.org/

There's even a newsgroup devoted to it- sci.med.transcription but they 
don't talk about it much.
