As a North American player on Kane Bayle perhaps I can cast some light
on this issue:

1. Kane Bayle is physically located in Europe (Amsterdam to be
precise).  However, unlike Antonius Bayle (located in London) it is
not labelled as a "European" server.

2. Kane Bayle and Antonius Bayle uses the same ruleset as all "older"
Everquest servers.  The three new European servers (labelled as
German, French and U.K.) are actually run by Ubisoft and may use a
modified ruleset, (not sure, I don't play there) including such basics
as using French and German as their dafault languages.  (Also there is
a rumour that characters from these servers cannot be transfered to
the "original" Everquest servers.

3. Kane Bayle is by far the lowest population non-PVP, non-Legends
server.  I've logged on at a variety of times, and it is always at the
top of the server list.  (Which lists servers in increasing order of
population.)
This is probably due to Kane Bayle's unclear status.  Antonius Bayle,
which is labelled as "European" is usually top of the busy list during
prime CET playing hours, but is deserted in the evenings U.S. time.

4.  The player population on Kane Bayle seems very diverse
geographically, our guild has both Europe-based and US-based players,
(and a few Aussies thrown in) but it's almost impossible to tell where
people are from in-game unless you ask.

5.  I have noticed no disadvantage from playing on a server located in
Europe in terms of lag, language barrier, etc.  Of course the other
servers are located in San Diego, which isn't much closer to U.S. East
Coast than Amsterdam.

6.  Despite being new and less populated than most, our server does
have all the elements of the older more mature crowd.  We even have
our own uber-guild.  (Although they may not be as uber as
some...lately I've seen large numbers of them sitting naked in the
Nexus fairly frequently.  LOL )
