As annoying as Oasis can be, (I think of it as a mini LoIO) you are sadly in
the zone that I would reccomend to most players of your level, at least until
you hit 16 or 17 and can move to gnoll groups in Highpass.
  That being said, if you *really* want a change of pace and scenery, you could
try going to Rathe Mountains. On the servers I've played on, this is one of the
most underutilized zones in all of Norrath. Yes, it will generally be fully of
35+ players, but they'll all be in Hill Giant Valley farming for cash. The rest
of that zone actually offers mobs of almost *every* level range. A patient
person could probably level from 14 to 40 there without ever leaving. There are
orcs, bandits, lizardmen, drakes, and a host of other things.
  If you want to try it, print yourself a map of the zone, (you can find one
here:
http://www.eqatlas.com/rathemtns.html )
and take a good long look at the beastiary for the zone:
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=26

Between the two you should be able to identify numerous spots where you could
fight mobs of an appropriate level.  The down side to this is that you will be
*far* from any banking services. If you're a "good" type you'll either have to
make the run through Feerot, Innothule, and three desert zones to get to
Freeport, or through Lake Rathe, SK, NK, EK, and Highpass to get to the keep
for a bank run.

Also, finding other people of your level to group with may be a pain unless you
bring your own friends. (And we all know how well 14th level wizards solo....
he he he). There are some merchants in the zone, though, for restocking and
selling off your loot, so it's not too bad.  You can bind yourself near either
zone line for safety, and if you hook up with some melee types, you can bind
them in the Areana.  Not too bad of a CR, and a *very* safe and nice place to
bind for fighters.
  Good luck.
