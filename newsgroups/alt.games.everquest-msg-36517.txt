Hehe, my druids do the tradeskills, but since my troll warrior need arrows for
pulling i wanted to make him learn fletching. And with the standard troll
warrior intelligence that is a minor nightmare. After spending around 20 min
getting to skill 12 (used 1 skill point on it to start out) i got my druid to
Innothule and got all the wis stuff he could use transferred. Then he had 122
wis, and i my skill gains was a LOT faster.

So Wis/Int DO play a major part in skill increases. And not just for
tradeskills, but for normal skills too. Try to get a troll to level 20 and a
char with high wis/int to level 20.

Then try to get them both to max swimming. Youll see that i mean. My druid maxed
her swimming at 180 now by just swimming whenever she run through
Oasis/NRo/IllOmen.
My level 27 troll still only have swimming at 80 and i spend around 3 hours in
OT and IllOmen swimming around to get his skill up.
