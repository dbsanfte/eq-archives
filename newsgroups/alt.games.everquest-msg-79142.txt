LOL  No offense taken, of course. Different strokes and all that. =P To be
honest, the silence is another of the things I really am enjoying about it,
although I must admit I had a bit of a shocker this morning. Playing 53 druid
and a 36 chanter in EQ, I am bombarded with tells for ports, buffs, power
leveling, etc. unless I go /role and I thought that with this new game my days
of that were finally over. Then out of the blue today, some lvl 3 something or
other sends a tell to my lvl 7 wizzy saying, "PL me to 5 plz?" </em giggles
madly> Needless to say, the answer (once I stopped laughing and picked myself up
off the floor) was "Absolutely not. First, I am only 4 levels above you and have
only one buff to give you. Second, this game isn't very conducive to power
leveling anyway. And third, I'm trying to make 8 today myself and I don't want
to increase my downtime, just to decrease yours. BTW, in the time it takes you
to find a sucker who'll do that for you, you could have killed enough stuff to
ding 5." His response? "But it's harder for me to level than everyone else." Me:
"Why is that?" Him: dead silence </em rolls her eyes> Guess it goes to show
there are users everywhere. =P

Anyway, I haven't canceled the EQ account yet; although I haven't played since
saturday either. (I think that's the longest I've been away from EQ in 2 years.)
Who knows? It may not be as entertaining once the "new" wears off (I will admit,
the world does strike me as a little small), and as my mate pointed out, it'll
be a whole different ballgame once we hit 20 or so and it goes PvP. . .
