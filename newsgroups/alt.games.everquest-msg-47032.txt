As a 33rd level HUMAN monk, I'm somewhat biased here, but I'd take a
human over an iksar any day.  One, our firsts are a bit faster, not a
lot, but every little bit helps.  Two, as far as night blindess goes,
your characters to this point have topped off in the upper teens,
during which time you'll probably be wearing Wu's fighting gauntlets,
which act as a greater light source, anyway.  The nightblindness
doesn't become an issue.  Sure, downtime is a bit more for humans, but
really with bind wound and mend you'll be surprised how much less it
is than for warriors.  The KOS thing is huge, IMHO, as it's tough to
get off kunark when everyhing wants you dead.  Call me lazy, but I
don't want to spend all my time hiding from wandering guards.

Either way, monks are the way to go, we have the absolute, hands down,
without a doubt best skill in the game...feign death.  With it, I
haven't died since level 20, and I solo most of the time.

If you're on Xev, give me a shout, I'll get you started.

Casidey,
Monk of the 33rd
