No, but I'm saying that an individual is much less likely to have a lvl 1
frog with 10K worth of gear, riding a horse/lizard thing on FV than they are
on the non-RP servers.

Since you only get the one character per account, unless you have RL friends
who can twink you (or you're two boxing, with one well established FV
character and one FV newb) you're kinda screwed if massive twinkage is your
thing.

Crash
