I've just started using the MP3 player in the stock interface, and every 
now and then it will start a song and just "click...click...click..." like 
a record that has a skip at the first note of the song. At this time, it 
basically locks up my computer, and I have to power off the machine and 
reboot.

Once it happened, I had just zoned and had not toggled the MP3 player back 
on yet. Another time was while I was ALT+TAB'ed to my web browser looking 
up some info on the web. Basically, I was unable to determine if it was on 
the same song each time or not.

I had a problem with one particular song not playing correctly, but it 
would not affect anything else. It just played through, though not 
producing anything resembling music. I deleted that file with no further 
issues.

Has anyone else had any trouble with the EQ MP3 player? Is it likely a 
problem with a particular MP3 file?
