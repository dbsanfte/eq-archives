That's nice but I prefer this.  I got it from a newspaper. I think it was
either the Tampa Tribune or the St Pete Times.   Someone here said that
americans understand sarcasm but not irony.  I think we do.


5. Who designed the World Trade Center?

 Minoru Yamasaki. He died in 1986. He said:

 "The World Trade Center is a living symbol of man's dedication to
 world peace ... beyond the compelling need to make this a
 monument to world peace, the World Trade Center should, because
 of its importance, become a representation of man's belief in
 humanity, his need for individual dignity, his beliefs in the
 cooperation of men, and through cooperation, his ability to find
 greatness."

 -- from Divided We Stand, A Biography of New York's World Trade
 Center, by Eric Darton.

He was an excellent speaker but not a very good prophet.
