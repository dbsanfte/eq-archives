Heheh, yeah, although I can't do the illusions part.

I started waaaay back when I hunted in Eastern Wastes... jumping off the
bridge was fun.  Watching yourself do that arms-flailing full-panic plunge
was awesome.  =)

The new models don't emulate that as well, alas, but it's still fun.
There's that split-second where you're not sure if you're gonna hit the
water that's pretty fun.  I've only died a couple of times, but that's still
often enough to add uncertainty to every leap.  =)

Now I need to get some illusion potions so I can try it as different races.
Wonder what an ogre would be like...
