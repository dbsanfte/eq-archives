Yeah, but I am assuming he wants to spend the points and get started NOW with
what little profit you can get from patchwork. Putting 21 in to tailoring and 21
in to brewing (for making heady kiolas) would be the fastest.

And if you are pursuing tailoring, DON'T sell your hunted goods. Keep them for
yourself (trust me on this.) Since the path I outlined bypasses studded and
reinforced leather, you can always get a skinning knife (from a smith) and dress
down those pelts to LQ; LQ cat, wolf or bear combined with a silk thread makes
leather padding, which can sell for a FORTUNE to smiths making fine steel plate.
Smiths in my guild often pay 1pp or more EACH, and the padding stacks.
