Check out the big brain on Kad!

My "attempts" are anything but futile, as is evident by your replies to
them.  If you choose to nitpick, I must reference you to line two in the
secondary of the sentence, "sorry I can amuse you further."  Your syntax is
poor, though I assume you're making an effort in saying:

"... anywhere.  Sorry I can't amuse you further."

I'll limit my comments to "You and the rest of the "Idiot Faction" of "Club
Glupost" should utilize your kill file, prove yourselves <unable to cope
with adversity> and go on thinking of yourselves as intellectuals."  It'll
save everyone a lot more time.
