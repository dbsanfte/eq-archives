I never played an mmorpg before and wanted to try one with my new PC.
There was never any chance I would sign up to EQ1 with all the other
new mmorpg being released.

First I thought FFXI or COH but getting into an established one seemed
hard. I have experience on a console ORPG where after a few weeks of
release new people found it very hard to find groups as everyone had
moved on.

So, if Sony hadn't made EQ2 I probably would of gone to WoW.
