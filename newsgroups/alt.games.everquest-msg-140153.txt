My Gateway P4 system runs EQ fine, except that after quitting the game my
sound card doesn't work. This is after the sound has worked fine within
EQ -- but when this happens, the sound is then gone in EQ as in all other
Windows apps. I have to reboot to get the sound back.

I've updated the driver, searched the Gateway and EQ official websites
without finding anything relevant, even updated my motherboard's BIOS -- no
joy. Searched everlore.com and a couple other EQ forum sites but couldn't
find anything about this syndrome.

Anybody had this problem or heard of it? Any pointers or suggestions most
welcome, thanks.
