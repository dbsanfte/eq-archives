  What the subject line says.

  The servers had all been up for several hours and the Bloated Belly is
sunk.  However, nobody tells us.  There's no scrolling banner about it, no
motd, and it's not mentioned in the patch message.  No broadcasts while I
was online either.  Nobody in my guild knows whether or not they're down. I
spent over an hour waiting for a broken boat to arrive before jumping into
chat and having a Guide tell me they're broken.  My /petition doesn't get a
response in over 30 minutes, so I shoot a /tell to one of the two non-anon
Guides on the server.  He tells me to petition, I tell him I already have.
I don't get the impression that he realizes the boats are down (that's real
good) but apparently he is able to verify that they are and he summons me a
few minutes later.

  Basic CS here.  The boat is down on ALL servers and have been for several
hours, this is something that probably was reported within 2 hours of the
servers going up, and it only takes a minute to verify.  Had they made any
attempt to notify their players or staff of the problem, it wouldn't have
resulted in a waste of an hour of my time (and several other players I'm
sure).

  This is why I am so critical of Verant CS.  This isn't even a problem that
stems from their servers being understaffed (which they are), it is the
result of a simple lack of consideration for their customers.  Had someone
been THINKING about us, there would've been some sort of systemwide
notification about the broken boats. Apparently it didn't occur to anybody
at Verant that this might waste a lot of people's time, either that, or they
didn't care.

  So, is this an example of incompetence, lack of care, or what?

  In any case, it's because of episodes like this that I call Verant CS
"mediocre", if I'm in a good mood.
