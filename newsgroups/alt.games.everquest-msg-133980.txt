No, actually, I discovered it on my own about 12 minutes ago. :)

Aigh! The pain! (insert-obligatory-vaguely-PC-statement-here-about

Yeap, that's about exactly what I thought the Enchanted tarot was.  That's 
a great term for it.  Well, the Enchanted is a lot better than some,

B&N, I'd wager. :)  (What'm I telling you this for?  You know where this
