That group is fine, just keep in mind a couple things:

Many skellies HT for 500-800.  For most people, being it by one isn't a big
deal, but often enough there's 2 at once, so try to make sure the right guy
ticks 'em off, and make sure that your healers know about it.

Some skellies (Helots for sure) cast Ice Comet, nuking folks for 1100 a
shot.  You're going to want magic & cold buffs (not a problem with your
group).

Shaman's gonna wanna slow ASAP.  Druid's gonna want to keep enchanter &
cleric alive.

Keep in mind that the only way YOU guys will get out of the zone is
teleport, so when the druid leaves, you're done.

When you first zone in there will be 2 or 3 critters attacking immediately
(usually at least one HT), so make sure that the tank zones in first.
Alternatively you might want the cleric to DA & zone in first by a few
seconds so that he can be ready for the rest of you.

The "bottomless" critters (sperm) drop a tallow candle thingy.  That's the
key to get in the North wing, and only one of you needs it.  It's no-rent so
there's no reason to hang around after getting it.

GET A MAP.  If you fall through the fake floor you will die, and the CR
isn't particularly pretty.  If the druid falls it's particularly nasty.  If
it's someone else you can Evac back to the zone in, kill respawn, then jump
down to the pit below & start fighting your way to your friend's corpse.  If
you do fall, tell them to do their best to get as close to the zone in as
they can, before they die (and they will...the only other possible option is
gating, but that REALLY slows down the dungeon crawl and isn't likely to
work anyway).

If you can't get a key up top, jump down...there are lots of critters down
there to make finding a sperm much more likely.  There's a teleport that
takes you back up to zone-in.
