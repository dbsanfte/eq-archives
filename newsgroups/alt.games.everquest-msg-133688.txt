Sorry, I totally disagree with you with regard to DL vs EJ. I can virtually
guarantee that you can spend your life at the druid rings in DL and never
see a mob, let alone be attacked by one. On the other hand, I can virtually
guarantee that you won't be able to spend more than one minute (ok, perhaps
two) at the EJ drop without having something bash on you and often they're
there at arrival waiting to beat on you and they typically hit hard. I have
never had any problem with travelling through DL, providing I have had lev,
sow and camo, even at low levels. The emphasis is on lev, though, as without
it, it's not the mobs that will kill you but the terrain. The only problems
I have had are when camo and/or sow dropped or, more typically, when I
slipped off a mountain in a snowstorm at night. In EJ I have died three
times to mobs at the drop point and been chased to zone several other times.

As far as binding is concerned, I found FV was best as there is a bank there
(assuming you are good race). The alternative is a spot is a ruins south of
the giant fort in FM.  At level 30 you've almost outgrown LoIO, FM is
better.
