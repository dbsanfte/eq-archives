Well, I don't mind disagreement at all, fact is I'm pretty
disagreeable and last time I checked I didn't hate myself.
I'll admit that I haven't played a pet class (baby Enchanter
doesn't count, pet is very wimpy and uncommandable), I prefer
to damage the mobs myself, rather than having somebody else
do it for me (probably why I always quit playing my cleric alts
when they get close to a level where grouping is advisable).
But it is so incredibly easy to xp with a Druid, untwinked
and ignorant, that I still hold them to be the easiest.  I have
yet to meet a Magician or Necro above L10 even half as stupid
as the 20 stupidest Druids I've encountered.  I didn't say
fastest (hah! one easy mistake dodged), I said easiest.

I have not played my Druid far enough to try quadding, and I don't
know if I'll do it even when I get there, but I won't be the most
efficient of quadders if I do because I always use first-person
view (except to take screenshots) and from what I read that makes
quadding a lot harder.  As it is, taking a bio-break while rotting
a mob is no problem.  And I can single-pull a lot better than a
Mage (outdoors) and I can find another good spot to hunt quickly
if the one I planned on is taken.  What I need to do is stop soloing
and start grouping the Druid tho, need to develop those skills now
rather than later (see my response to Jazz for my opinion of solo
Druid grouping skills).

There's more than one outdoor dungeon out there.  And indoors I have
plenty to contribute to a group, just need to practice and get good
at it.
