First off you miss spelled "Witchcraft" and it's one word.Also there should 
be a comma in there I think--Witchcraft, should I learn?.
Or would it be some periods--Witchcraft...should I learn?
I think to make it more clear it should be--Should I learn witchcraft?
In any case ,no, you should not learn witchcraft .It could lead you down the 
wrong path.



(Hehe just kidding)
