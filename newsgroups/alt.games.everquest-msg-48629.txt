 I think so too. What I really like about the current models is, well,
some of the females are just plain cute looking. All the Wood Elf faces
of course, to me at least, are just plain cute. The Dark Elf females
are cute -and- they have a mischievious little expression as if they 
are always about to do something slightly "bad", like they have an
"attitude" and are always looking to play a trick on people. The Human
females are just plain pretty, like the girl next door. And the Erudite
females have a dark, exotic, far away mysterious beauty to them, soft,
understanding and patient, yet imbued with power. Even the Iksar females
have a certain attractiveness about them with their little web type 
thing atop their head. This is the impression I get from the models
we see and interact with now.
 
 The present models are nothing less than genius in my opinion. They
convey a message about the races you can feel just by looking at them.
The new models, from what I've seen, while looking quite nice really,
completely lack these attributes. They just don't do a thing for me.
 
 But they say that the new models aren't done yet so.... I will wait.
