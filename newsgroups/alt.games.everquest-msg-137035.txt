I'm not clear about the details of that case, myself.  As of the last
news item I read, the police felt it did not meat hate crimes
criteria.  I'm not sure if this is due to the discovery of some other
motive, or if the initial media reports had factual errors.

The incident does illustrate that, contrary to the beliefs of some,
the hate crimes designation is not given easily nor lightly as a
general rule.
