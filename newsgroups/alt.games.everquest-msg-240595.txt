Have i ever PA'd any plat or items? No I haven't. I just hold that it
isn't necessarily wrong to do so.

>Do you take this attitude to sports too?

Each and every sport takes this attitude towards equipment and gear
for their sport. Furthermore, each sport/league has a body which
licenses out goods to be manufactured. The problem arises in that Sony
wants to be the ONLY seller of equipment, and woe be you if you buy
the uniform from someone else to use who is leaving the game or wants
better.

You are wrong.. because you view the selling of characters and gear in
the light of a game play violation. You view it as its some technical
violation in that you dribbled wrong and what not, it isn't. Its
simply accumulating that which you need to play the game.. uniform,
ball, gear and being given the opportunity to play.

Tell that to all the players that buy in the bazaar.

Usually by 65th 100+AA a lot of your stuff has gone no drop. At the
same time, if you are say a bard, the gear you have isn't relavent for
say a Necro. Thing is.. by the time you reach 65th 100+AA you usually
have various ways of generating plat in game and can either sell that
to game sites or use it to fund twink gear for alts. A person who
reaches 65th 100AA though isn't typically going to make each alt from
scratch with doing the newb quests and no help. They usually use the
character they allready have to generate the plat for twink gear
and/or PL the alt. Would you consider this practice by established
players to also be illegal?

It can be done. Its impractical to get away with it.

Most timers on PoP god mobs are 30 minutes. You just presell the drops
RZTW can cough up with those buyers along as members of your guild for
the raid. Whichever of the drops drop.. grats Customer X who was next
up for XXX and who has allready deposited money for the item in the
guild leaders paypal account.

People allready pay in certain circumstances the right to be able to
loot something. From Creeping Silk Strands when pop first came out for
the gate neck to a ME shard. Whether or not they can resell it, a lot
of people would be willing to pay for the right to loot a no drop item
they've been craving for so they don't have to put in the work if they
could. And that imo, is where I would agree it would be wrong. I just
don't see why when Everquest allready has facilities in the bazaar
specifically for selling droppable items between other players, that
doing the same thing on a game site for real cash is wrong. Other than
Sony stomping their little foot at the injustice of someone else
getting a cut. The item still gets transferred, a price is still paid,
its the same thing.
