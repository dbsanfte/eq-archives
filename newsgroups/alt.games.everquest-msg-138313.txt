}Hi  all can any one explain the use of a mana battery and could i use one
}being a beastlord  thanks

Class one through four mana batteries have no known use.  Class 5 is a 
tinkering ingredient formaking or recharging certain uber tinkering 
devices - the watchman armor or the gnomish vanishing device.

This makes it pretty useless to a beastlord.  Support your local gnome! 
(So he can see over the counter...)

'Mana Battery' is also sometimes used to mean an enchanter, bard, or 
necro, and they are used by asking them for clarity, manasong, or a good 
twitch.  Say please. :)

There is apparently such a reference in this thread, along with a 
bastardization of my surname:

  Veeshan roasts Enchanter, and pulls out some 
  fava beans and a nice bottle of Kianti.
