Yes, I heal with my necro occasionally if necessary and try to balance it
out with taps/leach, but the Rapacious Subversion is a little beyond me.
Using 200 mana to add only 60 to another seems like a horribly inefficient
waste of mana.  Of course I'm probably wrong as I've never had a necro above
lvl 26.  I'm assuming that you generally have some kind of clarity as well
as some kind of hp to mana effect on to make it less painful.
