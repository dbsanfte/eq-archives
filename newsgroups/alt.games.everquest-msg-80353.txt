About as much as mentioning sex or that someone is "white" as in "white

We (The U.S.) wer recently attacked by people of the Muslim faith. I
don't think its unreasonable to ask if it was another Muslim that
killed those people.

I'm just wondering if he's another Islamic fundamentalist who wants to
