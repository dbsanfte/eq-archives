I think you missed the point of my post.  I'm pretty aware how it works. 
  The CD's are useless because they're printed before the expansion is 
complete, in order to be released at the same time as the digital 
download.  This time, they haven't been printed yet, the digital 
download is already out, and is already being fixed.  Next year they'll 
released an EQ box set with at least TSS in it and will push the 
advertising for it, making sure people know that it's for everyone from 
level 1 to level 75, that it's a complete game in and off itself, you 
don't need any other part of EQ to play it and enjoy the content.

That's their intent.  The cynical among us would suggest they didn't 
released a CD version so that they could spend another 3 months fixing 
the inevitable broken elements, so when they do release the CD version 
it's in a much better state for newbie (as in, never played EQ before) 
consumption.
