How assured are you that this isn't just another "Alchemy is working as
intended" scenario.  SOE is good at those.  Not finding out about
quest starts or middles or even being able to get the parts to do the
quest since the drops needed didn't make it live even though the
quest may have.  In many ways abscence of evidence *is* evidence of abscence
when it comes to SOE product.
