As a matter of fact, yes.   My rogue's gear is currently absolute crap,
since when she started it was as a twink.

She didn't become my main character until after I quit the game completely
and then returned in September of this year.  The only "good" items she has
were transferred over from my warrior's few droppables (who has been played
a total of once since I came back, when a friend had nobody to tank
Ragefire.) or purchased cheaply in the bazaar.  Her best item is a Vengence
II mask purchased with LDoN points. Worst item that she still wears is her
bracer slot, which is either a Myrkolar bracer or Ry'gorr chain bracer,
depending on what mood I'm in that day.

And my rogue, now being my main character, does not roll on warrior items
against the other members of the group.
