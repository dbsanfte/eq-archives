When was the last time you played a roleplaying game where none of the 
characters could talk and instead had to type their messages out to 
eachother. If you ever were to play such a game I'm sure your characters 
would rapidly evolve various shorthand. Oh wait... you do... its called 
EQ... and hmmm.... yes... there's the shorthand.

/shrug

When I play with my brother we use a headset, and we talk. I don't say 
"el oh el" or "gee-to-gee" or "oh oh em". But when its down to typing... 
you look for the most efficient means to communicate.

Plus when was the last time you played an RPG where the *only* thing to 
do in a dungeon was in fact to the pull the next mob?

Hey whats under that rock?
Nevermind... I can't seem to interact with it. 

How does the wall feel to the touch?
Nevermind... I can't seem to interact with it.

Can I take a leaf off this plant?
Nevermind... I can't seem to interact with it.

Has anyone ever trid talking to the Sand Geomancers?
Nevermind... Add, btw.
