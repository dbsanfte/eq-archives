    No, they're further up the hill and won't aggro on you at zone unless
some dimwit has trained them there. When my guild wiped to TT as I was
running there to join them (they obviously needed me to win, /chuckle) I was
able to stay in the graveyard/zone-in area and wait for the bodies to come
raining down to res them without incident. And the two baddies you're
describing were up.

    I'll describe the zone, and you'll get an idea why that isn't so hot an
idea.

    The zone-in to Nightmare B (The Lair of Terris Thule) is a bit further
along the zone wall that you followed to get to the start of the hedge maze
event. It's guarded by two big skeletal warrior-types. Killing those
skeletal warriors should give you an idea of the difficulty of the first
mobs in NightB. It is a separate zone.

    NightB itself is just one long, winding gully that leads to an arena
where Terris Thule is. As you progress along the gully, you run into pairs
of skeletal warriors and/or skeletal knights (skeletal warriors on skeletal
horses, these look neat). There's nothing else in the zone. There's no
choice as to where to go - it's one long gully. Given how long it took a
raid to dispatch the gully mobs you might be able to XP on them, but I don't
remember any special drops or reason to kill them as opposed to, say, the
hobgoblins in Nightmare. You won't make it to Terris Thule without a raid
force, as the mobs do increase in difficulty as you progress towards the
arena (same models, different names, harder).
