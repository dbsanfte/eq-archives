We once had a druid in there that kept drawing aggro through
overnuking, and last night we had a guest druid that thought the idea
was to get exp and complained he did 5k nuking to one mob and we still
didn't get exp. We lectured him on the fine art of assist healing at
that point :) 
I managed to 'draw aggro' in a kind of interesting fashion last night
- the drake we were fighting gated without warning and started
summoning people. I'd debuffed him at the beginning of the fight, and
for some reason he summoned me first and I was promptly beaten to
death by three mobs while they proceeded to summon some more and kill
almost everyone. We had some bad luck with repops and such during CR
and ended up summoning the last handful of corpses. My timer was
running out, so I camped (completely) till someone was free to come to
zone in and rez me, but my timer expired anyway while I was offline.
