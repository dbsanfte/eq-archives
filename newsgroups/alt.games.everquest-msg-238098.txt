She was very clear that she had online affairs from the first 10 minutes you
knew her.  She was honest.

Nah.  No reason to feel bad.  You weren't that important in her life.  You
weren't even her ONLY *cyber lover*.  

>> I wasn't stalking her from zone to zone, or sending her lewd
>tells for cyber sex. >Suddenly, I was the second choice after Shayne.>She was
playing with Shayne, as usual.  

Once you *broke up with her*, DID you send her tells asking for sex?  Is that
part of the reason you are mad?  That she had found someone *new* once you
*dumped* her and no longer had time for you?

Sounds like HIM knew all about the cyber.  Hell, he could have been part of it.
 Couples do that you know.  At any rate he didn't seem surprised or outraged,
so I doubt you need to concern yourself any more with the possibility that you
hurt HIM.

I suppose it's good that you got all this out of your system.  Now you can move
on, right?
