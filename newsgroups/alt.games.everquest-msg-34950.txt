I've been wondering which areas I'm safe to explore where mobs are usually
high in number, dangerous, but use faction adjustments.  I've thought about
some of the following...

Frogloks - Can I explore any and all the way to the bottom of Guk since I've
never killed one of them and not have to worry about being KOS to anything?

Lizardmen - Don't they have faction too?  I think I remember lowering
faction with them as my Ogre.  Can I theoretically go into Temple of Cazik
Thule and walk past them without being attacked?  Or at least wonder past a
group without them wanting me for lunch or trying to make lunch out of me?

Ogres - I've seen and heard good races roaming in Oggok or Ferrott without
problem.  I've heard you're indifferent to merchants and only KOS to
bouncers.  Is this true?  What if I started killing merchants?  Do I get EXP
or much loot and faction hits against them?

These are only ones I can think of right now, but what about other races?
Anybody know of any others you're safe with until you kill a few (other than
Orcs, I doubt anybody reaches very high LV and isn't KOS to orcs or gnolls
by then).  Don't you start off non-KOS to bandits in Karana plains?

I'm LV 17 and thinking of good places to hunt (might have to solo due to
time I'm able to log on) that also give decent amount of money (or good
sellable loot that doesn't weigh too much).
