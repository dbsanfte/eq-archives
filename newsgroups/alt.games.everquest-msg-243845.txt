You took a viewpoint you admitted you didn't actually agree with
specifically to annoy people with bullshit arguments supporting what
is acknowledged to be *cheating* along with many demonstrations of why
it's bad.

That kind of intellectual bullshit is very annoying.

You were trying to defend an argument that you knew many people had
strong opinions about, and then tried to pass it off as vapid
ponderings. Either stop or accept you face responses you would deserve
if you really believed the crap you're spewing.

There are few things more annoying than a self proclaimed "devil's
advocate" doing his best to goad people by using arguments they know
are morally reprehensible.
