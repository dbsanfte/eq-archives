We've died to Ail (thinks for a second) only once i think, maybe 2 or 3
times that i don't recall.
Never ever wiped on the guardians or Tunare though.

Its usually something stupid, like the bard messes up and all clerics end up
silenced.

New ST was a blessing for you guys, then!
We were pretty much done with ST by revamp-time, going from 1 primal per
raid to 15primals per raid sure speeds the process, tho

I disagree.  Just 1 warrior over level 60 boosts your chances.  Just 1
cleric with virtue, 1 shaman with new sta/focus means your tanks all have a
lot more HP.  Just 1 enchanter with SoV means your whole raid has a much
higher dps.

You class Vyemm as a CH chain mob?

A 40 person flawless aow kill 6 months ago would be a pretty impressive
achievement, imo.

Heck I remember Bens "MA for a flawless AOW kill" sig, and they may well
have had a lot more than 40 people present (I forget exactly, but I think he
said 75? people were present for their first aow slaying)
