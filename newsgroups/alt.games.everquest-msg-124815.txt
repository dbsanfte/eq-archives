Human.

Seeing the racial intolerance that the minority races in the known RL
zone have to deal with, I can't imagine what sort of bullshit a complete
alien or medieval monstrosity would have to put up with. Trolls are cool
in Velious.  In Georgia I think "ah'd be a lynched afore sundown, ya fat
freak".

"Strange Eight Foot Tall Creature Found Dead in Picklesville"

"Authorities report that a bizarre, mishappen eight foot tall creature
was discovered off of dew claw road, approximately two miles from State
Route 17 this morning. The creature was clad in medival looking, heavy
metal armor, carrying several huge, edged weapons of unknown origin, and
was estimated to weigh in excess of 800 pounds.  Said Sherrif Billy Bob
Ray Carter, 'The dang thing had seventeen bullet holes in it, twentafore
stab wounds in vahrious entree points, en had heavy tarre irun chains
wrapped all ovah it! Head was dang neah crushed in bah sum heavy blunt
object ah sum kand.  Dang! Worse damned case a suicide ah ever did see.'

Authorities have no leads or suspects in the case at this time."
