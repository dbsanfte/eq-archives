  I personally think that pets do equip shields and armor (the
Elemental Defender can also be worn on your back, by the way) and that
they do benefit from it.

  There is at least one summoned item (the Muzzle of Mardu) that we
know is specifically intended to be given to pets, so I don't see any
reason to doubt that they benefit from other equipment given to them.
