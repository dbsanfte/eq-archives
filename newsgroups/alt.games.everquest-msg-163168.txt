I am still laughing about that but I guess Volounteer Guides don't 
(or perhaps they laugh at me too ;-P)

I was camping an orc camp in the WC with my all new chanter, the 
first one I have ever played (and that I begin to really love).
I usually have been playing druid, ranger, bard, magicians, 
halflings rogues...

Suddenly after a train so well handled, begging my group for a 
medtime, I sit on my ass and start making some silk bandages with 
spider silks looted then start playing Gems, waiting my mana to 
raise.
After one Gems' level, I look at my mana and HP bars and see they 
have not raised at all!!!! And I got a terrific agi/dex malus!
I look at my buffs: no debuff that I would have not noticed before.
I stand up, move a little then sit again, ask a fellow for a heal
-> nothing, my bars are still both stuck at less then 20%.

Hmmm.... what is this buggy affair? I thought...
Quick log off then log in: same.
Complete camp, reboot, launching EQ again -> nothing.
I did not want to start reinstall EQ for this, so I send a 
/petition.
5 minutes later a Guide send me a tell, asking for details.
He take his time to think about that, then send a reply explaining 
that I was probably out of food and out of drink since a too long 
time.

Ho.... :-S
Then these annoying "Out of food" and "Out of drink" messages 
weren't useless???

Now I am not a newbie anymore.... I am a Man :)))


Conclusion: never take a GUI skin where the player window does not 
show your stamina bar. :P
