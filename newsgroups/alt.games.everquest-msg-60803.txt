First of all, I'm a newbie, too. But let me give you some advice:

1. If you're having trouble grouping, create a new character based in Freeport.
Then, when he's at least level 4 or 5, go to Northen Ro or the East Commonlands
and find the Bazaar in the tunnel; you can usually find people there to group
with.

2. Pick a class that can solo well. Druids or Necromancers are great at
soloing.

I play a Necromancer. I've only been playing for a little over a week, and I'm
almost level 9, without any powerleveling.
I've only grouped about three or four times, however.

If you play a Necromancer in Freeport, there is a price; you're KOS in North
Freeport, which means you can't use the bank; my Necro has to carry everything
on him.

I've died about six times so far (twice in a group, where we all got wiped
out), and actually had to have help recovering my corpse twice. (Once it was in
the Nektulos Forest river, which has piranhas in it, the other was in the
middle of an Orc Camp, and I hadn't reached lvl 8, so I couldn't become
invisible yet)
