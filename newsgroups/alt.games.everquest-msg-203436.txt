You are thinking about it wrong. It is your account which is enabled
or not enabled for logging in and all content. So your friend can only
go to expansion zones if he registered them on his account as well,
with the codes so he was expansion enabled.

Yes, if you only have base game on a friend's pc then you log
in with your account it will possibly DL some expansion content. It
will only do this if he has the patcher enabled for the other
expansions, which he probably doesn't if he only has the base game.

What would happen is that it would start trying to DL epansion stuff
then say "Download limit exceeded."
