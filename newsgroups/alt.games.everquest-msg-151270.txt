It always amazes me too, but I can think of at least 3
ways someone could reasonably never see a given patch message
in the first place:

1.  They haven't played since before the patch-before-last
(thus when they start the game, they'll see the most recent
patch message, but not the one prior to it).

2.  Two or more people in their household share an EQ
computer.  e.g. Bill logs on after the patch and gets to
see the patch message, then later his brother Bob logs
on (to his own account) and the patch message doesn't
show (since it only pops up once).

3.  They first started playing the game after the given
patch.

But yeah, each of these should be uncommon enough that
it hardly explains the seemingly 3,333 people who
appear bewildered about a recent patch.
