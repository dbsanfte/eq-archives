BL epic is a H2H weapon, so I would suggest you keep the skill up. At
your level I would recommend a couple of Polished Steel Ulaks (9/27
H2H magical with some nice stat bonuses).  It is a common drop in
Dawnshroud Peaks, and is about the best H2H weapon available until you
hit your 50s unless you have a LOT of pp to burn. @50-150pp each
depending on server.

Also look for an Embalmers Skinning Knife from the Tower of Frozen
Shadow in Velious. This is a dagger that processes the "Summon
Banadages" spell durring combat. It is a great money saver when it
comes to working on bind wound, and helps to reduce downtime.
@200-300pp depending on server,

Another nice piercer is the Slime Coated Harpoon (10/22 magic).
@500-700pp depending on server.
