I have been studying lately and haven't had much time to do anything outside
of tradeskilling but here's my observation so far and I'd love to hear
others POV.

I find the nested boxes/bags fantastic, although i haven't nested boxes yet
so i don't know if you can actually walk if you do that. I loathed zoning
and running about everytime i made a box and so far this works flawlessly. 3
cheers for SOE!

I don't like the changes to the fuel costs. Tradeskilling went from
something where i could sort of break even selling back to the merchant to
something where i'll have to sell to other players, and there's a heck of a
lot of people selling the same as me. So it looks like i'll have to
adventure to cover the cost of tradeskilling. Argh, tradeskilling as a
moneysink. This is one of the reasons EQ2 was saying it was better: the
artisan is supposed to be a viable choice. Maybe it is if you can have an
alt merchant on another account, but so far i have seen a lot of depressing
things that look like sales below cost price, presumably as the items were
used as skillups and they can't be sold to npc now.

Perhpas the attuneable bit will mean people will buy my forged iron
chainmail, but considering questable stuff is easy to get and you get xp in
the process, it's hard for me to sell what i can make. The money/time ratio
for tradeskillign so far is poor and seems to have slipped into the
negative. Perhaps there are exploits i'm missing. If i could find rares for
my sage, perhaps i would sing a different tune. None so far.

I have also heard the pally horse now walks. I haven't tested it and i am
hoping that's false, but frankly, they should have used a burro as the
steed. I have ridden on horses and the usual impression is
"whee!",
     "stop now please!"
        "Argh that's barbed wire"
            "I told you you couldn't jump it".

I can rollerskate faster than a pally horse. Perhaps gnomes could invent the
pushbike.

The con bit i saw once and it looked nice and i haven't yet heard one of the
new voices. I am unlikely to own a house pet as frankly i'd want one that
can feed itself. There's rats everywhere, isn't there? And, if you have a
baby dragon, lots of sheep and deer for shiny scales and a healthy internal
hearth.
