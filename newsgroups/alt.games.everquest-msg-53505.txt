    R.I.P. dwarves and troll. He's usually fear kited around for a reason,
and given he's yellow to Tiru I can't see Invoke Fear landing often enough
to save you a fate most unkind. On the plus side, if you level up your
necromancer enough you can solo him!

    I admire the spirit you showed trying a second time. But he's level 50 -
maybe the only level 50 in game that doesn't summon people. Level 50
old-world mobs are nasty.

    Widowmistress, Aliezewsaur.... you've been hitting all the old-world
nasties, haven't you? Welcome back. 8)
