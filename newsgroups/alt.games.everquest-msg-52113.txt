Different strokes for different folks I guess.  Obviously I've done a little
hack, slash, loot, if I made it to 39 somehow.  Honestly I don't get any
more pleasure from taking down a Sarnak knight at 39 than I did taking down
an orc warrior at 7.  However I must admit it's now a lot of fun to run over
and "Break the spawn" at the orc camps when people ask for it to be done.
Call me materialistic but I've always been more intrigued by the many items,
weapons, and pieces of equipment in the game.  I think the most I've ever
had on me at one time is about 500pp up to this point.  I'd always save up a
bit and go buy myself something new.  Last night I made 900pp in two hours
for sitting on my butt and trading things.  I've got another item in my
inventory (Sword of Skyfire) that I'll probably sell tonight for a 600-900
profit. I'm enjoying this because for onceI don't have to worry about corpse
runs, where I'm bound, how much more experience do I have to get before I
can quit for the night, should I leave the group, should I join another
group, etc.. etc.. etc.

If I get tired of trading I'll probably take my many thousand platinum
pieces, suite up, and go back to fighting (with much better equipment) as I
did before.   Right now I'm getting a real kick out of seeing all these
items and taking them for a short test spin before selling them again for a
profit.

I've always wanted really cool weapons and equipment and now I can make that
happen.  I learned that I can either sit around wishing, or do something
about it.
