I do think he's right, though.  If I get a personal tell, I will say 'yes' 
or 'no'.  End of transaction.  If I see something in /ooc, I feel a bit 
weird sending a /tell saying 'sorry, wish I could help you, but I can't', 
since I wasn't directly asked.  Even when I'm the only <x> in the zone 
that can help them.  Net result is, I tend to see the /ooc request about 8 
times before I finally say 'look, dude, that's not gonna work.'  After 
all, it's usualy not until the 4th one or so when I start doing a /who to 
see if there's someone else who would help them... And in the meantime, 
this poor guy, who probably did a /who right off, has spent the better 
part of half an hour wondering if I'm blind or just mean or what, when he 
could be moving on to the next zone, that might have -two- <x>'s in it.
