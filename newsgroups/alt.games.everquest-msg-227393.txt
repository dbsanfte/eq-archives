On No Drop gear, NBG is pretty much the only game in town, although on 
Firiona Vie there's not much No Drop, even the augments aren't quite no 
drop; that is to say, they are, but you can put them on items and then 
sell the items in trader mode; so they can be used on other people's 
droppable gear.

Also, it helps that the augments are pretty common and (thus far at 
least) don't do anything but give you some stat or other; stats really 
aren't all that important to the game by and large, and any given one is 
really probably only of use to one or two people in a given group.

Splendid
