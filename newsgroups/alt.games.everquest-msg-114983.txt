Here is the proper way to make a valid argument, both to help those of you
who don't know any better, and as a general flame to the morons out there.

1. Have valid premises. (if you can't do this, then your argument is flawed
right off the ground)

2. Avoid using fallacies in arguing.

    Here is a list of fallacies most common (IMHO) on Usenet (in no
particular order) (full list of fallacies available at
http://gncurtis.home.texas.net/ )

    1) Accident - E.G. Birds normally fly; Tweety the penguin is a bird;
therefore, Tweety can fly - using a broad definition, and applying it to an
exception to the definition.

    1a) Converse Accident (more common IMO) - E.G. a_dr00d_73 refused to
port me, he was an ass, therefore all druids are assholes - Hasty
generalization, if one sample of a group displays a particular quality, then
the entire group must display that quality

    2) Argument from Force - E.G. I can kick your ass so what I say is
true. - using force or the threat of force to argue for your point.

    3) Loaded Questions - E.G. Have you stopped beating your wife yet? -
asking a question that presupposes a false premise.

    4) Straw Man (seen people getting accused of this a lot recently) - E.G.
Charles Manson was a monster who desecrated his victims after killing them,
therefore anyone who kills is a monster - Attacking the extremes of a
position as argument against a moderate stance on the position.

    5) Begging the Question - (no example I can think of that would make
easy sense) - Stating the conclusion of an argument, as a valid premise.

    6) Argument Ad Hominem ("against the man", big one here) - E.G. EQ is
not a difficult game, you're just a moron - Using personal attacks against
whomever makes a statement as an argument against the statement.

And now for the obligatory pointless server board copy and paste.

THX LOGIC SIR!
