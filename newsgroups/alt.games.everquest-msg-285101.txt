Because in TSS and in the Tutorial there are quests which teach people 
how to play the game, how to progress, what they need to do, and run 
them through learning what EQ is about.

Much as you get in WoW, EQ2, and any recent MMORPG's.  EQ1 was missing 
that until the last incarnation of the tutorial, and for starting 
characters who want content they can do at a low level on their own and 
learn how to play their class, TSS can't be beaten.

They want TSS+Base EQ to be an expansion NEW players buy that allows 
them to get into EQ quickly and enjoy the game even if they don't know 
30 other people yet.

Why send people to old zones with hardly any content that teaches them 
nothing about their class and makes the game 'hard to get into' compared 
to the other games on the market?
