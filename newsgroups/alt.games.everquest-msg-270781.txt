That's a great question. I always thought Bards were a very cool class 
but I was put off by the idea of twisting. I never considered playing 
one for that reason. I mean, the fact that you can keep four songs up is 
very cool but the way you had to do it sucked in my opinion from what 
I'd read about it. So rolling a Bard is kinda tempting now. I love how 
fast they move. I know that's just one little thing they can do but I 
really love that. I like how they have so much to offer a group and are 
capable soloers too.

I have a 65 Cleric that is my main and four baby alts I've twinked out a 
bit to get them off to a good start, a Druid, Beastlord, Enchanter and 
Warrior. I'm one of those people who wants to play a lot of classes as I 
like a good number of them and think they'd be fun to play all the way 
up to the high end game. As if the four I already have aren't enough I'd 
really like trying out a Shammy, Necro and Mage too.

I have a feeling I am going to still be playing EverQuest when the last 
server goes down. LOL!! For me, it's the best and most fun gaming 
experience I've ever had. And my experience goes all the way back to 
running Flight Simulator on a PC-XT with a Hercules card on a monochrome 
monitor.
