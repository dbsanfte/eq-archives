I have many times seen the Mortificiers reanimate a cadaver that's been
"killed".  

In this case however we're talking about the Mortificier who died,
leaving only cadavers, who don't do reanimation. 

It's _exactly_ the same thing Bob was talking about, a dead mob that
spontaneously came alive again.

Yep, that's my main reason for always targeting the "healers" first, it
gets damn annoying to have to kill the same cadaver multiple times.
Not to mention that the damn dartgun poison is a serious pain, what with
the slow regen effect.
