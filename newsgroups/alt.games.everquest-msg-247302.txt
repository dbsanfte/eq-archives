A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the

I agree. Well actually I didn't mind maps, it was just the little
arrow that showed where you were that was the problem. Maps themselves
are fine.

I think Davian put this point better. It's the rampant and extreme
mudflation with every expansion that put a bullet in this, and many
other things.

I agree. I still hate what PoK did to the game (and before some chimp
says "so don't use it" I am referring to what it did to attitudes and
gameplay as a whole, not just to me). And again I agree with Davian
that there are too many keyed places. Places restricted by "if you go
in at your level you're certain to die" would have been a much better
idea.

They dumbed it down at every opportunity and let the rampant
mudflation go out of control to the point that now there are zonewide
debuffs just to knock back the players who have maxed every
conceivable number on their characters. This also blurred class
destinctions and led to more and more classes wondering if they have
any role at all.

And the people who are calling this post a troll need to go smell the
wind one of these days; James' viewpoint is a lot more valid and
widespread than you think.
