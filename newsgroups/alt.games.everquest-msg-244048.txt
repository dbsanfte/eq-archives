Two different computers work fine here. That's not counting about 5
friends locally who all play EQ on their own computers. Plus about a
dozen more computers at a local 'net cafe (all different
configurations. Kind of a patchwork startup small business), where
customers play EQ regularly. Haven't heard a single complaint about
the Bazaar from any of them since the patch.
