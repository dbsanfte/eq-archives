I have it hooked to a separate key than evade, since I don't alway want 
to evade as often as I PP.  My third hotkey is attack off, pickpocket, 
attack on, sense heading, sense traps.  I had ID in there for awhile 
too, but now that it actually works, it could be very very bad, so I 
leave that practice until I'm farming greens or practicing lockpicking 
in Befallen. ;p
