Clerics are ludicrously overpowered.

Clerics are ridiculously underpowered.

Without explaination, without details, I can't see what meaning you can attach to
those two statements, except I suppose to decide that clerics must be balanced.

Clerics are overpowered in very limited circumstances; they are far and away the
best healers when you really really need healing.

Clerics are underpowered in any circumstances where you don't really really need
healing; most mobs, when slowed by high end slowers become so wimpy that much
less effective healers are more than capable of keeping up.  Clerics bring
nothing interesting to the table, by and large, other than massive heals.

Clerics are remarkably poor soloers, in terms of either exp per hour or mobs per
hour or high powered mob killing.  There -are- worse soloers in the game, and I
soloed at least half of each level from 44 to 60, so it -can- be done (untwinked,
this is my main and I didn't get a bunch of free goodies from friends either)

I believe that no, clerics are indeed currently underpowered on the whole, but I
don't think its meaningful to oversimplify things to that level.
