This behavior is new to me, I haven't seen anything like it, either from 
years of playing nor currently.

But I can think of something I've seen that resembles it... are you sure 
the monk was charmed and not feared?  Feared he might run in practically 
any direction, and the mobs would follow him.

Later, a mob may have charmed him; while a little odd, this feared and 
then charmed behavior would mean he'd run with mobs to you, then the 
mobs would stop chasing him and attack you, while he stopped running and 
attacked you as well.

Barring this, well, its disturbing, because when charmed the PC 
basically becomes a mob, and has no way of knowing who is in his group 
and who isn't and should be using a form of aggro similar to that all 
other mobs use.  This would represent a radical change.  Not necessarily 
an illogical change, but its not the way its always worked in the past, 
so we'd have to think about what it might mean in terms of changes in 
approach...
