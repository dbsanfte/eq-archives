Are you sure about that?  If travel wasn't trivialized, I would think
many people would be more likely to hunt in nearby level appropriate
zones, rather than travel 50 minutes in order to get better experience
and loot in a crowded zone.

I'm not entirely sure why SOE allows obvious xp/loot imbalances between
zones.  My only guess is they do it on purpose in order to help convince
people to buy new expansions.  You know, spend $30 and get much better
xp and loot.

Yeah...  :(  But places like Paludal Caverns sells expansions...
