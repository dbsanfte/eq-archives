It would take a lot of boring exp grinding, but it could probably be done. I
levelled my shaman by soloing from 40-50 in about 5 weeks playing casually
about 20-25 hours per week with about 3/4 of the time spent exp grinding.
Each level took about 8-10 hours including some travel time.  Soloing would
be the way to go.  You might want to invest in some peridots and paying a
cleric for Aego if you can find it.  Of course it also depends on the kind
of gear you had, mine is nothing special.
