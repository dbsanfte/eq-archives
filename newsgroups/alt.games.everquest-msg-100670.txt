Sure it is. You're the one making 'fuzzy' statements, like "it takes
too long for Verant CS to respond to customer concerns" and "Too many
busy signals when calling a CS phone number"

We can (and have) demonstrate that one thing that's changing is the
cost of doing business. Surely you don't expect them to run at a loss?
Their costs go up, and that gets passed on to the customer. Just like
any business.

And as for what improvements might be implemented, you're saying "the
only thing that's changing", but you don't actually have any idea what
is changing - you are making assumptions.

You're talking about two different things there. The cost of
developing the expansions is not the same as the increased cost of
operations after they are developed.
