 Well let's see... I used taunt everytime it became available and it
never went up. At level 10 I trained one point in it at the SK guild and
it started to go up. Coincidence? I think not. Read any class page
regarding the taunting skill and it will tell you that you need to train
one point. Are all these sources wrong? I doubt it.
