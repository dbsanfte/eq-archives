When I used to play a 53 cleric i meleed ALOT, when I needed a break from
sitting and medding 90% of fights I went soloing and fear kited (clinging
darkness at lvl 53 sucks btw lol), was very frustrating at times since my
melee was so poor but it was a nice change from the usual cleric role (that
and it made people's heads turn lol).
When I fear kited with my cleric I found it very mana efficient and a ton of
fun, mabey it wasn't the fastest way for me to exp but it was a nice change
of pace.... i'm sure I'm not the only cleric who enjoyed soloing a bit in
the upper levels and having a decent melee cap would have made it more
enjoyable.
