It's called /help.  I don't help anyone unless they yell for help because
I've jumped in too many times to help people out only to find out that they
had the situation entirely under control (or at least thought they did,
there have been a couple of times when I jumped in to help, the dude yells
at me for trying to "steal his kill", I back off, and 30 seconds later he
dies)
