Please understand I was just using the provision of material objects as an
example.  Advice, suggestions and a chat while you're resting is just as
welcome, this can also be especially welcome while you're crafting things in
AC2.  I have NEVER begged, or even asked for weapons/armour etc, if somebody
offers it then fine.

Patches/content are updated monthly is AC2.  This wouldn't be so bad if the
servers were down for that amount of time.

Sounds good to me.

I suppose it's because I find it difficult to mix with others in real life
and it seems to spill into my gaming exploits as well.  I know that nobody
knows who you are, but I just find it difficult to socialize. A bit of a
recluse I suppose you could say.  I would love to be part of a raid, but
it's all about getting to know the people your with, and that's the part
that's difficult for me.  Sorry to babble, but I'm desperate to feel a part
of something, and was so hoping that MMORPG's would help me.  That's why I
bought AC2, but find that I can't because the servers seem to be down when I
want to play.
