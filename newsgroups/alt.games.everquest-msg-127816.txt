The original thread was a complaint about one player, whose guild had
tried to KS Venril Sathir, sending several tells to the player who had
been camping at the Venril Sathir spawn site.  (GM intervened and they
both got a stone since Venril always drops two stones).  The player
who had been part of the attempted KS group apparently didn't know who
to give the stone to or what else he needed to do and kept sending the
one who had been camping tells about what to do.  

I'd have told the other player to look it up outside the game.
Obviously the player sending Tells wasn't interested in interacting
with the NPCs and his tells would be annoying me.  How exactly are
Tells to someone more immersing than interacting with the NPCs
involved? How are Tells or more immersive than reading what you have
to do and then doing it?  I'm sure your game experience is improved
and made more immersive by the unknown player whose guild tried to KS
you asking in tells "Who do I give this to?  What else do I need?
Where do I get it?" while you are trying to play.
