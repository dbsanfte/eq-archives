Diablo 2 does this admirably, as did Asheron's Call.

And if you look at their strategy for doing it, its not even that
memory intensive. four to five numbers to an item instead of just one.

Basically imagine a base weapon with a few augment slots except augs
are randomly rolled and inserted prior to the player getting the
weapon. They can even have a few extra un-filled aug slots for further
customization... a la Diablo 2 socketed rares... and that leaves open
the possibily for Diablo 2 style rune word items... hmmmm... now I'm
really looking forward to WoW =)
