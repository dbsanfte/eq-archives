Not that it's really important, but I didn't say I went there with a Warrior
and a Wizard.  My friend was playing his Warrior, I was playing a Rogue and
we had a Druid and two others with us (a Ranger and one other I don't
remember)  What I said was that he used to go there with his Wizard who is
now level 52.  He said he spent a lot of time there levelling his Wizard and
thought we would do well in the zone.  After our dismal experience there, he
figured that a caster would do better there.

If it's working for you why change.  M Saru is kinda boring.  I only went
there because it was fast easy exp. It's also really easy to get there when
you don't have a lot of time to play.
