Here is how I PL'ed my Ogre warrior with a 58 shaman

1 - 10 Crushbone - usually empty except for TR and lots of stuff that is red
10 - 20 PC  fiends
20 - 25 PC B2 just solo'ed the places for fast xp
25 - 30 Splitpaw
30 - 40 HG's for cash since it is usually empty on my server (by empty I
mean less than 10 people)
40 - 50 DL

The only problem with that, is you see dick for content. Which is fine if
you are PL'ing yourself or another player. So you may want to use any place
that has low reds for each level and use EQ Atlas to find a zone that works
and do something different. I got to level 50 in just under 2 days played
and had all skills except h-2-h and 2hb maxed (admittedly I spent ALL my
training points) (cant seem to find a good 2hb for what I would consider
spending on a twink)
