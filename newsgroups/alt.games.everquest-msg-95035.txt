Aye, but Verant has been playing close attention to the druid bashers
lately. Your list of druid abilities :
Port -> not in Luclin, anywhere
SoW -> Jboots and Improved Run Speed
Camo -> Whoopee, most casters can cast it, most high level area MOBs can see
it
Wolf Form -> KoS almost everywhere, only possible outside
DS and DoT -> Still very nice for soloing and small groups. Pretty useless
in raids

Shamans Dots are better, I undersatnd that Bear form is accepted most places
Wolf form is not. They have regen as well, and their ability to buff,
non-stackable with Druids, makes druid buffs pale.

Anyway, I play a druid and I love the class, but I wish Verant would make
them just a little more useful in groups. I try to let the bashing roll off
me, but sometimes it starts to wear on me. Just an example from my log
file - shortly after zoning into  CS to help a friend kill Sirens for his
Shawl quest.

[Fri Mar 08 11:02:32 2002] PLAYER1 says out of character, 'can anyone sow me
plz....will come to u'
[Fri Mar 08 11:02:51 2002] You begin tracking PLAYER1.

[Fri Mar 08 11:03:14 2002] You begin casting Spirit of Wolf.

[Fri Mar 08 11:03:18 2002] PLAYER1 is surrounded by a brief lupine aura.
[Fri Mar 08 11:03:25 2002] You bow before PLAYER1.
[Fri Mar 08 11:03:26 2002] PLAYER1 tells you, 'thanks alot'
[Fri Mar 08 11:03:28 2002] PLAYER1 bows before ME.
[Fri Mar 08 11:03:29 2002] You say, 'Good hunting )'

[Fri Mar 08 11:06:44 2002] PLAYER2 says out of character, 'i hate hate hate
f****n quad kiters.  come collect you trash!'
[Fri Mar 08 11:06:57 2002] PLAYER1 says out of character, 'u tell em
PLAYER1'

I edited the names to player1 and player2, and the explicative was as well.

Player2 was a 60th level warrior camping Wyverns. He was killing things WAY
faster than any druid. I doubt he would have appreciated anyone walking into
HIS camp and grabbing one of HIS Wyverns - even if he happened to be single
melee'ing another one at the time. Player1 was a real jewel. Was probably
ported in, begs for SoW, and 3 minutes later is agreeing with this vulgar
idiot.
