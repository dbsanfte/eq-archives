It wouldnt surprise me if they have reduced the level of support on the
normal servers. Last night I sent in a petition for the lvl 19,24 druid
spell vendor (only one) to be reset. It was about 8 hours before I got a
reply. I didnt see any gm's or guides logged on in the meantime. This would
have been between about 1am and 9am pacific time. Graveyard shift for sure,
but im surprised that there isnt just 1 gm doing the rounds through the
servers attending to the simple problems (like mine)
