I remember reading that there was a 50% xp penalty for "high greens" and 75%
penalty for "low greens". I certainly hope you ar right and I am wrong now,
cos it means I can quad kite light blues for my special skills at 56. Bit
hard to find quaddable dark blues at 56. Gonna try this out, and since I can
actually see my special xp move with each kill, it should be easy enough to
tell if theres any penalty.
