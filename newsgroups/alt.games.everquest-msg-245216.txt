It is a weakness due to having the name Monk(Martial Artist) attached to the
class.  Watch any of the Ultimate Fighting competitions and you can see for
yourself that a skilled Martial Artist has many more tools at their disposal
than just punching and kicking.  Rogues get the unique ability of
Backstabbing.  Warriors get the unique ability of having the highest Hit
Points, Mitigate Damage the best and go Defensive at higher levels.  All of
these have direct effects against a mob.  The only tool Monks bring is the
passive ability of FD and the token lull that they gave the class recently
in hopes of shutting up the dissatisfied players.  Monks get really nothing
in their tool box that is uniquely theirs that is detrimental to a mob.
