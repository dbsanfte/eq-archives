I don't even think there is even an internet cafe in the whole town.  I've 
never seen or heard of one.  If you must get some internet time in and 
don't necessarily need to use your own computer to do it, you can use the 
library computers.  Central library has a fairly newly remodeled computer 
room that has brand new computers.
