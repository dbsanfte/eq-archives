Next thing you'll want is Virtue in a bottle, and Focus of Soul too.  Try
playing your character without KEI you might be surprised what you can
accomplish.  Or if you can't live without it, get another account and
powerlevel up a pocket chanter.  I've gone without kei plenty of times, and
my husband plays a 65 enchanter.  Just sometimes he isn't on at the same
time as me, or is knee deep in OoW or some other zone.  Just for the record
shamans do make FT potions.

Sure the game is easier with KEI but it can be done without.  And with
beastlords and druids you can get some form of mana regen, and there is
tribute as well.
