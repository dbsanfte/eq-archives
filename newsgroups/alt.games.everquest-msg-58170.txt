The problem with this at higher levels is that you can nuke until OOM
and the critter often still isn't dead.

At level 52 my druid has about 2250 mana with 200 WIS and a smattering
of +Mana gear. After ensnaring that leaves enough for eight Starfires
IF there are no fizzles. IF Starfire lands for max damage of 612, 
that 612 x 8 == 4896 points.

That's not enough to kill a mid 40s mob like a tatterback gorilla or 
greater war bone or forest giant ancient. It is enough to kill a low 
blue like a moldering gorilla or forest giant verdant or wyvern -- 
IF you don't lose too much in partial or outright resists and fizzles.

I don't like all those IFs. Root/dot/med allows gives plenty 
enough breathing room to safely take on the higher blues.
