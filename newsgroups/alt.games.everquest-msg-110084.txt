No, because the law shouldn't bother with what is good or evil.  The
law should concern itself with what is best for the society and the
people in it.  And I think a fairly strong point can be made that it's
BAD for a society to let people run around the streets killing each
other at random.

To be honest, I don't think an all encompassing definition of evil
will ever work for everybody.

You realize that statement is probably going to get you flamed to holy

Personally, I think Osama is a douche bag.  But he (more than likely)
believes what he is doing is right. And he could probably give some
convincing arguments why he's doing it.  The US has dome shitty things
in that part of the world.  But that still, to my mind, doesn't
forgive what he did, but I'm hardly impartial.

Fine, but I think evil requires intent.  Otherwise tornadoes are evil.

I never said it couldn't be understood.  But rating things like
"hogging all the cookies" isn't even in the same ballpark as evil.
Hell, it isn't even playing the same SPORT as evil.

Ok, who decides what's too much self interest?

I'm sorry, but THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS did nothing for me.  THE LION,
THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE was pretty good though.  :-)
