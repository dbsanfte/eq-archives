How does the tradeskill system give incentive to using alts instead of
depending on other players, unless you mean by making it possible?  I
see a lot of trading of crafting components in the trader channel, but
I gave up on crafting at level 11 so I'm not really following it.

I haven't much seen this problem in my groups - most people will help
others with their quest mobs even if they don't need them themselves,
and will usually not drop immediately when they're done (there is
still exp and loot to be had, after all).  And rarely does anyone mind
inviting more people if it's needed.  There is a bit less socialising
in groups than in EQ, I think, probably because fighting is more
intense and there is very little downtime (something that WoW probably
also suffers from, though my experience there is limited to getting
two characters to level 4, solo), but on the whole it's not as bad as
you describe.  Maybe Runnyeye is better than wherever you played,
unless it was on Runnyeye, or maybe I'm just lucky, or maybe it's my
brilliant wit and charm. ;-)
