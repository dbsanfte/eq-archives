Yep, I agree. Putting the trivial code add on wide in Luclin is going
peeve so many people. Everyone does not want to twink 4 characters or
even not twink them per se just to enjoy the new areas.

I don't feel that it is that forced in DAOC. It seems like it will
more be on the borders of realms. One nice thing is that no matter
what your level you can participate, they purposely made it so relics
are on the borders of realms so even fairly low players could jump on
in and grab something. They did it that way so it would not just be
the uber players who could conquer a city who could get realm points.

yeah, I am so damn tired of all the Verant non equal content for the
uber people. Going to a fan faire 9 states away for a VIDEO GAME is
out of the means of your average player yet at such a fan faire at a
trivia contenst a player's character in the game can be given a
fantastic unique weapon. I think that everyone paying for a
subscription service, whether a video game or whatever, should be
treated EQUALLY in game. The only thing the "haves" who can go to the
fan faire should get is a chance to hang with Verant and see lil
previews or something but nothing added to the content of the game
they pay THE SAME rate I pay for. The titles you might get in EQ were
the same way, from some gm event or some happening.

I think SoL Will be more of the same, yet with much less reason to be
there due to the trvial combat code. The only new thing will be new
player models. Once again it is mimicking the bad form that the
velious armors had, actually FORCING your players to buy some 19
dollar add on just to see the new thing. Something seems immoral about
that. I mean I can understand the 19 bucks to go to the new areas but
not just some basic thing like a new look.

EQ is getting a bit long in the teeth for an add on to really pump
more life into it anyway, short of the whole game being rebuilt.
Making it an add on where trvial code limts that even more, is a huge
mistake by verant. Once again, I really doubt if the trivial code will
be mentioned on the box as a selling point. Some people are going to
be surprised and miffed.
