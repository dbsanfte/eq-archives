Yeah, I think it's probably encouraged. The Cazic Thule killed in PoF
is viewed by RPers as just an "avatar", and killing it only diminishes
CT's power temporarily until he can "reconstitute" himself. Overall,
I'd say CT and the other dark gods would want strong followers to
better stomp out those puny lightwalkers. They focus on raw power, I'd
say, and what better test of that power than against his own personal
guardians and his very avatar?
