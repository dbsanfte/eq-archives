AC in Sro is Easy:

Have tracker

Kill all pumas and all spider types on sand,
nothing else needs to be killed except the specials you
see pop up, A Sand Mummy, Terrorantula, Terrorantuling, AC, etc
(really not even sure if those need to be killed)

Took me 50 minutes doing this to get through all the rares and then 
the AC, its random. I was doing it at 4 am with no one in the zone but
me, KEI on, and nuking every puma/spider type that was on track at 
level 56.

You can see it working in track pretty well:

4 pumas spawn

kill

4 spiders spawn

kill

repeat, etc

AC spawns

whatever else.

With Sciorrie I was nuking them down about as fast as they spawned,
with little or no time between spawns. I'd sit for a second and 4 new 
pumas or a special. If ONE spider or puma is left, whatever those mobs
would spawn won't come.
