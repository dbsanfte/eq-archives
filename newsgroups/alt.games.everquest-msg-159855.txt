Sorry, thought you were speaking as a Druid.  I'm not surprised at all
that for Wizards quad kiting is overwhelmingly more mana efficient for
solo kills.

Agreed, though for my Paladin the key is the duration.  With PoP ports
it is now feasable to solo with kei most of the time (assuming that the
easy to reach solo spots aren't all camped to death).  Grouped, I'm not
sure I'd notice any difference between kei and c2, except for having to
be refreshed more often, c2 gives me the mana regen I need to handle
stunning frequent caster pulls in a group just fine, even c1 or PotG in
a group is good so long as I am economical in my mana usage.

Root/rot is only one of the options a Necro has available, they have
more ways to kill than Carter has pills.  I'm not even sure if they
care much about kei.  OTOH, if you could offer them a 2.5 hour regen
buff...
