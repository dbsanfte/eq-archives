Have to say I looked at the specs for the server etc etc, and thought NO
FUCKING WAY. Anyone paying for that has got to have half a brain.

I like they way they say there is to be some game master run events. The say
later on, that there will not always be a games master online.

So ya pay loads for it, and if ya lucky ya might, just might get something
extra. As long as you live in the same time zone as the Games Master no
doubt.

IMHO theGM events should be added to all servers, after all look at the
amount of dosh they are getting.
