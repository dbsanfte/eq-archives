Yes, just add onto the next line of the hotkey...
I dunno' if you're into that roleplaying stuff, but here's how I set mine
up:

/g healing %T
/cast 1 (or whatever number your heal spell is in)
: chants a prayer, "Let %T be healed"

One for root:

/g rooting %T CLEAR THE AREA if you don't wanna' be smacked.
/cast 4(or whatever number your root spell is in)

You can also set emotes and delays within the hotkey.

/kneel insertyourcharactersnamehere kneels in prayer.
:chants a prayer, "Let %T be protected"
/pause 6
/cast 3

Hope this helps.
