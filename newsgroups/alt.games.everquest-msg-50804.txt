I did /em begins to cast a spell 
then told them it wouldn't take hold. I labeled the key, Morons.

Til it got changed at level 40, my surname was Icantsow.
Was really bad when I was wearing a bloodstained tunic duel wielding
piercers including a spear as a Barb rogue.  As for the bloodstained
tunic, It was my first character basically, and I had no clue that dex
is damn near useless for a rogue, esp since i followed the green
highlights on character creation and pumped all my points in agil and
dex.  When I went with AC with stats secondary, I stopped being a mana
sponge surprisingly enough heheh.  At 42, I am in near full ravenscale,
with a few pieces of Rygorr, namely bracer and coif.
