You missed my point, but thanks for trying.  I said *I LEVEL EXTREMELY 
SLOWLY BUT EVEN I..* ie, perhaps you should listen to Ben, post your 
equipment, level, race, class, and any other pertinent info, so people 
here can say "oh, when I was playing that type, I went to such and such 
and did such and such".

Or you could just keep refusing to answer questions under the cover of 
"everybody here hates me".
