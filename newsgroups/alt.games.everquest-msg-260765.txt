The very first zone is pretty low level and then they become progressivly
harder.  From others' beta experience. Dralnik's Scar is an outdoor zone,
home of the castle, bridge, and other impressive things you've seen in the
various screenshots. It's about on par with Burning Woods for difficulty, or
some of the more dangerous places in DSP. It's very, very doable at 45 with
poor gear. You can scale up to 50 easily here. The next few zones scale up
to about the same difficulty as Sebelis, T1 planes and T2 planes... all the
way through stuff that's difficult for Time-geared players.

Like instanced quests for levels 5-65 (at last I heard they weren't for the
66-70 crowd.  I guess we are all speculating since the servers are not up
yet.).  No instanced zones you just run around various zone much like you
would for any quest.  Collecting, killing, or hailing various things.

Only you hear your custom macros, everyone else hears their own.

Why?  Necromancer pets will still require bone chips as they always have,
and mages still have an aa where their malachite is never consumed.
Necromancers have an aa that turns anything with a meat graphic into a
bonechip, but this still requires the necromancer to carry multiple bone
chips and remember to buy reagents.

The change in bard PBAE dots has been anounced in several forums over the
last week.  Anyone who reads just about anywhere will already know about it.

I for one am excited about it.  Hopefully I will get to see some of it
today.  I set my patcher to download the files ahead of time, but then this
morning it occured to me that I do not use the patcher to log in, so I need
the whole set.  I am on a broadband connection and looking at a 2 hour
download.  The bright side is that the servers probably still won't be up by
the time I am finished. =)
