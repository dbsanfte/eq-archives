I would swap out sow, quickness, and regen just before you pull for: 

gate
cann 1
1 other situational combat spell. Maybe befriend animal, maybe
cheetah, maybe disempower. Alternatively, maybe a situational cure
like cure poison. I never regen self in middle of a solo fight, just
try to apply it before pulling. Same with haste and sow.

For me (playing on a pvp server) gate is always memed. For you, gate
may be less useful. You could consider replacing gate with sow or
cheetah.

You should start working on the shaman epic quest. The early parts
involve a lot of fetch and carry fed-ex type quests that can be done
by a lvl 30, made easier with some help. The first "difficult" stage
is to kill black dire in Mistmoore, and that's not very difficult but
you wont be able to solo it at 30. The pelt of black dire gets you
some boots that have insta click sow, which makes the fear of sow
dropping a non-issue.
