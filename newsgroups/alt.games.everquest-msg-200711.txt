That is debatable.  There is a fair amount of empirical evidence to suggest 
that you are more likely to get a skillup on a successful combine than a 
failed combine.  Given that assumption, then a higher success rate can mean 
a higher skillup rate.  All depends on how much the stat being used for 
skillups is affected by swapping in the Geerlock.
