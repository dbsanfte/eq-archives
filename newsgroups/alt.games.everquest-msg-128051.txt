Really?  I thought his intentions were perfectly clear.  He's selling
the game (just like Verant) and it comes with a free account (just
like Verant).  He makes it quite clear he is not selling the
characters,  The characters just happen to be on the account for now.
Since the characters don't come with the account and it's going to
cost him $300 to transfer them to another acccount he owns.... well
you do the math.
