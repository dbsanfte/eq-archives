Thats my biggest problem with naggy/vox pickup raids.  It's just tooo much
sitting around waiting.  Waiting for people who 20 minutes after the
specified time to start ask if they can get a pickup, waiting for groups to
form, waiting for buffs, waiting for leader to instruct what buffs to do
while everyone is asking for this or that and having to tell them over and
over to wait till the raid leader says what buffs to give, waiting for
people to get resses that wander off against instruction and fall in the
pit, waiting for the raid to relog and get reorganized because some bozo had
to peak and made the rest of the raid get aggro too soon.  Have I missed
any?  Then there was the taking crap for insisting on open roll when
everyone else wanted NBG even though there was nothing on the loot table I
needed.  Why go to a pickup raid if there is no loot possible to win?  Way
more frustration than rewards involved.
