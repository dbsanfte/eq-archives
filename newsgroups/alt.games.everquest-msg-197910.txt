WHAT?  Someone got a GM rez for that?  I was just such a dumbass
(looking at track, running to meet up with someone, not paying
attention to where I was going).  I didn't even consider petitioning a
GM for help.  It was my own carelessness, not a glitch in the system. 
Yeah, it sucked.  Yeah, it took me a while to get some help to kill
the FGs surrounding my corpse.  That's a risk you take.  I was under
the assumption that GMs only interfered like that when there was a
game error.

Regarding the original poster, I hope that you DO get some assistance.
 You had no control over the LD.
