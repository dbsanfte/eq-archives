Assassinations are the only ones I dont like to do. Why? Because you *have*
to kill 60% of the mobs for the boss to spawn. Even if you go the right way
and clear the bosses room you wont know if its the right room if you havent
killed the full amount yet. Also I hate the fact that the boss room has so
many mobs in it, and that the boss can sometimes be a total PITA. Chanter
bosses... *cringe*. I had a warrior Takish boss who dropped the MT in about
2 secs I didnt even have enough time to hit DvA. In another one the boss was
a cleric and gated. We cleared the room first so it wasnt that bad but that
could get messy in some situations.

Rescues are great because the NPC is up from the start of the mission.
Fastest rescue mission I have done was in 20 minutes. So far I have seen no
pathing issues though sometimes the NPC gets stuck its no problem you just
have to baby him to the zone. No problem.
