Most characters seem to be able to find a home there by the upper 30s.  The
giants will remain blue through 45.  Their levels seemed to be pretty
tightly packed together, in that they almost all seemed to go cyan in 46 and
47.  They are easy enough solo for druids, necros, and wizards, and maybe
some others, but melee chars will want some healing backup -- the giants hit
pretty hard.  If you're 35 plus, I'd give it a shot in case the are some
melees there who cannot get enough healing.  A bit more mercenary, but if
you cannot get a group and don't mind not getting exp, you could just sell
rezzes until a group opens.  I know your 34 rez is only 50%, but in my
experience, rezzes in Rathe Mountains are a seller's market, and I'd expect
you could do some business while waiting on a group.
