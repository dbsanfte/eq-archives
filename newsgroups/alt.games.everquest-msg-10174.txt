Isn't *this* the thread that you originally intended for debate? It
certainly seems to go by the same exact name as the one you suggested in
part one. Also, how in the hell am I supposed to know that you
mistakenly posted something to this thread that didn't belong? By the
way, weren't you going to lurk? What ever happened to that? It sure
seemed like a good idea at the time.
