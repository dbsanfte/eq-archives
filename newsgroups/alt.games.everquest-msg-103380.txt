What?  Read the manual?  I'm sure I have it somewhere on my computer.  That
is generally the way I use OOC anyway, yes.  Given that it is in the manual,
I will accept that is Verant's intended use for the channel as well.  I
don't honestly care if people do use if for bragging, or much of anything
else, I will just filter it out if it bothers me.
