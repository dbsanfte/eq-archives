Hi everyone, 

I was hoping some people here could help with any advice on this zone.
I know how to get in there, as we went down there today with 2 full
groups. We ended up not having much time to explore, and it seemed as
if we were heading in circles.

I was hoping some people may know something about the mobs there
(other than the chokidais and such that you encounter for a little
bit) and any other useful information. Maps, Boss mobs, traps,
anything hidden, etc,...

Thanks in advance for any help you can give!
