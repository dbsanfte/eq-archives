Its been a while since I played EQ, I left the game just over 12
months ago. Trouble with leaving the game for a while, is SOE carry on
releasing upgrades and patches in your absence.

So here is the question...

What do you have to do to access the planes?

The planes that are available from the Plane of Knowledge appear to
have level restrictions, and I have read somewhere aboit quests to set
entry flags or something?

I have all expansions enabled, just wondering what I need to do to
visit the places I havent seen yet...
