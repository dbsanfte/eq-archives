Do you consider it rude for someone to look at you?

By that I mean, do you hate it when I look at you from across the zone and 
see that you are wearing boots with a yellow graphic?

Does it disturb you when someone can tell you're wearing plate instead of 
banded?  If no, then why is it disturbing to you for someone to be able to 
tell the difference between items with the same graphic?

Would you prefer that every piece of armor had it's own unique graphic, or 
for everyone to have exactly the same graphics and look exactly the same?  
If you prefer the former, then why does it disturb you for people to be 
able to see what different things people are wearing?

Why is it disturbing for someone to be able to see that Fine Plate 
Neckguard on your character?  Or to see what color ring you are wearing?

Are you offended when someone on the street can see that you are wearing 
pants made by Levi or Union Bay or Lee's or whathaveyou?  How is the EQ 
inspection any different?  All the EQ inspection does is allow the player 
to see the name of the item you're wearing.  Are you really expecting that 
a warrior in their 50th season would not be able to tell the difference 
between a piece of banded armor and a piece of Ogre Splintmail (they have 
the same graphic appearance)?

Here is the halfway reasonable reason why inspection can't be by consent 
only.  It is the method by which players can tell the difference between 
items with the same graphic, and to see the items which the game engine 
does not show but you would normally be able to see anyway.  You're not 
getting very much respect for the position you hold because it's like 
someone walking down the street yelling "Don't LOOK at me!" to anyone who 
dared glance in their direction.

The simple fact is, it IS someobody else's business to inspect you, just as 
much as it is their business to see the color of the armor you are wearing 
from across the room, because it is THE SAME THING.  You behave as if they 
are copping a feel or looking up your skirt, and that is not what is 
happening.

"Atrocity is recognized as such by victim and perpetrator alike, by all
who learn about it at whatever remove. Atrocity has no excuses, no
mitigating argument. Atrocity never balances or rectifies the past.
Atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-
perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
