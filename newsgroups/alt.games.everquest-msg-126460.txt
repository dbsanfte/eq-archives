OT is no excuse!  You can post anything you like, but my point
was don't whine if you don't get the response you're looking
for.  There, I spelled it out for you.  Happy now?  You think
that's rude?  LOL, you don't know what rude is, greenhorn!

"Ask a silly question, get a silly answer;" a wise man once
said.  The modern paraphrase is: "post an OT question, get an
OT response."  Learn to deal.
