OW!!! That's a lotta cash. I don't have a cleric (killed mine off at lvl 5
from sheer boredom), but I do have an 18 druid, and I NEVER charge for any
buffs I give. I'm not old enough to port, so I really don't know the whole
story here (and if someone can tell me why druids or wizzies charge so much
to port, I'll be more than happy to listen!), but I can't imagine myself
saying "ok, a port to GF (or wherever) is gonna cost you x$$". And maybe
that's why I'll probably always be broke. I dunno. I've got some cash at the
moment, but that will be long gone shortly, just for armor and stuff, if
nothing else. Darklet still has the same armor on that she's had for many
many lvls... not even sure what it is anymore, but it ain't great ('cept my
Imbued boots which a guy GAVE me!!)... maybe patchwork? Can't really afford
any better, not with spell costs, as well, but I suppose I'll have to,
sooner or later. Started killing gorge hounds in the Karanas last night (and
with the help of a 56 druid, an evil eye). I know they're not exactly well
known for the cash they give, but hey, I might just get my lvl ;)
