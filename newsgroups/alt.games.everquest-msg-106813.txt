<snip great info>

Thanks a heap - that info was great, I printed it out and will try it out
tonight : )

I suspect most my interface problems come from not being able to touch type,
hence losing all keyboard accuracy as soon as my eyes leave the keyboard.
Compounding the problem is that I am a damn quick 2 finger type - so when
errors occur they normally occur in a big way, more often than not involving
a pressing of the "a" key in a compromising  situation.....

BTW - I tried remapping, but am so used to it in default layout that it
caused more grief than the occasional NPC thrashing.
