enchanting gold when I work on jewelcraft.

Sidenote: sabertooth pelts finally STACK!!! (Hence, last night gained
me more than 20 bank slots on my main character alone, and a couple
more bank slots for my alts. One side effect is that it's lowered my
incentive to make studded cultural boots for the sake of clearing bank
space while skilling up, since the boots won't stack. I'll just make
them to order instead :) )
