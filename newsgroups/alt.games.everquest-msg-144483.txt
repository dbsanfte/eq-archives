I can think of a number of serious criticisms of EQ, but id rate these as
pretty trivial.
If you think waiting 15 mins is bad, or having to do a quest more than 15
times is bad, try some of the epic quests, like ragefire or the pegasus
feather cloak. Or try getting your faction up in cabilis. Try camping the ac
for your jboots ring.
I seem to remember it was in the order of 8000 bonechips, or doing the quest
2000 times to get into cabilis.
I also think its pretty stupid that merchants wont sell to you if they dont
like you. Since when was liking someone a prerequisite for making money off
them? The whole vendor system is flawed anyway. If the vendors where actual
people, they all go broke, except maybe the spell and gem vendors.
Faction is questionable too. Why should me killing a monster off by itself
with no other mobs around, suddenly become globally known by all others on
its faction. Who told them it was me? maybe they have some form of group
telepathy, and of course photagraphic memory since they can all remember it
was me after years of play. /laugh
