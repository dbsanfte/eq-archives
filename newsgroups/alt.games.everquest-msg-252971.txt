After your posting, i go to www.eqatlas.de and get a map of Lower/Upper Guk.

I went to Upper Guk with my Level 51 Bard and zone in.
All Frogs are Doubiose so i can go to Lower Guk without been attacked.

I zone in the Liveing-Side of LG and went from there to the Death-Side.
There i meet a Level 65 Monk.

I go in the Room, but no Mob was up.
After 2 Minutes, one Mob spawned and while i am fighting the assisin
(Drop-Mob) spawned.

The Assassin was down very fast (because of the 65 Monk).

The one Mob was light Blue, the Assasin was Blue to Level 51.
I think u can make it at 51 solo, when u know what u do and when u know how
to use your Mezz/Charm-Song.

Now i have the Mask after 2 Minutes...;-)

Very cool:-)
