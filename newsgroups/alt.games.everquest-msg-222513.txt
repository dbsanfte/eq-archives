I reboot my work XP machine about once every couple of months or whenever a
MS security update requires a reboot. This is pretty much average for most
of our work stations here but I am running a set number of apps - about 6
browser windows, 2 databases, 2 email apps, messenger, seti@home , citrix
management console and telephony software. The machines on our test bench
are a different story though as they are constantly getting all sorts of
software thrown at them and tossed otu again.

My home W2K is very stable considering the amount of software I have added /
removed from it since last rebuild a little over a year ago. Again, I leave
it running and only need to reboot every couple of weeks (unless a security
update requires reboot as well). When something falls over like EQ - I just
three finger salute it and start again which was unheard of before W2K
arrived.

My home machine is a bit long in the tooth as well - Athlon Thunderbird 1.2
gig with 768mb of PC133 ram. I attribute it's stability only to the fact it
has sufficient RAM, as it has the dubious status of being put together by
me, and every day is a friday where I am concerned.
