If its a matter of gettting a group or guild of like minded people 
together and limiting yourself as to what you choose to do and accept, 
you can do that on any server.  I have done, in fact, just that, played 
with a small guild worth of people who swore not to use the bazaar, not 
to twink, not to use anything we didn't loot ourselves.

Two problems with this approach.  One is finding sufficient people 
interested in the same approach and willing to stick with it for the lon 
g haul.  Interest petered out, I'm afraid, for most people in that small 
guild.

Another is that although WE were limiting ourselves, those around us 
were not, so we'd have to compete with people in very high level twink 
gear (another way to put that would be junk they bought in the bazaar 
for 5pp each) going after same spawns.

But thats not the real point here, I'm not interested in limiting myself 
to a dozen or two people, I want to have thousands of potential partners 
and competitors, thats what puts the Massive in Massively Multiplayer 
after all.  Combine provides just that, a server with more people on it 
than any of the other servers operating, crammed into just a few zones 
(too few, perhaps, at this early stage), so you can GET a group, just 
about any level, any zone.  And you don't have the huge array of gear, 
where one person has a windblade and another is using a FS Two hander.

I'm not saying I don't want Kunark opened, I'm just saying I wish it was 
another month away.  I'm not saying I don't want Velious opened, 
honestly its my favorite expansion... I'm just saying I hope it takes a 
couple months rather than a couple weeks (we have no idea what the 
minimum time restriction will be; some say a month but noone knows).

As these expansions open, the game changes, and not just for the people 
who actually go there, but for the rest who stay home; selling old world 
drops in EC tunnel for example, is different knowing that in just a 
couple days there will be Kunark era drops coming in instead.  A stick 
your head in the sand plan (and again, I've done that, had some fun with 
  it, but I know its limitations) doesn't help the fact that the bulk of 
the buying and selling public aren't limiting themselves.

Similarly, content that people are competing for against other people 
with level 50 cap, old world gear, old world buffs... is going to be 
different when competing with people in their 50s with better gear and 
better buffs.  You can't just shut your eyes and pretend they aren't 
there... that would actually be much easier to do on a regular server, 
where there's really nobody IN LGuk, IN Sol B, IN Fear... easy to ignore 
the people that have ultra gear in the zones that are now considered 
junk when they don't even bother going to those zones.

Am I up in arms, or quitting the server, or even whining about it 
really?  No, I'm just saying I wish it were a little slower, for my 
tastes that would be better, and I've seen a lot of other people say the 
same.
