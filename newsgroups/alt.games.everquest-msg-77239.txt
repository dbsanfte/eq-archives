Waitaminute.  The Overthere is Kunark, not Velious.  Kunark has zones
that are great for all level ranges.  Velious starts out at around
level 30.

If you want to try Kunark out, I suggest hitting the Frontier
Mountains.  Nice place to hunt for your 20's.  Once you get into your
30's, The Overthere begins to look attractive.
