If all that you say is correct, then explain why once I have been rampaged, if
I drop lower on the hate list without moving out of range, it will rampage
someone else instead.

It's not a matter of having witnessed it.... I have done it.  I have been
rampaged, not moved out of range, and had the rampage move on to another
character while I waited to be healed.
