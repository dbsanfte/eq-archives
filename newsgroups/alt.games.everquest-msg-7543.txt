There are lots of older players in EQ. This newsgroup seems to have an
average age of around 30, though in game it seems to be low 20s. I
personally know two players older than you on my server, and I don't
exactly wander around asking people's ages. I recall a few months back
a post from someone forming a mature players guild, though I can't
recall the age limits.
