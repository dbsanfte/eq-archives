One of my first experiences as a iksar monk was being killed by something I
couldn't see or fight whilst standing next to guards picking their teeth
while i bled to death. It had fallen through the walls of the pit and was
using a z-axis exploit to get me .. frankly i think it should have had it's
account banned!

Some months later, I accidentally fell through the pit wall too. Survived,
due to my monkly skills but had to run around being chased by lots of red to
me critters (no fd back then). I didn't know if it was safe to log, as for
all i knew my character would be deleted if he was found in an impossible
place in memory; now i know that it was unlikely although i might have lost
all my gear or similar (many horror stories of corpses lost in walls etc). I
stopped playing for six months, then started again because of a friend, but
kept well away from that field of bone.

Eventually I was able to walk out through a dungeon wall, past a lot of red
indifferent undead (what was that all about? why didn't they attack?) but it
was pretty traumatic, and it left a nasty taste in my mouth whenever i think
of their coding; at least in some zones they move you to a safe point if you
fall through, but the fact that the same bug existed for years, a bug that
doesn't seem to affect any other 3d game, a bug that really can hurt the
enjoyment of the customers, shocked me. I'd worked as a programmer and
couldn't understand why such things weren't a priority to them.

Now I know that many companies have that attitude of taking customers for
granted, and when confronted with unhappy customers, simply allocate more
money to propaganda, and it saddens me to say that I think Verant is well
and truly on this path. Instead of fixing everquest, it's being scrapped for
eq 2, and all the work people have put into their characters will vanish
like poems in a firestorm.
