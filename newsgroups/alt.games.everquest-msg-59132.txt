 I like it. Had it go off twice in a row last night for 200+ hits each
time. Felt rather nice doing 1200 damage in about 2 seconds. Sure hope
that makes me UBER so I can keep playing EQ. I'd hate to find out I
wasn't and end up being deported to DAoC.

 Anyway, monks triple-attack isn't based on the Luclin skill advancement
thingie. But I'm sure you knew that.
