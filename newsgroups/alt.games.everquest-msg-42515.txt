    Before Evade the damage wasn't exactly "sick". You're talking about
someone likely having an 8/27 piercer mainhand and an 8/24 slasher offhand,
who had no minimum damage on the backstab. Compared with a warrior in the
rear arc who had two Yaks, there's not a lot of damage differential. What IS
massive is the aggro created by even a missed backstab.

    Over this weekend I did Pool in Sol B with my 45 rogue (Crystalline
Fang/Velium Short Blade, Handwraps haste), a cleric, and a 44 WIZ. Nothing
ever left me for the WIZ, and he soon figured out that if he stood behind
the mob and nuked with his largest nuke that I could immediately turn the
mob back around with BS, Disarm, Pick Pockets. Even against a mob with no
weapon and a successful PP roll, and a whiffed BS, it would turn back
around.

    Strong point. Now if only that "perfectly still to hide" thing was
fixed.
