You forgot "and the stone is a rare drop, so you'll have to kill her multiple

Oh, and "and she's one of the frequently KS'd mobs of EQ, not so bad
as the SRo AC, but still be prepared for competition" although with a 52

she's so low level that someone with tracking and a better attention span
might have her dead before you know she's up.
