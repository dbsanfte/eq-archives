Heh.  In typical SOE fashion, I see the tables have turned quite a bit now.
When I stopped playing last, knights were the premier tanks, with warriors
shit on at every opportunity, while shaman could take every important role
an enchanter could do and help with the healing as well.

I've read the Shaman side of things, but whats going on with the Knights
these days?

Did the warrior aggro "fix" that had just gone in help that much?   Or were
new abilities / AA's added in GoD that recovered them, without similar added
for knights?   Knights nerfed in the aggro generating abilities?

Whats changed since then, from a knights point of view?



(Not disputing it, as I've heard others mention the same general view.
Hard to believe, considering how long they let the warrior situation fester,
but at the same time easy to believe, considering Sony's habit of fixing
imbalances with a sledge hammer.)
