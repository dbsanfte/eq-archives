Yes, I know.  But still, that means you've never been in a group
with just a druid healer, or just a cleric healer for that
matter; there's always been a shaman for backup, the only single
healer groups you can have been in would be single shaman ones.

Aye, Paladins are handy backup healers; in a real emergency
there's a nice fat LOH waiting, and otherwise they have some nice
heals and even that DW helm feed; 600hp per minute regen on the
shaman isn't the worst thing you can bring to the party.
