My first ever was a wood elf ranger with a similar lifespan.  I'm sure 
those who have been to Kelethin can guess why. :)  In my defense, this was 
in the days when you needed to turn up the gamma before even the non-blind 
races could see at night.  I thought it was just dark over there at the 
edge of the wood floor.
