The pity is best reserved for those who shout in capital
letters at people who don't share their viewpoint, and have
such closed minds that they can't see themselves doing
the same thing that they criticise.

I'm sure the fact that *you* can justify these innocent Palestinian
deaths by attaching the label "collateral damage" makes all
the difference in the world to the innocent dead.

You go around criticising others for saying "yes, but, yes, but,
yes, but" - and yet when it comes to the deaths Israelis
cause, this is all we hear from you.
