well it really depends on if you are going to be running SoL or not. If you
are then go for both and a RAM upgrade. 512 recommended... but if you're not
running SoL then go for the harddrive. you can get a 60GB hrddrive for about
$70 at compusa if you have to. then just slave it out and turn half of it
into a swap file
