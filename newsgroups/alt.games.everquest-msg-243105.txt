This happened to me, and the "moving back and forth" trick didn't work.
What I did was to use a lev potion to run out to the boat and meet it before
it got to the dock.  That seemed to "attach" me to the boat, and when it
pulled away from the dock I went with it and zoned into Abysmal.

Yes, very annoying bug I hope they fix soon.
