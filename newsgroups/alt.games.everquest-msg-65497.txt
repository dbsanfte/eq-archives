Castersrealm also mystified.

Hmm, how would you know if your mana level had changed?

I'm thinking it is likely a smaller level Gift of Magic, as the effect of that
is very difficult to see.  Try casting it on a newbie who is at FM, a boost of
20 or 30 mana in their pool should be visible until they med it back up.

Alternately, someone who has the ability to decode the SPDAT file might be able
to clue us in.
