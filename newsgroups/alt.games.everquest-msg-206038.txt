I tried the shackle quest ages ago. Camped the raptors for a while with
a ranger friend and someone else for several hours and no dice. Ranger
camped them a pretty good while the next day, still didn't get any. Never
did get the shackles, still have the stupid branch tho. =P You'd prolly be
better off looking thru the bazaar for an upgrade.

Most of the mobs in cc at 40 prolly would be lightblue except geos if you
somehow manage to get the camp. Might try solb or echo with a good group.
