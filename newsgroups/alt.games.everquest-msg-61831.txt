Man, I wish my sock draw ( sic ) were sorted.  Pompous?  Nah, I just think 
people that aren't courteous are idiots.  Maybe it's not their fault with 
all the horrible fucking parents in this country, but they can choose to 
change when given good examples.

I'm a programmer and around intelligent, logical people all day.  If I 
wanted to be around kids, I'd work at a day-care.  I'd be in jail for 
homicide ( killing the parents of the feebs ), though, so I'll stay away 
from that career path.

He may be guilty of lazy typing, and if he's too lazy to type like someone 
with an iq higher than a loaf of bread, then I'm too busy to buff him.  
It's that simple.  But - it's not laziness for the most part, it's kids 
trying to look "cool".  They can go get buffs from their other kiddie 
friends who ooh and aaah over their prepubescent communication skills, but 
they ain't getting them from me.

Yes, it amuses me to see an idiot in frustration.  To no end, I might add!  
I don't deny it.  Dick him around, you say?  I guess that's what you could 
call educating someone - if you are one of those kids.

I need to get higher goals!  Pissing off the idiots is too easy!  But, 
pissing off the intelligent, courteous people is stupid, so I'll shy away 
from that.

> I remember now why I quit this NG before.

I'm sure you could have asked and the people who remembered you would have 
reminded you.  Although, I'm sure it was more along the lines of "I'm 
taking my toys and going home!" because you got pummelled with intelligent 
comments that didn't jibe with your pre-teen ideals.  Good luck in the real 
world, d00d.  You'll need it.
