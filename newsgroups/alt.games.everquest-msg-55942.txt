Just got the above card,very nice sound in most cases apart from
EQ.I'm running 2K and almost everyone knows the problems Live
cards have with it.The same is the case for the Audigy I'm afraid.
The 2k drivers are pretty bad.Very bad sound in EQ all round.
Then I thought I'd try the XP drivers,and low and behold the sound is great
under 2K with the XP drivers.Installed without a hitch.So if your having
probs under 2K with your Audigy card,install the XP drivers,it worked for
me.
Safe hunting.
