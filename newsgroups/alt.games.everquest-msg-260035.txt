Yes, that's actually the point I made in my original post. The game mechanic 
itself doesn't seem like it should necessarily present a problem. But see 2) 
above (my reference to the battle.net crowd). For some reason, Blizzard's 
game appears to have attracted a class of people who still have a way to go 
on the evolutionary scale of common courtesy and enlightened self-interest. 
And for all the squawking you hear in A.G.E. about various problems, I'm 
convinced beyond question that EverQuest has the most mature and courteous 
population of any of the MMOGs I've experienced (I haven't played FF 
online).

I havea theory on this. I think part of the answer lies in the maturity of 
the online game community and the leadership offered by the EQ team. After 
Doom opened the way to LAN games in 1993 or so, online game communities were 
still somewhat slow to develop. It took forever to set something up 
(remember trying to get Kali configured for LAN games over the Internet)? 
Several different directions emerged. There were lots of folks playing FPS 
like Duke Nukem (that was huge on Kali), Doom and Quake, and then battle.net 
in 1997 opened up a whole new world for action players online. Battle.net, 
because it was so popular and so vulernable, became a magnet for every 
hacker/griefer wannabee in the online community and they came to know and 
love Blizzard, whose tacit support never wavered (despite many empty 
pronouncements and occasional minimalist acts to the contrary). Simply 
stated, Blizzard simply let it get out of hand and never lifted more than a 
token finger in the direction of correcting the problems with their 
community.

When UO came out in 1997 it attracted many of these same folks and became 
yet another haven for griefers and hackers, again largely as a result of 
both the popularity and vulnerability of the game system. And again, more 
importantly, was the lack of strong leadership guiding the game in a 
different direction. With the benefit of hindsight now, it appears that the 
UO team tried too hard to favor freedom of action over discipline and their 
game became equally synonymous with Diablo in terms of hacking and griefing.

In 1998 Verant offered a new alternative. Seasoned, old-time MUD and D&D 
players had an opportunity to participate in something exciting and 
different. You could tell even then that the crowd pursuing EQ was a 
different breed than those attracted to UO and other online games at the 
time. And with Brad McQuaid at the helm, laying down the law forcefully and 
without hesitation, Verant did a respectable job of maintaining a culture 
that did not tolerate abusive behaviors or exploits. He publicly banned 
accounts and entire guilds when necessary, never fearing to take criticism 
at what this might do to paying subscribers who were being ejected. What he 
gambled on was that the resulting culture would support his direction, and I 
think he was proven right. He really did set a tone that made EverQuest 
different and it paid off for them. I'm convinced that a lot of players 
stuck it out over many years with that franchise as a result of this 
approach. The result now is a more mature audience that has learned that 
courtesy and self-discipline are not only expected, they provide a better 
overall experience for everyone. My take on it.
