I have been thinking to buy one of these for my rogue, but which one
would be better? 

Studded
11 AC
8 STR
12 DEX
8 WIS


Reinforced
14 AC
10 STR
10 STA
6 WIS


The question actually limits itself here to : what is more useful, DEX
or STA?

I would say DEX on first guess as I would like every backstab to land
- considering it can only be used once every 10 seconds or so (haven't
timed). But how important is STA for a rogue really? Sure, we rogues
aren't tanks but we'll get hit up hard from time to time - especially
since I learned that "evade" isn't very reliable either.
I am quite new to the class so any advise would be welcome.
