Not really. I can look up the people who won the various Olympic
events anytime I want. Just owning the medal doesn't make you
an Olympic medal winner. It'd be the same in a game - if people
really care whether someone "earned" or bought his equipment,
there are easy enough ways to differentiate the two.

Sure. But that's nothing at all like what's being discussed. 
Being able to buy items with out-of-game cash is like having
a system where Olympic athletes have to work hard to earn
good equipment, but then someone comes along who bought the
equipment on his own. More power to him, I say, but he's
still going to have to compete with everyone else.

Not to me. And don't people buy and sell magical items within
the game anyway? If so, I don't see any important difference.

Of course not. But when I hear about a game character with a
super-cool magic item, that doesn't impress me, either.
