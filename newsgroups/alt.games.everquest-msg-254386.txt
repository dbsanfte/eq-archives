Goodbye, and don't let the door hit you on the way out.

Thats how i'd respond anyway... good lord, it was 2 fucking LDONs that you
probably lost and are too stupid to realise. Nobody else has had the
problem, I doubt anybody else will have the problem, how are they supposed
to quantify your claims to "refund" you?

No wonder gm's cant get much done, people bog them down with the most
pointless and stupid shit

/petition give me phat loots or i quit EQ !
