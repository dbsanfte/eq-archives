i agree on the password thing...

if a friend needs one of my characters in the game, they, another friend, or
my wife could log me in.

one of my friends even has a guild leader's password. he logs in with their
Cleric every now and then when someone needs a rez. he has access to at
least 4 accounts... do i trust him? hell yes... i would never think he would
do something bad to my account. if he decided to check out my character and
accidently got them killed - i would probably log in later to find my
character perfectly fine, with MORE exp than i originally had, and probably
an extra hundred plat on me.

its just known by some people who share accounts that "if you get someone
killed, you have to get them their exp back"
