Don't bet on being able to get a box with CD. The box ebgames shows is just
a mock-up of the LOY site graphic. It even says "For Illustration Only". And
that the ship date and price haven't been confirmed by Sony. I think EBGames
and Gamestop are just jumping the gun. Sony still says it's download only.
