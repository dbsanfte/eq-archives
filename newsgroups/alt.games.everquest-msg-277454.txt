It's not an accident it you read the patch notes you would of seen
these are changes to 'downgrade zones' people were talking about. They
are trying it out on the live servers to see what people think.

And you are right to be weary of a group of 5 white gnolls. I've found
3 blue-- just doable, 2 white touch, anymore and you'll get one quick
death. Although I did manage 3 yellow-- sirens. Four well and truly
beat me though!

Just for the record gaint scots are solo encounters all other giants,
gnolls and undead in that area are still heroic. The undead near the
Tomb Of Varsoon are now solo too.
