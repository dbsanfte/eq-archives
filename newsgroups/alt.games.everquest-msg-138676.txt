Hi:

I'm having an infuriating problem, and am hoping that someone here can help
me.

I'm running Windows XP Professional, which is a clean install, and all the
Windows updates have been applied. I have a Gigabyte of RDRAM and a 1.4 GHz
processor. My graphics cards is an NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 and the driver is
version 2.9.4.2. This driver was downloaded from Windows Update, so I'm
assuming that it's Windows endorsed.

Now to my problem. I can play EverQuest with no problems at all for a little
while, and then, for reason unknown to me a very noticeable transformation
in graphics happens on my screen. The best way do describe it would be to
say that the trees, mountains, buildings and other objects are covered with
small brown dots, it looks very much like nodes or vectors used to outline
the shape of the objects. Once this happens I'm still able to play
EverQuest, but obviously I don't want this all over my screen. After these
dots appear I've noticed that EverQuest will *not* shut down properly when I
camp, even I use the /q command. I'm just left hanging looking at a blank
black screen. I am then forced to shut my PC down and reboot that way, but
sadly, when this happens I can never get a clean boot from my PC, the
boot-up screen is so garbled I have to shut down again. The only way I seem
to able to get a clean boot (graphically) is to leave my PC off for a few
hours, and that seems to do the trick. I have *no* problems with my graphics
other than with EverQuest, so I'm really stumped. I'm not sure what BIOS
version of my graphics card is, or even how to find it.

Please, if someone can help me out here I'd be very grateful. I'm fed up of
playing for an hour and then having to wait several hours before I can
re-boot.

Thank you kindly as always, safe hunting.

Stevie.
