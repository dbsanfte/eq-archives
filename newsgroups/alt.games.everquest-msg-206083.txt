Finally, after all this time, I have personal perspective on the KEI
thing.  Sunday night after I dinged I got KEI so I could work on my
tailoring with all of my crystalline silks from velks.  Never bothered
before with KEI except on raids, but I decided that it's worth it for
tradeskills.

So after this we go to the Grey to camp Ancient Shissar Servitor fellow
(no show yet, woefuls), and I still had KEI.  I aer a dum rayngur, and I
forgot to buy arrows, and pulling with snare is just...slow...so I was
pulling with Calefaction.  No problems. 80-90% mana almost constantly.

KEI went away on me, and next thing I know "Insufficient Mana to cast this
spell."

D'oh

Now I pull with snare so I can med at camp while watching the beast lumber
towards me. :) Honestly, my sitting mana regen is perfectly acceptable,
I'm just a somewhat hyper ranger, so never considered that I could *gasp*
med so that I can actually use my spells when I fight.

Ok, didn't contribute much, just was excited to FINALLY say something in a
KEI-related thread.

P.S.  Yeah, mean players suck.  It's such the understatement of the year
that I can't think of any way to contribute to the original subject of
this thraad.
