Hello everyone I am new at posting to the newsgroup.  But I figured since I
am not getting much in the way of help from tech support (with the exception
of an outrageous phone bill) I am hoping some fellow EQ addicts could help
me

Here are my paramaters:
PII 400 (which it seems is slowly but surely dwindling down to being the
problem)
512 RAM
64MB NVidia GeForce2 Video Card
Cable Modem

I lock up ALL of the time while playing.  Some times it takes longer than
others, but especially when I group.  When grouped I get dropped no more
than 10 minutes after grouping.

Any ideas???
It seems a shame that if I knew this was going to be the case I could have
spent the $250.00 that I upgraded with and bought a better processor so I
could play DAoC

Thanks
