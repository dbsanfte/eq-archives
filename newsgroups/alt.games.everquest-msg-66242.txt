    Yes, they do. By level 49 you have a pet that looks as big as a house,
at least to my dwarf. I've heard that pets cast with the focus item in hand
look bigger as well as having more HPs and/or stats, but I haven't been able
to tell with my water pet. Squishy looks just the same today.

    It was a nice touch, but a little necessary. Imagine if folks had been
stuck with whatever face the artist decided looked most like the old
