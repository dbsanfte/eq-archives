I think ive made money overal with jewelry, and I havnt sold any to other
players yet.
How?
Easy, by crafting a gemstone into a piece of jewely, I effectively get a
better price for it, than just selling the stone. (especialy if I enchant
the metal first)
Ok, so sometimes I dont have the skill required, but If I wasnt interested
in training my jewelry and stuck with silver, I'd probably come out ahead.
