You could always roleplay a beggar and then pass any money and items onto
another character. You could have one slot always open for the creation of a
"newbie" beggar. If the character becomes "hated", you could simply change
it.

In fact, if you have fun playing a beggar, then by all means do so, because
fun is what it is all about, isn't it?
