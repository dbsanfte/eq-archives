Being as berserk are one of the mana bar free classes, POTG's never 
going to beat even a Temp for me.

Sadly Aego seems to be rare these days, I've found one virtue vendor in 
four who had it.  Was a nice kick in the pants when I did though.

Faith I recall using primarily for buffing pets when we didn't feel like 
blowing peridot on them, Kazad on the other hand found more use than 
Virtue in that it would stack happily alongside POT9 which makes a 
better combo for 75% of the people you'll meet; Virtue's principle 
virtue is that it lasts a long time, so its handy for buffing people who 
aren't actually going to group with you.
