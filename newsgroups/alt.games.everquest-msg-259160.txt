The GBS has 20 DEX to help you learn your skill.  If you are below 40
or 45 (I forget the level required for the weapon to process), the
extra dex will help you learn your weapon skills.  Not much use in
using it if you are high enough to process the weapon and have a DEX
buff from a shaman.  You don't really need buffs when practicing with
a weapon since the caster can call off the pet any time or even put
the pet on hold and let you swing at it.
