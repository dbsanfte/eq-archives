Maybe they could make a bazaar in every major city. They could put
limits and costs on running one so that you can't just place a vendor
without actually running it properly.

The way it is now only a very select few can properly run vendors,
those with 24/7 connections and a spare system to run it from.

Offline trading is the way to go.... there must be a way to do it that
would make the bazaar, and running a vendor better for all of us.
