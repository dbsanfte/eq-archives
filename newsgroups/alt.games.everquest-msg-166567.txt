Hi there,

I was a regular EQ player until about 2 years ago when I moved to a slightly
rural area with a terrible internet connection.  I have since moved back to
civilization and I've been considering playing again.  However, I have a
concern about which I'm hoping some of you could offer comments:

Since there have been 4 or 5 expansions since the original EQ was released,
I'm worried that areas might actually get too sparsely populated.  While it
could be a problem in the past to have too many people in certain zones
competing for kills, quests, etc., it was still fun to actually see other
people playing the game.  Not to mention that every once in a while you or
your group would take on more than you could handle and some friendly
passerby would step in and save your life.  :)  If there are still the same
number of players per server (2000 - 3000), and now 2 or 3 times the number
of zones, is there a problem with too many ghost-town type zones?  Is it
harder to find players to group with because everyone is so spread out?  Is
it possible to have too many zones?

Any input on this would be greatly appreciated!

John
