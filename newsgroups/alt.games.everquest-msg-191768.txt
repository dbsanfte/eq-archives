This is going end with the patch today. Lot of events can be aided by use of
charm for CC as a form of mez or charm a pet and use it to offtank. Thanks
to all the jealous little whiners in the EQ community CoD is being nuked out
of existence.. not just nerfed a little.. destroyed. Still I got up to 334AA
hehe.

Thanks for the post, made a good read. Lets hope Sony finally pull their
fingers out and do what they said they were going to do. 1) Fix all the
nasty bugs and quests in PoM and 2) Make the zone more accessible. It has
the potential to be a fun zone and is just wasted.
