My impressions as well, also pre-expansion. Fights are shorter and much
more pre-determined than EQ fights. There is rarely a sense that a good
group can rescue a bad situation. If a caster gets agro, they die,
always faster then even the quickest heal can save them, much less a
quick reacting tank getting agro off them. Tanks are reduced to spamming
their one agro generating style; so much for the vaunted melee system of
picking attacks based on enemy moves. Add in that higher level heals
have worse ratios and casting times than lower level ones so some
healers deliberately lock themselves out of the higher healing powers
and other problems and I packed it in after about 4 months of play. I
mainly lasted that long because of having a real life friend playing
too.

My friend, who's gone back a few times since, says they have put most of
the fixes for classes into realm abilities, which are sort of like aa
but earned for making rvr kills, so you have to play your gimped class
to the high levels to start to earn them to fix the inherant design
flaws. Buff bots are a huge problem, as buffs have infinite range in
DAoC so the characters using them are buffed up godlike and you can't
kill the buffer as he'll be parked at a fort someplace. Just travelling
with someone who can buff you wont counter this, he'll basically be the
first one targetted for death if caught out in the open.
