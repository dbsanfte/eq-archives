I don't know if this has been fixed, but as of several months ago,
this is incorrect.  Due to guild alliances and a good deal of
personal stupidity, I allowed myself to get involved in a duel
dispute.  A quild mate engaged someone in a duel, and that person
managed to duck out of the combat and go get healed under false
pretenses.  I managed to confirm that this had happened, and hit
my buddy with a retaliatory heal.  Since I did this in the open,
it was of course witnessed by other people, so that when the
original cheater complained, some healers took his side and
healed -him-  I asked them to scroll up and look at the OOC
conversation where the orginal cheat had occurred, and once
again healed -my- guy to set back to the original condition... and
this went on for most of an hour.  Several healers were on the
rogue, while the rogue was unable to damage my guy at a rate
approaching that with which I could med back for heals, so we
were at a standoff.  Stupid, stupid, stupid, after all this was
a meaningless point of honor, exposed as treachery in ooc
channel, and a complete waste of time and energy on the part
of several people.

You would -think- that activating duel mode would put
you in protected status like handing in your PvP book,
and some claim that this is true for buffs, but unless its been
fixed, it decidedly is -not- true for heals.  Further, since the
healer is not in the duel, he can't be engaged to stop him from
doing so, or from medding back the mana.

Too, buffs can easily be used to "cheat" in a duel situation;
simply get your buddies to buff you to the gills before you
go anywhere near the fight; even if you aren't buffable
once the battle is engaged, you are certainly capable of
being turned into a HP/AC/Manaflow/speed and stat
freak of epic proportions -before- offering the duel.  This
can be a fine line... is a cleric who self buffs and then meds
to full before the fight cheating?  How about a Mage who
summons a pet?  This stuff should be agreed on beforehand
if the duel is to be truely honorable... if you go in for that
sort of thing.
