I recently acquired a Centi Warspear and have begun to train my lvl 40 Pal
to use it.  After investing training points in it and fighting maybe a dozen
or more blues and light blues I have seen no advance in skill point in
piercing.  I asked a guide about whether you could advance skill against
light blues and he said anything thing that gave xp would give skill.  My
question is, is the centi warspear bugged, I notice when I use it with a hot
key the key does not depress even though I do damage to my opponent.  Also
since it is 2hp does this have something to do with the problem I am having,
for instance if 2hp itself bugged?  Any information you can supply on this
matter will be appreciated, especially from anyone who has either advanced
skill with this weapon or the Messanger of the Queen which I understand is
also a 2hp weapon.
