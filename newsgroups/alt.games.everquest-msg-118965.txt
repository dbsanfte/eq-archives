IMO, no the problem is more than likely a synchronization issue, which could
be:
1)    EQ data slow, you're ok
2)    EQ data ok, you're slow
3)    EQ data slow, you're slow

Pingers generally would generally let the receiving network know you where
alive, but would not solve a synchronization issue. This was a great
solution for AOL when they'd kick you offline when you where logged in, but
not using AOL network services (remember AirWarrior?).

EQ attempts to aggresivesly keep synchronization, and the way I understand
it, it tries for 30 seconds before you go LD.
