what's the death penalty in eq1? you go to the bank, grab some plat,
go to the guild lobby, buy a summon, wait around for a rez

you think that's fun?

does that improve your immersiveness in the game? do you sit and
roleplay praying at the altar for your corpse to be returned to you?

in eq1 you lose a little xp...in eq2 you have to gain a little extra
xp to hit the next level ... i like eq1's approach better, honestly,
but how often do you die and lose a level? it's happened to me twice
in 7 years and probably 500 levels spread across my accounts and
career, and it didn't make dying *those* two times feel any more
potent or punishing

> 2)One can flee from monsters,they stop chasing after a short distance.

fair enough, that's ridiculous ... it bothers me, but it it's also
silly that an npc will chase you far and wide, except across a
zoneline ... so if running away really is a viable survival tactic,
does it make more sense that you have to reach a specific point where
you zone into another place, rather than just getting a set distance
away?

both games are stupid in that regard, IMO

> 3)Any class can solo almost anything.

i don't have the facts to go through that ... in eq2, more classes can
solo and can solo more easily, but as an enchanter, i've found i could
solo anything at any level (hee hee)

on tanks, it's really hard to solo with the gear the game gives you at
your level (without twinking) in eq2 just as it is in eq1, except that
eq2 has a "mini ding" that completely heals power/health everytime
your xp reaches a new decade of your present level (10%, 20%, etc)

> 4)Any class can easily solo its way to max level/AA.

i'll concede it's easier to solo in eq2 than eq1, but it's not WoW or
even close to such illusory difficulty

there are tons and tons and tons of scripted battles and traps and
tricks that were always missing from eq1 with the exception of high-
end raid scenarios

in my experience - a handful of mid-30's alts in eq2 and a handful of
65+ toons in eq1 - there's more challenge and reward in eq2 as there
is nowadays in eq1

(note that i haven't played eq1 since october 07)

but you can't really afford it, and if you're twinking then you're
twinking and that's the game

your point here doesn't bear specifically on eq2 as compared with eq1,
except that i think the high end eq2 scene involves tradeskilled stuff
in greater presence than eq1

it's like how plants can only grow as big as the pot they're in, or
some other parallel analogue

i totally agree that those folks sound hella lame ... i remember when
a fear (or even VT, though for less fun reasons) raid was a 2-day
affair, when the goblin lord could take 40 hours, when weeks were
spent on quillmane and when raster in guk was nonexistant, the ancient
cyclops taking 10 hours ... one of my best camping memories was 11
hours for, of all pointless things, the goblin that dropped the skull-
shaped earring (you could spam click it and look like you were on
fire)

ok, sorry, self-indulgent rant over...

i admit i enjoy eq2 mostly as an improved eq1, but wouldn't play it on
my own if my friends didn't move to it

are you sure you just aren't rationalizing eq1 over eq2 because you
don't have a good enough rig to run it?

just checking ^_^
