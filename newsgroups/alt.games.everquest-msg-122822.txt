I recently lent my Jboots to a friend of mine just starting out in the game.
In getting them back, he accidentaly have them to my familiar.  I was a
little depressed, to say the least.  I petitioned to a GM and 6 hours later,
he appeared and got my boots back after some verification.  I was a happy
camper even if I had to wait that long.  Just to let you guys know, there is
hope if you lose something.  I wasn't expecting it to be recovered but was
pleasantly surprised with the result.  So, be very, very careful when
trading items.

I think it will be a long time before anyone borrows my Jboots, if at all.
