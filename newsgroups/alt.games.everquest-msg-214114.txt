I've always kept gate up, even on raids, with my magician.  It basically
came down to I didn't have any need to have that slot available for anything
else.  That's mostly due to the class, though, as my cleric generally
doesn't keep gate memmed because I need all 8 spell slots (and about 3 more
would come in handy).

Gate saved me a couple times long long ago when I lost connection in Hate or
Fear and couldn't get back on til the next day.  :)
