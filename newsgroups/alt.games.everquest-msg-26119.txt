If your character returns to the game after on a month's
absence and doesn't get any tells saying, "dude, where have
you been!", you must be incredibly anti-social.

My wife popped into the game with her 45 Ranger after being
away for over THREE months (health problems had kept her away),
and she was bombarded with tells.

So sorry *you* haven't made any real friends after playing
for 60 levels...
