SHOWEQ has been out for at least a couple of years now.  I myself have
thought about using it but have not spent the time to set it up.  This
article seems to be implying that there is this new thing called SHOWEQ that
is going to bring about the downfall of Everquest.  What a bunch of BS.  The
only REAL advantage that this program gives a person is when it comes to
tracking rare mobs.  Frankly, while playing my mage I have sometimes wanted
to use SHOWEQ to help me track down the Pegasus in SK.  Tracking these rare
mobs down is the only real reason I could see the worth of using SHOWEQ.
With the new GUI you can download a skin that will show the percentages on
your health, mana, EXP, Monster's health and party member's health.  When
all we had were bars SHOWEQ would help in determining how much EXP you could
expect from a mob and give you an approximation of how many of one kind of
monster you would need to kill to level.  Now you can just see how many
percentage points a mobs moves your exp and get a good estimate on your own
about how many kills are needed to level.

There are plenty of new MMORPG coming out but Everquest has such a rich
world and history to it that I am pretty confident that she will still be
around for several more years.  The coolest thing after the servers begin to
go black would be for SONY to release the Everquest SERVER edition where you
could run a server from your house and host games.
