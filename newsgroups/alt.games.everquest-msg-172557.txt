Sacrifice is extremely fun.  I did alot of research into the game and found
no one saying anything bad about it.  You'll enjoy the game, but overall it
isn't extremely long, and you could play it thru using different methods
once or twice.  Although this is even more fun online with live opponents,
it would be something to give a whirl instead of EQ.  Its also been out for
several years, so its in the bargain bins / ebayer buying area.  bought mine
for like $10 on ebay.  Of course, DL and apply the patch.
This isn't going to take up all your 3 months of time though unless your not
spending much time gaming.
