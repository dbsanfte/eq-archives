You are apparently unaware of the obscene hit point bonuses Warriors get 
from their Stamina.  Rangers, Monks, Rogues, Bards, Shadowknights, 
Paladins, etc, don't hold a candle compared to a Warrior for tanking.  That 
is what separates the Warriors from the rest.

Atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-
perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
