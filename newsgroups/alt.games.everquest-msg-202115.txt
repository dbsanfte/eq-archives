well, you COULD put any card you want in there, but the processor would then
be the bottleneck.  It wouldn't be able to feed the card enough info and
therefore you'd be wasting the power of that card.  but for that system, I
wouldn't recommend any more power on the video.  a GF3 will *definitely* run
Kunark and velious and will blow the 8MB ATI out of the water.
