Like Lanella said...

Fordi vi kan. (Because we can.)

(More seriously, sometimes a person resorting to usenet for an answer
doesn't know English and doesn't have an appropriate group to ask from
his country, so he asks in a language he understands and hopes
someone will understand. Or, it's a matter that only pertains to
people in that country, so if you can't understand it, it wasn't your
business anyway.)
