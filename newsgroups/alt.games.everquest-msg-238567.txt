So you have never died then? Have had plenty of close fights, nothing to do
with bad play. I have +1100 raw hp (this is nothing compared to the ubers
:) ), this saves clerics mana, and gives me a larger buffer when tanking.
Would say its more like boring play means you will never die, and hit points
wont matter (always fighting something much weaker, always singles etc etc).
And yes this does apply to experience groups. Also as I said, none of the
other stats make much difference.
