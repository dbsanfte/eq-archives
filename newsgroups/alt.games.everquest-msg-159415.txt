Not having reached a level with my Druid where I could try
this, I am curious about what you claim here.  When I Root/DoT
mobs I spend well over half the time I have a mob "engaged"
medding.  In fact, I am only standing while pulling, casting,
or dealing with a premature root failure.  When quadding,
OTOH, you are on your feet much of the time, collecting the
mobs, gaining room to cast, and waiting out refresh time on the
nuke (or is refresh so short it doesn't matter?), are you not?
So the med efficiency of Root Dotting would seem to mitigate at
least part of the dmg/mana efficiency of the 4 target nukes.
That is, it seems to me that the 15/25 comparison you give above
can't be an exact reflection of the time it takes to get your
kills since quadding is going to involve a slower net mana regen
rate, or so it looks from here.  This would seem to be even more
significant when there is competition for spawns, when I'd think
it'd be quicker getting one or two to rot than four to kite.

Kaev <--- who also wants to know why quadding seems to be almost
always a solo endeavor, why aren't those Druids who find themselves
a little short in the mana pool department pairing up?
