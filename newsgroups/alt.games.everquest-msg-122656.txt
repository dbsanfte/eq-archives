Thank you for the response Valien.  I'm actually considering a GeForce 4
Ti4600 Atm.  I just didn't want to shell out the 350.00 until I got a little
feedback from fellow EQ gamers.   I found out my processor is actually
933mhz not that that makes any difference.  I actually upgraded to this
system just before Luclin came out.  I went off of their recommended system
at the time, which was a big mistake.

I couldn't even run Luclin on my old P2 400 and now I can run it but I have
to turn down the clip plane to get rid of the choppiness.  Hopefully system
requirements won't increase again when the planes expansion comes out.
