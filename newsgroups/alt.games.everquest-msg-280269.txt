I'll play. Yes you do.

I don't know the legal particulars regarding their possible recourse, but 
whether they made you pay or not, you did owe the money.

Were you aware that the rate was increasing in June? If so, you owe the 
money.

Did you cancel your account before the rate hike, yet still get billed? If 
you didn't cancel and knew about it, then you owe the money.

Legality doesn't always reflect what's right and wrong from a moral and 
ethical standpoint.

You owe the money.
