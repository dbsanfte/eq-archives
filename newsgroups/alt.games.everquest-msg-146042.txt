I have a reasonably tough system, 760 meg 1.4 gig, geforce 4 mmx blah blah
blah. I play morrowind, it has no problems, i play eq, it crashes to
desktop, eq tech support tells me it's my system, and i just don't buy it.
No way morrowind is less demanding than eq, and my system crashes in the old
world as easily as the new. I play lots of 3d games, have powerful fans, etc
etc so it's not heat and i don't see why it's the drivers; in the end it's
eq's bugginess and the fact that verant doesn't care if it crashes badly for
10 % of it's customer base when the other 90% make them rich.

Years ago when i first started, i might leave my pc on so i could just walk
in and start playing without worrying about logging on... can'
t do it any more. I'd say their quality control has slipped.

And yes i have latest drivers, have formatted pc etcetcetc!
