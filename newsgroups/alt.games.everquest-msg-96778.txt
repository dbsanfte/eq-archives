I can't say I always agree with your opinions Jazz, but I do think
you've nailed this one.  It'll be a damned shame if they take out
all of those often annoying quirks that were actually a big part of
EQ's identity and appeal.

It looks like the change set you mentioned (which would greatly
reduce the play difficulty 1 thru 45) is aimed at making EQ more like
DAoC, in the sense of having a fairly easy path to get to the
"end-game".  IMO this is a big mistake, remember "New Coke" (for any
that don't it was essentially imitation Pepsi and was a huge flop)?

Of course, "we" (the player base taken as a whole) have contributed
to this as well, with "our" insistence on twinking, "our" PLing to 60
in 72 hours played (is this one really true?), "our" incessant whining
(or whinging if you're on the east side of the puddle) about any
inconvenience however brief or unimportant, and etc.

An awful lot of "us" have seemingly never bought into TheVision(tm),
never realizing that it (the vision) was/is the key to making EQ the
great game it _still_ is.  I hope the doomsaying is wrong, sadly I
suspect it is not. :(
