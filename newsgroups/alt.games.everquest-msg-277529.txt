Sounds like an incident I had during the last lot of fabled spawnings.
I brought a group of 4 65's down to kill the fabled ishva mal so we could 
get his robe for a couple of us.
There was a guy on his own, in his 50's camped outside the room, who couldnt 
kill the IM by himself
, yet got quite upset that we were going to "leapfrog" him. He figured it 
was "his turn" and we should party up and get him his robe first.

Oh well, we got ours first, but we did stick around after and get him a robe 
too, which I considered beyond the call of duty.
