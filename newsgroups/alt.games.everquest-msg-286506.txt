	Well, I still play at least an hour a day.  I've never been
much into raiding and mostly just see how far I can solo my main (75
necro).  So the current dearth of pickup groups doesn't bother me much.
Although I've given some thought to moving a few alts to a second
account so I can rez them.

	What can I say?  It's still fun for me, and I get to complain
about Sony's customer service on Usenet.  Can't beat that with a copper
hammer of striking.
