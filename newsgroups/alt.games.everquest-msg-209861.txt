Ok, epic question...I finally got around to starting the epic, and
everything was going okay, up until the part with Alrik Farsight.

I can't get him to talk to me, so two questions:

1) I read the part about fixing faction with him by giving batwings to Niola
Impholder.  I've given her about 300 batwings, and still apprehensive to me.
What am I doing wrong here?

2) How did I ruin faction with Alrik?  I've never killed any high elves, and
for the most part I only  kill things that attack me first.

TIA for your input
