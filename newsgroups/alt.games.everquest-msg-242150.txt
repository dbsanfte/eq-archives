That's cute.  I almost did the same thing myself with my L26 cleric
when I came back.  You see, when I quit the game in 2000 (I
think--shortly before SoV was released), there WEREN'T any rezzes
below L29 for a cleric to get. So when I restarted in 2003 after
seeing most of the "Vision" having been kicked to the curb, why would
I expect them to be added in now? I just dusted off my old spell lists
and kept on playing.

For whatever reason, the need for a rez didn't come up until I had hit
castersrealm and found out there were some new spells out there.  Yay!
A rez I could cast right away!

Anyways, there's perfectly valid reasons why someone might not have
the spells.
