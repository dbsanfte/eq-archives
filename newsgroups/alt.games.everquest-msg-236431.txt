Im looking for a guild thats interested in having fun over being too
serious about the game. Im much more interested in exploring and doing
different things instead of the same camp every day.  I play some days
at odd hours because of work (lots of hours in my days off) so
hopefully this wont be a problem.  So far I have a lvl 14 cleric and
have played about 25 gours my first 4 days.  ive found the people
mostly to be generous and very helpfull. Looking for a guild with the
same values.
