Levels and AA points simply indicate that a person has devoted a LOT
of time to their character(s). It doesn't mean they are a good player,
or even a decent human being. It is ok to respect the time commitment,
but don't let a tilte fool you into being tricked, scammed, or screwed
over by a high level character. Jerks can be any level. Sadly many
characters are sold/traded and it is possible that the level 51-65
standing in front of you is being played by someone with little or no
time investment at all in the character.
