Basically "mez" is Mesmerize line of spells that enchanters have. It stuns
the mob for a set period of time during which the mob does nothing but stand
there. Kinda like stun. EXCEPT that when you attack a stun he just stands
there. When you attack a 'Mez' it breaks the mez and the mob starts
attacking again. When a tank pulls more than one mob, and you have an
enchnater in the group (of proper level to even have mez and skill to use
the mez) he can freeze the extra mobs so that the tanks/melee can all focus
on one mob.
