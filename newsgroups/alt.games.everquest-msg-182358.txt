Sorry, but I have to disagree with you there. The number of mobs in the 
bandit camps is obviously meant to be more than one group can handle. 
Just because a group may be twinked enough to keep an entire camp clear 
doesn't mean that no one else should expect them to share. I'm not 
against twinking by any means. I do it myself - shamelessly sometimes. :) 
However, when I do, I don't expect others to grant me special 
dispensation on level-appropriate encounters to ensure a maximum xp 
earnings rate for me.

I'm not familiar with PoV, but I would imagine that if you couldn't keep 
up with the spawns well enough to prevent anyone else from pulling any, 
you wouldn't have much to complain about. If you could, well then there 
wouldn't be any reason for them to be there.
