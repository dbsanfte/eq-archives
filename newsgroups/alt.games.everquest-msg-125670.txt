Does anyone else have problems hearing the music in EQ? I had a SB Live card
and the music was choppy. I heard about problems with SB cards and EQ, so I
changed to another SB live Value card and it work great. I have since put
the SB cards in other computers and am using my on-board sound with my new
computer and have the same music problems.

I tried the old SB live value card and the music is still screwed up - this
is after a fesh install of windows XP and EQ and i have ALL of the latest
drivers for all of my hardware - MB, sound, video, etc...

Is there a known problem with the music on different platforms that I
haven't heard of?


HELP!
