Kaesora is crowded half the time on Stromm, Xalgoz is camped at least
16 hours out of every 24...  Very annoying  :/

The only tricky part is dealing with LD.  Once you've got logic in
place allowing an LD dungeon raider to rejoin, then you can require
folks to all get tagged (say a temporary PoP-style "flag") at once
and then they have xx minutes to enter "their" dungeon and xx minutes
until it despawns and boots them all to allow somebody else to have
an "adventure".  People will stil try to scam this, but the scams
should be obvious enough that the GMs can deal with the really
obnoxious jerks and they can publish policies and/or tweak the rules
to deal with the rest.  It'll take some careful thought, but they
ought to be able to have it work fairly well at the outset and very
well after a month or two live (/em crossing my fingers and knocking
on wood).
