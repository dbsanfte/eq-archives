I'm not wanting to get in on this on EITHER side, but I think a comment 
or two is in order.  

First, by simple use, the vast majority of the users of this "forum" have 
agreed that top-posting is in bad form.  I prefer neither, but my 
newsreader is setup for "bottom" posting.  

Second, the so-called "interspaced posting" is extremely important 
insofar as responding to a post that has, in and of itself, several 
different parts.  Sort of like a "question/answer" format.

Third, Ben, by your own logic (ie:  your line in your post), what *YOU* 
say is irrelevant, because, as you said "[t]his isn't a democracy."

Have I completely confused everyone on where I stand?  Let me clarify:  
Saying that one persons opinion is irrelevant, but yours is, is 
hypocritical.  I don't endorse that.  I don't disagree *IN PRINICPLE* to 
top posting, yet if the group as a whole discourages it, for what ever 
reason, THEN DON'T TOP POST.
