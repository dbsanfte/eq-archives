On a side note, quit eating my bandwidth you bastards. (site is temporarily
down due to excess bandwidth usage)

I disabled the big pictures of Cazic, so now you'll have to work at
overflowing me (they aren't even on the server anymore so don't bother.)
(if the guy who originally asked for them still needs them, email me at
bhaddick@hotmail.com and I'll ship them to you)

Feel free to copy, paste, and blatantly steal my website.
