The plus side to this is that the majority (well, slight majority. I
would guess about half) of the placeholders are those "a cyclops" which
are a far higher levl than the cyclops you find in Rathe, and at least
give good xp up into the mid forties. I made a couple yellows camping
the AC for myself and Tiru. Though, of course, after you wait six
minutes and a pirate or an aquagob show up that you thrash in three
swings, yes, it can get rather tedious.
 Oh! And a good point to mention; if you are a troll/ogre, etc. or
anyone worried about your Grobb faction, don't help on the kill when the
named Ogre pops up. He's a bad faction hit back in Grobb.
