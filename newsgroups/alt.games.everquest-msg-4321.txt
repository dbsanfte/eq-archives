Yes. The official site is http://www.everquest.com There's TONS of
information there about the various races, classes and even a mini-faq,
although it's not as in depth as the one that Teras Bulba has put
together. Go to the links area of their site to be directed to other
good EQ sites, but here's a couple to start you off:

http://eq.castersrealm.com
http://everquest.allakhazam.com

That's correct. Expect to pay anywhere from $10-$40 USD depending upon
where you buy the software, and what all you get. There are basically
three or four "versions" that you can purchase. There is the original
Everquest, the original Everquest including the Ruins of Kunark
expansion, and the Scars of Velious expansion. I have also heard of
cases where all three are sold together. Basically, though, you MUST
have the original Everquest game before you can play. All this really
gives you is a license key so that you can create an account. You will
actually be required to download additional updates when you first
attempt to log on, and can also expect to be required to download
patches every 1-2 weeks.

It could be said that, according to the date in the game, it is set in
the future. However, there really is no equivalent timeline to our
reality. This is a completely different world, so it really doesn't
matter. The weapons and technology would be considered primitive by our
standards, though. There are castles, swords, spears, etc. No laser
beams or guns. If you want to get somewhere you either run, or take a
boat, or you can find people who can teleport you. But there are no
cars, planes (in the Boeing sense of the word) or trains (in the amtrack
sense of the word). And no, you can not be a dragon. There are dragons
in the game, and after you've been playing for quite a long time you'll
actually be high enough level to kill them, with a good sized group of
others.

For me, it wasn't so much the time that it took but what I did with that
time. Ask questions. People are often very willing to help newbies with
information and point them in the right direction. Also, play the
tutorial before anything. It will familiarize you with the interface and
give you some very good information as to how to play the game. One
piece of advice, though. Don't go around begging for money or equipment.
You will start off piss poor in the game, as we all did. Just go out and
earn your money and you'll be much happier in the long run.

Hope this helps!

Brent
