Ben, despite your feelings to the contrary,  you are not deserving of
the royal plural.  You are a single individual.  The fact that you
refuse to see that you were wrong and that I have chosen to no longer
burden the group with an attempt to  help  you see that in no way
multiplies you into an us.  

That being said, your lack of logic is astounding, even when taking into
account the fact that you are perhaps being intentionally ignorant in an
effort to avoid facing your incorrect statement.  Cat does  not mean
mammal and yet cat is a mammal.  "exactly" does not mean "exclusively"
and yet when you used the term in the manner you did it defined an exact
intent on the part of the developers which by nature excludes that which
is not within your defined statement of exactness.  

I am beginning to pity you Ben, the world must be a very painful place
for you if you must go to such lengths  to assuage your feelings of
inadequacy by convincing yourself that  you are right when you are
wrong.  To go so far as to limit my point to such an obvious construct
of your own creation (I think the fancy pants folks call that a
strawman.) is about as low on the ladder of debate as you can fall. 
Still past performance on your part has led me to conclude that you will
strive to find an even lower point if at all possible.
