I know druids are better outdoors and that they're not the most desired
group members in dungeons at higher levels. But I just want some opinions on
this question: Can upper level druids at least be productive useful members
of higher level dungeon groups? I'm getting up in levels (38) and would like
to think I could at least group in upper level dungeons a little bit in the
future. Could I get some opinions please? Is there any future at all for me
in upper level dungeons?

And I'd really appreciate not turning this thread into another "bash the
druid" thread...there are plenty of those already. Thanks.
