   And where would your website be?

   I have just started a new job, so I have alot less free time on my hands (but
more money in my wallet, which is a good thing!).  So I have sorta put this on
the back burner, though I would still like to too it.  I'd happily lift and
alter someone else's code rather than writing my own if they offer it and I like
what I see.
