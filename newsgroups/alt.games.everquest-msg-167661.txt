No real tips - these were clerics in DL that either didn't have the spell 
or didn't know what it was used for.

My Blur spell isn't working that well these days ( even if I have built 
minor hate and blur them up to 3 times, they will still jump me now and 
then ), so anytime I KNOW I've built a lot of aggro on a Mezzed mob or the 
Cleric has, I ask them to atone it ( even after I mez it ).  I'll usually 
discuss this with them at some point and make a hotkey that sends them a 
tell saying "Please ATONE *[ %t ]* to clear hate".  I typically know who 
has built the most hate on each mob that we're dealing with, and if it 
looks like one that is mezzed is going to hate someone frail when mez 
drops, I'll hit my kotkey.

When they are mezzed, I can't tell if Blur totally clears the hate - they 
all do the "blink".  If it's ghetto-mezzed and I blur it, I can tell if it 
works because it will quit staring at the character it was previously 
hating.

I can't imagine a Cleric with CH not having atone or knowing what it does, 
but it happens.  I consider it a teaching opportunity instead of making 
them feel stupid.
