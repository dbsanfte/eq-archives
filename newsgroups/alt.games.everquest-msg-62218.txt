It's hard, but there ARE ways to tell female Iksars from male Iksars:

The females have that pink covering with yellow trim on their chest
and pink shorts/undies when they are naked.

Females have the bright colored face markings.

Females have three horns on their heads (males have only two).

Females have skinnier tails than males.
