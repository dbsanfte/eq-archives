Cale sucks ass. Mana to damage ratio is horrid. I'd rather use more
lower level nukes. Recast time is too long.

Yes but extra damage is damage that is 100% unresistable.
Its great for regular grind groups and you have no slower.

It only gets useless for slowed or caster mobs.

You forgot the level 5 Whirling wind one. =)
I use this one outdoors because its fast.
Great for when I am fighting those bloodtribe shaman in SD when
they start to cast gate.

Also Fury of Air level 34
250 DD and 2.5 sec stun. Works indoors or outdoors.

=)

But never as well as a level 44+ druid.
Plus we can bind in the Firepot room.

Some things maybe but druids get them with spells and not with items.

LOL! Good one.

Agreed. I think the druids only real shortfall is lack of anything much
to contribute to a raid. Many of our buffs are useless or overwritten
by shaman and Clerics. and many of our spells pale in comparison
to others or are simply resisted.

But they are still working on caster balancing so we shall see.
