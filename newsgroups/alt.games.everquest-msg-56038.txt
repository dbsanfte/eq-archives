    We have no idea how VI will decide who gets to go and who doesn't - they
may take this into consideration. Assuming they don't, and it's just a
timestamp issue.... On Quellious, the assembled Euro and Asian guilds don't
even crack our top three guilds, and the number two guild is JUST starting
NToV. Number three has just recently been able to take down Velketor with
few casualties. I seem to remember back on The Rathe when I played there
(pre-Zeb split) that no overseas guilds were top three either (it was BoTS,
KEG, CIW). So the real questions are is there enough mid-range raid content
to accomodate all these overseas guilds, and how many people can pack into
HoT at once? 8)
