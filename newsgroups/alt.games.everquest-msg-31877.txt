Dymlos - I really do understand.  I've been feeling more and more the same
way myself.  The game has been moving further away from quests and
roleplaying "atmosphere" to "the *only* way to get experience is to kill,
kill, kill."

I'm still playing because I don't believe everyone at Verant is of like mind
on the issue.  For example, there is a blight in the Karanas.  How logical
it was to make delivering food (bread) in this case give outstanding
experience?  I can't think of a service that would be much more valued for
people suffering from the bad crops.  Not trivial for lower levels, and for
mid levels, matching the experience of slaughtering things nonstop.  The
tradeoff?  Combat skills (or spellcasting skills) aren't advanced for the
level or two you do the quest.  Was it worth it?  It was a *choice* at
least.  Someone in the company thought enough of us to give us that.  Then
the inevitable "nerf...."

Perhaps I'm being a bit gullable ... Verant seems to "nerf" nearly every
other method of gaining experience and platinum other than simply slashing
and burning whatever moves.  Something about the intricacy of the game
itself makes me have to believe that there is someone behind it who has a
greater vision for Everquest.  I'm not going to be able to take much more
narrowing of the game before I'll sadly take my farewell tour, too.

There are so many beautiful things to see in the game, indeed.  I wish you
well on your final travels.  It will be sad to see you go ... someone who
expects more from Norrathian life than rote mob killing.  Safe journeys,
friend.
