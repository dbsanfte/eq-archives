I'm glad I'm not the only one that notices the mass of LD's since SoL
came out.

My guild goes to fight a boss mob and the LD's start popping. 3 out of
my group went LD as soon as we started to attack and my screen shot
shows tons of LD's in the zone.

Outrageous if you ask me.. Frustrating to say the least.

I tried DAoC but a guide pissed me off by being so rude and I canceled
immediately. Other wise it was a pretty cool game.
EQ could take a few lessons from them.

I never went LD.
I got some lag in cities but not too bad.
I liked that you couldnt "Twink" out a player
I regened mana and health faster cutting down on wasted time medding
and junk.
I loved not having to buy spells and research pages and all that junk
I liked the multiple choices you had for specializing your char.
RvR was the MOST fun.
