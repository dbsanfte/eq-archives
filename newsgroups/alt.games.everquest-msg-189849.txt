Ok, I've got to step back in, here.  The North Korea argument is possibly
the biggest Red Herring I've seen in my life.  Yes, we realize that there is
no oil in North Korea.  However, that has absolutely no play in why we
aren't attacking them.  North Korea is a nuclear nation.  We aren't invading
NK for the same reason we're not invading China, and we didn't invade the
U.S.S.R.  Going into NK would be the most irresponsible act Dubya could even
concieve of conducting.  South Korea and Japan would pay a heavy toll for
our poor judgement.  I'm kind of fond of Japan, and don't really want to see
them nuked again.  Attacking North Korea simply is -not- an option.
