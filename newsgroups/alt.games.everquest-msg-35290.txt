This is one place where VI should put thier famously twisted sense of humor to
work. If you get fairly drunk, but not to the point of losing navigation, you
should get a few extra strenth points, but get weird side effects. For instance, a
"Beer Muscles" icon that shows up like a curse or DOT on you.  Tenth level player
cons a hill giant, and gets a green message saying, "A Hill Giant greets you warmly
and offers you a tasety beverage. You could easily defeat this opponent."
