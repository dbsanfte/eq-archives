As a weapon, the cleric epic is lame for anyone level 56 plus; at that point we
can buy a spell to summon a hammer that puts every weapon I've ever seen to
shame... and then there are dropped versions of the spell that work even better
available as you level up further.

As something to hold in your hand when your melee output isn't an issue, though,
its going to be quite a while longer before this is a useless item, it has nice
saves, nice stats, nice HP and nice mana.

Even if you do end up holding something else all the time, though, the clickable
effect is useful enough that you will carry this thing in your backpack
constantly; the ability to casually rez people with just a click and a few
seconds of your time is great on a day to day basis, the ability to rez people
en masse after a big wipeout at top speed and regardless of your own mana status
is even better, and the ability to rez dead people right in the middle of a
battle if you can find the time between pushing out heals can mean the
difference between success and failure... with the epic you can do this without
sacrificing a spell slot and without any mana worries.

As you level up, it will be expected that you have your epic, rather than a
pleasant surprise for people.

All that said, not, its not worth it.   Not worth the KS fest that I've heard of
on some servers, surely not worth sitting in a waiting list for over a year as I
saw on the MT server.  Fortunately, changes to the epic eliminated this wait,
changing the cleric epic from one of the five most difficult to one of the five
easiest.  Now for little more effort and time spent than the rogue or beastlord
epic, you too can have this little badge that says "I'm a real cleric"

It doesn't really command much respect anymore, but you will get derision for
not having spent the three or four days it takes to get it if you don't bother!
