It's an altitude thing.  For some reason, you can see mobs
in a valley 200 feet below you, but you can't see PC's that
are standing next to them -- or even just slightly uphill/downhill
from you.

There's one place in the King room in Permafrost where I was
playing with this "feature".  There's a small ramp near where
the King spawns.  40+ people were hanging around on the floor
waiting for a Vox raid, and by just going up and down the
little ramp a bit (no more than 20 "feet" high) I could
make all 40+ people simultaneously blink into or out of
"existence" at will, despite the fact that they were all
very close to me on the X/Y axis.

It was eerie, and totally repeatable.
