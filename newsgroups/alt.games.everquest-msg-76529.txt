Swarm kiting is the bardic equivilant of quad-kiting, in fact some bards 
have even started referring to it as quad kiting.  You have to find mobs 
of the same type that spawn close together, assist each other, and don't 
cast.  Well, they can be casters, but it's easier if they're not, but I 
discovered this trick on Specs in Oasis, so it's possible with casters.  
Anyway, you run in with selos up and a drum equiped, target one mob, start 
the charm song, and run away very fast.  As soon as charm hits, turn 
around, hit f8 to pick the nearest non-charmed mob, and then hit you /pet 
attack hotkey.  If you're far enough away, all the mobs should attack your 
pet.  Watch your pet's health closely, and when he's down below one 
bubble, don't re-charm him, either charm another one, or just chant-kite 
your former pet to death.  Rinse and repeat.  You will probably only have 
to recharm your first pet once, your second pet a couple times, and the 
remaining ones almost as if you're just doing regular charm-fighting.  
This is a very risky trick, but it's the fastest way I've ever seen to 
gain experience.  At 32 I'm not sure where you would find the right mobs 
to try this with, maybe the gnoll spires in SK if it's off hours.  
The classic place to do this is the wyverns in Cobalt Scar, especially the 
bunch in the tower.  A friend got through 51 in a couple sessions doing 
the tower, and during off-hours was able to take out about 1/2 the other 
wyverns in CS.  (Being level 45 and having Singing Steel Boots helps a ton 
in CS, since you can lev and just kite over the water.
