There is, but it's practically seamless, and I've only rarely seen a loading 
screen.  Even then it's usually so quick as to be almost inconsequential.

A very nice thing is that it's almost always less than a minute--a lot of 
the time *way* less--from the time I click the WoW icon on my desktop until 
I'm actually *in* the game.
