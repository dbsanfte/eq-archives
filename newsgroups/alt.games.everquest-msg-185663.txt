Now that Grobb has been taken over and trolls are forced to hide out in 
Neriak, is there any hope in the trolls getting a new city in the 
future?  I heard the next expansion pack might even give a new "troll 
continent".  It seems that now there are barely any newbie troll quests.

Also, why does Verant not fix out 2-handed slashing animation?  
Currently the luclin graphics show trolls as using their 2-handed 
slashing weapons using just one hand.  Yuck.  Or has this been fixed 
lately, because I see the new welcoming graphic has a troll fighting a 
frog and he is certainly holding his 2HS weapon correctly with two hands 
in that graphic; odd, because I thought it was still broken.

Another thing that gets on my nerves it that the troll NPCS for the most 
part are depicted using the old pre-luclin models even if you have the 
luclin expansion.  This continues even in the Neriak NPCs.

Where is the troll cultural forge currently located?

Wish they would give us some cultural armors in the next expansion; 
preferably something with a bit of regenerative powers, since that is 
what trolls are reknowned for and currently at high levels regeneration 
is barely even perceptible.  Why have the fire resistance penalty if our 
regeneration is no better than a lizard; those lizards certainly have no 
fire resistance penalty even though we all know lizards in real life 
will cook to death if they sit too long out in the summer sun (their 
blood overheats).

Sure is depressing being a troll lately.
