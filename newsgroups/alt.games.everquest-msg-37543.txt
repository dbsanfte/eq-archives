I can see several reasons for doing this.

1. This is information that can be of use to competitors.  Knowing how many
people are on, and when, is valuable.

2. People screaming for server splits.  "My server had 2600 people on last
night!  Split now!"  It's a psychological thing.  If you don't see the
numbers, then you won't think the server is overcrowded.  Plus, the world is
larger now than it was in release.  2600 people now is nothing compared to
2600 people pre-Kunark.

3. Declining membership.  It may not be happening much now, but as time
passes, there will be more games competing for your MMOG dollar.  This will
be reflected in the server population numbers, which is understandably
something that they don't want people commenting about.
