Sorry if this is a goofy post, but I actually had a dream the other
night that I was waiting for a bus, but apparently I was a Wood Elf
Ranger and there were a bunch of griffins flying around near the bus
stop terrorizing everyone.  Fortunately I could track them so I knew
where there were and could warn other people, and I could also hide,
so I managed to avoid having them attacking me, but it was
nervewracking having them fly by me and having to stand still hoping
my hide was working and I was really getting annoyed and wishing the
bus would hurry up and come (maybe I should have asked if there were
any porters around! ;-)  )

Anybody else ever had any EQ related dreams?
