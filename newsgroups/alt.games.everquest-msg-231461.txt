"I have had bad experiences with 'idiot' in the past, and refuse to group
with him. You may chose who leaves."

If they have a problem, well, good clerics have little trouble getting
groups. And last time I did that and was asked to leave, I was asked back
before I got picked up again (less than 5 min). And since it was all handled
politely, I even went back. (I was an enchanter btw).
