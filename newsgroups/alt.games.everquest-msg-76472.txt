He did.  When he spoke of "the Paladin", it's clearly
a reference to the 60 Paladin mentioned in the previous
sentence.

That would be a neat trick, since Paladins never get the
50% rez.  They get Revive at 49 (no exp recovery) and
then Resurrection at 59 (90% exp recovery).

And since he spoke of the Paladin "rezing" him instead
of "reviving" him, and pointed out that he'd be "undinged"
otherwise, it's entirely clear that he meant the 90% rez.

There certainly is, but that's never a choice when
being returned to your corpse by a Paladin.

On the other hand, it sure would be nice if Paladins
could get the intermediate rez (Resuscitate, 50% exp
recovery) somewhere between 49 and 59.  Clerics get
it at 39, it would hardly be unbalancing for Paladins
to get it at, say, 55.
