KEI was far greater for any of your casting characters than it was for
tradeskilling, far, far, far, far, more far and far as you can go
greater. I played a 40 sk and 42 cleric grouping together, each with
KEI before a play session started, it was just fantastic.

The small int or wis boost in for tradeskills is pretty moot really.
Whichever is the highest only increases the chance of possibly getting
a skill raise. For some tradeskills it is whichever is highest of
Int/wis/dex, such as fletching. For smithing it is highest of
str/int/wis. As a melee type you probably have higher dex or str than
int or wis anyway, even when you had kei.

There is a lot of debate on eqtraders.com as to whether or not it even
really makes that big a difference. Sure, its probably good to have
255 wisdom for tradeskills instead of 100 but is it really going to
help to have 130 instead of 100? It probably won't make a noticeable
difference.
