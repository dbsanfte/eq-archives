Hopefully someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but I think for your
monk to fight magic-only mobs, you could just get a pair of magic
gloves (e.g., splitpaw hide gloves) instead of using a magic weapon.
Your new special attack, tiger claw, is considered a magical attack
and will also work on magic-only mobs.
