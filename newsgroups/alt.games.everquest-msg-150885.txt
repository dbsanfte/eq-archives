nice story, I kept my shadowknight in the warrens all the way till 30 with a
side trip every now and then to kill the guards in paineel for cash.  I made
sure that I got every rare drop that I could.  And at 15 you are in the
sweet spot, do the kitchen, pitfighters, jailer and trainer.  They will
teach you how to play the game. hehe
