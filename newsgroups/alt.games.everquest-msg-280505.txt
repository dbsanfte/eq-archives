I'm kind of partial to the "Cheap old second computer with small, cheap
monitor next to the bigger gaming system" method, myself.

Old Pentiums (I or II), Macs (680x0 or PowerPC, as long as it has
ethernet), or other older systems (old Sun or SGI workstations work
well) are great for this purpose. The whole setup shouldn't cost over
$50, $200 if you decide to go with a small, space-efficient flat-panel
display. This also provides a convenient way to look stuff up on the
web while playing.

Xiphos - I have an UltraSPARC 5 myself for this purpose. Nice small
desktop footprint and doubles as a monitor stand.
