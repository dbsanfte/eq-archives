Certainly its possible to get just one mob if you are doing it in a
good situation.  But clerics, enchanters, rangers, druids, monks, and
shadowknights can pull singles out of pretty much -any- situation.
Walk up to the derv 2 camp in NRo and get one mob at a time out of it
when you are low enough level that they normally all aggro on you,
thats single pulling.  Walking around in Oasis, finding a mob that has
nothing nearby its social with and grabbing it, leading it back without
getting it too close to any other mobs, thats not what I mean by single
pull.

Now I'm willing to entertain ideas like "pull with cancel magic" as
partial "single pull" techniques, or even more so something I was
working on; get at max bolt range, cast bolt, and Back Up before the
bolt hits.  If I can get so far from the potential adds that they won't
come, but stay in attack range of the original mob I targetted due to
him being madder at me because of actually being hit, or because he's
the only one in attack range... well I'll give that partial marks for
single pull technique.

As an aside, I've heard that rogues can single pull by using archery
and hiding before the arrow lands; this way only the mob they hit will
get mad at them, no social adds.  True?  False?  Tricky to operate?
(I'd think much more usable when the rogue gets to where his hide/sneak
speed isn't a snare effect)

My high level characters were a bard (no focus works) a cleric (didn't
care about DD focus by the time it was introduced) and shaman (again,
DD bleh, but the new BA line is interesting for soloing).  So I was
unaware that DD boosters were as outrageously expensive as IH items.
This isn't true at lower levels where I'm currently playing, where most
everyone seems to have a DD booster if they use DD heavily, and even I
have an IH item.  Yep, played too many healers, I tend to heal my pet
instead of tank for him or nuke his troubles away, its instinct.

Aye, if the AC actually worked in your ammo slot everyone in the game
would want one (rangers would swap out their arrows whenever meleeing,
everyone else would do the same whenever not pulling).  For some reason
I can't understand, the ammo slot is unique in that items there don't
seem to give the stats listed on them.  UV is nice and all, but if you
have a night blind character you really should have a perma IR item or
better by the time your mage buddy can coldstone you (level 29), so now
all the coldstone does is allow you to use a better item in that IR
slot and have your vision in your more useless ammo slot instead.

Yep, there are a couple zones where EB is a good idea, and waterstones
are better than cast EB because they don't eat a spell slot and for non
EB casting classes, they don't rely on a second person to save your
asterisk.  But 99% of your life you don't need EB, and for the
remaining 1%, you really should have a perma EB item, they are fairly
common and reasonably cheap these days... so Kedge is about it for
waterstones, the other "need EB" places are generally high enough level
that most people have perma EB.  Cast EB, even waterstone cast, is
usually responsible for more deaths than all the mobs combined on a
kedge raid...

See?  Mages have DD focus, so they are useful to nukers, but no IH
focus so they are useless to healers.  Whats up with that?  If there
was no such thing as IH then I could see it, but the itemization exists
for it, I just don't get where mages shouldn't be able to substitute
just as well for that line.  And don't tell me its because mages know
about DD but not about healing, my alteration is higher than my
evocation and almost as high as my conjuration, and we -do- get Burning
Affliction line, while mage DOT capability comes late and fairly
useless.

Yes, I'll grant you that there -are- things I can single pull.  Why,
there are mobs my warrior could single pull, ones my shaman could
single pull... but my warrior, like my mage, is screwed if he gets
adds, and my shaman -has- CC.  My point is not that its impossible to
get singles anywhere, ever, its that there's no way to avoid multiples
in spots where you get multiples if you don't do anything special, and
no way to split multiples up so you deal with one at a time if you -do-
get them.

I once claimed earth pet root would do this job for you; I don't claim
that any longer.  His root has a very short duration, and pulling him
off a mob in order to stick him on an add is usually an exercise in
wishful thinking, as unlike Shaman pet he doesn't have SOW and unlike a
chanter he doesn't have Mez (mez is great for getting your pet off a
mob).  Usually by the time I get him on the add the original mob has
broken root and is back in the game... or more often, I'm already dead.

Rangers get slow.  Heck, warriors do too.   Paladins, I'd be amazed if
they don't have access to slow proccing weapons by that level.  Of
course by the time its vital, proc slow is useless as you'll be dead
before it happens to go off... but for exp grind soloing mobs its
workable, these aren't the mobs that kill you if they are allowed to
hit twice as fast for a while.  Druids, why would they care, they play
a no contact game anyway. But I'm not saying everyone should have every
ability, I'm asking where it is that mages shine to make up for the
deficit; Slow is a vastly important spell line as you go up in levels,
unless you are prepared to kill things without letting them hit you.
My bard could care less about the fact that his Slow line sucks eggs,
because he doesn't have to touch the mobs anyway... but he -does- have
slow of sorts and could melee happily if only bard melee was any better
than mage melee.

PS just spent five hours last night getting rid of the
Win32.blaster.worm on my machine.  Funny thing, it shuts down your
computer after its been running a few minutes.  And the fix involves
downloading a couple files that take more than a couple minutes to
download, and then running them, but they take more than a couple
minutes to run.  SO my advice is, go download the patch that closes the
gap in your security if you are using any version of windows, and then
the one that removes any instances of the worm you may already have (I
apparantly had it for over a week without knowing it, as the "crash"
looked like a usual sort of crash I get sometimes anyway, I didn't
realize it was the worm till the frequency got high).  Actual time
wasted about 15 minutes on dialup, but took me hours and hours because
the worm itself was making things more interesting.
