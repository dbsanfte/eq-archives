Level 20............
p/u groups at aviak town in SK. (watch out for the avocets, though)
EK Spider hunting groups
Hang in EK and shout for a p/u group to take into Beholder's Maze. Great at
20, though probably not the throne room yet.
Recruit a partner or two to go spend the day/evening in OoT either on the
Gargoyle Island or the neighboring goblin island.
Go to Unrest and shout LFG. As a Cleric you should be snapped up instantly
for a first floor group.
Najena. (bring friends. I hear the entrance is guarded by some nasty skellie
now.)
