================================
Pets that are on guard here or follow me will
only attack things that attack them or you.

Pets on guard me will attack nearby mobs on
principle.

Pets on sit down will return partway to their
proper spot after a fight... gradually they
will creep further and further forward, increasing
the chance that they will aggro things you weren't
ready for.  On Guard here they will return to
the exact spot, sometimes performing amazing
feats of pathing to do so, never getting stuck.
(had one follow a mob who was on someone up
from the warrior room in HHK all the way to the
zone line where the guards finally helped him kill
the offending goblin, then saunter blithely back
down all three flights of stairs around a dozen
corners right to his spot on the dime.)  More
reliable than follow me even, which will get him
lost trying that trick.  Pick a spot, park the pet,
and put him back on follow only if you -need-
to move.

/pet back off will pull your pet away from
a fight, but he will always attack if attacked.
Doing a hotkey with 5 in a row gives you a
better chance of getting him to continue
backing out of range of the offending mob.

Your pet will only "get lost" if he hears you.
Sure its a cheap and effective way to kill him
if he can... but when you most need it, he
can't hear you.  So dedicate a spell slot
to invis, and make a hotkey that will target
you and cast it as needed, quick.  Caster
going invis kills pets dead no matter where
they are in the zone... and (illogically) even
if someone casts see invis on them first.

Taunt is (except for chanter pets, who also
won't listen to any of the other stuff I mention
here except the invis angle) entirely optional
for pets.  Often they won't be your best tank,
and putting them on no taunt duty will help
save a fair amount of recasting mana and
rebuffing, rearming, and so forth.

The pet get ale thing is simply tragic, nothing
more I can say.
