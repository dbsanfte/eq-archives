    I doubt they have more than a handful of players left from the UO days.
PoP really turned over their roster, with a lot of the new recruits coming
from other servers.

    That's the thing, though. They have a lot of opportunity to exploit
because, at least in the past, they got to places first and saw what was
wrong with them. And they don't do it, or at the very least don't do it MUCH
(*cough* Furor's Luclin quest earring *cough*). I've seen the screenshots of
CiH forming an ogre wall to block a passage so they couldn't be leapfrogged,
I've read why they got kicked out of Ssra that fateful day. They do grief,
despite the possible consequences. That's why I say you can't really compare
the two.
