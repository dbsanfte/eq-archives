Dennis.... have you *ever* read Ben's most recent sig line? Do you
really think something as silly as the following definition, posted by
Absor on the official EQ boards, is going to have one ounce of impact on
this discussion? What color is the sky in your world? ;-)

For the rest of us following the show up to this point:
****************
Pure Caster means any non-hybrid, non-melee (Necromancer, Magician,
Enchanter, Wizard, Cleric, Druid and Shaman).  Int Caster are
Necromancers, Magicians, Enchanters and Wizards. Wis Casters (or
Priests) are Clerics, Druids and Shamans. Hybrids are Bards (though they
will probably have to be considered separately for most things),
Rangers, Paladins, Shadowknights and Beastlords. Melee are Monks, Rogues
and Warriors.
Alan
****************

Enjoy. God DAMN, but I simply *KNEW* I read that someplace. I couldn't
have dug it up on short notice, though. Thanks.
