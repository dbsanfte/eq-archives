Still, when you are KOS, people might say, as it seemed he did, that
those MOBs hate you.  I tend not to just write "KOS", but telling
someone it is wrong to say that is a bit anal.  The mob does hate you
after all.  It wants you dead...

He was asking what aggro/hate was based on.  Once you are fighting
something your hate level and your aggro is based on what kind of
damage you are doing, your heals, etc...  It has little or nothing to
do with your faction.  Getting aggro by being too close can have
*everything* to do with your faction.  That is why you have to make
sure we understand that aggro can mean both a monster deciding to
attack but it can also mean a monster deciding what its priorities
are.

When someone wants to know what aggro is based on, you *have* to make
sure and identify what he means by "aggro".
