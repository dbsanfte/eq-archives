This may explain the Screenie I took a couple of days back, a druid appeared
to be kiting 8 othmirs...I maybe out on the number, I'll double check the
the shots I took but there were definitely more than 5 there.
Quite a sight, especially when I thought you couldn't hold aggro on more
than 4 mobs, the 5th normally wandering off <shrug>
