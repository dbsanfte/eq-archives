I just upgraded to Windows XP. I can play EQ. It worked the first time, and
plays really everytime. the problem I have is my Audio. I have a
soundblaster live card. I downloaded the patch, it didn't seem to help? I
can play. the sounds are fine, but the music is hammered bad. It skipps,
studders, crackles, and is over all unacceptable. Has anyone else had this
problem. I concidered re-installing EQ, but don't want to go that route
unless I have to. Creative.com don't seem to have a lot. CD's play, wav
files, and MP3's all play fine. So, if anyone has any suggestions I want to
please hear what you got..
