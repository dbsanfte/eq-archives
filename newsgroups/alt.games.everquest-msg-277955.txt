I gave away all my plat (which was a fair chunk, I had been saving for
a while) to a few friends.  Left my chars in place, on the offchance I
might someday reactivate.   Gave away a little gear, but most of it
wasn't great stuff.  Logged on my very first char and walked him back
to my starting point (Kelethin) with a friend.  Looked around,
realized the magic was gone, and logged.

Seemed like a good way to leave.
