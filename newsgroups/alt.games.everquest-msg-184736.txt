Unfortunately my problem is a little more widespread, yes I crash at bazaar
but also when zoning do I crash to desktop.  It seems this started for me
when LoY patches first started as never had a problem before.  I also see
many people bitching on msg brds and chat so not just you and me.  I have
talked with eqtech 2x now and each time they nice but not helpful.  Some
things they had me do were changed data rate, delete eqclient.ini files and
repatch, remove old world textures and reload em, I have deleted EQ entirely
and reloaded and have formatted hard drive and re-installed EQ.  So you can
try some of those options if you wish but I still crash. I also logged my
char on a buddies puter with different isp and still crashed so now out of
options except for their side.  Good luck.
