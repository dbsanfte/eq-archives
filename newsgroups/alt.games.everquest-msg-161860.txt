Of course, the funny thing about that is, "potatoe" is a perfectly correct,
if quite antiquated spelling of potato.  My aunt has alot of old
dictionaries laying around (she's a teacher), so I looked it up in one that
was published in 1912, and it listed it as an alternate spelling.

Of course, of course.

Be fair to Dubya.  We had just been attacked by _someone_ (despite Katie
Couric's inability to figure it out, most of the people at work understood
IMMEDIATELY what was going on), and he's the POTUS.  It's his responsiblity
to get to safety.  This is real life, and he's not Capt. Kirk.  I tend to
view poeple who blame him for being just a tad bit inaccessable as being
just a tad clueless about national security.  Also, I'm sure the Secret
Service didn't exactly give him the option.
