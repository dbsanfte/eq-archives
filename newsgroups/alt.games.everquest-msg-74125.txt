how many times have people died from fizzles?  seems like fizzle rates
aren't high enough to warrant much concern.

another worthless spell or two to waste plat / waste spell book space?

still feel stupid about buying a spell where I was thinking I would have a
sort of complete spell book, in that it has some worthless pet effect for
immediate summons.
has utterly no effect on charmed critters.  : (  no wonder I had avoided it
for awhile.  really how many spells do you really use, given the fact you
gotta siphon thru a stiffling 8 spell slots.  Even normal debuffing is a
pain.
