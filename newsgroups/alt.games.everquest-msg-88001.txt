You will still have to download patches from time to time, but it will
get *much* better after this first one. Downloading the regular patches
normally doesn't take more than a few minutes, although when they come
out with expansion packs they can be pretty nasty. Wouldn't worry about
that though, I think it will be quite a while before they release
another one. Just remember, you are downloading several *years* worth of
patches the first time you load it after a new install. Once you have it
all, if you have a CD burner, it's a good idea to burn the entire EQ
directory to disk (takes 3 CDs these post-Luclin days) so that if you
have to reinstall later, you don't have to get it all off the web. Also,
today was a regular patch day, which means traffic to their patch server
was heavier than usual and may account for some of the hang up problems
you're having. Bad news is that there is no other way to get the
patches, unless you have a friend who already has them downloaded and
burned onto CD, in which case you can borrow his/her disks and just copy
them into your EQ directory.
