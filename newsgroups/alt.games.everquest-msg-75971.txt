For those of you that are here to see how you can do this...Sorry,
thats not what this post is about.
I was at the freeport gate waiting for a friend to show when I heard
this guy /shout " Hey, want to know how to Lvl to 45+ in minutes?"
So being a curious cat I went over to this Lvl 1 charater to see what
his ploy was.
He said his dad worked for Verant. A Mr. Phil Baron. and that he
progammed part of the program.
And this is what you do:

send a email to 

EQCharaRec@hotmail.com

In first line write your Account Name
3rd line your Password
5th line your server.

And you'll get a bot that has all your character info which you can
then edit and send back.

HAHAHAHA, I walk away from this scammer LMAO , I then promptly
/petition GM and found out I wasn't the only one petitioning on the
guy.

Sad thing is there is probably some newbie that gave him info.
