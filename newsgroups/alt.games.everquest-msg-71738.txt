Windows has problems with memory addressing when you have more than 512MB
RAM.
Microshits solutions are to

1-Remove your extra RAM!!!!

2. Do this.

Open the System.ini file in a text editor, such as Microsoft Windows
Notepad.
Go to the [VCache] section.
Change the MinFileCache= and the MaxFileCache= settings to the desired
value.
NOTE: The value for these settings are in kilobytes. For example, if you
want to create a 50-MB cache that cannot exceed 55 MB, the lines would be as
follows:
  1..       [VCache]
      MinFileCache=51200
      MaxFileCache=56320
Please note that Microsoft's testing did not include cache sizes greater
than 40MB. Microsoft makes no guarantees that the cache size will operate
correctly when increased above the user interface. Microsoft is not
responsible for data loss or data corruption due to a cache size larger than
the user interface.

I think I read that you set the numbers to equal 25% of your RAM. Windows
will use this 25%, the other 75% will be used by applications.
