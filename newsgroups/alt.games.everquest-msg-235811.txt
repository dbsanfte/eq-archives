The OS isn't worth doing. 

Based on my vague recollections of what you said you have, the old
motherboard isn't too likely to support plug and play etc in quite the
same way. XP in particular is a pita to switch from "Standard PC" to
"ACPI PC" (Some mobos support both 'modes'. And if you switch the bios
setting, the official solution from MS, last I heard, was to reinstall
windows. I assume this would apply if you swap the whole motherboard
too.

If you'd like to check Go into device manager, into the "computer". If
it says something like "Standard PC" don't bother trying to migrate;
even if it works it will be suboptimal. If it says ACPI uniprocessor
(or multiprocessor if you happen to be running a modern dual board or
an HT compatible P4)... it *might* be doable...  but you're still
probably farther ahead with a clean install.

Master, Slave, or Cable Select "the Auto". 

Lately I prefer Cable Select. (If you plug it into the end of your
cable its the master, otherwise its not. all drives have to be on CS
for it to work. Its saves a ton of hassles. Although it didn't work
reliably on older mobos its pretty solid now.

Good luck,
