Oh not denying it, I like the idea of the story line I just would have
preferred them to use the Warrens looting rule where if  you can't gain
experience from the mob then you don't get it's loot. I know I was there way
above level but I was really there to look around, I did exactly the same in
the Warrens, learnt that the top mobs there will aggro anything, which was
annoying as I had no intention of killing them. As for being tougher, this
was my opinion from being in there at 43rd I was often faced with many mobs
(and one charmed paladin) that were capable of dealing me plenty of damage
and eventually ran into the Battlewizard while I was under half health,
didn't survive that encounter.

Wonder if the splitpaws will rebel against the Tesch Mas gnolls one day.
