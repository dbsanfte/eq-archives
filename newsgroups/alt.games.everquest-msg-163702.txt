I'd say it's more of a flaw in the analysis leading to the designs.  For
every player/group who sees the wait for the boat as an opportunity to
chat or goof off, there're a whole lot more who see it as a pointless
annoyance.  This latter group includes not only the video gamers (who I
believe to make up over half the EQ player base, without the slightest
bit of hard evidence to back me up), but lots of other folks who have
already waited for the same boat 17 times and are counting the kills
until their buddy Donnadruid hits 29.

The more interesting (to me) issues of downtime and caster/melee balance
can be attacked in lots of ways.  You can try the DAOC route and allow
non-magical attacks to dispatch opponents quickly, but how then do you
avoid the DAOC problem of the archers/assassins/nukers/mezzers playing
a rock/paper/scissors game that still leaves most of the melees next to
useless?  Personally, I like the "epic" quality to EQ battles, though
fights that involve effective Enchanter crowd control get pretty damned
boring.  I think a system similar to EQs could be designed that would
eliminate the "downtime" for casters, and also eliminate the enormous
advantage casters have soloing, without hurting the value casters bring
to groups.  For example, what if your mana pool was (stat/2) + (lvl*2)
and you were allowed to go one cast "into the hole"?  That is, if you
have mana you can cast a spell, even if that leaves you with negative
mana until you regen it.  Now you don't have a 15 minute recovery time
(the dreaded downtime), and yet you can cast the same spells over time.
Since you don't have the humongous starting mana pool extreme sit-agro
can be a very special quality on a very few NPCs, instead of a routine
aspect of high-level encounters.  Since you don't have the enormous
mana pool you don't have nearly as large an edge over a melee in your
ability to solo (and so zones/encounters that are meant to allow solo
play don't have to be made impossible for a melee in order to have
them not be trivial for a caster).  This isn't complete, pets are not
addressed, but it attacks two of the greatest annoyances in EQ, long
downtime and the ridiculous disparity in power between casters and
melees.  An alternative way to deal with the disparity issue is to
make all PCs casters and specialty melees (i.e. pre-nerf Monks) and
use pets and "henchmen" (hired pets) for grunts.  The thing all the
casters whining about downtime forget is that they have downtime
because they <choose> to burn out the enormous amount of power in a
full mana bar in a very short period of time.  I think it's safe to
say that you will always be able to depend on players to behave like
that, so don't give them the option... small mana pool gives small
downtime, make them group and or use tactics that are actually
clever.  It's pretty damned stupid that my 32 Druid can easily kill
mobs in 3 to 4 minutes that my Paladin couldn't have killed at all
at 38.
