Actually, I talked to a GM in the chatrooms. They actually have a chatroom
set up specificly for the "black box" problem. I have it too. It is the
video card. In many cases it's just the drivers of the card not supporting
the new ActiveX8.1 video. Try seeing if your current card has a driver
update while you wait for the new one.
