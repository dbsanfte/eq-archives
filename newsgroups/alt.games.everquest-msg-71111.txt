Well I knew about game just before they went beta with it...
but I was playing "The Realm"  and didn't really wanna mess with beta.

my first character I created was my ranger on 4-4-99, who is currently
51.  My mage @ 53 was created a few days later. 
Hehe.. played my mage more.
And now after multiple character creations and leveling them , then
deleting some... am still playing!!
Working on Beastlord now.
Gaaawwd.... have all  8 slots full  on Tunare and 3 on Drinal and
Bristlebane


Sooooo.... what does THAT say about MY spare time!!  ;-)
