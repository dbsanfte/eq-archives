Not sure who you're responding to, but I will say this.  The fact that
Emmanuel Kant does not believe evil exists does not make it so.  Many
philosophers line up on either side.  Contemporary babble is that there is
no evil, but I detect a bit of hedonism in such philosophies; that it, there
is no evil because to acknowledge evil would be to put reasonable
limitations on your behaviour.
