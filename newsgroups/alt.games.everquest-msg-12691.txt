LOL I agree completely!  I have sworn not to zone into Firiona Via or
Lake of Ill Manners.  

Last time I was in FV there was a level 45ish warrior at the zone
begging for help getting past the drachnids and the necro that summons
people.  I haven't been back there in 25 levels!  

There are some good zones in Kunark, but you can get to them by having a
high level guild member port you into Dreadlands.  Dreadlands is
dangerous too, but I've died every time I went to FV, and I've never yet
died in Dreadlands.  Your mileage may vary.  

> Are there any other options?

Sure.  At your level I spent some time in Unrest, but I was getting
experience so fast I had to leave because I would have outleveled
friends who didn't go there.  The zone was busy and had lots of lag
too.  Mistmoore was unusable on my server due to high level trains.  

So I went to South Karana, and also spent time on beetles in North and
West Karana.  The Gorge (AKA Beholder's Maze) can work too if you can
find a group or bring one.  Those places are all close to Highpass where
you are now.
