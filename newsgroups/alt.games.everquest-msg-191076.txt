Grrrrr ... I just wrote a huge reply to you and bloody well lost it.

I'm a 5 year vet of UO and have been into EQ for around 4 months now
and loving it. I've been reading your posts on the UO group and I know
you've become disillusioned with it like me.

Basically tradeskills royally suck in EQ compared to how they are done
in UO. There is no offline trading and doing tradeskills is extremely
click intensive.

Email me if you want know more about my impression of EQ so far.
Basically I love it but the tradesman/vendor thing really isn't
feasible unless you have a spare computer, two accounts, a 24/7
connection, and strong wrists.
