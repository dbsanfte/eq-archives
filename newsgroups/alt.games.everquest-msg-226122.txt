I am under no illusion it is an easy task, but some ISP's are definately
better than others in keeping on top of it. Normally it comes down to a
question of priorities and whether the newsgroup server is given any at all.
The newsgroup server in question only carries about 17K worth of groups - no
binaries at all so by comparison to a binaries carrying newsgroup server it
should be a walk in the park eating cake and cola.
