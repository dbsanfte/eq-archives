Good LORD, you've gotten lucky, then. In my experience, every single
attempt to have a "discussion" with a KSer has resulted in a barrage
of obscenities and d00dspeak from the offending party, and my attempts
are generally rational and mature.

As a former guide, I can tell you that KS complaints were -EXTREMELY-
common. No, "simply moving" isn't an acceptable solution. It is a
solution, yes, but not an acceptable one. I should not be forced to
move because someone else is being an inconsiderate jackass. Also,
that doesn't solve the problem when it's someone who's just determined
to be an ass and decides to follow you.

Jackasses in the game create a need for this "brick wall", as you put
it. The brick wall can easily be removed by yelling for help when
you're in trouble. I will, however, admit that WoW's method of combat
locking is better: Others can help at any time, but won't get any xp
from the kill. They can also freely buff and heal you.
