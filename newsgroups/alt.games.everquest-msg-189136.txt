It's mainly for the quests that originate in Thurgadin.  Unless your guild 
is already on giant faction and you'll be skipping Velious entirely or 
jumping straight to WToV, the Thurgadin armor is by far the easiest of the 
Velious quest armors, so it's a natural progression for a guild.

Otherwise it's pretty much about the shawl and ring quests.
