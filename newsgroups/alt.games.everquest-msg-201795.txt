Actually, my old group minus me as I've moved out of the area still gets
together every other weekend to play...  LOL  I won't mention that we are all
almost 40... or maybe I will...hehe

Being the only female in the group and apparently the only one with an intense
desire to escape NW Indiana, I have moved away and replaced my physical need
(LOL) for AD&D with EQ.  None of my old group plays EQ.  Matter of fact, their
wives are quite put out by the fact that they still want to get together every
other Saturday afternoon for a couple hours to roll dice and slay bad guys.  My
opinion is, hey at least you women know where they are and what they are doing.
 Get over your stupid selves and go shopping.  LOL

As for me, my daughter was born 3 months premature in May of 1994.  You better
believe she was at Gen Con that same year...  LOL  She got out of the hospital
in late July and there I was with her in August in her little carryall pouch
around my neck.  That was the year we met George Takai and Majel Barrett
Roddenberry among others.  I also have pictures of her with Ed Greenwood
dressed as Elminster... hehe

The following year when I took her, she got to have pictures with Klingons, RA
Salvatore, and many others.  All my old group were just astonished...  LOL  "My
wife won't even let our kids LOOK at my dice, let alone bring them to the
Con..."  I just smiled and said they should have married better.  hehe...
