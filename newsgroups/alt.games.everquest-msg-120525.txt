 This being Ring of Fire or another one further in? It would be nice if
they retuned the original Ring of Fire to not suck.

 Interesting that they were tradeable before. I guess they didn't pay
much attention to that since I doubt anyone on FV is ready for VT.

 Yay. It's all about unused zones!

 Wow. They nerfed an item that they nerfed a year+ ago (by taking it out
of the drop tables). I guess all those people doing the vendor recharge
made the game unbalancing! What they could have done was just set the
vendor sell price real high.
