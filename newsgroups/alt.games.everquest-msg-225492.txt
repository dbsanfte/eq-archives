Tier 1 planes experience sucks, tier 2 on the other hand is great. With
some friend's help I got my rogue through PoJ trials and leeched an
Aerin Dar kill flag at 55 and Halls of Honor experience got me through
59 in a day, 1% per kill. Earlier levels were even faster.  However, PoD
experience is ok in the courtyard but you need a good group to do it
well. At 52, try Dulak harbour solo or duo'd. At 52 my ogre shaman (+15%
exp needed per level) was making 1% per kill. Dulak, according to the
recent zone modifier list posted, has an 85 ZEM even though it's an
outdoor zone. My shaman has been there since 45 or so and it's only
slowing down now at 54. I think if I tried one of the boat camps it
would pick back up again.  If your shaman friend is at the same level as
you, they'll probably be wanting pure blood soon so you'll be heading
there anyway, may as well try while it's all blue.

It's too bad, when they first made the experience changes, ME and UP
were very nice experience. Also, if you're in the mood for soloing, try
the corner by the lake, up on the wall is a safe place to pull to. An
old guildmate mage did very well up there solo he told me, though that
was a while ago.

Wierd, I wonder if they chanced the ZEM when they redid it, it used to
be one of the higher ones.
