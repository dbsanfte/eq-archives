You might want to try chain-petting though. Costs more gems, but healing
takes way more mana then it's worth.

But for us mages there's hope:

At lvl 49 I sat back and let my burned-out damshielded earth pet take it
down. I nuked once or twice so it wouldn't have to regenerate too much
health back after a kill.

At lvl 55 I sit down and get a coffee while my water pet kills it off and
gets back to full health before the next one.
