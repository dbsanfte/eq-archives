I made a social for it, but I've never seen a reward for begging.  For what
it's worth, however, here's how ya do it:

/attack off
/do 1 (or whatever number beg is on abilities)
/attack on

I just click that social whenever beg is available, while fighting.  No
noticable break in attack, and I have got beg pretty high doing it.  Like I
said though, never got anything for it.  But with that setup it's easy
enough to raise, so give it a shot eh.
Begging from pets is good too, but this method (like binding sense heading
to your move key ^_^ ) is a good way to work it without so much clicking
tedium.
