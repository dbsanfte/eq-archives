>maybe they should try a US server then.

Problem is for most of its life Runnyeye was marked as a US server,
even though it was always meant to be EU.

Due to the time differences it would of been a good place for Americans
who only play during the day to create chars. Since EU peak times is
roughly early afternoon in the US.

Now its marked EU, on EU patch times and US players aren't allowed to
create any new chars there. So it's understandable why they are not
happy.

If you look at the SOE Runnyeye forums people are concerned how many
people are going to be left on there. When the game launched Runnyeye
was by far the busiest server (even at off peak times it was medium to
heavy load) but so many people have been moved elsewhere it's now low
population even at peak times. And since it has higher ping times then
the other EU server (which also has more people) its arguably the
lesser of the two EU servers so won't attract as many new people.
