  Well, I don't know where he got it, but when I asked in EQ Lounge, an
EQII forum, for more details, someone cited this:

The original intent was to allow for body customization, but when put
into practice it didn't work as we had hoped. 

The issue is that some of our racial distinctions are quite subtle, and
allowing too much customization effectively makes some of those
distinctions meaningless. If you make a tall, burly Human and a short,
thin Barbarian, you end up with too much overlap and a loss of the
original concept of both races. The same could easily be said for
Dwarves and Halflings, let alone the various Elves. 

Nor do we want pregnant Gnomes or anorexic Ogres. While we want people
to have fun, we don't want one person's silliness to infringe on someone
else's desire for serious gameplay. 

There's also the art issue to consider, in that distorting the basic
skeleton of each race causes textures to stretch and potentially look
unsightly. Our artists put an awful lot of work into making sure armor
and clothing look terrific on each race, and allowing that to be twisted
in a random fashion would negate that effort, or else require a lot of
additional resources to be used in order to address visual issues. 

So we've taken body customization out, at least for now. If we can find
a happy medium to allow its use while still keeping the proportions of
the various races intact, maybe it will come into play down the road,
but we're not giving any guarantees.
