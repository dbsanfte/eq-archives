Guide program. Allow some to go and buy plat, when the player comes to
hand it to them in game, ban that seller account. Rinse and repeat.
You will be doing that for a long time, but you can always reverse the
transaction, so it costs nothing.

Set up a plat buying scheme, buy the plat for cash, ban that char
publically. Won't have to do it often.

Ebayed character can be handled the same way.
