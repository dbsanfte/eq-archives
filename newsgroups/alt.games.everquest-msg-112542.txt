Well, you did not hear the whole story. Yes they removed alignment
grouping restrictions but its pretty needed. The problem is that when
you get uber, you might want to be in X guild. X guild, though, Is a
Neutral and good guild but you are an evil char so the goods there
can't heal you or receive your shaman buffs, etc. Get it? You could
then be a great player and not be in the best guild on your server and
instead only have the choice of some Evil and Neutral crap guild that
sucks.

As far as languages, they removed the LEARNING CAP but they are still
the same to start. That means once this change goes through on MAY
8TH, that you can group with a dark elf and he can babble and you can
rapidly learn dark elf. It removes the old one point per day or hour
or whatever cap that FV had.

No, so you hit on to the exact reason why they are making the language
change A WINNER IS YOU! Previously you would have had the HORRIBLE
need to learn common, basically, VERY slowly. Often these languages
you earn several points in NEVER even appear at your trainer on the FV
server. 

For some odd reason my Barb shaman got one point in gnome, dwarf,
halfling and dark elf. The weird thing was the next time I was at the
Barbarian shaman trainer I suddenly had an option to train dark elf
and halfling at level 10 but I had no option to train the other
languages I got a point in LONG before dark elf and halfling. I also
never got an option of those other languages showing up at a trainer
later.

When my barbarian shaman started, it had Barbarian and common (human)
at master. As I said I then got one in dwarf and gnome. Later I moved
to the commons and got one in halfling and dark elf. At about that
time I went back to halas to train. I then, for the first time, had
two more languages that I could train = dark elf and halfling. I never
got gnome or dwarf as an option. I don't know why, no one I have asked
about it knows why. 

I would also assume that everyone would try to learn the human
language ESPECIALLY if evils. I mean, as hard as languages are its
easiest of dark elves, trolls and ogres all just learn common rather
than dark elves having to learn troll, ogre and iksar (and common for
any neutrals) Don't worry though, as of MAY 8 with the patch you can
merrily group with whomever and learn their language in minutes just
like on the regular servers.
