It depends on what boats you mean.  There is frequently a translocator on
Cazic on the dock with the shuttles that are supposed to take you to the
Timorous Deep because the shuttles never hook up with the Maiden's Voyage
for the trip around Timorous.  They stay until the next server "pop", after
which I (or someone else) has always had to petition to get them back.  If
you mean for the trip to the Ocean of Tears, I'm not sure - I've only seen
OoT translocators in Butcher and FPort once.
