Head down the path towards the gates.  With the gates in view, there are a
pair of large trees on the left, with a smaller tree between them and a
little closer to you.  The thorn drakeling spawns in between those three
trees.

I also hear he spawns out around the hill to the right of the path at the
same place, but I've never pinned down the exact location.

Now, if you happen to know anything about the large yellowjacket, please let
me know.  I'm about to lose my will to live (or at least continue playing
EQ) here...
