mmm im afraid u right, level14  is practically a hell level for soloing BST,
as the Western part of
the tickets, the underground tunnels and Hollowshade Moors r too dangerous
for u.

especially the Moors, when as u said light blue mobs could beat you and your
nearly useless pet, not speaking you will usually end the fight running for
guards with some crowd on your back.

at level 14 ur pet is too weak to hurt a bit, dont taunt at all (whatever it
says) and will aggro most of mobs, including green ones!


The only place you should hunt (soloing) is Paludal Cavern. Southern part. U
have to find a spot where camping blue tunnelers or blue sensei. The big
mushrooms wont help each other, and the tunnelers have a very short aggro
range. I mean tunnels, not big cavern full of army of fiend !

Just beware to invoke your pet at the camp spot and tell him to guard the
place. then pull to him hehehe.
Never travel underground with your pet. Dont ever think about it. They will
always get lost, meaning lethal trains. Just invoke at camp.And dispel it
when leaving camp.

when u get ur new pet spells (and some more!) life began easier, really :)

But dont hope to reach safely the Shadow heaven , and then Gate to Freeport
or anywhere else without some sort of invis. And as u surely know, TP or TL
players are rare around. What makes the 14th definitely a boring level lol.

not sure to understand your question. There is some decent magical HtH
weapons often dropped by bandits and poacher, compared to other 10th hunting
places in Norrath.And im sure you already got tons of them ! You could even
find some more powerful sold to merchants by higher players and at a low
price hehehe.Piercing speaking , the scorpialis is funny but dont enough
damage. About the blunt, only know the ones a body can get by the the Saurek
claws Quests,  too weak if i remember well and need to kill hundreds of
Shredder, Deathmaw and Firefall (con red to You, do not insist) for each
type.

For the scorpialis and the 3 types of club, go allakhazam about quest and
stats (which i dont remember, sorry!)

Mortepatte, 15th VS BST
