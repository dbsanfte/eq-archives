Hmm - so what's the most you can parallelize (? probably not a word)
graphics rendering?  If you devote a processor to each pixel, can you
do realtime raytracing these days?  

Be that as it may, the current EQ client already off-loads a large
amount of the parallel stuff to the card (T&L and per vertex operations)
I still doubt that most of what runs on the processor has many ways
to improve from parallelization (yet another word that I'm sure doesn't
actually exist, I've seen too many GW speeches apparently).

Also, what's the status of Linux clustering? I've kind of lost touch
with the graphics programming scene and the machines that support it.
