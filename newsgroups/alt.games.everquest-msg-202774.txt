The wonderful thing about this combined with the new bonus is that
we can now go to zones which don't require a slower and tank, where
my 65 ranger buddy can tank anything unslowed just fine, and we still
get ok xp and the chance at some decent loot (Nadox today, UP is on
our list to revisit).  Yeah, xp wasn't quite pre-patch PoV level, and
definitely lower than post patch (for a full group) but it was still
noticeable and we just went there with 3 of us, then added the others
as they logged on.  No "required" classes - just go have fun, get
loot and and xp.  (picked up a coral ring and a neat bow for my bazaar
mule :)

Bleah, you should have seen the discussion at the Tower, many of
us really don't want it to cast those spells, but it looks like SOE
is committed to it being a wizard and using wizzie spells.

The one I saw for an elemental flagged ranger was VERY nice.
I only have my PoV/PoS flag, so mine was pretty minor - +1 int,
1 ac, +1 to all saves, +8hp +10 mana (IIRC)  But there is still
the opportunity to flag and make it better.

As for AA's I got one, but I didn't ask the NPC for any more than
that - I'll go ask him again.

They brought down PoK this afternoon and brought in the NPC you 
talk to for the reward (next to the FP book)
