Well, it's not as if the stats are *that* awe-inspiring. If you just
want the blue chain look, see if you can get someone to make non
enchanted chain mail, or possibly imbued (I don't know if it's
possible to do that, or if it has to be enchanted in order to be
imbued)

(At least it's not as bad as most imbued jewelry... Tunare jewelry is
a perfect waste of emeralds)
