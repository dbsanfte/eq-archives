   Interesting question.   I've heard that the beastlords
are a cross between shaman and monk, rather than shaman and
warrior.  I guess it may be reasonable to think that their
h2h skills are the same as a monk's.  According to
monkly-business, between the levels of 5-9 a bare-handed
monk's fist equals a weapon with a damage  of 5 and a delay
of 36, ratio 7.2.  A quick look at allakazams tells me that
the rusty ulak is 6 damage 44 delay, ratio 7.333  or awful
by their rating, but a small, very small, improvement on
ratio 7.2.  It also has +5 to mana and +5 hps, and is a
magic weapon (yeah, I know,  a rusty *magic* weapon, you
say?  But the comments about the weapon on allakazams seems
to point in the direction that this might really be so).
   So, it it a better weapon than bare h2h?  Well yes,
maybe, marginally.  The magic part will be nice when it
comes time to slay wisps and ghouls (iirc, bare monk's fist
don't become magic until level 30).  The extra mana and
hitpoints are small, but in some fights ever little bit
helps.  The ratio, again, is better, but not by a large
margin.  However... if our beastlord friend is looking to
raise his weapons skill, bare-handed might be the way to
go.  Lower delay, more swings, and thus more chances for a
skill up.  Unless I were maxed out on a particular weapon
skill, I would probably take the faster, lower ratio one
until I did max out, all other things being equal.  I
suppose, in this case, it might boil down to what he's
hunting.    
    Of course, the supposition that this is based on is a
bit iffy.  Just because it might make sense to me, and maybe
you, that a beastlord's fist would be equal to monks, it
certainly doesn't mean that Verant would feel that way too.

she didn't really answer the question that well.
