The nature of epic encounters are changing, too.  They're becoming less
epic.

A cleric friend of mine asked for help with her fight in SolRo temple, for
example.  I did it a year ago, with a warrior, the cleric, my enchanter, a
shaman, and a mage; tough but fun fight.  This time the cleric showed up, a
shaman friend, and my wizard.  Shaman and cleric buffed us up, cleric
triggered mob, shaman slowed it, I hit him with Agnarr's Thunder twice and
finished him with an Ice Spear.  Cleric didn't get hit, shaman got hit
twice, he didn't get through my epic rune.  Elapsed fight time, about 40
seconds.

I won't bore you with what we did to the goblin king that was her next step.
