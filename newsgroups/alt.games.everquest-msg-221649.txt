A couple more queries.

- There's a quest to bring 4 rat whiskers to Exterminator Vin.
  How do I do this?  I've given him 10 whiskers so far, but gotten
  a reward only twice.  The first time I "gave" him 4 whiskers at once
  (ie, drag them to his picture), and nothing happened.  Then I gave
  him just one, and I got the 1g1s1c reward.  I immediately gave him
  one more, and got nothing.  I haven't detected a pattern here.
  I'd probably have made more money selling the whiskers instead of
  doing the quest.

- Someone gave me a chest to fill up with ore.  How can I get ore?
  Can it be mined?  I supposed I could buy some, but I have no money.  I
  saw somewhere that I can "make" ore (out of old metal objects, weird),
  but I've seen no in-game hint about this.  I finally just destroyed
  the chest because I was out of inventory slots.

- I've also found some items that no one wants to buy (silver coin and
  a mushroom).  Can I assume that if a general merchant won't buy
  something that no merchant anywhere would want it either?
  Should I just destroy these as being worthless until I figure out
  tradeskills.

- I had gotten "stuck" in the water, and was unable to get back onto
  shore, even using a ladder.  It felt like a bug, since I could never
  get my eye level above the surface of the water, sort of like a "stuck
  in the scenery" bug that many other games occasionally get.  I
  eventually took a breath and camped, when I reentered the game I could
  leave.  Is there a way to get unstuck in similar situations?
