It is possible to run a successful planar raid with FS and
banded/bronze.  Just ask the peeps on Test.  So,  Don't underestemate
the factor of skill and experience.  The challenge wouldn't be fighting
without gear, but competing for spawns.  Think a level 1 mage being able
to walk un-molested through unrest or Naj or warrens.
