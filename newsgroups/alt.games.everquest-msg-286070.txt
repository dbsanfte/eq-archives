Theres too much griefing in EVE. (under the guise of roleplaying)
My hopes are pinned on Hellgate:london right now. I need another MMO but I'm 
tired of MMO's that require guilds/clans to achieve anything. I had a gutful 
of guilds when I was playing WOW (also when I played EQ) and the associated 
politics that seem inseparable from them.
