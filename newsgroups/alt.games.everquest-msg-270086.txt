The griefer problem in EQ is described largely as players messing up the 
game for newbies, who don't know whats going on and who will get turned 
off by this sort of thing and decide to leave before getting used to the 
game.

The solution is for players to form guilds, and rely on those guilds to 
boot out griefers.

Whats wrong with this logic?

Well, it doesn't take a level 70 PC with raid sized forces to screw up 
the game for newbies, it would be trivial to do with a level 20 toon, 
and not really hard to do with an experienced level 1 toon.

They also go on at length about PvP attacks... only the vast majority of 
EQ1 players were on non PvP servers, where there's very little chance of 
doing this sort of thing.

Then they talk about COH's solution to the problem by saying they have 
no PvP so there isn't any griefing.  Well, there may not be any 
griefing, but it isn't because there's no PvP, after all, there is no 
PvP in most of EQ1, and there's plenty of griefing there.

SWG's solution is my favorite.  "We can't be everywhere, deal with it 
yourself".  Thats not a solution, thats a hands off policy!  And if the 
principle problem, as far as the bottom line is concerned, is turning 
off newbies, then it does nothing at all; yes, experienced players can 
deal with this sort of thing, but they aren't the ones the article 
suggests are being driven away.

The only actual attempts at solving the problem, rather than glossing 
over them or addressing issues that aren't the central problem they just 
discussed, were by the consol games; friends lists (but that doesn't 
help with newbies, who don't have friends yet) and banning based solely 
on bad feedback from other players.  This last one seems to me an easy 
route to griefing in and of itself; hand in bad feedback about some poor 
innocent till his account gets banned, what fun!  Of course depending on 
how the feedback thing is implemented, that might not be possible 
without a cadre of coordinated feedbackers, and the one advantage "good" 
has over "evil" is that evil tends to fight and bicker amongst itself, 
rather than playing nicely together.

Fun read, but ultimately a lame article because it doesn't address those 
issues, and a sad note on the state of MMOG's if thats really the best 
these people could come up with to say.
