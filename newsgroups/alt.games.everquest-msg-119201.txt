That's only true if your kill rate is double that of a non-pet class.
And that's most likely not the case.   As long as you out-damage
the pet, however, you're only giving up 1% of the XP and your
kill rate is almost certainly going to be (at least) 1% higher than
any non-pet class, at least as the lower levels.
