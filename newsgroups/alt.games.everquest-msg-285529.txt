Sure, I'll get it from the same place you present your documentation

Indeed, the last few patches have run over, between DoD and PoR my 
memory suggests they were better.

I'll agree to differ on the exact fine point of those phrases, I use 
them virtually interchangeably.

No, not really, just passing time until the servers come up.  While 
writing here, a few new posts of interest turn up on the Sony forums, so 
I head back and read those, and in-between that I'm doing some washing up.

Wasn't it "Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative" although 
he's often misquoted.

Indeed, so you could do that in notepad.  And then delete it.  You make 
the conscious choice to post here it.  Even a blog that none of us read 
would work.  That's where I do most of my pointless ranting.

There isn't one.  The best you can do is read the Sony boards to keep 
up-to-date, but you disagreed saying they were crap.

No, but the boards would make the process smoother for you in some 
instances where they get updated before the network downtime page.

That's fine, don't post.  But if you read them you might be better informed.

Ah I see, so you're cutting your own nose off to spite your face? Gotcha.

Ah good, you know where they are at least.

It matters little, it's the journey that is important.
