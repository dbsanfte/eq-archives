Pretty much what I said...
piracy = public broadcast... with p2p its the same thing...
duplication and transmission are one and the same.

They  don't. They have specific rights to restrict how others use
their IP. Those rights begin and end with 'copying' and 'performance'
type activities. Its not a blanket... I can stop you from profitting
right.

Because duplication *is* a protected right.  (even a slightly enhanced
or modified version - 'derivative work')

Because duplication *is* a protected right.  (even a slightly enhanced
or modified version - 'derivative work')

And both are specifically protected against. Transferring items in a
game isn't mentioned, and isn't obviously encompassed by what *is*
mentioned.

I can write a book review of the HP book and get paid more than the
author did for writing the book. I can write a book about how to use
Microsoft Office and charge more for it than Microsoft does for the
actual software. If I buy harry potter books and compost them I can
sell my dirt for as much as I want.

There is nothing to stop me. All of these businesses rely on other
people churning out books and software (IP) for me to review,
document, or compost... as long as I dont *copy* it I'm free to do
whatever the heck I want with it, and make as much money as I can from
it.

(And by *copy* I mean infringe on the specific rights protected by the
copyright acts... duplication, performance, broadcast, etc.)
