The skies still blue, now that they fixed the DX9 bug... =)

Anyhoo, the reason I was arguing for a shared newsgroup was based on
examples of other newsgroups that I do frequent, with related topics
thatr are divergent, that manage the different topics reasonably well
with appropraite tagging.  

There groups get either a comparable amount of traffic, or far more,
and topical stuff does manage to be filtered appropriately  if the
rules are followed.  I've seen how this group will crack down on
top-posters and non-clippers and other assorted evils, so I see no
need for a different group.
