My bus is a agp 4x but the new pci things are really looking nice as
alternatives.

For the OS: I first ran win ME, but that actually started to run slower with
more memory. I now have win2000 and it seems to go a lot better. Especially
with gamelauncher, which ups the priority of EQ to the max, devoting most if
not all system resources to EQ.

I even heard win98 can't handle more then 512 mb, so that alone would almost
be a reason to upgrade (for us "powergamers" at least :-)

I'm not planing on any upgrades besides the more mem for at least this year,
and probably not until my pc becomes the "standard pc" for households. After
that; who knows, probably 3GHz, 2GB ram and GeForce 5 or such :)
