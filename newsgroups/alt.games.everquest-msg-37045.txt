> what would you recommend to buy for a Druid with say 14 to 16K pp

Sorry for the tone but it's been a bad week.

Did you buy the pp on Ebay?

If someone plays enough to earn that kind of loot
I'd think they would have a few ideas or at least a
less general question. What gear do you have now ?
With a little more info you'll probably get a better
answer.
