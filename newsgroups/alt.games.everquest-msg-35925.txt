Oh? Rallos Zek was "meant" to be PvP-on for -/+ 4 levels. With 1 item
and all coin as loot when you died. It has stayed that way.

You realize this makes it worse for most people, right? Blatantly
exploitable.

Human nature is a bitch.

The same as they always have. Walk up to someone, kill them, loot them.

Coin-only loot is *ridiculous* as a "reward". If anything, its an open
invitation to those who are already used to item-loot to just cause the
person exp loss instead by training them.

The only way to get anything near a decent cash reward for a successful
kill is to just be lucky, or camp a bank. I do remember a couple of
times on RZ when friends have got up to 4kpp in cash off a corpse, but
99.999999999% you'll get like 9 copper. Kill a decaying skeleton and
you'll get more.

/ignore beggar_01

I'm so used to recieved annoying tells from random people it doesn't
bother me in the slightest. If a beggar asks for plat when I'm on my
necro I just tell them I buy bone chips for 5pp/stack. And thats it.
Maybe 3-5% of beggars actually come back with a stack.

Yeah, they would never have to do that now or anything. lol.

Why don't you log for 5 mins, or just go play an alt (unless its on SZ).
