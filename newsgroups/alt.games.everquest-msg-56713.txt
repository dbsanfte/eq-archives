Yes definitely some work needs to be done on this.  I tried it on test
server and got stuck as the only player in NK as a level 6 lioness, put
in a part of the zone, where I had no clue where I was (so far in my
rogue's 42 levels, and my druid's 31, I have yet to find a need to
truelye go much north of the gypsie camp.  And have never needed a map
for the area between the gypsies and the bridge, so /loc didn't really
help much.  At level 6 sense heading was useless too.  I attacked the
first thing i saw and tried again to wind up as a pixie trickster.  Died
to an even con.  Didn't try running it to the guards, but should have
since I know they don't attack the pixies when you are a PC getting
killed.
All in All I wasn't overly impressed, however, with some minor tweaks it
could be fun.  Maybe a limited choice of zone.  Or maybe i just had bad
luck, but who wants to be in a zone by yourself heheh.
