Nope.  At level 16, you can put only 1 point into research.  If you do,
you can't put any more points in until 19.  The cap on research skill is
(level-15)*5.  Here's a table:

        Level   Research Cap
           16      5
           17     10
           18     15
           19     20
           20     25
           21     30
           22     35
           ...

You can't train in a skill if your current skill level is above the cap.
Your first training point sets your skill level to your level.  Hence,
if you put a point in at 16, you get a skill of 16, and can't put any
more points in until your cap is above 16, which happend when you hit
level 19.  You can then put 4 more points in.
