Tried both (root v instill) with pretty much the same success rate last
night. Since both spells seem to be susceptible to wearing off immediately
after the first nuke strikes the mob I found that root was best since it
casts slightly faster and costs less mana. Basically, I just re-root and
then nuke, rinse and repeat. A bit mana costly but effective. Any other
suggestions on tactics for a 37 cleric while soloing?
