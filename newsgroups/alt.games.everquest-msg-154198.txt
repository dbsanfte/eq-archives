I have heard of guild Bazaar mules displaying items which are 
primarily intended to be handed out to guild members. This way, 
guild members can browse the mule and ask for any items they need. 

The items are priced ridiculously high since they're not really
intended to be sold. But, if someone actually pays the inflated 
price, then that benefits said guild just as well.
