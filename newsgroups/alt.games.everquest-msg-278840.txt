Hi group,

reading the "bug shout..." thread it reminded me about what must be the 
oldest bug (or feature) in the game.

When I started playing, in the summer of 2000, the marketplace was in the EC 
tunnel.

The game very often cut off whitespaces and the last digit of numbers, but 
only when the swear filter is on.


Fictional Example:

You auction, WTS Sacrificial Dagger, only 400 pp.

This would show up as "40p", with the last number, the space and one of the 
"p"'s missing, for those with the swear filter turned on.

You tell a friend, 'give me a tell with 'two hundred plat'
A friend tells you, '20p'

It's become painfully obvious since I started 4-boxing how what you type is 
not always what it looks like on the other side, even if you master the 
language you speak and are not intoxicated.

I repeat, this only happens when you have the bad words filter turned on.


Another example is capitalising what you write, I can't see any meaning with 
it.
You tell your guild, 'gnome.'
Other people see you tell the guild, 'Gnome'

It's just one of those non-critical bugs that you learn to live with, get 
used to and forget to consider them bugs after a while.

See you in there!
