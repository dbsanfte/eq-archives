I think...it would be best if you backed up a step.  As a starting point I
suggest you search this newsgroup for answers to your questions, and links
to good websites.  Further, I suggest you read the .doc files in your EQ
directory and play the tutorial if you haven't already.

Don't mean to be curt (it happens anyway) but these questions have been
answered before a few times ;-)
