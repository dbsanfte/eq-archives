Worth about 1k. The proc (at 45th) is an AoE spell and therefore limits it's
use, nice damage delay, to tell the truth I'd keep this item and then move
it at 45.

> Dwarven Ringmail Tunic

Won't sell for a lot, may as well keep

> Spider Fur Collar

About 1k

> Spider Fur Cloak

About 1k again but actually well worth keeping, not many cloaks this good
fro this amount of money.

> Black Ice Sleeves

about 2k on these.

If you can sell the collar and sleeves and go for Rygorr or Ivy (Rygorr is
better IMO) then do so but be patient when selling, just because you haven't
sold in 2hrs doesn't mean you won't. Don't get desperate and drop the prices
unless you see everyone else selling these cheaper (just one person doing
so, doesn't mean a thing, take them off the market until that person sells
or leaves) Another tip, ignore anyone that says I'll trade you this <PoS
Item> it's worth 4k etc If it was they would sell it and pay you your 1k.
Only trade for something you need. You should be able to pick up a full suit
of rygorr for under 2k now.

Remember everything you have at the moment you can use, trading for
something you can't use just because it *maybe* worth more is not always a
smart move.
