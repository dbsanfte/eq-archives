Man. The more I hear about Discord, the more I doubt I would ever 
consider playing there. A cowardly noob-farming mid-teen level jerk could 
make life positively miserable for every level six player around? Sure, 
you can get back to level six again before too long after dieing, but it 
still takes time.

I think if I ever *did* try it out, it would only be until I got killed 
that first time after reaching level ten or so and had to start over.
