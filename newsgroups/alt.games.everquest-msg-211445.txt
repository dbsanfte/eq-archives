    The scripting on the quest is pretty neat (a few guildmates have run
it), and it has a nice storyline. The result, however, is broken.
Specifically, the illusion turns you into a human male on Live servers. I
hear it's working properly on Test. It's kind of funny to get an enchanter
with Project Illusion to turn a bunch of female characters into men,
especially because it is a true sex change - gender-specific AA titles will
be changed from the female to male version. However, there are some bits of
guktan that are still attached to the illusion. A feigning monk, for
example, will hear the "froglok death" noise rather than the "human death"
noise.
