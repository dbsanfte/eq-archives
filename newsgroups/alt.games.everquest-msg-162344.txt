Iksar was my choice.

Pro:
1. Regeneration. Native regen stacks with Chloroplast, Spiritual Power and
AA Regen.
2. Bonus AC
3. Highest starting Wisdom
4. High starting swimming skill (minor)

Con:
1. Big ol' xp penalty they share with Trolls

Could be Cons but aren't:
1. Their inability to wear plate isn't a penalty as Beastlord's can't wear
plat anyway.
2. With Luclin & PoP their bad faction really dosen't matter.

Other things worth mentioning. Ogres, Trolls and Barbarians get Slam. Iksar
and Vah Shir do not. The Vah Shir's sneak ability isn't much use for moving
and staying hidden (never was for me). But it was handy a few times with
merchants and quests.

However all the races are close enough that it's really a matter of style.
There's no bad race choice. Which one do you prefer based on looks?
