Hi,

A while ago I heard someone in the game talking about becoming a Grand
Master with regards to their skills.

What exactly did they mean by this?  Does it refer to them getting one
of their skill levels up to 200 (or perhaps above 200)?

Or does it refer to one of the various tradeskills such as baking or
brewing or something?

Does it work something like specialization?  Allowing one skill to
increase beyond the others?

Is fishing considered to be a tradskill?

Just wondering.

Many Thanks,

 - Mike Dorr
