I also suspect that's the main reason behind the "you have to
buy a game box to create a new account" rule.  Otherwise, grief
players would just start one account after another every time
the last one got banned for misbehavior.  This way, at least,
it'll cost them $20 a cycle (and used to cost them about $40 a
pop until the "classic" edition was released).
