I didn't see a patch message on the fort but they've changed the pathing.  You
now have to pull the elites / chief / oracle right out the door, they won't
agro through the walls.  Matter of fact if they run into the walls they won't
come outside at all.  They just run around for a while then go back to their
places.  I'm not describing this very well I know.
Even sitting down in agro range won't bring them outside....
Do you think this was intentional?
