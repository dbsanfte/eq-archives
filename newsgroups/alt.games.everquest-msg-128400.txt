I just figured out that XP found out how to use my special keys all by
itself! It doesnt know what kind of keyboard I have, but somehow the special
buttons work, and I've never installed any special software. With 98 I would
mash the buttons when I was bored, but now they actually do something... So,
if hes using XP, it might take some digging in the OS to figure out how to
disable it. I havent figured it out yet. So, I'm no help.
