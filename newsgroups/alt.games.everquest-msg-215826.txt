Hm, well just got done wiht an adventure. Without any mana enhancement 
spells, it takes me about 5 minutes to get 25% of my mana pool to do a 
rez. With beastcrack i can get the same 25% in 3 minutes. That is with a 
FT1 solstice earring in place....with beast crack, kei, protection just 
before we went in, and a bard singing in my ear i can practically 
chaincast my divine light  heal spell, or pop a CH on the MT/puller, 2 
celestials on the casters in back that get tapped on once or twice in a 
pull, a divine light on the MA tank and a remedy on the shammy sitting 
there canni-ing herself until the cows come home. For between pull 
shammy canni-ing, i will use my Donals BP CH when she hits 10% health, a 
liching necro ... or on a rezed person after we get popped out. My 
favorite group was a SK as MT/puller, warrior MA, necro, bard, shammy 
and me. 3 pets, constant killing. IIRC we did the 59 mobs in just over 1 
hour crawling through one of the mistmore undead-fests. One time I would 
like to have Necros, SKs and clerics...2 of each on an undead crawl just 
to see what happens
