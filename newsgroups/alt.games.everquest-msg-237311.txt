Howdy, last night I did my first Ldon adventure, when we started out
we had a full group, but when we finished, there were only 3 or 4 of
us left (a couple people LDed and didn't wouldn't couldn't come back
whatever.
Anyways we finished the adventure, and I got 12 Ldon points... Is that
normal average or whatever or is that because of the amount of people
that died?
