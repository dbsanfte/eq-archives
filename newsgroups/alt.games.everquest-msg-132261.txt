I disagree.  You're one hell of an arrogant greenhorn if you have nothing
else to do but whine about Usenet groups you don't like.  Don't foget to
look at the rest of the alt.flame.* hierarchy.  I'm sure you'll find
something else.  But once you start down you path, you'll also have to 
petition to shut down alt.fan.adolf-hitler, or else you're nothing but a 
pro-Black anti-Semite.  Etc, etc, etc.

I could give a flip about the group.  But people like you always have a 
problem with the big picture.  Namely, you can't see it.  See above for a 
refresher.

Usenet is the "public Internet".  Or are you claiming Cox employees author 
and publish it all?  I don't work for Cox.  Do you?

This smells like some passive aggressive P.C. way of asking my age.  If
that's what you'd like to know, just hike up your gonads and ask so.  In
any case.  I've been posting to Usenet for over 10 years.  And have been
paying to do so for over 10 years.
