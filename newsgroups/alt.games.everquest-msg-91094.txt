This was the link, http://members.telocity.com/~ericruess306/equ I tested it
and it couldn't be reached. Since i just rebuilt my PC about 3 weeks ago
this link has died sometime in the last few weeks. =(

If you were after it for the eqclient.ini editor you might want to try
EQColors. Its very nice - http://home.attbi.com/~eqcolors/
