Swiftwind and Earthcaller, IIRC.  Nifty blades, they had the Warriors
screaming in anger, since they outdamaged them, and had a better proc.
Interesting quest to get them, too.  I suggest hiting
http://members.fortunecity.com/eqa/ to see the quest.  There are some rare
forrages that are required, and if you're in any of those zones, it's a good
idea to try to pick them up then (save you time in the long run).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
