There's no way except to "click item, click sell, repeat",
unfortunately.

Heck, I'd be happy if I could just click on an item I
wanted to sell and then hit "s" (for "sell").  That way
I wouldn't have to move my mouse back and forth from
my container to the "Sell" button.  But nooooo....

However, if you just want to *destroy* all the items in a
container, hand the container to an NPC known to do the
"I don't want this you can have it back" behavior.  When
you get the pack back, it'll be empty.  This is useful
sometimes when you're "mining" a vendor (buying out his
junk to see what else he has deeper in his inventory)
and don't want to be bothered manually destroying each
piece of junk or reselling it to another vendor.
