Similar to breaking it down and translating the network address to allow the
packets to pass through a firewall?  Like Windows-ICS?  WinRoute?  They
definitely qualify as manipulating the information, I mean, the IP you're
transmitting to EQ isn't even your real IP if you're using one of these
programs.  =P

Your logic is slightly flawed.  They can ban you for any reason they feel
like.  They'll never ban you for "manipulating the information" on your
private network.
