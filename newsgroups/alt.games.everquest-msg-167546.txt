Hi,

Fairly new to recent EQ developments and have three questions

1) I have a level 12 Necro. What is the highest I can raise his INT or other
attributes to?  His INT is currently 211

2) I have just installed Planes of Power and I see that it has installed to
a different directory to my original EQ one. In have enabled the expansion
and the raid window comes up but when I tried clicking on one of the portals
to get to the Plane of Knowledge - nothing happens?

3) I have just come back to EQ. I seem to remember that when I played
originally you used to get spell messages to tell you how much damage your
spells especially DoT's were doing. X is hit for 20 non-melee damage or
something. Now you cast normal spells and DoT's and I see nothing in the
message box.

Hope someone can help, thanks.
