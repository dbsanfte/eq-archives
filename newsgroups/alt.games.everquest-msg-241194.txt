From the shadows, the mysterious Aruvqan <mtraber251@earthlink.net>

What would be the fun in that?

The very first quote is the ace in the hole that negates your later
points - this one:


>> *    Newsgroups are like self-governing communities; there are no
>> "Newsgroup Cops." Instead, posters regulate themselves.

The newsgroup has, over five and a half years or so of existance,
established what is acceptable and what isn't. This isn't a science
newsgroup (at least, one that hasn't been overrun with kooks) or
anything like that; it has more community elements and as such fights
will tend to be more acceptable than might otherwise have been.

However, regardless of posters disliking one another and giving them
hell when the chance arrives, in the interest of *readability* and
other technical issues unique to usenet, the standard of
bottomposting, nearly universal across usenet (despite some claims to
the contrary *cough*), is the one in use here.

I don't believe you, and therefore demand to look down the front of
your shirt to be sure. Fair's fair.

It's not usually much of a problem. Maybe the FAQ should be posted
biweekly, but general usenet etiquette is for people to lurk for a
while to understand how things work in a group before they begin to
post.
