The Misty guards aren't that big a problem, since they don't
walk around on patrols.  Sure, if you're fighting near the
Rivervale entrance or the wall gate, they might get involved,
but that's the price you pay for the safety of having them
nearby.

There are other zones, like Field of Bone, where one or more
guards wander around and sometimes steal kills, but they still
mostly stick to the newbie areas.  In Shadeweavers, Ferin goes
fairly far out, and often passes very near a quite nice camp.
Quite a nuisance!
