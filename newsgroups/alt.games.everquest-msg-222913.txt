Nobody ever asserted that we should be calibrating our moral compass 
with psychotics. Its almost self-evident that any moral guidelines that 
you derive from what insane sociopaths think is going to be pretty 
questionable.

Terrible example. That is a far cry from thinking that everybody should 
be killed. Your just making some sort of right to suicide argument, 
which is far far less controversial than advocating mass slaughter on 
all sides.
