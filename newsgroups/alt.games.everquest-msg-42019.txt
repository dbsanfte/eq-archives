What I would want in EQ2...

More weatehr effects... different strength in rainfall and snow, blizzards,
occasional or rare hail (thatcan hurt you! =P), a sun that goes east-west,
AND makes shadows of everything.. players, objects, rocks, trees.. and just
have the moonlight barely luminate objects

the zones. No more of those big skyless tunnels. (everfrost, BBM...)
The zone lines, there is alot of tunnel to tunnel zoning, I would rather see
that only in dungeons or underground passes and ever now and then mountain
passes but have them thick kinda like DL-FV. More of the wide zones, but
have a warning if you get close to zone maybe just so you dotn by accident,
or maybe just remove zones completely.. hah yeah right.

as addicting as current EQ but basically more eye candy... oh and new races
and classes and a new storyline. also my recent suggestion to verant...
something like a monthly hard quest with a good reward, kinda like an epic
of the month. It wouldnt be easy to get spoilers and it would give high
level people somethin to do
