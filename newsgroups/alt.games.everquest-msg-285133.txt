As I understand it there's a set or two before the level 45 ones, and 
then there's the level 71+ ones.  I don't know if there are any between 
the 45 and 71, and I don't have any details on the ones before the 45 set.

For the 45 set, talk to one of the two NPC's in the Mesa, just to the 
left of where you zone in from the Moors.  Assuming it works like 
everything else there's probably a progressive quest which tells you 
about that quest giver already, because there's quests which send you to 
just about every quest giver so you know where they are.
