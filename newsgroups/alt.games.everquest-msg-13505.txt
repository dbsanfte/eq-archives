Thanks to those who replied!

I ended up purchasing a Crystal Fiber whip, which is DMG 8 and DLY 26.
 Seems to hit for a lot more damage. But according to the posts here,
I need to work on my 2HS.  The reason I haven't up until now is that I
currently have a shield that I use - Chitin shield with 15 AC and SV
poison +10.  Am I better off getting rid of the shield altogether?  I
really enjoy being able to bash and interrupt those evil Orc Priests'
spells! Once again thanks for the advice! :)
