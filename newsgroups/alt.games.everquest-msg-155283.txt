AE spells are the defining spell for a wiz. Snare 4 and quad kite them.
Druids can do it too, but not as well. Of course wizzy needs jboots or sow,
or aa run. One of the fastest ways there is to get xp.

Wizards are also useful in dungeons since they can snare. Also, I dont think
a pally res is a substitute for evac. For starters... how are you going to
get your corpses if you died deep in a dungeon. Coffins arnt free and you
need a necro, which your group probably hasnt got. The paly is probably back
at his bind anyway and gonna have to get to the zone. Fun fun fun. Ill take
a 0% xp loss over a 10% xp loss anyday, especially when it saves me several
hours messing about.

See above... quad kiting.

Not unless they need an evacer or are desperate for a snarer. Wizards dont
have the sustained dps of a melee class, and even with loads of mana coming
in, they still have problems with agro.

Yes, wizard is one of the least desirable classes for most groups. Thats the
price you pay for being the best soloer post 50 i suppose.

Im not sure if the best answer is to make wizards more group friends, or
make it easier for them to solo pre-50. A very easy way to accomplish the
latter would be to give them some self-sow spell at say level 8 or 12. I
supose for making them more group friendly, give them more efficient nukes,
and maybe a self only hate reduction spell, or maybe a dd that worked like
celestial heal for agro.
