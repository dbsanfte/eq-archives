Machine "lag" is not the same thing as lag.  Read up and figure out which
you are suffering.

Hint, the green bar with the four numbers shows you actual lag.  Running
through Warslik's Woods with full clipping plane will show you machine lag.

You are suffering from both.  Upgrading CPU/RAM (and probably video card if
you're running a 266) will be cheaper than a faster modem, and give you the
best performance boost as well.  Upgrading to a faster modem would be
expensive, with a continuing extra expense, and you'd still be limited by
the speed of your computer.
