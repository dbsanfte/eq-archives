You do realize that you're trying to argue about this with one of
the groups resident uberguilders, don't you?  Martin's go better
stats on the gear of his most neglected alt/bots than many of us
will ever see on our mains.  Certainly I'll put more faith in his
opinion than in your smart-alecky response.  You might also look
at James' assessment of the loot elsewhere in the thread.  Stats
are nowhere near as important other effects, and those loots
include effects that are otherwise unavailable.
