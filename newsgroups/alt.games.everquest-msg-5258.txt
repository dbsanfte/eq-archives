Probably wrong.

You mentioned right away that the orc was "Hauling ass towards Kelethin"

With a few exceptions (shaman mobs that SoW themselves) mobs never move above
a slow walk on patrol.  If this one was hauling ass, it's very likely that
this person had already engaged it and was leading it to a safe distance to
fight it.   You can generally see monsters at a farther distance than you can
see players.

As for the second situation, who knows.
