It's an item proc, only item Lucy's lists is Sarnak Lightning Caller.

Looked it up on Alla and according to one of the comments posted
there it drops off Underboss Myli'ki in Chardok who spawns near
Grand Herbalist Makha and who will be holding the hammer if he
drops it.


It's slow, but the proc should be fairly high agro (122dd+stun) and
the ratio (15/28) isn't bad so it would probably make a decent off
hand weapon for a not-quite-uber Warrior.
