This all sounds like some of the arguments that used to take place in 
flight-sims about "artificial" aids.

I've never been against them, particularly, because in real life you get 
much more sensory input to help you know locations, etc. than you can ever 
hope to get looking at a monitor screen.  Stuff like map pointers, etc. 
simply helps make up for that deficiency a bit IMO.  <shrug>
