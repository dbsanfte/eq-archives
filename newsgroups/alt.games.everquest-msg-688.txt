Yes, that's how it is NOW.
But aren't they changing that?  Am I understanding it right to say that they
are going back to the way it was in the beta stages where a LV10 and a LV15
grouping would cause the LV10 to get 40% while the LV 15 (making up 60% of
the group's total levels) gets 60%?  In this case and even the way it is
now, isn't it that anybody in the group ALWAYS gets some experience, just
that if you're too low compared to the highest that amount is so slow you
don't notice it?
Am I correct?  If not then someone please show me where I'm misunderstanding
things.

LV16 Ogre Warrior
LV7 Halfling Druid
