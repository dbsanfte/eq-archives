Not that I'm on Xegony, but do you mean money, as in plat?  Or money, as in
U.S. currency?

If you're desperate for plat on Xegony for a character of yours, and don't
want to compete with all the other auctioneer voices in the GFay, I can
understand that.  /Auctioning here, and making arrangements to meet for the
sale can be an efficient way to sell your goods all at once.

However, if you're asking for U.S. currency, I suggest you get your asbestos
undies on......
