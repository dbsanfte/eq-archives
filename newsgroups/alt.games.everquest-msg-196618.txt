Well the maps you can get from maps.eq-toolbox.com 

Those download into your in game mapping tool - but I believe they have
viewable maps on the site.

Failing that eqatlas should have some description by now I assume.

Hmm, 35+ is how its rated. At 40 as a ranger I was hunting the beach edges
of Gunthak zone solo, but fairly slowly. At 35 I imagine it might be hard.
Groups is another matter, at 40 I was in reasonable groups on the zoneline
of Dulak, as well as beach trash parties. 30-40 is probably pushing it for
dashing round the zones but not impossible.

The beach is good with static, non social mobs with small aggro distances.
So long as you have an escape method its pretty simple to hunt.
