According to Allakhazam Lacquered Star Ruby's are a trivial
of 128.  If you want to do these with as few failures as possible
I'd get your skill to 140 and pick up the Geerlok (Gem Cutter
I think).
The biggest help you can give yourself is the Geerlok, I have
a Jewelry skill of 226 and I do high level combines (250 &
250 + ) probably 9/10 times.

My suggestion would be to grab some Malachite and some
Gold and do the bracers until you get to around 140.  Then
you shouldn't fail too often with lacquered stuff with a Geerlok.
If you don't want to use a Geerlok I'd probably go to 147+

(These #'s are based off my personal experience, I don't have
a direct reference for them)
