I could see it w/o a cleric, pally rez is good enough but unless
you're seriously uber you have to plan on people dying down there. 

Either you plan on feign pulling so your puller will eat the
occasional death or you rush the mobs at their spawn point so you
don't have to deal with gaters in which case you deal with 3 at a time
and root parking clerics just doesn't work all that well.

Agreed, I just don't think those tunnels fit into that category,
unless you just hunt around the fringe.
