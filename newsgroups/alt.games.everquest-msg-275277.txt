It's not that simple, I'm afraid.

E.g., there's a quest where one step is to climb N'Mar's Ascent and the only
way to get there is to pass 10 to 15 solo agros (blue, white and a few
yellow ones at lvl 26), one or two at a time. Unfortunately, some of them
wander up and down the stairs and they respawn fairly quickly, so you don't
always get to decide when the next fight begins.

If you have some sort of sneak capability, I suppose you could do it easily,
but a soloing 26 guardian runs out of power way before he reaches the top,
and then there's no escape because all the ones you killed on your way up,
will attack you if you turn around and run for safety. In other words, to
some it will be soloable, to others not, even if their level is the same.

But of course it would be possible to design and label some quests
definitely soloable. Boring, I think, but possible. Next, people will demand
that the number of steps and the rewards are announced upfront, too, so they
don't waste their time. Why not just give players a nice item and some coin
when they level?

IMO, those who continually complain that their path to glory is obstructed
by the designers -- be it because they're required to group, because the
phat loot won't drop often enough, or for any other reason -- fail to
understand that without such difficulties and frustrations the game would
become pointless.

It's the achievement that gives you an adrenalin kick, not the virtual sword
or ring that you get as a reward.
