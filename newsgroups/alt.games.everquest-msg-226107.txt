Buncha fucking illiterates.  I swear.

Quote:
MaloX seems to have about ten times the aggro for shamans as it does for
magicians.  That could be pure perception, though, as shaman malo is
generally followed with one of the highest aggro spells in the game.  :)


Now, unless you have the absolute worst shaman in the world, or your
warriors never bitch about aggro, you *have* seen:

Shaman tells the raid, 'Malo in on %t'
Someone tells the raid, 'Shaman down'

Now, tell me I don't have to fucking spell it out in single syllable words
for you morons that I'm aware the aggro comes from slow, but that it "seems"
to have about ten times the aggro for shamans as it does for magicians" and
that "could be pure perception, though, as shaman malo is generally followed
with one of the highest aggro spells in the game.  :)"

Again, you are a bunch of illiterates who haven't the faintest grasp on the
concept of context.  Why do you bother to pollute the world with your inane
and quite literally thoughtless banter?
