Of course not, it sucks.  I absolutely agree that Tradeskills should be
rethought in general.  I don't, in general, work on a tradeskill for hours
on end.  Every once in a while, I take a break from xping/raiding, and so
some tradeskill work.  In the case of the known, upcoming smithing changes
on May 8th, I did spend a lot of time raising smithing on one of my
characters to beat the deadline, but that is the exception for me.
