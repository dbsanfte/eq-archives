Not really noticably, no. But if you really need to know look at
www.xenosisguild.com (our web site) and we have loot pie charts for
each mob showing the proportion of drops. With a bit of legwork you
can work out the drop ratio for each zone (you'll need to total
the individual mobs) from over a year of EP farming. Even though
we rollick around in time now we still do EP during offdays, etc.

We had chain rotting long before plate to be honest.

Heh. Ranger archery isnt unbalanced, but tradable EP bows sure as
hell are. A melee bump would be good; its kinda sad to be a pretty
sprite on most raids. In fact, I would say 8/10 raids my guild tell
me to play my cleric even if we have 11 other clerics online, rather
than my ranger. 

Really, Ranger melee needs to be a viable source of DPS, or we need
some kind of 'core function' gimmick. Our spells are pretty much
useless at the high end, in that we lose more melee damage from
casting time than we gain and of course our utility is all duped
by a druid far better. Only need 1 ranger to SOP a raid.

I wouldnt mind seeing, say, a fast cast 2k heal AA that ate our
entire mana bar or something, or a short duration disc reusable
frequently that let us do serious damage. Just something so that
once in a while folks said 'Ooo, glad we had those rangers
along to the raid today, that was a close one.'

With track super-nerfed in GOD, other classes getting weaponshield
discs and superior-to-harmony pull techniques and our only damage
AA (trueshot) now failing to outdamage equivilantly geared rogues
non disc I'm not entirely certain where we're meant to be. Don't
even get me started about ShowEQ users and druids/bards with 
maxed bug-track ;)

Thinking about it, the DPS space is pretty packed already. It'd
be nice to find a different niche for us, if possible. Oh well ;)

Regardless, my ranger is still my main, and in XP groups the
combination of functionality is hard to beat - suddenly all that
irrelevant-to-raids-utility looks really neat, and the 'crappy
tank, ok DPS, cool spell tricks, moderate puller' combination
is nice because we have limited group slots and 'not the best'
is 'good enough'.

On a god or time raid, with a whole raid dependant on you... 'not
the best' just means 'not happening' 99% of the time. I suppose
thats not a problem confined to rangering, though.
