Whoa! Nelly!

What is that for?  Jason said nothing to deserve that filth-laden diatribe.

  When you first equip ANY weapon, your attack will likely go down because
your skill with the weapon stinks (unless you are 1st level with no skill
anywhere).  Put the 1hb weapon in your secondary slot and you will gain
skill with it (slowly).  Of, course, your off-hand will do much less damage
for a while.

So, at 1hb, you suck compared to 2hb and bare-fisted.
