Hi all.  After waiting for a long time, my guild is finally ready to
try Fear to get a few of our shaman their tears for their epics.  I'm
doing the research on spawns, force needed, etc.. and have read
'guides' to fear on about every website I know of including eqshaman,
shaman's crucible, rpgexpert, and many more.  Unfortunately, it seems
that many of these resources list conflicting information.  I've even
gotten conflicting stories on where the Iksar Broodling spawns, some
listing that it pops right where the golems die and others say it
spawns in a totally different zone.  

I would really love to hear from someone who has done the Golems
lately to give me a heads up on Fear strategy in general, especially
the Golems.  Anyone insight anyone can offer would be greatly
appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
