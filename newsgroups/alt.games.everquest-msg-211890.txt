James, to put it frankly, those shoulders suck for warrior.  A 5AC -10STR is
not a warrior's gear make.  The STA is awesome and the HP bonus is sweet.
But dang.  For the same price you could have gotten some imbued granite
shoulders that are 20AC, +10 to all of your resists.  The hands are good.  I
used them until I got my soulscream belt from veksar.  The idol is good too.
Owned one myself until I upgraded my Bow.  Overall you have a very capabaly
equiped warrior for your level.  But I do not like those shoulder for a
tank.

here is a GREAT link for warrior info:
