All casters have 5 areas of specialization.  Only 1 can ever be over 50.
You will probably want Specialize: Alteration to go over 50.  There are 2
ways of handling it.  1) Put 1 pt into Alteration only and when you hit 50
with it, put 1 point into each of the others, or 2) put your 1 point into
each specialization and cast a lot of Alteration spells until it tops 50.
