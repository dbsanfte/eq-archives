Awww you mean I can't give Ulthork tunics to newbies anymore and watch
them keel over? Darn. =)

Umm if its a compass I hope it makes SH work 100% of the time.

So then what is the downside of having a familiar?
Its just a clarity buff then?

Holy shit. That is a big change. Well time for the bad faction people to
kill hordes of greens to raise faction again. I'm glad though, kind of
seemed lame to bypass faction for quests like that.

Wow. That is going to be a shock to those troll and iksar. It's a good
change though. They already get a racial bonus, doubling the AA regen
was a bit much.

Wow. Nice changes for Rogues.

That should be a great change.

Hmmm. Is that good or bad?

No wonder.

Umm ok. Can someone explain the difference between a 'problem'
a 'bug' and an 'exploit?' Seems to me that pathing bugs can be 'used'
as an exploit but they are all still bugs.

Woot. Adjustment as in added.

1000? I wonder how many of those will be useful? 20 maybe?
I don't envy anone running a trade skill site.

Ahh nice changes for Pet casters.

Hehe would be cool if Necro horses were skeletal.

Hmmm. Did they add more animals besides the wolf and bear? Or..?

Nice I hope it 'works as intended.'

Woot!
