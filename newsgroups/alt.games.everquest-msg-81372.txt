No, but that character as a seperate entity has not earned them. I always
find it funny when I see some character kitted better than my main shout
Ding 6! Right, WTG there that was that hard was it?
I'm not anti twinking, I do it as much I possibly can I just know that,
because of the twinking, that character is having a much easier time of it
as opposed to my main.

Was talking to someone yesterday who was wearing 2 haste items because the
AC and stats were better than any non haste items he had. I made a comment
about him having items that I could only dream of and he got quite defensive
about it, saying how he had put in his time for his equipment, led over 30
Naggy raids etc. Now I have no reason not to believe him and was even polite
when he stated how he hated traders like myself as I hadn't "earned" my
equipment, I did try to explain that as a casual player who, being in the
UK, cannot attend raids (all I have been on have not got off the ground
until gone 12am GMT) this is the only way I'd ever get the nice equipment I
have and my friend, also a casual player (although wouldn't be if he had the
choice) would also not be so well equipped if it weren't for my
trading....but to this guy, I seem to be worse than any twink <shrug> so be
it.
