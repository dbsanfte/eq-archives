Plane of Halfling Dr00ds.  They are all indifferent, have some
absofuckinglutely AMAZING quests to give, but you can't get them to give
you the quests because they can't be bothered to talk to you. And if you
try to kill them, they snare your whole raid and quad kite you around
the zone until you die.
