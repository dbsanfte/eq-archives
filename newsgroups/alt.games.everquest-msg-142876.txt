That'd be unique, wouldn't it?  Give Druids something a little bit
special at the high end that's still easily mitigated by encounter

Sorry, I suspect that idea has far to much merit to gain any
substantial following among the current design team.  I mean, how
would adding something like that into the game help you to get
into FoH?
