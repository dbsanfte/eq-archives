Some of the new players have been rude, unwilling to share, wanting to
scam, looking for exploits, having this I can do what I want attitude,
and generally having foul mouths.

If you decline to play a "Casino" you get a rude tell back, or
expletives, or a snide comment. If you have a camp, and they want it
they start taking the spawns without as much as a "pardon me". If you
decline to buff, lets say because you are LOM, you get a /rude back.
Even the beggers are out thick, and scammers have been a regular
occurance.

I even got one "genius" who bypassed my group in HHK, started pulling
the gobbies we were camping, then started about us KSing him. We then
agreed that we wouldn't KS him, let him solo the goblins. He died
fast. He was then mad, sending tells for us not saving him. He even
tried it again, but this time he tried to train us, but didn't make
it. We cleaned up the mess after he died again.

My wizard was out in Rathe, playing around. I get tells for a port,
which I declined to give, then I got another one about why can't I
bind, and port him then gate back? Then I declined again, and I got a
rude comment back. Ignore doesn't help there either. I won't get
another tell from this person again, unles they need to beg for
something else. It isn't the asking, it is the rude comment. I have
been on the asking end, and when they decline the response I give is
simply, "thank you", not "F you".

Is it me getting old, or have things declined a lot since I started
the game? I have had /ignore problems, with these morons pulling
trains that I don't hear, because they are on ignore. So the tired
old, "Just put them on Ignore" doesn't work very well.

I still give away trash to newbies, like tizmak items, or hand off
wepons that I can't use, or even go to Freeport and buff the newbies
there. There seems to be a more who just seem to want to live
parasitically off the fat of the land.

I feel much better ranting it away!
