Last night, I decided to strip my Druid to pay for my Monk habit. 

Today at work, I was wondering how much of my crap had sold. So, I decided 
to go check.

I sshed into a linux box I had at home, mounted the eq directory on the box 
I play on (via Samba, for those who care), then did this:

[root@eviscerated emptied]# tail -f /mnt/bzrlog_71_MyDruidName.txt

Woot! I made half a k at work. God bless the bazaar.

So I decided to search around using unix tools in my logs. I decided to 
check for all instances of PLZ, plz, PlZ, or whatever in my logs for this 
character (who is an alt).

The count of lines containing that is 1475.

My God.

On a side note I think I will start to write some tiools for Linux 
platforms to play with logs... nothing major, but I'd love to make a system 
that lets you set up a share like this and watch your sales through a web 
browser... Would anyone here be interested if I wrote something like that?
