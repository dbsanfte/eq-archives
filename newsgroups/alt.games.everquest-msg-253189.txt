This is how I feel about it as well. However I've noticed some people
ask almost immediately.

As I see it, any interaction that has to do with my character is
responded to by the "character" not the player and therefore I feel no
need to bring real life gender or anything else into it. That includes
pretty much any action in game.

If something directly in real life is being referred to then I respond
as the player, but I don't encourage this; beyond knowing I'm Canadian
and I have a job that currently restricts me to earlier hours of the
evening only friends from before I started playing EQ know anything
about me and I don't invite further delving.

If the character is female and they are treating with that character
for anything in game, I simply don't agree with this.
