Well, this is not me so you must be referring to Vladesch. Look, all I did
was ask a simple question as a new eq player. I wont give details but so you
know.

Nope, wasn't me. I don't know how to shout in zone or send tells. I've also
never been told I wasn't wanted in any group.

I have no-one on my friends list and only have two character's. My other one
is still in the tutorial.

Ok, I went and checked I've been playing EQ a total of 15 hours and 23

It was after all only a question people.
