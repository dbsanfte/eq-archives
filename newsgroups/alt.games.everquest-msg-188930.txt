Well, monday night I lost 4 items when EQ crashed during an item transfer.
I'm pretty sure the guy I had helping me didnt steal them, but that's beside
the point. I've yet to hear back from my "GM contact" email and I just spent
an entire 5 hour session (my ISP dumps me every 300 minutes) sitting on a
/petition. The petition was eventually answered by a guide who upped it to a
gm 60 seconds later. An hour after that i dropped, came back on for a few
hours, nothing... logged again.

Q: Now that my petition was upped to a GM do i need to keep /petition-ing
when i log in? Or will that sit in some separate queue until one gets a
chance to look at the logs?

I wouldn't bother with all this crap except those items took about nine
hours of killing giants to buy :(
