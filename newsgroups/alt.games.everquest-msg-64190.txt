Its Verant who seem to have the trouble. If you think a job will take 18
hours assuming all goes well, you say 24, because all probably will *not* go
well, at least we did when I was working in a support department. Sometimes
things will go really bad, and you might need more than 24, sometimes less,
but it should average out.

Also, whats with the profanity? Cant we at least be civilized even if we
dont agree? Ditto to other people who I wont bother to name here, you know
who you are.
