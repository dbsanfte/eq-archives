Snippet from interview with Lenny seven years later:

"What happened to Annie? I'm not sure, really. Ya know, I was going to
stay with her forever, but I just couldn't get over the whole
"crack-whore" thing she had going. She's just sooooo possesive! I mean,
it's not like I was dating supermodels. Now *that* would have cost a LOT
of money! Crack-whores are a cheap date!"
