There are three gypsies that do this, one in NK, one in Oasis, one in SRo (a
DE for the dark races).  No conversation needed, just hand in stone get
book.  The book for GLS is a container, so you need an open inventory slot
for each one you plan to get back, can't come with 8 backpacks full of
stones unless you want to leave poor.  Ideal is 4 backpacks full and 4 open
slots, now you can hand in stones 4 at a time, then sell the four books, and
repeat till you run out of stones (10 slot bags means even more GLS per
trip!) Since you get so many LS though, you can also do fine with 2 open
slots and 6 bags of mixed goods, hand in 2 GLS and 2 LS each time instead.

If one in ten mobs drops a GLS, then you only need to kill 80 mobs in an
hour to fill a backpack.  Thats not too hard to do on kerran island where 4
wisps spawn about as fast as you can kill them... sure is tedious though, if
you can kill em that quickly they aren't giving any experience thats for
sure.  Jaggedpine wisps have a better drop rate and may actually be exp
mobs.  I still have to question 8 GLS per hour but it doesn't seem
impossible.
