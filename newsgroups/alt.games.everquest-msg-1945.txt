I give directions whenever I'm in Gfay.  The most frequent questions and
answers:

Where's the bank?
Up the POD lift (the one with the fire) Across, over bridge, left, up.

Where's the ranger guild?
Champions of Faydwer, from the bank, up, right, down.

Where's the druid guild?
Soldiers of Tunare, from the bank, up, right, down, down.

Where's the warrior guild?
Emerald Warriors, from the POD lift, first platform to the right.

Where's the bard guild?
Off the platform between the newbie and POD lift.

I really should create a macro set just for Kelethin. :)

Where's Crushbone?
