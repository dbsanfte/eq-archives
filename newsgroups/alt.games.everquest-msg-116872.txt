I played Diablo a long time ago but I hated the multiplayer game.  I can't
say for sure having not played Diablo 2 but EverQuest is miles infront in
terms of game play, content and fun.

I started playing EQ about 10 months ago and have not bought another
computer game since.

If you don't like structure EQ is probably for you.  Basically you do what
you want - If you wanted to sit in a tavern all day getting drunk you can,
if you wanted to kill orcs just for fun you can, if you want to learn a
trade like smithing, tailoring or brewing you can, if you want to level your
character up to it's 50s and spend all your nights in the Temple of Veeshan
fighting dragons - you can do that too.

EQ is a vast and wonderful world, you can immerse yourself in it completely
but be warned, it can have a negative effect on your RL social life ;)

After 10 months of solid fanatical playing I am only now getting a little
tired of the world, and that maybe because I'm not sure whether I like the
post level 55 game or I'm becoming restless as SWG approaches ;) .

> if someone can give me basic info on gameplay and how the online play
works

There is so much to tell I wouldn't know where to start.  There was a
magazine cover disk a while back giving away a 15 day free trial (the
original world only - no expansions) maybe you could try find that.  I think
you can by the original release online and it's quite in-expensive that
might be a good place to start.

I hope that helps in some way...  ...Hope to see you in Norrath,

Bah!
