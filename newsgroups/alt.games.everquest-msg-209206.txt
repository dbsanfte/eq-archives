I'm pretty certain that MR is used for all root resist/break checks.
This does give Enchanters and Shaman an edge when using root (tho
Enchanters rarely seem to make much use of root, they have other
tools for CC).

The only damage I have ever noticed breaking root is DD damage
(including spells like Wizard stuns and Shaman DoTs that have a
DD component).  Others have claimed that melee damage breaks
root, but that does not square with my experience.  There was a
brief time when archery damage was breaking root, but SOE called
that a bug (well, I think the word they used was "unintended")
and removed it.  DoT damage does not break root, except for the
initial DD component of some DoTs.


to the OP:  Most (all?) scarab model mobs are noticeably slower than
PCs, so they can be kited without root/sow/snare.  There are scarab
mobs in FoB that are still dark-blue at least to 16 (I think maybe
all the way to 20).  Unfortunately there are also a bunch of KOS mobs
there that are not slow, so it might not work as a solo spot for a
Wizard.
