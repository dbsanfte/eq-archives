Still, they can tank, should they have to.  Of course, this is
impossible in the latter parts of the game, but a good shaman who's
kept his AC high enough can tank just as well as a ranger or pally or
SK.

Yet until mid 50s, Monks tank just as well as warriors, if not better.
The only thing they lack is a taunt button.  And considering the
damage they pump out, it's not terribly hard for them to taunt using
pure damage.
