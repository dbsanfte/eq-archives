They want it because of the fear it'll be a requirement of the second
gen epics purported to be in development. Most (including me) would be
ecstatic if we could swap out epics for something like:

Pawn Shop Ticket of the Epic
MAGIC LORE NODROP
Wgt: 100.00

Then if/when the epics are upgraded, just hand it in along with 10kpp
and get your epic back ):o)
