Hi

I have a 31 warrior , and just started an SK.  My warrior has been playing a
lot with my friend a 31 Pally.

At the outset we presumed I would tank and take damage and he would do extra
damage , so I took all the hits , did some damage and did the pulling, he
healed me afterwards.

Now however, since about 25 or 26 roughly, we have found we get on better if he
taunts and takes damage and I hit the thing - he seems to take less damage than
I do (even though my HP and AC are higher) and, better still, if the mob is on
him I seem to hit much more often for much more damage per hit.

Is this my imagination or is it understood ?
Are SKs pretty much equivalent to pallys in this aspect?
Can someone tell me what MA means (I noticed it in another post)

TIA

S.
