Well, aside from no information whatsoever coming out of thier
in-house beta team, and the fact that apparently Take Two has dropped
the game from their lineup...

It's going to be a cesspool.  It's heavily PK, with an emphasis on
"player justice".  We all see how well that worked out in UO.  That
being said, Shadowbane will be a very important game if it does happen
to come out, as it'll provide a release valve for all the  griefers
and other scum that would otherwise be attracted to the decent games
coming out.

In other words, the more people that want to play Shadowbane over EQ,
Fallen Age, and Dark Age of Camelot, the better off we'll all be.
