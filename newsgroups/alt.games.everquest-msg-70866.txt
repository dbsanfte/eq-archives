It doesn't need to stay directly in the center of your screen, you can move
it to the side or corner. Click in the little box in the upper left corner
of the transparent window to drag it, click again to drop it.

You can also increase/decrease the opaqueness of the window. I forget the
option name, but I think you can find it in the supplement.
