Its not the ONLY way to beat it... but pet tanking gets you killed,
and killed lots. It can work, if the stars align and all bad things
happen at the right times, but i've been in way too many groups where
the group got brutalized using this tactic. I would say that it would
take much longer without charm pet, and the guy at the end would be
much more difficult for a 9.6k to tank. Doable? Ya.

On the boss? Its usually tanked, but Furious and Weapon Shield still
work fine and with a charmed pet either is all it needs to smoke the
boss.

Heh.. this they usually just send pet in on due to its low hp. It
drops like a rock
