I would start them again and go agnostic (if you can as gnome).  Some 
races will see through all illusions if your deity is particularly 
opposed to theirs, but they're quite happy to deal with agnostics.

Deity doesn't prevent you making any cultural items, only prevents you 
wearing them, so agnostic enchanters are the ideal choice.
