While I do think you're jumping a bit, I'll take it as your pov.

However, you really do have to consider that they are 2 different
games.  Games like EQ and FFXI are about those things you like.  Long
hauls, tough death penalties, long camps, tons of grinding, and TONS of
repitition.  This is a style some people like.  It creates a more
social atmosphere, because the gameplay can become monotonous.

A game like WoW is a different breed.  It's not meant to appeal to
people who enjoy 96 hour camps.  It's not about sitting in one spot
killing the same mobs for 4 or 5 hours while chatting it up with your
group.  It's faster paced.  That doesn't make it "Blow goats."  That
makes it a different game.  It's more twitch based.  Combat is more
involved.  Leveling goes much more quickly (not 3 weeks....3 weeks is
powergamer leveling..I am a semi-hardcore player and it's taken me from
8 months my first time, to 4 months my most recent time).  And of
course, that's just the leveling.  Then there's the raiding (which I
don't personally enjoy or have the time for).

The lack of an exp penalty on death just means that you are more free
to explore and experiment without worrying that you'll have to grind
for 6 hours to make up for it.  The only character I could do that in
EQ with was my monk.

It's a good game.  It's a different game.  It's like comparing a
"stealthy" first-person game to a "shoot em up" first-person game.
They're both fun if you're into them, but you can't compare them too
far, as they are trying to accomplish completely different goals.
