If you look at the skill ups as a pure RNG, then I think you're right, and
it
can be frustrating if you take that view.

It's just barely possible that Verant has something else in mind, though,
that
it's intentionally not a "white noise" random number generator... that it is
intentionally streaky.   I know that when I'm learning some skill, I tend
to plateau for a while until I overcome some hurdle (e.g. a mental block).
After the block, there can be a rapid progression of learning for a while
till the next plateau.

My wife just skilled up her wizard from 40 at blacksmithing to 115 using
toolboxes till 51, and skewers till 115, and we did notice a number of
streaks
in that progression.

On tip, when tailoring, buff up your DEX too... the claim is that you will
be
successful more often (though it doesn't affect skill ups).
