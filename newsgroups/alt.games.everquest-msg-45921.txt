Yep, as a druid now just don't since its not worth it. 
Don't kill anythings that screw up gfay factions and don't ever go to
the POG zone and help people there killing at all, that includes
buffing them at all. 

If you are ready to kill them, go to lake of ill omen and kill goblins
instead or something.
