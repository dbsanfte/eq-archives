Heh.  One time in a pick-up group in The Grey, the Enchanter
got cranky and said he was leaving the group because he was
sick of us tanks breaking mez.

I was one of the two tanks in the group, and we had a hasty
/tell conference trying to figure out what the problem was,
because we were both mez/assist savvy and as far as we knew
hadn't done anything wrong, and hadn't seen each other doing
anything amiss either.

So we just apologized to the Enchanter for anything we
might possibly have been doing wrong, and asked him please to 
stay, we'd try real hard to be careful of the mezzed mobs.

So for the next couple of hours, we had the comical situation
of two tanks tiptoeing up to each new mob, looking over at
the Enchanter, and asking without a trace of sarcasm, "um,
sir, is this one okay to smash on now, please?"  We were
overly cautious in order to avoid the Wrath of Enchanter again.
