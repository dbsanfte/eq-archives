My sad story...

I was late finishing work and arrived at the wizard portal in sro to find
all my guildies had already ported up to hate. I said hi in Guildchat and
got a tell from the raid leader saying that once they had cleared a path, if
I was willing to hang around they would come and fetch me.

Being a tailor I decided to use the time to smack a few spiders and get some
silk and also kill the supposed PH for the AC aswell as any undead that
happened to be around.

My heart started beating faster when I targeted the first Hill Giant I saw
and it turned out to be the AC, /who revealed I was the only player in the
zone with any chance of taking the guy out. I dashed over, let fly with a
few nukes and watched as his health bar started to slide, a few more nukes
later and he turns and begins to leave the scene. Only to head straight for
that Gypsy? camp in the middle of the desert and get wiped by an NPC.

So first I miss my first raid to hate, then to cap off a crapy day, lose the
AC to an NPC. Grrrrrr
