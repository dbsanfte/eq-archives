For some reason, I personally have a terrible time navigating on the roads
in the Karanas, even during the day...even if I have a map and compass.  At
night, when playing a human, even with the gamma cranked to max, I almost
can't see it at all.  When I'm playing a low level character, I constantly
get agged by lions and bears along the roadways as well.

I find it much safer to go southeast as soon as you zone into WKarana until
you hit the river.  Then follow the river eastward until you get to the
wooden bridge in NKarana.  You'll have two or three sets of raiders to watch
out for along the way.  They don't wander, so just keep your eyes peeled,
and you can easily avoid them.

[minor shift in topic]

If I were an NPC in the Karanas, I'd open an inn right between the Wizard
spires and the stone bridge in NKarana.  Just hire a big Barbarian Warrior
or two to guard my inn, and everything would be fine.  Then I'd build a dock
and have a river boat carrying cargo and passengers from the Stone Bridge to
Villiage McManus.  I'd be rich, I tell you.......

It just seems a natural spot for a town to develop....something larger than
a mere villiage, but smaller than a city.  It's at an
economic/transportation crossroads.  Build a small stone wall to hedge it in
and keep the occasional lion or swarmling out, and you'd be set......
