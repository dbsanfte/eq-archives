Well I'm sick of people dishing EQ2, a multiplayer game, simply
because they have to play with other people. It as multiplayer game of
course you are going to have to group with other people!! Of course
there are going to be times when you are forced to play with other
people. What did you expect? A multiplayer game when you never have to
interact with other people?

>You do realize "MMORPG" does not and should not mean "Have to group

I've actually soloed about 90% of my time in EQ2. I only group when I
need to or want to. Sure sitting around waiting to the right people can
be dull but that's no different then any other multiplayer game. Yet
people seem to be really criticising EQ2 for it.

Then you are looking at the wrong game. EQ2 IS a multiplayer game.
Which is a good thing in my mind. If it not what you want then fair
enough but that's no reason to totally blast the game.
