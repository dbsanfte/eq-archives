Yeah, I saw the underwater entrance. I bound a lvl 1 Halfling Rogue
there, before he went on a scouting mission before a big raid took
place. I had no intention to visit the Hole dungeon, though; as a Druid,
I profoundly distrust dungeons, but I love skydiving, that was basically
the reason for my question. I didn't even know you would zone before
hitting the bottom :) I will probably try the dive from the ledge to the
swimming pool below, that looks about doable.
