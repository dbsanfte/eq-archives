A semi Related question, since the new patcher, zone alarm seems to
"aggravate" it.  The patcher will stop in it's "connection" mode, not
responding, zone alarm also stops responding, sometimes quitting the
patcher (ctrl alt del) will make zone alarm work again, sometimes i have
to quit it too, but even doing so, it seems to hose out my connection,
and i have to reboot.  Any suggestions other than disabling/quitting
zone alarm to play eq?
