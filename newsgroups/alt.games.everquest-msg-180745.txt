Have you seen the starting stats...100 DEX/AGIL and decent STR/STA
before you allocate bonus points. For me the question is not whether
or not I will make a Froglok...It's simply a matter of which class to
play. :-) I've never played a Knight class past 24. Perhaps it's time
I took the high road and went Pally. There is so much RP potential in
a Froggy Paladin of Marr I get excited thinking about it :-P.
