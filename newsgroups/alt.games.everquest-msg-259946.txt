Yep. I've already seen it. From the looks of it, once you do an area's 
quests, that is ALL the quests for that race/area you will EVER get, 
even if you start another class. This sucks because every Dwarf/Gnome 
you start gets the same ones. Now, if they are trying to get you to try 
other races, I guess I can kind of understand, but I've ALWAYS been 
partial to Dwarves and they tend to suit my personality and my in-game 
jovial, yet sometimes surly, attitude.


Still, it beats the heck out of the other games out there which only 
give you a very few quests EVER to perform and the majority of your time 
is just spent killing for killing's sake.

It will be interesting to see how in-depth the EQ2 quest system is in 
comparison. *COUGH* Would anyone here have an idea about that? *COUGH*

I'll agree that the initial looks are 1 per race is going to be the 
extent of a totally unique experience.

You can't do that, because the quest givers ! icon turns grey and they 
won't give you the quest if it is out of the level range.

DAoC has a lot of good things to it, but their grind to 50 is way WORSE 
than the EQ grind to 50, and the game itself makes that unforgivable, 
because you cannot really participate in RVR unless you are at the 
higher end of levels.

Now when I played at release it was great, because we all did RVR 
starting at level 20 and had a blast, but now it would be suicide.
