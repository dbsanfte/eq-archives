Mana is based on wisdom, so increased wisdom *will* give you more
mana, though there isn't a consensus on the exact formula.

The formula is based in part on your level, so added wisdom at high
levels improves your mana more than the same wisdom at low levels.

The general rule of thumb is that before level 20, you're better off
spending your money on items that directly add to your mana. After
level 20, investing in wisdom items gives more bang for you buck.
