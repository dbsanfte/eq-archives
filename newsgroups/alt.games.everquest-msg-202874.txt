<<<<<Thanks to the KEI fix my Enchanter is now wanted to group with.  For the
most part, about 85% of the time, I've had to solo him up to near lvl 23,
but now people want to group with me to help their mana regen.>>>>>>>>>>>>
That's a shame but it is also helpful to you as you when you eventually find a
group you can put those people on your friends list and then you'll have cool
people to group with.  It's kind of a weeding out process as I'm sure you
wouldn't want to group with the idiots that don't want someone without KEI in
their group anyway.

<<<<<<snip uninteresting story>>>>>>>>

<<<<<<<<<All I have to say to those who are whining about the loss of KEI and
other
uber nerfs.... learn to play the game!  Make do with what you have and learn
to do with what you don't.  When you get a good group who knows how to
utilize all the abilities of the members, you can take down more mobs than
you can ever thought was possible, KEI or not.  When you've killed all the
mobs, you med.  Just like before.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Doesn't have to be that way we found out.  It was fun not having to med so
much.  Wasn't it?  And the argument that people who liked KEI need to learn the
game is ridiculous.  The game isn't that hard.  I learned the game long before
people could get KEI and it was just more fun with it.  That simple. 

 <<<<<<<<<<<<< Without KEI your more "in tune" with the
spawn rates of the mobs.  I grouped yesterday with 2 or 3 others, and we
were using my breeze.  Sure we had to med more, but when the tank went to go
pull a mob, it was there!!  We didn't have to waste extra time sitting
around because we were ready and the mob haven't spawned yet.  Without KEI,
we had a steady stream of monsters to kill, we never had to run cept once
there at the end when he pulled from upstairs and 8 came with him, and we
played better together as a group.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This argument has to be the best, you sat on your ass medding long enough so
that you didn't have to wait for mobs to pop.  That's a hilarious argument. 
What if there were more mobs around and  you were ready and could actually do
more fighting, what would you do then??

<<<<<<<One last thing... wondered if anyone has heard of tradeskills?  What do
you
think you can do while you med?  I've got a solo wizzie to 14 whos tailoring
is low 60s cause while I'm medding, I'm sewing.  Now this doesn't apply to
all tradeskills, but most you can carry what you need with you and while you
med.. work on them.  Learn some time management.

-NS>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Some people find tradeskills to be mind numbing nonsense.  I'd have a tough
time disagreeing with them.
