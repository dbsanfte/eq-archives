Doing something with the Aviaks.  When the game first came out mobs
could not go thru walls and people would cast spells on Aviaks or
Centaurs thru the huts and they would never attack you.  I was warned
for that my first day in the Karanas.  Not just first day but first
time I casted on Aviak thru hut and it did not walk around like I
thougth it should.  I had not idea.  That is why GM's give warings.
That was almost 2 years ago on a differnt server.  I hate to think I
could get banned at my next warning because of something I did not
know was bannable.

Warnings should be wiped after a year, espeically when a lot of
warnings involed issues that have been corrected with a little
programming skills by VI.
