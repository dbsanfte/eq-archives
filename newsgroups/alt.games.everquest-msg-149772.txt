Autosplit heavily favors the person looting, who gets any cash except
that which is evenly divisible by the number of people in the group.  Try
the math sometime, you'll be amazed at how heavily it favors the looter,
who may be getting three or four times what everyone else is.

Alpha loot is fair, although it doesn't guarantee balance, since someone
may get favored by luck... or worse, the puller may deliberately manipulate
what he's pulling, so mobs with visible loot or higher level (likely better
loot) are killed when its going to be his turn.  MT can do this too,
if multiples are being pulled.  Alpha Loot also means casters have to
get up off their butts to loot bodies, which is a waste of valuable med time.

Master Loot is the most fair of all, and the most efficient.  The only thing
wrong with it is it requires trust and honor.  But if you have a rogue in
the group, its practically required, since you are already forced to rely
on the rogue's honor what with pickpocketing!   My life's experience
tells me that the best strategy when faced with this sort of temptation
is to clearly and obviously place trust in the dubious individual; if you
make an effort to prevent him stealing it makes him want to pit his
wits against yours, but if you place him in a position where its clear
its up to him whether to steal or not, most people will try to live up
to the faith you are placing in them.

At worst, a ML rogue has no more opportunity to steal from the
group than any other ML would.  If you have someone else ML,
then you have two potential thieves!  And of course no other loot
system is really worth considering, as they slow down kills per hour.
