I'm guessing that you don't play on a PvP server.  If you play on one
of them it can be a real pain trying to do a quest where people from
the opposite team are playing.  If you are solo then you often have to
leave the quest until later.  I was trying to do one quest for more
than a week before I found the area I needed to be in to be empty of
Horde.  Of course, I chose a PvP server and I could just as easily go
to a non-PvP server if it becomes too much of a problem.  I really like
PvP when its on my terms (I like one-on-one rather than the mayhem of a
raid)

You _can_ do that but there are lots and lots of messages in the
General channel asking where NPC X is even though the quest info quite
clearly says exactly where it is.  In the starting place for the night
elves there were endless calls asking where the dryad woman was (SW of
the big tree - as the log said) and where the guy near the spiders was
(near the spider cave - not in it as some people seemed to think the
quest info said).  It does get less and less as you move onto the
higher level zones though.

That's the same for me plus I'm a leatherworker so about half my stuff
is crafted.  I really like that aspect of the game.  I did a bit of
"twinking" by passing on some crafted armour and a couple of daggers
that my higher level character had found and it was very unsatisfying
to complete an important class quest and then sell the the reward
because I already had better.
