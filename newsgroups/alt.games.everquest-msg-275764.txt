Please don't toppost here.

Necros are arguably the best solo class in EQ.  They can solo all the way 
to level 70 and collect AAs at a pretty astounding rate.  Bards used to 
be better, but, with changes a while back, I believe they have fallen 
behind, not sure.  A well played Enchanter is also awesome.
