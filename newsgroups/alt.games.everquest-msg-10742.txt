No. It is not "yours" unless a) you hit it, or b) it hit you.

There are no other qualifications. It doesn't matter if you are closest to
it. It doesn't matter if it's chasing you. It doesn't matter if you've been
looking for it for the past 72 solid sleepless hours. It doesn't matter if
you and 41 of your closest friends have all been twiddling your thumbs since
Tuesday waiting for it to spawn.

If you haven't hit it yet, and it hasn't hit you yet, it's fair game. Get
used to that idea, and learn to deal with that fact gracefully, and you may
find that people are generally gracious in allowing you to keep "camps" and
"spawns" as a matter of courtesy.
