Almost. All 4 the warders most be down at the same time and the sleeper is
awoken.
Problem is that once the sleeper is awoken, it won't go to sleep and the
warders won't repop. Considering the warders drop serious gear (primal
velium) you don't make yourself popular by killing all warders. For
reference check Darkwind on the AB server which was a 100+ lvl 60's guild
who all suddenly went /anon after they did it (and most of them remain
/anon).

Good sport is to simply skip the first warder and go for the last 3 who have
better loot then the first anyway.

Ps. The warders are in Sleeper's Tomb which can be accessed from Eastern
Wastes in Velious. You need the key first though.
