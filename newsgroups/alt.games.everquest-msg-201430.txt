Just to verify the mobs that drop the keys:

First Floor: A Large Undead Gnoll drops a crystal key. 
Second Floor: An Angry Librarian drops a three-toothed key. 
Third Floor: An Enraged Shadow Beast drops a frosty key. 
Fourth Floor: Cara Omica
Fifth Floor: Enraged Relative
Sixth Floor: Vhal'Sera drops
Seventh Floor: Tserrina drops Tserrina's key

You need to use the key before it will go onto your keyring. To view a
list of keys currently on your keyring you just gotta type /keys.
