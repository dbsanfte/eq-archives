i have heard rumors its one of the newer wizzy spells which is an AoE TL to
bind point,  but wouldnt that have a diologue box?  same thing happened to
me, and right before it happened  there was indeed a 65wizzy who was casting
a spell, maybe a bug with the box that if you dont click yes b4 it poofs
when it poofs you get tls anyway?
