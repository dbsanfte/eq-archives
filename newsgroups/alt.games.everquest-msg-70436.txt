  A more considerate way for them to have worked the refund would have
been to simply freeze the accounts and characters once the refund has
been given.  Then, in order to reactivate the account at a later date,
the person would either have to pay an amount equal to (or slightly
greater than) the amount refunded based on the cost of the software
(though they wouldn't have to give back the refund for service fees
they paid)... or require the person to supply a new account key to
reactivate the old account.
