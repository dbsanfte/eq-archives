I must have missed a post - I didn't see anyone give that as a reason.  And
since you bash people for misquoting, twisting words, etc ( almost ALWAYS
because they DID ), I -know- there must have been a post where someone said
"the reason is because".  There were a couple "Why not?"s - maybe that was
what you were referring to.  Can't tell, since you didn't quote anyone.  So,
that would make your reply a general reply to everyone who answered your
question of "Why?", which includes my reply.

But, since your newsreader didn't pick up my reply with my reasons ( going
by the time you replied -vs- the time I put my reasons out there - hours
difference ), I'll summarize for you:

1) I am not interested in the standard Exp Grind and Farming
2) Adds flavor to conversations, especially when you are requesting
something from someone
3) My Guild-mates are interested in languages, and now I can provide them
with -any- of the ones in the game
4) Adds diversity to the game - I looked at it like a mini-quest
5) If they ever make languages useful, I'm prepared
6) You can make money from it, if you are the type that charges for such
things

While killing Mammoths in EF last night ( during med time), I trained a
Guild-mate up to master in several languages.  Instead of that, we -could-
have sat there listening to the drivel of the idiots arguing about how much
damage a specific warrior can do with weapon X after he / she has
this-and-that Uber Shaman buff - but we preferred not to.
