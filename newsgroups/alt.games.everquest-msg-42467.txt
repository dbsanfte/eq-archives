I have to agree.

I'm having more fun grouping post-50 than I did earlier. My group spells
aren't the best, BUT If a Shaman isn't in the group I have a decent Strength
buff.

If a Cleric is absent my Skin line helps a little.

If a Mage isn't around my Spike DS does 26pts dmg for every mob hit (and
when a mob hits your melee folk 20 - 30 times that adds up!).

 If an Enchanter isn't around..ummm...I'm screwed (Clarity addict = / ).

I've found the key to post-50 grouping is your reputation. Druids have to be
very good at evaluatiing situations and throwing their resources where they
are most needed. If your groups consistently survive dungeon crawls you will
be looked upon as an ally.

This means:

Watching the Enchanter and Cleric, if they are getting hit they can't Mez
and Heal - If the tanks are occupied Snare and Root the extra Mobs. Be sure
a Tank doesn't need a heal immediately! If the Cleric looks like they can
withstand a few hits, heal the tank then get the Mob off the Cleric.

Have Evac up at all times. If a train comes through, you may be the first to
see it and Evac always takes longer to cast than you think... (always ask
first - the group may feel they can handle the train).

Keep the party Regen and DS buffs at all times.

Call every single Snare via a Hotkey. If the Mob is resisting, call that
too. Heck, I call my DoTs to show I'm actually causing some DMG LOL.

Call Mana status frequently.

Use /assist. DoTing the wrong Mob can be dangerous to your party's health.

Anyway, I'm having a blast in OS and Plane raids. I have no problem getting
groups or invitations to Raids. When I'm not grouped I port folks elsewhere
for free. It sucks to be stuck somewhere and not have a way out. Druids take
this for granted or charge ridiculous fees to do something that takes 5
minutes max.
