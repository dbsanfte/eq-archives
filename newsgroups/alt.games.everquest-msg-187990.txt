    This is my place to eat crow. I wasn't familiar with how Google works,
and did not realize that you hadn't linked the quote you wanted to use
directly. My bad for not searching around to help you prove your point. But
to get back to things....

    So you read a post by someone else that got what a ZEM is WRONG, and you
know all about it, huh? /chuckle - sucks to be you.

    Why would you, when you were wrong? Why show that you were ignorant
then, and still ignorant now?

    And, as I've pointed out, in both your examples you were wrong about it.
So yeah, you knew allllllllllll about it.

    Do I need to quote the "IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DEFAULT, MORON" thing
again? Or the "DL has a ZEM?" You are guilty of every misconception I've
pointed out.

    Actually, you bashed Ben Haddick because he used a math formula when he
corrected you. I pointed out that bashing him for the math formula, which
you did, was pointless because to an outsider all EQ players are geeks.
Including you, whether you know what the hell you're talking about or not.
Nice weasel job, indeed.

    Agreed. But your general terms WERE WRONG. You thought there could be a
zero modifier - WRONG. You thought there was a default modifier - WRONG. You
thought the ZEM was something that increased XP over and above "regular"
XP - WRONG. To use your gravity analogy, which you are so fond of, it's like
saying that every object has a "default" gravity, and mass creates an
additional modifier to that. So saying "I knew in general terms what a ZEM
is about", when you were wrong on every particular you quoted, is, get ready
for it, WRONG.

> And I
> have proven that, with links, which of course you couldn't follow

    Again, my apologies. I assumed you would link directly to the material
that would support your case, and assuming you'd do anything with even a
modicum of intelligence is clearly wrong. And when you DID finally show
direct quotes, they showed you listening to someone who got it wrong and you
correcting someone who got it right. Great "proof", Einstein.

> I don't give a shit. I'm an asshole, perfectly willing to accept it.

    On this, we agree.
