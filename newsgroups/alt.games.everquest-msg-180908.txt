Not sure, but they're definitely out there.

He's probably trying to browse one of those idiots who were piled atop
you in the item I snipped (tho how you target a gnome by accident I
don't know), OR, some ass right near you was Invis or hidden and he
was trying to open hi up anyway.

My favorite was some idiot who bought out all my mule's silks and
pelts, yet whined at great length about how I was a rip-off and
he didn't really need my silks.  He was, of course, of a level to
easily earn 5x to 10x what he spent on my goods in the time it'd
take him to farm them himself.

There now, I'll bet it felt good to let all that out.  :)

Not too bad, I give it a 7.5.
