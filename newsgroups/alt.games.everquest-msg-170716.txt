At the rate it's moving right now, I'd say even February might be
optimistic.
:-p.

Then again, I'm a pessimist by nature. After new years, they may just
get it working slam bang peachy in a week or so.

However, it does get a bit tiring finding that every time you log in, a
rollback has wiped out your last three yellows of xp and all  your
tradeskill skillups. 

/sigh

Yes, yes, I know, it's Test, so I'm not raising a fuss. But my, it can
get frustrating at times.
