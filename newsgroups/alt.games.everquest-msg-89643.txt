Can anyone confirm this? I've always steered clear of KC for the same reason
as the OP. Don't often use outpost but don't want to be KoS there if I need
to.
Some of the Drolvargs (the first ones) are amiable to me but further in it's
a different story, always assumed anything living in there would hit VS
faction (yes I had heard that VS himself doesn't seem to hold a grudge on
you killing him)
