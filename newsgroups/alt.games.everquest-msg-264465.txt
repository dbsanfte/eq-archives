Is that a threat? Well, if it is and you are planning your diabolical
scheme of posting more, especially if they are going to be responses
to large posts like Bob's:

1. Delete text you're not directly responding to
2. Post underneath the text you are directly responding to 

If you decide not to follow those friendly suggestions, I have one
other: read up on that "Newbie: I have a newsgroup term question"
thread (in comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg, not alt.games.everquest). You'll
be seeing the term being discussed inside a lot.

I'd give you links to the usenet FAQs but the page seems to be down at
the moment. To make do here is a different one:
