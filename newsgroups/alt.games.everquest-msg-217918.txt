Ok - I grant you some melees will have learned to run around hitting
every mob once instead of staying on one mob. At least they won't have
learned to run for the zone unless told to do so.  

They may not understand why they do it and may have horrible skill
with some weapon types, but I disagree that they have squat for
skills. They have defense skill; dodge/parry/block skills; perhaps
kick or slam or bash as they are another way to get the reuired
damage; at least one weapon skill should be high as they were probably
swinging some weapon at the mob to get their point of damage; and they
should have good taunt skill to keep the mob off the person power
leveling them.
