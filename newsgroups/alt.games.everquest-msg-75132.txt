Some of the best XP in the game came between 46 and 51 when, for 3
days running, we put together a group with 2 necros, druid, mage,
wizard, rogue, first in dreadlands, then doing hornets in Burning
Woods. At 51, we did the giant fort in EW with necro, wizard, warrior
for a while.

When we were scattered for a while and had very few friends on, we
would do Sergeant in Chardok with 2 SKs, 2 druids, a shaman, and a
rogue and N/G in OS with Warrior, SK, druid, shaman, necro, bard.
