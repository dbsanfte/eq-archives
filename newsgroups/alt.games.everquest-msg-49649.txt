OK, its not so hard... but here it is.

Get your high level character in the same zone where
your low level character wants to hunt.  The low
level one logs on and finds a partner, preferably
lower level than himself.  Log the high level character
in and buff the partner to the gills.  Log the low
level character in and help your partner kill stuff that
the two of you should -not- be able to handle.  Reap
the phat exp.  Repeat as needed.

Better, find someone else doing the same thing; your
lowbie gets their high level buffs while their lowbie gets
your high level buffs.

Why is this the hard way?  The easy way is to get a second
machine, second account, and have your main buff your
alt... even keep him company in overwatch mode as needed.
Heck, with this plan a high level warrior can PL you, by dragging
single pulls to the zone, almost killing them, and then zoning out
so you get the kill.

imagine my partners' surprise when they died and I logged
in my alt to res em.
