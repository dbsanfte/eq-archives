Well... people ask questions for all sorts of reasons, not always because
they don't know the answer.

I also think you are slightly wrong. You don't seem to ever get a choice to
agree to a new one.

"Such amendments shall be effective whenever we make the notification
available for your review."

The above is from the EULA. It seems to say that, no matter whether you
click on "I agree" or not, you are bound to the new one. All they have to
do, to make an amendment, is make the notification available for your
review.

Which makes the whole thing a bit strange.

Why do they have a button that says "Decline" when you cannot decline, and
why have a button that says "I agree" when it makes no difference whether
you agree or not?
