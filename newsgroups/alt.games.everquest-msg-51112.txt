Not perhaps, Certainly.  the time when that statement is true, is within
5 minutes of the server opening.  Someone who has made it on their own,
will do so again.  And with proper planning, experience, and skill,
anyone can join that group.  One person with 4 friends on a new server
can make 60 in a little short of twice the time it takes on a "mature"
server.  Why does it take so much longer?  Well, primarily because of
newbie zone saturation and it taking hours instead of minutes to make
level 5.  But, in every newbie zone area, there are still places to
hunt.  On a new server, with access to a tank and a healer, I can make
level 5 in under an hour, with any choice of race and class, because
there are "newbie" zones that are unknown or ignored on every continent,
for every race class combination.  The only exception AFAIR would be
evil erudites. and Even in that case, It is a short boat ride to the
nearest EMPTY newbie zone.  Further, once you get out of the newbie
"rut"  There is no competition for Mobs, No trains in popular dungeons,
etc.  And a soloist, will level as fast as they can kill.
