The huge bear sounds great. I think I'd be bumming too if my alligator 
was more like a little lizard. I think Iksars themselves are cool but a 
"scaled wolf?" What the hell is that?

I've been thinking about the faction thing with evil races. I've been 
thinking who cares about faction really in general if you aren't 
interested in playing tourist in the old world, visiting cities. If I 
was an Ogre, who cares if I can't tiptoe through the trees in Kelethin? 
People have been telling me faction isn't that big a deal. I think I'd 
like having a big bear instead of a wolf or tiger, although I do like 
those too. Decisions... decisions...

When you get to high levels can you kill guards and go wherever you feel 
like or are you always unable to visit some places? I don't know how 
much that matters to me but I am just curious. It would be very cool to 
visit a place where you are KOS and lay some serious hurt on the guards 
then just stroll right into town. :-)
