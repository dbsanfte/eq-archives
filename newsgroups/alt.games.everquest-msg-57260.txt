Hi again Conrad,

I do hope at least one of them works but I'm still going to walk I
think just to let them know what a shoddy trick this was to pull on
subscribers without even having the decency to announce it.

I hope a lot of folks go elsewhere and they get a message. I'll be
'phoning them today to tell then exactly what I think and telling them
I'll be talking to Trading Standards about it as the guy from France
said they were forced to withdraw it there.

B.B.
