I have done most of my teens soloing in the area around Gnollslayers
-- wolves, bears, and the like. I then moved to the Oracle Tower
->Windstalker regions --thicket lizards, basilisks, more bears,
vipers, Calthoris mages, knights, and clerics, those stalker things.
You can also solo gnoll battlers behind Ardent Needle.

I'd say I earned 75% of my level 15-20 XP soloing in Antonica. There's
plenty of places to fight if you bother to look. Of course, it's
easier to whine on a message board that there isn't a magic pixie who
leads you to every single soloable creature in the game. Perhaps
they'll add that feature.

See above.

Ten? A bit much. :) You're asking for twenty quests over a three-level
period. I did primarily guild writs for the local wildlife. You can
also do highwaymen when they go green, and anything involving killing
Calthoris critters. Any of your tradeskill quests can also be soloed.
I'm currently doing the Steppes, so those quests are fresher in my
mind. There's the Book of Three Keys quest (something like that, can't
remember the name) you get in the mage tower, the kill 25 undead
settlers quest you can get in the docks (go all the way to the back),
the infinitely repeatable Trapper Borgus and 'finishing the job'
quests, and probably a lot more I haven't found yet. Plenty of people
want you to whack beetles, birds, snakes, crabs, and the like -- you
just need to look for them. Or check out Allakhazams.

You can also solo the catalog and tour quests. And, of course, the
collection quests, which can have very nice rewards. 

The blurp you quoted said there WERE quests -- it didn't say how many.
Yes, solo quests are sparse, but they are not non-existent, and a lot
more are being added RSN. Many city tasks can be soloed repeatedly --
no XP, but status point rewards which can be helpful.

So, in short, you have yet to find a 'lie' anywhere in the blurp.
Unless you can find me an official Sony quote which specified a
specific NUMBER of quests for solo players. Got one?
