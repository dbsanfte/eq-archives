Errm, Perhaps I was not clear.
I ment for levels 1-10 don't let it recycle on death.
Other wise you can kill afew HT /LoH for a bonus few kills, then die to
recycle.
With no real penalty.

Sure if you are 51 then you are not going to want to die just to recycle
you timer, but if you are level 4 then why wouldn't you ?
