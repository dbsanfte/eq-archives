Dont make a coprse outside of VP untill the raid is over and people are
leaving. The 3 hour res timer will be long over by the time the raid is.
There are 2 zone outs. 1 past Silverwing and Hoshkar(probably the hardest
dragon in the zone because of certain factors involed in fighting him) and
another dragon but I forgot which one. The second zone out is behind Phara
Dar.

If it's your guilds first time there dont expect to be using the zone out on
the first day. And I'd have everyone, and I mean everyone, bind in the same
location. Somewhere like Gfey or Freeport where there is a good area away
from guards that some people may be kos to where you can bind. Having
everyone bound in the same zone makes extraction less of a hassle abd go
much smoother.
