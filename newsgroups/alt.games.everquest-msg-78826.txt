I had someone give me this, and up to this point, it has been an ok weapon
for my enchanter. However, I notice, since gaining levels, that it seems to
be diminishing in effectiveness (like most weapons!). I'm using it primarily
because I'm still hunting wisps for the cash. I have a FSGreat Staff, but I
can't hit them with it. My question is, what weapon should I buy, beg,
borrow or steal for my 13 enchanter? Should I keep this one and continue to
use it? After all, I still nuke the mobs (though I do like to pound on them
a bit :) ) and my pet generally kills them. It just seems that there has to
be something better out there. And she's been using this weapon for about 4
levels. She really needs to get her skill up in another, I know.

Anyone have suggestions as to which weapon would be best, and if they're
part of a quest, some vague instructions on how to do it? I'm still not yet
Kunark enabled (hope to be tomorrow -- ahh, shit... looking at watch
...today) But she does have some cash -- not much, about 100pp -- so I
*could* buy one if absolutely necessary and it met my budget!

I'd appreciate any input anyone had to offer!

TIA,

(Oh christ, I have part of the theme to LoTR stuck in my head!)

Thanks for playing.
