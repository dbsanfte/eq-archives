I wonder if my chars are bugged in some way. I just took my 22 cleric to the 
field of bone and made 12 kills of dark blue mobs and it's xp bar didn't even 
move a single tick. Sheesh, U was hoping for some progress this weekend as I 
usually don't get a chance to play much due to health reasons and was making 
an exception due to the 2X XP. Oh well, tomorrow is another day :-)
