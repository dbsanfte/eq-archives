Well, more than one person said (in so many words) to me that "hi"
wasn't RP.  I don't try for an accent for 2 reasons: 1) I'm not sure
that my farmboy looking to become a knight has one any different than
mine and 2) I don't have the linguistic skill to create a consistent
one to begin with.  I don't talk about outside stuff on Silverhand,
or on any server in the general channels. I don't use general to argue 
about what general should/shouldn't be used for (talk about immersion
breaking)  And I do try to keep my character's origins and purpose in
life in the front of my mind.

If you're brogue is good, I congratulate you - it's not the easiest
thing, and particularly not day in day out.  Nor will I look at you
askance no matter what server you're on.  However, I see no way to 
convey the drawl of the folks I grew up with (rural Oregon), even though
I can speak that way (for comedic effect usually) - and I expect the
same courtesy from RP'ers for my characters pedestrian dialect.
