My enchanter is level 58.

Mesmerize, certainly.  An enchanter who can keep 3 critters asleep while
everyone is beating on the 4th is a godsend.  The hard part is getting folks
to know you can do this easily...get them to know what an "/assist key" is.

Tash - well, I honestly don't think it makes that much difference.  Mostly
what it does is piss of critters into attacking you.  HOWEVER, don't let
that stop you from casting it, just learn WHEN to cast it (around 95% health
is usually safe).  Lots of times I won't bother casting it at all unless I
know that the critter is going to give us trouble unless I do.

ROOT!!!!   Your fastest casting Root will save your life more often than Mez

Mem Blur (has a decent chance to make the critter forget who it hates) can
also be damned powerful.  Keep in mind that ALL "mez" spells have a chance
of mem-blurring a critter, so actually having Mem Blur up may not be all
THAT necessary.

Ok, regarding haste & slow.  Until your 20s don't bother doing either unless
you have mana to spare.  Slow is a mana hog and is a waste because critters
are dead in less than a minute.  Haste is also a mana hog doesn't last long
enough.  If you were 20 levels higher my advice would be quite different, so
PLEASE keep in mind that I'm talking about RIGHT NOW.

Until level 16 (Breeze) you'll likely find it hard to find groups because
way too many newbies (and twink alts) have no appreciation for what
enchanters can do. Or, they either don't know or care about assisting.
