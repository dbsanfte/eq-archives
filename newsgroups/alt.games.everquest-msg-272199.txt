So, is it safe to assume that if you elect to keep all three given buffs 
active all the time, it will drain your power more quickly? Otherwise, 
why wouldn't you keep them all up? They would always be active to 
counter any events that occur, and as you said, the combination would be 
better than any one.

Do I understand that correctly?
