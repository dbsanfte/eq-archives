So I've yet to be anywhere near a raid with my shaman, but I'm
starting to get up into that level of play.

It occurs to me now that shaman don't seem to stack well at all;
we have terrible heals, DOTs aren't really raid tools, our haste
is second tier and presumably you'd have the chanters doing haste
instead...

This leaves debuffing, slowing, and general buffing.

Buffing.  My experience with my cleric suggests that this is
generally done by the guy with the best buffs, not split up
amongst the rabble, unless there are several people with the same
exact buff.  Since at first I expect to be lowest level shaman in
the raids, I don't expect I'll be doing much buffing

Debuffing.  Well, again, you want your best.  And there aren't
tons of mobs out there anyway.  Perhaps you'd have your second
shaman do debuffs while the first does slows, in order to spread
out aggro and mana costs.  Is there a job here for a third shaman
though?  Heck, Mages get largely the same line of resist debuff,
so I'm looking at potential competition from them also.

Slows.  Well shaman have the best slows, no question this is
where the shaman becomes star.  But again, you want your best
slow, so whats the second shaman to do?

More debuffs; the cripple line of spells seems to get some use in
raids.  I've not found it to be worth casting in normal play,
except that some have suggested it would help me hold aggro if I
want to play sponge while rogue/ranger/monk partners slam into
the target's back.  Perhaps it really comes into its own only
when you are helping 30 people pound on a mob?  Or is it just a
case of the extra shaman wanting to contribute -something-?

Of course we can also send pet (marginal DPS compared to melee or
"pet class" pets, I think?) and nuke (our nuke damage output is
somewhere on the scale below that of clerics and above that of
warm toast).  With JBB (which I'm not likely to get for a long
long time to come, the twink money having run out long since and
frankly never having reached the hieghts that a JBB seems to
command on MT) this might be a use in lower level raids, but
barring that, I'm looking at being a distinct "also ran" as far
as DPS contribution goes.

The only other job I can think of (and it took me this long to
come up with it!) is spot healer.  Currently I have all the
mighty healing power of a level 19 cleric, but in just one more
level I'll rival a 29 cleric for the job (yeah, SHeal at
last!).   I also have Stoicism, which is terrible for emergencies
but a pretty nice deal as far as HP for the mana goes.  I can't
think anyone would actually pick a third shaman over another
cleric for this job, but my understanding is that there's a
shortage of clerics, so that the job of keeping people other than
the MA alive does often fall to the shaman's and druids out
there.

So does stacking in a third or fourth shaman really end up as
"well we couldn't find any more clerics who would come, so you
try and fill the gap, just do your best, and hey, remember you
don't need to survive, as long as a cleric lives we'll be ok"?

Not that this would be devastating news to me, after all, if I
really want to raid I do have my cleric.  And I can certainly see
the need for -one- (perhaps two) shaman on every raid.
Eventually if I keep leveling up, I'll -be- that shaman.  But at
the moment, I don't see my shaman as any more desirable than your
third warrior on the raid.
