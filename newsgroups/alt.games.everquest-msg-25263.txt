Then the warrior was an idiot for taking it, 7AC is nothing to write home
about for back slot, you can get a 7AC +5 str cloak for free in velious.
I could understand if the AC was over 10 but 7? Maybe he just thought that
he could sell it for profit or pass it on to a friend or alt, not realising
it was a No Drop item. Either way he now has a back slot item that is of
little or no use to him whatsoever (perhaps he's going to wear while
practising skills or languages)

CF
If any can think of any reason for a warrior to want such an item please
post, I certainly wouldn't bother rolling for it and looting it.
