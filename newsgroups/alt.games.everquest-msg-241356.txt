First, 2 boxxing is a recognized and approved form of play, so why
would sony seek to punish it? I started my 2nd box when Sony sent me
an account key in an email that said, more or less... "Hey wouldn't
you like to have your own cleric wherever you go... now you can..."

Second, I agreed that you shouldn't *build* leadership skills in a 2
person group... but merely that you should benefit from them. A two
boxer wouldn't even benefit from most of them... mark npc etc is
worthless to a 2 boxer... but a 2 person group could and should
benefit from them.
