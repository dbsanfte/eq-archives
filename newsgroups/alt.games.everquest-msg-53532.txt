Here is one of my biggest grips about the inspection. I usually sit in EC
selling. So I get inspected all the time. Like I said it usually does not
bother me but too many times it is followed by either. <beg on> Can I have
this or that</beg off> or even worse "How much will you sell the <insert
item you are wearing here>. Now beggars are in a class by themselves but I
hate to be constantly bombarded by a player to sell him a piece of gear I am
wearing. Some off these guys are relentless and want me to practically give
them the item. A form of begging but if a player is wearing the item then it
mainly stands to reason that they do not want to sell it. If the player
wants to buy that item and wants to make grossly lop-sided trade in the
favor of the seller then auction his trade to see if someone wants to accept
it. Don't pick out a player wearing the item and harass them.
