Terms like this are "psychobabble".  You either love them and thrive on them
and all their sublties and innuendos and implications (like me) or feel they
are vile beasts which should be banished from the world (like others).  In
this setting "self-actualization" refers to a situation where your baser
needs (food, shelter, warmth, sex) are met, where you're more complex needs
(self-esttem, trust) are met, and you have a full understanding of your
niche in the society around you, as well as how you impact and are impacted
by society.  IMO no one ever fully reaches this level.

Unfortunately, as is the nature with many aspects of the social sciences,
something like this is very very very difficult to test empirically.  There
have been many correlational studies done which indicate that those who have
committed serious crimes (rape, murder) tend to have fewer of their baser
needs met.  There have also been correlational studies done which seem to
indicate that those individuals who have made great advances in science,
medicine, business, etc tend to have more of the baser needs met.
"Self-actualization" is not a quantifiable state in an empirical nature.

Kohlberg (the name I couldn't remember earlier) developed a system of moral
development (http://www.nd.edu/~rbarger/kohlberg.html).  It's premise is
similar to Maslow in that if basic human needs are not met, and individual
cannot progress to higher levels of consciousness and understanding of the
world around one's self.

"negative actions" in this setting would be more along the lines of crimes.
PDA's, provided they are not disruptive to others, would not be negative.
Further, IMO Maslow would think along the lines that if the basic needs of
love, sex, and self-esteem were being met, such things as overt PDA's would
not be necessary.

Can't really give you numbers.  I can give you links to some further studies
along these lines, and some readings I really enjoyed on them.  They're all
in that "psychobabble" language though.  I just tell DH to treat it the way
I treat his "geek speak".  He talks about his ROM and DIM and stuff, and I
talk about self-actualization and perceptive reasoning.
