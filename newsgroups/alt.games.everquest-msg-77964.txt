I liked this part:

  BM: Without going into any detail, we believe we've nailed down the types
  of features and game mechanics that need to be implemented in upcoming
  third-generation games.

There was another Brad interview here:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/news/sdetail414.html?story=414
in which he said:

  I�ve a little more free time now than I had before, so I�ve been playing a
  lot of EQ on the Firiona Vie Role Playing Preferred server. I was very
  involved in coming up with the ruleset on that server, so my playing
  preferences fit in pretty well there.

I give you The New Vision(TM).
