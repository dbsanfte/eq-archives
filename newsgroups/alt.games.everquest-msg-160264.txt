What exactly is missing from Home compared to Pro?

I dont really see how networking and admin is relevant to EQ, but what
network support is/isnt there in XPHome?

I have a basic network at home, 3x win98 and 1xlinux, 1 of the machines is
acting as my gateway (2 nics) and they all go into my hub.

Im just about to upgrade with xphome (that was the plan anyway) but how well
is XP Home going to support my little network?   Some will still run 98 and
I use linux for work, so its going to be cross platform

How about performance with Home and Pro?
