David... I honestly think you're mistaken.

When I first saw the original quote on Lum the Mads' website I figured it
had to be some kind of mistake or malicious thing on Lums' part... so I went
out and got hold of a copy of the magazine in question to make SURE of
things for myself.

I didn't just skim through the interview... I read it several times to make
SURE I hadn't missed it if it were there... and it just wasn't there.
