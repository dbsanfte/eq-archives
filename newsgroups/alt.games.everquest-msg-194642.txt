If you dont have the cash to just buy a nice weapon, sure.  My main
swung one of these for a while.  (I did the quest several time while
doing the swiftclaw sash quest)  The quest doesn't take all that long.
 Make sure you collect the venom sack in the common lands before you
head to stonebrunt.  The claws drop reasonably often.  The only
problem you may have is with the other two drops you need: Bamboo
shoots and whatever the fruit that you need is.  Both need to be
foraged.  If you dont have this skill, you need to find someone to
help...  When you do get the two foraged items, you must be very
careful not to eat them.  They are food and if placed in the upper
left slot of your inventory (or further toward your upper left slot
than the rest of your food) you will automatically eat them.

Are you keeping your 2hs skill up?
