www.eqprices.com has no association with Verant or Sony, and thus there is
no guarantee that it is going to contain every item that exists in EQ.

www.allakhazam.com is a better resource, although it also has no affiliation
with Sony/Verant, at least for velium items. It has fallen significantly
behind on PoP and LoY items and is becoming less valuable as a place to find
out information about item stats and pricing.

> Does anyone know what its worth?

It is worth whatever price a buy and seller agree upon. The "going rate" on
every server varies. Allakhazam rates it as 2kpp average, but you are best
checking out the prices in the bazaar and/or your server's market channel,
try /join trade or /join market of /join buysell, or ask people in your
guild or in shout in a busy zone what the market/trade channel is called.
