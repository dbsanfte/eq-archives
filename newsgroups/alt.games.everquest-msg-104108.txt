I am very bright.  But that's not germane to the real issue.

The fact is, I've identified you as a person with very thin skin and low
self esteem.  You would rather insist you are right, all evidence to the
contrary, than to admit you were wrong and learn from your mistakes.  You
are what bullies look for on the playground, because you thrash and squirm
so entertainingly.  If it were my intent to troll, you would be target #1,
as you cannot resist the bait.

Personally, I hope to be "wrong" at least a few times a week for the rest of
my life.  I am improved by assimilating other people's points of view into
my own.  I figure I'm on course to get it 100% right about 45 seconds before
the moment of my death.  I will achieve total enlightenment on my death bed,
"so I've got that going for me," to borrow from a scene in Caddyshack.
Until then, I am a work in progress.  Which means that, although neither of
us is perfect, I am moving in the right direction and you are not.

Last thing.  You can type *plonk* all you like.  I will never know for sure
whether you have actually killfiled me, or if you will read my posts out of
curiosity, but not answer them becuase you are afraid you will humiliate
yourself, as you have done with others in the past.  So *plonk* away.
