Ok, let's try this again.  This time with the question.  I am in the Cat's
starting city on Lucilin doing the warrior newbie quests.  Right now I need
to find ore to make a shield frame, only after 2 days of searching and
asking, I cannot find any nor any info.  Bought the blacksmithing book from
the blacksmith shop, but it doesn't say where to get ore.  Anyone know?
