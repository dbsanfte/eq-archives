Stats and graphics are data.. they aren't objects in and of

data.

So.. a Blade of Carnage resides in the client software on your
computer... hmm.. so if you went to someone elses computer with EQ and
typed in your user name and pw, then you shouldn't be able to access
it. The only way you can access it from a fresh client that has never
accessed your account is if not only the account, but what makes a
Blade of Carnage a Blade of Carnage in game sits on the server
computers, and not the client. All the client is is a convenient
interface to it, and nothing more. So, who exactly are you gonna sell
this cache data sitting on the client to, and like the swamp land in
Florida, who would be stupid enough to 'buy' it?

First.. lets clear up some terminology. Data is not an object. An
object holds data(or properties) and methods to interact with that
data. I can guarantee you, when an item is transferred.. that the
ownership for that BoC has been removed from your access and has been
given to whoever you gave it to. You cannot get that back, you cannot
copy it, and any data that resides on your computer is useless to sell
because it cannot and will not give someone a BoC should you give it
to them. To quote Fight Club, you could stick feathers up your butt,
it doesn't make you a chicken. You could have all the 'data' you want
on your client it won't add up to a new copy of a Blade of Carnage, or
another, and another. You can't magically generate yourself BoC's from
that data to sell to other people. You sold your right to that BoC,
handed it off, and no longer have it as a result. You no longer have
that BoC in your possession and no matter how hard you try the client
'data' will not add up to the object unless you acquire a new one
through normal means in game on the particular server you reside. This
should seem intuitive to your normal first grade class.. that when you
hand something to somebody you don't get it back, but you seem to
belabor the point that somehow this now allows you to make endless
copies to be nefariously sold.

>A dupe bug isn't creating new data, it's adjusting data that always exists
>on your character. 

Actually.. a dupe bug is probably exactly what i laid out. A reference
that is accidentally held by more than one object causing two
serializations of the same item to occur when saving, adding a
duplicate item to the system. And it should be a duplicate in that
objects in the system should have unique ID's made upon creation when
a mob spawns. Your 10 millionth drop of the item should still have a
different ID than any other item in the game based on the string ID
field. That ID will be the same on both of these new objects that get
created the next time the character is generated. Heh.. in
programming, its not uncommon to forget to null out or overwrite a
reference to an object in memory when you set another object property
equal to it. Its actually insanely easy to do, especially with the
machinations and different combinations involved in just handing an
item to someone.

>As far as the server is concerned, all of your items are nothing more than
>flags on your character that tell it how it should adjust your performance.

And you simply do not understand object oriented programming. Yes, if
they've done it properly, there will be a physical instanced object
residing in the memory of the server and probably cached on the client
that will have the exact characteristics of a Blade of Carnage with
methods similar to those found on all weapons. To give a somewhat view
of it in C could, what would be going on is....

void Player::Got_Hit(int Damage Done)
{
	Hitpoints -= DamageDone;
	if (Hitpoints <= 0)
		PlayerDead = TRUE;
}

MJ.Target = &DarkTyger;
DamageDone = MJ.Primary.SwingWeapon();
if DamageDone != 0)
{
	DarkTyger.Got_Hit(DamageDone);
	if (DarkTyger.PlayerDead() == TRUE)
		DarkTygerCorpse = DarkTyger.Die();
	DrkTyger = NULL;
	MJ.Target = &DarkTygerCorpse
	MJ.LootCorpse();
}

In the actual program those methods would be triggered through
interface interaction.. click on DarkTyger to target him... hit F2 to
turn attack on.. etc. But the physical objects actually exist in
server memory and by no means are there just for show as some type of
'flag' to determine whether you have one or not. Even when you save to
disc, the objects still exist just in a flattened serialized format in
order to save memory space, but they still take up physical disc
space. You might call them 'virtual'.. but they are anything but. When
i refer to a Blade of Carnage.. and specifically one you have on your
account.. that is an actual object as real as your monitor, or even a
CD.

Its still does not a Blade of Carnage object make. Until the object
gets created you just have a pile of numbers useless to no one.

class Player
{
	string Name;

	void Set_Name(char *);
	Player(char *);
}; /* object prototype */

Player DarkTyger("Dark Tyger"); <----- An instance of the player class
Player MJ("Michael Johnson"); <---- Another
Player Whoever("John Doe"); <---- and Another.

.....

When you actually create an object it reserves space in memory for it
and calls the constructor. This is an instance of that object

DarkTyger != MJ because they aren't the same object instance.
MJ != Whoever because they aren't the same object instance.

You have 3 different objects sitting in memory, each of the same
class. When your BoC gets created it also gets its own instanced
object, and that object will be unique in the game. It should have its
own unique ID built on creation(i.e. mob spawn) and there should be no
other instanced item in game equal to it.

>The item exists on the client software, whether your character
>currently possesses one or not.

When your account loses the information needed to generate the BoC..
you do not currently posess one. I don't care if a picture of mother
theresa was in your data.. you won't and can't turn it into a new BoC
object.

>I still have the BoC on my system, I just can't USE it.

Guarantee you you don't. You certainly have data which could be used
in a BoC object.. but you don't have a BoC sorry. It would be like
saying you still had a 35mm film because you possess the film can or
even the reel but no film. Without the film its still not the movie,
regardless of what else you have. Without the ability to regenerate
the object in game upon login.. you simply do not have one nor can you
miracle one up without getting someone elses.. or a new one off AoW.

I sold my access to it, and while Sony could certainly point to the
EULA and ban both people who infringed the rules of their league... it
isn't illegal per state or federal law in any way, shape, or form. And
given the fact that if we take it as a given it not only exists on the
server.. but still does after transfer... if Sony feels their
copyright was infringed by me selling access to this item to someone
else.. all they need do is destroy it once the accounts got banned.

Just charge? Not against the law. The pool can toss you from their
premises per their rules. There are a lot of things that private
parties regulate that aren't against the law but against the rules of
the establishment. Being private parties they have the right to do it
and enforce it the way they see fit so long as their actions do not
infringe upon the civil liberties of the people involved.

You aren't exactly an expert. I've done programming professionally..

Their private property imo, owned and built by the company. I don't
view it as intellectual property because the term itself implies
something in the mind.. like the design to a new rocket. That's
intellectual property to me. The objects that make up the entirety of
Norrath on each server actually have physical locations and are finite
objects.

Hoho.. a contract lawyer now too.. you're spiffy sir. So... if my
daughter clicks I Agree for me every time I go to log in then I am
bound by contract. Clicking a button is no where near the same thing
as a signature. Even a signature is usually contested if you do not
have witnesses available when it is done.

>All the signature on a paper contract does is prove that you agreed to it,

Signature by itself doesn't prove a thing. An autopen could have
signed it or anybody with good forging skills. Contracts are almost
always signed with witnesses to be able to attest to the fact that you
did in fact sign and agree to it of your own volition

>it's not relevant whether you actually read it or not. Since you MUST

Once again.. we go for a moment and say i broke the EULA.. that
doesn't necessarily have recourse in state or federal law...
especially when the situation is solved by simply banning and deleting
the account. Are you claiming that Sony is so inept that they cannot
police their own product and must get the government to come up with
reasons by which they can charge these miscreant under whatever
copyright or IP property law they can try to shoehorn in to the
situation?

>(Even if you hacked it so it doesn't come up. The unmodified game
>requires that you go through the EULA, thus, it's considered "signed"

This just plain sounds weird and I would think you would find a hard
time enforcing it via state or federal laws. There are so many things
that have to go in to proving this, that, or the other under the law
and the last thing I think Sony would ever want is the government
policing their product.

Scuse me sir.. you are about to get owned in bold faced type:

HAHHAAHAHAAHAHA.. THEY HAVE TO TRANSFER THE ITEMS OVER
THE EVERQUEST SERVERS. THEIR PLAYERS ARE IN SONY'S WORLD. IF SONY WAS
SERIOUS ABOUT ENDING IT THEY WOULD TRACK THE TRANSFERS AND BAN THEM
AND THOSE THEY SELL TO. THATS ALL IT TAKES, ACCOUNTS GETTING BANNED BY
SONY TEND TO GIVE A WEBSITE/COMPANY A BAD REP. SO HARD TO TOUCH MY
ASS.
