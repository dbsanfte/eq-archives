Forgive me if I don't take seriously a Christian web site discussing
the Wiccan rede, especially if the author can't be bothered to run a
spell checker.

The entire site is nothing more than Christian anti-Wicca propaganda,
devoted primarily to promoting the usual Christian arrogance of trying
to foist their beliefs off on others.

He's right - it's ridiculous. And it isn't a valid example - it's
equating lack of intent with lack of harm, and they are different
things.

Lawless anarchy, in other words. Knock yourself out. Good luck.
