Hmm, myself and 3 of my friends have this motherboard.

Asus A7V8X/GLAN/USB2

I have a duron 1.2, someone else a xp2000, and finally the last has a
xp2400.

All are running with Crucial pci 2700 ram (256mb on the first two, 512mb on
the second).

Various hard drives, all using a geforce card of some kind.

All are running win2k pro.

There have been absolutley NO problems with any of these machines, in fact I
would say this is probably the most stable motherboard I have used for a
long while.

I have been building pcs for around 7 years, this is definitley one of the
best boards I have used.

You OS installition sounds more like a HDD error (jumpers, bios etc), than a
motherboard error.

I have put OS's on machines that are totally fubar, how you could have
issues putting one on a brand new mobo I dont know :) Set cd rom to boot,
put cd in, and all is good.... (98, 2000 and I expect XP should all boot
etc).

Then when you did finally get the os on, and games are crashing etc, is this
still a mobo error? Sounds more like driver issues to me, or device
incompatability (you really should upgrade that TNT :PP (non certified if
you are on XP = lose)), more than a mobo problem.

Of course your a tech so you know all this :)
