Oh, yes, I realized the teasing part.  I was not addressing the RV issue 
one way or the other.  The wireless internet I am talking about is not 
via cell phones, and, at least mine, is significantly cheaper than $75 a 
month.  Here is a link to a short description of what I am talking about, 
this one in particular is only applicable in northern Colorado, but, 
there may be other similar services where you are.  Figured it can't hurt 
to bring it up, worst case, is the answer is no.
