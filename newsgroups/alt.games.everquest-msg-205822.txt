Ahh.  You didn't REALIZE you could get free bow and arrows in blackburrow did
you?  My problem was not being able to afford enough bags to store the arrows. 
Even when gnolls were green I had to go kill them just for the free arrows.
The guy who started the thread was a true new player.  I would never suggest
tradeskilling as a way to "save money / get stuff" to someone who's just
started unless they are twinked.
