Clearly, VI is at least considering the notion (although now they
appear to be backing away from it a bit) that no, maybe not everyone
should have the right to camp everything.  It isn't a matter of
favoritism, it's a matter of keeping appropriate levels in appropriate
zones, and a more rigid implementation of the "no risk, no reward"
policy they have always espoused.  It isn't a notion without
precedent, nor a certain logic to it.

I believe someone elsewhere in this very long thread said something to
the effect that TCC might have been a good idea when the game first
began, but that it isn't now, and that may be correct.  Had TCC been
in place from the first, I think many more than now do would have
found it a logical, if perhaps not terribly "realistic," idea.

TCC isn't about stopping the farmers.  Its purpose is to lure lower
level players to underutilized zones.  See this link:

http://www.gamesdomain.com/gdreview/zones/previews/sep01/luclin.html

Given that that's the goal, then if they have stopped your honest
farmer from going to the zone, they have moved closer to achieving
what they wanted to.  Further, I doubt *every* farmer who is only out
for cash has two computers and two accounts.  Of course they can't
keep every high level player away from a mid-level zone, but I don't
think they're expecting an absolute solution to the problem.
