    They are a mess right now. RvR is all over the place, the amount of
content can't support the number of people there, it's just awful.

    Bah, I say, BAH! Even the non-elemental pattern mobs are dropping 110
HP/MANA FT V ranged items, or 110 HP/MANA Man Pres IV shoulders, or.... This
is not stuff to brush off as minor. And as you indicate later, you are
taking down some of the elemental mold droppers, too.

    The Earth rings are bugged right now. If you kill them at any time
except right after a patch, you'll get the PH. As for clearing to MA, where
did you start from after the last mob died? Our setup is to have Vine as the
last mob, take pre-tells on loot (he only drops elemental bracers), and have
a bard pull him to the Gator spawn point. That way you just have to clear
through the golem tunnels to get to MA, which should give you more than
enough time for one attempt.

    The AoE has a casting time, and you can see the casting message. Have
someone call it. Casters should be able to duck it, and clerics can actually
stay in with DA/DB for the first two before having to run like everyone
else. You'll need to SR against him and not CH, though, to give yourself
enough space to run when he starts to cast. That may present mana/numbers
issues.

    The minis in Air are pretty easy, and have good reward. The avatars
aren't fun. Some of the islands are still buggy, too. Same deal - only works
after the patch. Sigismond isn't one of the broken ones, although you'll
wish it was.

    If you need to farm stuff, farm Tier III. Ornate molds are still good
items, a lot of the other III drops are exceptional, and it keeps flags for
the guild very current.

    They died. A lot. You can get 2 drops in less than one hour just by
pulling and killing the relatively gimp charm chickens. Hell, I pulled one
of them last time (the SK in Pull hadn't memmed Harmshield, and with two
full immunity spells I was better at it anyways).

    One of the guilds on my server has a points system that stops
pointsflation cold. Points awarded to person X = total points value of all
items dropped divided by the number of people present for the kill. So the
total sum points of the guild stays exactly the same after every kill.
