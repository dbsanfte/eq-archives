Unfortunately, I have found that castersrealm has many errors in the spell
locations.  Recent examples, Paralyzing Earth is said to be available on
vendors in FV and OT.  In the case of FV, supposed to be the pally/cleric
building vendors.  Not the case, it is a research or drop only spell,
shaman, of course, do not get research, so I had to find someone of a
research capable class that gets the spell in order to get my copy.  Several
druid spells for level 19 were also incorrect, but I would have to check
which ones specifically again.  Most of the time they are correct.
