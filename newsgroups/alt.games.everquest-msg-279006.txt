True, until you get to Dubiously. There's another way to get Brood of Kotiz
faction.

Get a 5-dose Iksar illusion potion. You can farm Iksar blood in Dulak's Harbor,
and buy Wormwood from one of the vendors in the Gunthak lighthouse. Give both to
your favorite Alchemist and have your potions made.

Invis up, head to West Cabilis and find "an iksar hermit" in a cave near the
LOIO zoneline. Target him, run out of sight, click off invis and /con. You want
Dubiously at a minimum.

Once you're at least Dubiously then go back to West Cabilis and chug an illusion
potion. Go to "an iksar hermit" and /con. Anything less than Kindly means more
killing outcasts.

Once at Kindly (or better) then go back to West Cabilis, chug another potion,
and go see your friend the hermit.

Make a macro button with the following:

/say I am not a great sorcerer
/pause 22
/pause 22,/say I am not a great sorcerer
/pause 22,/say I am not a great sorcerer
/pause 22,/say I am not a great sorcerer 

Target the hermit and spam this macro. You�ll get A Flaxen Hilt (it�s a
container). It�s Lore, so you�ll get a bunch of "duplicate lore items are not
allowed" messages which you can ignore. However, you�ll also get Brood of Kotiz
faction for each /say. Put the Hilt into a general slot and keep spamming the
macro until you get to Ally status. Click off your Iksar illusion and /con. If
you�re Kindly or better you�re done with potions - otherwise chug another potion
and keep spamming for a while.
