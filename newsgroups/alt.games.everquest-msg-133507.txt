I'm a shaman and partner with a monk.  I usually heal and buff him and
my pet as well as debuff and slow the mob.  Well, I was wondering
even though the monk does most of the damage and I don't do any other
than the share my pet does, does that give my pet 50 percent of the
exp?  I'm gonna start using that club in my hand to test this but
wondered if someone had already figured this out.

thanks,

Silorm Fleetfoot of solusek ro
