I THINK I posted last night that someone finally got it through my head that
it was THIS CLERIC that I have a problem with, not clerical profits per se.
I'm not sure, it was pretty late yesterday when I remembered.

I will say that if a cleric is more uber than me (not hard) and just bought
the most expensive horse I'm likely to think that they regularly make out
like a bandit.  If a cleric looks like he's worse off or the same as me I'd
be more inclined to not worry about him getting some of my loot (after all,
I haven't been bothered YET, until this new guild guy) to cover past losses
(even though I still think it's his own responsibility I DO appreciate
clerics and don't mind helping most strangers).
