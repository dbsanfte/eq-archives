This isn't quite at your level but...

The guild I'm in is smallish (maybe 30 mains) and short of clerics, so we
were delighted to have a new 62 cleric join the guild a month or two ago.

Anyway, around a fortnight ago she deguilded and joined another guild,
basically because we would (in her words) never be able to manage Chardok
and finish her epic. Note that she had not, as yet, actually turned up at
any guild raids.

Well, this past weekend we broke into Chardok, killed the King (easily)
and one of the members sent her a tell linking the singed scroll. She
then sent a tell to one of the officers basically begging to be let back
into the guild. Oddly she didn't get a lot of sympathy - I don't think
a single person spoke up supporting her readmittance.
