OK biw I've done this every diferent way that people have listed here.  Went
step by step the way that was listed int eh last thread"what color...."
every time I get the masage that says "you must have both your race and
horse models on in order to summon your horse"  I have an Erudite
Necromancer and would like to get this to work.  Curantly I Quazy fix the
horses head by going to 3rd person rear(moveable) and adjust it so the
camara angle is about 2 - 3 clicks above me and locking 1click down.  The
only problem I have with this is about every third time I try to loot My
camara angle gets totaly screwed up and I have to cycle through the F9's to
reset camera then move it again.

I would realy like to get rid of the funky movement also.  Could some one
that HAs goten this to work do a detailed desription of the streps that they
went through to get it to work.

Thanks
Omiin
