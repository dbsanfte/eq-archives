1 DE Cleric (best rezes & heals)

2 Ogre SK (feign, tank, snare)

3 Vah Shir Bard (track, snare, charm, mez, semi-tank, buff/debuff, super
sow), Replace with Enchanter if no one wants to suffer carpal-tunnel
syndrome. 

4 Druid (sow, track, backup heal, port, snare, buff/debuff) Not sure the
best race for a druid, the only ones I've liked have always been wood
elves though.

5 Barbarian Rogue (hey you need one to get into some places, good for CR
as well, and tons of damage)

This is what i'd consider a perfect 5 person all the time group.

Obviously other combonations would work much better in many places, but
this will get you anywhere.
