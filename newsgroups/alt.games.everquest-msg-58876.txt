Subject: Is this a bug, or does it just suck bigtime?

I'm playing a Human Necro (level 6). I took the boat from Freeport, and was
attacked and killed by an NPC as soon as it arrived at its first stop (I was
AFK and forgot to hide; arrived back at the computer right as the boat docked).
 The NPC ran onto the boat and killed me.
  So after I respawned, I went and took the boat again; my body wasn't there.
It also wasn't on the dock with the NPC (I hid by sitting on the upper rear,
but could see the dock).

So is my gear and gold gone for good, or is this a reportable bug? I don't
really care about most of the gear and money I was carrying, but I want my
guild robes and food back.

(I want to switch to playing an Enchanter or Ranger for awhile, but want to
retrieve my Necro's gear first, if possible)
