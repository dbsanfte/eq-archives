Could not say for sure.  I suspect, based on some other diets I have tried, 
that a significant amount was due to simply drinking a lot more water.  No 
matter what diet I have tried, if I also consume significant amounts of 
water, that triggers the body to stop retaining water, and causes a 
noticable weight loss.  I will say that the zero carb diet I did was lower 
in calories than my normal diet, and that certainly had an effect as well.  
I am a candy fiend, and all that refined sugar adds up to a whole lot of 
calories.

I did not go on my current diet without first consulting my physician, and, 
his response was that the benefits of losing weight are greater than the 
detriments from most any diet, including the Atkins diet (near zero carb).  
There are probably those that would dispute that, but research seems to be 
indicating that he is correct.  Basically, he told me, find a diet that 
works for you, and go with it.

As with any diet, you should also include some type of exercise regimen, as 
that is a big help as well.
