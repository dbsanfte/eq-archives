In hindsight the book keying would work better as a per account not per
character system, and if you were new to Everquest - invising and sow and
running to each book - before level 10 would be a fairly large task, which
would still give you a good idea of the size and form of the Everquest
world.

The per account keying would solve this.  The keying system is really suited
better to making new players explore the world before being able to teleport
instantly.
