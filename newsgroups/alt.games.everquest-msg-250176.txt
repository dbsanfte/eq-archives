This is too funny watching SOE backpedal on one of its favourite ideas.
To little too late tho.
Heres a clue SOE: try fixing POP so smaller guilds arnt forever stuck at
tier3 and you might actually interest people.

Many guilds could do content in ele, but dont have the size to kill RZ. How
stupid is that.

Ditto emp and VT. While your at it speed up those luclin spawns.
