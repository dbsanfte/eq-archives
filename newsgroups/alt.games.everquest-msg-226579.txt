If enough people are buying it at $50 just to get into the beta for EQ2, 
then, obviously, to those people, it is worth $50.  For people, like you, 
who feel that $50 is too high, well, don't buy it.  I suspect they don't 
want to sell beta slots at $10 because it would cause too much interest, 
and, likely, they don't want that many people in the beta.
