LMFAO

One of my machines is as follows:

Athlon 1100MHz
512MB SDR RAM
GeForce4 Ti 4200 64MB DDR

very wimpy compared to what's available

Clip plane 20-30 (I keep it there most of the time anyway)
8 luclin models on - I've seen them all, they are boring now, I am only
concerned with how I look in my new gear
High res textures
Dynamic lighting
Velious armor all off (an amazing performance boost but you have to edit
eqclient.ini by hand)
mip mapping off or on, off is a wee bit faster and it's not all that great
an effect in EQ
texture caching on because it improves the throughput between system and
video RAM, or seems to anyhow

I have very little lag in the bazaar in first person mode, and absolutely
none at all in overhead view, except where 40-50 idiots are clusterfucking
their traders next to one of the banks.

PB
