REREAD MY POST.  THE PIECE I POSTED (look for it from a previous post) WAS
STRAIGHT FROM THE AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL ARTICLE IN QUESTION.  DID YOU NOT
SEE THAT PIECE?  OR DID YOUR FEAR OF BEING WRONG CAUSE YOU TO "SKIP" THAT
PART???

here is is AGAIN -

"Regulations governing detention in the Occupied Territories

Arrest and detention by Israeli security services in the Occupied
Territories are governed by a series of Israeli military orders which, for
years, have given the Palestinians of the Occupied Territories rights which
are inferior to the rights of Israeli citizens and breach international
standards for arrest and detention.

International human rights instruments lay down the following guarantees,
among others, to people who are arrested or detained. These guarantees must
be applied to all without discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex,
language, religion, political opinion, social origins, birth or other
status:

  a.. The right not to be arbitrarily arrested.
  a.. The right to be informed of the reasons for arrest.
  a.. The right of access to lawyers.
  a.. The right to inform or have informed their families of their arrest
and place of detention.
  a.. The right to be brought promptly before a judge.
  a.. The right to challenge the lawfulness of detention.
  a.. The right to have access to the outside world.
  a.. The right to be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent
dignity of the human person.

Few Palestinians living in the Occupied Territories who have been arrested
or detained by the Israeli security forces enjoy these rights. Palestinians
in the Occupied Territories (apart from those with Jerusalem ID cards)
arrested by Israeli security services are under a system of military
justice. The law which has governed arrest and detention of Palestinians
over the past 32 years has been Military Order No. 378. This order was
issued in 1970 and has been frequently amended. Palestinians may be arrested
without warrant and without ''reasonable suspicion'' that a person has
committed any criminal offence. The arresting body, the IDF or the Israeli
General Security Service (GSS)(2), does not directly inform families of
those arrested, but provides information to Israeli non-governmental
organizations such as HaMoked, Centre for the Defense of the Individual,
which families may contact (if they are aware of the organizations'
existence). Until 1994 those arrested could be held for up to 18 days
without judicial review; in 1994 the period without access to a judge was
reduced to 11 days and in 1997 it was reduced to eight days."

and that was from the very AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL article that is in question
(look for the link and go back there!).
Is this fair treatment?  Amnesty International doesn't seem to think so
(read the piece to see why!).

>Like most
> of the rest of the world, I recognize Noam Chomsky as
> a crackpot.  I don't care.

yes, he's a "crackpot" to the corporate leeches he speaks out against.
yes, he's also a "crackpot" by those who blindly support this gov't (and
their support for these parasite corporations) and value pride over truth.
If you truly believe he is a "crackpot" (as you recognized him), WHY DON'T
YOU TRY TO DISPROVE HIS CLAIMS AND PROVE THAT HE'S A "CRACKPOT"???!!!!! HIS
SOURCES ARE CLEARLY STATED AT THE BOTTOM.  Go ahead!
Is it your fear of bring wrong that is holding you back?  if it isn't, THEN
PROVE IT BY PROVING HIM TO BE THE "CRACKPOT" THAT YOU RECOGNIZE HIM AS!  If
you can't prove him wrong, then who is the "crackpot"?  The one who is
proven right, or the one who is filled with senseless, misinformed beliefs
(your belief that he is "crackpot")?  You know what senseless, misinformed
beliefs are?  BULLSHIT.  IT SEEMS AS IF YOU CAN'T DISPROVE HIS CLAIMS AND
YOU'RE AFRAID THAT HE MAY BE RIGHT.. so you spit out this BULLSHIT.  Is this
why you refuse to acknowledge his claims - the BULLSHIT you present?  If
he's a "crackpot", then PROVE it!  If this claim of mine is wrong, simply
prove it by disproving his claims.  Don't claim he is "crackpot" when YOU
CAN'T PROVE HIM WRONG.  That only makes you look like an even bigger
"crackpot" than you claimed he was!  You claimed you recognized Noam Chomsky
as a crackpot.  PROVE TO ME THAT WASN'T BULLSHIT BY ACKNOWLEDGING AND
DISPROVING HIS CLAIMS.
(again, he lists his sources at the end of his article)

seeing that i've actually reposted things several times due to the
negligence (or is it fear - as noted earlier?) of some of the other
misinformed/senseless debaters (such as yourself - see the first parts of
this post ), and argument continues without credible support from them
(bullshit - such as your Chomsky belief mentioned above)... this thread has
now PROVEN to be a true waste of time and nothing near true debate.  You
claim that Noam Chomsky is a "crackpot" ("recognized as" in your words)
without giving a single piece of evidence to support that!!!!!  Given this
fact, your claim cannot be regarded as anything but bullshit.  I've
presented my argument, its support, acknowledged your claims (see the top of
this post as well as the many other posts), and i've even given you two
"challenges" that you refuse to acknowledge and analyze thoroughly and
completely.  My work with this thread is done, and i will not be wasting any
more time to respond to stubborn/senseless posts (such as your's and many
others) within this massive thread.    Like I said before, i can deal with
the ignorant, but i will not waste my time on the stubborn and senseless.
All this is proof of the stubborn/senseless - and I simply don't have the
time to waste on people like that such as yourself.  This has become nothing
more than me debating with a child.  If and when you feel you have a truly
intelligent post to share (including replies to both of my "challenge"
posts), I'll be more than happy to hear it - you can find me at
alt.music.tool .  Just post a new thread.

Good night.
