Criminal law _is_ legislated morality.  Morality is a set of rules to
make a society work.  The "Ten Commandments" provide rules for a basic
moral system.  A law assigning punishment for committing murder
(prohibited in this ruleset) is legislated morality.  Has nothing to do
with whether the laws are "good" or "bad", controversial or popular,
you see?

Your comment was rather terse, and so I am left to speculate as to what
you were driving at, but I suspect you are arbitrarily excluding all
but a very narrow range of actions (sex for hire, gambling, use of
intoxicants, that sort of thing?) from consideration in a moral system.
If you take some time to think about it I expect that you will see that
a moral system restricted to such a narrow part of human affairs would
not be very useful as a guide to behavior, which is why, to the best
of my knowledge, no such moral system exists or has ever existed.  In
other words, morality has to do with everything human, not just the
work of your local Police Department's Vice Squad.
