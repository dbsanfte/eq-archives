I believe you are correct about video card bottlenecking you in
old UI.  My understanding is that you do not want to use new UI
with less than 384MB system RAM.  I don't think you're likely at
all to be CPU bound, main source of lag attributable to system
seems to be texture caching (i.e. it's all about RAM) and maybe
rendering to some degree (i.e. older video card might be slower
even with adequate memory).   You might consider a 128MB video
card, I'm not sure if EQ would make effective use of it but it
seems likely to be a longer lasting investment (i.e. it would
migrate nicely into an as yet hypothetical replacement system).
