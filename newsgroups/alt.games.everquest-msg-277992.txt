Not to mention the fact that its now a form of gambling. 

Step right up, step right up: Kill a mob, win nothing, tokens worth a 
few cents, or the $100.00 jackpot item(1). Kill as many mobs as you can 
in 30 days for just $15.00!(2)(3)

1) $100 jackpot item valuation is just an estimate, no gaurantee that 
any item will have any value is expressed or implied. 

2) Odds of winning valuable tokens(1) will not be disclosed, and are 
subject to change without notice. Additionally we reserve the right to 
render tokens untradable or otherwise modify them without notice.

3)  A 15% commission is deducted when you (attempt) to cash in your 
tokens after gambling... er playing.
