You're missing the most important part of the set: it looks good.

This is something they finally figured out; there are quite a few people
out there who want their characters to look good.

I remember clerics wearing full sets of sol ro quest armor.  Drove me
nuts, there were only a couple pieces worth wearing in the whole set as
far as I could see, what with the stats all over the board and all (the
bracers were decent)

But they just looked at my crazy patchwork cleric getup, every piece a
different color or style, and they'd be wondering what kind of lameass
player would look that bad just for a few more wisdom points or something.

At least the newbie armors tend to have coherent sets of stats, so if you
have a full set you actually end up with a decent, if still small, boost
to stuff thats of interest to you.  But more importantly, they look like
something unlike cloth or raw silk or something like that.
