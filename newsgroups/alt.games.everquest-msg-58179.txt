I have a pretty good idea of how you feel :) I'm pretty much leveling
as an afterthought now, but I still hate pharming greens and hate
soloing. As my guild grew older, they started forming hunting groups,
but I grew apart from them - they'd form up and go somewhere an hour
or two before I'd even logged in, there was always at least another
druid present from the 'usual group', making me feel superfluous
(especially if it was guild leader, she seemed to always feel the need
to tell me what to do as if she thought I didn't know what I was doing
- I'm going to have to work out my resulting grudge against her one of
these days), and if I asked to come, they were usually full anyway. I
asked several days ahead for help for an epic step and a couple said
they would come with me; on the day I did it, only one of them
actually came. I'd become the odd druid out and basically stayed
guilded because I'd miss having guildchat.

Roughly a week ago, a guildie in a similar situation told me he was
about to go to another guild with that character. It was a newly
formed guild with a *lot* of good highlevel people, so I asked if they
had a problem with druids. They didn't, so I talked with one of the
officers, sent an application after logging, and was accepted as a
temp the next day.

This guild wants to be a 'family guild that happens to be able to do
big stuff', and it's looking good so far. It doesn't have the clicks
my old guild has, and in the past week I've been with them on small
outings to the Hole, to LGuk, been on my first trip to Fear, and will
be able to do even more with them once I get to change my playing
hours. Being in a guild I didn't really feel part of anymore was
really disheartening, so this change has really improved the game for
my main character (I suspect my alts are going to start leveling more
slowly again now ;) )

(Drywit, does this explain? You asked about the change while I was
trying hard not to get lost in LGuk, and had logged by the time I was
able to write sentences :) )
