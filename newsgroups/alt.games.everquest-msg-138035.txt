A druid friend of mine accidentally deleted a wurmy a friend had loaned 
her, and she's trying to get it back.  I, being an agnostic DE rogue, am 
wondering if I can get one of the dragon scales to give to her by doing 
the part involving Tektite.  From what I've read, I wouldn't be KoS to 
him, and although the Tektite is no drop, I could hand in the gem and 
the Tektite to the guy in Sol Ro and get the dragon scale, which I 
*think* is no drop.

Also, I've seen dragon scales on sale in the Bazaar for 50pp.  I have 
enough money to cover her if these are the scales she needs, and 100pp 
would be easier than finding what are apparently 2 fairly rare spawns in 
their 50s (and she's only in her 40s), but apparently the only way to 
find out if it's the right thing is to cast identify, which I believe 
you can only do by having the item, right?  Anybody know of a way to get 
a trader to let your identifier hold it without risking giving them the 
50pp and them saying "oh wrong one, too bad"?  Also, which classes *get* 
identify?

Ryou
