Ok, if that's true then I withdraw the suggestion.  Please note that I
am going by others' posts as to the effect of CH in high end encounters
here.  The toughest mobs I've had combat experience against are ratman
guard and guardian wurm, so most of my knowledge about the high end game
comes from this group.  Your comment above is actually one of the more
illuminating I've read on this particular subject.

Heh, not my class, I do have a Druid, but he's all of L15 and I almost
never play him.
