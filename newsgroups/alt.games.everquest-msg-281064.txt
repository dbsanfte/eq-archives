Thinking about this, probably I wouldn't have had to fight my way back
in, I'd just have to get someone to summon my corpse.  I'm sure if I
asked in guild the next day I could have gotten someone to come.  But
I just hate getting people to stop what they are doing and help me
out.  And I also hate the feeling of "you can't play until you get
your corpse back, so you just get to hang out online".  That always
feels so unproductive... I might as well be watching the grass grow.

Anyway, back to WoW vs. EQ1 vs EQ2, I just like the way WoW does it.
The cash penalty is enough that you really don't want to rez at the
graveyard unless you have to... but if you need that option, it's
there and you move on.  I get stressed enough in RL w/o having to
stress in my online life as well.
