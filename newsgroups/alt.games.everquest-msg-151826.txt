Max damage is affected by your damage table (always better for
melees than casters, at high level better for some melees than
others), either your ATK "stat" itself or the various things that
go into computing it (i.e. Offense skill, Weapon skill, STR, and
ATK buffs/debuffs) (no way to tell if they're using ATK directly
or if it's just eye-candy), your level (probably, never seen any
direct proof), and your Damage Bonus for the weapon.  Melees, with
the possible exception of Bards (dunno, have not played one) get
a Damage Bonus added to all hits with their Primary Hand, this
bonus is determined by level (does not apply under L28) and the
type of the weapon (1H or 2H), and 2H weapon Damage Bonuses scale
with the weapon's delay.  Note that, because the Damage Bonus is
determined by level and class, it is silliness to include it in
an /auc as so many of the clueless still do.

Oh, damage tables improve at L10, L20, and L51 for sure.  I've also
seen unverified claims of changes at L30 and L40.
