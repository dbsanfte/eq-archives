Before getting cable I had Surf Unlimited, with Telewest/Blueyonder.
�9.99/mth
Sometimes left it on for more than 10 hours at a time with no cut off. Maybe
not
24/7 but long enough. Now on blueyonder broadband it is always on, (unless
the
network goes down) which is often a necessity in heavily populated zones, LD
would be
much worse with dial-up. Cost �33/mth, �25 with cable TV service.
