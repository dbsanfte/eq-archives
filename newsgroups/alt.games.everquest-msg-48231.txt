Ok, I'm not big on any of these new models, but ewww that Dark Elf female is
not the sexy one I play now.  Yikes.  The human female needs some work, she
still has "man hands" but is probably getting tweaked before release.
Atleast lets cross our fingers.  And I think that Ogres got the shaft on
this deal.  I love those big cuddly guys but these ones are not quite what I
had hoped for.   Ok my 2cp worth is done, but hey, it can only get better
right?
