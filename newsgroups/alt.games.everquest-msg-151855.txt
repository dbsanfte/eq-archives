I've been soloing in Paludal Caverns with my Enchanter since about level 12.
That is not a zone where I would recommend a mez, nuke strategy.  The pet is
quite up to the task of taking on the mobs, even the low level pets.  The xp
is absolutely amazing in PC, it far outstrips any outdoor zone xp, where mez
and nuke might be more useful.  I keep a few stacks of cat's eye agate for
runing, and find that I have no trouble at all soloing with my pet.  I sit
and med for the most part, tossing in one or two nukes.  Keep the pet
hasted, the mobs slowed, adds mezzed, and xp just flies by.  Worst case, you
die, kill a mob or two, and get the xp back.  I have tried charming a mob
for my pet, but find that I can go through more mobs, more reliably using a
pet that won't turn on me at just the wrong moment.  I do make sure to hop
into the fight to get skill increases on my defensive skills, I know I will
badly need them later on.
