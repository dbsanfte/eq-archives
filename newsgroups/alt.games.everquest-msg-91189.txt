Hmmm...  And how much do you pay for Roadside assistance btw?  I do believe
in the case of roadside assistance, you pay somewhere around $40 to $70 or
so per incidence.  Tech Support for MS products, one of the world's most
buggiest OSes, baring from their knowledge base database, is about $80+
dollar per incident, or spending close to $300 a year for their TechNet
subscription...  Symantec's own tech support is $40 dollars after x number
of days of purchase of a program per incident.

Tech Support is paid through the $10 a month per player playing...  A large
chunk of that goes into operational expenses, since a T1 x N, in an area
like San Diego is somewhere around $800 to $1300 a month per T1...  Then
there is the nice electrical bill for the 42-43 servers that are basically
something like 14 to 20 machines per server running 24x7, the network
switches/hubs and routers, not to mention UPSes that may actually HAVE to
keep these things up, plus the login server(s), the chat server, the
Password authentication server, the machines that the GMs and Techs use,
the machines and their test server for development, the office machines,
and lights of the office.  That is one hefty bill there.  Then there is the
personel costs, where people actually work to be paid, so that is 42 to 43
GMs for the servers, then the GMs who float to help out on things when
another GM is swamped, the poor GM who sits in the chat room, who has to
listen to the bitching and griping of players and can't really say how he
feels about some of the crap he gets.  Hell, I haven't even gotten to the
people who who actually RUN the company, the costs of production and
marketing as well as advertising.

I use to WORK for Activision, only for 3 days.  They have 9 to 5 tech
support, and I came in on the night shift to do alpha testing for them.
They don't HAVE a 24x7 tech support for their products and they don't do a
subscription service.  They have to keep themselves alive with new
products, where as Verant is supporting the product they have with add-ons.

At this point, the expectation of having 24x7 tech support at $10 a month
is ridiculous.  Economically, it is not possible, and hence the reason why
Legends is $40/month, to pay for the GMs who will be staffing it, real GMs,
not volunteer players like Guides who don't get paid to help players within
reason.

So, if Empty is clueless, and I just listed off reasons why your
expectations are unfounded and uninformed...  What does that make you?
