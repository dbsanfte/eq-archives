in regards to this statement alone, there really isnt a way to satisfy the
casual player, remember that celebration thing that a few months ago and all
the skeletons and certain zones that were targetted for mid level chars?

the true casual player can never enjoy anything new because the high levels
will be there raping the lands for their alts.
