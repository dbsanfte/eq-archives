URL stands for unique ressource relocator (spelling?). So there is
absolutely no reason that an url describing a .exe file would be
invalid. So tinyurl should accept such an url.
They might block it though but as exe files aren't always viruses that
would be a rather poor decision. So unless they mention such behavior in
their faq urls dexribing exe files are valid and should be accepted by
tinyurl.
