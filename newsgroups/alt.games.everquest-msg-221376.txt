Newest server is Stromm, which was started in May I believe.  They have not
allowed transfers of existing characters to it (and my guess is that they
never will).  I haven't logged onto that server since the week or two after
it was first started, but if you want to start over from scratch and want
company as you level up, I'd guess Stromm is the best place to be.
