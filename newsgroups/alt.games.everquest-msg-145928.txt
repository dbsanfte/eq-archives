I actually used a <shocker> in real life but a bet was involved so it
doesn't really count. A mate of mine was checking out this Thai girl with
unnaturally large hooters but was otherwise very good looking.

We were debating whether or not she was a working girl or not and after a
few moments a wager arose. I bet $20 she was a working girl and he, most
proberly out of wishful thinking took up the opposing side. But how were we
to find out?

No problemo!

I went up to the bar and asked for a pen and what the girl in question was
drinking*, grabbed a coaster and wrote merely the following two symbols on
it:

    $ ?

I then gave her the Strawberry Monstrosity#, smiled brightly and showed her
the coaster...

*SLAPPPP*

Dang. There went my $20 dollars but at least she did mellow considerably.
Later on during the night after the 3rd Strawberry Monstrosity she chatted
for a while and we are still friends these days.
.

Cheers.


*Tipping is not part of Australian culture as service workers get decent
wages. You only really tip as a compliment if you have recieved good service
in a resturaunt, but not much else.

This bar was in the Hilton Hotel in Brissy and I had gotten into the habit
of tipping a particular bar tending girl up to a hundred bucks over a night
so she would turn herself inside out if I requested it.

It came in very handy finding out what the Thai's and Filipinos drank, who
was married, who wasn't and who didn't particulary mind either way. It was a
useful arrangement. Unfortunately these days the Thai's and Filipino's have
moved out of that bar as they went rap music : (

#Not the actual name of the drink but an apt description. Crushed ice,
umbrellas and all sorts of crud in it.
