I have 3 Greater Lightstones and about 11 Lightstones, heading to see
Mrysila in NK for the Concordance of Research.  One GL will get me a
Concordance of Research, and the Lightstones get me one of two (random)
research books. I dont really need those because of on-line information.

I understand you can turn in GL, then sell book to other gypsy for 8 pp - so
I'll do that with 2 of my GLs, and use the 3rd to get a Concordance I will
keep.

Do you get xp from Mrysial for turning in Lightstones even if I don't really
want /need the books?

I paid 1 pp each for the lightstones, what is the best way to make value
(pp, xp) out of these rocks?
