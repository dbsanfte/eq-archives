Start in Kelethin so you can work up a decent 'tude oover all the
snubs from those irritating woodies.  ;)

Bah!  I play Half Elf Paladins and Warriors, that's painful enough.
My Druids have all been Humans *bonk* and the only *bonk* trouble with
*stumble* Human Druids *thud* is that damned *bump* tunnel *bonk* out
of Surefall *%^$@#^@* which is easily *crash* dealt with by taking a
whack at Ran Walker the fifth time you see him on your way out.  The
only problem then is that you can't go home until you get a Fire Beetle
Eye, but you need one of them anyway.
