The reason we can make long lines are for us to USE them. Just type your 
auction once, and then use Shift and arrow up to repeat it when needed. 
1 long line are a LOT less bothersome than 5 short ones. And in the 
short lines, you cant get the stats on most items anyway due to lenght, 
better to use long lines, i can du all my auctions on 7 items in 2 
lines, including price and stats.

Oh, and by the way, when people use Shift and pageup to repeat lines, 
you can use arrow left and right to edit the line. I still dont get why 
people who know how to repeat an auction write "Legs sold" or something 
like that at the end of an auction, instead of just editing the line.
