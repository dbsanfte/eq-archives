My issue with it, and the reason I shut ZA down before playing EQ, is that I
can't get to the window that asks me to approve it.  Approving the patcher
is no problem, but when EQ starts up, the window from ZA pops up, is hidden
by EQ, and I cannot access it at all half the time, and even when I can
access it, I have to shut down EQ, and restart after approving it.  So I
decided it wasn't worth the trouble, and just shut it down now.
