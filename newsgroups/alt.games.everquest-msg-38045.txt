And a mid-level who is forced to auction for gator legs because the AC
is camped 24/7 doesn't like that game either.  Here's an item he could
easily get, in a group probably, except for the fact that the thing is
always going to be camped by a level 55 necro.

Nobody is trying to stop you from getting loot from mobs appropriate
to your level.  What they're trying to stop is you going somewhere
*you have no business going* to get loot.

This is the part the anti-TLC crowd keeps ignoring.  You aren't
SUPPOSED to be in these places.  They weren't designed for you, they
were designed for lower level characters.

In EQ, as with most of these games, one is supposed to fight a
*challenging* monster to get nice reward.  When a 55 camps the AC,
there is no challenge whatsoever.  This is a critical concept, which
again the anti-TLC crowd just ignores because it isn't convenient.

Other games have restrictions on this sort of thing; I mentioned
Asheron's Call earlier in the thread.  Prior to TLC, EQ has had no
such restrictions.  I think VI was hoping things would naturally work
out and they wouldn't have to use artificial means.  But clearly now
they've given up on that idea and resigned themselves to using an
artificial method to achieve the desired result, as other games have.

The anti-TLC crowd keeps acting like this is unprecedented, but it
isn't at all.  This is what I was trying to say before:  No, sorry,
you DON'T have the right to go anywhere you like and do anything you
want.  No one does in an orderly society, else might-makes-right would
be the order of the day, as it is now in EQ.

The game *naturally* prevents the mid-level from going to get himself
a lammy -- he wouldn't last two seconds in the place you go to get it.
There are no such natural means for keeping the high level out of
areas inappropriate for him, so over the course of time game designers
have tried various methods of preventing this, with varying degrees of
success.

You keep saying it's unfair and hypocritical for high levels to be
"singled out" like this.  But how many lowbies do you see in Seb?  And
no, it isn't a different thing, it's precisely the point.  As a
general rule, you want people to stick to the areas designed for them,
so they aren't an annoyance to the people the area IS designed for.

Within reason.
