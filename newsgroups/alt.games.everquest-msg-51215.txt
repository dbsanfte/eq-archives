*ROFL* Now wouldn't it be nice if this was true... *sarcastic chuckle*
like that'll ever happen. The people at Verant aren't the most
intelligent people in the world, but they aren't the stupidest either.
Do you know how many high lvls would be complaining if this ever got
passed?

As for my paladin, ever since they let everyone else get epic weapons,
I've been wondering why I even play one, seeing as they only have v.
undead spells and aren't as powerful as warriors. The only thing I've
really got going for me now is Lay Hands, and if everyone gets that
too, I'm starting a char. that gets machoism at lvl 1. Who ever wrote
that was outta their minds
