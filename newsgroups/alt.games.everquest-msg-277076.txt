Hey y'all,

I hear conflicting opinions about whether or not these items poof at the end 
of the anniversary celebration.

Opinions?

Facts?

TIA,

Mike W.

The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason 
for existing.
One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of 
eternity, of life,
of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to 
comprehend a little
of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity.

- Albert Einstein
