The main difference is that the police wouldn't BEGIN the whole
process with carpet bombing your house because they're kinda sure the
murder is there.[1]

Once we find out who did it, I'm all for reducing those persons to
their component molecules, and if those people harboring them don't
give them up, woe betide them too.  This doesn't mean carpet bombing a
whole country.  The term 'surgical strike' was invented for a reason.

[1]Yes, I know.  Waco.  Ruby Ridge.  Saw the movie.  Read the book.
FWIW, the vast majority of police actions in the US don't start or end
that way.  But that's a whole 'nother kettle of fish.
