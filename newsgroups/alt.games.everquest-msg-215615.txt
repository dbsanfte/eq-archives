Well... Given a sufficiently high-end group, and a post-58 Druid, I have 
found that Druids can certainly keep up with heals, if they don't waste 
mana nuking (my best nuke so far does as much damage as a few seconds of 
melee, if unresisted. BFD).

On the other hand, it's always taken a few hours for me to get an invite 
to a group. In that respect, the situation has not improved from PoP. 
The upside is, while I'm waiting for the invite, I can still solo... And 
at least some people are beginning to use the LFG tool now.
