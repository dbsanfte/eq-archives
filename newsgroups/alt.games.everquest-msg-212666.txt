Warriors are all about the gear.  You don't say what you have (or even
what the price range for the Acrylia BP is on your server), so it's
tough to say what is the best easy improvement for you.

The Acrylia BP is good at 30 AC.  Barbed Ringmail has more HP with the
same AC. I don't know price differences; I don't know whether you'd
get more bang for you buck upgrading another piece of armor.  Doing
the quest for crafted armor is nice experience even in the 30's and
nets usable armor.  Validus Custodus Plate Breastplate is 20 AC, +10
Str, -5 Agi, +15 HP, +8.00 Wt, and often very cheap on my server.
