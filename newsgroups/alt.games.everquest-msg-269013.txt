Supposedly (according to other players and to devs) the only item whose
condition matters is the first item listed in construction, AKA the "primary
ingredient".  For elm boxes this is the piece of planed elm lumber.

There's one problem.  You're wasting power with those double hits.  All you
need to do is hit once, the correct button, for each problem that arises.

Now, that fixes part of it.  The second part is that you're able to change
how the bars move by pressing buttons when they're not required.  But to do
that you need to check what they do.  Some improve progress by decreasing
durability.  Some do the converse.  Some improve progress by gobbling power.
Read the descriptions of what the buttons do and use that to decid which
one(s) you're going to mash over and above the responses for the problems
that show up.

Keep in mind, though, that you're low level.  Your mashing is prone to
error, low success rate, and relatively high power use.  This is endemic to
being low level.

Feltching, err, Fletching, is used in making arrows.  Unless you're making
flying boxes, you won't be using Fletching.

All of the skills, Fletching, Woodworking, Light Armouring, et cetera, can
be checked under EQ2 / Skills.  It'll show you the current value and the
max.  These are skills like Offence / Defence / 2HS / et cetera in EQ1 (if
you've played it).  They increase randomly while you're performing the
actions which they regulate.  There's no way to tell if / when they'll
increase.  There's a suspicion that button-mashing will make it happen more
often, but no hard proof that I know of as yet.
