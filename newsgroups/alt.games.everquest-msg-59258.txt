Well, I would do it just to piss you off jaZZ, but I really don't
think that always bottom posting is correct.  For some responses
bottom posting is best, for responses to long posts interspersed
posting works better for me, and for quick answers to questions with
over  a full page of quoted text, I prefer top posting.  
I think one of the reasons I like it this way is that I started
reading usenet AFTER threading newsreaders were fairly common.  In
many instances, especially in the newsgroups that I frequent (/wave
a.d.b.) conversations tend to drift and such, but really come down to
just one or two added lines after 3 pages of quoted text.  If the
response is posted at the top, I can immediately read it, and assume
by the way it's indented that it's a response to the previous post in
the thread.  I then just hit next, read the one or two new lines inthe
next post and continue on.  If everyone bottom posts I have to scroll
to the bottom of the message to read the relevant parts.  Of course
I've never used a windows newsreader that wasn't designed for offline
reading, so I don't assume I'm going to have to wait for several
seconds for the body to load, so I want to see that next post NOW!
