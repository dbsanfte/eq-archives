I'm *still* a pyro, though old age is tempering my basic nature with a
bit of wisdom. Finally.

I once built a model rocket, when I was at college. I fired it out in
the middle of this big empty field. The rocket went up about ten feet,
leveled off to the horizontal, and flew out of the big empty field and
into a little crowded volleyball game.

The jocks were not entirely amused.

I took the rest of the D engines, stuck short lengths of fuse into
them, lit them, and tossed them out of my high-rise dorm room at
night. Campus police are very very dense folks.

You can be the Prime Minister.
