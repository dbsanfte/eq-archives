Hi, with all this crashing stuff after the patch, and GM advice not working
(and all other things being ok afaik on my end) I figure the only thing left
to do is remove and reinstall EQ (I don't see why that would work, but hey
it's windows, things like that seem to fix it sometimes). But before I do
that I need to know if doing that will wipe my chars? because obviously I
dont want to do that....
Thx
