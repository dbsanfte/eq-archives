I've now completed the Bones of Draz Nurak (Divine Might) quest, which is what this whole
Phinny thing was about in the first place ;->

Last night, my 65 Shammy friend and I visited Phinny. The whole of our activities in Kedge
Keep took about 20 minutes.

Basically, we cross-buffed, invised, and navigated the Keep to Phinny's ledge. We caught
aggro once, about halfway to the ledge, when my invis dropped just after we went through a
sliding rock wall/door. The bullhead shark who caught me, and one seahorse who showed up
to heal him, were dispatched uneventfully.

Upon the ledge, we determined that Phinny was not up, but his guardian seahorses were
hanging around. My friend discovered that only 1 of them saw invis, and managed to single
pull him. In fact, my friend effectively soloed the seahorse. I got in about 1K of dmg
over the course of the 3-minute battle. My buddy kept asking for stuns to keep the MOB
from casting CH, every time I cast a stun spell, it would be resisted, and I'd draw
aggro...and whirl...and whirl...and whirl. In retrospect, I think my friend was playing
with me ;->

Retrieving the dusty finger bones was cake. So was the swim-out (I didn't have any gate
potions with me), except that I got turned around right at the ZI, for just a moment.  Not
a good idea to get lost in Kedge Keep ;->

The final slaying in West Commonlands was easy. I could've handled the Revenant myself @
50, but my friend unleashed his "DPS beast," which turned out to be 3 huge wolf pets.
NICE.

After the quest was completed, I cleared EC of all the corrupt WFP Guards, including
Slate. Wearing my friend's buffs, my DEX was at 255, and my new DM innate was procing like
mad!! ;->
