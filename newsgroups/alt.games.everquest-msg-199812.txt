LOL...I like to give it away free too....I turn off trading so people
wont open a trade window by clickin on me. I sit and hand it out like
John Wayne Gacy tossing candy out his car window to a bunch of
schoolkids. You should see the shit tells i get from chanters who are
selling. Im not doing it to screw them....im doing it because i
can......and because its funny to see the tide of halfling druids come
runnin round the corner in search of FREE C!

I guess im just like the christian god...alternatly mean and nice.
