I'm wagering that changes in PoP for DKP guilds - parchments,
which you turn in for 61+ spells, are useable for gaining any
spell/song - only monks/warriors/rogues have no use for them.

OTOH - Guilds like FoH apparently assign them - and their 
magician who posts at the tower is behind many other caster
classes in receiving them.
