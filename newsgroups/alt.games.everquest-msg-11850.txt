True. Soloing is more consistent at least. Less variables to worry about.
Like other people going linkdead, people going AFK, runs to town, trying
to get 6 people to agree on a hunting spot, people playing different lengths

playing more and more with a regular group lately and we churn through mobs
now like a well oiled machine.
