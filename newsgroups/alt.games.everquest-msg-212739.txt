There is a formula for this (ask at EQTraders) but it's not a nerf - it's
*always* worked this way.
A (very) rough estimate is that for trivials below a certain point (70? 80?)
you have to be 50 or so points above that trivial to reach the 5% failure
rate (and 200 points above that trivial for no failures at all).
For higher base trivials (um...140+? 150+? Something like that, anyway)
you'll reach the 5% failure rate as soon as you reach trivial. For points
between, it scales.

And if you're doing lacquered gems, you might as well take your JC up to 200
(which can be done with enchanted gold) - JC is the easiest and one of the
cheapest tradeskills to skill up.
