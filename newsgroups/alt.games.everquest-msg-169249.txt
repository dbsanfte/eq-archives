When I was studying creative writing, we were taught that to imply an
accent, speech impediment, regional dialect, etc. that we should add an
_occasional_ misspelling, usually at the end of a phrase.

For example, Rhett Butler's dialog might be written as: "I don't think
that's exactly role playing, Suh." rather than "Ah don' thin thas zackly
role playin', Suh."

 A little goes a long way. You get the "flavor" without becoming
unintelligible. Works pretty good in EQ as well, I think.
