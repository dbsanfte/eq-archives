Your question, unclear as it is, is also one-sided.  It can easily be
reversed.  In a criminal proceeding, burden of proof can and does shift back
and forth.

For instance, the person scammed can easily prove that they were paid
$3,000.00, thus eliminating any question of whether the scammer had any
concern about the legitimacy of the business.  Records of the game company,
much more likely to be turned over without a fight in response to a criminal
FBI subpoena than in a civil proceeding, can show that "goods" changed
hands.

At that point, the burden is entirely shifted to the scammer to prove his
innocence, as guilt has been proved lacking some evidence to the contrary.

Will it happen that way?  No clue.  Could it?  Most definitely.
