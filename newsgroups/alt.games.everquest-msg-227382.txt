(Disclaimer: My guild is still so small we're not really using our loot
system, but we did put a lot of thought into it! )

I'm in favor of using a point system where a combination of /random and
CAWU (can and will use) will not suffice (ie, anything over one
group).  Officer-awarded loot has just burned out too many good officers
in other guilds I've been in. 

But that being said, I wouldn't want the tedious task of deciding what
loot is worth. So I liked the idea that one other person on this newsgroup
suggested, which is basically that you earn points for raid attendance (I
base it on the duration of the raid), and when you finally loot something,
your points go to O.  If only one person wants that item, they don't have
to spend their points, and if multiples want it, the one with more points
is the winner.  Very simple, and as fair as any other point system I've
seen.  Might not work for the raid guilds that are the size of a small
town, but all of our members agreed this was a simple solution that both
awarded effort and took the decisions out of the hands of people (who
always have an agenda, no matter how hard they want to mask it).

This should always come with the disclaimer that our guild's front page
has the quote:

"Pulling together is the aim of despotism and tyranny. Free men pull in
all kinds of directions." ~Terry Pratchett, The Truth
