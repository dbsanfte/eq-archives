Well, it's not entirely obvious.  Ie, at first glance the key seems to
be used to give you the one-time 30-day free play.  Sure, keep your
account name, password, and station name, if you want to keep that
character.  But people putting the box away for long periods of time
usually aren't concerned about keeping their characters; they're
probably thinking that if they ever have time to play the game again
they'll just start over from level 1.
