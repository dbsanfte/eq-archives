Been away for a bit, so if this has already been beaten to death just ignore
the thread.  There's been too much written on the subject to make Google
effective. ;-)

This was brought to my attention by a guildie who knows how I feel on the
subject.

From www.eqsleut.com:

==========
There are some reports that you can no longer use groups as a way of casting
level 50+ spells on lower levels. Word is that you have to be 43 to receive
these group buffs.

This is bad because it means no more high level damage shields, no more high
level AC and HP buffs (PotG, Pot9), no more KEI and no more HoV/Aego

Lets hope that this does not go through, because if it does it will be a
severe setback to those who use high levels to powerlevel.
==========

No, let's hope it does go through.  Finally.  At last.

Crash
