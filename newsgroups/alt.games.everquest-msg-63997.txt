...that its half nine at night here and still servers are down - but I did a
complete clean install of Linux Mandrake 8.1 and that passed the time
nicely.

I haven't even got a char high enough to go to Velious (bought the triple
pack) - but like many others I will help the new Luclin zones to crash by
creating a Vah Shir just to get a look see ;-)

Oh well - should get my copy on Saturday and the servers are bound to be
back by then.

Keep calm, people.
