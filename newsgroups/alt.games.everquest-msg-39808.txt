I'm not missing your point, I'm not *agreeing* with your point.

Really?  Then why, when I say, "So buy it off a mid-level," do I
always get this "Why should I have to?" stuff?

You don't just want the item.  You want the RIGHT to go camp the mob
who drops it, so you don't have to stoop to buying it off someone
lower level than you.

Maybe you *should* have that right; I'm not 100% convinced you
shouldn't.  I doubt VI is either.  But *that's* what we're discussing
-- whether the high-level should have the right to camp a lower level
zone for loot.  And whether banning the high level from such zones
would have a positive or negstive effect.

Sure.  Except high levels don't just camp loot for themselves.  They
camp for their level 20 or even level 10 alt.  They camp for a buddy
who's lower level.  They camp for their guild.  Or have you never gone
to Perma for a Runed Circlet for someone or to Runny for a BABS?

This would certainly help quite a bit.  But bear in mind what Verant
is trying to accomplish with TCC.  They're not out to make the game
less fun for the high level.  They're not out to persecute the farmer.
They're not even out to make the game easier for the lower levels.
What they're trying to do is bring more people to under-utilized
zones.  An obvious way to do that is by an appeal to the pocketbook.

Will it work?  I'm not convinced, but I'm certainly not all up in arms
about the experiment being tried.

I haven't seen anything posted which convinces me of this.
