I think there is a basic flaw in this line of thinking. Your whole
point can be boiled down to three short sentances:

-> "Beta" testing is supposed to mean the product is "feature
complete".
-> If that's not the case then you are essentially not testing parts
of the product that will evetually get released.
-> This is a bad thing.

Fair enough. However, you are making a huge assumption that the
external beta testers from the general public (open or closed) are
actually being relied upon as the main testing resource for all parts
of the product. It's entirely possible that that's not the case.

Having spent several years working for a large PC software company, as
well as plenty of years working on projects such as you (Banks,
Government agencies etc), I can say for sure that they are not the
same. The main difference between corporate App Development, and
commercial software is that by definition there is no "User
Acceptance" Phase. The general public does not have to "sign off" on
the program before it's released.

As such, when it comes to shrink wrapped mass market PC software,
anything that involves the public at large is a very controlled event.
Just administering such an event is a large undertaking. At Lotus we
used to create milestone builds for external testing with VERY
specific goals. Being "feature complete" wasn't necessarily one of
them. It was almost always to 1) Show off the product and generate
some buzz, and 2) Help with testing things that lots of hands on lots
of keyboards are uniquely good at. Sure, the general public do find
plenty bugs that the QA testers don't sometimes. But it wasn't all
that unusual for internal QA testers to be several builds ahead of
what the public is playing around with. Maybe even a dozen builds
ahead. It's also very common for the public beta build to "fork" at
some point from the main build. The consequence is that the public
never even "see" many of the fixes that come from their feedback.

Anyway, I can't say with respect to EQ2. I'm not in the test. I don't
really know. Time will tell though.
