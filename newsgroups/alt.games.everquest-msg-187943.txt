Just a few suggestions... Echo Caverns isnt bad xp at that level. Loot
isnt all that great however.

Jaggedpine is pretty good - killing poachers, for an outdoor zone, the
xp is nice and tons of pelts drop and the respawn is fast.

CoM isnt too bad - but kind of remote. You might get away camping the
entrance.

Some of the new zones offer nice xp, Dulak especially and the loot is
nice (altho recently nerfed - but still not bad). Havent hunted alot
in Gunthak, but the xp seems alot better in Dulak.

SolB is an old favorite, but I never spent alot of time there. Always
got trained so I said the heck with it.

Karnors is popular but if you are concerned about your VS faction,
dont hunt here (same goes with Kaesora and Howling Stones).

DL seems to bottom out of good xp at around 45 as you noticed. 

If you want to get away from everyone else, perhaps Mons Letalis might
be for you. Not sure how good the xp is tho.

RM is another popular spot at mid 40s - though mostly for the loot. If
you can stand constant bickering, KSing and other nonsense, it can be
lucrative. Its not always bad, but when it gets bad, it can get ugly.

Someone else mentioned Tenebrous Mnts (sp?). Xp for me seemed to slow
way down at 45 here, but i didnt hunt the vampires much (they are on
the nasty side).

Once you hit upper 40s (47 or so), PoP groups will be your best bet
(xp wise), starting with PoJ.
