*snicker* Surprised me, too.

It's actually from an old legend WHICH I CAN'T FIND RIGHT NOW because for 
some reason the webpage ain't letting me in. *g* Typical.  But here's the 
story itself (keeping in mind in the version on our webpage, it's a 
coyote or a crow or something of the sort):

XXVIII. THE EYE-JUGGLER[92]
(CHEYENNE: Kroeber, .Journal of American Folk-Lore, xiii, 168, No. 11)
There was a man that could send his eyes out of his head, on the limb of 
a tree, and call them back again, by saying "Eyes hang upon a branch." 
White-man saw him doing this, and came to him crying; he wanted to learn 
this too. The man taught him, but warned him not to do it more than four 
times in one day. White-man went off along the river. When he came to the 
highest tree he could see, he sent his eyes to the top. Then he called 
them back. He thought he could do this as often as he wished, 
disregarding the warning.

The fifth time his eyes remained fastened to the limb. All day he called, 
but the eyes began to swell and spoil, and flies gathered on them. White-
man grew tired and lay down, facing his eyes, still calling for them, 
though they never came; and he cried. At night he was half asleep, when a 
mouse ran over him. He closed his lids that the mice would not see he was 
blind, and lay still, in order to catch one.

At last one sat on his breast. He kept quiet to let it become used to 
him, and the mouse went on his face, trying to cut his hair for its nest. 
Then it licked his tears, but let its tail hang in his mouth. He closed 
it, and caught the mouse. He seized it tightly, and made it guide him, 
telling him of his misfortune. The mouse said it could see the eyes, and 
they had swelled to an enormous size. It offered to climb the tree and 
get them for him, but White-man would not let it go. It tried to wriggle 
free, but he held it fast. Then the mouse asked on what condition he 
would release it, and White-man said, only if it gave him one of its 
eyes.[94] So it gave him one, and he could see again, and let the mouse 
go. But the small eye was far back in his socket, and he could not see 
very well with it.

A buffalo was grazing near by, and as White-man stood near him crying, he 
looked on and wondered. White-man said: "Here is a buffalo, who has the 
power to help me in my trouble." So the Buffalo asked him what he wanted. 
White-man told him he had lost his eye and needed one. The buffalo took 
out one of his and put it in White-man's head. Now White-man could see 
far again. But the eye did not fit the socket; most of it was outside. 
The other was far inside. Thus he remained.
