Respect has many definitions. In this instance I am applying the
following:
"Willingness to show consideration or appreciation."
"To feel or show deferential regard for"

I have no respect for people who do not respect life (the man who
committed suicide), or those that try to blame others for their own
mistakes (the mother). They are no different to me than any other
faceless stranger.

Why waste compassion on those that do not deserve it? If I chop off my
hand intentionally, should you feel compassion or emathy for me over
my loss?

I save my compassion for those that are not victims of their own
stupidity.

I never set myself up as a role model. I merely expressed my opinion.

We are all free agents and responsible for our own actions. For any
action (or inaction) there are consequences.

When did I say that? I said that it was "bigger", than the problems of
1 woman and her suicidal son. EQ effects the lives of over 400K+
people, and indirectly thier friends and families. The same is true of
Football, Soccer, Baseball, Star Wars, NASCAR, etc, etc, etc. Yet no
one is suing the NFL when some kills himself on SuperBowl Sunday.

>Out of curiosity, when did you get elected

I am outraged that this woman is stupid enough to blame a game for her
sons ulitmate end. I am outraged that she did nothing to stop him,
despite all of the warning signs. I am outraged that there is a Lawyer
willing to take her suit, and I am outraged that major media outlets
waste time and bandwidth reporting it. I express this outrage on
behalf of myself. I only pointed out the size and existance of the
community to show how small and insignificant this woman and her son
are.

I never claimed to. What you are missing is the fact that none of us

Don't forget the mother of a mentally disturbed man who wants to sue
for money over his death. You saved some up for her as well.

No I get bent out of shape when people think empathy and compassion
should be showered on any poor fool that screws up in this life.

My priorities are straight. Are yours?
