Advanced melee technique here for the priest classes...WARNING this
is not for the faint hearted or lazy.  If you've played a bard, you can
handle this.

1) get a big slow weapon.  Damage ratio as high as you can get it, but
low speed... this is the opposite of what real melee classes look for,
which is delay as low as you can get it while keeping ratio high.

2) Make sure the mob is in no position to hit you.  You are -not- a
sponge, and this is going to make you a -huge- target.  You need
a very good taunter who can sponge, or you need a hate kite or
fear kite situation, or just use this at the end of fights when the mobs
are running naturally.

3) You need the actual attack button from your combat section, and
a button for sit/stand or Spell/stand.  You can't do this with an assist
hotkey or a more complex social that includes an attack command.
The Attack button greys out while your weapon is cyling thru the delay.

4) OK here we go.
a) Don't start until your situation is established as above: Snare and Fear
on, any DOTs you were planning to cast on, Melee's have had time to
Taunt... whatever.
b) approach the mob, preferably from behind unless you are using melee
taunt and have a rogue working that position.
c) mob targetted, hit the attack button and immediately sit down.
d) Stay on your butt until (1) your attack button comes back up and (2)
watching your mana bar you see it take a blip up
e) Stand up, close on the mob if necessary, and repeat from c)

5) Never forget your real job, be it heals, fears, snares, crowd control...
your melee output is likely half that of a real tank, and your real job is
far more important to the survival and success of the group than your
melee output even if it turns out to be higher than that of the real tanks.

Using this technique, you do not lose any mana due to meditation.  I originally

thought you would lose a fraction... but meditation is a pulse effect, you get
a chunk of mana on the pulse, size of chunk dependant on whether you are
sitting, standing, looking at book.  Since with this technique you are always
sitting on the pulse (looking at book if you are of that level range) you get
exactly as much med mana as your buddy fred who has been sitting on his
buttocks the entire time.  But you got melee skill ups, offense skill ups,
and shortened the lifespan of the mob, meaning less mana spent killing him,
and more mobs per hour.

As a cleric, I used this technique from 10 to 44 with a Runewood Great
Staff which cost me 200pp... it was not until 44 that the average paladin
my level started to do more melee damage than I did (thats melee damage
per minute, mind you, not the meaningless melee damage per blow
figure)

Why a slow weapon?  Well, you are going to be swinging at most once
per six seconds, which is the meditation pulse time.  Since there are almost
no weapons slower than this (60 delay) your real damage ratio is
weapon damage over 60 delay, not the damage ratio of the weapon.
A 30/40 weapon used this way would do less damage per minute than
a 31/60 one.  Further, Aggro in melee damage is not based on damage
done, but on number of swings.  If you aren't using this approach (say
you get to full mana and don't need it) then a 8/20 weapon (hitting say
for 8, 8, 8 in 6 seconds) will taunt three times as much as that 31/60
which might using the same innacurate average blow size do 31 damage
in 6 seconds.  Speed is not your friend.
