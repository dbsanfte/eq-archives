Look dude, its the 20th centry.  I quit making assumptions on who
was gay, and who was not once I found out about that HUGE WWF
wrestlers gay ring thing. I see fruity looking loons on the street
as well as construction workers and the whole WWF thing - I think
the days of pin-pointing a gay by look/movements are *long* gone.

20-30 years ago, yea, but now-a-days with the athletic, WWF, and construction
workers all coming out now days, thoes days are long gone.

So you want a special law to be able to blame someone for something
over and above the crime the've commited ?  He killed someone, but thats
not good enough, but because the guy was gay (even if he perp didn't
know it) you want more penality.
