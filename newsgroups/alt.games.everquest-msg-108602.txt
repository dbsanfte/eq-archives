}The best way to transfer items without two accounts or help from someone

}oven, etc.), put the items in you want to transfer, camp, log in the other
}character, and take them out.  Items will never decay in a tradeskill
}container and if someone happens to go wandering by they won't see a bag
}lying on the ground just asking to be picked up.

If using this method, make double-double sure that nothing you're trying 
to trade is no drop before you start.  You can put a no drop item in a 
tradeskill container, but the instant you close the container, it poofs.
