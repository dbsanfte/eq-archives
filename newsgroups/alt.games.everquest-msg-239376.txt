The guy in Crushbone responded with the four plat comment, because he
was thinking about the chipped bone rod you can buy to "locate
corpse."  So you should have gone in the zone and specified that you
were "Lesser SUMMONING" corpses. 15 plat would be a rather lot to do
that in Crushbone, unless no one else was ever in the zone and a level
12 person's corpse was trapped under Crush or something. Maybe you
should have just said "donation." 

The guy who offered 200 was likely high enough level that he'd need
the full corpse summoning, rather than lesser.
