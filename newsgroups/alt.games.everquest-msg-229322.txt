Read much?

A) This is a regular nightly group, which means I do plenty of other 
things, as do the other members of the group, at other times of day and 
even some evenings.

B) I'm playing EQ, as far as I know there isn't a local LAN/XBox version 
of EQ out there

C) Did I say we only play with the same 4 players?  No, I said we played 
with people we already knew to fill out the group, instead of random 
strangers and if we can't find known elements, we play 4 man... or even 
3 man.  Normally the group is 5 or 6 people strong, and thats selecting 
from a list of about 10 good players, Or a more extended list of good 
players that one or the other of the core group knows from playing 
elsewhere.  Potentially, then, any of the several hundred people in our 
level range on our server might be playing with us at any given point... 
except for those who've already been tried and found wanting either by 
our group or by any of us individually.

What we used to do is take the core plus known elements and then fill in 
with anyone we could find to make a solid 6... solid on paper that is. 
Several bad experiences in our late 40s and early 50s soured us on this 
approach, people who couldn't play their class or who couldn't follow 
orders or who couldn't keep up the driving pace we set... or even who 
just weren't fun to play with; annoying in our 30s, but fatal at higher 
levels of play.  I do a lot of pickup play during the day, have to sort 
thru a lot of rubble to find the gems.  The "regular nightly group" is a 
different animal, a well oiled machine, a joy to behold and to be a part of.

D) XBox and similar game only machines are a plague on our lands, and I 
will not have one in my house.

Naturally, I appreciate a well oiled machine
