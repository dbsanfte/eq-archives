I think it is simply network congestion. 400K subscribers all rushing
to check out the new expansion. Even if you don't purchase SoL you
still have to DL the new patcher as well as all of the support files
now needed by all players.

Add the "daily" fixes that are going in and you have a recipe for
disaster with regards to DL'ing the new files.

Just hang in there. I am sure it will get better.

Cheers
