Well, there are four reasons:

1) I'm an idiot

2) I'm an idiot

3) I've been up there many times, and he (or she) never seemed to be up.

4) The Wyverns in Cobalt Scar con only "threateningly" to me, so I 
figured that even if Wuoshi was up I would have time to at least fire off 
Gate. I *almost* got it off, between the Fear and the multiple AoEs... 
But not because Wuoshi didn't aggro the very second I touched down.

The amusing thing is that I just ported in to get to Kael, to see if I 
could leech faction off groups hunting there, or at least ask if it's 
bad manners to do so. Bah.
