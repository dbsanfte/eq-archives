hi all!
i decided to plunge back into the world mmorpg's, and chose EQ.  picked up
the one that includes kunark.  i'm slowly figuring stuff out, but was
wondering if there's supposed to be a movie first time you play the game?  i
purchsaed EQ previously after it first came out, and remember there being a
spiffy flick to get the juices going.  can anyone help?
