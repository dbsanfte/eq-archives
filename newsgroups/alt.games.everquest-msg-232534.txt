Lots of things can help or hinder, i suggest looking on the everquest live
site for help in their technical forums.  Also especially in the nexus i've
seen people that stack dead bodies on top of each other, graphics cards
"draw" each body and as you look past them it will severely tax any machine,
use /hidecorpse all in certain zones and see if that helps.
