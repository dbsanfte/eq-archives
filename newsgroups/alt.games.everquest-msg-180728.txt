Well i think i can fill you in there. It's not about the amount ppl are
asking, it's about the amount ppl can afford. That means that there is too
much money on the server. In theory most items in bazaar should be cheaper
than when you find them on vendors. But if you can buy any time for 1k
bazaar and find it later ffor 350pp on a vendor than the economy is kind of
screwed up. It means money is easy, almost a non issue.

But it's something happening on all kinds of servers it happens in real life
as well. All i can recomment to him is buying eq2 asap and maybe apply for
beta testing. Being one of a few on a server working har dto get all the
skills up again. And literally doing everything yourself or with jsut a few.
It would be nice though getting involved with beta and working on things,
whenreg peeps are coming, already being in the bazaar if it exists and
selling lowclass goods for decent amounts of pp
