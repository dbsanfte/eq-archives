    Your ignorance of what goes on during raids, especially modern raids, is
quite astounding. Adds don't come at nice intervals and only attack plate
tanks. Plate tanks don't live forever, regardless of how much you heal them.
AE's can't always be resisted, whether you have 500 to all resists or not.
I'm a cleric, with over 9000 HPs with full raid buffs and leadership AA's,
and I'd kill for more HPs. That's not even getting into secondary foci like
+ATK, Accuracy, Flowing Thought, etc.

    Here, let me do the equivalent of what you did above when talking about
raiders:

    All soloists are casters. It doesn't matter how many HPs they have,
because the only ones that ever get hit are the morons that don't know what
they're doing. The game should never reward them with better gear, since
there's very few and they don't need it anyways - all they need is what they
buy off spell vendors and Bazaar spell vendors.

    Did you not read what he wrote? On my server, soloers are the ones
farming the crap out of Veksar/Droga/Nurga/Cazic Thule and getting mad cash
with which to buy items from areas they cannot access or solo. That's better
than their contemporaries which play group-only classes, who can't get in on
cash drops to nearly the same extent.

    So suggest some. I imagine your idea of "interesting" will include
rewards that would make King Midas gasp, but go ahead and suggest it.

> There is no reason raiders should get substantially better gear:

    Effort versus reward. Those nifty items you see linked to you take
hundreds of man-hours to obtain. You want an equivalent reward in a
substantially smaller time frame. Nuh-uh. I have no problem with things like
solo LDoN missions, or elemental-quality items on LDoN merchants. I think
that's good for the game - it gives both groupers and raiders things to aim
for. But if it takes a raid 50 people and one hour to get elemental quality
item X, it damned well better take Joe Solo at least 50 hours to get an item
of equivalent quality (and likely longer if you consider respawn time as a
limiting factor in items entering the world).

    Amazingly, raiders both solo and group. So, raiders are people who solo,
and group, and raid. Sounds like they really are more adept, as they need to
be good at more things than you do!

    How do they get in a good guild if this is all they can do? They won't
have good gear, they won't have good AA's, nobody who groups with them
during the recruitment period will have anything good to say about them -
how do they get into good guilds if this is all they're capable of doing?

    As opposed to rewarding the social retards that cannot forge bonds with
other players in what has always been a game about grouping and bonds?
There's other games which don't have raiding as an endgame - go look into
those.
