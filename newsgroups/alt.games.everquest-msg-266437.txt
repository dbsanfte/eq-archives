Only summoners (a mage class) get pets, with two subclasses:
necromancer (evil, undead pets) and conjurer (good, elemental pets).
At least those are the classes for which pets are a core feature -
it's possible that some other classes may get pets at higher levels,
but those will likely be comparable to the druid pet in Everquest,
i.e. mostly useless.
