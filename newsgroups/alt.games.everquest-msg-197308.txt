My chanter and group won the second time I tried it . Since then we run a
50% sucess rate and the losing 50% is when the 6th person we are trying to
flag does something stupid. The problem is that the difficulty level was set
to be non trivial to uber guilds and that makes it pretty damn hard on
everybody else.

cleric chanter shaman 3 melee works well
cleric chanter 4 caster works well

Not sure how I feel about changes . With lots of twinks it will certainly
make it easier to get them where I want them. However the sub 60`s lfg and
training in level 3 or higher zones and sub 50s in pov/pos/hoh are really
gonna suck.
