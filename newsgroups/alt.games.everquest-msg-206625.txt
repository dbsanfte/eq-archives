See..the thing is, he e-mailed Sony and told them that our account was
"shared" thus infringing the EULA. So I tried many times to get support
until they e-mailed me back in a very very rude tone depicting why they
can't help me and to stop asking for support. So yea. I'm screwed. By the
way..I have played Anarchy Online and like it very much but there was just
something missing. I think the familiarity with EQ makes all other games
feel weird. But Star Wars Galaxies is really looking good...except on ebay
they're already selling credits for real life money..that's nice. Well, keep
up the suggestions..

Thanks
