I am a shaman ogre.  This means I am hated by most NPC's.  I cannot
ebeter cities to do any quests that might raise faction.  Killing orcs
in EC does not seem to help.
My question to fellow ogres: what has been your strategy for playing
this character int he setting of the faction issue?  Do you ignore it
and just deal with the fact that you cant go to a great many places?
Or do you work on your faction.  If so how?
