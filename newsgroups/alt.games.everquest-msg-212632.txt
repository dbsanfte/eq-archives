    If someone else could come to a given conclusion, that would also be
"something that it is possible to know", is it not? And thus it would be
known to our theoretical being. Whether he knows the conclusion is right or
wrong would, of course, depend on if it is possible to know whether it's
right or wrong.

    Nor does he need to be. He just needs to be the least fallible being
around, which he is.

    In both cases, no other being would ever be able to discover that he was
wrong. He knows all that it is possible to know - if anyone could disprove a
theory that he held true, he would know the theory to be untrue.
Interestingly enough, this could lead the being to believe that there was a
god above him as long as he didn't know that he knew all that could be
known. ;-)

    Strictly precluded by "he can do all that it is possible to do".

    Ditto.

    That's entirely possible. See the "greater god" thing above - one of
them could be an atheist, one a deist, for example.
