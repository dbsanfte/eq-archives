Which server doesn't make a whole lot of difference, except for the 
'special rules' servers, like PvP (the Zeks), the RP Server (firiona Vie), 
Test, or the foreign servers (the Bayles).  I'd pick any of the others, 
pretty much on the basis of whether you like the name.  You can go check 
out the special rules ones later, after you have your bearings again, if 
they sound interesting.  Only other thing to think about really is server 
population, and that's really a matter of opinion.  I lean toward smaller 
server better, but others would surely disagree.
