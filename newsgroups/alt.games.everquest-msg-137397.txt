They also fixed the "Hey, I can crash anyone on any server!" bug. Some
people may have seen people using colors in chat. You could make a social
with a bit of html code which would change your font color. For example, the
social "/say <font color="#FF0000">Hey!</font>" would make you talk in red.
The problem was when people made a typo. If you did "/say <font clor>"
everyone in earshot would crash. This worked with every chat channel too,
someone accidentally crashed everyone in the mage's serverwide chat channel.
I was *really* tempted to shout something in the bazaar, but I'm not that
evil. :)

But the entire ability to use html in socials is gone, so I feel safe in
spreading this around. :)
