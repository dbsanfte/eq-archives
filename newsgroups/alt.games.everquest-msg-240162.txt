There's no component for a cleric or paladin to rez.  I don't take donations
for rezzes UNLESS it's in some Tunare forsaken zone in the middle of nowhere
and I have to spend time / plat to get there, (levitate, sow  and port to SB
for a rez in Dulak for example).  
I DO appreciate you having your corpse at the zoneline when I get there,
especially those zones easily accessible by a book.  And personally I am more
likely to give you that rez if you announce it as such:  ie, "could someone
please rez me in the Overthere I have already dragged my body up to the book"? 
  
Please don't ask me for a rez then make me stand around waiting because you
haven't bothered to locate and haul the corpse to the zoneline.
