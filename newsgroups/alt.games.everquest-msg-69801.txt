I'm thinking of upgrading my video card for SoL.....I currently have a
Geforce 2 MX 32 meg card and I had to drop from 1024x768 to 800x600 to
make Luclin playable. I really don't LIKE 800x600 and was wondering if
I picked up a Geforce 2 ti if it would allow me to go back up in
resolution. Newegg has a very nice Gainward Geforce 2 ti450 card with
4.5ns memory for $97.

I plan to upgrade my cpu/mobo/memory eventually but am waiting both
for my IRS refund and for the release of the 2nd generation of AMD
dual boards based on the 760mpx chipset in Q1 '02 (asus, abit, etc.).

The rest of my system:

Abit KA7-100 (orig KA7 blew a few caps)
Slot A Athlon 700 (running happily at 770)
512 meg Crucial PC133
Hercules Geforce 2 MX 32meg vid card
Hercules/Guillemot Fortissimo II soundcard
Generic UltraWide SCSI adapter
Netgear FA310TX NIC
Yamaha SCSI CD/R
Kenwood 72x CD-Rom
IBM 30gb HD
WinXP Pro

I know the Geforce 3 ti200's are coming down in price but at this
point in time they're still a bit outta my disposable cash range. I
would probably pick one up at the same time as the new cpu, etc. and
use the Geforce 2 ti in my 2nd machine. My dad would then get the MX.
:)  I just really want to get back to 1024x768 in EQ for the near
future and am hoping somebody has had experience going from an MX to a
Geforce 2 Pro, Ultra or ti series. 

thanks,

Scott H.
