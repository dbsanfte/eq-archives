It's not a bug.  The "random name" button just selects
a name by randomly assembling a limited list of "appropriate"
syllables for the given race.

It doesn't guarantee that that name isn't already in use,
however.  To check *that* you'll have to actually submit
the name by trying to create the character.

Often the name will already be in use, which is why you
got a rejection.  That's no bug, that's just bad luck.

And no, the game can't suggest only "not already in use"
names when you press the button, because it takes a while
to do the check -- it wouldn't make sense to do a dozen
database checks on a batch of names you're likely to
reject until you find one you like anyway.
