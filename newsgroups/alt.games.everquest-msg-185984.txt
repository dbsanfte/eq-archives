The "fast & easy travel" issue could have been solved MUCH better than
making every class a porting class.  As it stands, the current solution
has, indeed, destroyed some of the "wonder" of the game for true newbies.

Two ideas come immediately to mind:

1. Porting NPCs that charge for the service.  This will allow higher
   level players and twinks to travel easily, while still "forcing"
   true newbies to travel a bit (which is really an unforgettable and
   positive experience for them).

2. Have designated teleporting pads that you first much touch before
   you can use them as a launching point or a destination; i.e., you
   can only teleport to any given teleport pad if you've touched the
   pad once already (presumably, by traveling there "the hard way").

Or perhaps a combination of the two.
