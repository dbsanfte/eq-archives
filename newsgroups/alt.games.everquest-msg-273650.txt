I have to agree with you. Immersion is fun and challenging the first time,
after that it's just annoying and frustrating and a waste of time. The
problem is that game developers went too far in solving the problem. They
made it too easy to get somewhere instead of making it a little easier.
That's one of the reasons I like EQ2. It's easier to get places than early
EQ, but not as easy as POK made things.
