I think the answer is 'No', but I'm not positive. I had a character a
while back. I started back into EQ now and don't want to lose my
current character, but I would like to be able to salvage my old
character. Is there any way to do it? They are on the same server.

Not that I want to, but if I'd be willing to open my old account again
(for 2 active accounts), could I do that and get my old character
back?

Any help appreciated.

Daneel
