Interesting. I gave up DAoC and returned to EQ precisely because I wanted to
play a MMORPG and not a tactical warfare game incorporating PvP.

Thus far I haven't regretted my decision. The other factors were the
pathetic size and monotony of the realms in DAoC and the fact that within a
few levels you have seen all the spells and skills you're going to get, all
you get after that is higher level versions of the same things, whereas in
EQ you really look forward to getting new spells and skills as they are
substantially different - obviously some are upgrades of existing ones but
there are always new ones added in.

I can't see me going back to DAoC, but I do plan on giving AO another shot,
once I've finished Morrowind of course :).  Meanwhile, EQ keeps me going
quite happily. There's so much variety there, I started an iksar beastlord
last week and have spent the whole time on Kunark in zones I'd never really
seen before.
