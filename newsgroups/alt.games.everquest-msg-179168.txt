    If I turn up to a grind group with KEI and aego/virtue, and its got 3
druids without c3 in it, I'm unhappy. My buffs let the group pull more mobs
because healers spend less mana on me because I have more hp and AC and can
knock down mobs faster, and i just spent that money to benefit......
everyone else in the group? I don't think so! :)

    <finishes painting "flame me" on his butt>

    Actually, I'll trade a full group for one shammy partner with c3 any day
of the week :)
