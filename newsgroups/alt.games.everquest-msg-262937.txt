I believe the main differences are (1) the evac casts faster but
(2) the evac can (rarely) leave somebody behind.  I'm not sure
what the odds are of being left behind, maybe as high as 1% for
each character?

Though I've picked up the evac spells for completeness, I can't
really see using them in place of Lesser Succor, which is
basically an evac to the current zone's "succor point".  The
succor point is *usually* safe for everyone, though it can be
unnervingly close to mobs (including guards who might be KOS).

My wizard and druid both keep a Crucible of Escape on a hotkey
so I don't have to keep the spell memmed.  (My monk says succor,
shmuccor, and feigns death. :-)
