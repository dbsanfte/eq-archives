No. (and there is no "craftsman" skill) The skills related to your
profession are raised by using the crafting buffs related to that
skill. Using these buffs also ensures almost always getting pristine
items.

Making items that use those skills. It's going to be much harder than
raising your in-profession skills.

Bandolier. Are you using your crafting buffs? Because you shouldn't be
failing the combines completely...

No it won't. It will raise as you create tailored items.

I've been told societies giving quests for combines using the "wrong"
profession skills is a bug, though. I can't confirm or deny this. Just
what I've heard.

Yes, you're supposed to buy them. This is intentional to promote an
economy between players of various crafting professions. Alternately,
as the trade society you belong to levels up, they will generally
start offering the tempers and such, just at lower than pristine
quality.

Scholars have to buy their higher tier quills, craftsmen have to buy
higher tier resins, etc, etc. Supposedly, at present, you can scribe
the level 10 books from other professions for the recipes to make
these yourselves if you can get the books, but this is likely a bug
and I wouldn't rely on being able to keep those recipes. You also
won't be able to reliable make pristines like someone of the
appropriate profession would be able to.
