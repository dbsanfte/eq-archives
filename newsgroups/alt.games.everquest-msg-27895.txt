The Inane Dirk
dirk @ adjective-army.com

Burgy: "Well, the legendary Burghy, legend of legends, the greatest of
posters, a legend in his own time, the hero of the proletariat, beloved of
all, champion of champions, helper of the downtrodden, a hero among heroes,
the greatest of the great, great posters, whose name rings far and wide,
whose every legendary movement is revered in awe, master of all masters,
whose feats are legendary even when compared to legendary standards, the
most legendary of all posters, has come again to display my legendary
posting skill to all people, to everyone!  For only I can truly show these
people the finest spectacle, the greatest legendary post they will ever see!
For mine is to fight all who oppose me, even though they are a cowardly and
superstitious lot!  For I, Burghy, am the most legendary of legends!  No
doubt you are in awe of the legendary poster known as Burghy, as he
manipulates and works magic with his words!  So, with my legendary words, I
prove my legendariness to all present!  for mine is the true way, the
poster's way, the netter's way -- but yes, much more than this, I did it my
way..."
