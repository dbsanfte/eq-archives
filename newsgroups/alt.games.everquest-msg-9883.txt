And what "holy wars" would that be, Waco? Jonestown? Perhaps you are an illegitimate descendant of the
famously disappeared preacher, Aimee McPherson?

Since you have given me consent, I would gladly research your ancestry as far back as records exist. I
have contacts in the College of Heralds in the UK and several genealogical research facilities in the
United States, England, Wales, Scotland and France. History and genealogy are something of a specialty of
mine, and I was good enough to get my mother and sister membership invitations from the Daughters of the
Revolution.

Come on. You have challenged me to track your family tree down to (presumably) the Crusades. I accept the
challenge. Care to provide your pedigree so that I may gleefully dig up your ancestors?
