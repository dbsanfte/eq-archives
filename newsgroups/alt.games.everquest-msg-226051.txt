Some time ago a friend and I decided to reroll, start over as it were, 
on the FV server.  She wanted to try a shaman, and without a whole lot 
of thought, I decided to try a magician; my first character over level 4 
was a magician, abandoned at around 28 years ago.  I had the vague idea 
we'd do well together, two pet classes, plus a healer/slower/buffer and 
a high DPS nuker.

All in all I've been pleased with the combination, although I hadn't 
realized that I'd never want her best buff, the haste line, since I 
always have better.

Anyway, on a whim, last night I went and dumped a Ton of cash and all 
those useless training points into getting my research skill up, with an 
eye to trying to make a bit of cash researching the research only 
spells; they really don't make an appearance in the bazaar often, as I 
know from leveling up without the skill (I stopped researching after 
level 29 and just kept my nose to the leveling grindstone) and seem to 
command decent enough prices, hundreds of pp each, from components that 
typically sell for under 10pp.

I'd heard of advanced research as an alternate way to get higer level 
spells, not only for the research classes, but for priest classes as 
well.  I had the idea that any research class could do the research 
combines for any of the classes that don't have research skill.

Turns out I'm wrong about that, enchanters can't do it for anyone, while 
necromancers do research for clerics, wizards for druids... the kicker 
is that Magicians do the research for Shamans!

Just by chance I picked the perfect companion for this purpose.

Now what I don't see is where these advanced components drop, I've 
-heard- that LOY is the only place to find them,, if thats true then it 
seems it would make sense to start doing most of my exp hunting there. 
I can also go dumpster diving on the vendors at the lighthouse and in 
POK, and look for deals in the bazaar.

I'm interested in people's opinions about the whole endeavor though, did 
I just throw away 1500pp at my trainer, or is this skill worth pursuing? 
   Is it one of those things where the components are so rare and/or 
expensive that I'd be insane to try any combines with less than the 
skill cap, not for my level, but for my class?  Is there a geerlok for 
research, or something similar, that I should be getting to raise the 
odds still further?
