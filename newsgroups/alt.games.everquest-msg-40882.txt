Greetings,

I asked myself this question several times and I still have no answer. My
necromancer is now level 27  and I've been mostly fighting in SK (heh , can
you tell I am playing also a druid ? :) ). I like groups and I tried several
times but with very little success. I grouped maybe 2 or 3 times since level
20. True, there is no need to group from 20-24 when playing a necro in SK,
the hermit is just awesome. Level 20 everytime ? 2 minute spawn ? Virtually
no adds ? Try to beat that :) When I arrived first time at the hermit hut
there was a level 21 Bard camping it. So I watched for a while, I never saw
the hermit until then. So the hermit pops, buffs himself. Bard pulls him out
and starts fighting. I will not comment on the fact that the hermit is a
druid and there should be in way in hell this class could hit for 50 dmg
with bare hands at level 20. Anyway the Bard survived the fight with 10hp
left. Then he left, I took camp and after first kill I was full health, half
mana, pet almost full health :-) Me being level 20 at the time.

Anyways, during all these levels I had some partners. I grouped with a rogue
and we rocked. I was slowing, fear then rogue and pet would waste the mob.
My heal was also ok and I kept the rogue full health almost all the time.
Great group I would say. Then I grouped with a druid guildie at spires. We
did great job only 2 of us. SoW is a life saver, druid was little but higher
than me so snare had a better chance to stick. Then gnoll is pretty much
dead. We get an add ? I would mez it or at least fear it. For crying out
loud, nobody knew that necromancers could mez! Jeesh people, try to read a
little about the other classes.

I also grouped with another necromancer. Heh, who needs tanks ? Who needs
clerics ? We rocked.

I believe that we can bring a lot into a group though nobody seems to see
this. We have powerful DoTs, we can heal to some extent, we have a bad ass
pet if you keep in mind it is not a tank, we can nuke decently, we can mez
decently, if mob is not too high level we have almost unresistable lifetaps.
True, we can solo, we are the masters at that. But I like to group
sometimes, meet new people, feel safer.

Is this also your experience when playing your necromancer ? Is this how it
is going to be at higher levels ? What is your opinion ?
