Well, I know next char I start until I am 10, I am going to go on
Kamikaze missions on reds, and see if I can actually kill one. Places
where reds are often low on health and available for killing, like
zone lines make a lot of sense now.
DAOC forced the same tactic, run at the red and maybe it's overconned
and you level faster.

Looting higher level kills that the higher level guys don't care about
is even more feasable. Hanging around at the IG camp in parmafrost
just got a lot easier!
