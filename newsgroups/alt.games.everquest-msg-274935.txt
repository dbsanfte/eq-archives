Numbers look about the same from my viewpoint.  About 1/3 gone from the
established server population.  My server has lost 1/2 of its "top" guilds,
but at the same time I'd definitely not want to see a server merge with
another serve with a similar guild situation.  Right now, you have to work
to actually get into any head-to-head confrontation between guilds.

I think there's another hit (or possibly two) coming, though.  WoW raiding
is just getting started, and as far as I can tell is still a ways off for
EQ2, and either or both of those could entice a fairly large number away
from EQ once they are well established.  It will be a smaller hit
undoubtedly, but has a reasonable chance of being a significant one.  It
also won't have a day you can point to and say "that was when it happened."
