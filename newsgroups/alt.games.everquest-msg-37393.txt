You talk about role playing. Can you imagine an Ad&D GM letting a bunch
of level 18 characters play in a level 5 dungeon unmodified? Do you
think, if they did, anyone would be having any fun after the first 5
minutes?

/Shrug, if you want to play a game of boring mindless levelling followed
by boring mindless camping for items, then whine loud enough and I am
sure Verant will listen.

Personally, I want to play a game of exploration and raiding.

If anyone out there doesn't see why the current pro-framing code (it is
much much easier for a single level 50 to do some camps than for a full
group of level 40s, purely because of the reduced aggro distance that
the higher level has) has to do with raiding, I will explain.

Look at the similar level Kunark zones, Droga and City of Mist. Both are
set up as raid zones, both have good loot.

City of Mist raids are common, Droga raids are rarer than hens teeth. 
Droga is designed as a raid zone, like Chardok, Kael and the planes. But
noone raids there.

Why? 

Because Droga is soloable, whereas City of Mist is the lowest zone in
the game whose boss mobs can't be killed by a single shaman, necro or
mage.

So the reavers and Lords in CoM are on a fast spawn, and drop loot
commonly. Meanwhile, in Droga, the Chief has a placeholder and drops his
valuable stuff rarely. So there is no point gathering together 20 people
to raid him, when he is probably not even up.

Of course, you might think this could be fixed by making him more
common, and drop the idol every time. But then the law of economics
kicks in, something common and easy to get is not going to stay
valuable, no matter what its stats. The idol drops to the price of the
shoulders from Gullerback (maybe 100pp). So the net result is every tank
in the game over level 30 has a 10AC range slot item, mobs maybe die a
bit faster (or maybe get made harder to compensate).

And still no raids for anyone under level 45.
