Nope.  Weapon was overpowered, everyone knew it, needed to be nerfed.  A
game that left overpowered items in the game too long would quickly become
too easy, with no challenge.

And that's why GoD is a good expansion; it's extremely challenging.  No more
semi-afk healers during groups and raids; gotta be on your toes.  My only
complaint is that CR's are too long; I'd like to see a GoD GY.

And the things that DAoC patches screw up / make worse / need immediate
correcting make EQ patches look good by comparison.

BTW, CIHYS?
