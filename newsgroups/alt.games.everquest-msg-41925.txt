Why yes it does qualify the ones that keep making the same mistakes as being
morons.

I'm sorry I don't use a keypunch. :)


You seem to have missed the point as usual.  I posted my frustration on
having to do someone else's job that I pay for them to do.  So it's pretty
simple there must be some incompetent or lazy people working at Verant
otherwise 50% of patches wouldn't need repatched.  Also a simple process of
billing a credit card could be performed without errors.

Wouldn't you think even a simple minded person that's worth their wages
would say to themselves, this card was rejected and look at that vast amount
of information to see if they entered it correctly.
Let see now there's, 16 correct numbers, the correct expiration date, and
the correct name.  Wow that was really hard, they should take a vacation
after doing that.

 I'm willing to bet that persons response was, card rejected, I don't care
why or how.  All that will happen is when the customer logs on a message
will appear telling them there's a problem, the information is invalid.
They will call and see why then enter it again and the automated system will
fix the problem for me.

Lazy, incompetent, or stupid?
