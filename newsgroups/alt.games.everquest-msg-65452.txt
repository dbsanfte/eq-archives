Ok, so say 6 years from now in 2007 (or whenever...pick a time in the
future) should they still be supporting Win95 ( if EQ is still around then).
My point is eventually they'll have to dump it and they did.  I do think
they should do a recall on all the old boxes still on the shelf at your
local EB or whatnot.  Or at least send out little update stickers that
retailers can put over the spec area.  I imagine out there someone with
Win95 has already picked up a new copy of EQ not knowing about the Luclin
thing and bought it thinking it will work.  That would really piss me off,
but I imagine the store would probably take it back.
