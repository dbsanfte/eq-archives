I must admit it looks pretty.  I'd heard of open chat windows in new UI on
test were causing terrible video lag for people, but it didn't seem to be
bad for me.
One thing I *really* like...I can finally move the spell/song-timer window.
I keep most stuff near the bottom and to one side, so before I'd have to
look all the way to the top while twisting songs which could take away the
attention I could pay to surroundings.
One thing I am not too crazy about...all song gems are now different
graphics!  They look nice, but it will take a little playing to get used to
it.

Now I can't wait to try the bazaar!

What do the rest of you think of this little interface advancement?

SEAN...
