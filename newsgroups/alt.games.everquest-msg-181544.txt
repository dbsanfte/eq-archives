(haven't played until recently for 1.5 years, so I apologize if any of
the following has changed)

you will have skill == level you train it, so while it might help some,
it won't help a huge amount.

One other tip for starting SKs: Endure Cold is your friend. Whenever you
have time to kill (not as much nowadays with PoK travel), cast and
recast and recast Endure Cold (or whatever the low level cold resist
spell is) til abjuration is maxed for your level. You'll be glad at
level 30.
