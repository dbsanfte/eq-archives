   Timex-Sinclair also here.  No modem, but we did have a cassette
tape.  Problem was, the "computer" would power down everytime the
refrigerator fired up.  If you asked it what 7+9 was, it would take it a
about three or four seconds to figure it out (note, I am NOT joking
about this).
  Upgraded to a C-64.  Then we got a 300 baud modem.  The kind that you
would place the headset of the phone down into, as seen in the ancient
movie "Wargames".  I do no type well, but I could type faster than that
thing could load.
