Son, that was beautiful. No, I will never forget those that have
fallen in battle with me, nor to I take for granted the Police or
Firemen the protect me now as a civilian.
I live in Brooklyn and was at two ceremonies in the city I marched in
respect to those that died in country and overseas. My patriotism runs
deep. I had to quit my guild last year when it just got to hard to
play after losing 2 of my guild mates, It got really hard when Tony's
nephew started playing his account, It just got to weird seeing his 
Paly and it not really being him. A Paly.. go figure.

Well, thanks for understanding.
