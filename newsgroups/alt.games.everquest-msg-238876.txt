The place: Theatre of the Tranquil, Freeport
The time: 10.30pm, 18 January, 3174

'Hhmm, hm... Good to see you all, and thanks for coming... Anybody from 
Surefall Glade in the audience? No? Strange, because I "sure" see a 
"fall" in the numbers since I last played this venue, but I'm still 
"glade" to see you. He-hehe. Ahem. Good to see you, really... Anyway... 
Anybody from Halas either? No? Good. So... what do you call a Barbarian 
who marries an Orc? A social climber! Yeah! What do you say to a Gnome 
you have accidentally trod on? Nothing, you scrape him off the sole of 
your shoe and get him a rez! Haha-ha.'

'Hey!'

'Sorry, it looks like we *do* have a small contingent from Ak'Anon here 
tonight! Welcome! We like everybody here in Freeport! Particularly, we 
like'em pickled! Ask Boomba by the gate... Swell fellow, that Boomba. I 
hope a few of you will partake of his wares after the show. You see, I 
have this deal with him, it keeps me *outside* those jars of his. Swell, 
swell fellow. Really. Go back a long way him and I. We used to go quest 
a lot together, before he settled down. We did this looong and 
excruciatingly boring quest, and as a reward, I got this hammer, right? 
Not much in the way of stats, but it procs "Overhere Gate". It teleports 
you to your current location.' 

'...'

'"Overhere Gate", geddit? Oh, for the round breasts of Firiona, never 
mind. Anyway. I was grouped with this Ranger once, and he said "Let's go 
to Crushbone", and I looked at him... and he died. He... died! HEEHEHE. 
Died. Hm. Okey, moving on... I've seen a lot of Halfling Druids lately. 
So, what's it that draws Halflings to being Druids? Anybody? No? Must be 
that Thistlecoat spell... the little pricks. hahahahhh... hah. hah. hm.'

'My... tough crowd tonight... It reminds me of the night I played 
Befallen. Everyone was grinning, no one was laughing. The audience was a 
bit dead, you see? Hahaaha.. hah. Yeah, Befallen is rough... But you 
know what's rough? The Netherbians. "Netherbians, Netherbians, the 
fecking Netherbians..." as the song goes. Anyway, what's a Netherbian 
doing in Halas? Slumming! Hahahah... hah.. ha.'

'That tall guy at the back looks a bit blue in the face... half the face, 
at any rate. Is there a Cleric in the audience?'

'So, I was dating this Monk chick, right? Good at Feigning Death, she 
was. Particularly during sex. I think she was a chick anyway. Hard to 
tell with those Iksar...'

'Hey... that got *one* smile over there! We're making progress! The tall 
guy too... sorry about what I said about Halas. Smashing place, Halas. 
Good meat there... Beer's good too. I'm still hoping to find a place 
that sells it, rather than just rent it. HAHAHAh... hm. Sorry. Smashing 
place, as I said.'

'BUUUUUUUUURRP!'

'Excuse-me... I think I must have trod on a Froglok'

'So, what did the Fungusmen said when the Frogloks moved into Grobb? 
"There goes the neighbourhood!". Hahah... Don't get me wrong. I like 
frogs, myself. Their legs, particularly. Honest.'

'Anyway, thanks for coming... Good to see you all... see you around! If 
you are a Ranger, see you at your bind point! Take care! Never change! I 
love you all! Even the frogs! I love you! See you next Friday, same time, 
same place, same guy!'

'Bye!'

'Damn. That didn't go so great, did it?'
