This is actually the opposite of the way it occurs in nature. Look at many
species of birds and lizards; males are brightly colored to attract mates
and distract predators, while females are dully colored to blend in with the
background for protection. Verant should have made the male Iksars the ones
with brightly colored and patterned faces and elaborate head crests, not the
females.
