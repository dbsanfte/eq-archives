Being one of those people that goes back to 30baud acustic modem days, I 
know what I did.  There's no way in hell anyone nowadays could do that 
stuf and not get caught by the watchers on the net.

  I'm not a surf-nazi, I've taught my kids to be smart, but a parent has 
every right to know what their child is doing until that child leaves 
their parents house.  The ACLU needs to get smart and stop worrying 
about how much money they can collect from "oppressed people".
