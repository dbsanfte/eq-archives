Is there a way to log the activity of those buying from you in Bazaar?  I'd
like to be able to know who bought what from me.  There are times that I
come back to find I've mysteriously crashed to desktop (doesn't happen when
playing, just when inactive for long periods of time).  When this happens
I'm not able to see what was sold, I have to search through all my items to
find things that way.  Plus I'd like to be able to keep record in this way
(log file) of what was sold & for how much.  I've looked in my log file, but
can't find anything going by the text shown in the trader window.
