Kind of true, but misleading. If you get a box where the account key is
"already in use" you *can*, in fact, get a new one from VI, but as Max
says, not over the phone. I had that on our second installation, and
called them up. I was able to scan our CD cover with account key and our
receipt into a .jpg picture. I e-mailed it to them and they mailed back
a new account key the same day.
