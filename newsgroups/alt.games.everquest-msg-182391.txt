I can't say exactly which is the most fun to play 1-20, as it's been said,
it depends on the person.  I can give you a few suggestions on classes I
enjoyed and a few to avoid.

An Ogre SK is a lot of fun (can't speak for other races as I've not played
one) The strength makes them very tough for their level and if you were to
twink one a little then he'd be a real bad ass.

Mages-My daughter had a blast with a newbie Mage (can't remember the race
she chose) and she pretty much kicked-ass even at low levels.

Necro-(a lot of controversy on which race is best-but I played an Erudite)
It's really surprising how powerful they are at low levels and everyone I've
known who's played a Necro has loved the class.  A lot of people drop them
when they have to start researching spells because it's a real pain. So keep
that in mind, and start work early on gathering words, or making friends
with a necro with a high research skill that can make your combines for you.

Avoid
Wizards-Very weak at low levels.
Rogue-Same
I would say generally that clerics and enchanters would also be the most fun
after level 20 when there is more grouping but I don't know from experience
thats just a guess.
