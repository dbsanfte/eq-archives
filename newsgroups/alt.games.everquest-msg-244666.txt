That's a poor rationalization.  Most people are going to assume that you
know your guild's schedule, and so if you get involved in something that
will take, say, 60 minutes, it is because you know your guild won't need you
for that time.  Surely you don't think they should see your guild tag, and
think "He...that's a top raiding guild...I'd better go to their website and
see if they have anything planned, and send a tell to their officers, and
make sure this guy has time for my group"?
