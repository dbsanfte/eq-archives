That is interesting.  On Tholuxe I have been able to get pick-up
groups in KC and somewhat in Seb(haven't spent much time here yet so
my perspective is a bit limited) but it has been bring your own in
Chardok from what I have been able to tell the times I have been
there. I like KC one hell of a lot trains and all, always  have a
great time there with my 52 Bard especially if I don't have to do
crowd control..
