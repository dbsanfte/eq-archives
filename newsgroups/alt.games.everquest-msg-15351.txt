First, does your guild name actually mean anything in Norrathian terms, or
did your GL just like the sound of it?  If it's the latter it's a shame
someone has already spent money on domain registration.

Anyway.

The guild I'm in has been around since 8/99.  We require 2 sponsors +
officer must approve it.

Exceptions:

Officers/leaders can invite whomever they like.  If the officers and leaders
can't be trusted to invite good people without approval, why in the world
would they be an officer?

Real-life friends and relatives of guild members are USUALLY allowed in
without much trouble.  A second sponsor isn't required, but officer approval
is (we've said no a few times when the relative is a known dimwit).
