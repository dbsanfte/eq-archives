Benefit:

Your name is red

Problems:

No one can cast beneficial spells on you (heals, buffs, binds, etc),
there is no point in grouping with you since can't heal you/you can't
heal them, no one elses name is red for long,
your character is screwed unless you can get GM help.

You should not be able to go pvp on a regular server, ever. Verant has
left it in for 3 and a half years just for the marketing ability to
say you had a choice.
