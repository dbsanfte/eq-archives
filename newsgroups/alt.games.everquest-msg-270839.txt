Advanced is a synomym for complex, and I think is an appropriate one 
considering your apparent intended meaning.

> I said EQ2 is more complex,

And I said it isn't. Its a pretty simple game, and very much on par with 
WoW.

>  harder,

Again I disagree. I think its -slower-. But not harder. Getting to max 
level in EQ2 is a longer road than it is in WoW... but its not a harder 
one.

To which I alluded WoW perhaps deserves props for writing a better more 
intuitive UI.

So? The same is true of an inexperienced MMORPGer. It also says nothing 
about complexity or difficulty... just reinforces that progress in EQ2 
is slow as molasses by comparison. But a newbie might prefer that and an 
experienced player might not... ie there is no reason to suggest that 
WoW is more suited to newbies than EQ2 based on the fact that EQ2 takes 
longer to play.

For people that like to race to max level and get bored this will happen 
in any game. Newbies and Experienced MMORPGers alike.

Ah... well. Then your use of the word "complex" is completely 
inappropriate.  There is nothign more complicated about it. Its merely a 
different style of play. I'll grant that the overhead of finding a group 
and the need to 'make friends' in order to progress in EQ2 may be 
daunting to solo types... but that doesn't make the game harder or more 
complicated, it just underscores that EQ2 doesn't support solo 
playstyles very well.

OK. But that's just saying that different play styles will prefer 
different games. And I already agreed with that. What I disagree with 
your assertion that EQ2 is more complex than WoW, and that EQ2 is aimed 
at MMOG vets while WoW is aimed at newbies.

> A game being complex doesn't make it better or more advanced than
> another, just makes it attractive to some types of players.

When you divided the players into the groups "newbies" and "experienced 
MMORPGers" based on comparative complexity, then the conclusion that you 
think EQ2 is more advanced is inescapable.


And ultimately its silly, because EQ2 really isn't more complicated. 

At most its somewhat more restrictive because you practically *have* to 
group to *anywhere*. But that doesn't make it more complicated nor more 
difficult a game.

At least you recognize there is no inherent connection between 
complexity and fun. (Although some people do delight in the surfeit of 
details in a complex system...)
