I play a skirmisher and I'm at level 10 now, and beginning to see the 
charm in joining teams. However, I can still quite easily take on hordes 
of enemies, a small group of blues at a time, or one or two yellows. The 
team-work really helps me to rack up the experience, but like I say, I 
can also solo easily too.
