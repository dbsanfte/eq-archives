Im hoping its not some goofy radar system ala Asheron's Call. Wouldnt
suprise me tho, considering they essentially integrated EQW into EQ,
is this a coming of ShowEQ of some kind? Highly doubtful - the
druids/rangers/bards would have more to scream about, since that would
essentially render tracking useless. Its probably going to be as you
described, an auto mapping feature. I just hope that the maps are more
usefull than that crappy EQ Atlas they published.
