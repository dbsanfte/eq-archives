I am under no obligation to do so.  That I and a substantial number of
others consider your inspection without asking to be rude should be,
in and of itself, sufficient to dissuade you from doing it.

I could give a rat's ass whether *you* think it's rude.  What matters
is whether the person the action is being done to objects to it.  It's
called being sensitive to others.  There is no "logical" reason not to
chew with your mouth open and yet we don't.  Well, some of us don't...

Again.

What is rudeness other than persisting in behaviour you're well aware
another might find offensive?
