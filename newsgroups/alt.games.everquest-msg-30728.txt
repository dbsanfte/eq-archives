Buch of idiots post in reply to this I see.

The rules of haste stacking go like this. SPELLS with stack with ITEM
haste, but not with another ITEM. If you have a venreable Mithril 2HS
(which has inate haste) it WILL NOT stack with an item like a FBSS. A
Cloak Of Flames therefore will NOT stack with a FBSS. However items
that PROC Haste (because it is considered a spell like ALL procs) like
the Executioners Axe WILL Stack with item Haste.

In short, a FBSS WILL STACK with the Haste Proc on an Exe Axe. Its one
of the reasons the combination was considered "ohh so uber" all those
years ago.

Trust me I know.
