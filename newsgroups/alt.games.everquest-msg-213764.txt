i use EQ companion

it's not bad....

the spreadsheet-style info reporting it does contains a lot of info i'd
rather not have displayed, but there's no way to turn it off

and my version is old, and it doesn't know how to parse "soandso heals you
for xxxx damage" hehehe

and it doesn't have any way to add in pet procs, so you have to ask the
mage/bst/whatever what the effects are, then add them into their damage,
then do the math manually, heheheehe

i think it's fun, but that YALP thing sounds good too
