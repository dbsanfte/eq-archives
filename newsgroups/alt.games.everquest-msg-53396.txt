That's incorrect.  Cnsdr ths, fr xmpl, whch grtly rdcs my tpng, wthut
obsc th mning.  That sentence was NOT worthwhile, even though it
reduced my typing, and did not fatally obscure the meaning.

Good readers do NOT read by looking at the words a letter at a time,
sounding them out, and then recognizing the sound.  Good readers
recognize complete words.  Any new abbreviation, however logical, will
slow down readers.  Since there are many more readers than writers for
a given message (if not, someone is doing something wrong!), saving a
few keystrokes ONCE for the writer is not worthwhile when the cost is
slowing down many many readers.
