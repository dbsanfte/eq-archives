Can you get skill points faster by trying combos that are well above your
trivial level?

At skill 191, the next triv is black pearls (no avail at vendors).  Skip it
and go to the next avail stone at vendors? Skip all the 50pp - 90 pp stones
and try doing cheap gems with plat bars?

What would you think my % chance of success would be walking around trying
to make plat str/int/wis items (235-245) with my 191 skill? Is there a
formula?

Thanks
