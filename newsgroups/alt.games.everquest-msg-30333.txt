You need either 2 IP addresses (often an additional monthly charge from
your cable company). Alternatively you can have 1 external IP address,
and use a NAT router to send stuff to the right PC, each of which will
have a seperate internal IP address on your LAN. You'll need:

a) a hardware router and a NIC in each PC, probably won't need a
seperate hub since you can get a router with a small hub built in.

or

b) a software router (ICS, Wingate, Sygate, etc), 2 NICs in the main PC
(one for the cable connection, 1 out to your LAN), 1 in the client PC
and a hub to plug them all into (or a crossover cable if its just 2 PCs)


See http://www.practicallynetworked.com

Make sure you open up the UDP ports EQ uses. If you go the Windows ICS
route, download ICS config and the Everquest settings file for it from
that site to do this, otherwise make sure your router isn't trying to be
a rabid firewall etc.
