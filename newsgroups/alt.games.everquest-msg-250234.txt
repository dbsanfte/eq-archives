I think he's saying that the Magus won't transport him anywhere
because he doesn't (and can't, at his level) have an Adventurer's
Stone.  I haven't ever been to Nedaria's Landing with a character
that didn't already have the stone (have to admit I don't know how
to get there except by Magus-port), so I don't know if the Magus
there offers Abysmal-port to all or not.
