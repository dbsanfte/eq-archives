    There's some confusion here about what level of rogue we're talking
about, I think. But I will note that after level 39 or so, everyone has
access to the most powerful heal of all (Complete Healing) in group
environments.

    Sadly, all this extra AC means crap-all because of the AC "soft cap".
Past a certain point, AC has massively diminishing returns. That point is
low enough that at higher levels, rogues reach or come close to the AC cap
with full raid buffs. Once you reach the cap, the primary determinant of
what you can tank is pure HPs. Rogues already have some of the best
defensive skills caps in the game, as an aside.

    At lower levels, it depends on whether the rogue is twinked or not. If
you're looking at twinks, someone in Mrylokar's/Barbed/Crystal Chitin is
going to have a very similar AC to someone in Cobalt/Barbed/Crystal Chitin.
The one factor working against the rogue is if they've been taking it easy
and evading as they level up instead of working defense - ironically the
PL'ed rogue is more likely to have a good AC compared with the non-PL'ed
rogue here.

    If you ever want to see a rogue that shows exactly what the class is
capable of, go to Afterlife's web site and look at the profile of the
man-beast known as Hobben. Best equipped rogue in EQ. HE can tank. =)
