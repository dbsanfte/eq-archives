Actually, that's a pretty decent ratio on that weapon, and it procs a
LOT, even in my off-hand.  Used it on my Trak run Thursday, even the
Juggs didn't resist it very often.  I'm working to get my 1hb maxxed
so that I don't feel like a gimp when I finally get a Blam Stick
(30/40 1hb, primary only, drop in Plane of Mischief).  Damn monks are
all getting them but none for the bard, yet.

Yeah, our warriors were amazed to find something that they would play
with.  Of course it was dropped off of the Blood Reaver, so I guess it
was sort of level appropriate.   I'm still not sure why people think
he is so tough.  As long as you know you have to be within melee range
to cast, and that he doesn't resist melee, he drops pretty easily.  A
zergling rush is NOT the proper strategy.

really enjoyed the break between raids
