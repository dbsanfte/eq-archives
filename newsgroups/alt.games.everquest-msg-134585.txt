Yay, I've been wishing for an option to turn off those models too, and
I don't really like the vah shir models as it is :)

>** Spells **

Hehe, why couldn't they have done this while I was still exping
outdoors? It'll still be useful, though, especially while chasing
velium hounds :) (Not to mention that all my baby druids will get to
dot kite, mwuwhahahah!)
Would rather they'd removed the healing penalty.

My little mage will be quite pleased with this :)

Hmm, wonder what this will do to having a charmed bat get the guards
to kill the Kelethin POD?

LOL!

And this should make Furor happy.

Nice one.

Really hope this works properly!
