It will, and you've picked a good one (my favorite 35-50).

BYOG on Zeb.  Don't know about other servers

Oh, 34 should be ok (Superior Healing).  A little lower if you've got other
healing support.

> 3) Should I buy invis potions for the trip to the camp area?
Nope, everything in SolB sees through it.

> 4) Anything else I should know about this place?
- The Noble charms. :)
- If you're pre-40 in a pre-40 group, if you see anything but a kobold, be
prepared to run.
- There are 6 zone lines (5 from SolA), four of which you'll likely run into
if you ever end up pulling.
- Decent xp, decent cash, decent vendor loot.  Not much in the way of player
loot, though the runed mithril bracers from the King are very nice.  Oh, and
the Golden Efreeti Boots (GEBs...those ugly yellow boots) are really hard to
beat for INT/WIS, but to get THERE you need a 50+ group (or a talented 45+)
including an enchanter or a bard good at crowd control.
