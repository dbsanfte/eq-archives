I realize that you'd have to read a name once, but if a name bothers 
you, why not just add the person to your /ignore list.  I do that to 
people who spam and can't figure out how to chat with their buds without 
using the shout channel all the time.  Sooooo much easier than 
petitioning the GM.  Only ever have to hear from them once or twice, 
then its as if they were never there.
