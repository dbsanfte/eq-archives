Unless you are going to babysit them until they get to the point where they
to buy the other expansions, this is a bad idea.  Most people they meet and
might want to group with will have most of the expansions, and expect others
to have them, too.

For example, what happens when your Trilogy friends are in, say, GFay, and
get into a group?  The group wants to go somewhere in Luclin.  Oops...well,
maybe the group will be nice and will be willing to go to HHK instead.  So,
the group heads off to the PoK book...and then your friends have to explain
that they need to take the boat.

Or how about just running through zones?  The group will assume everyone can
pop up an LoY map.  Your friends will get lost more than the people with
maps.

Sony is clever.  In most expansions they have introduced features that
enhance the game significantly for players who are lower level than the
expansion zones and who are in the pre-expansion zones, so that people will
have a reason to buy the expansion even if it is mostly aimed at people
other than them.

Trilogy is cheap now because it is junk.
