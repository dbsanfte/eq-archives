<<<<<He (and many others here) can also do what you claim to be "impossible"
without KEI - keep telling yourself you match them on a skill, knowledge and
understanding level though when you admit you can't proceed without KEI.

Who are you?  You make me laugh with your need to create your own
self-importance through a pc game.  I never once said that I can't proceed
without KEI but make up what you need to keep your little ego up.  It's the
same with all you guys that want KEI only for high levels.  You all have very
low self esteem which you try to pump up by playing a pc game for hours and
hours and hours and now that you've gotten yourselves uber you don't want
anyone else to get to the same level you've achieved.  It's easy to see.  It's
too bad that your own self worth is so tied to this game.  It would be nice if
you could just live and let live.  But you can't because you're a pathetic
person.  It doesn't take talent or skill to play this stupid game.  It's a
game.
