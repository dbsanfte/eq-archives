    Actually, there is no San Diego / Chula Vista zoning, since the National City
zone is in the way.  Not that I can blame you for forgetting about it.  It is pretty
much a "get out as quickly as you can" place, and the unfortunate souls that are
stuck there have pretty much given up on leveling or faction work.

Annie <--- Lives about 7 miles from National City, and luckily only has to drive
through it once or 
           twice a year.  Less, if she can help it.
