Ok..... there's no question here... just a story of success, both on the
/ooc hardware front, and ingame on the EQ uber-fight front. If that
doesn't interest you, move on.

Thanks to the excellent help from a list of people here in a.g.e too
long to mention, I got an education in computer reconstruction, etc. to
try to rebuild my system. In the latest (and for now let's hope *last*)
round, I ripped the crap video card out of my IBM machine and replaced
it with a PCI version of the GF2 MX 400 (64 MB RAM) video card. It
worked. I was able to turn up my textures to max and have a lot of the
character models turned on. And I was wondering about a good place to
really test it out and see if performance was up to spec.

I'm a 51 Champion. I get invited on a lot of pickup raids. Tonight,
while playing with my new graphics, I got invited by a nice guy we know
to go on a Naggy raid. He was short on people so Tiru and I went to join
him while most other folks were on Luclin. What better place to stress
test your graphics? It worked fantastic! I invited a couple groups worth
of people from my guild, including the ever fearless Orlun, who posts
here often. We went. The system performed just like the old days. I had
almost no lag in the middle of a damn dragon raid. It rocked, and I
thank you all!

Then...... we killed Naggy. And Naggy, for the first time in the seven
times I've killed the bastard, dropped the red scale. He only dropped
FOUR items, cheap freaking dragon. But he dropped the scale. The raid
leader called for all warriors and bards to roll random 1 to 1000.  

I rolled a 976.

I not only have a working EQ system that can handle the latest version
of EQ. I have a piece of my epic that some Warlords are still waiting
for. In EQ terms.......... I've had a pretty good fucking day.

Thank you all again. 

I'm one happy Champion.
