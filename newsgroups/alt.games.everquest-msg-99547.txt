Dont know what world youve been in but it happens all the time. Yes,
plenty of clerics passing through but none willing to spend a couple
of seconds to cast rez on you. Try playing a solo necro in skyfire
mountains without jboots to help you run or a guild to bail you out.
Died many times there post 50 and now i just dont even ask for a rez
anymore. Really pissed me off when i saw a cleric go by into BW and my
body was right at BW zone. I zoned over and asked politely if i could
get a rez since the body was so close all he would have to do is zone
over and cast. I was willing to pay a couple hundred plat too. He was
sitting on the ground in front of me medding (with his back to me) and
replied that he was halfway across the zone already almost to chardok
and couldnt come back. Then i poked him. Hehehe.....just say no if you
dont want to....a really lame lie just makes you look dumb. HAHA next
week I was there getting xp and farming spells when I see a full group
port in and run to BW zone. Then i noticed that something was aggroed
on them and lo and behold lil cleric was getting a beating from an
ancient wurm and the rest of them running for their lives. I was
already watching my own Jabober kill another wurm and right about that
time my isp disconnects and i go LD. I log back in and "see dead
people"! Seems that my wurm joined in the fray. They managed to rez
everyone :P

Lets face it, a rez is pretty much only a hassle for a cleric if he
has to travel to get to the body. I know its mana intensive but so are
ports for my 31 druid. Necros on the other hand have 175pp coffins to
carry around to do corpse summons. Since druids are porting for 20pp
and up and clerics OOC for their rez services for 150pp and up how
much do you think a corpse summon from the bowels of some dungeon is
worth? I get tells from someone and i say itll cost 200pp for me to go
into chardok and do a summon and they freak out and call me GREEDY.
Jeez....why dont they just remove all classes from the game except
warrior and cleric :PPP
