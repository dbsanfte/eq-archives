It's not so much what spells you use the most of, but when you use those
spells that spec in evocation really pays dividends for solo mages. Your
conjuration spell reportoir can mostly be cast in nice safe downtime where
you can just sit on your but and med up again to full before pulling.

The Evocation though is used in the thick of battle when every single mana
point can mean the difference between life and another "loading...please
wait". Being able to squeeze out an extra bolt or rain can be vitally
critical, whereas cheaper summoning just means a little less time spent on
your butt before the pull.

I chose evocation with that reasoning in mind but my baby mage has just
dinged 26 so I don't know if it was wise or not yet.
