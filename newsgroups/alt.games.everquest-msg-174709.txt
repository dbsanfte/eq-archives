	Not enough core classes.  The guild's very few high-level tanks and
DPS'ers got themselves and their cliques flagged, and sent everyone else
packing.  Just the lack of anyone who could tank stopped the ancillary classes
cold.

|Not necessarily. As I asked above, how did the 63+ crowd get through
|them when they had no one to PL them?

	A number of them got themselves flagged with help from the E'ci public
raid force, which is essentially an untagged guild (the "Ashorty" chat
channel, named after the 65 ENC who serves as Big Kahuna).  Many of Ash's
raiders are substantially better equipped that the norm for our guild.

	I was off working on EndQ/AM3 while all this went down, because Hunter
status is better than level 65 for Rangers, and staying at level 60 because it
gave me the widest possible range of targets.  Levelling past 60 would have
removed my ability to solo effectively without increasing my ability to get
into groups.  I had, in fact, levelled to 61 when PoP came out and then
de-levelled back to 60 to finish my AAs for that reason.  By the time I was
done, the unflagged members of the guild had been summarily dismissed so I
didn't bother asking for help.  

	A week or two later I happened to mention in Ashorty that I wasn't
flagged, and received an instantaneous /tell from Ash himself to come to
Justice and get flagged.  I was flagged within the hour.  He did it for his
own reasons, of course; he wanted another bow on his raids, a sentiment borne
out by the following day's Aerin'dar raid which was basically carried by the
Rangers.  

<digression>

	We had over a dozen Rangers, at least five of them Hunters.  Failed
Attempt #1: lackwitted casters decide that hiding over by the Rangers (who are
known to be out of AE range) is a good idea, nuke early, pull Dragon directly
to Rangers about five seconds after Trueshot is called, all Rangers instantly
killed, raid wipes immediately thereafter.  Failed Attempt #2: deputy raid
leader decides she doesn't want to wait for Trueshot to recycle and we try
again, Dragon is pushed into the wall, thereby eliminating Archery damage,
raid wipes with Dragon at less than 10%.  Successful Attempt: Dragon is kept
(more or less) steady and away from the wall and get perforated.  Large
casualties among non-Rangers due to the AE means chaos in dealing with the
adds, but people get organized and put them down.  During all three attempts,
numerous comparisons are made to TTT and the Battle of Helm's Deep, as the air
over the raid was full of arrows the whole time.

</digression>

|Then why worry about it yet? If they are a liability in those planes,
|why do they feel they need flagged?

	The vast majority of the people with flag issues were 60+.  The defecit
was more in classes than levels, and the underying issues were basically
cliques and the fact that the public raids had basically removed any benefit
from being in the guild.
