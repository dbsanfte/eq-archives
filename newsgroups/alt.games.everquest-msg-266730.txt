Heh, I liked Freeport better than Qeynos.  No accounting for taste, I
guess.  I'm disappointed with the lack of voiceovers, though, Qeynos
was much more complete.  I didn't realise how much they added until
they went missing. :-/

Being a subclass won't make you unique, everyone else of the same
subclass is still just the same to exactly the same extent.  I don't
understand this need to be different through class choice, your
character is in how you play, anyway.  I guess it will be a little
boring to replay an archetype to reach a different class, but that
doesn't take more than a couple of hours if you know your way around.

There are boats, or were in beta at least.  The docks in Antonica just
outside Qeynos has a ship that arrives occasionally and takes you to
Thundering Steppes (which can't be reached via the bell).

The bells are only for short distances - within the cities and just
outside, for the ones in the cities.
