Which haste is that?  I've had both shaman and enchanters stack haste 
right on top of my burnout, I've never had anything cast on my pet that 
made burnout bounce off, either.  Its possible that they are trying to 
cast something that bounces off burnout, then not mentioning it to me, 
but there's at least something they can cast that does stack.
