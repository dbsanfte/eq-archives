perhaps not criminal law, but definitely civil law. Breaking a
contract is a violation of civil law, and EULA's are considered
binding contracts except in cases where terms wouldn't even be legal
on a paper contract.

I do not think witchcraft is a religion, and I do not think it is in any 
way appropriate for the U.S. military to promote it.

-- George W. Bush, October 15, 2000 

(Notice how Bush does away with the Wiccan's right to religious liberty
by redefining Wicca as not a religion and further denigrating it with 
the term witchcraft.)
