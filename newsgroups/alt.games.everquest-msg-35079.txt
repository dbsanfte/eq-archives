Not too long ago I went to Najena to get the items for the Mage focus quests
for my Mage twink, and it was impossible for me to take a few steps without
one of these skells jumping me.  In about the 3 hours it took for me to get
all 4 focus items, I saw maybe 4 of the hilts drop.  They do seem quite
rare.
