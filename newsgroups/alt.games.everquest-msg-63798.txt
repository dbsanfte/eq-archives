*boggle* I would think the cleric and necro would be he easiest to level. Ok
heres what I would do...
Cleric: Go to the overthere, get in a group. At 40 go to DL, get in a group.
Necro: Go and fear kite something. (pull with darkness, pet, dot, fear, more
dot etc). Outside paw is easy, Pillars west of loio, open area north of
giant fort in fm, are some to name a few. At 34 (with your new pet and fear)
you could probably kite stuff in OT near the outpost.
