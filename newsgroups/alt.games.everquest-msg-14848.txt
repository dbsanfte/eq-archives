It's rude to barge in on people's fights without asking when it's
clear they don't need help. Period. The guy still got the xp, yeah,
but the one who finished off the bear may not have known for sure he
would have. I'd be perfectly willing to wager the snert didn't even
look to see how far along the bear was on health, and that Ryo. only
got lucky in that he still got the xp.

It irritates the hell out of me when some high levels think they have
to take pot-shots at every mob they see, whether someone's fighting it
or not, as they run through newbie zones.
