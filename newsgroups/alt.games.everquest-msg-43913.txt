I know what you mean.. I suspect my quick burnout on EQ was due partly to
playing AC for almost 1-1/2 years. Only took me about 3-4 months to burn out
on EQ. So far DAOC has kept my interest up for a month - it is enough
different without the aggravations of EQ that it at least does not piss me
off when I get on...

My 46 druid I gave away to guildies.. Have not decided what to do with my 49
Ranger yet. I may just give it away to guildies also.
