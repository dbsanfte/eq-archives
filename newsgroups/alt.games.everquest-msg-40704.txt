Ok I stopped playing last year sometime.....I decided I'll go ahead and try
to play again but either I forgot my password....or its just not letting me
restart my account..

I thought since I canceled my account I would just have to try to
connect...then it should ask if I wanted start my account again..but instead
it just says invalid username/password

I can't find anything about e-mailing a forgotten password......What can I
do!?
