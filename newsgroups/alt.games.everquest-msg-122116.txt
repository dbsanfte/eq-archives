Just takes patience! I have done all six armor and weapon quests, and
have only a Giant Yellowjacket Thorax to go for my Warrior and the
Weapon part for my Cleric. All others are done. While I like the nodrop
factor to the resulting items, nodrop ingredients are a farce! I set out
to prove this and have succeeded. My Druid has never killed a single
mob, and has his complete newbie armor set and weapon. The only
experience he has is from turning in the head to get his weapon........
Some of these drops are ridiculously rare, and would be a nice addition
to the economy if all items except the resulting armor pieces were
tradable...
