No, I thought that Verant took them more or less from hobbits. The likeness
to me is almost unmistakable. Certainly Verant's storyline is their own, and
I'm pretty sure that Peter Jackson didn't sit down and say "I really like
EQ, I think I'm going to incorporate some of it into my film" :) And I
actually thought that Tolkien did invent much of that -- barring the
centuries old legends of elves and brownies and sprites and such things. It
seemed to me that he did at least give them new life. Is there something
else published before Tolkien that I should read? (besides the legends and
myths and such, I mean)

thanks,

Darklet
