Ok, one last post and to bed for sure but this one can't be resisted I'm
afraid.  What makes anyone think that because he uses the strategy of
employing KEI to prevent a basically manaless casting class at level 1 thru,
you pick it, to run out of mana for multiple levels he will develoup into a
hopless mana ignorant fool?  He gets spell upgrads every x levels depending
on the class and each upgrade of a particular spell line consumes more mana
so there is actually an ongoing learning curve each time, until perhaps mid
or upper twentys, a caster aquires new upgraded spell and/or a totally new
spell isn't there?

Why isn't it possible for him to observe his mana useage as he levels even
with KEI... I'm sure few people who created a caster don't know how much
mana they have at each new level until it levels of and finally stops
increasing at 200 Wis/Int... over 200 is a 1 to 1 increase which in my
opinion is a waste of a gear stats.

He uses what the game provides in a way he precives as an advantage so whats
wrong with that?  I was taught in the Military that this kind of thinking
was an asset everyone should want to posses.  Use and take advantage of the
resourses available.   If a player is so dim witted as to not becomming mana
savay by around level 20 or so, with the use of KEI or not, then they
probably will never understand mana usage anyway so it dosn't matter if they
use KEI.

You will get your way in time since I believe KEI will be nerfed and in the
not to distant future so let thoes who want to take advantage of it do so.
You know, when I started this game I had no gear and no plat beyond what was
need to buy food, water and an occassional pathotic peice of nearly useless
gear.  But I don't resent players who start out with nice or even great gear
and I don't wish them to have to endure the frustrations, and at times,
dreadfully slow advancement I endured for quite some time just because I had
to.  All totalled, deleted as well as current characters I have done
probably close to 300 levels and I've come close to total burn-out several
times.  Of the 300 odd levels the majority have been at best boring to
mildly enjoyable.  For me its gettting that great peice of loot worth
several K that is the payoff, not the leveling or questing or raiding so
until at least the late 40's I'm just doing what I have to do to get where I
can do what I get off on.  For others its leveling or raiding or questing or
whatever...  If I were meandering through a zone and saw you being chased by
a couple angry mobs I'd try and keep you from getting killed and maybe
loosing hard earned exp and I suspect you'd do the same, so why not entend
that to all facits of the game.

Just my opinion and I know its meaningless and trivial to many but its how I
feel so I'm stuck with it.  Isn't it the differences we all have that makes
life so interesting anyway?  Hell I hardly missed playing these last endless
patching hours!!!  Grrrrrrr....
