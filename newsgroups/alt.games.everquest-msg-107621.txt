Actually, wolf form does work on ogres (except warrior guild, SKs were ok
though), I've never tried it on the trolls though.

Assuming you haven't slaughtered trolls or ogres somewhere, since faction is
only modified a set amount in wolf form (usually good in old world but bad
in kunark and beyond, as well as Halas, if you have high enough faction,
you'll still be non kos in wolf in kunark and velious, I haven't tried in
luclin yet)

Wood elf druids of Tunare start out low enough though on dark elf faction
that even in wolf form we're kos in nektulos.
