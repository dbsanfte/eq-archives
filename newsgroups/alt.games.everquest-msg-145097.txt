The mage community whined about being broken
for so long, that many people don't realize 
that we're one of the best raw damage dealers
in XP groups, and do decent damage on a large
percentage of raid mobs, if we aren't summoning 
rods.

Also, for XP groups, the thing that counts
is damage/mana ration on nukes, and we are
closer to 80% of wizard ability there.
