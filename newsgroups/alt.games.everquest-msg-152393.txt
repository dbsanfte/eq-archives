Actualy Tyger i don't think their is a consensus on this, Ie, the pre patch
warder at 39 was already 2 times weaker then it was suposed to be,  before
the patch nerf, according to VI's pet designer the warder is suposed to be
just under a mage pet in power. VI was aware that our warders damage was to
low because they  had mistakenly capped its H2H @ 100 etc.
