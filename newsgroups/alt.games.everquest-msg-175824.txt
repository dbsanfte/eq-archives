as a friend pointed out:
1) the site doesn't say that those are the ONLY classes that froglogs can
be.
2) if you look at the AVI's, it shows a flying kick and a dragon punch.

i'm thinking they might let 'em be monks ;)

my girlfriend was complaining that she's tired of being an iksar monk, but
doesn't want to be a human, but still wants to be a monk as well!
