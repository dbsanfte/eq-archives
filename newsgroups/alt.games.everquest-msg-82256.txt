There's only one "i" in "him".

Witty.  "Hate yourselves".  Very creative.

Wbrownlee is a newbie.  She's learning.  Tyger and Bizbee, whatever
you might think of their personalities, have on many occasions
contributed to constructive conversations here about the game and it's
mechanics.

YOU on the other hand have NEVER contributed to conversation here. 

Take that for what it's worth.

"Reproduced"?  I'd probably go more with 'spawned'.

No, the apple doesn't tend to fall far from the tree, I'll concede
that point.

Poor kids.

Agree with whom?  Nobody said it was mean before you just did?

It's really no fun when you make it this easy.  Please, work a little
harder next time.

Two things:

1.  Top posting if for semi literate morons.

2.  If this is going to be your first contribution to
alt.games.everquest, please spare us a second.

Thank you and good night.
