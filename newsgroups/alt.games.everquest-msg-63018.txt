Over the Halloween weekend, with all the incredibly fast spawn rates, we
ended up with two Talendors up in Skyfire.  One was walking the normal beat
up by VP, the other was "homeless", no wander path and he didn't go back to
his spawn point.  He'd just hang out wherever he was pulled and corpse
camp.

Made for an incredible sneak only CRs and I got some great screen shots
too...
