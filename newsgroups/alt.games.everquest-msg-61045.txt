Your story sounds like you are a ranger who primarily solo's. I may be
wrong, but that whole "screwing your mother, brother, etc." thing sounds
that way. If you want to solo in your forties, and make great xp *and*
loot, well........ drop some LSD and report back on your dreams.

Now, however, if you can make some friends to group with in otherwise
empty zones, take a few and go to City of Mist. Or one of several
others, but that's my favorite late thirties to early forties spot.
You'll make great xp and loot both. But you won't solo it. Druids don't
even solo there. Necros allegedly can, but it's really living on the
edge.
