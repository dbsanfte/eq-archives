    Would have to be the day my friends and I assaulted Befallen as a bunch
of teens. We were hopelessly outgunned and wiped at least twice but STILL
made good experience and the VERY tense tactical situation was absolutely
wonderful. Since I had invis-vs undead and to begin with at least good
faction with the necros (I'm an SK :) I was exploring and pulling for the
group. Moving us from one room to another was a very tense and exciting
operation.

    Best day ever in the game, nothing's beaten it since, not even the first
time I fear kited a hill giant (just as heart-pounding but not as much
group-fun cos it was solo).
