Wisps.  Kill wisps in the commonlands and collect the lightstones and
Greater lightstones.  If you're more interested in money, sell the
lightstones to a vendor for about 1pp each and save the GLS.  Once you
get full of GLS, head over to the Gypsy camp in Oasis and turn the GLS
into one of the gypsy chicks.  She'll give you GOOD exp and a book
that you can sell back to her for about 7pp to 9pp, depending on your
charisma.

I did this with my enchanter from level 11ish to 15 and I got well
over 500pp in the bank now.
