Bought two rebreathers last night for my warriors epic quest. I'd found
out about a gnome wizzy selling them for 1500 plat each. The warrior
online guides mostly say to be prepared to pay more than that, and
previously I'd not seen them for less than 2K each. But the gnome seemed
*very* happy to complete the transaction, and some folks in our guild
were talking about trying to find them cheaper. 

What prices are these things drawing these days on various servers? I
always kind of figured that tinkering rebreathers was a limited niche
market and the price wouldn't ever plunge much, regardless of what else
happened to the "player driven economy".
