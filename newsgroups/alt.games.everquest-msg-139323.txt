In my experience, non summoning mobs don't do anything crazy when
blinded with anyone on their hate list in melee range.  Sort of like
rooted, they will take whatever they can hit.  I've never seen a blind
mob turn and rush a nuker, or a CHealer... or run off in a random
direction, which Davian's suggestion would make them do at least
on occaision.

I dont' flash much while not trying to cleric tank, but I certainly have
seen  paladins do it a LOT over a wide range of levels, and it seems
to be quite functional.  As cleric tank, I have found that it seems to
help, its hard keeping aggro off my druid buddy normally, but if
I flash/stun/root as fast as the bubbles come up, I can keep its attention
most of the time (heck, it has to stand still, can't see to go anywhere
anyway, and is having some trouble even getting a spell off!) so the
druid can happily DOT, and in addition to my pathetic melee damage,
I'm turning in (32+15) 47 points every time it hits me due to DS plus
MOR.  Then I back off, heal myself, and dive back in... mob is rooted,
blind, and snared, backing off is rarely a problem!

Neither Flash nor Root seem to do a thing to prevent mobs from
casting on people at range, by the way, so this tactic works a bit better
on melee mobs.
