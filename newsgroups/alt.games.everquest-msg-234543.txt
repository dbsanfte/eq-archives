make plat no-rent

spend it or lose it.

simultaneously: nerf gem and other stackable item sellback prices big
time, but increase plat drops (so you can purchase tradeskill comps,
peridots, etc without undue effort)

The game goes to basically a barter system, with enough plat lying
around for merchant interactions. (buying food, tradeskill items, etc)

Give us npc merchants that take specified trades. (npc, because items
will take longer to move in a barter systems) Inevitably, player
brokers will fill a much needed niche of facilitating more elaborate
trades, possibly for minor items (like stacks of tradeskill
subcombines... or other readily available high demand currencies)

The advantage is that spidersilks cannot be produced en-masse. They
must a) be farmed, and b) there is a fixed and pretty low limit to how
many you can carry... you aren't going to be buying 100,000 spider
silks from yantis and flipping them for ornate ...

Large ticket merchant items can be bought on "layaway". (by buying
much cheaper no-drop tokens that can be redeemed en mass for the
specific item) The tokens can't be currency because they are no-drop.

well.. that was off the cuff... tear holes in it as you see fit... I'm
curious where they are.

hmmm... plat doesn't really have to be no-rent to get these
benefits... it could just be no-drop.

In which case... augment the loot system to properly autosplit (break
plat into gold in the field...i don't care if its unrealistic)
