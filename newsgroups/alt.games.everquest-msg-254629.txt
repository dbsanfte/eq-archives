There are a few other factors.  Different races have different xp 
modifiers, some classes get an xp bonus.  Grouping gives an xp bonus.  
Killing mobs that are lt blue gives half the normal xp (I think it's 
half).  Killing green mobs gives no xp.  Killing mobs that are close in 
level to your level or above gives an xp bonus (at least at high levels).  
Those are just off the top of my head.
