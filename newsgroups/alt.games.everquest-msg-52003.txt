Yes, they skill up so they can make the item for themselves.  This doesn't
make the tradeskills a viable alternative to killing mobs for the purposes
of making money, which is what this debate is about.  Once all the items are
made, then the trade skills won't be practiced any more until another item
is thrown in as an incentive.  Go make a character, twink him down 100
platinum pieces and start him off in blacksmithing.  When you run out of
money you are out and won't be able to get any more through your
blacksmithing trade.  The reason you won't is because the economy is
saturated with items, and the reason it is saturated is because items don't
deteriorate.

Not at all.  They are not too expensive to make *if* there is a market.  In
DAoC the items can be made and the mark-up is determined by competition.
The competition is the npc vendors which can conveniently be tweaked by the
designers.  They are not too expensive to make *if* you can sell them for a
mark-up.  As an example go buy 1000 widgets whole-sale for 20 dollars
apiece.  $20,000 is a pretty good chunk of change to some people, but most
people could reasonably come up with it.  You hope to be able to sell them
at a 20% markup and make yourself a tidy profit of $4000.  Now, if you can't
unload those widgets then that $20,000 turns from an investment into a
liability, just like the plat a newbie would have to spend on blacksmithing.
He can't sell his wears because the EQ economy is saturated.

Right, so they twink it down to any lower level characters that want it,
including their own.  Ah, but wait, they don't really even twink it down
anymore, though they did at one time.  Why?  Because there is so much armor
on the server that is vastly superior to banded and *it* never goes away
either.  There is nothing that players can make with the trade skills that
anybody would want because there is so much on the server already that is
much more valuable.  When VI adds some nifty new item that can only be made
via tradeskills, then they are used once again, for a short while, til
everybody has one, and since they never go away, everybody who has one will
always have one, and again, stagnation, now at the high end as well.

<puzzled look>  So now it looks as if you are *agreeing* that the economy in
EQ is saturated and this is because the game wouldn't be fun otherwise.


<snip futile debate>

Dude, it is really very silly to argue that there is a good, viable and
stable economy in EQ.  There isn't.  There *is* and economy.  It is inflated
and saturated.  I hate to take on a condescending attitude, but the fact is
if you researched the subject then you couldn't possibly argue this point.

I feel that the inflated, saturated, prolematic economy hinders many aspects
of the game that seemed to have a lot of potential, such as the tradeskills.
Many people.. in fact most people, don't seem feel this way, or aren't
really aware of the economy problems in everquest anyway, because they are
too busy fighting mobs, which is really what this game is all about.

I know, I know.  You are going to come back and tell me that *I* should
research the subject and that the economy in EQ is a model economy and that
people don't practice tradeskills because they just don't wanna.  Or
whatever.  That is why this debate is futile.

The fact is.  If items do not deteriorate, then the market becomes saturated
with them, demand for them diminishes and the economy becomes stagnant.
That's a fact.  It's a fact in real life and it's a fact on an EverQuest
Server.

Best Regards
