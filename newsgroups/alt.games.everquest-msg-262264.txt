I have been taking my toons to Overthere.  At 20, everything was dark blue 
to red between the PoK book and the ocean.  At 25 most are lite blue or 
green, but there are still quite a few dark blues.  When I first went there 
last month, loot was great.  I averaged over a P per kill, plus beaks, 
teeth, gems and words.  Now it seems the loot is less, around 5G but the 
rest is still good.
If you are a good race you can not go into the city, or even stay at the 
book when healing-up as you will be KOS.  I don't recommend doing much 
trading there anyway cause I can get better value per item by going to POK.
Overall, I like the zone.  My NEC, MNK and WAR have or still are in this 
area.  Just remember to con everything and don't go too far to the south I 
think as the levels are higher.
