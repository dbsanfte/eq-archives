LOL, I died several times on that one too.  Very hard to do at the level 
you can get the quest.  Seems easy until you go to that damnable island 
crawling with undead.  And was impossible until I got a map, didn't even 
know about half the locations until I did that tour.  Guess they named the 
quest right.
