I also use AT&T at home, you might want to check for a virus that attaches
to your winsock.dll file.  I had no problems with my connection, then all
the sudden I was bouncing on every zone and had very bad lag.  I downloaded
a virus scanner (there is only one that detects the virus and think it is
called AVX).  I ran the virus scanner and poof, no more problems.  Might be
worth a shot :).
