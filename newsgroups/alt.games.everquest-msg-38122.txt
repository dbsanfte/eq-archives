Why do I care? Because, I am one of those people that does not like to buy an item. I
take a personal pride in the fact that the majority of the items my character
possesses was quest, hunted, or made by me. I would camp an area for extended amount
of time just to get that 1 item I wish to possess for that character. Heck, I started
tailoring skill from a level of 12 to get to 168 to have a chance to make a fleeted
quiver rather then buy one.

I do not have two accounts. I do have a couple other characters but I would not want
set them in a zone that no one goes to to get an item that is for another one of my
high level characters. TLC henders my chances at getting items that would be good for
my character when I want to follow my normal method of getting all that I have myself.
TLC forces me to play the game the way that I do not want to play it. It forces me to
sit in East Commons trying to auction for things. I do not like that game. I want to
get the things myself.

It is kind of hypocritical to say that no one has a right to something. Then say
except for low level players. High level players do not have a right for an item. Low
level players do not have a right for an item. The person that gets there first has
their chance to get the item. The person that gets there later has to wait. It is
called standing in line. We do it every day. We do it at the grocery store. We do it
at the amusement park. It is something that we were supposed to learn when we were in
kindigarden. If a low level player is in a camp and a high level player comes along
and kills something that the low level player was fighting, that is KSing. Call in a
GM or Guide. TLC does not correct or stop this.

And this is absolutely wrong and hypocritical.

Actually, contrary to what you heard, EverQuest is ment to be a GAME. And like all
games, it is ment to be played for fun. Some people have fun getting themselves
involved in the economic factors of the game. Some people have fun getting themselves
involved in the epic and brave battles. Who are you or anyone else to be the person to
say that someone else is not allowed to have fun the way they like to have fun.

The problem that everyone has with farming, the only problem that everyone has, is the
in ability to do something they want to at the exact time they want to. If that farm
was there and you never came around, you would not even know it. But the fact that
that farmer got to some place before someone else upsets other people. Well, here is a
note on life, everyone has to wait sometime or another.

Verant creates zones for people to go to and explore. People do not explore them. Then
some people get upset because others can explore as a single person when they cannot
move past the zone in without a group. Verant does not create a zone to make farmers
happy. But Verant should not also create a zone to keep people from exploring or
having fun doing what they like. To each his own.
