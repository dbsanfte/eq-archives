Sure is:

Most of the kunark stuff is for iksar quests.

There are many things that have no known use.
Which I wonder why Verant put these things in?
Just to annoy foragers? Just to take up inventory space
and waste the time of the player looking for a use that
is not there?

If its for future quests or tradskills then why put them in now?
Wait until the quest or trade item is in game first.

I can at least understand some of the old world special forage
items can be sold for a gold or so, but some things are no drop
or can't be sold to a vendor, so the only option is to drop
or destroy them. Stupid.
