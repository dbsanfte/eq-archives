My main tank pally friend who is now super uber in a big guild used to do this
too.  I never let it bother me, and I didn't think he was *spoiled*.  He wanted
to move fast, and hated waiting around for me to med.  And actually, although I
never thought he *needed* it, if it made him happy I figure "more power to
him".  
Here's what DID piss me off:  I was in a pickup LDON group once sitting in the
adventurer camp in BB and got a tell from the GL:  "Could you please give 2
dots to that HL cleric over there?  She said she'd cast group virtue on us".  I
had already cast temp on the MT.
I responded: "Shouldn't that be a *group* expense?"
He responded:  "Well, it'll save you mana in the long run".
I responded: "Sorry, I only have one dot left.  I bet she'll take your plat if
you offer".
He responded: "I can't afford it".  
Sigh.
