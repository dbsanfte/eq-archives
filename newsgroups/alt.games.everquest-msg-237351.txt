Because of the invis'ing I didn't even bother to bring my Pet up for the
final fight (although in retrospect I probaby should have for the extra DPS
in that room. I will next time.

I was pretty aggressive with my malos, slows DoTs and nukes (well, Tears of
Saryn, a kind of rolling nuke rain), and I never once gained aggro even
though I was casting Malos on the pull as they were still approaching. Pally
tank we had was pretty good and managed to keep aggro the entire time
(athough he screwed up on one attempt by hitting the wrong hotkey for his
loh and died in an unusual CH/patch vaccuum during the final boss fight.
Party wiped, NEXT)!

By the way, if it hasn't already been mentioned, experience here is
incredible, something like 2-3% AA per kill. I gained almost 2 AAs last
night in this one session and the Time guys are telling me that this place
is comparable to the PoF exp grinds they usually do, making it one of the
best places in the game for pure exp grinding.
