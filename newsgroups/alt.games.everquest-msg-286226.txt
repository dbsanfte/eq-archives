Well I found out my home city had been changed to Cresent Reach. This
happened while I was no longer playing EQ (took a 2 year break). As of
yet I have not found the  Wayfarer nor have I received any messages
hinting at what to do. I did find the NPC in Mountains of Rathe and
even he wouldn't talk to me but suggested I go talk to some other NPC.
I thought the Mountains of Rathe NPC assisted everyone regardless of
faction status. All very frustrating. I have the LDON expansion now
but can't do them cause of this stupid adventures stone BS.

Hopefully this will get resolved soon. I want to explore and see the
new zones and not just XP. I heard there were some good easy soloable
quests I can do bu travel is a problem if I can't use the Magnus's.

Zebuxoruk.
