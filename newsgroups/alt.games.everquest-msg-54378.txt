Oops I was using the new luclin patcher from test with the Luclin
graphic ... hmmm it lets you get on the regular server too.. but it
repatches those files above after you patch them with regular patcher
so I guess I can't use it still now = ( 

Its kinda cool because it patches optional, kunar, velious, and
regular all at once then auto goes to the game instead of having to
hit a button.

Basically I patched up on test server and then run 

_estEverQuest.exe

and go to advanced and put regular servers in there. Been using it in
regular EQ for 3 days or so.
