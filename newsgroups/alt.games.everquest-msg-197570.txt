Getting my 6 tries done took 7 hours in the evening and another two
hours in the morning. Also note that I was extremely lucky in getting
through so soon (many of my guildies tried dozens, even hundreds of
times), we came within a hair of failing on my 6th try, and that I am
one of the 'desirable' trial classes.
