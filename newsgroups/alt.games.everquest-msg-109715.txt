As a hypothesis, you are welcome to it. As far as I know, "survival of 
the fittest" has not been used as a justification for any eradication at 
all. In fact, eradications have always come from the other direction, out 
of fear of the others's capacity and willingness (real or imagined) to 
overtake and erradicate us (us being anybody from the Nazis to Stalin's 
perceived enemies, to the intellectuals in Cambodia). I can't come up of 
any single example in history of an atrocity commited with the excuse 
that the victims were "weak".

Love and Hate do indeed apply, but they aren't laws of nature.
