I agree!


I should add that my most wished for changes in the poison skills would
be...

1. Make the applied poison last for more than one kill.  It could be like a
buff
2. Make the poisons stack ( I could live with em staying unstackable if no.
1 above was true)
    2a. Just had this idea. Allow shamans to stack the posions for you like
their potions!
3. higher drops of the reagents
