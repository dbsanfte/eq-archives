Inflation and deflation are not about prices, but about the change in
the money supply. Norrath has been in massive inflation since day one
as the actual amount of coin available to its market economy increases
with practically every kill. What causes price decreases in EverQuest
is not deflation, but obsolescence. When the SSOY was the height of
tech, they could easily go for 1.2 kplat. As better items came into
easy availability, the price dropped.

OTOH, as money supply has increased, no easy alternative for the FBSS
has appeared and the price has risen steadily from 2k to 5-6 kplat, in
line with the price increase expected during inflationary periods.
