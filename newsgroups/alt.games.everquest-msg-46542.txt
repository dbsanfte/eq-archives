Skyfire what?!?
Every damn critter in Skyfire have nearly twice the hitpoints of
comparable level mob and hits about 30% harder.

Skyfire is absolutely shitty place for a group like that.  Take that
group to the Hole (Velk is good but just too damn full of idiots these
days).  The Hole is nearly empty, great exp and a solid challenge.
