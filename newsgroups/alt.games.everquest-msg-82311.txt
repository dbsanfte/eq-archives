I use LOC a LOT to find my way around Norrath. Wanna find someone for 
selling/buying/grouping/porting, get a lot, since tracking are not reliable.
Wanna find a place from a map, get the loc from the map and find it. 
Easiest way to get to a place.


My log file was 47 mb (hehe, trimmed it down now), and 4 mb of it was 
/loc commands.
