I have a feeling that no GM support is a minor issue vs the size of the 
population. As far as I'm concerned there is minimal-to-no GM support on 
any of the servers I play on, so reputation is as imporant on all of 
them... the only difference being with so many more players on the 
'production servers' I run into the same idiots less often.
