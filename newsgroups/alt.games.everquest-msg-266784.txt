You've missed the point.  Kill Stealing does not have a UNIVERSAL
DEFINITION.   It doesn't mean the same thing everywhere any more than
FAG means the same thing in the USA and the UK.

Using a definition from outside the current game makes as much sense as
an American going to Britain and telling them that their use of FAG is
wrong, it's not cigarette, it's "REAL" meaning is homosexual, because
that what it means in America.
