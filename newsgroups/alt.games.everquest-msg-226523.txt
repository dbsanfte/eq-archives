Would I get yelled at if I said it baffles me that anyone could possibly get
such a bug up their ass about someone getting such a bug up their ass about
something so trifling? Eh, probably.

Basically theyre bundling a relatively high-demand item with a relatively
low-demand item, to boost said low-demand item's sales artificially. But
heck, thats marketing for you. They know that EQ fanbois that *need* an EQ2
beta spot will spend the money, so why not? Sleazy? Well, depends on how you
look at it. Theyre not being deceptive, as was mentioned.

But if people really have a problem with their business practices, they know
how to be heard. Stop giving them your money! But people rarely take that
advice.
