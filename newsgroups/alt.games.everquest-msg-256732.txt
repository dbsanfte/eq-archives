Clicky on this is Skin like Steel, which is, at my level, a 9 AC 100 hp 
buff, useless compared to Virtue which I can get readily almost any time 
in POK.

But in addition to being a buff to HP, it also fills up the HP it adds. 
  Cast it again and its a 100 HP heal.

Cast time on it is 8.5 seconds, self buffed I have around 2100 HP, so 
thats 21 casts to full hp from zero, except that my HP regen is normally 
about 30 hp per tic standing (70 tics to full HP), so its less than that.

What I can't figure as easily is that if I sit I get more than that 30 
hp per tic, and as I sit longer I get more and more HP per tic. 
Further, up till 70% I can BW, which gives me roughly 40 hp per, or 
perhaps 20 hp per tic boost in heal rate.

At some point I need to do an actual test run, from say 20% hp each 
time, to see what gets me to full hp faster, chain SlS standing or chain 
BW sitting.

My current impression is that the chain SlS is actually faster, and in 
particular it allows me to heal between each pull if I want, instead of 
waiting thru several kills in order to get my HP well down because this 
is more efficient.  It also lets me avoid sit aggro, and lets me refresh 
my Fungal Regrowth without breaking my heal rate by interrupting a 
continuous sit.

BUT, it means I don't have Virtue, which takes away a very large cushion 
and subtracts some of my AC as well.
