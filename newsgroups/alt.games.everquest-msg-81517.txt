I understand you can get pumice stones from vendors (I think for a few
platinum) and that they're used to cancel magic (e.g., you can remove
a damage shield a mob casts on itself or if a mob roots you, you can
cancel the root).  How do you use it?  Do you right-click on it or how
do you activate it?  Can you put it in your inventory or does it have
to be in your secondary slot?  Does it have unlimited charges or do
you have to use a new stone for each time you cancel magic?   Are
there any spells it WON'T work on?

Thanks in advance,
