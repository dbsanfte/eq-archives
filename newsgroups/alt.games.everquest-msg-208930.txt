    The item logs only, at this time, track trades and looting. If I move
the bags around in my bank account, the system won't know. I'd guess that
moving plat to the shared slot will be similar to moving bags around in the
bank - no logs will be made of it. Heck, unless something's changed recently
they didn't even log transactions with NPC vendors. A common scammer
technique to throw off the audit trail on a stolen item was to sell it to a
vendor with one character, then purchase it with a second character. Items
bought from a vendor were (are?) assigned new item ID numbers, making it
impossible to connect the stolen item with the new item except through
cimcumstantial evidence.
