OHHHH this is why its not setting off alarms I guess. I have not been
on for a few days and patched some soundbank files today..  then can't
get on the login server. That guy said his kid's account was on
yesterday and gets in.
So anyone who was on yesterday is going "Wtf they are nutty.. i get on
fine!"

I'm going to try that "complete file check" button.

Bleh.. nope did not work.
