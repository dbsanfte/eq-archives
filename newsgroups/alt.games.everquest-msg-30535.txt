Heh, well it's just newsgroup crap that's the same everywhere, Jackal.  I
think your post is O.K. and shant spam you.  Those who do are the dorks.
(*sigh* /emote braces for the flames on his post because of that)

Anyway, newsgroups (ngs) have always been filled with flamers and trolls.
No use trying to claim that "your" newsgroup is immune because that's what
they live for.  Here's what I propose: post good comments and real replies
in spite of their efforts.  Eventually, the tide will turn.  (I've actually
seen it done on an NFL newsgroup).

So kudos, keep that chin up, and you've got a good plan for hotkeying that.
On Druzzil it's the same as your post.  --stage right on your way out, med
left--.

Later,

-Grim
