Go to eqtraders.com/quests/quests.htm and look up the quest.  While you 
are there, look at the progressive tailoring quest too.

Specifically, you probably need to turn in the 'scraps' instead.  I just 
looked at the quests page.  You need your handwraps to make your claws.
You won't get your cloak back until you give him claws.  Do you still 
have the pattern you got from Poren?  If not give him your slate again, 
you can prob get another.  The good news is if you can get this done 
right away, it may not be too late.  The bad news is, you may not get 
your claws from Poren and your cloak after you turn in your claws.  If 
you don't get your stuff from Poren, then you have 2 choices: delete and 
start a new character or petition for a GM to give you your cloak.  By 
far the least frustrating way is to start a new character.

The Vahshir are sometimes a frustrating class to play.  There are good 
rewards tho.  If you don't want to do tailoring, consider playing 
another class.  Rogues are bakers, Bards are Potters, Warriors are 
Smiths (that one makes some sense I guess), Shaman are brewers.  I 
played a Bard for while and was really blown away by the good stuff they 
make for thier quests.  The progressive pottery quest can be done by any 
class Vahshir and you get weight reduction jars for each step, granted 
bard has advantage because of thier cloak with mods but pottery isn't 
that difficult to advance to high enough to get the first jar at least.

Good luck and keep working on them VahShir quests, not enough people 
doing them.
