No. It makes -some- kinds of comparison meaningless, but some kinds are 
quite valid.

Lineage sports 2.1 million 'monthly access accounts' as well as up to an 
estimated *additional* 2 millon players accessing via internet cafe's 
etc. I beleive this information is perfectly applicable when getting a 
sense of the scale of the game and its playerbase, as well as watching 
growth trends etc within the mmog.

Furthermore, even WoW is already running double what EQ1 peaked at, and 
has picked up 6 or 7 times as many players as EQ2 has in the same time 
frame. More specifically: it too dwarfs EQ, and is rapidly approaching 
Lineage scale numbers)
