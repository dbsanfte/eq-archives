Actually the original statement about PoJ trials is quite true.  I've played
several adventures and even the "normal" difficulty ones are hard without
the right balance.  We picked an assassinate scenario with a ranger, bard,
cleric, mage, and chanter as the group.  We were fine killing the mobs, but
when we got to the named, his nuke destroyed us all one by one and the
cleric couldn't keep the ranger or bard alive long enough for aggro control
or dps to pick up.  The idea behind LDoN was customized adventures to your
level, but i'm not sure the quest giver knows your classes in the group or
if it does then their are some major flaws.  Some might say that strategy
would have helped us kill this guy but we only had 10 minutes when we found
him so it was a rush to try and kill.  Alas failure but we can try again.
The other sad thing is that if we had used a pure tank....sk, pal, war, we
probably could have won....maybe...who knows though.
