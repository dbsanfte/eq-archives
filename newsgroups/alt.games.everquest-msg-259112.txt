They weren't that bad until the "retuned" from 42 to 54 by turning them
into 5k/round hitters with rampage. They'd still be kind of fun if they
didn't hit stupidly hard.

Oh no, there's another one after Uqua? Or you mean the 2 cases there?
Actually that part of the Uqua event isn't so bad for our guild at
least.

This is similar to how we do the Barxt event. We still have arguments
about whether we need to let the second wave of adds spawn but the two
times we tried powering through fast enough to stop the second wave from
spawning resulted in wipes so we basically repeat our first on the fly
strategy that worked the first time we got as far as Barxt, because
there isn't any hints generated in the event emotes as to whether having
both waves spawn was significant or not. So we don't know if it was
important for both waves to spawn, we just know we win when they do.
