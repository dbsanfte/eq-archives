Well, why can't you respond with a valid comment instead of attacking
someone you don't even know.
Explain to me how I'm a "Fuggin' disgrace to humanity",give me a valid
logical reason how you came to that conclusion.
You must know me pretty well, because 1 comment on usenet isn't enough
for me to guess some ones worth. But someone responding with cut downs
and vulgarity is very child like in nature.
And yes, I was going to quit EQ anyway, for the past year the game has
gone down the tubes as far as I'm concerned. Bad service, unreliable
servers, Bah. I haven't really played in 5 months, now stupid
penalties because I can't play the way I want to.
But still I'll be waiting for your response on how I'm a "fuggin'
disgrace to humanity", since you don't know me it should be good.
Come on, I don't now Dark Tyger from atom, but I wouldn't call him a
waste of humankind. He does get a little power hungry here every now
and then and he really goes off on people that make fun of his name.
But I would never call him a waste, I don't know him.
But go ahead and explain yourself and your deducting.
