Both.  Well, it's not like she refuses to get near me.  She claims she can 
taste it on me like a non-smoker can taste cigarettes, and that it's 
similarly repulsive.  I've even noticed myself that some of my older 
clothes smell funny to me now.  I think the best one was when I had a sushi 
dinner and she tasted it on me a week later when I picked her up from the 
airport :P
