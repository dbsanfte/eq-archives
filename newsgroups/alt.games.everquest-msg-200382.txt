I attended a King raid with another guild a few weeks ago and was the 2nd 
chanter there.  The first was the raid leader and level 60 ( I think ).  We 
got to the Library and the raid leader had to log.

Here I am, with a guild that isn't mine, and we're 1 room between us and 
the King and I'm the only chanter.  What do I do ....

.... well, the only thing that a chanter normally does in this situation - 
I took the raid over even though only a couple people knew me =)

We rushed the room after the library ( could have pacified, but the Library 
was going to pop soon ), and wiped the mobs out in that room and headed 
into the passage.  I had talked to the RL and her strat was going to be 
pacify and rush the King.  As a ( then ) level 57 and only enchanter on the 
raid, I decided to try the strat I plan on using for our guild - pacify and 
single the King to the corner in the hallway.

I bind-sighted a rogue, he snuck to the room, I changed my BS to a Sarnak 
on the north sode of the room and pacified all 8 guards, then told the 
highest level pally to pull the King.

King comes running to the hall with one friend.  I'm not sure If I missed a 
pacify or the time ran out on it.  They get the King in the corner and 
start whaling on him while I keep the add locked.  King is almost dead and 
gates.

I told a few specific people to camp while the rest of them start killing 
the sarnak I had locked down.  Running down the ramp, I see the Overking 
pretty close to the door, so I tash him and he comes running to the hall 
again.  The ones I told to camp cancel and the MT pulls Overking to the 
corner and finish him along with a roamer spawn.  Cleric loots, 3 rezzes, I 
lock down another add, and we evac.

It was a blast =)  When the other chanter said she was logging, I thought 
it was over.  I couldn't imagine me locking down the whole King room while 
they killed him and wasn't sure the pacify / single-pull strategy would 
work.  Luckily for all of us it did work.  One bad add could have 
potentially aggroed the Queen room on us if the chain were set up right, 
but we got lucky I guess.

All in all, it was fun, a cleric got her scroll, and I made a few friends 
that will be willing to help us on our upcoming Chardok raid.  That's a 
good night.
