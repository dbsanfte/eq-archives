I have to agree. Nothing in the patch message denotes a good reason to
bring the servers down this week, with a patch last week, and the large
stonebrunt patch on the horizon (hopefully)

Times like this you have to wonder what they *haven't* told you.

Didn't they muck around with the faction last patch, leading to the loss
of 'maxed out' messages?
Didn't they mention messing around with pet agro following the Kael
giant un-charmability temp fix?
Lots of north ToV items have been revealed recently, have they nerfed
more of them?

Be afraid, be very afraid...
