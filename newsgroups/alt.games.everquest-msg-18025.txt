The best answer I ever heard to this question was given here, back when
*I* was bitching about twinks. (From memory, so not exact.)
We all hated it when we started out, and we all started doing it when we
could.
It's really just jealousy, and it's a natural reaction. I was very
jealous. I was working my ass off trying to makea  couple levels using
rusty weapons and tattered leather armor when ubertwinks with Ry Gorr and
Lammys went sailing by soloing stuff ten levels above them.
  Hang in there. The day will come when you can afford to start a new
character that you really want to play and outfit him decently to not have
to struggle so much through those awkward "bat and bug bashing" levels.
