Um, HEF is Half Elf, not High Elf (HIE).  Half Elven smiths (and there
were a number of Half Elf Paladin Mastersmiths around) were shafted
when they came out with the racial stuff.  Demonstrating a very special
brand of cluelessness they made many of the cultural armors wearable
by Half Elves as "compensation", how in hell what you can wear (i.e.
yet another reward for twinkers) was supposed to compensate for what
you cannot make (i.e. screwing tradeskillers) was never explained.
