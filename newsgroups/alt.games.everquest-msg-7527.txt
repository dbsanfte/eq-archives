I'm telling you. We were killing gouls and dry bones and tormented dead and
whatnot. I will admit that it wasn't four hours of PURE hunting. But I was
there for four hours, and didn't fool around much. I hate Crushbone, it is
so packed with people. I will go check it out though, before I take the boat
to Antonica. Thank you.
