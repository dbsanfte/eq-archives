Oh I agree whole heartidly about necros!  They in and of themselves
are
groups!  The main problem with necros is that we are shy and indendant
of
most group situations.  We are not well known by about 80 percent of
the
other players in EQ and as a result, we are not fully understood.

Its tuff, because most of our power comes from root/dot, pet/DOT,
Kite/Dot/Pet,
Kite/Dot, reverse kite/Dot/pet ...  we are not a GROUP orientated
class.

On the other hand, we can offer nice benefits to the group:

We have a group HoT (Heal over Time) spell; 1k+ in 58 secs I believe.

We can mana tap a spell casting mob and add 300 mana points to the
pools of group spell casters.  (Note: I hate when people are always
asking me to TWITCH them.  It is very ineficient and only provides 60
mana points to one target.  Mind Wrack adds 300 to ALL party members
while decreasing the mana of the target mob!)

Necros can pull, yes I said it, necros can pull.  Personally, they are
the best "out door" pullers as they bring the mobs to kill area
already 5 - 10 percent damaged (due to dots and dooming line of
spells).

Necros can summon corpses and rez (not really important in LDON, but
have you ever fallen into the Hole?!?).

Necro 65 pet, a lvl 60 life tapping, self DSing Warrior.  To bad its
hit points are only a slight bit over 4k.  If the mob is slowed, then
I have an easy time keeping pet alive, but should shackle fail, and
the mob is 60+, time to Feign Death and start all over again!

I do alot of fighting in Veksar with 65 Necro.  I take on the lvl 63
Highborn Commanders and the Named Frogs back near the sewers.  These
are two of the highest lvl mobs in that zone, and they are at times a
pain in the Ass to take on solo!  Highborns and Frogs both undead,
resist slows often.  The only reason I am able to solo them with
consistancy, is because I can feign death and life tap DOT.  Shammans
can solo yes, but a Shammy can't FD.  Something goes wrong, you had
better hope to gate ... or you are now dead!

I guess if a chanter got down deep into Veksar, she would be able to
solo ... maybe.  I think the life tapping and the DFing places the
necro into a class of our own.
