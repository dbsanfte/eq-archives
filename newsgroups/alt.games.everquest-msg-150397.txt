The topic is "what defines bad class play"

That isn't specific to group or raid play, its generic.

I've even gone to the trouble of tracing back up the line for you,
and can't find the point at which you said "in a single group
environment..."

Its possible that you did say that, attempting to narrow the
focus of the thread or this subportion, mind you.  But I
can't find it.  Nothing I see working back is specific to
raid versus group.

I will admit that the whole thread is widely biased against
solo bad play, hardly anyone has complained about some
class's failures in that department.
