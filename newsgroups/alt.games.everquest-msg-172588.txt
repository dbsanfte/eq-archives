I hardly intend or even desire to attempt any mustering.

That's right. It's a fad. Fad implies shallow and lacking in merit
upon close inspection. Keep fads out of my RP experience. Take them to
Sims Online where they belong.

"Willy nilly"? The point was irrelevant. It was a RL example. It
doesn't apply to the EQ experience.

It's not necessarily easier to type, unless you are referring to the
single instance of a double-consonant, which is minor to the point of
being a non-factor.

Hmm. Interesting. I never knew that. Curious - how did he know people
typed too fast if he hadn't designed the keyboard yet? I never
considered that the qwerty layout was not the first widely-accepted
version.

Well, I never would have thought it to be any easier. It isn't for me,
but hey, as a programmer, I still mix up FORM and FROM on a daily
basis, and I'd bet most never have any trouble with it.  :)

Btw, thanks for your own contribution to this "endless rant".
