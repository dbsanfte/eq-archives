My group had an enchanter last night. I was primary heal. The monk
decides that since we have an enchanter, we can handle anything and is
consistently pulling 2 and 3 at a time. Both the enchanter and I are
at low mana due to this and ask him to limit the adds - his reasoning
includes the aforementioned 'enchanters fix everything' and the little
gem 'good group = low mana'. He has already pulled at 2 bubbles of
health (due to me delaying heals so I could med up in the hopes that
he'd have the sense to wait) so now I state bluntly that when his adds
DO get out of hand, I'll be saving the enchanter, not him. It took a
while, but we finally got him to veer more towards pulls of one :)
