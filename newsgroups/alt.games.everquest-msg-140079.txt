30 ticks is like 3 minutes, right?  Since they fixed the DoT nerf, I
can see this, ES arms/Thrug Bracer/SS Bracelet, and a Wardens Symbol
of Tunare making druids pretty freakin powerful.

Wolf up.  Pull with Epic.  Root with Symbol.  Winged Death + ES Arms.
Wash.  Rinse.  Repeat.

Hell, with just the ES Arms and the Wardens Symbol, I can take down
the Allizesaur in OOT fairly trivially (lag BAD), and he has like 15k
hitpoints.  With my epic, it'd be a total breeze.
