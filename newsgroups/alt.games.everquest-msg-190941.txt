I think I have a theory why it happens that sometimes when it comes
out even you can add one:

When I was PL'ing my first 'bot, my mage was 58.  I assumed that the
way you wrote it was correct, and I'd need the 'bot to get to 39  to
group with me:  IE

38 * 1.5 is 57
39 * 1.5 is 58.5 (rounded up is 59)

Now, at 38, the cleric turned Cyan to my 58 mage.
and got experience grouped.

This, combined with the fact that every other
formula I'd ever seen for EQ rounded down led
me to look at it the other way.

58/3 is 19.33.  19.33*2 is 38.66, rounded down
is 38.  So a 38 is cyan (groupable).  THis fit
with my experience.

Now, at 38 this guy was still green to my buddy
(59 ranger) and other friend (60 Druid) which
fits both formulas

At 39 he was cyan to the ranger, green to the
druid (again fits both formulas).  At 40 he was
cyan to all of us.

This lead me to believe they calculate cyan (and
lowest groupability) as 2/3rds character level
rounded down.  The other formula only fails when
the highest character's level is some multiple of
3 + 1.
