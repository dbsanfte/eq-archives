No, they have utility that others do better. That aside, I was
responding only to their comparisons to poor, poor monks, but if you
want to go further, I surely can. But just to refresh your memory:

Monks are #2 melee dps with a big lead on #3, rangers are #4 at best
and that barely ahead of those below them.
Monks have an unresistable lull indoors and outdoors, rangers were
told unresistable harmony outdoors was too powerful and had it nerfed
Monks have FD to split what can't be lulled, rangers have real death
then the real pullers take over.
Monks have two invuln discs. Rangers have one.
Monks have melee enhancing discs. Rangers have zero.
Monks take damage as well or better than rangers.

What do rangers have to make up for all this? Snare, track, and invis?
Ability to do suboptimal damage from outside melee range other than
once an hour? Pred, SoT, and CoR? You'd have to be a retard to think
they compare.

Take a group of five people, all the basics are set. A ranger and a
monk are looking for a group. Which do you take? Everyone takes the
monk. And why shouldn't they? For all their bellyaching about the
mitigation nerf, monks are still in the "have" category.

Hell let's see if you'd take a ranger over *any* class.

Bard? Rather have the bard, for the pulling ability alone. The only
time I'd ever take ranger over bard is if I already *had* a bard.
Beastlord? Grossly superior dps, mana regen? Gimme the BL.
Cleric? You'd take the ranger for normal LDoNs and other trivial stuff
just to get it over with faster, otherwise cleric.
Druid? Druid every time. The druid can do nearly everything the ranger
can and far more.
Enchanter? Gee, I wonder....
Magician? Better dps, offtank ability. Take the mage.
Necro? *Much* better dps, snare, ghetto mez, and other stuff. Take the
necro.
Paladin? Better heals, tanking, ghetto rez.. gimme paladin
Rogue? The best melee dpser, best CR, best scout (which used to be
rangers definition)? No brainer.
Shaman? They hold aggro and tank as well or better than rangers mainly
because they bring their own slow. Gimme the shaman, unless I already
have one.
Shadowknight? Nearly equal dps, tank ability, snare, pet pulling... SK
every time.
Warrior? Another tank who's melee dps is only a smidgeon below the
ranger's. Gimme the warrior.
Wizard? Better burst dps and again a snare along with travelling
niceties. Gimme the wizard.

So when do you take the ranger? When you're up against trivial
opposition, like normal LDoNs. When for some bizarre reason you can't
find a druid, necro, shadowknight, bard, or wizard to snare. When you
want someone to do out of melee range dps and there's no casters
available.

I liked when Ashlanne posted a "fun" thread in all the class forums a
little while ago. Most forums just had fun with it, the ranger forum
attacked the thread as a slap in the face (no dev has responded to a
ranger thread in many months now, unlike most other classes) to the
point it was locked. Then there was the bitter joking about the new AA
ranger are getting with OoW. Ooh, sure rangers are a bit down on
themselves, we'll give them, I KNOW, DOUBLE FORAGE! That oughtta quiet
them down....

Rangers are *pissed off*. Other classes have been in that position
from time to time so its not anything new. Rogues in original EQ.
Enchanters in Velious. Warriors in PoP. Rangers today.

And it is especially galling to see so much being farmed out to
Berserkers.


>Travelling.
>Ask the Cleric moving to Barindu about SoE and Camo.

No one invites the ranger for their invis.


>Want to meet some friends in Ssra basement with a 
>Berserker? - Have fun crossing Mons Letalis without

Because soe is so hard to come by? No one invites the ranger for lev.


>t,take the risk of invis dropping or let the
>group pull the way free in Ssra

So is the ranger going to solo everything down there? So what if the
ranger can get there alone, everyone else needs to too and most caster
classes can invis.


>What about Tracking?

Oh you mean that thing druids can do better now? That thing that is
useless in later zones because so much is untrackable? That thing that
is completely trivialized by SEQ and MQ?


>Playing mostly my Cleric lately,I really miss it in Ldon,and
>even see group members asking to get a Ranger for Tracking.

I can't remember the last time someone actually cared about named in
LDoNs.


>Grouped with the "Holy Trinity",no Druid,no Shammy?
>Regrowth becomes valuable.

Regrowth is virtually useless. That is a kunark era druid spell.
You're against mobs that hit for high triple digits or over 1k, where
do you think 15 more hp per 6 seconds is going to matter? There isn't
even any downtime to reduce anymore. I can't remember the last time I
memmed regrowth.

>No Mage,no Druid in group? - Damageshields.

Yeah that 24 damage is going to turn the tides. Woo we're #4 in damage
shields, that oughtta get us some groups!

>
>Pulling?

Why bother? Monks and bards are infinitely better. Pet classes are
better.

And monks, bards, pet classes all make better pullers. Not to mention
Harmony is capped and resistable.

If the monk has their weapons from GoD (Demerix etc)? Of course they
do. Rogues do more with pre-time weapons; in fact GoD equipped rogues
outdps rangers who are *using* TS. All the dps casters do plenty more
while they have mana, especially if they don't have to throttle too
much. Druids do more. SK and warriors can do more if they've gotten
their offensive aa, though usually they're very slightly less. Do we
need to have our GoD weapon just to catch up to other classes pre-GoD?


>Last MM Raid I  was on,I remember when 6 Rangers turned on TS

So we are to depend on two minutes of worthwhile dps every hour?


>Problem lies not in Rangers underpowered

That's exactly where the problem lies. When your class has no unique
ability to bring to a group, does nothing someone else can't do better
and is inferior in its stated role (dps) compared to classes which
aren't even in that role, then there's a problem.
