Well, as I see it there are two issue:

One) DAoC is very similar to EQ, but has better a better magic system.  If you
like EQ then realize DAoC isn't much different and has less content at this
time.

Two) DAoC is very similar to EQ, so you could switch without a lot of trouble. 
If your friends are important to you then it won't be a big shock to change.

DAoC has one major advantage, it isn't run by the lamefucks at Verant.
