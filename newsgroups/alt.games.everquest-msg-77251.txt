You *can* solo them from about 29 (when you get your new spells) or if
you have lots of good equipment probably now. I am keeping all 3 spawns
under control at level 30 and working through my first mini hell. The
gobos are mostly blue (29) with some even (30). You can single pull them
and set the cycle up so that you have just the right med time between
spawns. Dont let them hit you, they rip through my armour (admittidly
weak) for 60 easy. If you get a bunch of resists you can always run to
the Dwarf guard hut. You will *never* die here. Xp is good and the drops
net you about 100pp from ever 20 goblins.

Having said all that it is a contested camp and as dull as hell.

HTH,

Jim
