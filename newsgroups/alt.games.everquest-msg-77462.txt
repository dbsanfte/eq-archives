Both important, gameplay slightly more so, but:
In the case of EQ: graphics, slightly more so, for the suspension of
disbelief factor. Gameplay is largely static in EQ, a bit less so for magic
users.
You kill anything that cons at least blue, over and over and over. The
quests are OK but involve lots of tedious running around, and often more
killing of stuff, and are often unrewarding (like the halas elizir quest;
you have run across the dangerous tundra, to get to megan, by the time it is
safer to do so the exp and reward is tiny). No quests that alllow you to
reach previously unreachable areas, such as a dungeon area needing a no drop
key, with a door that zones you back to the exit if you try to go through.
In the dungeons you mostly walk around killing stuff. No real roleplaying
that I can see such as puzzle solving, object finding, or skills required,
such as Lara style leaping, and so on. Perhaps these things can only be
implemented in a single player game. But EQ gameplay is made by the
interaction of people, grouping, guilds, just chatting, while waiting for
spawns, buying lvl 50 stuff at lvl 30, getting advice and so on.. Remove
that aspect and what is left of the gameplay?
Just a side note: Dont have it yet, but does SoL introduce any major
gameplay advances, (other than alternate skill advance for plus lvl 50) or
did they concentrate on improving the graphics only?
