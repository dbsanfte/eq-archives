Yes indeed!  Recently rez'd a 2 1/2 year old Necro who had been sitting at
level 24 for about 2 years.  The other day while passing through DL on my
way to BW (necro is 54 now) I was one of TWO people in DL!  Granted it was
around 8am on a weekday but I can remember 2 years ago when there would have
been at least 30 players in DL any morning of the week.  That same evening
again passed through and was one of 19 people there.  Gone are the days of
90 to 100 players in DL on a weekday evening.

Just conjecture go follow......
I think they have gotten the "hint"!  Deliberatly reduce the number of
players on EQ so as to get more EQ2 customers when it launches.  As someone
in an eairler post suggested "the bottom line" is profit and customers are
expendable.  Say for instance SOE charges $14.99/month for EQ2 vers
$12.99/month for EQ.  The number of subscribers to generate $1,000,000 in
revinue drops from 76782 down to 66711!  Thats over 10000 less subscribers
to bring in one million.  Less customers for same income means more profit!
Makes sense... fewer servers, less customer support (one instead of two
people) etc...  Why else make EQ2 a totally seperate non-compatable game or
at the least allow character/s to be ported over to the new game?  Hard to
imagine why someone like SOE couldn't come up with a way to do that
espically if the main point of a new game is enhanced graphics!   Instead
sell a whole new set of disks and expansions to both a segment of current
customer base and thoes yet untapped for instant mega cash flow at a reduced
future cost to boot.  From a marketing stand point that makes sense.  We are
after all precieved by Wall Street as a very "plastic, thorow-away" society
concerned more with glitter than with substance, so a huge company like SOE
will play to what its marketing division precives will generate the most
rapid profits in a given span of time.  Detroit, as one example, has been
doing it for years with great success.  Put different mirrors on a car,
introduce a new paint color and maybe new hub caps, and of course, advertise
it with a couple sexy young suductively clad woman and la la... a new modle
year "everyone" has to have!  Its just the world we live in.

I think the success EQ had in its first couple of years spelled its doom.
That sucess drew the attention of a huge corp. which gobbled it up for one
reason and one reason only.  Big business is big greed so it stands to
reason EQ is in its final days just waiting for EQ2 to launch before it
evaporates into our collective memories.  I'll be very supprised if it lasts
more than a year after the lauch of EQ2.  So heres the delema then...  does
one rush out to be one of the first on EQ2 so as to get a "leg-up" on other
players or do you wait untill EQ is finally taken away for good to bite the
bullet?  I think SOE knows this will be in the minds of most EQ players and
there counting on good old human nature to take effect.

Personally I "survived" before I knew what EQ was and I'll survive after its
gone.  I don't plan on subjecting myself to all the growing pains and
frustrations of leveling new characters again.  I introduced my wife to EQ
so I'll introduce her to other games after EQ's gone but I'll try and resist
EQ2 as long and hard as I can.  As someone else said...  SOE screwed up EQ
so I don't want to be there for their screw-up of EQ2!!!  Oh and don't
forget EQ3 guys.  If EQ2 succeeds you know EQ3 is just around the cornor!!!
