Remember "The Vision"? Say what you want about it, but this game was never 
meant to be one that catered to very short sittings. The not so funny thing 
is, that's what made it the most successful MMORPG of all time. They've 
gone too far in changing it for the less loyal player population, making it 
more like every other half-baked MMORPG out there. Their numbers are fast 
declining, but it's not because of the other games out there or even EQ2.

Hmm...maybe there was a method to their madness after all... ;)

Interesting, I'll give it that.

This is one aspect where the terms "cheapens the gameplay experience" is 
appropriate. A significant aspect of immersive gameplay, travel, has been 
effectively eliminated in favor of more instant gratification.

Additionally, I believe that the loyal player base (those who have been 
playing for years and would generally continue to play) has been by and 
large quite put off by many of the changes meant to cater to the more 
casual (and typically less loyal) player.

Before all the nit-pickers and hair-splitters jump in and once again make 
me want to vomit with your mountain-out-of-a-molehill mentality, I didn't 
say *all*. I do, however, believe it to be the majority. I also didn't say 
that unless you've played for years, you're not a loyal player, but it does 
stand to reason that those old-timers *have* proven it best.

I just never quite understood why so many core philosophies went right out 
the window to satisfy Johnny Come Lately.

I wish more people felt that way.
