Yeah - and I find that if I put a proper comment in the LFG box saying what
I want to do it increases the chance of me getting into a group.

The most amusing thing I often see is when there are three or four people
in PoN sitting at zone shouting LFG every few minutes. I just wonder
why it never occurs to any of them to join up and form their own group.

The other thing I've found in PoN is that sometimes I'll be soloing there
(as a level 60 necro) but LFG as groups are often more fun. And when
someone shouts LFG I'll ask them if they want to join me - at first to
increase damage for my agro-kiting but looking to get more people and
form a traditional tank based group eventually. Most people say no. They'd
rather sit atthe zone shouting LFG waiting for their perect group than do
anything a bit different.

I think LDoN might change this a bit as I think it will encourage a lot more
creativity and thinking about what the classes can actually do that the
boring
PoP static spawn groups ever did - so that's a good thing!
