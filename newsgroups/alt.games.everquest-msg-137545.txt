No it isn't
Your potential customers cannot go elsewhere to buy and you are not making
any outgoings at the time either.
It only feels like you are losing money because RL goes on, EQ stops, dead.

It could be said that semi-permanent traders like you are killing small
business, buying and selling.
Verant owes lost revenue to those that do not own SoL...you been in EC
lately...sub 50 players at the best of times.
I daren't go near EC, I don't think I could handle seeing it empty...

I've yet to try the all night trading, when I log off EQ I'm normally to
tired to sort out my Trading Mule.
Maybe I 'll do it before I go out one night. Wonder how long my free dial up
will hold :ï¿½/
