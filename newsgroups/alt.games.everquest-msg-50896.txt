New software and new hardware always should be tested.  They
should be relatively sure of the network up to their end, but all
the parts after that need to be tested.   They also have to test
the base OS install, the install of the server software, any load
balancing software (or hardware) they have in place, give the
hardware a chance to fail (burn-in time), etc.

The accounts I've seen of their setup indicate that a "server" in
the playerbase's eyes is really a cluster of hardware servers to
them.  There's a base server, and a group of servers that each
run five (more or less) zones.  All of those physical servers have
to be tested as well as the overall game "server."   The only real
way to do that is get a group of players on it and see how it
works.

You're right, and they might see a problem with that after it
goes live.   There's really no way to duplicate load, though,
especially within the game (unless VI has some macro-type
tool to do that.)   That's no reason not to test what they can,
though.
