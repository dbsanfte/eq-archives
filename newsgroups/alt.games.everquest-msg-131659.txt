Valien, well I was glad to read your response because I stopped at
compusa on the way home last night and picked up the GFTi4200.  So far
I'm pretty happy with it.  Turned on more details and for the first
time watched a sunrise in EK, also saw a full moon set. Kinda cool
stuff.  Looks like chain mail really has a 3 dimensional look now.
There is no doubt that the graphics are better than my TNT2 Pro,
whether or not it's a $200 difference is debatable,  but I'm going to
keep it just the same...   ;-)
