Is the duration completely random or what?  Sometimes hide/invis break it
the moment I do either, other times it does nothing while everyone in the
group is screaming "BREAK CHARM!!!"
And no, I don't have auto-attack on while trying to hide.  I've been
silently bitching at myself when I hit hide and I get the "You can't hide
while attacking" spam, but have made mental note to make sure I take attack
off.

WTF?
