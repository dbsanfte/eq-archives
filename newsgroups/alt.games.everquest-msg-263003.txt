The SK should most definitely be snaring if he's tanking.  You're
not tanking if you don't have aggro, Darkness is cheap and high
aggro, it's a complete no-brainer.  Other than that, he should've
been casting for aggro (not sure exactly what their low mana high
aggro spell(s) are outside Darkness line, but even recasting that
would be useful).  As Lance said, puller has a definite leg up on
aggro, tank has to take it from him.  I've encountered several SKs
who didn't seem to know how to take/hold aggro though, if players
can get into their 50s almost totally ignorant of aggro management
basics it's no surprise to hear of one in his 30s.

So you went to a combo worth (roughly) one-half the melee aggro of
your 2hander and he still was taking a while to gain aggro.  Sounds
like he just didn't know what he was doing.  Hopefully he'll get
schooled soon.

At 36, with (in effect) a haste item and a very high aggro (for your
level) weapon, yes, you're something of an aggro monster.  The Paladin
was pulling (headstart from initial agro plus whatever he was using to
pull) and (no doubt) stunning, while using a one-hander that has very
high aggro for his level.

Semi-relevant anecdote:
In my mid-50s I grouped for a while with a monk who had a 2hb with a
high aggro proc, if he got multiple procs early in a fight I had to
literally chain-stun (cast a stun roughly every 3.5 seconds) for 4+
casts to get aggro back, this was after pulling and starting every
fight with at least 2 stuns.  He was disappointed that I was able to
regain aggro, apparently until then he'd never lost aggro using that
toy once he gained it.  Give a Monk the right tool(s) (or wrong, heh)
and he can generate amazing hate despite his lack of intrinsic hate
bonus abilities.
