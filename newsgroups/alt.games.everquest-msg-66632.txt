The short answer is yes.  The long answer is, "as long as you don't even
think of installing SHadows of Luclin, yes.

I run Everquest, with Ruins of Kunark and Scars of Velious, plus all the
recent patches on a system that's not too different than yours.  It takes
longer to load zones than it did a couple of weeks ago, but in-game, there's
no performance loss.  In fact, if anything, there's been an increase since I
went to a TNT2 from a VooDoo2.

My specs:

P233 MMX
96 MB system RAM
nVIDIA TNT2 based video card, 32 MB video RAM
SB Live Value sound card
20 gig 7200 rpm hard drive
