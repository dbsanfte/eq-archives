That's not what I meant, but yes, that's true.  Otherwise
groups would kill solo content.   As well as the level of
the mob, EQ2 uses the group indicator and up/down
indicators for cons.   Group mobs are always tougher
than solo mobs of the same level and therefore give
more XP.

But what I meant was there's a myth that you need to
kill group mobs to get the better drops (from treasure
chests dropped when the mob(s) die.)   That's not
true -- solo and group mobs have (other than some
quest items) the same loot tables, with the drop rate
for group mobs being higher so each player in a
group has about the same chance of actually getting
a drop as a solo player and vice versa.  If 1 in 2
group mobs drop chests, a drop rate of 1 in 12
from solo mobs would be equal -- since groups, in
theory, have six players sharing loot....
