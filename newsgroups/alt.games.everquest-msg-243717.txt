You don't get it, do you? No, no one is charging me 2pp for every 1pp
I get. They're charging me cash above what I'm paying for what should
be total access of the server for an item that they're hogging the
camp for. If they were charging me plat to have the item or the camp,
fine, but they're taking it to outside, REAL currency. I'm already
paying money, I have the right to have access to the item without
having to pay more.
