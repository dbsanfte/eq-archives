Grats! The game can be very rewarding at times (and frustrating at the
same moment).

If you continue to desire to farm pelts, a GREAT spot when you get a
little higher would be Jaggedpine forest at the poacher camp. They
drop tons of pelts of all (almost) qualities (LQ-MQ-HQ - no ruined -
sorry). You should be low to mid 40s before you try tho. And for an
outdoor zone, the xp isnt bad either.

Blocks of Velium sell really well too. Ive probably made 25-30k
farming velium and selling in bazaar. Crystal Caverns is a good spot
to get velium and you can hunt there in your 30s. Problem is, youll
run into other high level farmers, so competition may be fierce
(havent been in a while so not sure these days). Another GREAT spot
for Velium is hunting in Skyshrine, which you can start in your mid to
 upper 30s. Few people hunt here, and the mobs near the Wakening Land
zone are pretty easy. However, you should know, this will wreck your
Claws of Veeshan faction. If you eventually want to do the really nice
quests in Skyshrine, you may not want to do this, however it can be
repaired by hunting in Kael (i hear it can be repaired rather quickly
doing several Arena raids).

Another spot for velium would be Tower of Frozen Shadows on the 5th
level, the ushers of the wedding drop it, and theres some other nice
loot on that level. The zone is extremely fun, with each level
offering something different. If you do go here (and the first level
can be hunted by 30s), youll have to camp for keys to each level.
Oddly, the 4th level is much harder than the 5th.
