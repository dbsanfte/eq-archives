Kill spiders, sell their silks.  Sounds crazy, but you can get over
2pp each for things that drop commonly off things you can kill
under level 10, and you can find exp giving mobs that drop them
up to level 50 at least.  Best hunting is in East Karana, where
the crag spiders and carrion spiders pop in quantity, the Crags
drop up to 6 silks at a time.

At very low levels, killing Orc Centurions in GFay and Crushbone
used to be another excellent approach, with their common drop
Crushbone Belts selling for a couple pp... but I'm not sure
the market held up so well now that 1 to 10 is so much easier
and faster.

Hill Giants in Rathe Mountains are the classic money camp,
they drop an average of 10pp each, and are relatively
plentiful and easy to kill, sadly they are well known and thus
often not as plentiful as you might like.

NG in Sebelis is probably the best money camp I've seen,
with frequent gem drops up to and including blue diamonds,
you are easily looking at several Kpp an hour here... but you
probably need a group, so that gets split out a bit.
