  Yeah, mammoths suck.  The tusks are nice, but I've only been able to
find them once when I was looking.  But, let me take back a bit of
what I said.  It can't hurt to try the shadowed men if that's what you
want to do.  Just be ready to high tail it to the zone line, or have
Gate ready in case you accidentally overpull.  The worst that could
happen is that you die once.  Still, it overall probably wouldn't be
worth the trouble, but you might want to try fighting them for some
variety at least.

  However, I'm a big fan of the forest giant fort, presuming your
system is strong enough to handle the bad frame rates of the Warsliks
(though it isn't quite as bad inside the fort area), there aren't as
many trees to render) and level 24 is about the perfect level to hunt
there.  It should do you good up until you get your next rank of
spells at least.
