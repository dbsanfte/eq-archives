Ageed . IMHO part of the joy which is EQ (more so as a newbie) is the fear of dieing. I remember running my 1st char 
from qeynos to FP Crapping myself all the way. =)....ugh died in Kithicor with 2 casts from something i never even saw. 
Thank Karana for /loc. Then the even scarier journey to CR neked and find corpse in kith boy did i loot that corpse fast.( 
Have never felt like that in any game )

PS wish i knew then that you could bind in HK
