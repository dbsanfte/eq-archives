These people are probably typing in credit card numbers and info all day
long.
Screwing up on some cards is inevitable.
I order credit cards all day at work myself.
Sometimes, but not often, I get one back that is labeled wrong,
names backward or misspelled.  It doesn't mean I'm incompetent,
just means I'm human.

Oh and losing a friend doesn't give you a license to be a jerk.
