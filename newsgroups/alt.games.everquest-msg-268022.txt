I don't really know. I don't think they ar ethe same.

There are similarities but nothing is the same. I think for example the 
EQ2 shadowknight has a harm touch *spell* at some level.

You have two levels in EQ2. Your adventure level and your tradeskill 
level. And you choose your adventure class and your tradeskill class 
totally independently. You do have to choose a combat class but you 
don't have to do anything with it (*)
You can level up by doing tradeskills, but it levels up your tradeskill 
level, not your adventure level. It's probably a little painful to not 
levekl up your adventure level though as you might want to forage for 
components and it will make it a whole lot safer.

(*) You need to level up your character to adventure level 6 and then 
complete your citizenship test to gain access to most of your starting 
city. Late in beta they had an alternative for tradeskillers but there 
was a problem so they removed it saying they would put something back in 
  soon.

Yes you can die with any tradeskill. There are events you have to 
respond to while making things. If you don't respond correcly one of the 
penalties is taking some damage. You get a while to respond so it needs 
some concentration rather than video game skills :) You can die but it's 
  not very easy to do so. I don't think you take as much damage as you 
could during beta.
