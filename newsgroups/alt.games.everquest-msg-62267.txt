Yes they are.  I'm not talking about with special abilities. Like mend
or that skeleton form mana conversion, or cannabism, I'm talking base
regen rates.  The argument was about downtime. In EQ yes your downtime
can be lessened by certain skills or spells, but your downtime is
naturally lesser in DAoC.  Therefore Soloing has inherently less
downtime then EQ.

Goes up? What are you talking about? Either it's a constant or it
scales. It can't do both.  Since all of the clarity spells are X per
tick, and since the time to recover mana/life from nearly empty
continuously increases over the life of a character it's pretty damn
hard to see how it scales. 

Buffs, spells and stuff like that do not count because they cannot
apply to everyone, only those set classes who have them. Every class
in DAOC recovers mana from empty in 4 minutes flat. Some can do it
faster with mana regen songs. Don't try and compare boosted regen
rates from people who have clarity 2 on with base recovery rates fro
DAoC its an unfair comparison.  BTW, sitting, with mana song on, it
takes my bard 1 min, 35 seconds to recover full mana.
