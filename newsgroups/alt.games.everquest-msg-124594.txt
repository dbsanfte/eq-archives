Exactly why I've been asking them to do it this way for three years.
I've done phone customer service and it makes more sense to have a
call center of 15 people helping customers rather than one person
helping only customers from New York and another only customers from
Las Vegas. If all the New york people are gone, then the customer is
told "sorry but no New York people are back until Tuesday. They
figured out that would be the wrong way to do it in phone CS from the
very beginning, yet it took Verant 3 years. 

I remember back when I had a faction problem and some guide goes,
"sorry this server's GM won't be back until (date that was 3 days from
then) so repetition then!" This would be like you calling your phone
company to have something done that could be done by a flunky, and
being told that the flunky for your area is not back for 3 days. How
long would you continue that service?

Exactly, decentralized CS is the only good option. It also makes for a
much more uniform customer service experience. You don't want a player
from FV saying his Gm is good while a player from Innoruk says his
sucks, that is not good consistent CS.

It should be pretty huge actually. The server gm for a particular
server was just hardly around.. I mean the person works say 7 and a
half hours with lunch out of a 24 hour period. That means that odds
are not very good that if you play at weird times he will ever be
availible.
