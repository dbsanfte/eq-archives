I agree with you here.  Interestingly enough, there's a better way
to do it, and they are aware of it.  One of the devs (Scott Hartsman,
AKA Gallenite) posted in a thread regarding audible tell notification
on the Tower.  EQ Watcher does this, and he mentioned that he thought
it was a good idea.  Obviously they took a simple idea and wrecked it.

An audible tell notification (a bark on one box, a ding on the other)
and a window for tells keeps me abreast of them just fine, even in
raids.

I have the same thing set up for messages in the pet channel we use
on raids (9 of 42 raiders last time were pet classes) - an audible 
warning and a seperate window.
