INT is generally easier.
For one thing, INT casters have overall higher base starting INT, so
there's less need for items to boost that stat.

However, as someone currently sitting on 262 (or would be if it wasn't
capped at 255) WIS and 1050+ AC (seriously, I cannot LOWER my WIS
without losing AC/hps or resists), both are stupidly easy to cap at
higher levels.

Current pet project is to break 1100AC...for a druid (a leather
class), that's pretty damn impressive I think.  Not to mention pretty
damn useless.

The shawl is a caster item:  both INT and WIS casters.
Much like the ring is a melee item.
