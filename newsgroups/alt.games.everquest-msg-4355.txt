Sorry, there is nothing to fight about here.  I posted your description
of your entrance to this NG in your own words to help you with your
selective memory issue.  Your words in the post I replied to seem to be
conveying a different description than you stated at the time of the
events.  You came, you trolled, you went back to your fa group and
posted those facts.  You and I both know the facts, there really is
nothing more to say on that subject, let alone fight about.  

If you have indeed purchased the game and do in fact come to subscribe,
please have a wonderful time playing the game its really a lot of fun. 
But so far as I know buying the game or even playing it won't change
your past acts, nor will saying otherwise now.  If you want to overcome
your past acts you must apply that intent to future acts, your reply to
this post is your first opportunity.  Choose as you will, that is the
gift and curse of life, the choice is yours and so are the results. 
Enjoy...
