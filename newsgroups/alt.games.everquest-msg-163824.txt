It is entirely possible to make a small profit on a lot of the annoying,
easy to make items in various tradeskills because the high end tradeskillers
often do not want to be bothered with making that crap.  The trick is to
figure out which ones are needed often.  Metal bits are largely needed in
the skillup process, but not so much in making the high end items, although
there are a few items that do require them.  I suspect that it would be a
decent way to make small amounts of plat over time.
