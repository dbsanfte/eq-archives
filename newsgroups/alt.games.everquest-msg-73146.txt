I did not accuse anyone of wrong doing, I just said I thought it was
odd that "donation" money went to a person's personal needs. I'd like
to upgrade my computer also but I don't think I should make a web site
and then use donations to do it.

Maybe you see something wrong with it which is why you have to justify
it. Mostly I stated facts.

Asking for donations for a site causes a person to assume that it is a
not for profit site. Not for profit means you are not making any money
from it, not making any money from it means you are not spending any
money from it. Computer upgrades are you spending money from it.

"While we've managed to keep this site ad free and fee-free since the
launch of the site a month after EQ went live, we're at the point
where we're going to have to accept donations in order to keep the
site running."

nothing there saying "and to upgrade my computer at home."
