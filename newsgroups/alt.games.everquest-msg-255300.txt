As others have said you need a license key and if the one that came with 
  the game is used there is nothing you can do...

Except - Sony seem to be offering a free trial at the moment on
http://everquest.station.sony.com/trilogy/download.jsp

The free trial only lets you play on a particular server but I presume 
that you can upgrade it to a full subscription.

Maybe. Might be worth a look anyway.
