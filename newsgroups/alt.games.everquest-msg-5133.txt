Im getting this error "The system has detected a conflict for IP address
10.0.0.1 with the system having hardware address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
The XX is different numbers, when i get this error i can press ok then i get
the same error with a different XX a couple more times. This happens 99% of
the time while playing Everquest but has happened once while browsing the
web.
Can anyone give me some suggestions?
