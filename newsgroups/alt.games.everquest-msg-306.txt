Hello,

I just started a Barbarian Shaman.. Read a previous post about it by a
Barb Shaman and said "Hey, I think this one is for me"... Anyhow I'm
really enjoying it.

However, I need some help so I'll list my questions.

1 - What are the easy newbie quests that I should do? What should I do
in general? (I've gotten to level 3 without any idea on what to do aside
from kill those little newbie critters, mobs?)

2 - Are there any important spells that I really need to get at level 1?

3 - Whats the best trade skill to learn for my class if I want to role
play and help my character the most?

4 - Is there anything I should stay well clear of?

Thanks,

W
