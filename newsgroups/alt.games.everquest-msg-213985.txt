A variety - it really is the best I can suggest - if you havent got
friends to play with and so a slot to drop into then just tryh a number of
classes. Read the descriptions and start with a good look see. Level 1 to
10 are do-able pretty quickly and give you a brief intro to what most
classes can do - by lvl 10 you have gained a reasonable set of class
skills for non casters so you see what they might be able to do, the
hybrids gain their first spells and pure casters have got 3 or so grades
of spells....

Its to me the best ratio of time to spend playing a possible throwaway vs
insight to the class.
I tend to advise against playing a bard first - it techincally very
difficult.

A ranger has the combination of basic rogueish skills, some casting
(though its druid absed rather than arcane) and sensible fighting power.
Its the closest to that combo in AD&D. Bard fits as well and is better
fitting actually - BUT as I said I tend to advise against people playing
bards first off.

eq.crgaming.com - good class descriptions for everything including spell
range, skills range and advise on play style. Read learn and inwardly
digest.
