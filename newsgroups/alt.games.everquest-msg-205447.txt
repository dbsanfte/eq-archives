My buddy 2boxes a cleric/ranger all the time.  He does
it so well that the 2 people in our group today who didn't
know he was running both *THOUGHT THEY WERE DIFFERENT
PEOPLE*  He chain pulls on the ranger, root park CC's on
the cleric and uses archery for outstanding DPS (you do
know that there is no auto-attack for archery, right?)

We got a serious overpull of 4 golems in PoV today (that's
4 544 hitting, level 62 mobs) and a combination of pet
tanking (with the cleric healing them) root parking and
some really fancy footwork by the shaman allowed us to
deal with it.  

So, whatever the shortcomings of the moron you played with,
there are some people who play 2 characters far better than
many people play one.

And therein lies the fun - for him a single character doesn't
offer enough to do.  Much like the very best high level bards
out there, they want the most challenging experience possible.
