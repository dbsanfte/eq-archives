First off, although my mother is legally allowed to own a handgun, she 
does not, and likely never would.  Even if she did, I can just about 100% 
guarantee that it would be used against her long before she would have 
the opportunity to use it against said perp.

And as for the fate of said perp, I'd much rather see him strung up by 
the balls than just shot.
