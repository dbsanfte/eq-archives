Anyone know where to find info about the new zones - specially
how to get there, please ?
How comes, that you only get a cd when you buy a EQ expansion -
not a single word about how or when you can take benefit of the
expansion?
There's a new buff slot - great, why not drop a line or two about
how to get it work and so on.
There's a new epic - am i the only one that is frustrated that you dont
find a single line about that.
When i buy a expansion to a game i expect information - i dont expect
that i have to spend more time out game than in game to figure out, what
is new and how to make it work.

Just a frustrated pip from here.

Kim
