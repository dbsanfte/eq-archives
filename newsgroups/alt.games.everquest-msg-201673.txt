Because there aren't many.  We are free spirits, not bound by conventional
standards or city law, but can easily join any May Day celebration.  Dancing is
natural to us.  We are unafraid alone in the woods, and can forge a new path. 
Weeks alone in the wild collecting pelts and herbs is our way of life.  But we
are usually agreeable to companionship, especially on long journeys.  Barbarian
warriors are very compatible. As are Erudite wizards.  
You must be strong in spirit, body, and mind to choose this road.
