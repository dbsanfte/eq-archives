Thanks for the response. A couple more questions:

1. Do *you* still play EQ?
2. Are there any new servers? aka not top heavy, more low level players.

As for SWG, I have been following the development of that game for over 2 
years and their recent changes and daily developments lately have made me 
decide with 95% certainty that I will not buy that game, because it's 
going to most likely be a HUGE disappointment.
