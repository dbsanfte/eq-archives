     First off I agree with you 110% that using your guild to rip off a newbie
is awful. Especially a guild officer that's unforgivable.
     
     However he really should have been more careful.  There are "grief"
players out there so there are going to be "grief" guilds. Just because he
typed /guildinvite that doesn't mean you can trust him completely.  You have to
get to know your guild just like you would another player.

     Respect is earned never given!
