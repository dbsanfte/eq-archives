Well, I took all my girls to Misty Thicket as soon as they were able to make
the trip, even the dwarven cleric I had for 5 short levels. The reason that
I did was A) I knew and was used to the area and B) there's stuff to hunt
close by up til about level 12-13. (which is also true of the advice given
to you about going to FP. EC and WC provide rather decent hunting til about
16 (I just stopped killing wisps at 17)) However, if you did this, you'd
have to take the boat (yeah, people get ported all the time, but *I* can't
afford what they ask, so I run or I boat) from the dock where Glorin Binfurr
stands, to FP, then make your way from FP (due east) to East Commonlands,
West Commonlands, through Kithicor (which you should absolutely NOT go into
from 6pm (game time) to 8am) and into Rivervale, thence into Misty Thicket.
You're old enough to hunt "the other side of the wall" now, so long as
you're careful, and in about 3-4 lvls, might be able to take on the
Runneyeye gobs... (that sound right, guys??) though I'm not as sure of that
as I once was, as I think they've revamped the Citadel. I ran my lvl 18
druid through there last night, on my way to the Karanas, and she got hit a
few times by something called a goblin Neophyte. Dunno what it was, but
druid took about 12 pts damage for each hit and kept on running to Beholder.
In MY opinion, the area around Misty is more <entertaining>. Yeah, for a few
lvls, you get to kill the same shit you've been killing, but after that,
there's Mooto, and ... crap, can't recall the other named gob... you can
kill, and orcs in the back of Misty, skellies on the hill, then when you get
high enough, it's just a hop across to Runnyeye. Runnyeye is dangerous on
the 2nd and 3rd levels because of the eyes (Borxx, most notably) and the
casters. I've also seen some casters on the top level, though I don't know
if people train them there or if they spawn there.


Oh, and yes, get a bind, first thing... not many things worse than having to
do a corpse run on the boat.
If you're on Innoruuk, I'll bind you, just give a holler -- name is Darklet,
and I have en enchanter named Jannael who can also bind.

Just my humble opinion, for what it's worth.
Dark
