SoL is by the far the worst of the three expansions, unless I'm not
remembering right.

My recollection of Kunark was that the biggest problem was that they
didn't process quite a few of the orders fast enough, and so many
(including me) had the game arrive a couple of days after Kunark went
live.  I don't recall any major glitches with Kunark itself, and the
people who did get it on time had a couple days head start on the rest
of us.  That caused a fair amount of anger on the part of those who
did not get it on time, because it was the *first* expansion, and
there was a lot of excitement at trying to be among the first to
explore the new lands.

There were messed up loot tables early with Kunark, but I'm not
counting those as a major glitch, since they don't annoy the players.
:-)

I didn't bother to preorder Velious, because I was a few levels below
the recommended levels.  Nevertheless, I got it on opening day, by
simply going down to the store and picking it up.  Again, I don't
recall any major glitches with Velious.

I didn't preorder SoL, because DAoC has become my main game.  However,
I did pick it up when I was in Best Buy and saw it on sale. :-)  The
only problem I've had with SoL so far is that I'm getting really
frustrated trying to summon a familiar...the spell uses conjuration,
which is a skill that before SoL was basically totally useless to
wizards.  I fizzled a full bar of mana trying to get the damn level 49
familiar spell to work, and then spent a while medding up and casting
one of the few low level conjuration spells over and over to get
conjuration up, but only got it to about 55, and then fizzled away all
my mana again without getting a familiar, so I logged out. :-)  That
annoyance was somewhat offset by finding a Ring of Frost (+3 int, +10
mana) for sale at a vendor for 7 plat while I was looking for the
wizard spells.  Since I was using a +2 int ring on one hand, that was
a nice quick unexpected equipment update.
