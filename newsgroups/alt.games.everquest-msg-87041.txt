As explained to me by a friend who guides, any time a petition about
continual grief playing comes in (assuming a full guide or higher is on
line) they will standardly go anon/invis and go check it out. You've
obviously already given her the benefit of the doubt that she might just
be ignorant (which is curable) and allowed her to move into full blown
grief player mode. (By level sixty, she obviously knows that if a dorf
gets the last blow on your giant, you'll lose the xp = intentional
causing of xp loss for another player.)

As soon as she starts kiting in that area next time you're there, I'd
keep your mouth shut (to her) unless you can get her to say the same
smartass line for a /report, and petition her ass. If a Guide see's her
intentionally kiting dorfs on top of your rooted giant, I imagine you'll
quickly have the camp area to yourself again.
