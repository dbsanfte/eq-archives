Well, I went back to Qeynos ... again.  (Stopped at Toxfodder's and made it
to Mistress of Poisons).
Sadly, the Silk Tunic has no graphic change at all.  I did all combinations,
even from DE-naked to DE-silk (no graphic at all).

On the bright side, I was bored and Gated out to Thurgadin narrowly missing
the entire massacre of the town and GD (and ME!) from the 10th Ring quest as
the Giants ransacked the area.  GD was left unpopped for hours so I wandered
into Velks and practiced my archery (too low for a group at 45).  An
Assassin friend of mine had known that Lannella had her birthday (1yr) this
week and gave me his old Reinforced Dragonhorn Boots (AC16) to upgrade my
AC4 junk that I'd been wanting to replace; that and Mithril Arms to replace
my RyGorr (1 less AC, but 7 Str).
Now, my AC has finally jumped over 800 and my ATK over 900 =)

I also got an invitation from a DR messageboard friend to come hunt in
Skyshrine with him to see if we can't drum up a guardian's robe (all/all)
for me :)  It'll be nice if we can make that work.
