This will be painful for some like yourself.  I've seen the same resentment
during the 'dumbing-down' of Ultima Online where alot of veterans felt
betrayed after having to struggle so long with unfinished and broken game
mechanics.

jaZZ - I'd be more worried about why exactly VI has decided to start
implementing such sweeping changes.  Someone else commented on appealing to
the 'LCD' or whatever and I think that's exactly it.  This company is in the
business of making money and if they can get more subscriptions or reel back
in some of the folks who couldn't stomach sitting blindly looking at a
spellbook for even 2 levels - then they're doing a fine job indeed (by the
bottom line of course).

While your reaction is not uncommon, I'm even more interested in what Brad
thinks about these changes.  His baby is in the process of getting breast
implants, purple dyed hair, and a tongue pierce at the moment.
