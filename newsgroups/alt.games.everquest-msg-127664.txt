Hmmm...I was doing a single wyvern in CS, so no AoE involved other than my
snare (I'm a Wizard), which was while the wyvern was well away from anything
else, and had a regular drake jump in help the wyvern.  I'd ran singles by
drakes before with no problem, so have no idea what was different this time.
I was level 52 at the time, and amiable to wyverns and drakes.
