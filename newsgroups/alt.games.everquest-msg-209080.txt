No. 

Get Punishing Blade, not Ambidex. 2H'ers outdamage pretty much all
dual wield combinations once you're at the levels you're that far
into your AA. Pre end game raiding things like the war marshalls
bladed staff is the best bet in terms of cash-for-dps. Once you're
end game raiding the two handers from Ssra, Sol Ro or PoE blow away
the one handers and if you ever get into time AA is so trivial
Ambidex will be a single mornings gameplay to get.

Two handers also mean you lose less DPS while you nuke as you can
cast between swings and you take far far less riposte damage. Once
a single riposte can be over 2000hp this is significant.

Spell Casting Fury 3 is also worthwhile, as is Guardian of the
Forest if you're a regular trueshot user. A single point in mental
clarity is nice, given the cheapness of it too.

However; A dead ranger is doing no damage. Once you start fighting
serious AE mobs where you have to be in range you may want to
consider whether you need more hp. If you already survive your
entire raids without deaths then you can safely ignore it for the
time being, I suppose.

Natural durability is extremely useful in all situations. Lightening
reflexes is great if you tank in XP groups. Combat stability/Innate
defense is largely not worth the investment.

Do not underestimate the value of utility AA like innate camo and
entrap either.
