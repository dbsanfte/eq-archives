I died at Woushi's hands about four hours ago (Just a quick trip before
coming to work this morning.  I thought!)  So it has only been four hours so
far.  Are you saying he lives a short while and despawns, not to spawn again
for a long while?

If yes, maybe I could travel to WL by foot from the Great Divide Dragon Ring
and if I don't see him on track, drag my corpse to safety?  Can I bind at
the Tower?
