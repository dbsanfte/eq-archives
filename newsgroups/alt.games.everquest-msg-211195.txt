Let's start with your basic meleeing mobs, which is mostly what you will
encounter at your level.  For these mobs, the fight will consist of you and
your group hitting, nuking, and DOTing the mob, which the mob hits one or
more of your group members, and the healers heal the group members that are
getting hit.

Whether or not a group will win such a fight is a simple matter of which
runs out first: the mob's hitpoints, or the groups ability to take damage.
With a little experience, your group should be able to tell not too long
into a fight whether or not you will win.  If everyone starts at full health
and mana, a good indication is to compare the healer's mana to the mob's HP.

If the healer is using 10% of their mana for every 5% the mob HP goes down,
for example, then there could be a problem...healing will be stopping when
the mob is at 50%, so if the tanks won't be able to survive the last 50%
without healing, you'll lose.

On the other hand, if the mob is going down 20% health for every 10% healer
mana, than you'll probably win.

Anyway, as you observe fights, you'll start to get a feel for how this
works, and if you can somehow find out how hard and frequently a mob hits,
and how many HP it has, and how hard it is to hit the mob beforehand, you'll
be able to make a reasonable guess as to whether or not your group can take
it.

As a Necro, you have a fine tool for finding out that information: your pet.
If there is an unkown mob, have the group on alert and ready to flee on your
command, and send in the pet.  From how fast the pet loses health, and how
fast the pet damages the mob, you'll get information that you can compare
against mobs you are familiar with, and figure out just where this new mob
fits in.  With a little experience, you'll be able to then tell the group
whether they should rush in and take the mob, or whether everyone should
head to the zone while the pet takes one for the team.

Nukes are also good for judging a mobs HP.  As a Wizard, I can tell after
the first nuke or two whether I can solo a meleeing mob or not.  If I have
enough mana to nuke 10 times after snaring without dipping into my emergency
reserve, and the first nuke only takes the mob down to 92%, it's time to
root and gate.  If the first nuke takes it down to 85%, I'm happy.  In
either case, after the fight or flight, It's a simple matter to divide the
damage I did by the fraction the mob's HP went down, and thus find out how
many HP it had.

Later, you'll run into mobs that do more than melee.  If you have time, you
can figure out something about a mob by just watching it for a while.  If
you see it cast SOW and Inner Fire on itself, for example, it is probably a
Shaman, and you can assume it will use Shaman DOTs and nukes on your party,
and will be hasted and will try to slow your party.

The same general principles that apply to melee mobs apply here...if the mob
runs out of HP before your party runs out of damage taking ability, you win.
It's just that figuring out what will happen is a little harder if the mob
is healing itself, and nukes and DOTs are flying.  Again, letting a pet take
the risk the first time is probably a good idea.

When fighting a possible caster that you are not familiar with, another good
thing to do is take it out fast the first few times, until you are used to
what it does.  For example, if you've got Wizards, they should nuke more
than normal (but not enough to draw aggro), rather than pacing themselves to
reduce group downtime.  Once your group understands the severity of the
mob's DOTs or healing or nukes or whatever, and so can take them into
account when judging whether or not they are going to win a fight, you can
go back to killing efficiently, rather than fast.
