1 percent is high for a 96% rez at 65 too.  A full death at 65 is about
5-6%, so .04 * 6 = .24.  So about 4 deaths to the percent.  This meshes
with my experiences.  With my current cushion (16%) I can take 65 or so
rezzed deaths before I can't get 65 back on rez.

So I doubt very much that many people lost their level - and if they did
it's the matter of a half an hour xp'ing to get it back.
