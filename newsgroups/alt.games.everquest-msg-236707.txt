Here is what people suggested:

Posted by myself:

A 'popular' route:

Newbie zone till lvl 5
Crushbone till lvl 16
Paludal Caverns till lvl 24
High Hold Keep till lvl 34
Dawnshroud Peaks / Overthere till lvl 40
Echo Caverns / Dreadlands till lvl 46+
Plane Of Justice Exit / Basement camps till lvl 55
Plane of Valor till lvl 62
BoT till lvl 65

Of all these places, crushbone probably requires the most skill :)
(depending on camp).

An alternative route:

Newbie zone till lvl 5
Blackburrow till lvl 12-15
Estate of Unrest until lvl 30 (can go to 35 here though).
Split Paw until lvl 34
Gulf Of Gunthak until lvl 40
Dulak first boat till 45ish
Nadox elementals till lvl 50 (not sure if enough for a full group here, and
some pulls through lava etc, plenty of other stuff around).
Old sebilis till lvl 55 (need a key)
After seb, pop is probably the best route, aside from plane of valour you
can try Pof Storms, Crypt of Decay.

Lvl 1 - 8 or 9: Field Of Bone.  Good xp and lots of wonderful bone chips
drop
that you can sell in bazaar.

Lvl 10 - 14 or so: Kurn's Tower (which is in Field of Bone :)  )  Again,
nice
xp and many bone chips.

14 - 18 or so: Paludal Caverns hunting Pharty Guys.  You have to group these
or
duo with a healer preferably.  They have a rather wicked disease
affectionately
referred to as 'The Crud'  Loot is bleh, xp is awesome.

18 - 24: Paludal Caverns in a Bandit Group.  Loot is ok, xp is phenominal.

24 - 35: High Hold Keep Basement Goblins.  Loot excellent, xp excellent.

35 - 46: LDoN, LDoN, LDoN!!!  Earn those points, get fairly ok loot and
really
good xp.

46 on up: Continue to LDoN but now start mixing in some Plane of Justice
Exit
Groupage to begin with and then branch out to all the other planes as they
become available to you at your level
