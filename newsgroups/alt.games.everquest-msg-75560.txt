I have a feeling that was more to encourage quoting than to discourage top
posting (which is irritating in itself, since you have to scroll down to see
what the reply was in response to).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
