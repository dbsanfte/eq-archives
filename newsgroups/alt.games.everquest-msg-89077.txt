Looking to obtain chanter spells Berserker STR and Color Shift, not having
great luck finding the right Tasarin's Grimoire, and only have 21 research
skill. Don't really want to waste time and money on that skill. For someone
who already has increased that skill, I'd like to have them create the
spells for me and I'll compensate.

Alternatively, can you buy these from any vendor, anywhere?
