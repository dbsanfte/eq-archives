Heres a new development, copy of email sent out by playerauctioons

Hello ,

Player Auctions is proud to announce its partnership with Cornered Rat
Software. Player Auctions will be the official auction site for all WWII
Online auctions. What exactly does this mean? CRS has endorsed Player
Auctions as their official auction site for all WWII Online auctions and in
return we will provide users with an exclusive forum to sell all WWII Online
related items.

We will be working with CRS to ensure accounts that are sold do not gain
command positions through auctions but players will be able to sell and
transfer accounts with rank to a new owner. At the end of any WWII Online
auction, Player Auctions will, as usual, email the winning bidder and seller
with contact information so the buyer and seller can finish the transaction.
In addition, Player Auctions will notify CRS of the auction via email.

This partnership between CRS and Player Auctions will help ensure that no
command positions are sold and will help eliminate all fraudulent sellers as
all auctions can be tracked, virtually eliminating sellers from reclaiming
accounts and buyers from reversing a charge on any WWII Online auction. The
buyer and seller information being sent is for tracking command positions
and to help ensure a safe transaction. This information will only be sent
for WWII Online auctions and will not be used for marketing purposes. Users
selling WWII Online auctions on Player Auctions do not have to worry about
accounts being suspended or banned, all WWII Online auctions being sold on
Player Auctions is approved and endorsed by CRS.
