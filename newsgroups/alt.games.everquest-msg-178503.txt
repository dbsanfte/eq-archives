I parsed my logs as to where I bought mine..

Circle of the Combines I bought from Roule in North Karana Gypsy camp (Not
the same vendor you do the concordance quest with, this guy stands to the
left of her)

Ring of the Combines I bought from Srendon Gladetender in Kelethin (He is in
Druid guild I believe)

Circle of Butcherblock I bought from Martyn Firechaser in Toxxuilia Forest
(The standard druid ring vendor position right next to the stones, unless he
has been aggroed, which happened to me once and I had to help the poor GM to
track him (He was halfway to Paineel zone))
