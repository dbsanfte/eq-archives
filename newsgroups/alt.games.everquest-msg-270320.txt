While you're at it, you should poke around and learn some about bittorrent. 
It's the "wave of the future" in software distribution, and is a bit of
technological genius, but to get it working well, particularly on an
asynchronous connection, requires a touch of knowledge and a little
fiddling.

But thanks for the pointer.  I think I'll sign up myself.  I always thought
it looked like a neat game, and even bought it when it came out, but the
initial launch was so incredibly bad that I gave up on it.  I'm assuming
they got all those technological hurdles figured out by now.
