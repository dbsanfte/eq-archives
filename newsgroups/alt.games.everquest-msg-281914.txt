Pirate Raid!

There is a MM in Butcherblock with the mission npc, Mister Squinch,
located on the shore just north from the harbor (near an anchored
ship). This mission is a pirate raid on East Freeport and the objective
is looting as much "plundered treasure" from the citizens' and guards'
corpses as possible within 45 minutes. If a minimum of 30 are looted,
then a chest spawns with either fitted chain boots or an aug.  The max
looted seems to be 100 and I have no idea if there is anything special
as a reward if you reach that total. The group selects from several
clases (rogues, warrior, cleric, and enchanter) and a decently composed
group is needed to move things along.

Train!

A MM in Lower Guk with the mission npc, a decrepit froglok, located in
Upper Guk near a zone line to Lower Guk (#7 on EQAtlas map of Upper
Guk). The mission is to defend Lower Guk (dead side) by forcing 40
Norrathian scu... I mean adventurers to leave within a one hour time
frame. This mission is pass/fail either you get them out or you don't.
Mostly the adventurers, who spawn in random locations and times, will
tend to flee if you actually see them (maybe if you get fairly close),
a few will fight for a bit and may actually come back a bit. They all
flee through the Bedroom heading towards the zoneline (point C on
EQAtlas Lower Guk, Dead side map). Once you succeed in getting the 40
to flee (you get a task message), a chest spawns at pt C. It may
contain a set of gauntlets or a range slot item.

Your group gets to choose to be ghoul warriors, shamans, ... I forget
all the choices. Since you don't have to kill any of the adventurers
(and probably can't without a LOT of effort), you don't have to be too
picky about your choices. You will spend a lot of time running through
Lower Guk searching for the adventurers and wil have to repeatedly
search areas every so often.

Note that if you stick around after "successfully" defending LGuk and
then time runs out you will get a "you have failed" message but you
still got the xp anyway.

Personally, I found Pirate to be enjoyable since I normally play
casters (I did a warrior and later a rogue) and Train was nice for I
got to explore (and fall into pits) Lower Guk while getting a bit of
nausea from doing this twice back to back (first was failure, we
couldn't find 13 of the 40).

Pirate needs a group -- need the dps. Train could be done by a single
active player (with 2 others on shared and grouped).

The downside is that they are almost completely BYOG.
