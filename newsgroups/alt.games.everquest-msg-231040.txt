I pay for alla's premium and use the vanilla magelo because it's
prettier for when that kind of thing matters. Updating 2 character
profiles is no hardship when you win rolls as infrequently as I do ;P

But no, I think the Alla's Premium service is invaluable. The search
facilities on there are superb, and the equipment upgrader is just
ingenious. (Like search but it gives everything a rank based on
stats you can tune, so if you're looking for WIS items, you can
weight items with WIS to have a higher rank... then it shows you
which items are upgrades for your character. This feature is worth
the price on its own.
