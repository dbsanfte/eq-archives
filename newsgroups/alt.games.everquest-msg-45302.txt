Hehe, not just the high level ones. Any of you druids here got the Beguile
Plants spell?
Level 29 spell, to my knowledge only useful on treants (bad faction),
Succulents (only in DL), and in Plane of Growth. I wouldnt even consider
doing the quest. Cant be done safely before 35 or above, take a LONG time
to do, need a lot of rare drops, and that spell is simply not worht
putting time into getting it.

Maybe with Lucin there will be more plant mobs, that will actually make
the spell useful.
