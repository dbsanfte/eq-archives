My room mate got a new Dell Dimension 4100 about a month ago. When he first
got it it had blistering framerates in every game we threw at it. I had been
using the zone alarm firewall program as I'm on cable. I was trying to
uninstall ZA to I could upgrade to the pro version but errors occured during
the uninstall and I could not install ZA pro. It somehow was not releasing
the proper sockets needed to get online and I was shit out of luck and
unable to get online. I called both Dell and @Home and even the technician
that came to my house could not get me online. They said I would have to
format and reinstall Windows. I have done this many times on my own PC so
that was not a problem. I called Dell and found out exactly how to do it to
get it back the way it was when they sent it. I reinstalled Win ME and lo
and behold I connect to @Home on the first try, Problem solved!

But now there is a terrible new issue. The Framerates seem to be cut in half
and EQ and unreal tournament and any other online game lock up every few
steps. This makes Q3 and UT totally unplayable anf EQ very unenjoyable. At
first I was using the newest detonetor XP drivers but the stuttering was
driving me crazy. My PC is only 300Mhz anf this one is 1100 and mine runs
smoothly. I thought it was a driver conflict of some sort so I reformatted
and reinstalled again. This time I'm using all the drivers that came with
the PC(the ones that were originally on it) but it is still doing it! This
is driving me crazy a brand new P3 should not be doing this!

I know many peeps have had this prob before so if anyone could provide any
help at all I would be most pleased. I really dont want to have to play on
my P2 300 hehe.
