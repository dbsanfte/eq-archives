The success rate for a tradeskill is determined solely by your level in 
that tradeskill.  Stats have no effect on success rates.  This isn't me 
saying so, it's the tradeskills programmer from Verant saying so.

See:

Not exactly; see the link in the answer to 1).  In short, the higher of INT 
and WIS gives you a bonus, with the lower of the two not being considered 
at all; smithing gets an additional bonus from STR; tailoring and fletching 
get an additional bonus from DEX.  Again, this is what the tradeskills 
programmer from Verant says, not me.

I do not think that these bonuses are as significant as is generally 
thought.  Consider the CHA bonus to NPC vendor buying and selling prices; 
for the most part the effect tops just over 100.  It would really be more 
proper to say that "low CHA gives a pricing penalty" than "high CHA gives a 
pricing bonus".  I think the same holds true for skill advance rates in 
tradeskilling.

The reason I think this is that I have been keeping meticulous records on 
my skill advance rate and success rate with my Ogre Warrior blacksmith.  
For the uninitiated, 175 is very significant in smithing because that is 
where banded maxes out and the next step is fine plate smithing.

0 to 100: 508 attemps, average of 5.08 attempts per level.
101 to 150: 377 attempts, average of 7.54 attempts per level.
151 to 175: 272 attempts, average of 10.88 attempts per level.
176 to 190: 301 attempts, average of 20.07 attempts per level.

The progression is glaringly obvious - 5, 7.5, 10, 20.  This was with STR 
at 155 and WIS and INT below 70 for all but the last 10 or so levels.  I 
feel quite certain that my bonuses to skill advance rates from stats have 
been maxed out.

To see the conversation which resulted from my posting this at eqtraders, 
see:

> Some argue that CHA has an effect.

The only effect of CHA is to modify your buying and selling prices with the 
NPC vendor.  This is a rather significant effect when you're buying a few 
thousand Blocks of Medium Quality Ore which cost 21pp at CHA 105 and 28pp 
at CHA 37.  Money spent by a blacksmith on CHA gear is money well spent.

File under "Untre Tradeskill Legends" along with the "raining weather 
reduces success rate" and "facing due north helps".

My abovementioned skill advance rates include many such streaks.  A theory 
put forth in the conversation linked to above suggests that the game keeps 
track of your skill advance rate and corrects for the hell levels with a 
few heaven levels, and vice versa.

This thread suggests that you should be okay making tempers at 155:

Keep in mind that the temper recipes should have the same minimum 5 percent 
failure rate as most tradeskill recipes, so expect to fail a minimum of 1 
out of 20.

Your high failure rate on paddings may be due to the skill level still 
being low.  That is to say, the higher your skill level, the fewer levels 
above you need to be to get the minimum 5 percent failure rate (this is a 
just a theory - I have no data to back it up with).
