Your name is the same as that of a very famous porn star.

Your rant is clearly an advertisement, but you dont' mark it as such.

You aren't, as far as I can tell, a regular poster here, so there's nothing for
us to base the quality of your word upon, other than these two facts.

As such, I'm forced to assume that Neocron is a shabby construct being foisted
by idiots upon the unsuspecting, worth about as much of my attention as those
web sites offering to show me how to make EQ pp quick.
