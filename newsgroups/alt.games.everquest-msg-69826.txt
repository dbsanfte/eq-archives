Ok, so I'm gonna guess that you mean you have to go through Runnyeye,
through the Gorge, through the Karanas, through Qeynos Hills, then through
Blackburrow to get to Everfrost and then to Halas right?  At level 10,
here's what I'd do...

/auction WTB Port to Surefall Glade Please

If you can camo through all of the above zones, you can make it...  However,
camo wears off at the most inopportune times and you will go down before you
know what hit you in either Runnyeye or the Gorge.  The Karanas are really
no picnic at level 10 either.  If you can't get several high levels to
escort you, then by all means get a port to Surefall.

What server are you on?  I'm on Tholuxe Paells and while I don't have SoW, I
do have camo and would be happy to run with you if we can arrange it.
Keeping in mind of course that I still go through all the above mentioned
zones up to QH with Camo on...  LOL
