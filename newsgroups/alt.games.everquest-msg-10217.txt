Pick lock works while sneak/hidden, so don't worry about dying. If you
see someone running, leave the door open and move.

Not happening.

Again, that's because they're non-humanoid and undead. For giggles
though , go to Crushbone some day and pick D'Vinn's heart from him. Then
give it back. [1]

Any place high enough so that you begin to "fall" (where you go in to
the animation) is fine for practice, be it a ledge or a hill. You don't
need greater heights to learn it at higher levels, either. [2]

[1] Psst... stories of people picking cash, highly valuable gems, quest
items and spells are true. I wouldn't advise pick-pocketing at all
unless it's okay with who you're grouping with, it's a mob you're
practising on on your lonesome, or you wish to become a social leper.

[2] Unless you want to learn bind wounds at the same time, too.
