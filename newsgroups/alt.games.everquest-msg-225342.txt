Thanks for giving a well thought out answer. Having played so many
classes to at least upper 50s (including the melee Warrior, Monk,
Ranger, and SK) I have lost all the class envy some posters show. The
changes make no sense and dont see how this helps the pure melee
classes.Warriors need agro control and Monks need AC, that does not
appear to have been addressed here.
