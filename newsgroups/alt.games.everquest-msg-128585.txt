heh where does SEQ come into it?   and to be honest, I'd be AMAZED if nobody
in your guild used SEQ/Sins.. whether they talk about it or not.. most if
not all "uber" guilds have a SEQ user.

But if your ebaying as opposed to de-guilding, you have no major incentive
to hand it in.. and not when that uber SoD and BoC etc etc is whats adding
several hundred $$ to your ebay price

As you can see with the SoDs now (and Stormhammer) you can't prevent items
being circulated nowadays (could you ever really?)

Well fair enough if they use DKP.. but the less you have need of mobs loot,
the faster you move onto bigger and better targets

So Cobalt BP's, nToV BoP's and SSRA BP's all have a similiar/same purchase
price now?   Thats ludicrous... I wonder how much stuff rots or is banked,
when some people could genuinally use an upgrade, because of that policy..

So trade them to a merchant and back... trail closed.  Also why is a GM
going to check the history of every pair of AoW pants/SoD because *you* ask
him to?

Im not doubting he got "hacked" (hack is such a buzz word nowadays..) but
getting hacked during an AIM conversation just seems to be going too far..
the whole "i know your hacking me please dont hurt my computer".. i don't
buy it

Yeah I found out the hard way... remember my main is a monk so i don't do
velious questing...  when I got my monks pants and bracer (ss and thurg) it
was the days of Vindi and Lord Bob/Velk raids... so because we never killed
Dain or Yeli, faction wasn't an issue.

I didnt expect her to talk to me if she wouldn't quest with me.. so when she
eat my silk stuff and made me mad, I promptly killed her.. damn dorfs!

RBB.

The main thing is I don't want a sub-par no-drop cloak.. so am limited to
buying something myself (for some reason very few CoF's are selling on
Prexus)..  if I get haste in a cloak I want something on a par with Dozes
cloak (theres no point going for something thats not end-game gear because
it just gets banked and rots.. so I'll just wait.)

I've got the PP for one anyway, so its just a matter of time :)
