I'm new to the EQ world, starting to play only this year, so I've missed a
lot where the game's development history is concerned. When were tradeskills
raped? For Sony to hardwire financial loss into successful combines is
beyond unreasonable. At least they could be set to break even, especially at
max CHA.
Can someone give me a history lesson here?
