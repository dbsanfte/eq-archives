This is exactly the logic I'm using, only I come to opposite
conclusions.

Kills per hour come from mana efficiency, its true, but I'm not
getting more kills per hour one way or the other.  On the other
hand, with Nuke kiting, I can read the paper between brief
bouts of action, with root/DOT (when it works, which at this
point is rarely) I must stay focussed on the tedious "action"
the whole time.  Maybe I get one more kill per hour out of it,
but it hardly seems worth it.
