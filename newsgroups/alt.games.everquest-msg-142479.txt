SNARE + DD/DOT = (DOT) Kiting
SNARE + DD/DOT + ROOT = Root Kiting
SNARE + DD/DOT + AEDD + up to 4 mobs = AE Kiting

That's what I live for.
For me kiting is a technique that allows the Druid to get untouched 
by a MOB while this mob is HP-drained and slowed.
Then you can use every kind of offensive spells: DD, AEDD, DOT, 
AEDOT (do we have some? Bards have AEDOTs for sure)...

Root is a spell I cast when I have already snared the mob, so I 
still do kiting, it just allows me to med and heal if necessary 
while the mob is DOTted. Then when my mana point raise, I will /sit 
off and nuke with DD.
All that are not anything else that variants of the same thing: 
KITING = hunt mobs without getting hit.

We could almost say that Chanter's Mesmerize could be used to do 
some kiting to...

That is what I think, I wait for your opinions.
I hope I made my English writing clear enough. I probably made some 
mistakes again because I thought about one thing but I did a bad 
translation :/
