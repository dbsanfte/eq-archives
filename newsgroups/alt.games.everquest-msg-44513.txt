Has anyone else noticed a tremendous problem getting the frenzied ghoul to
spawn in the last couple of days?

I'm not talking about getting the FBSS to drop.  I mean getting the frenzied
ghoul to appear at all.  We tried for 20 hours last night and saw not one
frenzied ghoul - the second day that's happened.

Anyone else experienced this?  I used to see a frenzied every two or three
spawn cycles.

Thanks.
