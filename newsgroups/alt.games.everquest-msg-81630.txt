Cool!  Fun, isn't it?

Now when you hit 55, please forget that you have it.  :)

Warriors *tank* and their defensive discipline at 55 is the defining reason
they pull so far ahead of lesser tanks in the very high end game.  My monk
tanks better than most any under-55 warrior, as long as the cleric
cooperates, but 55+ I just don't compare to a warrior and 80% of the reason
for that is the defensive discipline.
