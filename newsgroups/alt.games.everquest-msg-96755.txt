That's right. Forgot about that one. What were they thinking when they
gave the female barbs that "Teenage Mutant Transformer" look? I don't
get that one at all.

Oh, and regarding the exploitation aspect, um, have we all seen the
barb and human males? Not exactly 98-pound weaklings. Sure, barbarians
are supposed to be large, but not necessarily built like Arnold
Schwartsen...Schwartzonag...Schwertz...the Terminator guy.

It IS a game after all - not meant to be a reflection of RL. I just
have fun. :)
