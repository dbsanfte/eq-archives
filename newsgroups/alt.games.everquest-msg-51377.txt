Actually, a RAID 0 (striping without parity, if memory serves me..)
setup will drastically increase your data transfer rates.  If you're
using two disks in a RAID 0 setup, you're effectively doubling your
data transfer rate because the data gets divided in half and is
written to both disks at the same time.  

SCSI is generally the way you wanna go with a RAID setup, but can be
damned expensive.  I've heard some decent things about some of the new
IDE RAID cards out there though.
