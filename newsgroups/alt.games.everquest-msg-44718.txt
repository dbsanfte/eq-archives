You capture the problem pretty well here.  The skills of rogues by
nature would make them too powerful if not balanced as the skills are so
useful.  I see the best way to balance them as giving them great tools
to avoid confrontation or make nasty sneak type attacks, but if standing
toe to toe with an enemy having to use all focus on not getting one
shotted by the big sword.  Not to say that they are defenseless, far
from it, but rather that in a head to head battle damage avoidance and
chance to flee being their primary tools rather than offense.  Offense
on their part requiring stealth attacks that if successful are deadly
fits the class well, though balancing that ability so that it isn't
overpowering is very hard.
