This will probably come as a shock to you, but the guide didn't know
what he was talking about <g>. Try and contact a GM to get your gem
back if you don't want to do the freeport trip again. I know for a
fact that a 20th lvl shaman can do everything up Black Dire. Took a
couple of deaths on the trial of patience, at least one shark down
there sees through invis to animals and has a huge agro range on a
20th lvl. I ended up agroing and root parking Abe for about 15 minutes
while she ate a couple of deaths getting back to the spot.
Surprisingly, the really hard part was the final turnin in EJ. The mix
of undead and regular mobs makes invis pretty useless and again, the
mobs have a huge agro radius at 20th lvl. Myself and a 60th lvl monk
had at least 10 adds root parked or being trained around at the end.
And yes, the clicky sow does work at that level. 

Rgds, Frank
