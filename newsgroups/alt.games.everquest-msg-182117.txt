I can assure you that high Wisdom does indeed affect skillups.  My INT on my
shaman is well below 100, my WIS is pegged at 260 currently, and my skillup
rate is the same as it is for someone with an equivalent INT.  There you go,
someone just took the time to write down the opposite of what you read, hope
that helps.

Go to what is the best tradeskill website for EQ on the web,
www.eqtraders.com, and see what people have to say about it there, where
many many tradeskillers hang out, and compare notes.
