If the rez timer was "about" 3 hours, then you're right, its
supporting evidence for the theory that the rez timer freezes
when you log.

But this doesn't explain those numerous corpses where the
rez timer says *exactly* three full hours ("3 hours, 0 minutes,
0 seconds") left -- even if the guy camped as soon as he
respawned after a death, he would have run off at least a
minute or so of his alloted 3 hours.  Nor can that many
people have all blown out of the game going LD while doing
their "death zone-over", which is the only way I can think
of to get out of the game without using up *any* of your
rez timer.

Instead, something else seems to be at work for the
corpses with the "exactly 3 hour" rez timers.

The only clue I've gotten so far is the time a few
weeks ago that I was waiting for a rez for my corpse,
and for lack of anything better to do checked the
rez timer on it every once in a while.  Sure enough,
the timer was counting down.  Then I got trained and
died again, producing a second corpse.  When I got
back there from my bind point, I found that the new
corpse had the expected rez timer amount (about
2 hours and 45 minutes; it had taken me 15 to get
back to the dungeon), but the original corpse, which
definitely had had a partially used up rez timer, now
indicated *three hours exactly* -- and its timer was
frozen there.

I have since tried to repeat that sequence of
events on purpose, but have not managed to reproduce
the results.

But there are still an inordinate number of corpses
lying around Norrath with exactly 3 hours left on
their rez timers -- way too many to explain by
people who went LD the instant they died.
