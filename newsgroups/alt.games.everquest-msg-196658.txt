Do you honestly think this would really ever happen?  Someone would
raid while AFK and with auto-follow on?  It seems terribly unlikely.

How could mez and/or charm be automated?  I don't see how.

Do rogues actually backstab, evade, and pickpocket every 3 seconds
for hours on end?!  I had no idea.

: automate mez and charm refreshes for enchanters,

What if the enchanter doesn't want them refreshed?  I don't see how
automating those things would be a good idea.

: buff refreshes and

What if the shaman is LOM and doesn't want to refresh the buffs
yet?  I don't see how this would be a good idea, either.

: and ranged attack for rangers (actually, this last one

While I understand the spirit of your message, I think all your
example are stretches.

The feeling I'm getting is the bards are god-like, in the hands
of someone with a great deal of manual dexterity and stamina.

That sounds great for people playing Quake and Unreal, but I'm
not sure if it should be that big of a requirement for people
playing EverQuest.
