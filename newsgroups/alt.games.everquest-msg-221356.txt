Conversely, I played EQ for about a month after it came out, and one of
the main reasons I quit was the frustration of getting from place to
place. At the time, I didn't have hours upon hours to try to get
somewhere. I heard about PoP and decided to give it a whirl, and it's
much more playable now. Unlike some, I don't consider mindless tedium
fun. I don't feel a great sense of accomplishment in getting my sense
heading to 200; it always suprised me that my character couldn't just
buy a fucking compass. Which exist, and are sold on vendors and given as
quest rewards, and do absolutely nothing.

Just because it was fun for you doesn't mean it is fun for everyone. The
addition of PoP means people who do find it fun can do it, people who
don't, don't have to. Why does the fact that you found it fun mean
everyone should have to do it?

Wow, somehow, I just never saw the appeal of spending three weeks
camping something. A thrill to it? Yeah, ok. You may get a thrill out of
watching plants grow, but again, why should every be subjected to such
insane levels of mindless tedium?

And I am willing to bet for every good memory, there are two or three
bad stories or people who cancelled over it. But you don't care about
people who don't like things; since they are different than you, you
WANT them to cancel. In your mind, the only person's fun that matters is
yours... I'm suprised you don't spend more time on PvP servers ganking
newbs.
