Have to agree big time with your statement. Very very often, even when
it appears I'm doing "nothing" I'm doing alot. Talking business or a
friendly gab fest and get interupted with a few tells asking for the X
spell is a major pain in the ass. Worse is getting a tell and the guy
wants me to come to him for me to give him the X spell. A lot of
people don't know all the things a Shaman get for spells, which is
good in a way. However enough figure it out and that's why I travel
anon these days. My totemic armor gives me away also. But you'll find
me very often in the newbie/lowbie zones buffing the daylights out of
em and very often broadcasting with an /ooc message I'm doing just
that. When doing the run between zones in WK I'll go out of my way to
SOW, one very very long run even with it on. Most important to me is
the words please and thank you. If the ty isn't there after a buff
that is asked for  forget getting it again and usaully tell them why.
I don't believe I've asked for more then a couple spells cast on my
chars for the months that I've played and make the run across land
from Qeynos to spires port up take boat get to Freeport/EC I haven't a
clue how many times. Price I pay for not having a portable char. and
I'm too cheap to pay ;-)~ I'll even add that I do alot of business
deals with chars much higher then myself and I have open invites for
ports at all times, I don't take them as a rule, they have other
things to do then port my ass around inspite of their politness. But I
will say what a pleasure it is to hit the unsuspecting newbie/lowbie
with "da book", the remarks they make about have so many buffs is
wonderful, hell even some of the higher ones are taken aback when I'm
not busy and toss the book at em
