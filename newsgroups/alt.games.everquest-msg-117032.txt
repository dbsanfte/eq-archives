No, they're just responding to the common complaint
everyone has about the "outdoors express."   The changes
to Oasis and LoIO have made both zones more difficult than
they were before without totally killing their utility.  Going to
any lower-level dungeon is much better XP now.

So they're making changes that move lower-levels into
level-appropriate dungeons and away from the Oasis to DL
progression.   Who's going to complain about that?
