Best info I have received is that the AC has a 1 in 20 chance of spawning
instead of a Sand Giant, and a Random npc is the Sand Giants PH kill
anything that roams. I don't know how factual this is best I can offer. If
you are able to solo the AC and prevent it from being KSed it might be
quicker to head to Rathe Mts and kill HGs and buy Travelers Boots
