	Right.  Read the news.admin.net-abuse.email newsgroup and you will
see hundreds of lines of text in which the n.a.n-a.e participants claim to
have "killed" a spammer, or claim to have "whacked the spammer's nads with
a mallet," or at the very least claim that they would *like* to kill a
spammer if given half a chance.

	Nobody in the group (so far as I know, mind you) has ever actually
*done* any of these things.  But they talk about it a lot.  So one could
easily cull from n.a.n-a.e several pages of quotes which "prove" that
n.a.n-a.e regulars are a bunch of homicidal maniacs.
