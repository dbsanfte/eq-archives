I did a lot of searching on deja.com (now google) on the topic of how
much xp pets will take when soloing and grouping and it's hard to get
a straight answer.  Everyone seems to differ.  I just started a mage
so I'd really like to know.

When you solo, I've heard people say pets always take 25% (regardless
of anything lese), that they take 50% if they get the killing blow,
and that they always take 50%.  Which is it?

What about in groups?  I've heard that the pet will take 50% if it
gets the killing blow (regardless of group size) otherwise it takes
only a few %.  Is that correct?

   Chris
