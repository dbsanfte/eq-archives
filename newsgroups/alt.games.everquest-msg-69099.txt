None. The planes were actually added quite a while after the game was
out and some people had been level 50 or near for a while. My shaman
was level 32 when they came out and I did not play a whole lot then.

You could also enter the planes BEFORE 47. I ran into them with a
level 1 ogre. My friend who was 50 was in a guild doing the plane of
fear on solusek ro and told me to run in and loot the shaman boots. So
I had shaman fear boots at level 32 ;) I logged off or would have got
arms also = /

There was no sky for quite a long time. Currently the only planes are
fear, hate, sky and the plane of mischief.
