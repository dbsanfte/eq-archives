ROFL, silly necro.  That's alot of deaths in one day.  I'm glad you are a
sport about it.  Most of the time, when I get killed in a group the group
leader gets all bent out of shape about it<Oh, I'm so sorry,I'll make it up
to you, that sort of stuff>. I don't really care if I'm having a good time.
It's all about the fun factor.  If I'm having fun, I don't care if I die 10
times.  Playing in LOIO taught me the differences between good leaders and
bad ones.  A good leader may get you killed but he'll do alot to prevent it
and stick around long enough to make sure everyone has looted their corpses
before the group breaks up.  As a ranger, I have much less HP than the usual
tanks and I don't get healed as much if we have a MT that is a real tank
instead of me. ( I really hate pulling and being MT unless I know the zone
well).  Therefore, I am very used to corpse runs and don't really mind them.
Sometimes running back to the group gives me a chance to think thru what
went wrong and how to make sure it doesn't happen again.

Above all, have fun, if you aint having fun, go spend your money on a trip
to the movies if you can find one for under $10 nowadays(heh).
