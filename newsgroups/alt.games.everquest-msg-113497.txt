First & foremost, ignore all answers that recommend particular race or
class.  You're the one who will more than likely have to live with the
character for at LEAST a year, and I've yet to run into a psychic on this
newsgroup who can tell you what YOU will most enjoy playing. :)

You have 8 character slots...experiment with race/class combos.  Someone
already recommended http://eq.castersrealm.com and that's a good site.
www.allakhazam.com is another.
