Mythic.  Hmmm.

Aliens Online...was very buggy to the end
Splatterball (not SB+, no idea how that is).  Buggy to the very end
Rolemaster: Magestorm.  GREAT game unless the kiddies logged on and
exploited bugs that gave their level 1 character level 12+ spells (the
effect was horrendous).  Unfortunately near the end this was a constant
problem and Mythic had zero intention of doing anything about it.

Mythic doesn't have a great track record.  They come up with great ideas but
they don't run with them.
