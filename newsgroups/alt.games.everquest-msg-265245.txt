I've met a lot of people who play chess, and they all enjoy playing the 
game. I have never met anyone who played chess, and hated it, who called 
it a necessary grind/investment in order for him to one day become the 
world champion, at which point they think it would be fun.

There are a lot of people who play EQ with the mistaken impression that 
the first 69 levels and 200 AA are just the obstacle between them and 
having fun. And that is just stupid.
