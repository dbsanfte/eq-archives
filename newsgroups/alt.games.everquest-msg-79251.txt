I would say Yes, it should be in the FAQ, since it makes such a HUGE 
difference in performance.  Maybe there should be a disclaimer with 
Verants statement too, but based on my performance, the change ranges from 
a small improvement in some zones to an absolutely stunning improvement in 
other zones.  I have not seen any performance degradation, but to be fair 
the only SoL zone I've hunted in since making the change has been Fungus 
Grove.
I'm seeing performance as good or slightly better than what I had before 
SoL came out.
