DAOC looks like another EQ. The biggest difference is its PvP system
which people seem to like.

I would guess DAOC will look most attractive to the following types of
EQ players.

1. People that like EQ-style games, but need a change of pace.
2. People that like PvP, but don't like EQ's PvP implementation.

I personally fit in both catagories so I will try DAOC which I plan to
play about as long as I played EQ or until something better comes
along.

This of course all assumes DAOC doesn't pull a AO. :-)
