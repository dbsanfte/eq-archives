You mean like the crass, unconstructive, snide remarks asking you to stop 
spamming the newsgroup with your URL which leads to a website replete 
with NO cheats, NO codes, and NO music?

Fine.  In all politeness, with no crassness intended, and as constructive 
criticism, may I humbly suggest you a) stop spamming as that could get 
you in trouble with your ISP and kill your webpage before it begins and 
b) perhaps learn that EQ has no 'cheats' and no 'codes' and c) get a 
little further into the game before you start bragging about all those 
big 'secrets' you know.
