A third spell, level 62 Blessing of Reverence, seems to extend the effect
up to 65 spells.

More, for some unknown reason Pie, BOF, and Revereware all stack, so I now
have two utterly useless buffs, ideal for buffing up against a dispelling
mob; put Pie in slot one, BOF in two, and then buff all I like, when we are
finally ready to go, I can kill Pie and put up my spyglass with its
irritating constant refresh set up in my autoclick slot.

Amulet of Insight gives you extended buff duration on all sub-61 spells,
Enshrouded Veil gives 25% reduction to pet casting cost, Supple Scale
Armband extends the range of all sub-61 spells INCLUDING CHeal; all three
are easily available, first two sell very low price while the third drops
like candy in a Hands camp in KC, so go help a bard and monk get their epic
drops and you'll be throwing these away.
