Even if you pay top dollar (100pp for a 10-dose) they only have to
cost you 9pp each.  You can vendor the potion with one hit left in
it for 19pp, netting 9 hits for 81pp.

Jboots are the tool of the devil, I'm tellin' ya.  Jus' you look at all
them evil wizards killin' them poor gnomie guards.  They's aworkin' fer
satan, and that's for shure!  We gots ta get out there and SAVE them
wizards from themselves!  Take off them jboots and jus' throw 'em down
on the groun'.  Throw 'em on the groun' an stomp 'em inta the dust!
Make them jboots rot right down inta hell itself.  Get thee behind me
satan!
