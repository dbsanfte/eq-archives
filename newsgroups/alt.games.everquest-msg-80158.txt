I performed the recommended tasks on the website
> (unstalling cards and all programs, installing Liveware 3.0, then
> installed the Windows XP latest drivers (11/29/01),

Does this restore funtionality to liveware3.0? I have an SBLive! X-Gamer and
XP home and I have the same music problems but I have not installed liveware
3.0 yet as it did not work at all on my old PC usin XP.

Anyone know how to get liveware back? I really loved the soundfont banks for
games that use midi.
