 I don't know if you are kos or not, my gnome agnostic wasn't,I considered
apprehensively
there's a quest to raise faction, in the Northeast area of the zone is a
Sarnak ruins, kill the berserkers,they drop war braids, turn them in to this
skeleton in ot,captain rottgrim I think is the spelling, I'm thinking you
could be invisible to undead maybe and turn them in?  I think you remain
invisible if you hand a npc something?  I don't know test that theory out
give someone something you aren't kos to first :)

took me doing the quest approximately 29 times to be amiable from
apprehensively and I had killed in kc that screwed up my faction there.  At
amiable you can get the worker hammer from the undead foreman that will
transport you to ot from anywhere, just equip the hammer it's all/all and
snack greenies until you gate, you tp to the boat under construction near
the undead foreman. :) hope this helps, maybe there's another way, anything
that's raises venrilSathir
 will help, I found the quest at http://www.graffe.com/   under new worker
quest
