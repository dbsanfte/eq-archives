Long-time employees get raises, and they have a good number of GMs at
the very least that have been around since close to the beginning.

Of course, the price for the hardware has gone down, but that doesn't
offset the fact that they've had to pay to add machines for each of
20+ server farms. They may not be as expensive as they were, say, 5
years ago, but they still aren't cheap. Then there's the cost of
upkeep... Replacing worn parts, upgrading parts, so on. Even if the
cost of buying machines has gone down, they still had to buy it and
it's still more expensive to run 20+ farms of, say, 5 machines each
than 20+ farms of 4.

What's unbeleivable is that you're dismissing this so easily and
completely.

Gotta remember this is California, too. ;-p

Cite. C'mon, if people want me to cite, then they should do the same.

Not saying that their profits didn't increase from the rate hike, just
that it's not anywhere near as dramatic as the "evil corperation
bashers" want to beleive.
