Nope, the Cancel Magic line works from the top down
*when you cast it on yourself which is what the OP
asked about.   So, yes, you can cast a junk buff on
yourself, cast your good buffs, and click off the
junk buff to give a slot for any NPC spells you can
dispell to go into.

It's fairly easy to test and it's worked that way
since my cleric was 14...
