There was a nasty virus named Nimda that made Code Red look like an amatuer
one. It attacked
through ISP's, web pages, and email. Your DNS or ISP could have gotten hit,
mine did. 24 hours
of no access and they had me back up and running. Check www.sarc.com for
info. It might actually
be that Verant wasn't guilty THIS time. ;-)  Then again, it is totally
possible that aliens from the planet
GreighNak abducted your bandwidth.

Have a nice day.
