Um...Jak...PLAY YOUR MONK!!!

You already level so fast that I can't keep up!  Put that fat ass troll on
the back burner for a few weeks and come have some fun with us lowbies!

of course, you monk is falling behind tiru's cleric so you have yourself in
a pickle.  But, I'd take a higher cleric anyday.

J/K - you play however you like and I really don't have any good advice for
your current combo. good luck
