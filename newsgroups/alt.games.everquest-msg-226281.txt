Exactly. If you had an opportunity to sell more of a product to people
via a method that they're perfectly willing to buy it, didn't cost you
so much that you wouldn't be making a profit off the sales still, and
doesn't involve lying to them in any way, shape, or form, it would be
stupid not to take advantage of it. Especially in a situation such as
this, where those who don't take advantage of the offer are completely
and totally unaffected.

All this bitching is just sour grapes, nothing more. It's pathetic and
childish. "WAHHH! They aren't giving away guaranteed beta spots to
everyone for free! I have to buy something for that!"
