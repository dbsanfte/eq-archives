Not freezing the package makes external dye a much more viable option.

Anywhere with a backing department.  Dunno about smell, but a whole 
bottle cost less than two bucks, the TV dinner you're wrecking will cost 
you more than that but you can buy two and test it out on one.  And 
still have enough alum for another 30 dinners.

Well, if humiliation is the goal there's little point, but if finding 
the culprit is the goal, the advantage of an invisible dye is that the 
person won't know they've been tagged, so they won't go into your 
solvent rich environment and remove the tag.  You can rig up a UV lamp 
with a clip light and a UV bulb, and use it to play find the weasel. 
This is probably a $50 solution, though, and if you're looking at a 
large employee base, one that admittedly be hard to implement.

Thats no scientific attitude... I can think of one volunteer that is 
neither Lenny nor the cats.  Pick a less embarassing color, I'm thinking 
the red, and have a pleasant dinner.  After, you can experiment with 
removal methods, I'm thinking baking soda, failing that a high alcohol 
content beverage.  Your culprit, meantime, may not even notice he's been 
tagged, and even if he does, won't likely have immediate access to any 
serious solutions.  Plus, a color like blue or purple or green will be 
more noticable and embarassing than the slightly redder mouth you might 
be sporting.

Something to consider; how often is it =your= lunch thats being hit? 
This is going to be an annoying project if it means making a fresh 
dinner each day for weeks on end till you finally get a nibble.  And 
meantime what do -you- eat?
