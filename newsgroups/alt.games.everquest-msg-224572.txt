Just curious, who are the people you're referring to?  If you'd rather not
post here, that's fine, you can get me by mail.  Just take the "spamaway"
out from in front of the "redstarsector" on my mail.  I know a number of
ex-Vae casually within game, and am friends with a couple.  One especially I
just can't see being shitty like that.

(I'm not defending Vae overall.  Any time you get a guild that big and
massive, you're going to get assholes.  I'm just surprised that the
*officers* were acting like that.)
