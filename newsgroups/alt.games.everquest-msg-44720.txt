If you use /say you sharply limit the range of your message... I've never used
it
much at all, since I'm not sure -how- sharply.  Will everyone in range of
my target "hear" me?  Not in heal range of me, mind you, but up to twice
that far away, more really, as a healer may be out of heal range of my target
but trying to move close enough to get that heal in.  /ooc will reach everyone
in the zone, no matter what... so belt and suspenders thinking (read Dwarven
thinking) suggests using that unless its proven that /say will really get the
job done just as well 100% of the time.

/ooc heal is part of "general communication", don't you think?

I've never seen /assist heal requested other than on a raid.  Normally healing
your own group members and perhaps occaisionally the main tank in a small
raid if he isn't in your group is all that a cleric is responsible for.

I also suggested that this raid hotkey setup be seperate from your normal
grouping hotkey setup.  If you are in a group, heal announcements should
be confined to /groupsay, not blathered about even in /say

If you are in a zone where /ooc heal announcements are going on, you
understand that there is a raid of some sort on, and either put up with it
or filter the /ooc channel; having the channel to chatter about the latest
Friends episode is convenient, but doesn't take priority over real tactical
needs of people playing the game.

When more than one raid is going on, usually the various channels are
split up amongst them, one taking /ooc, another /shout, and even /auction;
everyone in each raid can then filter the other raids out.
