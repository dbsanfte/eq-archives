Nah occasionally there'll be one at the entrance that has it...I used to xp
at the entrance.   LOL West almost totally wiped an xp group (I had to keep
4 mezzed for about 10 minutes while we did rezzes of 3 bodies) thanks to one

But I guess you're right...keeping up cold resist for a POSSIBLE in the
entrance is a bit much.
