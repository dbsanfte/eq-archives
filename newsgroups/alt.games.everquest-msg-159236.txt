}So yes that con be done =)

Ooh, reminds me of another odd bug I saw the other day.  I created a Kitty 
bard and got her up to level 6 so I could beat up Shainai repeatedly and 
get all my alts her nightie.  (BTW, it looks to be about a 100 point 
faction hit, it was 17 killsish from low ally to KoS).  But the first time
I successfully offed her, I logged my wizard in on thoe other comp to 
loot, ran over there, and she was still alive with one bubb of health...  
wtf?  Looked back at the bard screen, Hail Shainai's corpse, look at the 
wizzy screen, Hail Shainai.  Esc and /assist the bard, now targetting 
Shainai.  Bard Esc and /ass the wizzie, Now targetting corpse.  So I 
logged in yet another character, who properly saw her as dead, and the 
wizzie had to go to the back of the line.

My guess is this is conclusive proof that Shainai's father's name was 
Schrodinger.

Oh, and she was level 9-10, had about 100 hp, and 10hp/tic regen.  And she 
wouldn't stay mad at me.  I'd hit her, and she'd keep walking.  Had to 
hail her repeatedly to get her to stay still.  She never once hit back, 
and I never got any skill ups off her, even when she was red to me.  Good 
exp tho, 17 kills got me to level 8.  Now I wonder what her silly stick is 
for?
