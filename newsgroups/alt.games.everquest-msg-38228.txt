I don't recall seeing articles about EQ being free now written up on
Everlore, Caster's Realm, etc. Nor do I recall the fake "uber items"
making it there.

Because removal couldn't be done without a complete player wipe, thus
a work-around was put in.

Your point? They said at one time that they'd never be shown at all...

Odd, I seem to recall them saying several times that it'd never be
done. I *DON'T* recall them saying it would be even considered until
they announced the service.

>You can't base anything on that shit.

No less than you can base anything on the fact they said it'd never be
done...
