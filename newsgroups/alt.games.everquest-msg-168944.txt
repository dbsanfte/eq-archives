If you have Windows XP, I would suggest... err, updating your drivers :)
Seriously, try removing your mouse in your hardware manager and reinstall it
using the applicable driver packaged with Windows XP (if there's no driver
for your specific mouse, there will be a standard driver that should work
fine).  If you have a different version of Windows I would try the same
thing but would not be so sure it'll fix the problem.
