Well, I have heard (I don't know from experience) that the higher
caster-type staves are 1hb for the most part.  I am a level 10 Magician
and just recently switched to 1hb from 2hb.  I have a nice staff with a
proc (just in case hand to hand becomes necessary to save my pet).
It's better than the 2hb staff I was using (lower damage, but higher
speed), magic, and has a proc), and I can now use something in my other
hand (I hold a skull which gives me mana, currently).

I started with 2hb because I figured that they would be better weapons
(being larger).  In reality, for casters it's all about the bonuses
your weapon gives you, not the damage it deals (you won't melee much,
if ever at medium to high levels).  Bonuses can be gotten from 1hb
weapons just fine.

Maybe a more experienced caster can tell you more about high level
staves and 1hb vs 2hb.  But I've always heard that 1hb is better in the
long run for the reasons stated above.  You could do some searching on
some EQ sites for high level 1hb and 2hb weapons for your class and see
what turns up and decide for yourself.  Just make sure you also check
out held items to see if those appeal to you as well before deciding,
since with a 1hb you get to use those too.
