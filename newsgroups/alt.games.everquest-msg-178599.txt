Rain spells can deal the killing blow, however they do seem
to be oddly predisposed to have the last wave resisted when
it would deal the killing blow.  Nevertheless, it does occur with
some (rare) frequency on my 52 wizard whose use of the 52
rain is prolific.  In fact, I've found it's very useful for dealing with
spectral callers and their pets in KC, particularly as the pet
doesn't count in the wave count.  2 hits on the pet kills it, and 3
on the caller does a potential 3k damage on one cast. Of
course, it's not often I get all 3 hits to stick on the caller and it's
quite often that the pet gets pulled out of the area of effect
before the second hit.
