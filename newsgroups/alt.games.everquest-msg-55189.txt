There was a red sky in WC last night too?  Heard a bunch of shouts in EC and
went to check it out.  Werewolfs everywhere.  Only level 11 so I couldn't
kill the big ones only the Minor Werewolfs.  Didn't drop anything
spectacular though, only money on the ones I killed.  It lasted about 30 min
or so.
