Ah!  That explains a lot.  Met it with a level 19 or so Paladin and as
it ws down at 52% health and no one was around fighting it (thought
there might be a dotter hiding around somewhere!) I thought  "Aha !
Easy experience".

A little while into the fight and I was getting slightly chewed (AC is
a bit twinked).  It's hitpoints seemed to have barely changed.

Decided to make a strategic retreat !

Cheers.
