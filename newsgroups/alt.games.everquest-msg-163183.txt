I know what you are talking about. There is a place in Paludal Caverns
like that. You stand in one spot with spawns going off all around you,
including one close enough to touch,  and cast DoTs and DDs all day
long and they just stand and look at you til they fall over dead.  If
you get C3 first, with the exp bonus that comes with Pauldal,  you can
level from 19 to 24 faster than anything I've ever seen.
