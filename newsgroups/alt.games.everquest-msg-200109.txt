Try Nadox and Hates Fury.

Assorted reasonably nice drops in Nadox, including the Coral Ring which
has nice stats and drops off what are, for Nadox, trash MOBs. Hates Fury
also has some very nice items drop - we had a Great Maul of Hatred drop
from a trash MOB there, group at the time was 61 chanter + 61 rogue +
58 cleric as I recall. As well as another decent item off a named MOB
that we came within a hair of taking down with the same trio. (Only
failed because I let the rogue's HP drop to a point where I had to spam
small heals to keep him alive, which drained my mana dry.)

Dulak is also decent from what I've seen - many MOBs drop cash gems
(including blue diamonds, for example) and reasonable stat gear.

I don't know about the Torgiran Mines, never been there.

The main problem with Hates Fury is getting there... the pier leading
to the zone is mostly undead, but with one live MOB that makes using
IVU impractical. Pacifying past them all might work though.
