Woody's post says nothing ... absolutely nothing other than the fact he
may now be an EQ fanboi.

The simple fact of the matter is that they broke into groups which
included GM's and devs.  The class reps (web site owners) gave lists to
the devs of things that needed immediate fixing .. oh no not another
list ... a la the SOE forums.  We can kiss those lists goodbye.

Nothing has or will be changed by this forum .. SOE asked the wrong
people ... A list has been made of high end changes which do not help
the general player base ... as I said the game is dying too fast for a
rez .. I am afraid.
