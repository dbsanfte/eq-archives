I prefer Fishing; you only have to buy a fishing pole and some bait. The pole
will break eventually, though. Fishing skill goes up pretty fast, too. You'll
more than likely get , Fish Scales, Rusty Daggers or Tattered Sandals instead
of Fresh Fish at first, but you can still sell them. As for the Fresh
Fish....either use them for Baking or sell them to vendors or other players.
Fish Scales are a spell component, so you can probably sell them to casters.

(My Level 14 Necro has invested exactly 1 training toint and about 2 hours of
time in Fishing, and has a skill in the mid-30's)
