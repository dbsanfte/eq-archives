Zebuxorok:
Dark Horizon
Knights of Eternal Good

Both work in friendly rivalry and it's hard to tell who's more 'uber' DH
have downed Yelinak a few times, but KeG hasn't tried yet. KeG has
downed Solantek but DH hasn't tried. Both are making raids in Sleepers,
some joint raids there too. AFAIK there hasn't been a single raid clash
on Zeb. A world away from E'Ci where we moved from LOL

E'Ci:
Vane

Asian guild leagues ahead of anyone else still on the server
-- 
Demorgoth Demonia
Ogre Warlord
Souls of the Sha...
erm... Nights Wa... Dark Horizon!
E'ci erm... ZubZub server!
