That's one theory... another is
Putting Loser on Notification: Killfiled

And there are still more, and some think that the acronyms have been 
retrofitted onto the word, not the word from the acronym.

The difference is plonking someone -tells- them they've been put in the 
killfile, while killfiling is just a case of doing it.

Is it splitting hairs? Maybe... I suppose there are some people who 
plonk by making a post that says 'killfiled' instead of 'plonk' that 
greys the issue.

And there are some people who post a plonk, but don't actually killfile 
him. (ie they want to end the conversation, plan not to talk to the 
asshat again, but don't want to be completely oblivious to anything he 
might say going forward.
