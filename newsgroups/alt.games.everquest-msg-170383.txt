I died in WL when my pc locked up (win xp and ctl alt del wouldn't even
work!). No idea what killed me or where i was when i died, but i woke up
naked and mad. No problemo, i though, and pulled out a bone chipped rod,
stuck it on my alt, and had him run around... used all the charges and no
sign of it, couldn't figure that out, and what's worse, i suddenly got the
message "you have no corpse in zone" every time /cor hotkey was hit.

I checked everything was right, and gave up, especially as my alt was being
pummelled by hordes of green mobs (huge aggro, can't see because of trees
and invisible or casting mobs, what fun, and no xp if you kill them.)

Could not find a necro who would summon corpse within the time of
resurrection, and i felt that special feeling losing a heap of xp can give
you.

A friendly high level rogue turned up, and i grabbed 4 bone chipped rods and
handed them to her. She had a go and had the same problem. WTF? She
suggested it might be up a tree or underground and that i should petition.
She said it had to be in a certain area due to triangulation, but there was
just nothing in sight. Anyway I stood at the spot and typed /cor, and it
appeared; i presume my linkdead self decided climbing a tree was a nifty
little trick but illl never know for sure. I looted up while the rogue
killed these stupid adds (no loot, no xp, just there to annoy you) and vowed
to avoid that zone from then on.

Do gm's ever return xp in those situations? Do they even have an option once
the body is looted?

Last time I had this much trouble was when i got wedged standing up with a
non casting character in Paw in the middle of a wall; couldn't get out, and
couldn't stay online for a gm to pull me out, and couldn't get someone to
port me out.... very bad situation. Finally someone leved me and i walked
'above' the celing to the zone line.
