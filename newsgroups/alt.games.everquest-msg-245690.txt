	This is exactly what was done in the most recent revisions.  Top-end loot is 
in the form of schematics, sometimes with rare components obtained from 
adventuring, to be turned into items by crafters.  Predictably, this has 
pleased no one.

	The adventurers are unhappy because they slog through murderous content like 
the Corellian Corvette (though I understand it's been finessed now), and they 
don't get something they can use.  They have to go find a Master Whoever to 
actually get their loot, and pray they don't get ripped off.

	The crafters are unhappy because they are being used as butt monkeys by the 
adventurers.  Their contribution to the process is gratuitous and perfunctory, 
and they know it.  Plus, the loot items devalue the "ordinary" products they 
can make.

	The adventurers just want their frigging loot.  The crafters don't want to be 
used as vending machines and would rather the stuff didn't exist in any case. 
  As usual, a system that attempts to be all things to all people ends up 
being nothing to anyone.
