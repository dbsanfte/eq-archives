Remove listless power unless you're soloing. In a full group, the effects
are not needed and your mana is. Good for pet soloing tho, although I
usually don't bother with it. YMMV.

Remove Curse of the Simple Mind. It's also fairly useless in full group
situations. (great for PvP tho ;-)

Clarity is an "as needed" buff. It shouldn't be mem'd constantly. 

What -SHOULD- be in that list and isn't is your Color series. Why on earth
are you even stepping out of your home city without at least Color Shift
(lvl 20) loaded? That's a 6 second stun that can effect an unlimited
number of mobs. You get agro'd, color shift, then mez. The color line of
spells will save your life, I guarantee it. Use them.

So, if the above list were me:

1. Alacrity (Tanks needs refreshing too often to unload it)
2. Enthrall
3. AOE Mez
4. Color Shift
5. Chaos Flux (nuke)
6. Tepid Deeds
7. Enstill
8. Tashani

This has been a tried and true spell line up for me for a long long
time. (Through all the various spell ranks) Keeping a nuke loaded is
optional. During a group situation I consider that my "swap" slot for
refreshing buffs etc.

http://eq.castersrealm.com/ should be your next stop then. Enstill is an
upgrade to Root, and you could have bought it at just about any Cleric or
Shaman guild. The only spell you have to research at 29 is Feedback.
(Damage shield)

> Secondly, which is the best mez, Mez or Enthrall?

Enthrall hands down. It has a hate-list reduction component and it lasts
longer. Now that you have clarity, you can -almost- med up the entire cost
of the spell in the amount of time it lasts. The hate reducer is just
gravy.  I've -never- had a mob agro on me after having been Enthralled.
That may just be luck tho, as they usually blitz after the healers if they
were healing anyone during the period the mob was mez'd.

Start shooting for that 200 mark. Specific items? Can't really help you,
since I'm wearing pretty much the same thing you are. (Oracle Robe and a
mish-mash of raw silk and some specific magic items picked up
here-n-there) Try Allakhazam for making your next shopping / hunting list.

> Also, where to hunt next after I get done with High Keep?

Actually, since you're going shopping anyway, you might want to go solo
the Ancient Croc in upper Guk. Very nice exp, and excellent drops. (See
list of goodies on Allakhazam) Long respawn wait of about 15 minutes makes
it boring though. If you want to know where to group, that's easy.

/who all encha 27 34
/who all cleri 27 34

That should tell you where the chanters are (and consequently, where you
might want to be, or avoid, as the case may be), and where the clerics
are. I dunno about you, but if there's no cleric there's no sense in you
getting involved with them.
