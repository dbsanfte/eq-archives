I do this maybe once a month and start off by backing up things like my MP3
files and more specifically for Everquest, the .opt files I believe and
*all* files that start with character names.  Oh, and I suppose I always
throw in eqclient.ini while I'm at it, but that's it.  Clean install, patch
up and restore back those several files I'm back exactly where I was before,
friends list, ignore list - all intact.
