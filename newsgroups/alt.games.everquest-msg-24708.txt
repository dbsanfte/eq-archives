Hmm... I experimented with that two days ago, because I thought it was 
105, too.  But Fire Emeralds went down in price when I increased my 
Charisma from 110ish to 120ish.  It did not go down again above that, but 
I only tested up to 160ish.

For an enchanter twink, though, there's still the (unproven either way) 
theory that high CHA helps with charming and mezzing.  The only 
experimental data I've seen compared 170ish with 120ish.  It showed a 
small gain.  Alas, this tells us nothing about where any set points may 
be, nor was the data set large enough to be really statistically 
significant...
