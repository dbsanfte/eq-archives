    But you can see Dennis's point, though: being ganked, totally
overwhelmed from out of nowhere, isn't fun. There's no strategy, no
thinking, you just die or flee and pray. Being a ganker is only marginally
fun (unless you enjoy grief) - you plan the ambush or gather your forces,
but then you steamroll your opponents without challenge. In PvP or RvR, the
victory conditions are winning the fight - and the fights are as slanted as
one side can make it. Even in highly biased war simulation games, the
victory conditions are based around the expected outcome - if your Taliban
forces can hold Kandahar until turn 10, you achieve victory! PvP doesn't
have victory conditions tailored to the situation.

    Having said that, I'm not sure all servers for DAoC will be as slanted
as Merlin was. Individual PvP fights may be as bad as ever, but the actual
RvR looks like it could be neat (barring an entire server of catass players
like on Merlin, though).
