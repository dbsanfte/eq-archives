Absolutely correct.

How about 

/lang 1
/g This is human
/lang 2
/g this is elf
/lang 3

then a second one that does:

/g this is Teir Dal
/lang 4
/g This is halfling
/lang 1

Then just do them in order (1, then 2 or whatever you put them on). Clunky 
but workable.

Wouldn't /dosocial 1.1 be an assload of fun?
