Not really. The true ubers can afford to buy ridiculous items like
funghi tunics, cloak of flames and PoP weaponry for their twinks. The
true newbie player does not have the 100K+ that requires and can get
something decent but not imbalancing at the bazaar. This allows them
to at least play in the same ballpark as the "average" player at their
level. It certainly doesn't make them invulnerable. It does make the
early stages of the game easier but thats fine because it's not where
the main population of the game is.

You could rigidly level limit items of course. Don't use item
decay because that just pisses off your player base. EQ has made
some moves in this direction. They haven't been brave enough to
level limit the funghi though.

Then again perhaps this intentional? The ability to play twinked
alts may well be one reason their population has remained so
durable. A lot of the weapons dropping Dulak had "twink weapon"
written all over them.

Oh, EQ is still plenty addictive. And some of the improvements
for new characters are superb. A fresh set of newbie quests generating
armor that would have been mid-game not so long ago. Made a new iksar
beastlord and chased rats in cabilis, a new safe mob for newbies. Then
my guildleader gave me a progressive set of quests to gain armor and
weapons. Actually rather fun. They've even cheated by making a lot of
the new mobs not-assist.

The real fact is that large sections of the world are obsolete, they've
fallen behind the games balance of power, the expectation of what a
character should be equipped with at any given level. Either SoE should
never have allowed item inflation to sell new expansions (hahaha) or
they do have to consider re-jigging the risk / reward of dungeons.

The end result is that EQ is a mature game. The majority of the
player population is of a high level (on their main at least) and
well equipped. The best thing for EQ is to get a true newbie upto
the level of the game population. They will miss out on the EQ
experience of 2 years ago, which is a shame, but unavoidable in the
present design.
