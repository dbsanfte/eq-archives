Our server has all but 2 of the old world planes on a rotation system.  I'd 
like to take a group up to check one out.  This will probably be a 6-man 
group, but we may take up to 12.

Group will at a minimum be me as the chanter, 52 or 58 CLC, 55 RNG, 53+ 
Pally, 53+ DRD, 54 Wiz, and either another 53+ Pally or a 60 RNG.

I know zilch about the planes, including where the "entry" point is 
located, what the "componant" for the spell is, etc.

What old-world plane would be best for a group of 6+ to hit just to do it?  
All 6+ people will be good players who act well as a coordinate group and 
can follow whatever tactic that is required at the moment.

Once I figger out which one we want to try, I'll start researching the 
break-ins, etc.  The 2 Planes that aren't on a rotation are Mischief and 
Growth, I believe.  Is Growth a bad faction hit for Tunare or something?  
Is there any reason to hit Mischief?  These would be the easiest, as we 
wouldn't have to worry about rotations.
