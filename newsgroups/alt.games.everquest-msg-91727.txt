I find EQMaps to be worth it.  I really like their item searches and so
forth.  Which is what I use them for, more than for their maps.  I don't use
EqPrices as much, although since they're starting to fix their prices I may
use them more.  And it's only like 12.95 a year or something like that.  So
isn't that much of a thing.
