I'm about to join a guild that doesn't allow evil races in it.  They're a
role-playing guild and from one standpoint it makes sense.  However, as I
have a real life friend as one of the guild's officers, I know guild members
have argued about this point over and over and it has gotten quite heated
twice.  I won't go into the inter-guild debate, but it did get me to think
about evil and good races in EQ.

First, you cannot be evil in EQ.  If I was truly evil, I would train
monsters to those AFK at the zone line, kill still, sneak and pickpocket
them, camp their city's banker (so none can bank there), etc.  However, you
do any of these (repeatedly and intentionally) and Verant bans you from the
game.

Second, I've never met an evil player yet.  I've met TONS of idiots and
jerks, but not someone who was really evil.  All players play nice
regardless what race they play.  Part of the reason is the paragraph above.
Most of the reason is simply people are nice in general.

Third, I've only seen players who try to role-play their character as an
evil character get flak from other players.  Clerics who refuse to raise an
evil race character simply on the grounds that the character is evil get
MAJOR flak from a zone.

However, why can't we have a server that is a good vs. evil server?  Here's
my idea:

The server would be different in the following ways:

1) Limited PvP.  Good character players can kill evil character players and
vice versa.  Good character players cannot kill good characters without
going the /duel route.  Same for evil character players.

2) Good character Player Characters (PC) cannot group with evil character
PCs.

3) Beneficial spells cannot be cast on a PC of your opposite alignment.  The
spell either doesn't take or does the opposite (heal spell does damage).

4) Guilds cannot have opposite alignment characters than that of the guild's
founder.

5) Faction bonus occurs if you buff and/or heal a NPC when they're attacked
by an opposite aligned PC.  Same happens if you assist (using the /assist
command) the NPC against an opposite aligned PC.  The bonuses only happen if
the NPC wins the fight ... in other words, kills the PC.

6) Make druids neutral.  Druids in many role-playing systems have a neutral
alignment.  In EQ, this would also enable druids to still be everyone's taxi
service.  I'd change however their faction system in that they must keep
their factions neutral.  They party with evil characters too much thus get
too much of a evil faction and the druid starts losing skill levels in
everything.  A slow loss but still a loss as soon as their faction moves out
of the neutral category.  Thus druids would have to evenly group with both
good and evil races for the most part.

Well, what do you think?  Thoughts.  Comments.  Criticisms.  Suggestions.

Toying with an idea,
Scott Jensen
