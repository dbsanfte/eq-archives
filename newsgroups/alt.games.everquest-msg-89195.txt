Fish and batwing will probably fail if your baking is still in your 30's.

However you could try batwings and frosting til mid 40's.

Then fish and  jug of sauces until low 80's.

Both frosting and J.O.S are just as easy to get hold of as fish and batwings,
plus you get the benefit of getting at least some of your money back in
re-sales.
