Cast 7 times, never got a resist.  62 mage.

Having said that, it's still not worth it in the long run, as long as
people know how to manage those rock mobs if you're doing the mez approach.

Done the trials with a 62 mage and 65 wizard, and not being able to banish
the grabbers didn't really make that much difference.  In theory, it should
reduce the mana used by the other spell-DPS group members, but with bot9,
SP, Tranq, Rods + class mana regen, mana is sometimes tight, but never a
killer.
