I disagree.  I think they haven't bothered because they have no need
to build a force and can therefore put their economic efforts
elsewhere.  They are a strategic US ally and as such are better
covered by that than by whatever force they would muster.  Not that
they aren't capable, just that after the mandate was imposed they
discovered that they had alot more resources to direct where they
wanted and didn;t have to spend billions on a military, not when we
would do it for them.
