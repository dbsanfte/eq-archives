Oh, you are full of shit. But no one argued with the point that there
would be re-patches. Don't have to be an "insider" to know that.
Frankly, if you expect us to just "take your word for it" that you're
an "insider", you're a bigger moron than I thought possible. You've
provided no information that anyone who's played the game for more
than a couple months doesn't already know. You've provided nothing to
lead us to beleive you're anything more than a bored, pathetic little
nancy-boy troll suffering dellusions of grandeur.
