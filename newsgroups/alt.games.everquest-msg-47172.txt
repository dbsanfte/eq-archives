Ok... where the fuck does this joker hang out? We didn't have long to
play in Trak last night, but figured we'd at least get our Seb keys
before logging. Our Druid tracked down and dragged back more than a
dozen Hunters, (along with a couple interesting and amusing trains of
various other disgruntled froggied) but didn't pick up the Forager once.
Where should we be looking?
