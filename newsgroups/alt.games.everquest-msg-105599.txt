Ok, what I wanted to know is if by say, putting a level 20 bard (mana
song) in group with a level 47 spellcaster, would the level 47 get
less exp because the level 20 is in the group?  I understand that the
level 20 won't get any exp.  When I've tried this, it seemed the
higher level got less than if just soloing but it's hard to tell with
the random level variation in the kind of mob I was fighting.
