I just attempted to do a transfer but got denied...it took about 2 days. 
It got denied because one account had one less expansion...should have 
paid better attention as I didn't notice the rule about that. When I 
originally transfered my character to another account so I could 2 box 
it took less than a week total to go through, now I just want one 
account so figured I would move him back. BTW both were always my accounts.
