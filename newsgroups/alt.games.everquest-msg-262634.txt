Noooooo... Not Vogon Poetry, next thing you know you'll be forcing us to eat 
cake in a dark booth,
And as for the incredibly dull troll making the original post, Seek help, 
you obviously have no clue about any religion, let alone one based on the 
good Lord's teaching. I feel for you really, it must be awful lonely living 
in your mother's basement going through 3 bottles of jergens a night, while 
trolling through random newsgroups spewing trash in hopes of feeling 
important. The good news is that at least you're literate enough to use a 
computer, so use it to find help.
