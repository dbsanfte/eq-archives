Depends on whether you're easily amused by cross-posted bickering
between otherwise semi-rational people, triggered by a post from
a troll/stalker who haunts the other group.  I was thinking of
tossing in a "don't you people have anything better to do with
your time?" just for giggles.  But, seeing as we're talking about
a pair of usenet groups devoted to gaming, it's pretty much a
given that the posters really don't care about that question.
