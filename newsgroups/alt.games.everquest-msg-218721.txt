*grin*

I like it.  Gets a few /tells out of the blue just as my main has for
4 years which to me is a definition of success. ;)

Went with Ring of Hardened Ash, see what you think.  Magelo updated.

I 2-box a little when absolutely nothing else is going on but it's not
fun and it's not a big issue.  Got about 12k left so I'll bow to
public opinion and get a vanilla Drogmor I think.

Bloodmetal earring is 18-25k on Bristlebane so I won't be buying one
of those anytime soon.  I got a pair of the bracers (I think).
Replaced the Sta heavy boots and got a new mask as suggested by
another poster.

Don't have a guild anymore but that's another story.  Replaced the
legacy haste belt (go go Ranger hand-me-downs) with a Buckled Shale
Belt, still got a little growing into it to do but it's decent.

I don't have PE - haven't even updated my spells on Magelo - not even
bought Bane of Nife yet as I saw it for 1500pp once and didn't buy it
then as I couldn't scribe and now it's always more expensive.  Gah.
