	AFAIK, my guild has yet to get one group past the trials.  We simply do
not have the DPS.  I can think of two people in the guild with a post-epic
weapon and neither is spectacular.  (I have a Steel Hilted Flint Dagger that
could unleash some serious carnage in the off-hand, if I could replace the
haste, but I can't.)

	I've heard about the bonanza, but I simply can't get there, and even if I
could I'd never get into a group.  There are always more people LFG than there
are spaces in groups -- we have too many second-stringer classes (like
Rangers) and not enough plate tanks (esp. Warriors) and Clerics to build
groups around.  If I lose my ability to solo, I lose my ability to gain
experience.
