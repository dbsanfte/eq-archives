Hm. I'm only superficially following this thread, but... Aren't you the 
one arguing for an alteration of the game as it stands right now? 
Apparently, the people you disagree with are the ones happy with the 
status quo.

Well, in the immortal words of The Dude, "That's, like, your opinion, no?
". Ultimately, this is a decision for the designers of the game, and 
even if they were to disable high-level buffs on low-level characters (
something with which I agree, by the way), they are taking steps to 
formalize twinking (with the account-wide bank slots, for example). That 
pretty much implies that, if you have done it the hard way once, you are 
entitled to take shortcuts from there on. Given the amount of tedium 
involved in getting to the high levels (which you'll get to experience 
in due time), I can't say I disagree.
