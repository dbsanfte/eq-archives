with a well timed evade by a rogue, about all that is usually missed damage wise
is one attack cycle, they are still dealing max or near max damage.  If the
Rogue doesn't know how to evade well, or has tanks that aren't able to taunt
well, then yes the rogue will start to drop like a fly, and become a mana
sponge, however a properly equipped rogue knows that AC is god for all Melee
classes, just like it is for the true Tank classes, and can actually take a hit
or two without dropping.  While str makes a little more difference in the rogues
damage output than it does for warriors etc.  NEVER should str equipment be
sought over AC.  or the  goofy stats that Verants says are important, dex and
agility.  I am not sure who should wear a serpentine bracer (if anyone) but it
sure as hell is not a rogue or a monk, two classes that when people thought
stats mattered, were always told get a serp bracer for the dex and agility.
