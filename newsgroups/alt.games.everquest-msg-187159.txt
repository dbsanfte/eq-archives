Unbelievable, Getting to 50 in such short order I can understand. But 50 -
60....Was that all done in PoP zones?
I took a Shaman to 30 in as many hours played, I slowed at that point as I
stopped the power levelling and started to work on skills and faction and
basically learn to play the character. I was trying to do something similar
with a paladin but as a melee I am finding skills are a problem and the
progress is far slower than that of my Shaman, did you not have this
problem?
