Firstly

I have heard of these " geerlok" things, and assume I am correct in thinking
they are added to containers while tradskills are practised??

But can someone please tell me,
1.  are they a purchased item from vendors?
2.  are they an item that I need to manufacture myself?
3.  are there specific ones for each tradeskill?
4. and do they return after each combine regardless of success?

I have broken 100 in Brewing, Baking, Tailoring and Smithing. And my Fletch
currently stands at 182. And if these things were to add to my succes rate I
would be most grateful! As indeed my  finger and wrist would!

Secondly

Am I correct in thinking that the tradeskills will cap at 200, except for
the first which passes 200? If so, as a Lvl  39 Halfling Paladin, which
skill should I take above 200, and for what reasons??

Loosely based on the following

Profitability?
Items?
Sense of achievent?
Difficulty in material collection?

I know its a long winded Email, but If you dont ask....

Thank you for any input.
