They patched the limit on bind wound for warriors (and I assume other
melee's) a while back, it was limited to 100. At 50th my Warrior has a skill
of 175 and it's been that way for 10 levels (Was high 30's when they did
that patch so although I should have capped it at 35 it was still 100 at
39th)
I am not certain that when I hit 51 I'll be able to bind over 200 at
all...any 51+ Warriors want to confirm this (I am only dubious as the
current cap is not 200 like my other skills)
