I think that is just a fluke. I did a test recently when someone
though agil affected run speed.

Human paladin or something with 75 agil

Half elf bard with 125 agil

On the same run from just starting up in wk (where you zone in from
qey hills) To just past that guy for the ghoulbane quest along shore
near the zone to NK, it took:

Human paladin 11 minutes 17 seconds

Half elf bard 11 minutes 18 seconds

I think what is happening in this case, and many other posters cases
is that you are getting graphically lagged. This especially happens
post luclin for me, when someone new enters the zone. In the case
above it just happened that I had a slight pause on BOTH characters
when someone entered the zone. 

I made several other types and all level one character types,
regardless of stats, class, or race, all  run at the exact same speed
and take the same amount of time to cover a distance.

Your 16 second difference might be accounted for by some factor having
to do with you stopping the timer upon zoning (it can give kind of  a
pause now before saying it where you  keep moving, or not) If you
instead, as I did, used two landmarks in a large zone along a trail or
straight path (like the shore in west karana) I bet your times will be
about the same.
