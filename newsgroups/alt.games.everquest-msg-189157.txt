Dick,

You have to give us more information to help you.

The comment of killing rats is very good.  Get just three plauge rat tails,
sell them to a friendly
vendor, and you just about have all of your patchwork armor.

There is also a philosophical question on how you want to manage your
leveling.
As an example, my first chacacter, a warrior, only skilled in 1 and 2 hd
slash.
He has feeble skills in hand to hand, piercing, blunt (one or two).  Now he
is faced with
the daunting task of using these feeble skills against much higher mobs to
get points
in those, while taking a beating.  Raise your skills, all of them, as evenly
as possible
with the lower level animals, skellies, etc.  Orc pawns get you cloth armor.

Once you get enough set up for patch work, start brewing, and start making
heady kiolas.
They sell for between 1 and 4pp with an /auction or for about 5-7pp in the
bazaar. Routinely.

Auction your pelts, and don't just take 1-2pp for them.  I will almost
always pay 10-12pp
per pelt for any quality, HQ bear I will almost always offer 20pp.  They
sell for double in
the bazaar, but I make them into backpacks with a 10% fail rate, and those
always sell well.

Off track.  the BEST method to get money is the tried and true, level level
level.  The higher you
level, the faster the larger money drops.  I routienly go to kill the four
guards at the netukos forest
bridge with the help of a buddy or two, and we split the loot, and swords.

Evil characters can start hunting the good guards at about 20-25..i think, I
am good and never have
been able to....well once by accident.....

Good luck
