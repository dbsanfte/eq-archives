Either one works very well with a shaman.  SK can grab and hold aggro 
better, and can take much more of a beating in general, and, eventually, 
can FD pull as well.  Once you are high enough level, you could probably do 
some of the PoP zones with an SH/Shaman combo.  Would be tougher with a 
monk.
