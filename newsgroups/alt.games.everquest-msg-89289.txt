Actually, you're even higher than that, since you did almost 2400 damage 
in 12 seconds.  You are pushing very close to 200dps, which seems more 
than a little impressive.  Run it for 5 minutes or so (duel a mage pet?) 
and see what you get.  It may have just been a really nice run of 
high-power hits, or you could be a truly awesome damage machine.
