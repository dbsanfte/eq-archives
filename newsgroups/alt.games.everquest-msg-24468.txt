No I would have thought at level 60 a character could give himself
(eventually) his maximum racial/class ability in all his stats. A Dark Elf
Warrior for example could have a natural 95 Str 95 Sta 115 Agil 95 Dex (and
119 Int, hmmm) These are the maximum stat levels if the player put all his
creation points (20) into these stats.
Or does that not make sense to you?

Allowing players to get 255 in all stats, now does that really sound like
Verant to you?

CF
As for everyone running around at level 60, not everyone will ever reach 60.
It is not and never has been the driving force behind me playing this game.
People that have made it that far should be rewarded with some way of
further advancement, IMO.
