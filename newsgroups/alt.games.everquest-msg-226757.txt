Sure, we all do.  Every cleric hates it when you let someone die.  Just ask
Monual he'll agree with me.
You've done really well with only 6 deaths at level 53 though. I wouldn't be
so upset if I were you.
I think you did the right thing. At 54 you get a much better spam heal spell
(915hp's I think off the top of my head - leaves sup. heal for dead).  This
new spell probably would have let your ranger "just" survive in time for the
warrior to regain aggro and for you to land it a 2nd time on the ranger.
Anyway regardless, I wouldn't have ducked out of the CH on the 20% warrior,
you done good. I'd let the ranger lose health in that situation, much better
chance for the warrior to finish the mob off once he's back at 100% health
and save a wipe than ducking out of the CH to save the ranger.
You just can't be everywhere at once.  That said, the Group Heal spells are
fantastic in LDON, I always have one memmed.  Horrible on mana, but great
for saving a partial or full wipe if the mob is almost done.
