  I agree.  I mean, what is really the point in doing "optimizations"
for people with top of the line, premium hardware?  It's typically not
THEM who need better performance.  Is a person who runs EQ at 80 fps
really going to notice if their frame rate improves by 30%?  Probably
not.  On the other hand, if there's a 30% boost (or decrease) in
performance for someone who usually gets frames per second in the
20-30 range, you can bet that's going to be noticed.

  They should be VERY sensitive to "optimizations" that increase
performance on the high end at the expense of those of us on the low
end.  The vast majority of people have lower end or mid range
computers, not Pentium 4's with RDRAM and GeForce3's.
