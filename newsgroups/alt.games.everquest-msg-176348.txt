Check this site for excellent bard advice:
http://pub142.ezboard.com/beqdivabardsofeverquest
There's a good guide there discussing swarmkiting but the site seems to have
some trouble at the moment so I cant link direct to it.

Basically you run around till you have a lot of mobs following you then
charm one of them and hit your /pet attack hotkey.  The crowd will beat on
your pet till it is almost dead and then you go invisible to break charm.
Chant the pet to death and repeat ad nauseum.
