Judging from last night, that should be 'most of the murkgliders' <g>.

Mobs hit for around 500 max (with a lvl 66 initiating the dungeon),
all are fully slowable so it's not a difficult camp. Our group of 6
had time to easily clear all the mobs between the two PH and grab some
other mobs while we waited for the 15(?) minute repops. 2 named and
about 8 PH in the time we were there, no runes just the trash drop
from each (a decent range slot item and a mask on par with a face mask
of frozen mana).
