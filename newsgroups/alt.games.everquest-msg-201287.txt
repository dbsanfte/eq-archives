The loot is there.  I think the point he was getting at is his guild really
struggles in the elementals.

Those 2 loots in 7 hours could have been 2 loots in 1 hour, if not for
learning the pulling, wiping a few times, waiting on people etc.

They are also competing against a MUCH more advanced guild.. I guess CiH are
keeping much of PoP on lock-down, Richard?

So no, loot doesnt drop in the Ele's like vexthal, but mobs also don't take
7 hours each to kill for 2 pieces of loot, they also don't take a week to
respawn like Vexthal (3 day repop)
