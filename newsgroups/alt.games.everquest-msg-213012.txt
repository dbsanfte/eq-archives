Heck, they could do PoJ zone out when they hit low to mid 50s. Stuff
there doesnt hit that hard or fast. That would be about it tho for PoP
zones. Other ideas when they get higher would be perhaps Skyfire or
Veksar. One thing that might help would be to get the warrior a weapon
that procs a slow, like a wavecrasher or something similar.
