Uh oh. I've been asking higher level mages (very politely mind you*) to
combine pet research-only spells for me. I have all the components, I have
kept my research skill up**. I've also been asked to combine spells for
mages lower level then me and have done so. Am I a beggar? Well...
technically... I guess I am. Crap.

*So far everyone I have asked has been most polite, and no one has told me
to "get a job".

**The Vision(tm) doesn't allow the research skill to actually be high enough
to have a favorable chance of success to combine a level X spell at level X.
(/rant) Or level X+19 for that matter. A 58 mage with maxed research skill
failed 1 out of 2 tries to combine a level 39 spell for me just last night.
Plus the research components are rare drop off mobs that are >= the spell
level. (/rant off)
