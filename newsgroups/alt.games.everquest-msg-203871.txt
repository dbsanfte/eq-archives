As others mentioned, just ask first.

Yes, and "it depends".  Remember that you can always be cursed or
blessed by the RNG.  A DEX of 127 is definitely better than 75,
but if you could get a big boost from a Shaman buff it would be
even better.  If you could borrow some DEX gear (or have stuff
lying around in the bank) that can help more.

Not sure what you could mean by a successful swing that didn't hit
the mob.

If you can't hold agro without constant taunting the other melees
in your group are taking too much damage.  Taunt is valuable, but
it is only one tool, you still need to be generating substantial
agro indepentent of taunt to do a good job of tanking.

There are some very effective 2-handers that are surprisingly cheap
nowadays.  If, for instance, you were able to get a Widebladed
Greatsword (34/34 2hs, ac25, rec level 53, iirc) in your mid-40s it
would probably produce so much more damage than any 1-handed pair
you could get ahold of that it would be comparable or even superior
for generating agro.  Dunno how your in-game finances are, nor how
they're priced on your server, but it's something to be open to.
And the Weighty Polearm (29/34 2hs, rec level 50, iirc) is/was so
common that people have been known to give them away.
