Well, my memory is coming back to me now... here's what I saw:

I was at level 22 or so then.  I was in LoIO and FV.  I was grouped with a
level 22 or so ranger.

I'd sing Selo's and the ranger (not SoW'd or anything) would *consistently*
outrun me.  It was hard to difficult to run to travel any distance because
the Selo's seem to be affecting the group far better than it was affecting
me.  She'd keep running out of range of the song.  I was NOT encumbered,
had no snare song effects on me, etc.  No obvious reason.

Also some of the other songs wouldn't work either.  Sometimes I could
get them to work for a tick or two, then they'd shut off.  Don't tell me
that I was imagining things .... I had played that character for 22 levels
at that point and you'd think I'd know how to run it well enough to sing
Selo's!

Someone told me that the bad behavior was zone-related, that the songs
worked correctly in other zones.  That seems dubious, but who knows.  I know
that EQ does disable certain songs in certain zones (such as the levitation
song, or Selo's in an indoor zone).

I think the problem actually cleared up in a day or two, but I had switched
to playing an Enchanter for awhile so I didn't know exactly when it got
fixed.

Regards
