Ok been reading some enchanter guides  and having problems.  I have a
36 Enchanter and is now located in CC.  Questions:  1 I use Color
Shift Tashni Lanquid Pace I root sometimes I charm and mez.  According
to what I have been reading an enchanter is for crowd control.  In a
perfect Norrah day I should not get hit, but I have to melee.;
Amazing I can take down Oracle with some probs but the Miners orcs or
watchman have a little more trouble.

Ok I am soloing.  When I group I  do extremly well Always full mana I
debuff, give haste when neccesary  root when they try to go away
(NPC's dont want to play anymore LOL)

Am I missing the role of Enchanter?  Any advise would be appreciated
Flames Permitted I learn from them too

Thank you all I have learned from this group
Yaniel 34 Season Xegony currently at CC
