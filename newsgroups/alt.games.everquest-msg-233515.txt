I've seen this on message boards and in game as well. I think there's a
lot of reasons for it, some valid, some not. The main problem is, as
usual, that a few bad apples can spoil it for everyone.

On the valid side, there seems to be a lot of bad clerics out there,
though probably they're about in the same proportion as bad players in
every class, when the cleric is bad it's more noticable than some other
classes. I've also known clerics back in Kunark days who used to
basically demand every gem that dropped in Sebilis while grouped there,
and one cleric who refused any camp he knew didn't have a decent gem
drop rate. Of course, I've also seen warriors who looted every corpse
before it hit the ground but again, the cleric is usually more noticable
in their greed than other classes. On Tarew Marr, when I started my
cleric, I noticed clerics seemed to have pickup group members so
trained they automatically tried to hand me every gem that dropped
after I hit the level where I was using peridots. I'd usually take one
or 2 to cover the costs of my dots and the fact I wasn't getting up to
loot mobs between fights then refuse the rest.

Travelling from zone to zone offering to rez for a large price also
gives other clerics a bad name and was common back in Kunark days.

On the invalid side, back when people were happily offering to pay
50-100pp for kei, when enchanters with it were relatively rare, they
were offering to supply the dot for a cleric to cast aegolism on them.
This undervaluing of the cost of the spell was one reason I never, ever
considered trying to play spell vendor. When asked for a buff in PoK
now, I usually just tell the asker I'm too busy atm to help them unless
I'm in an unusually good mood in which case I just cast it for free.
If I was in a group where the tanks are power looting every mob I'd
usually leave early, though once or twice I'd point it out just to see
if they stopped. Once in my upper 30's in Overthere I actually found out
that the tank who was doing it was under the impression that autosplit
was actually fair and didn't realize he was taking the lion's share of
the loot. He was quite apologetic when the group explained to him how it
really worked.
