    BB is pretty good with the changes they put in a while back. The new
Pickclaw goblins (that's the faction the wanderers are on) start Indifferent
to dwarves, so you cannot be jumped by anything unless it's assisting what
you're fighting or you already ruined faction. There's a fair number of
level 2 mobs, you can still hunt the decaying skeletons for good XP even
after they green (bone chip quest), and the vendors are right beside you.
You can even go and get a level one pet if you know what you're doing. :-)
It was slow at level 4 - lack of Aviak Chicks, fair chunk of green
bats/snakes, and most players lack the confidence to go to crossroads at
that level - but it's not so bad.

    James
