Relatively minor?  My ranger at 40 has 1202hp and 813ac FULLY BUFFED,
while my warror at level 33 has 1231hp and 703ac with no buffs at all.
Note, the ranger is in better AC gear than my warrior, whom I haven't
really played in about a year.  With a reasonable outlay of cash, I
could probably have my warrior pushing 800ac easily.  And that's 7
levels below the ranger.

Hell, just decided to check and, without buffs, Atticus is at 1112hp
and 769ac.  

I love my ranger, but he's no tank.  If fear doesn't stick right,
walruses in EW can have me down to 2 bubs of health in no time at all.
