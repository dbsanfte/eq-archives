Windows is comprised of a number of programs that won't show up on the
task managers as programs but are processes that run in the background.
So I would not be surprised to see a bunch of processes on a newly
booted computer even one that only has Windows installed.

If you wanted to see what was starting up the processes, you could go
to Start/Run/MSCONFIG and check the startup tab. It should show what
programs run at startup. You might be surprised. You can use MSCONFIG
to prevent them from running (YMMV). You can also manage what processes
Windows starts but if you disable the wrong one, you can prevent
Windows from working.

Good luck.
