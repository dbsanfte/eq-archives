I have little knowledge of rangers, but I get the impression they don't 
play a whole lot like warriors, with quite a list of spells and a 
relatively poor ability to take damage, they seem to demand a more 
complex approach.

Berserkers are medium tanks; yes, they can't take it as well as plate 
classes, but due to mana free stunning, the mobs tend to dish it out 
less well, until a mob can't be stunned they tank about as well as anyone.

Its a sad commupance in the high 50s when they suddenly take a beating 
as poorly as rangers do... but if the OP isn't aiming at going 60+, he 
won't know the difference!
