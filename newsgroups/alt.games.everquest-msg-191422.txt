I'm in the Air Force so I hope I can shed a little light on this subject.
First of all, I HIGHLY doubt that they would delete his email soon after his
death, since to be honest the military is extremely inefficient when it
comes to things like this.  There are a few guys that retired or left
military service as much as 6 months ago and their email addresses are still
active.

What a "bounce" most likely means is that he has been so busy he's been
unable to check his email and his inbox has filled to the point where no
more messages are able to be received.  This is partly from him getting
messages from friends and also because the military seems to love to
disseminate useless information (like meetings for officers sent to enlisted
folk, etc) via email.  Or (and this one I doubt, but there is the
possibility) the ship is not allowing any outside email to be sent to
members onboard the ship due to viruses, etc possibly being sent.

Orrr......your friend made the mistake another guy I work with made of
forwarding a stupid chain letter to everyone in his squadron and had his
email privileges revoked for a period of time.

Point being, there are a LOT of possibilities of which him being dead being
the reason being so very unlikely that I wouldn't even consider it if I were
you.
