When we've done it, it's usually been a melee who's not planning on being an
offtank.  We chose the role based more on the player than on the class.
Someone who knows the game, is attentive to strategy and is able to be
consistent with communication is far more important than class for this role.

Pure casters are a problem because they often don't have the HP to survive
small mistakes or bad luck.  Even this isn't critical for a lot of fights.
Otherwise, you can use anyone from any class, as long as they're not needed
in another role.

Good choices.

Heh.  If your rangers and rogues are dieing more often than anyone else, tell
them to shape up.  There's no excuse for over-aggroing even when you're NOT
performing a designated role for the raid.

>What am I missing?

It's going to matter more that the player is good at the role than the exact
class.  It can't be a class you're in short supply and that character HAS to
be in another role, but it can be just about anyone as long as you've got
enough of that class to free up the designated MA.

It can be a pally, for instance, for fights where no OT is needed, or when
you have enough spare pally/sk/warrior to handle OT without him.
