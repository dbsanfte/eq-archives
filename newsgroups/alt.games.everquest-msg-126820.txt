I was not attempting to say that they made up the rules based on scientific
studies.  I do think that it is likely that the rules were arrived at over
an extended period of time, and were due to noticing that not eating pigs
meant they were not afflicted with this disease, as such, it must be God's
will.  I certainly do not think that someone sat down and did studies,
figured out what was good and what was bad, then wrote up a bunch of rules
and proclaimed them to be God's will.
