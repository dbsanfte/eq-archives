I did a troll SK quite a while back (year or more).  Only got to level
19.  He was fun to play... not sure I would call what I did
"role-playing" but other folks seemed to enjoy his company.  Didn't
seem to be all that hard to level, and he didn't have much in the way
of twinkage.  Also there seemed to be more comraderie among trolls,
perhaps because there were so few of us.

I eventually gave up because I decided he wasn't really what I wanted
to play, mostly because he was hated virtually everywhere... had to
rely on my wife's char just to get food.  And going to the bank was a
no-go, even after I had worked on faction.  But he was fun, and now
I'm thinking I should dust him off.  I'd say go for it.
