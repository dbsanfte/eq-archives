Sigh. When I was level 13 and setting out for Qeynos for the first time
I saw a man in *chain armour* (OMFG) with *two swords* (OMG OMG OMG) and
*BRIGHT RED PLATE LEGS( *OMGMGMGMGMGMGG!!!!*)*...

It was rubicite of course, and this was a few months after the game started
in 1999. I was awestruck, I'd never seem anyone so uber, still desperately
proud of having a full set of store bought leather instead of tattered
and my 15pp store bought longsword.

"Wow... Thats so pretty.... Could I... I dont suppose I could try them on?"

"Sure thing... you like em huh?"

*nodnodnod*

*tries on rubi leggings, runs around saying 'wheee look at me!' and the
like, spins in circles, screenshots, smiles, and gives them back*

*smiles absurdly gratefully and gives the uber leggings back*

Later at level 20 or so someone did the same thing with a rubi bracer in
runnyeye.

I miss those days ;(
