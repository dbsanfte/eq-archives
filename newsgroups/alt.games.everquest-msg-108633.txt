Seconded.
I recently made an enchanter alt for my tradeskill supplies (I am
going to use her to enchant silver and maybe electrum if I can be
bothered getting her to 16). She is utterly untwinked, has nothing but
newbie dagger, newbie robe, cracked staff and some cloth armor, has
relied mainly on melee and whatever nuke/dot she has available to kill
stuff, and has received some buffs from passersby. Her dex is 70. 
A couple blues into level 8 her offense is one point from capped,
defense and piercing are capped, and only 1hb is lagging behind at 10.
