They aren't really amazing, I agree but to tell the truth, they seem
popular on my server at the moment.  Every time I check the bazaar,
the augments are all usually just +2 to this Resist or +4 to that, and
I've yet to see anything at all that gives ANY heal/damage at all.  

Pity they sell nothing heavier though  :(

Oh, there were a lot of casters complaining they'd been missed out
again by Sony, and I can sympathise with that to some extent.  I'm,
for example, still really pissed that Beastlords, Rangers and
Shadowknights get no Aura as a reward for doing the Takish-Hiz
Mission!
