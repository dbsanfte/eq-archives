On average a comparably equipped Warrior outdamages a Paladin
with SU3 vs. Undead also (not by much), at least according to
parses I've seen.  But, since SU3 gives occasional big hits it
is very streaky.  Paladin from FoH posted a screeenshot on
Paladins of Norrath the other day where he had 3 big hits (for
like 20k total) with Holy Forge active in an LDoN hard adventure.
In a later post to the thread he said the whole run was very
good for him, he thought he averaged 200 DPS.  So, on a lucky
day, fighting the mob type that is by far most vulnerable to
him, one of the very best equipped Paladins in the game can
for a little while average what a fairly ordinary high-end
Rogue or Ranger does routinely (or are those claims of 200 DPS
from Rogues and Rangers inflated?).  SU3 makes for some great
eye-candy, but as others have noted it does not make a Paladin
into a DPS class.
