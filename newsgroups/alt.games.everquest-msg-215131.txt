I played EverQuest for about a year until my computer hardware could no
longer keep up with the expansions. How does EverQuest Online Adventures
stack up to the PC EverQuest? I'm thinking of going this route instead of
buying a new $1000 computer every 2 years in order to keep playing. I've
never played games on consules such as PS2. How do u communicate with other
players? Do you use a keyboard with those systems? Thanks for any info.

Wade
