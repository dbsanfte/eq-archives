Well, my goddamn @home/attbi came back a good 1.5-3mb below what I had been
getting, on Sunday morning.  When I signed up with them they promised a
downstream of 1.5mb-3mb/sec top-end.  Now after this nifty little re-org,
they have the nads to tell me that they're considering having 'tiered'
service plans in the future and that my downstream is now capped at
1.5mb/sec.  I can't help but think there aren't some legal issues involved
here in charging the same fee for a service which is entirely different than
what I contracted to many months prior.

Oh, and it's not even a full 1.5mb downstream - don't believe what they tell
you.  I know modem users are probably thinking, 'oh poor baby, only 1.5mb
download speeds instead of the 5mb you were getting before waaaa!!!'

It's *exactly* the same effect as your dial-up ISP going out to lunch one
night and coming back the next day charging you the same money for a modem
pool full of 14.4's when you had been dialing into a poolf of 56k's.   Not
many would stand for that I'm thinking.

What a freakin mess.   The crossover was/is being handled beautifully.  The
kicker is this little 'feature' change they snuck in with the new network.
