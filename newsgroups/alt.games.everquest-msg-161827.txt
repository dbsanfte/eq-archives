    That still beats a regular server. On average, people in my guild that
are getting the PoP XP bug have to wait two DAYS, with character online and
petition in queue, before they get a GM to talk to them and fix them.

    Just a question when I first read the story - are you sure you didn't
res the same corpse twice? The second res would go through, but you'd get no
XP back - just like you said. If the corpse you looted the first time was
the unressed corpse, then to the GM's logs it would look like it "poofed".
I've seen people mix up which corpse is the ressed and which is unressed
before, so just wondering if maybe that happened.
