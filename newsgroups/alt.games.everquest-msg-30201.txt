What are the methods that these guides use?  I'm guessing the second 
link is baking, but anyone know what the mobs are in the first link that 
drop all this uber loot that no one knows about?  I'm thinking about 
buying the guide, and then posting all the info on the web, just to piss 
off these people who are obviously encouraging ebay farming and the sale 
of high end items for RL cash.

Just hate seeing all these "guides" for sale all the time.
