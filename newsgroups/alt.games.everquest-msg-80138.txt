After 28 levels of running around as a bard named Mcjagger, I got the /tell
from a GM telling me it's in violation.  Oh well.  I asked her if Krichards
was ok and she allowed it.  I said, lol, you must be pretty young.
Krichards is the stones guitarist!  She said thanks for being honest and let
me change it again.
I'm not bitching about the naming policy, I just think that unless it's
really offensive the naming policy should be more lax on a non-rp server.
No big deal though.  I supposed the surname Rollinstones was a little too
much though, hehe.

Safe travels all,
Sean...
