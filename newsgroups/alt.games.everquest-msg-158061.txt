That's correct..

You are completely right in that I was not really tanking (mobs were 75% 
slowed and we pretty much let aggro pingpong between shammy, shammy pet 
and myself) and I would lose a lot of efficiency if I were to be beaten 
on solely. What I wanted to illustrate with those logs is the rate of 
procs from the hammer, though.

Actually, those logs aren't even accurate for proc rate while soloing 
since I had shammy buffs on me for an extra 50 dex (plus other stats 
like str and sta) which should increase proc rate a bit (not to mention 
increased melee damage). Had shammy haste too (celerity), but I wouldn't 
count that since noone really seems to know if it will affect procs :) ..
