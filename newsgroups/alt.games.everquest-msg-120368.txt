Well, at least you recognize it.   Or did you actually mean to
quote someone else?   Assuming (since you responded to my
post) that you meant me:

Duh.  First, who said they joined and then had to leave in fifteen
minutes?   I've been to Hate raids with one group of our guild
and three or more groups from a lowbie guild.   And, believe me,
when you're the *only* 56+ cleric on the raid or the *only* 55+
warrior or the only monk with Hate pulling experience or the
only AoE KEI enchanter (let alone the only C2 enchanter), you
just don't walk out when you want.   You either wait until it's
finished or you get a replacement, both of which take time.  Add
on the fact that the lowbie guild got the whole raid wiped a
couple of times on the break-in because they didn't follow
directions, and ALL of the people in my guild who were there
were there a LOT longer than we'd planned.

Just as a guess, I'd say every player who's ever camped an item
in a lowbie dungeon has waited longer than they wanted just to
see if the next spawn would drop the item.   EQ's actually a
social game;  and has its own peer pressure built-in.   Try being
the healer in a level-appropriate group camping the SBS in
Crushbone when no other healer is LFG.   Sure, you CAN
Gate and /camp, but that's a nice way to ruin your reputation..

> and when have you <ever> looked for a safe place to stash

Well, for about 80 levels on two characters, I've used a LOT
of NO RENT bags with 100% weight reduction.   My 30 monk's
never went a full session without them, in fact, since he hit
level 10 or so.

So, yeah, I generally look for a safe place to stash that loot (like
a vendor) before camping...   I'd guess mages, shaman, and
anyone else who can summon them does too...
