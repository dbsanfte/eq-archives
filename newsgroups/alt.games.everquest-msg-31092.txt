Yup.  Illuminator.  Wizard, got him to 16th level before changing servers to
join a friend.

Have only played 3 chars since: Necro, Chanter, and now Warrior.  Until the
recent Warrior ( Dwarf ), I had only played Gnomes.  I think I'm missing 1
piece for a full set of Wu's, now, so I will probably try a Monk after I get
my chanter to 29 and the warrior to 20.
