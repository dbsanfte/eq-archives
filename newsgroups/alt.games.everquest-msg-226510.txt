Well you aren't very specific, but I think I know what you are talking 
about.

If I recall correctly, there are three different bandits in the 
Butcherblock mountains, each of which drops a tongue.  You need those 
three, and one that drops in Crushbone, for some quest or other in Kaladim.

I'm afraid thats pretty vague, but I read about it long ago when 
wondering the same question you were (only based on a tongue found in 
Crushbone), saw that it didnt' seem to apply to my character, and 
promptly started destroying the tongues whenever they dropped.

If you keep every no drop item you come across, you'll soon run out of 
bank space even if you use 7 mules to carry the load!
