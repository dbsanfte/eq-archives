Yes, but my point is, by saying he was once 30m from the guns, when he
wasn't, is unlikely to endear him to the Afghanis who regard him as a hero.
There must be some reason the Afghanis think this.

As I say, I don't know the truth of the matter, but the evidence I have seen
and read, leads me to believe that he was involved in frontline fighting. To
paraphrase one report, one Afghani said that the reason they thought so
highly of him was because he had come down from his palace to take his place
amongst the fighters.

It could all be propaganda made up afterwards to bolster a myth, but the
Afghani fighters have some reasons for their adoration of him.

Of course he needs demonising. All enemies do. You cannot have too much of
it. It's a basic tenet of Sun Tzu. If people are to kill others, then most
will need to have reasons that they can easily understand. Propaganda is one
of the great weapons of war of the last century, and is always used in
liberal doses any time you send your young men off to die.

Just as you need to demonise him in the above paragraph, by suggesting that
the only reason he was involved in this outrage was because of money. Money
does not motivate this man, you must know that, but it does make for a
motive that the average person can understand. I'm not saying it's a bad
thing, it is absolutely necessary, but you shouldn't make the mistake of
believing your own propaganda.

Propaganda will always be met by a lot of scepticism by me. The time to find
out the truth about him has long gone, and I doubt we will ever really know.
Both sides now have an axe to grind. As for me, him being a frontline
soldier seems to fit in with what else I had read about him, before this
murderous act in New York. Anything written since is liable to be tainted.
