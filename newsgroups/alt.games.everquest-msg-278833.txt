It sounds like one of two things. One, you either don't have the
DoN expansion (you have to have that to use the guild lobby/hall.)
If you *do* have the DoN expansion, a lot of us (all?) who had
it on the first day the expansion came out had to log out, do
another patch using advanced options and making sure DoN was
checked in advanced options and then log in.
