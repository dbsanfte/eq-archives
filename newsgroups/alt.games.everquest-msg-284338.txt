Look for a waist item called "Ribbon of Empathy". It's a belt pretty much
any class that gets a pet can wear. When you click on it, it will summon
your pet to you. You don't have to wear it all the time, either, if you
have a better belt. Just carry it around in a backpack and when you need
to summon Dog, swap it in, click it, swap it back out again.
