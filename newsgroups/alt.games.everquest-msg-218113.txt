I want hundreds or thousands of people--in the cities and marketplaces.
When you go into a dungeon, and can walk around safely like a tourist,
because everything dangerous is camped, that kind of shoots down the RPG
part of MMORPG, for those that want to role play traditional fantasy heroes.

Think of what LotR would be like if Gandalf called out "Camp check!" at the
entrance to Moria, found that everything was camped, and a raid was handling
the Balrog, so the Fellowship could just stroll through, with the only risk
being someone might train them on a pull.  Yuck!

So, I don't see instanced dungeons as being out of place in an MMORPG.  On
the contrary, I see them as very good, fixing the RPG part of that.
