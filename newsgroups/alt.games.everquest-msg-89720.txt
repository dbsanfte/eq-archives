No, you only end up in the "bad spot" if you fall into the
big enormous nearly bottomless "pit" in Paineel.  It's about the
size of a high school football stadium, it's really hard to miss,
but apparently easy enough to fall into anyway.  :-)

Just after you zone into Paineel (from Tox) and come out of 
the zone tunnel, the trail splits left and right.  If you
make the mistake of continuing to run straight, you'll
skydive down into the big giant pit.

If you fall in, you fall for what seems like a long time, then
you zone (into the Hole zone), then you splat for large damage
right at the feet of a lot of nasties.  Nor does having levitate
on help -- zoning into the Hole strips any levitation buffs
you may have.  *Splat*.

However, if you go into the Hole the "right" way, you can just
walk on in and look around, but you'll be very far from the
area where the skydivers have met their demise.

Go right ahead.  The "right" entrance is through the newbie
area and then down several flights of stairs, to where it
terminates in a picturesque little pool of water.  In the
water is a pile of rocks, one is actually a locked door
that will swing aside when you use the right key (or a Rogue)
to unlock it.  Many races can also squeeze through without
opening it, but my dwarf has never managed to be able to.

You'll zone through into the Hole via a short underwater
passage, and once in you can swim up to the surface of a
small pool and hop out onto dry land.  To exit, reverse
the procedure.
