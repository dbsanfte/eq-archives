The Warden Symbol of Tunare was the most enjoyable and rewarding quest
I ever did in EQ. The stats are pretty nice and the free root is
invaluable both solo and in groups.

* * * SPOILER * * *

Turn in 4 bone chips to an elf named something like Bronzeleaf in the
Felwithe Cleric's guild. Get the quest for the first symbol.

Head over to Lesser Fay. You must be in wolf form or the brownies will
kill you.

You need to kill ghasts until you get 4 hearts. These are wondering
spawns and their placeholders seem to be any wondering undead. If you
run along the road from the GFay entrace to about 1/2 way through the
zone and back you should be able to pick them and their placeholders
up on track.

Turn in the hearts, get the your first Symbol of Tunare and the quest
for the 2nd.

Bind in L Fay near the entrace to Steamfront. Head over to the undead
tower in L Fay. There are several mummy and skeleton static spawns.
Keep kiling them. Eventually a DE necro will spawn on the alter. Kill
him.  Loot his no drop items and quickly Gate.

Now start running from SF entrace toward the DE camp. You should see a
Dark Elf Courier on track. Pretty sure he's a Cleric. Kill him. Loot
his no drop items.

Turn in all the NO DROP items plus your 1st Symbol to Bronzeleaf. You
get your 2nd Symbol and the quest for the third. The right click
effect on the 2nd symbol is a buff +15 DR +15 PR so it's actually
probably worth doing the 1st/2nd symbol quest again for that item.


Head to the Erudite city and talk to some elf in one of the guilds.
She makes you gather 3 items.

#1 Pouch of fire goblin dust (something like that). Appears to drop
off any goblin in Solusek's Eye. After killing all kind of gobs, I
actually found it on a corpse of low level gob right at the entrace of
the zone. It's NO DROP.

#2 White Hellborne (sp?). Suppose to drop off Gnolls in split paw, SK,
and LR. This item is not no drop, I killed a bunch of gnolls inside
PAW but an xp group came in so I left and /auctioned for it in SK and
someone sold me one.

#3 Causic Substance (sp?). Head to Mistmore. Here's the easy way to
get it. Camo and head to the graveyard near the zone entrace. There's
a secret door and you end up in a room (I think it's called the jail)
with 3 locked doors and a fourth door. You open the fourth door and it
triggers the other 3. Behind one of the doors is a Dark Offender,
target it, nuke it dead, and loot you no drop item. Since multiple
things will be nuking you, best to gate at this point.

Bring those 3 items back to her and she gives you a pouch of banish
undead (or something like that) which you give to Bronzeleaf plus your
second symbol for your Warden Symbol of Tunare.
