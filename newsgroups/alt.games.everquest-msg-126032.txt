    I think our guild uses necro nukes and Neb's Warbones to make the
bounding box more transparent for people. I say "I think" because by the
time I log on the guild will already be on the move to it, and all I get is
guild chat - booooo no CotH zones!

    Rampage is simple with AL: he will rampage in the order he is aggroed at
first. Nothing can get you off the rampage list, but if you move OOR he'll
Rampage the next person on the list. So you can control who gets on Rampage
by positioning, by camping everyone out after you get in the room to clear
any hate geenrated killing the Rhozh's, and by having people you want on
Rampage plink him with arrows/cast on him. As for splitting the damage
output so it's more manageable, look to chaotic tanking. We have a more
unique solution on top of this involving shadow knights getting
chain-summoned and assist healing, but our strategy is a bit complex. =)

    I hate Sontalak, too. No real healing, no strategy, just spray out every
last point of damage you can and hope he drops before too many of you drop.
Any encounter where some of the clerics are encouraged to nuke is pretty
busted.
