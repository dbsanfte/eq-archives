There is a way to regain faction with centaurs, I remember hearing about it 
and then dismissed it because really, it's not that big a deal. Like you, I 
was a harvester who enjoyed the freedom of running around not worrying about 
centaur aggro. But when you consider the number of quests that require 
killing centaurs (including one of the armor quests) you're better off just 
taking the hit and kiling them. When the time came and I finally went KOS to 
them, it was actually quite liberating and opened up far more possibilities. 
And you know what? I still continued to harvest. /shrug

By the way, although most players starts off non-KOS to centaurs, not all 
do. I've known a few people who were KOS as soon as they took their first 
step into TS. It might be a racial or faction issue of some kind with writs, 
dunno.
