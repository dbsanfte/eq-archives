I'm new to the Bazaar..just spent my first hour there last night. I have a
quick question though: Is there a command to help you find a particular
trader, or do you pretty much run around until you get lucky?  It's not so
bad if the trader you are looking for is guilded, or a larger race...but I
found myself running around for several minutes at one point only to find
the items were sold once I got  to the trader.  One more thing. Who sells
the bags that you sell goods from?  Thanks.
