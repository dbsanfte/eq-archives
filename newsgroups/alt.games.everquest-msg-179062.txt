I finally decided to hook up to Magelo:

http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=578619

I would appreciate upgrade suggestions from the group.  I have minimal 
cash, so spending more than 100-200 ( maybe 500 if it's a serious upgrade ) 
on an item is more than I can probably afford.  I'd prefer not to spend 
more than 1k ( 2k is a definite max ) total.

My guild loves to get together and focus on a drop to upgrade someone.  I'd 
prefer upgrades that can be obtained by a group of characters around level 
50 - 55.  I'm sure there are obvious ones to you guys that won't be hard to 
obtain.
