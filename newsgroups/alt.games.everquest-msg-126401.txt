Yeah, I recall from playing EQ that the cities and such were so huge. But I
was told, by a source I cannot remembe, that DAoC was just as big... BUT the
problem is it's divided into 3 realms and you can only play exclusively in 1
so then it isn't as big as EQ. And yeah, I'm already finding that I'm
hitting the same places all the time... Not so huge.

See with EQ I played an entire day just fishing. It's fun, and I miss that
in DAoC. The closest you can get is crafting, but that gets boring fast...

I don't know. I'm sort of teetering here. I'm having a lot of fun with
DAoC... May just play it until I get bored then switch over to EQ.
