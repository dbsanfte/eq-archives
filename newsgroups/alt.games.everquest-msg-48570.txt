As far as I know. Multitasking *isn't* banned specifically. If the
action of multitasking was listed as a bannable action then sure, I
would expect people to be banned for multitasking without complaint.
AFAIK, while not wanted, it's not specifically banned, merely some of
the means to achieve it are banned.
