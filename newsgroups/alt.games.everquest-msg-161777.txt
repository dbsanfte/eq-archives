We are not talking about break in only here, the conversation included
killing the golems.  I do not believe that we could put together a single
group that could take them down.  Maybe the one that does not DT, with the
best we have available in the guild.  I don't think the DT ones are doable
by a single group from the guild.  Off the top of my head, would be 62
Ranger, 61 Cleric, 60 Enchanter, 60 Shaman, along with, whatever would be
best from (60 druid, 60 SK,  59 Ranger, 59 Paladin, 58 Warrior, 58 Ranger,
57 Wizard, 55 Monk, 55 Rogue).  Damn, didn't think we had that many 60+ in
guild now, enough for one whole group now.  We do have another 60 Druid in
guild, but he is not playing much now, as he is quite busy with school.
