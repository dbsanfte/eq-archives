A female bard I know used to have the blonde face, now she has mine
(brunette, green eyes and red lips). I suspect she either made her
hair red or brown, or picked my face - I haven't had a chance to test
face changes yet.
The bummer of it is that it seems /facepick changes the old face
*once*, since a guildie of mine has tried everything to get her old
face back but is stuck with one she hates on the old models.
