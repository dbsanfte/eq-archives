Buying with 1.5k?  Not really.  Some below fall in that
range but you're not so poorly equipped that'll make a
huge difference.  The single most important things to do
are a) farm cash so you can buy decent stuff and/or b)
join a guild that raids enough places where you'll get
decent drops.  "Raid" below is used loosely.  You can
kill dragons in WW, for instance, with one good group.

You should have a far better BP by now.  Either Etheral
Mist, one of the Velious quest ones, an Emerald Scale
BP or at least a PSC.

Belt of the Cenobite is an obvious upgrade for the waist.

Tons of better choices for back: Shissar Scale Cloak is
good or just do the Aegis of Life quest.

Mask of War for your face. (Raid in Kael.)

A good talisman from any of the WW dragons for your neck.
(Raid in WW)

Kromiff Military Leggings quest for your legs.  (Or get
Donals or other AC legs.)

Boots of the Huntsman for your feet, or at least Coldain
Skin Boots.  And Coldain Skin for your hands, too.
(More Kael drops although the boots drop in Icewell Keep.)

Amantite Epolets for shoulders.
(Lower Guk.)

Replace plat jewelry with velium.

And so on and so on.

Tons of stuff you CAN do.  It's more a question of what your
WIS/mana is at now and what resists or other stat boosts you
need.  I'd say the single biggest upgrade you need is a decent
BP but you're not going to find one there for 1.5k.   You can
probably get a group to farm PSCs in DN, though.

The most important thing, though, is to decide what stats you
want and start juggling equipment to get there.  Disease and
poison resistance, for instance, isn't an everyday need.  So
drop some of that stuff in the bank and get +mana/+ac/+hp items
there.  And so on and so on.
