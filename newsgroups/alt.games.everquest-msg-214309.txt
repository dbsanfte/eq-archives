hmm..

My approach would be to get all the mind buffs you can, solo hill
giants in Rathe, make 3-4kpp and level slowly.

Buy an Acrylia studded cloak, an acrylia studded tunic, 2 velium
jasper rings, a couple of chipped bone bracers, and Qeynos Tea and
Misty thicket picnic

A quick estimate is around umm....50+ points of wisdom on top of your
80, taking you to 130ish, add to that a Charred Guardian shield, and a
centi warhammer, and you're at 140+, having only used 6 body slots.

Another approach might be to hang around /oocing in Umbral Plains
until you can get yourself a nice suit of Elysian Armor.

You might also consider going for mana items.

Lastly I'd definitely reccomend that you visit Allakhazam.com and
register your character there, it's very easy to make a wishlist anf
get details of ugraded equipment.
