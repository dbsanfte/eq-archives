i was wondering (maybe i should make this a new post or whatever)

what happens to people who get caught using exploits? same category? like
those people who almost killed some hard mob a long time ago, by using an
exploit . . they all got banned, IIRC

they were talking about the "sploit" in /gu, so there were records of the
affair . . this was a while ago, methinks

or what about just nuking bards from the roof of their houses, or recondite
bandits from up on paludal's walls?


this is the same caliber cheating as being able to run faster, IMO . .
anyone know what happens?

or do they start off with a warn, assuming it's not serious (like the above
case of the guild using sploit to almost-down dragon) ?



thanks, curious
