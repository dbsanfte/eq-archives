So, that just means it would not be possible to tell ALL THE TIME whether or
not it was legit (in those cases where it matters).  For example, my last LD
death occured when I was outdoors, with full health and mana, with jboots
active, pulling a blue mob that ran at normal speed, to a convenient
location to kite it.

It would be nice if the server could consider the situation when you go LD
and make a reasonable guess as to whether or not you were in trouble.  If
you are not in trouble, it could give you a break and log you out safetly,
E.g., if you've taken little or no damage, have plenty of mana, and are
running faster than the mobs chasing you, and they aren't casters so have no
way to damage you out of melee range, you should survive...or at least you
and the mobs should stop, and the mobs should wait a few minutes to give you
a chance to get back in control.
