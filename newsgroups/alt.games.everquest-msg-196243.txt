If you want to get him to 30 and fast, the best exp I've found has to be the
Needlites in echo caverns.

These little blighters only hit for around 20 max but hit fast, and I mean
really fast, on the plus side any melee with a DS on tears these up really
fast as they pretty much kill themselves on the DS.

If you pull the room in a clockwise direction you should be able to single
pull the whole room except for the final two mobs.

I found the exp here to be almost on par with PC but this does lead to it
being a popular camp often making a whole yellow of exp per room clearing.

Hope that helps.
