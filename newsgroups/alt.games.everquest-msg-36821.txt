This reminds me of when Verant was talking about underused zones, and how
Kerra Isle was one of them.  Well lets see here, the drops are horrible, and
the somewhat decent things that do drop, drop deep in the zone, so that
anyone of a level who would use the item, can't attain the item.  Second,
everything in the zone is a shaman, and while it seems you're fighting
something solo, you suddenly see 19 casting messages from inside of
buildings and your mob has just gotten 19 heals.  Lastly, there's that
deplorable pathing in the zone.  Whack a kitty, see it warp away, then see
it and its 80 closest friends running at you at SoW speed.
