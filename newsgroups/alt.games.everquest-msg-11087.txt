Yep, but only the 50 (Melody of Ervaj) and 60 (Composition of Ervaj)
songs.  These songs stack with all other hastes and add 5% and 10%
respectively to the haste total.  They require the bard to be using a
brass instrument or the epic, and are generally of limited usefulness.
I could see them being helpful on a 50-100khp mob if the bard were in
the main tank group, but generally in that scenerio a bard is twisting
resists for all he's worth.  Other bard haste songs do NOT stack with
haste spells, even though icon is visable and the str/dex/agi boost is
active.
