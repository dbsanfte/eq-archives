I always grin when I see the "TLC rules" suck comments. Entire games have
been built rather successfully based on that premise. ( Don't tell me about
DAoC's content problems. It has nothing to do with TLC. ) As far as FV goes
the TLC is one of the reasons I started a toon there. More players
dependencies should develop. As long as there are few no drop items TLC is
great.
