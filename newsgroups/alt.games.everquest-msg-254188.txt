First things first.

NEVER accept no as an answer.  Its important to know that not all GMs
are created equal.  Truth be said I would almost avoid even bothering
with those people in the chat channel.  Guildes are nice folks, but
really can't do much for you.

When you have a problem, get on the phone and call sony support.  Be
nice, but angery.  Make sure it sounds like you are just barely
keeping it in check.  When you get a bad answer, be direct.

"I am sorry, but that does not seem fair.  I would like to have my
call escalated to a supervisor".

Make them work for that 12.99.   

When they give you the.. "did you report it in /bug".  

"No, and I will, however you still need to fix the problem."

Be direct, be honest, don't be an !@#!@# but stick up for yourself.

Sony is trying to get better at this stuff, remind them of that also
:)
