well i am not ben but here goes.  FUngi tunics are pieces of armor that i
think every melee type can wear.  They are decent on armor class (ac) but
the great thing about them is they give you "chloroplast?", which is a heal
over time spell and a very very nice one at that....they are especially nice
for monks and shadowknights who usually FD and then just heal up while
playing dead...but they are also good for other classes as well.
