    Congrats, melees. This looks like really good stuff. :-)

    Hope this clears a lot of the excess plat in the market out, so prices
drop again. My twinks need more gear!

    This is an awesome feature. Hopefully there'll either be a search
feature for these tokens, or they'll have a common naming convention (such
as "all token names start with 'bag token'") so people can look for them
with ease. I also hope right-clicking on the token gives the information on
the bag (Lore status, slots, size capacity, weight reduction, weight).

    You mean a level 1 proccing an effect for hundreds of damage isn't
working as intended? ;-) I hope they also got the recommended level not
affecting DAM on weapons bug, too.

    Stupid, the hat also has Ultravision and most rogues have the mask from
Lower Guk for ultravision. Change this to Grim Aura.

> Rune Crafter's Boots, Wolf Caller's Boots

    Stupid, the bracer also has Ultravision. If they want to give a minor
effect, put Inner Fire on the boots.

    Looks like bards are getting a lot of attention this patch!

    When it says 95%, does it take into account mana preservation items? It
looks like you should still be able to canni-pet with Improved.

    Really stupid and annoying bug. I'm really surprised this bug ever made
it off Test.

    DRAT, they caught it. Oh, well - was fun while it lasted!

    What issues were those?

    This should be interesting. There's a few trades where one could still
make a very small positive profit (Jewelcrafting) by design. Be interesting
to see how the system figures out pricing, and how much below cost it
discounts items.
