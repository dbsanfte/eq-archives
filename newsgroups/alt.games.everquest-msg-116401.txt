Hi.

A long time ago I got a runed oak bow, Dly 43 Dmg 21, Rng 125, Magic.  My
ranger has been happily using this for some time.  Tonight I got another
with my druid.  Since my druid doesn't use a bow I figured I would sell it.
I checked some prices online, and it's mind boggling.  One said 990pp,
another 500pp, and another 500-1000pp.  The comments of people visiting the
seem to put it at about 400pp.

Does anyone know if I can really sell it for that much?  And if so, why?  My
ranger is a fletcher, and it's been awhile since I played him, but I think
he can make a better bow (eventually, his skill is only about 120 right
now).

Thanks in advance,

Lewis
