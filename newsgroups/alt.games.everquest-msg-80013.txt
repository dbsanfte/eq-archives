Well, if the fight lasts more than 1 minute I will try an EB. At least at
this level the low level pets are light blue so I can resummon. From 49 to
51 all were blue and I had no way to know if they were  47 hitters or 55
hitters until they actually attacked.

BTW, I didnt know that Cancel Magic helps you pull singles where other
spells would get you adds. Wonder why is that. My favourite pulling spell is
the level1 Siphon Strength. It is the fact that a non-damaging spell does
not generate enough aggro to make the mobs assist your target ? If so,
Siphon STR would work. I like it because it's a really fast casting spell
and sometimes it's nice to have that extra 10 STR :)

So you're saying that I should redirect some xp to AA from this level ? I
was about to wait some more before doing so.
