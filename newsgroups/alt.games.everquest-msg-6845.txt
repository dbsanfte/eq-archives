Never heard this... very useful if true, as you could use it to locate
spawn sites to camp!  Just follow that mob back to its spot, kill it,
and set up housekeeping in a nice "safe spot" nearby.

As far as I know, all the pet commands except /pet get lost will work

/pet who leader is often overlooked, but it is very helpful to tell your
party which mob you charmed.  Nothing more annoying than attacking
or casting on a charmed target by accident while the "real" target
gets ignored.  Yes, /assist is one way around this, unless you are the
crowd control person, who wants to niether cast on the main
target nor your charmed one, but instead the -other- adds that need
to be messed, feared, stunned, rooted or what have you to keep
em out of the fight.

Here's another trick:  Try charming mobs of much lower level than
yourself.  Sounds silly, but these critters can be useful in leading
an attack against HT or caster mobs, since they will bear the brunt
of the initial attack while you debuff, DOT and so forth.  You can
even safely buff up the little critters, since when your charm breaks
you won't be faced with a horror of your own creation... A snow
bunny with Guard and Valor and some resist buffs still isn't a threat
to a party in their 40s!
