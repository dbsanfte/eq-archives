You sure?  It doesn't pay, so it won't push you into a higher tax bracket

Hehe, I hear ya.  We should sic our local team of writers on it.  I was 
thinking more, we have some serious dead horse topics of our own that it 
might not hurt to deal with in the FAQ in a similar fashion.  

Yea, probably not half. :)

Ahh... but redundant systems are great!  What I wouldn't give for more 
redundant login servers this week... :)

}might add it.. but not all at once, and not right now.

No doubt. :)
