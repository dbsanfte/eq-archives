Agreed, I really enjoy this game as an alternate. It has alot of
features that I hope other future games take to the next level (the
mission system is simply brilliant).

What makes you think SWG will be a dud? Sounds pretty enticing to me.
Ive heard alot of positives from testers on it so far (of course its
off of the official SWG site, so its bound to be all positive I
suppose).

EQ2 is a long way off, and you are already labeling it a dud? Why?
(maybe Im about to answer my own question here...) I do agree Im not
sure some of thier design choices are exciting, last time I looked,
seemed like they were taking a page out of DAOC's design document, but
lets give them time to release more info before we give up on it ;)

AC2 bored me out of my skull. Theres no sense of community there. I
played at launch for a few months, and really disliked it. It felt
so... hollow and unfinished, it felt sooooo rushed to market.

Earth & Beyond got really boring quickly as well. Once you get past
the pretty graphics, there didnt seem a whole lot there.

One of the problems is comparing the depth of EQ with new games which
just isnt a fair comparison. EQ has had 4 years to build content, so
any new game will always seem lacking in depth compared to EQ.
