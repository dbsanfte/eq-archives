Uh... what has time /played got to do with it? A soloer/grouper can be 
logged in play for 10x as much as a raider and still have inferior gear.

Some encounters have their tricky bits, yes. But as long as the raid 
leader knows the tricks and the rest of the raid can follow directions 
most raids are not much beyond that. Maybe you can't be actually afk, 
but you aren't tensely hunched over the keyboard either.

Sadly true.
