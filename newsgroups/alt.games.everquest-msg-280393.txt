The command "/pet back off" empties the pet's hate list so it will stop
attacking a mob and either move back to its guard point, back to its
master, or stop in place (a tactic using /pet sit). This command does
not affect the mob it was attacking so you may have to spam the command
otherwise the pet will go back to attacking the mob.

The tactic to get the mob off you is to have a hotkey with "/pet back
off" (maybe on several lines) and a hotkey "/pet kill".

With the pet already engaged, turn and target the ADD (I have F8 tied
to 'target nearest npc' which usually works but not always), spam your
'pet back off' hotkey a few times and then hit your 'pet kill' hotkey.
If you haven't done something like overnuked (over aggroed) the ADD,
the pet's attack should yank the ADD off you and onto it. Step away
from the fight and you should be in the clear.

That is the basic tactic. YMMV
