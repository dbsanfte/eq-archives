The technique is usually set so the mage's pet is getting EXP for toon
lower in level than the mage, but the toon is able to get EXP when
grouped with the mage.  

A level 30 toon can group with a mage up to 45 and still get
experience.  The 45 mage has a level 37 pet.  It means the level 30
toon gets exp for the kills done solely by the mage's level 37 pet,
not necessarily the mage getting exp.  

I predict Verant will adjust the exp given to pet classes at some
point.  If the group or mage does over 50% damage - same as at
present.  If the pet does 51% to 99%, same division of exp as at
present.  If the pet does 100% damage, no exp for the group.
