Luclin puts devotees to test


By the BBC's Damian O'Neil 
Shadows of Luclin is an expansion pack for the online role-playing
game, Everquest. 

Online role playing games are essentially a means of spending time in
an alternative virtual world, where you meet other like-minded souls
and go about developing your character.

If you want to play Shadows of Luclin, you need the original Everquest
game, an internet connection, and lots and lots of time. A monthly fee
is also payable. 
 
Ostensibly, the object of the game is to choose a character, and make
your way through an online world called Norrath, which is populated by
other role-players and a rich assortment of computer-controlled
beasties. 

In the early stages, it is these which are the main focus of your
attention, as you gain experience by fighting them. More experience
enables your character to progress to higher levels, which bestows
enhanced abilities and skills upon you. 

You can choose to take the path of an out-and-out warrior, a mystical
spell-caster, or something in-between. 

However, this only describes the basic mechanics of the game. There is
so much more to it, but you have to take part in order to fully
appreciate it. 

The role-playing aspect is undoubtedly the most complex and involved
side to the game. To illustrate the seriousness with which it can be
taken, it should be noted that some characters have actually got
married during the game. 

Improvement 

You can join, by invitation, other bands of adventurers, which will
greatly enhance your chances of progressing your character. It is at
this point that the depth of the experience begins to reveal itself. 

It is also the point at which you realise that this is anything but a
casual game. For some players, it is clearly an alternative way of
life. At the very least, it requires a very substantial time
commitment in order to gain the maximum benefit. 

You cannot expect to dip into it occasionally, and get any real
satisfaction. But if you are prepared to spend the time, and the
monthly fee, there is a highly complex and rewarding world awaiting
you. 

The Shadows of Luclin expansion adds a huge new playing area, new
characters and improved graphics. If you already own the original, the
improvements make this an essential purchase. 

If you are new to this sort of thing, buy the original and stick with
that for the moment. If you decide you enjoy the experience, the
expansion will soon become necessary for the above reasons. 

Everquest: Shadows of Luclin is available on PC format.
