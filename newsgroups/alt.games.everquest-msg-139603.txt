Greetings all.
    I've not been on any grand raids like some of the ones posted here.  I
can say that at Lvl 52 I happily charged the Idol of Rallos Zek. I had hoped
that the few seconds it took him to turn me into Dwarf-goo would buy others
some time to /camp, FD, or flee like bards. As in another post, the Idol had
wandered over to our Arena Faction/Drop hunting group, and flexed his
muscles on us. Payback is a long way off.
    For now I'm quite happy attending the weekly raids on Nagafen and Vox.
Well, I used to be happy, until the Lady started attending Rallos' Health
and Fitness Gym.  Looking at D.Ro's message board, it seems she's been alive
for a number of days, and survived many attempts to take her out. Our server
maintains a customer-managed list of Guild-sponsored raid leaders (the
merits of which can be argued in a seperate thread, please), with a 48 hour
time-limit before the dragon becomes FFA.  The last attempt i was present
for had about 37 raiders and included a good mix of clerics, bards,
enchanters, shamen, and wizards.  We managed to get her to the point of
having to CH herself, which she did, then it was all over quickly.  As a
cleric, she can (and did) also use nukes. Her last damage to me was 496 HP
Wrath or somesuch.  kinda like having two breath weapons.
    All this drivel is just to beg the question:  Has anyone else who
attends Vox raids noticed she has gotten a tad tougher, or are we just not
doing something right on Druzzil Ro?
