Definately. The really interesting part for me was the memories were 
dominated by sights of stuff many new players have never seen, but not 
because they aren't high enough level, because they are old haunts which 
nobody goes to anymore... which no old player could help but remember 
from having them burned into his brain a thousand times over.

Stuff like the entrance to blackburrow, the bank of freeport, the 
spectre tower in oasis, the aviak city in SK, or 'landmarks' like 
chessboard, the evil eyes in the gorge, or the hand in innothule 
swamp...

Yet the new content was comparatively glossed over; it felt like more of 
a blur, as they went through pop raids etc...

It was a very cool movie. But like you say it really only really hits 
home with the old gaurd players.
