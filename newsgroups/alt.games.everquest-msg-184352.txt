As others have said before, that assertion most certainly is not open for
debate.  My mother is a professional classical singer, music teacher, and
vocal coach. I've both observed and experienced vocal training, and while
my acute intonation might be inherited, everything else (range, proper
breathing, tone, various other things I've forgotten) was a product of
long hours.  As with everything you have prodigies and fast learners (I'm
sure several of you have "stories" to this effect), but vocal cords and
lungs are as responsive to training as any other muscle/tissue used for a
learned-ability.

That being said, everyone can sing.  Everyone can jump too...doesn't mean
that you can't learn a skill involving jumping (ala acrobatics, pole
vaulting, etc.) Singing _well_ is a skill.  Untrained folks can sound
pretty on a simple song.  Trained singers can preserve their voices for 50
years even when singing 5 nights in a row (though I don't recommend adding
little sleep and stress to that combo) and can perform complex pieces.

That's what I love about this newsgroup BTW...I can get as off-topic as I
like and no one starts squawking.
