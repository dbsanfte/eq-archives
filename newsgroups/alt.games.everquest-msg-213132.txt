I am very glad they fixed it. My guild was hitting BoT towers pretty
hard for a while while I was on vacation, but focus has been squarely
on getting ready for Emp the past month, and now I was wondering if I
was ever going to be able to get any ornate. As it is, I was on my
first tower raid (pickup) this morning, and got to see another druid
win the ornate leather tunic pattern that dropped (/cry)
