What?  You don't think it's useful to be able to run all the way to your 
corpse, then hit that shaman/druid AA rez get no xp back, and be right at 
your corpse?

The veteran AA rez is handy, but, as you said, at once a week, not that 
significant in fame terms.

The one thing the shaman/druid AA rez is good for is summoning a rezzer 
to his corpse so that he can then rez himself and others, or summoning a 
single person who died to their corpse so that you can continue with what 
you were doing, and hope he can get a real rez afterwards.
