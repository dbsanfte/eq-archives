  Agreed: I've had this for a few months now, and can't live 
without it. There are still some ways they could improve it, 
but it's a pretty great controller. 

  So far, I've used it with no problems in EQ, Camelot, 
Quake 3, Half-Life, Star Trek Bridge Commander, etc. 
I'll probably also map functions for some common 
Photoshop/Homesite features, too. 

  Things I wish it had: 

  * dedicated shift state buttons (though I could just 
    reprogram the D-Pad)
  * Indicator lights on the OTHER side of the controller
    (you can't see them in their current position)
  * Perhaps a more curved/ergonomic keypad

And a suggestion: 

  * Eliminate scroll wheel: it's useless and causes problems. 
    The location of the wheel is bad, too. 
  * The font in the profile/loadout manager is too 
    small for me: I want control of the fonts. :) 

  I get some sporadic "key appears to be stuck on" problems 
with the controller now and again: pressing a key makes
the problem disappear.
