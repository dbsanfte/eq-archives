Yes they are undercons in so much  as any npc/mob caster in the game is an
undercon, this is because they can out outcast *and* out melee any player
within their level range, fact of the game.
The brownie scouts are mid 40 (or less) druids (they maybe rangers but
they're spells seem to powerful for that level ranger) always have damage
shields up so tanks/melee should use 2hders where possible when fighting one
and root, snare, nuke to their hearts content, they are also SoW'd. They
seem to travel in groups but not obviously, so you may think you have a
single but his buddy will be with you shortly.

I have only run into them recently and at 52 they would still be a problem
to my warrior if not for the 50 druid I have with me (even then I have lost
my druid after getting a second add) but I remember friends telling me of
the horror stories of these things at mid levels in that zone.

The only plus side to the "overpowered" mobs is that sow'd mobs do not seem
to move as fast as a sow'd player (unless you are chasing it) so if you have
selo's or SoW you should be able to get away. Of course to overcome this
small deficit the mobs have no need for range or line of site for casting,
just aggro on you is good enough, my druid was rooted by one that I had
snared and ran from, the root wore off long before the brownie even came
into view and was always out of range for my root in response :ï¿½)
