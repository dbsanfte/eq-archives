Thats the one. Wanted to chop that sucker down. Had to drag my druid
out of retirement and port her out (I KNEW my druid would have a use
one day!!).

Had another oddity happen in Plane of Mischief. Being rather sick last
week but desperately needing my EQ fix, we were messing around in the
forest outside of the castle when I pulled a named mob. During the
fight, I got summoned and didnt think much of it. After the battle, I
discovered something rather dismaying. It had summoned me right inside
of a tree and I couldnt get out. Tried to shadow step - didnt work. It
actually was rather humorous seeing a little gnome's head sticking out
of the base of the tree. Retired druid to the rescue!!!!!
