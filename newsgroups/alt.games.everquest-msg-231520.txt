You do precisely that /tell Group_leader I'm really sorry, but that
person is on my ignore list for a very good reason and I won't group
with him.  I need to go now.  /disband.  Grouping with known idiots 
is a good way to ruin your enjoyment of your play session - you play
to have fun and should not do that for anyone.
