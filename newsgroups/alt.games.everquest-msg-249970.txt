Well, at least you've backed off of "every class except druids." and cut
down to three specific classes.   Lets see if we can get you through the
rest of your denial.

Warriors can be replaced in most fights by well equipped paladins or
shadowknights.   Clerics can be replaced by druids.

In much the same way, druids are "required" in any fight where AE damage
requires MGB heals, any fight where resists are key, and any fight where
mana regeneration is key.  (Hmm... that seems to be all of the fights.)

Thats because you're being silly.

Protection of the 9 / Symbol is the best base HP buff combo.  It adds more
HP than Virtue, so it's best for Melees, and it adds more mana regen than
any buff in its slot, so it's best for casters as well.

Yet you said above that clerics could not be replaced....  Sounds to me like
you did replace them.

You've been told several times.   Pot9, fire debuffs and MGB heals.   Aside
from that, you appear to be hung up on the idea that if they're not the best
at something, then a class is worthless for that purpose.

Sounded like it to me.

Which is the same position as just about every other class.  Rangers,
Paladins, Shadowknights, Rogues, Wizards, Mages, Necromancers, Beastlords,
Bezerkers...

You tried to claim Druids were unique in this.

Every class brings something to a raid, and every raid can survive without
one or several of those classes.
