I, too, used to make the run from FV with sub-20 chars all the time.  I just
think that it is easier to get to SB than LOIO when you are starting
anywhere other than FV and/or Paineel.  Once you know the route through SB,
the run is easy and the mobs path is bad enough that even w/o a SoW you
should have little trouble getting through without dieing (you will get
smacked a bit).  I have never died with any char running through SB.  I
have, though died to those damn spiders 2 times, though, when one was at the
zoneline and when one popped on top of me (chanter both times, naked and by
definition with no HPs).
