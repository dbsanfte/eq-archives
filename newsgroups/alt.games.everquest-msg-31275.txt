I went there in my low to mid-40's.. great zone. I'd highly recommend an
enchanter, and maybe a feign dead capable puller. The pathing there is
really wacky. The first time I fought there a ranger was using his bow to
pull mobs from within the "courtyard" area. He never brought back less than
3 at a time. It was quite exciting (eep!). Then I started pulling - not only
did the pathing seem better when you ran up and whacked something, but I
would FD near the main gate, and the ranger would peel off a mob. Worked
great.

And, for the guy who got bent out of shape over the CoM acronym.. take a
chill pill! If you don't know what CoM is then you haven't fought there, and
can't offer advice anyhow. Sheesh..
