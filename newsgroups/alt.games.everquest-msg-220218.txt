where did you find this info?
I have been playing for almost 4 years and I am only lev 35 a druid this is
because of changing chars in the past.
I have been hardly been twinked at all just by my boyf handing me the odd
lot of plat a couple of hundred and getting his cast of armour if that
counts as twinking then I am a twink and if there really is gonna be a less
effective fear and a SoW that only lasts 3 minuites then chances are that we
would both leave the game. so we need to find out exactly what the proposed
changes to classes are.
Ceri :o)
