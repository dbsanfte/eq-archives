 I've seen him too, with my Lev 33 Druid in Lavastorm.  shows up as a blank
entry on the track window, and you can actually track it. And it's at the
bottom of one of the lava pools.. Don't know what it cons, since it's just a
blank space on the window (hence, no colored text), and never could target
it.
