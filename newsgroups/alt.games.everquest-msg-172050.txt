Anyone have any info on this product.
It basically appears to be EQ with all expansions inc PoP but for the Euro
servers (although I read a review on Amazon claiming it was actually the
beta of a new game, I think that reviewer was a little confused) do you also
have access to the original US servers with it?
I remember Ubi Soft (UK Distributor) had an issue with the retail version of
PoP not going to be compatible US servers, for whatever reason. I didn't pay
much attention at the time as I was, and still am, in no rush to get PoP but
I have a friend who is using a Magazine account and would like to get the
expansions up to SoL (No bazaar makes life a little hard) and this is the
only version that seems to be available in the UK now.
