Hmph. Nothing like immature pre-teen mentality! :)  Its the same group
of twits who think being able to look up ascii extended codes on a
table and put them into their sigs somehow makes them 'l33t h4xx0rz'.

I don't know offhand how to do it, but if you are interested in doing
the legwork, pick up one of the alternative EQIM clients and take a
look at the raw item link format; I've been advised that one of them
can be configured to view the 'unprocessed link' as it appears in the
character stream. 

I'm under the impression its as simple as regurgitating it  back with
the 'url  text' changed. Odds are if you can figure out the parts of
an html href you'll be able to solve this 'great mystery'.

Real l33t eh?
