I agree but I had to chuckle.  It reminded me of an old Woody Allen line
that went something like...." I'd never want to be a member of a club that
would have someone like me as a member".

I too have been "recruited" numerous times to join guilds without them
knowing anything about me...or me them.  What's the point?  Assuming that
guilds  are for people with similar interests, ethics, playing styles,
underwear...whatever, you would think there would be some type of screening
process.

I notice I  never get asked by the more "established" guilds....I guess they
see what a moron I truly am.....LOL.  Seriously though, now that I've
reached a relatively higher lvl (31),  I'm beginning to think that finding a
guild that is compatible with me would definitely be to my
advantage........anyone looking for a slightly insane but terribly loyal and
dependable Wood-Elf  Druid please  /tell
