You may want to switch to a NVidia GeForce or ATI Radeon video card
since those are the chipsets that EQ says they support.

I, personally, have a GF2 MX200 in my OLD computer (VS440FX MB, that
old) and its PCI not AGP. It has given me fits at times, but has (for
some reason) settled down (probably until another big patch<G>).

You may want to take a look at the ATI Radeon 9500 or 9600 Pro AGP
cards. I hear (via Maximum PC) they support DX 9 and are not as costly
(maybe $130 - 9500 and $200 - 9600) as top of the line ATI 9800 Pro
cards ($400). They are also supposed to be somewhat faster than the
equivalent NVidia cards.

You might want to check what size power supply is in your computer. I
think that a 250 watt PS is about as low as you want to be (though 200
watts works for me right now) and 350 or greater would be much better.
