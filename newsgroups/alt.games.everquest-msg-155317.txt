> Any insights?

Just an added suggestion, not to diminish anyone else's suggestions 'cause
they're all good, but talk your nukers into getting within melee range (but
a step back from the MT) before casting, if possible (some critters have
nasty AEs so they'd be obvious exceptions).  So even if the wizzy overnukes
the critter isn't running all over the place to get to that wizzy.

Also the casters should keep in mind which of their spells have any sort of
knock-back (whether publicized or not...e.g. enchanter AE stun moves
critters though I don't think castersrealm says it).  If you're trying to
keep the critter in one place THEY need to watch placement as well.
