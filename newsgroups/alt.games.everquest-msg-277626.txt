That is my point, they have done nothing against it EXCEPT beat their drum 
about how they banned x number of plat farmers etc.

Then all of a sudden they do this, and start preaching how they are doing 
this as this is what the players want according to their research.

If SoE want to do this then fine but i'd wish they'd stop insulting their 
paying customers by trying to insist that they are doing this for our 
benefit.

Obviously they are a business and want to make a profit, but there are many 
ways to do this, sadly it looks like SoE are going the route that lessens 
the gaming experience for the paying customer.

What's next, how how a auction to decide what class gets fixed, they can pit 
the carpenters against the sages, whichever group puts the most money up 
gets the fix :)
