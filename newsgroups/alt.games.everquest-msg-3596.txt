As anyone who reads the box cover will know, you are buying the rights to
use the desktop interface. The fee -- a paltry $10 US a month -- gives you
access to Norrath and connects you to more than two dozen different world

you get for less than two hours of minimum wage, it would be a bargain at
twice the price.
