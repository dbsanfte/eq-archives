More-over, killing mobs quicker results in using less mana keeping the tank
alive.  Additionally, our cleric complained that the druid, who do pretty
crap DPS wasn't helping kill fast enough but complains the necro who does
massive DPS wasn't feeding her enough mana.

If the cleric is short on mana, the druid patch healing should have
*helped* and the necro doing more damage should have *helped*.

The cleric and the druid should have taken turns healing and medding while
the necro basically killed everything and the tank held aggro.
