   So, you'd like to get in one of those cool sports riots that you see on
tv, but you also like the comfort of your own home?  Now you get on the
action with a virtual sports riot!

   The graphics are crude, but that action fast paced and learning curve
easy enough.  Don't click if the idea of throwing molotov cocktails at
policemen offends you.
