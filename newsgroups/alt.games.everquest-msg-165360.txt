Hybrids are not "nerf canvasses".  Paladin, Ranger, and Shadowknight
have been buffed more than any other class.  Well except maybe Rogue,
the addition of the Evade skill changed the Rogue from something very
special that extreme masochists did to themselves online into a class
with sufficient intrinsic effectiveness to attract hordes of rouges
to play it.  Hybrids have been problematic to balance because of the
"multi-penalty" effect (aptly described in the OP of that particular
Monk bitch session), but we've never been the target of any serious
nerfing (exclude stupidities like the Thunder of Karana), because
we've never been powerful enough to bother with.  Now that we seem to
be roughly balanced with the other melees we could turn into targets,
but I don't see it happening yet.  If it does happen tho, my prediction
is that the Ranger will be the first target, BLs are still too new to
lose favorite child status and they and Rangers are the melees most
easily compared to casters.  And after the Monk nerf I'd say the
designers have made it fairly clear that no melee will be allowed to
be as effective as a caster.  Remember, you read it here first!  :-p
