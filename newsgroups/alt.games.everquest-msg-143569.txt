    What I see when I read Rich Waters' note:

    Whether they needed them or not.

    It is an attempt to change the current desirability of clerics, and
shamans and druids, to groups and raids. At present, it has made no real
changes to the raid desirability of any of the three classes, has made
clerics less desirable to casual XP groups, has made druids more desirable
to casual XP groups, and has given clerics a poor ability to solo. Thus, the
changes can be viewed as failures that will be migrated to Live servers
sometime soon where they will never be reversed.

    It's unfortunate this debate wasn't made public. Several suggestions
could have been made to stop this nonsense before it happened.

    The change that would have made us "balanced" would have been to give
clerics some form of utility that would make them desired by XP groups. Then
we would be balanced - essential for raids, OK for groups, poor at soloing.
Druids are currently sub-standard for raids, sub-standard for groups, OK for
soloing. Bringing them up to "OK" for raids and groups would have balanced
them. Shamans are essential for raids, OK for groups, OK for soloing.
Truthfully, shamans didn't need any changes - they are a blueprint for what
a good class should be.

    The raid-level heals being given to druids and shamans do NOT change
their raid desirability. This is the problem. If you want a healer for a
raid, who did you get before? A cleric. Who do you get now? Still a cleric,
because druids and shamans still cannot heal as well as one and
***versatility is useless in a raid environment***. No serious raid leader
is going to say "well, we could get a cleric to backup the CH chain, but
instead I'll get a druid because he nukes too!" He is going to get the best
person for the narrowly-defined job he needs filled.

    The chnages to druids, however, DO allow them to fill the role of healer
in casual XP groups. Since XP groups DO value versatility, this means that
clerics are replaced in casual groups by druids. Druids still outdamage
clerics, still offer more utility buffs (Camo/Lev/SoW/STR) than clerics, and
now are sufficiently good healers.

    This is the crux of the problem. If druids are "effective healers" in
casual group environments, they will be chosen as healers over clerics
unless clerics are given utility to compensate and compete with druids.
Clerics were given no such thing. They were instead given a DPS enhancement
that makes a mockery of what being a ****caster**** is all about, and
perhaps the most annoying mana regen buff in the game.

    Clerics are as entertaining to play as any other caster. While I don't
get the visceral "ooh, I nuke it good, big number" thrill a wizard might
get, I spend the same amount of time on my ass as he does and contribute as
much, if not more, to victory as he does. The five added spells for clerics
do nothing for our versatility. I still heal, just slightly more efficiently
when using direct heals. I still sit to regen mana, I just regen it faster
by standing every 24 seconds to cast Yaulp V. I still deal damage, except I
can replace a relatively inefficient nuke with relatively inefficient melee.
Big whoop.

    I will make the same suggestions I made at the beginning of the process,
with one added change.

    Give druids the AoE CE spell, making it a minor spell line of theirs
starting at level 51 or so with a group Celestial Healing. This gives druids
a unique raid role (combatting AoE damage in an efficient, low-aggro manner)
which is useful at all levels of the raid environment. Give druids the same
Heal over Time series as clerics, starting one spell level after the cleric
gets it. This gives them the same level of downtime/casual healing as a
cleric in groups without giving druids CH or a variant and taking into
account the sort of aggro a druid can withstand.

    Shamans are fine as is, although a castable version of Avatar might be
nice. ;-)

    Give clerics a new spell line, replacing the never-used
decreasing-over-time STR line they have now. It would be a series of group
buffs, reasonably low in duration, which give the buffed person a
magic-based damage proc. Think like Divine Might (in fact, having Divine
Might be the last buff in the series a cleric gets might be a good idea).
Adjust the proc rate/amount of damage to be comparable to (but lower than)
the damage from a druid's damage shield. This would give clerics a damage
output increase mostly confined to XP groups, as opposed to an increase that
makes them better soloists, and which is much more in line with them being a
support caster.

    Finally, give clerics Invisibility sometime in the 51-54 range. Please.
I'm tired of paying to not train others.
