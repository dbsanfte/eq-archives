Make a hotkey for Taunt and make a habit of using it all throughout a fight.
Use two single handed weapons unless you have a MOA2H (Mother Of All Two
Hander).  As a young warrior I liked the two hander I had because of the
nice crits.  I kept wondering why I always lost agro in a fight to the Monk
or Thief that was fighting near me.  The reason was that I needed a weapon
in each hand to keep the Mob's attention towards me.  I am not sure how the
code is written.  A caster that drops a nuke onto a mob can easilly get the
mob's attention and cause the warriors in the group to run around trying to
get the mob to agro back onto them but I also know that a warrior using
taunt and smacking a mob with 2 single handed weapons will keep a mob's
attention more than a single two hander.
