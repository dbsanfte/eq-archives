I thought everyone knew Alasdair was Eduin.  It was pretty well known when
he used to post here a lot, and I thought you were around long enough to
remember that.

I don't know enough about PoP and the higher end zones to judge his current
posts, but he used to have two characteristics that combined to make him fun
to watch, but annoying to argue with:

1. He was rather obnoxious.

2. He used to be able to back up everything with log parsing and
calculation, so was almost never wrong.
