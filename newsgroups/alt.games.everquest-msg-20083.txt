Well, sontalak is hardly a normal mob to be killing when you are raiding in
WW. I doubt he's been killed on most servers at all. I know he hasn't on
mine (never even been tried).

There are 6 of 'em.

Hmm, I've fought Ionat a lot, and I don't think he ever mezzed me. He is
fairly easy if you stack 15 buffs on yourself, cause then he is constantly
dispelling his own silence. Doing him with 2 and a half groups (which we
did a lot) is not really the way I would recommend. Just not enough
firepower to reliably bring him down...we'd lose a couple people every
time. Wouldn't have any other fatalities unless we were fighting another
valley dragon, and Jen Sapara showed up at the end (he has a real knack for
it) and started doing his single target 1500 pt grav flux on us. I hate
that guy.
