The Bazaar on Stromm is almost deserted.  Most traders are trying
to sell tradeskill items cheap, and not selling that much (not many
tradeskillers yet).  It's fun to see low-end tradeskilled items
actually selling to people though.

Stat jewelry is being sold already, but just the low-end stuff.

1-10 took me 8 hours, mostly due to lack of availability of low-end

Yikes!

Scraping up the plat to buy even low level spells is proving very
