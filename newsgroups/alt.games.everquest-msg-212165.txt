Regen is pretty much useless when you get Stoicism, no need to wait till you get
Torpor to see it as a waste of good exp... is what I meant.  I can see how it might
look like I was suggesting that Torpor is useless if you have Stoicism; but since
that makes no sense at all, I didn't really consider the possibility.

Very true, but even with mere Stoicism the slow crawl of hp regen and in particular
the small chunk that the extra 6 points per tic of regen that being a troll means is
a joke.  This means that for a shaman, troll regen is only noticable from 1 to 44,
and since thats a small fragment of the game (what, the same amount of exp as needed
to get from 59 to 60?) paying 20% exp for it for life is a harsh harsh price.  Of
course the OP starting the thread was talking about a SK, and he'd only have to deal
with normal scaling of the effect, which is bad enough but not outright slaughtered
at 44 like it is for a shaman.

In the pre POP era, an ability that is of some use till you hit the top level of the
game and get a rare drop spell might have been worth more, with POP's Incomplete
Heal shaman HP regen became of negligible importance earlier, but to me LOY really
puts the nail in the coffin by moving that bar back to level 44.
