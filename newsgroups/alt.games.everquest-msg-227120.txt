I think his point by "class appropriate"  was that it is an item that is
usually seen as good for some and not others, not that it was good for
clerics in particular.  My point was that it is wrong to beg a cleric to
come with you (in a non-guild group) but then impose the condition that he
not be eligible to roll on a perfectly sellable item.  IMO the warriors were
just being greedy.  Half of them probably intended to sell the cloak
themselves anyway.
