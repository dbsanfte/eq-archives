I always keep one of those on me as well.  However, the
Thurg gate potion takes a full ten seconds to cast, and is
very interruptable.  If it gets interrupted, you're screwed,
because (I believe) the potion is already used up and your
escape hatch is gone.

The LBP was a good "sure thing".  Now it's useless.
Hmm, I suppose I could hand them to beggars looking
for a handout...  /evil grin.
