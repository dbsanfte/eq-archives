Hi there,

Not sure if you verified it, but I would first make absolute sure that
it is indeed the new vid card causing the problem.  Try putting in
your previous video card just to make sure that EQ works fine with it.

Good luck!  :-)

PS- A friend recently got the G4, and EQ works great with it.
