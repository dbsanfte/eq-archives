Friday night I found out about Sony/verants anti-flood/spam filter for the
first time. UGHHHHH

Simply put you must wait 4 secs between messages on a particular channel.
This is generally not a problem unless like you use 'social' hotbuttons to
send the same multi line messages many times( as when you are trying to
auction multiple items.
I had always used the following format

/auction WTS  Spider Fur Collar
/auction WTS  FBSS
/auction WTS Velious Qwest GEMS
/auction WTS Rygorr coif, BP and greeves
/auction WTS Balde of Xalgoz 19 dam 40dly 10str

for the social.  Every time I would click on the button I made for the
social
I would see on my screen 5 messages   You auction WTS Spider Fur Collar, You
Auction FBSS

It turns out that because of the channel-flood anti-spam filter THE ONLY
THING OTHER PEOPLE SAW WAS THE VER Y FIRST LINE.

While I thought I was auctioning 5 items, really I was only auctioning the
first one.
DUH now it makes sense why I got so few tells on the things I was trying to
sell.  Unless it was on the first line no one new it was for sale.

I know there is a more efficient way to do this, but for the time I know
this works

/auction WTS  Spider Fur Collar
/pause 45
/auction WTS Velious Qwest GEMS
/pause 45
/auction WTS Blade of Xalgoz 19 dam 40dly 10str

This puts a 4 and a half second pause between /auction messages.
Done this way all three lines get transmitted

         I hope this helps others who never heard about channel flood
anti-spam filtering
