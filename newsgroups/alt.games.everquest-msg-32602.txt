I lot of people (I'm not sure if you're one of them or not) like
to claim that communism isn't really a bad thing, the problem (they
say) is that "real" communism just hasn't been "done right" yet
(or hasn't been "tried", the claim sometimes goes).

The opposite view, which I tend to agree with, is that all of
the "not successfully implemented communism" examples of the
past and present weren't just fumbled attempts, they were
*inevitable*, and there never *will* be "successfully implemented
communism", because communism simply goes against human nature.
It inevitably breaks down through lack of motivation of the
workers (who get just as much reward for goofing off as for
working hard), the inefficiencies of central planning (not
even a massive bureaucracy can keep atop the incredibly
complex and rapidly changing supply/demand issues of a nation),
and the way it rewards corruption at all levels (including
the fact that complete control of the economy
at the top naturally draws every scumbag who has a lust
for power, riches, or a wild-eyed Vision Of How Things Ought
To Be Run).

As the old saying goes, there's nothing more permanent than a
temporary government program.
