Okey, let's go back to the basics here... I'm sure you have heard of 
'Occam's Razor'. Normally, it's quoted as "of all available explanations, 
the simplest one is usually correct", but the original is closer to "you 
shall not multiply entities unnecessarily"; this is one of the basis of the  
scientific method.

Now, the way this applies to the question of the existence of God and the 
existence of the soul is: If all available evidence can be explained 
*without* resorting to entities such as "God" and "soul", these are 
unnecessary entities, therefore the burden of proof rests on those who 
postulate their existence. Scientifically speaking, you don't need to prove 
the non-existence of the soul; it is assumed not to exist, until someone 
proves its existence.

To wit, if you are talking faith, anything goes, but if you are talking 
science, it's believers who have to prove that the soul exists, not 
unbelievers who have to prove it does not.
