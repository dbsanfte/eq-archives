    The best XP in High Keep has been nerfed. On the floor upstairs from the
floor with the casino, there's an empty room behind a door over near the
locked door. That empty room used to have three spawns in it, all level 45
or 46, with one of the lowest HPs of any mob that level (Kunark era). The
spawns were either "a bodyguard", which usually spawned with a fine steel
two handed sword, or "an accountant", a wizard-class mob.

    Once you got to your high 50's, about the time the bards downstairs
became poor XP, you could single-pull from the room. On that floor is a
hallway shaped like a rectangle, with rooms in the middle. Once snared, a
mob could not run the length of the long side of the rectangle before a
wizard could get off a Draught. And because of the bad pathing up there, if
you got far enough ahead of them they'd turn around and head the opposite
way. So my server had wizards up there, racing to be first to level 60,
killing bodyguards around the clock. They were even wimpy enough that other
classes started getting in on the act, like the first shaman to 60 pulling
them and killing them with pet and DoTs.

    The pathing in the hallway was the "official" reason why they were
removed, but I imagine the real reason was because of how quickly people got
to 60 on them, just like level 50 and the Dars in Upper Guk. I wonder if
they were ever part of a quest.
