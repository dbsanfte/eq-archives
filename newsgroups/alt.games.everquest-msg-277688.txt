I hate this philosophy. It's one of the "features" I had the biggest 
problem with in EQ2, because it completely eliminates any sort of 
identity from the individual classes. All subclasses within an archetype 
end up pretty much performing the same tasks, just with different 
skill/ability names and graphical effects. I don't believe they each 
need to be equal in all their respective roles for success.

That sounds intriguing. I might suggest maybe 75%.

I don't have a problem with certain encounters requiring certain 
classes. I actually like that approach. What I *do* have a problem with 
is when that certain class is the same for 80% of the encounters.

Makes sense.

Not sure I agree with that, but I hear you.

I agree.

Absolutely. That's what drives us in EQ for the most part.

That's a given, IMO.

True, yet I'm not sure it is all that necessary to do so. Trivial loot 
code could go a long way toward making that a non-issue (just an idea, 
easy folks).

Sound advice, I'd say.
