They aren't essential, and that's what this subthread is about.  Lots of
warriors, clerics, ONE enchanter, ONE shaman and ONE monk are "essential."

Add other classes and things can go a hell of a lot faster, but that's not
at issue.   Unless you're saying that NO warriors, NO clerics but lots of
wizards (plus other non-essential classes) can do anywhere near the same
number of raid-level encounters then we aren't in disagreement.

My main is a 56 enchanter...pretty much superfluous in any raid if there's
another 54+ enchanter there, it's not like I enjoy the facts of life in
Norrath.
