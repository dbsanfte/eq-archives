Well, the "easy way" differs for everyone I guess but I went from 180 to 187
in about 45 minutes yesterday on level 1 and 2 in Kedge Keep. I would have
gone in further and stayed longer but I was relying of Dead Man Floating
(cast in Dagnors Cauldron as you cannot cast this inside) to negate the need
for air as I had neither fish scales nor an EB item. Tonight I am goign back
with fish scales...

As an aside, the mobs here were very easy and good experience for a soloing
Level 55 Necro.
