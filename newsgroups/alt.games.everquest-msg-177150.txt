That would only be a problem for a fairly brief while.  Once your skill
in a language gets to 20 or so you can usually understand without too
much difficulty something said by a char who has mastered the language
(the reverse is not true).  For combat communications you simply make a
chat channel and use that, no language issues in chat channels.

All the language issues aside, the "holy trinity" plus a mage is one
of the stronger groups you could make.  But, it is still just one of
many and it does have the downside of giving up the Shaman and his
best-in-game slows.  And in a size limited (and thus DPS limited)
group slow is even more important than otherwise because it'll take
you longer to beat down those tough mobs (same can be said of the
Enchanter's crowd-control abilities, you won't often be tank-mezzing
with a four man group unless you're fond of long downtimes and even
longer CRs).
