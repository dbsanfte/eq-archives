Well, as far as fantasy goes, my favorite to this day remains the
Chronicles of Thomas Covenant.  It makes most other fantasy works seem
like simple children's stories.  A heavy emphasis on character
building, personal redemption, and the consequence of action.  If you
can get over the main character being a complete and total bastard for
the most part of the first book, it's well worth reading.  However,
it's not really a "swords and sorcery" book, as the "hero" of the book
literally coudln't wield a sword if his life depended on it, and he
only uses his "magic" sparingly.  In fact, he spends a great majority
of the series dressed in a simple robe and barefoot.  Either that, or
blue jeans and a t-shirt..

As far as true swords and sorcery and adventure goes, my favorite
woudl have to be the highly underated and hardly heard of "Glory Road"
by Robert A Heinlien.  A magificient, original, unique story that not
only serves as a wonderful book, but also as a great intro to the
works of RAH.  And it's a very fast read, too.
