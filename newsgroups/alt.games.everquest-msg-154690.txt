Yeah, lots of people have dream character things. I prefer to just use
the gear I have in mine and not make a wish one.

I have some bazaar suggestions, based upon what you have. 
Sell that veil to a player, or more likely a vendor and get an
enshrouded veil or one of the even more expensive similar items.
Searching by shaman/face/hit points in bazaar then by price/name pulls
up some nice things. That is how my troll sk got the same gloves as
you dirt cheap ;)

My druid saw a much better belt than smiters.. really the few stats on
it are kind of moot. That spider one with 40 hp is probably better but
I saw one with 40 hp and 40 mana.. I thought it was clr dru shm but
can't remember.

Rather than plat jasper (wis, though you don't have the wisdom one in
your magelo ;)  ) or that other small wis ring, I'd use two vellium
fire rings for 6 ac and 65 hp, until you can replace one of them with
a shaddel bandit ring. AC and hp is especially important for shamans.

It looks kind of like you were going for a high wis/low ac druid like
kit, except for the BP. Its not going to work very well for much
longer. Shaman gets the beat down.
