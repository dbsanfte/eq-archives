Whining ain't the go, I do agree with you on that point.

On a larger issue I dont like the "get a life" comment that gets thrown
about these days whenever somebody complains about something in Everquest
(or computer games in general). Its a strawman tactic, very few people that
play Everquest are sport loving, beer guzzling joe sixpacks. The very people
that supposedly "have a life" because they dont use computers.

I consider I have a life, because I have an imagination and use it in
Everquest. Rant mode off.

Oh and its good to hear another Aussie :)

Pete
