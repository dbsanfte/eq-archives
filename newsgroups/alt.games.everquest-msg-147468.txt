"Rastus" due to the wonders of OE and Cascade lager managed to reply to Dan
rather emptily...

What he meant to say was:

WTF? You still believe in rampant, unconstrained capitalsim now the termites
are out and in full view of everyone? For fucks sake you proberly still
think Communism is some boogieman used to scare people with. The only flaw
with cummunism is that *it goes against human nature* so therefore will not
work in the application.

Human nature is deeply ingrained into fucking ones neighbour over to the
maximum possible degree for ones own personal gain. How does this gel with
the Communist ideal? It doesn't, therefore it doesn't have a chance of
*ever* working.

That doesn't mean that automatically rampant uncontrolled capitalism is the
only model left standing. Far from it, the current executive level scandle
after friggin scandle dispaly not the triumphant rule of uncontrolled
capitalism, but the need for it's reigning in just as surely as Communist
countries worldwide are finding out that Communism = Corruption = Oh fuck.

Guess what, Uncontrolled Capitalism = Corruption too....

Open your eyes, look around, your favorite lapdog has been busy knawing away
at your own balls for the last couple of decades whilst you have been
sitting back laughing at everyone else. Your own government knows it - why
the hell else do you think war is needed so badly?

What is the one thing that even every primary school student can tell you?
War is good for the economy and ideal smokescreen for whatever polital
agenda you may be pushing, whether it be Communism, Capitalism or friggan
Rastafarianism.

*waves flag around and accuses everyone not goosestepping as Un-Rastifarian*

Wake up, smell the roses. Even a nutcase like myself can see the writing on
the wall, whats your excuse?
