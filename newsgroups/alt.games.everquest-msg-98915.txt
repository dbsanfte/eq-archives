I am trying to find some information about the LEGENDS server experience.
If you have played it and hated it then please respond.  If you still play
LEGENDS then also please post a reply describing the experience.  I know the
39.95 a month price tag is high but if the experience of playing that server
is good enough I do not see that being too terribly over priced.  I can
remember as a 15 year old kid going to the local hobby shop every Sunday for
some Table Top D&D RPG playing.  For 5 bucks you could get in on a whole day
of gaming at that hobby shop.  We had a good DM and there was about 12
people in the campaign I was in.  So I was paying 20 bucks a month for that
and that was 15 years ago.

If you do like the server how hard is it to find groups?  If the server is
more of an UBBER server where the vast majority of the players are 50+ in
level then let me know as well.

Thanks.
