Remember ... a looong time ago ... my supposition that PoP was going to
raise the lvl cap from 60?  Remember how lots of folks said I was crazy ...
that it couldn't be done? :-)

From CastersRealm (sorry for the snip ... it's on the main page):

NEW SPELLS HINT AT POP CHANGES

A number of spells were on Test for a short while today hinting largely at
the raising of the Level Cap to 65 with the Planes of Power expansion.
There has been a lot of conjecture over whether the cap would be raised
since shortly before the Boston Fan Faire and even there no word was given
to confirm it either way.

However some leaks of info from the Test Server seem to indicate that the
Level cap may indeed be raised to Level 65.  Some theories are that this
raise will only be effective within the Planar worlds of the expansion i.e.
You would be Level 65 in the Plane of War but only Level 60 in Luclin or
Norrath.  We will all have to sit back and wait for further information to
emerge.

In the meantime here are some of the spells which were recently on the Test
Server (but removed after a very short period).  Note that these spells were
only on the Test Server, have since been removed, will most likely change or
may not go live at all and that some of the spell descriptions are at this
time only theoretical..
