A good idea, and one that's been proposed several times in the past, but as
someone else has said, it's impossible to do the way the game works
currently.

The items on your character are not stored on your character.  What's stored
is just a reference to a master item table.  Doing it this way saves a lot
of space in the database, but the tradeoff is that item customization
becomes impossible.

So all toolboxes are really the same.  Changing one toolbox changes all of
them.
