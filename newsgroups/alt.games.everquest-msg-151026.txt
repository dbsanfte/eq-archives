Well it's all a moot point somewhat, now that we have the Tom & Jerry
spell effects.  Except for that nifty ice comet look.  What an
entrance that would make for a social occasion!

Still, I suspect spell effects aren't what cause people to go LD.  I
don't see it taking up anymore bandwidth than someone simply moving
from point A to point B.  A single command is probably sent from the
server to your client, and your client does all the work of rendering
particles - in other words, it's not much data sucking up the
bandwidth.
