PvP with a little PvE. If you check out the site
[http://lineage2.universalrealms.com/default.asp] for more
information.

Supposedly Clans (Guilds) can own Castles and Hideouts (etc..). During
the times when they are vulnerable, (several hours at scripted times)
other clans can sign up to lay siege to other clans castles. Also
supposedly clans can come in to ownership of smaller things like
Hideouts by defending them from monsters (PvE). The thing that makes
it seem really cool is that once you take control of a castle you can
set the taxes (etc..) for the town under that castles control. Also
guilds can conquer other castles to eventually become ruler of the
world. Very interesting concept, I'm just waiting on the execution.
