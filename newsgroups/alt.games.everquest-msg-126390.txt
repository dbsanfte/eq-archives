First off, let me help keep this discussion in perspective. I find it
to be informative and engaging. We obviously have different views on
the subject. I doubt that either will change the other's mind, but I
feel that debate is always healthy.

Also, I am fully aware that I am prone to jump to conclusions and be a
bit judgemental. If I have offended by doing so, I apologize.

Now, back to the topic...

Drinking from the milk carton is a bad thing too, but I occasionally
do so even though I'm aware it is not the most sanitary thing to do.
What can I say? I'm weak.

Oh...uh, right...I knew that of course.

I agree with that point. However, it is so simple to avoid certain
actions which will certainly avoid a larger number of people. I don't
agree with the idea of "scrapping the whole project" though. I think
that is a defeatist attitude.

However, I would be surprised to see that. I am not a bit surprised to
find someone offended by foul language.

I don't think it's necessary to split hairs to make a difference for
the better, nor do I think the OP was remotely suggesting such.

That would explain everything. Ok, really, that was just a joke. :)

Good point. Just like many people find foul lanaguage to be offensive.
The fact that they are not direct personal attacks does not change
that.

True. It is the composer's task to make it as concise as possible.

I know what you mean there.

It is just easier to offend in some ways than others, that's all.
