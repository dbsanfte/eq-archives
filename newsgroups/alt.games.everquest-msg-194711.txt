Clerics, Warriors, and Enchanters suffer from this mindset too, believe it or not.

For exp groups, close examination has shown that a (high level) shaman can be much
more efficient than a cleric.  With Haste and Slow a shaman's wimpier healing can
be more than adequate to the task of keeping the MA alive, and his Canna/Torpor
combo more than compensates for a lower efficiency in healing.  The only other
serious job a cleric can do for you is rez, but if you don't die you won't need
that, and if you do, you can probably buy one pretty cheaply by clerics trying to
raise money.

Similarly, an Enchanter can be easily done away with by that same shaman; his main
tasks are haste, slow, and crowd control, but in many situations CC just isn't
needed, break a spawn or use a puller who can single pull and you never have to
deal with that.  Of course chanters also provide mana flow... except that KEI can
be purchased cheaply in the Nexus most any time, and lasts about as long as many
exp camps.

Now since the shaman is replacing two people, you can either get another DPS class
in, or split the exp one fewer way, either way this is clearly a better plan if
getting the maximum amount of exp out of your time is what is most important to
you.

Warriors certainly aren't needed for most exp camps, paladins and shadowknights
come close to the same damage soaking capability, and have better aggro handling
-and- some hybrid abilities.  SK in particularly are handy due to FD, see above
notes on getting rid of your chanter.

Since the SK can mean getting rid of your monk puller, he's also allowing you to
get an extra DPS guy or split the exp one fewer way.

These classes are "key" classes in raid situations, and decent enough in groups,
but only people who are, as you suggest, relying on common wisdom that makes them
"indispensible" would require them for groups over other possibilities, and the
-serious- min maxers won't take them at all unless there's nothing better
available.
