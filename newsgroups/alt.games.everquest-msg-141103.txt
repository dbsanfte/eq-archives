Since puberty, all I played in Pen&Paper RPG's
was rogues/scout classes.  It just appeals to me,
sneaking around, getting into places unseen,
feats not truely related to combat that were still
impressive to boast about over an ale or two.
Pre-Kunark, that was my biggest complaint about
the class in EQ...it just wasn't "roguish" enough.
Nothing used our special skills, and we weren't
exactly good at keeping alive, either (no evade,
no sneak/hide, etc).  The Burning Rapier quest
was actually pretty neat (although the weapon in
it's first form was HUGELY crappy..not even as
good as a Dragoon Dirk) because part of it invovled
picking a lock, maybe (depending on your "style")
sneaking through a couple of dungeons, getting
in and out of some places with a seemingly useless
bauble that was actually part of your quest...

Rogues today are masters of damage. Assassins.
It's not exactly the path I would have chosen, but at
least it IS a path.  Folks know what to expect now,
instead of what amounted to a really, really nerfed
warrior.  The only thing that I would like to see is
a few locked chests.  Maybe some mobs drop
locked items that you have to give to a bard/rogue
to pick to find out what's inside...it may be a couple
of black sapphires, or it may be a trapped case
with an AoE blast of fire.  Just something to make
folks feel a bit roguish that has nothing to do with
putting up the big backstab numbers or parsing a
log to find out how much you outdamaged your
best friend's monk by during a raid...
