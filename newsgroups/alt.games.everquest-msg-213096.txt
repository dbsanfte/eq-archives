    I assume a post to this newsgroup by the then-Vice President of Verant
is sufficient evidence of a problem that covered all users of a Creative
sound card (in this case, the SB Live series)? I didn't go looking for them,
but there have also been issues with sound like being able to hear every
sound in a zone. People used to ask me how I knew Velketor was up in Velk's
Lab when I was at the zone line, and I'd tell them that I could hear him
muttering and casting his damage shield spell.
