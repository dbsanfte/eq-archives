How will any other player that only wants to do one thing ever
advance?  (Well, obviously that depends on what that one thing is...)

Progression is not an end itself; it is the means.  Now if you want to
explicitly step out mechanical progression (ie level and gear
advancement,) I'll recant - progression in nonmechanical areas, such
as fame, 'flags' or affects on the world make perfect sense.
Fame/Infamy progression is, in fact, nearly impossible to avoid when
doing things truly 'worth mentioning.'

So it's the latter.

Personally, no.  Others seem to think so.

Quite wrong IMO.  It's the things just *beyond* that are worth
mentioning.

That's another matter entirely.  We are obviously talking past each
other.
