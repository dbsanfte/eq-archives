Write down his guild as one of the ones you don't want to be in, if
they so badly need people who cannot afford to be choosy... I have
never had any problems getting groups and friends independently of my
guild, but I guess some people figure it's impossible to hunt with
people who have a different guildtag.

A_random_guild_00 would be just as likely to lower your status with
"good guilds".

I spent my entire first life ( levels 10-39 last autumn, I knew I was
going to have to delete the character so why worry getting a
functional guild?) with a guildtag that was nothing more than a
decoration, since I never hunted with guildmates after I first met
them during a Crushbone raid/recruiting event they had, I left Faydwer
sooner than them and outleveled all but one other member within a week
or two. A couple are still friends of mine and now we're actually in
the same level range - but none of us are in the original guild :)
I spent an hour of level 10 this time with a recruited guildtag,
pretty much just for kicks. Checked the guild website after ended
playtime, wasn't impressed and left as soon as I logged in next night.

Guildtags can confer quite a bit of status, especially if you have the
wrong one. If you're comfortable doing your own thing, there's no real
need to find a guild until you want to do stuff you really can't
accomplish on your own/with a pickup group/with a random collection of
friends.  When you do want one, you'll want one you'll enjoy spending
time with and trust - and they shouldn't have to hunt YOU down.
