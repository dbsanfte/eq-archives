The game will run and be playable on a Celeron 300A, Voodoo3, 128meg of
RAM with a SB Live. Problems here will be you will use only those Luclin
models you MUST, the BAzaar is a nightmare that requires 3rd person view
and staring at walls and floor. Loading zones will take a while (30s to
1min, quicker if you are zoning back and forth acroos a single zone line
and longer if its a new zone or on Luclin or Velious and ambient sound is
your worst enemy. You Clip Plane WILL be set at minimum when you are not
in the Old World. Big Raids will be a hassle for jerking lockouts. All
under Win98SE with a broadband or 56k connect.

Upgrade to an SB Audigy and lots of the ambient sound problems (a techy
friend explained why and its something to do with CPU load but my brains
dribbled out of my ears about 4mins in) - useful for anymachine
apparently. Made zoning a little quicker in Velious only.

Adding a Geforce2 Meant I had a clip plane of sensible size, zoning was
faster on Luclin, and Kunark. Bazaar got easier. At this stage the
game became more than playable.

392 Meg of RAM and zonign was faster, lockups nearly completely
disappeared, new models became an option. The game was really good. If I
had to pick the 2 problems it was zoning time and big raids.

Now Im on an AMD2700, 512 RAM, Cable Modem, Geforce4 MMX, SB Audigy. ZOne
time is about 15-30 seconds wherever. All models can be on, I laugh at the
bazaar and PoK and occasionally wonder how I could describe the old
machine as playable......
