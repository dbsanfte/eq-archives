Not quite true.  I can give you a couple of meg of source and have you
compile the whole thing yourself.  But, if you don't *check* the
source, you still won't know what's going to happen.

I used to build stuff in a mix of BASCOM and Assembler.  You can hide
a lot of stuff that way, even if you give someone the source.
