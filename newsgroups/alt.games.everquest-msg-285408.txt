My best memory of EQ:

Myself and my roommate started new characters after sharing an account
for about 3 weeks.  A gnome mage and a high elf chanter.  We messed
around and explored and eventually met a paladin who knew a little more
about the game then we did...  I remember travelling from Faydwer to
Erudin and what a long, cool trip it was....  This feels corny, but it
really was an adventure.  When we discovered that Kerra village near
Erudin, we were enthralled.  We didn't know anything about Allakhazam,
so it was just this bizarre random zone.  We explored a little, killed
a little, just general playing around.

That period, though brief, is still my fondest memory of any of my MMO
playing.  There was a time before I understood "the game."  There was
no meta-game mindset, no outside knowledge of drop tables and spawn
rates.  It was real immersion.

I love WoW these days, but I do miss that blissful naive ignorance.
