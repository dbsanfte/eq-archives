    Here's an "ouch, owie, ick" story about VP from last weekend:
second-tier guild that used to be a first-tier guild, disbanded for DAoC,
and is now back, is in VP. They kill the dragon with the Bo Stick of
Trorsmang (or whatever that droolerrific monk 2HB is called), the Bo Stick
is there, but they get an add. The add is a split wurm, it splits in two on
them, TPW except for a camped pally and a feigned monk that already has it.
It rots, with the other monks on the raid pulling out their hair. Then,
because the wurms in camp were splits, they're corpse camped and have to
coffin. My guild sent a lot of condolence /tells.

    James
