}A cleric with the mana regen to handle it makes a great puller.
}The problem with this group (apparently) was the tards who couldn't
}pull aggro off the cleric. But its hard to imagine wtf they were doing
}if they couldn't pull aggro from a cancel magic.

See, that's the funny thing.  I've heard several times that cancel magic 
is very low aggro.  But then I've also heard several times that it's 
extremely high aggro.  I know that how aggroesque a spell is is very hard 
to quantitatively test.  I would suspect, from the difficulty the tanks 
had getting aggro off Tea that either (a) the tanks were incompetent, 
which isn't terribly unlikely, or (b) CM is actually a fairly large amount 
of aggro.

Anyone got any evidence to back up the low-aggro view?  Ie, other than 
"so-and-so said it was low aggro and he's always right"?
