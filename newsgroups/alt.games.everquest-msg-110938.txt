  As an ex-druid and a current tank, I have to say that I much prefer
shamans to druids in my groups.  Druids aren't that bad, it's just that
shamans are just that good.  Between Haste and Slow, shamans are more
effective at mitigating the damage a tank will take (in my experience) than
a druid.  Less damage is taken during fights so fewer heals are necessary,
which scores points for the shaman since they are about equal in their
ability to heal and dish out damage.  Druids can be effective in some
circumstances (vs. animals where pathing permits fear kiting, and perhaps
against summoned-type NPCs) but overall I've found shamans to be more
effective in groups of about any size.

  The main meaningful advantage that druids have over shamans is teleports,
which is nice, but if it wouldn't be enough to sell me if I were to start up
a new character.

  I guess I'm sort of anti-druid. :P  I think a cleric or shaman would make
a better compliment to a ranger or warrior.  A ranger can snare and cast
fear on animals, SoW, damage shield, ect... not as effectively or as soon as
a druid, but if a druid is with him all the time, s/he may not get much use
out of these spells, and it's a waste.  A cleric or a shaman brings a lot of
other assets to the table though.  In the case of clerics... you have fear
vs. all types of creatures (albeit not 43 second Fear), much better healing,
better buffs, and nukes that honestly aren't that much worse than a druid's
(and much BETTER nukes vs. undead.)  In the case of shamans, you have slow,
buffs which are more complimentry (in my opinion) to a ranger, most
importantly, Haste... plus Slow and MR debuffs and damage output that in
long fights is probably as good as, or better than a druid's.

  But they'll get by no matter what they decide on. :)
