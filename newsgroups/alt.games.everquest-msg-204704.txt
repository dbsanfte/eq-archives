As you have it there.

I would only consider swapping them if you are stealing aggro from the Tank
(without trying to)

Yes they can, look for ones with 40+ Delay for the full 2hder bonus (and
obviously as much damage as possible) maybe a Black Acrylia Halberd, these
are normally cheap niow, 40/48 +4Magic Damage (making it 44/48 if the mob
fails a Magic Resist) and procs Lifetap.
Most people prefer 1hders over 2hders as a run of misses with fast dual
wielding weapons doesn't (seem to) effect your damage output as much as one
with a slow heavy hitter.

I can't suggest anything that will take you to that level. Are you in any
sort of Guild? Could you start your Epic(s)? What will do you until, say 54,
will then want replacing at 55 and then likely again around the 60
mark...Fortunately as weapons get old the become cheaper so what you look at
dream about today you can afford tomorrow.
