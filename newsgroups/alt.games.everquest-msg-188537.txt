Do some google group searches on ranger and 1H and 2H, and see if there's 
any weapon that fits your needs.

Then check http://everquest.allakhazam.com for the weapon, and see the user 
comments on it, and the price. See if you can get a trusted friend (or 
guildmember) to go to the bazaar for you, to get it cheaply. Some of the 
best weapons are quested, or dropped from higher level mobs, that are SO 
cheap in bazaar.

Just yesterday I picked a tentacle whip which is 4 damage 25 delay for 
15PP, which isn't the best, but still quite fast, and has a nice lifetap 
proc to it as well.
Picked up a Tower Guard's Blade too, which is 16DMG 36 Delay, and has a AC5 
and STR+10 bonus to it, for 75PP I think. Not too bad to raise my skills 
with :-)

Just search some newsgroups, to find what you would like.
