  HEHEHE  great post.

    Once again we get to hear a senseless mindless assfuck tell us how jealous
they are that they're not American.  That's really it, isn't it?  Your assault
on my nationality is nothing new.  We're used to it.  Every day I work with
people from other countries tellin me how much America sux.  Well go home   we
don't need you.  Stop payin verant and go back to whatever it is your countrymen
do for fun.  Probably sheep.  If you get this upset with a damn game then you
obviously don't have the maturity or mental capabilities to handle the
"pressures?" of playing eq.  You're probably french.  No wonder you can't win a
war.  That is without America.  And as far as flaming goes,  these are
absolutely my first negative comments directed against a poster, but what the
heck     YOU'RE A JERK and I wish I knew who your character is so I could pull
trains allto you all day.

   How'd I do Biz   hehe
