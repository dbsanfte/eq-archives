Yes, indeed, you keep the seal.

The quest for the seal is actually independant of the shawls quest,
its possible (assuming you know the keyword to get the seal quest
started, that is) to skip the first and second shawls completely and
do -only- the seal.  But if you should happen to want the shawls
as well, you hand your second shawl in with the seal and get
the third shawl and your seal back.

One of the first people to do the third shawl commented that
he'd been reluctant to hand over his seal, in fact, it being so
good and the shawl, assuming (correctly) that it was the same
as the second only one step better) really wasn't all that impressive.

Happily that choice isn't necessary, if you want to do third shawl
that doesn't doom you to getting four -more- snow griffin eggs.

Hmm, one of my friends blew his baking roll on that souffle, by
the way, despite getting fish rolls to trivial.  Man would that byte!
