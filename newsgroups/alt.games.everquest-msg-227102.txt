 Soldiers of Madness and others seem to spawn out of nowhere

There a spawn points in the middle of many rooms, which can spawn SoM or
occasionally named.

The traps seem to be on a timer also (ie pop a SoM, kill it, then trap is
safe for however long the spawn time is approx 15 mins).  Dont know if they
can be disarmed.

There are a few named which seem to be able to spawn in any of the standard
mobs spawn points, and all of them (I think), have a fun illusion
proc...fight one and you will see :p (thats if you arent kiting etc).

No see invis aside from what was mentioned in the other post.  A good zone.
