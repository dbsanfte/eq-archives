Well I tried it and it 'almost' worked.

I had a friend log on to my accounts. He could access all my
characters just fine. I had him move all the characters that I
could not access to different zone than they were in.

I then was able to log into one of the characters but as soon as
I zoned, I got a disconnect and then I could not access them again.

The really wierd part is that I can access some characters and I can use
those characters to travel to the zones that the other non-accessable
characters are in. Very very strange.

What would cause that kind of a bug?

If its an isp port block why would some characters work and not others?
If its a zone problem, why would one character be able to access a zone
and others not? Why can all characters be acessed from a totally different
system and not mine?

Has to be an issue with the last patch, since everything worked fine
the day before and I made no chages to my system at all. The issue must be
some
conflict with my characters as stored on the server and combined when
downloaded
to 'my' system only. Right?

Well no response from any emails to Sony yet. Well I got an auto-reponse
that they recieved it.

Next things I am going to try:

1. Take system to my friends house and try on his connection.

2. Total copy from friends system.

3. Total re-install.

4. Call Sony.
