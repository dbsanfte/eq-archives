Thank you, Geoff.  I'm already familiar with Allakhazam's write-up.  They even
refer to the fact that there are seven of them standing around, waiting to be
slaughtered.  (FWIW, the lead explorer seems to be a random spawn).  However,
only three of them are visible on the ground floor.  I can't figure out how to
get to the other four.
