If actually true, that'd be cool.  But weren't these same things said about
the Zek servers 2 years ago, quickly to be found false?

AO paints a pretty picture, but I've seen this type of stuff before.  A link
to this picture:

DAOC says: Camelot will be team-based PvP, where characters will be able to
rise up to medium level without having to worry about being marauded by
high-level enemies. As the players grow in stature, they will be expected to
protect their realm from enemy incursions, as well as occasionally go on
raiding parties against other Realms.

Forced PvP.  And how much do you want to bet that those people raiding your
town will be 16 yr old boys in their 1337 uberguilds raiding NOT for
role-playing reasons, but simply to gank people?

I don't know...if I want to act 16 (and I occasionally do) I'll buy a PvP
game, but since I'm much older than 16 and don't have the patience to deal
with little kids (of any age) I'll stick with EQ.  There are jerky little
kids in EQ but for the most part I can ignore them.  In DAOC I can't.
