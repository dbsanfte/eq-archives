Back in the old days, when my main was a level 10 wood elf ranger (don't 
laugh everyone that didn't buy from e-bay had to be level 10 at one 
point). I had played around with many of the classes ,but I enjoyed my 
ranger. I was on my way back from Crushbone after not finding a group, I 
desided to watch the newbies on orc hill for a bit before I camped. I 
spoted a gnomish necro that seemed to have a aweful time keeping his pet 
alive, At lower levels pets tent to stay around the level or there 
master. I did a /who on him and he was level 8 or 9 but his pet was 
conning green, also he was shouting how he hated his class and about how 
he should be able to solo but his pet dies too fast. Well this peeked my 
interest so I walk over to him to see if i could help. I had played a 
nerco somewhat but found it didn't suit my style so i quit after about 8 
or so levels. I ask "What is the name of the pet spell your useing?" He 
looks over at me and said "Cavorting Bones, it sucks the pets don't even 
last more then 2 or 3 hits now!". I ask "Isn't that your level one pet 
spell?" and he replies "yes, i don't see how nerco's can solo". I then 
reply "why havn't you bought your next pet spell?", He then turns and 
looks at me and says "You mean there is other pet spells!?!?". Only 
thing I could do is walk off and laugh.

Also there was a bard last night in High Hold Keep, I was on one of my 
alts, my level 27 gnomish warrior. He was sure that he had no other 
spells that was worth singing other then selo's and jig of vigor. He had 
it in his mind that Jig was a MANA regen song!
