My beastord hunted them in the low 50's. Easy for me since I can tank them
(once my enchanter slows), and BL can chew through their HP pretty fast.
They suck for pets because of their low dps. I think my level 60 something
animation does more dps.
Best DC pet in oot is probably quaag maelstrom. I used him for a pet once
when we were farming for the druid epic drop.
There are some lvl 45 npc's in oot, but they are marked as uncharmable.
