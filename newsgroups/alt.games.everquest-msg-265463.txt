The main page of Google had a nice link in the center of the page, "Make a
difference today.  Find your polling place.(link)".  Clicking on it took me
to a list of links, one for each of the 50 states, (and DC) plus 3 general
links.

I had to use it actually, since my polling place was changed, (some years
ago apparenlty) but that change was not communicated to me on my voter
registration card. (which I recieved less than a month ago)  The sites
linked were *extremely* slow and overloaded, but they got the job done.
