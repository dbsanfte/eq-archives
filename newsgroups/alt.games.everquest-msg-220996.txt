Actually, he did lie about Monica.  I would have, too.  It's just not that
important of an issue compared to, say, telling fibs about why we should go
to war.

Actually, you said I would rather see her raped than be able to defend
herself.   am perfectly capable of protecting her without a gun.  A baseball
bat is just as effective at close range and I don't have to worry about stra
ys.  Also, tere's a much more satisfying thud and cruch as the flesh and
bone is pulverized.

It seems you have problems with women.  It looks like either you hate them
or resent them.  I'm not sure which.  Last time I looked, a pussy was a
rather nice thing.

Oh, and I never did resort to the name-calling that you seem to get off on.
However, I will now say that you are a narrow-minded, hate-filled bigot that
seems to get off on spreading lies intended to distort the truth to your own
way of thinking.  Truly, you are a sad little thing worthy of pity (though
ridicule would be fun, too).
