What about all the armchair athletes who cant seem to go a day 
without watching some game or another? I can remember at least 2 
years working for one company when they brought a tv in and 
plugged it in to catch the world series [american baseball] and 
took turns going in and watching it...the other ladies and one 
poor lonely fegeleh who *wasnt* into sports [or didnt want to 
watch his men running around in tight pants...] had to do 90% of 
the call volume coming in=\ if THAT isnt addicted, I dont know 
what is.

Personally, when I used to avidly take part in the football 
pools, I picked my winners on teh basis of a city I liked, a 
helmet graphic I liked or a spiffy mascot. I also used to win 
about 80% of the pools...only sports based thing I did was ask my 
father or one of the guys to bring in the sports page so I could 
check to see if my list of teams won.

I would much rather play sports than watch them, and when I rode 
dressage and steeplechase I was practicing about 4 hours a day...
