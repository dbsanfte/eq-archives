That's because it's been out for a while now, so the graphics system is
written for a fairly crappy minimum spec system. Don't worry, an
expansion, Everquest: Shadows of Luclin, is due out in December which
will include a completely new graphics engine, so it'll look prettier
once you install that. Check out everquest.station.sony.com for
