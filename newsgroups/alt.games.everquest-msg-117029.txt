Well, thanks for all the info, I guess I'll be moving stuff to a twink to 
store it for now.  I'm sure one or two of these pieces are tradeskill 
stuff, but I figure being a bard ensures carpal tunnel, so I don't need a 
tradeskill.
One question though, you refer to *something* as broken, which I infer to 
mean that you feel that CT is broken.  I wish more people felt the way you 
did, because I'm seeing 3 and 4 groups in CT every time I'm there.  Sure 
one group is idiots fighting at the zone line, but there is an almost 
constant camp at the portal, at the second maze camp, and in the sewers.  
I'm even seeing the price on the FT3 boots drop, glad I sold mine last 
week, mwahaha!
