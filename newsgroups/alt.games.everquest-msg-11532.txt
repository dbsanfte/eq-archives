Ah, watch what you're calling a "container."  A flask of water *in EQ* isn't
a container, and you can't fill up a backpack with just the water.  You can
fill it up with dozens of flasks though...but you can't drink out of the
backpack.

Do you sometimes drink Jack Daniels by opening the top of the case and
lifting up all those bottles just to drink from one?

What a useless thread, huh? :)
