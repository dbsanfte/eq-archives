/shrug

It's simply amazing how fast he levels while he still joins on raids and
such. His current hunting ground is quadding in CS which, at least at 55 and
56, yielded about half a blue or so per quad. Considering 3 quads per hour
(very conservative) he still needs just 50 / 1.5 = 33.3 hours to level.
Considering 20 hours playtime per week (again conservative) that means about
a week and a half for a level.
Now I know he did quadding in CS even at level 53 and 54 which means the exp
must've been phenomenal for those levels. If he only spent a single Sunday
(8-10 hours) and cranked up his kill rate (with a C2 for instance) he would
be half-way through a level.
