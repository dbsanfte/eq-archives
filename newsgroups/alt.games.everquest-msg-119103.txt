Cite please?

Oh, and how convenient that you snipped the rest of his post, quote:

"They most assuredly can listen in on guild chat. Once we got trained
in TOV, then trained again as we were CRing. The GM who responded to
the petitions was talking to us and responding to us on our guild
chan. All it'd take to listen in without letting people know would be
to go invis to players."

Which part of "The GM who responded to the petitions was talking to us
and responding to us on our guild chan" was too difficult for you to
understand.

You're mighty quick with the insult, and slow with any useful response
there DT.  Been studying at troll school?
