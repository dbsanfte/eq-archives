And just to expand on this, when I first jumped into WoW I had the
same impression... no coordination, everyone whacking away, etc etc.
But thinking back, that's *exactly* the way it was when I went into
EQ... everyone running around like crazy, your group dispersing to the
4 winds chasing whatever mob was closest.  No one had a clue about
crowd control.  

The thing you forget is that even if you start a level 1 EQ char now,
the people you are playing with have level 60s and 70s and know how to
play, right from the beginning.  In WoW, it isn't till you get into
30's or 40's that people have learned how to really operate in a
group.  But at those levels and above, there is the same level of
coordination that you see in EQ.
