Compass????  Someone did give me one once, I eventually sold it.  It took up
valuable space, and was never used.  Learn to use /loc.  Of course, now,
with a decent sense heading, everyone gets a compass anyway, and it works.

I have some resist gear, some gear to swap around depending on whether I am
soloing or grouping, and that's about it.  The rest is just crap that I
don't have room in the bank for.  The life of a tradeskiller.
