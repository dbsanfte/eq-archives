Lol, you must have extra-sensory perception then. There is absolutely
nothing in the original post that indicates the poster was aware of what may
or may not happen when one hits ALT-TAB in a Windows application. He was
hitting ALT-anything to see what happened. Just because YOU know what
ALT-TAB typically does, does not mean than anyone else does. I know from
experience, dealing with literally hundreds of Windows users a week, of all
experience levels, that the vast majority of users a) rarely use other than
a mouse for any operation other than those that REQUIRE typing and b) don't
have a clue about any of the shortcut key combinations, especially ALT-TAB
(most of them don't have more than one application open at one time anyway
(i.e. visible on the task bar), they will close one in order to use
another).
