The quest NPC's in Erudin are on the Erudite caster's faction
groups, which can be raised by standing at the dock in Tox
and killing the wimpy necro every time he spawns (and he respawns
quickly).  Save the special bones that he drops, and once
the Erudin Mage guild no longer wants to rip your head off,
hand the bones (one at a time) to the head of the Mage guild
for further faction increases.  On the other hand, this may
possibly lower Paineel necro faction, which wasn't a concern
for me, but may be for your necro.

However, there are wandering guards in the Palace area, so you
also need to increase faction standing with them.  I'd have
to go look up how, since I was already ok with them and didn't
need to work on that.  I believe wiping out hordes of things
in the Warrens will help both Paineel and Erudin guard
faction standings, but don't quote me on that.

As for High Keep, kill tons of orcs or gnolls in High Pass
(at the Kith or EK zone lines respectively), for good
faction with the HP/HK guards, and collect their scalps 
to be handed in to the appropriate guard for FP Militia
faction.  Then head into HK to collect Left Goblin Ears
(don't ask me where the Right ones vanish to) for more
FP Militia faction.

But the Inert Potion quest is definitely the fastest, if
you can get in good with the Erudites so that you can do it.
