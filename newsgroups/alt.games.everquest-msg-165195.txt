I'll agree with the soloing bit being a lot easier when you don't have 
the time or inclination to sit around LFG for hours, but maybe you're 
missing the part where everyone is pointing out what would happen if 
that jboot camp WAS easier.  People would farm it, constantly.

And since the original poster admitted they wanted it not for the jboots 
but to suck money out of some other class not lucky enough to get sow, 
I'm not exactly sad to see him storm off in a sulk.
