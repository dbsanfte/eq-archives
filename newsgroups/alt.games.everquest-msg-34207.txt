Hold on there Hoss, someone twisting your nipple there? Where did I
"berate<ing> people for exercizing their right to keep the fantasy
environment from being spoiled by immature jackasses in what little ways
they can?"

You  know, getting things this wrong in public can really make you look
stupid. I think you have me confused with someone else.

I was going to give you the benefit of the doubt on the first mistaken
identity thing, with this...

OK, you be beyond dense then, right down there with rocks. I hope you take
real offense to that, it was meant to be offensive. I normally don't have to
tell people when I am trying to offend them, but you might just be so stupid
as you displayed here<2nd offense in two comments> that I wouldn't want to
get you confused.

By all means make a few more stupid comments. This is the best EQ associated
laugh fest I have had since "Irma".
