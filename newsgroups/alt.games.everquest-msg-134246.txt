Open Zone Alarm.  Find the Everquest.exe file under listed PROGRAMS in
Zone Alarm and delete it from the list.  You will now see an older
version of the Everquest.exe file listed; delete it. Repeat until no
older version of Everquest.exe appears. Next time you run
Everquest.exe and the dialog box pops up, add it to the list as you
described.

Apparently Zone Alarm's list of approved programs reaches a limit
after a while.  Since Everquest.exe is frequently patched, this
problem happens.  Clearing off the older patches of Everquest.exe from
the Zone Alarm list solved the problem on my computer.
