Heh... but then that would apply to in game transfers too. If you give
me 500 plat for an xxxx... you are giving me 500 plat... which you
just stipulated you don't own and isn't yours to transfer to another
party. I am another party, and you are transfering it. ...

If I stand in the PoK and offer to give 1pp to anyone who wants one,
then am I violating copyright? According to you I am taking Sony's
protected IP and *giving* it to absolutely anybody who wants it for
absolutely any reason at all. 

For any other copyrighted work this would be an undisputable copyright
infringment...  in this case I'm willing to bet my account that its
perfectly legal... and that ergo: Transfering plat is not protected by
copyright.

You can't have it both ways. Either its a copyright violation or it
isn't.

I do not agree that selling plat is a copyright violation to do so.
Just a violation of the Terms of Use, 'I agree'd to the terms of use
not that it was a copyright violation.
