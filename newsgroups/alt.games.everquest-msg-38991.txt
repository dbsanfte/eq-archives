And back in the old days this might have been a reasonable assumption.   Back
when everyone was all hot to get thier last name the moment they hit 20.
These days it doesn't mean anything, so not everyone bothers.   I have a 54
warrior, 28 cleric, 24 druid and a (retired) 34 paladin.   None of them have
ever had last names, nor will they.
