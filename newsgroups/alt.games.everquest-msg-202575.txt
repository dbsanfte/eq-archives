I understand exactly what you are saying, you are the one who is failing 
to understand here.  Sony, you know, the people who own and opearate 
Everquest, decided a long time ago that EQ is a multiplayer game where 
they want to heavily encourage players to group and play together, and 
they want to discourage not doing so.  This fix of group buffs is just a 
step they have taken to reinforce that.  I understand perfectly well that 
you don't like that, and are unhappy with it.  Tough, go play a game that 
suits your playstyle.
