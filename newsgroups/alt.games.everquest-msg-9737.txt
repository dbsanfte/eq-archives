Erm, this could take some explaining.

Melon found a post of indeterminate age, from Bizbee to another NG, I dunno,
alt.givemecancer.now or something a smoking NG anyway. He posted a copy of
this post here under the title of "Why Ron always is alone..." (Ron is Biz's
real name, apparently) in an attempt to, dunno, again I'm stumped, guess it
was a vain attempt that Biz would look bad in his opinion...then you replied
and staunch opposition to Biz's opinion which was never actually expressed
in any forum other than a smoking one. So the troll was really Melon and you
just made his post worthwhile.

That's why I found it all so funny, it was a floundering attempt to stir
trouble and it somehow worked, who'd have guessed?
