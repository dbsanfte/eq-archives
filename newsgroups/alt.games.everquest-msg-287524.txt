Looks like a brave step and one I'm happy with. Family life (2 children, 
husband, cats and a full time job), means my time availible to wait on raids 
forming, scratching because somebody didn't listen to instructions, waiting 
to reform only to loose to main mob because lag dragged the main healers 
down, has never been condusive toletting me get into the keyed zones.

As "the warf rat" says, it would be nice to see what my subscription fees 
are being used for by seeing some of these zones. Seven years in the game 
and there are some I've not been able to get to - so perma camping twink 
farmers asise, these open zones can only help support the non-raiding crowd 
and the benefitsdownfalls to the ubber guilds/players will be minimal, so 
"grats" SoE for a decent line of supporting all your fee payers.
