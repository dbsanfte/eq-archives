this is in reply to both Dan and Paul.

Ok so the mob (or mobs?)  is whacking you the chanter, and you're in need of
a heal. Couldn't you just color flux then  mem blur,  mez or root ? (i dont
know if there's an equivalent of these spells at the high end, my chanter is
only 18, but loving it so much, made him my main >) )

Or is this what tends to happen.... you're kept alive untill mob agros on
tank?

Cheers.
