You're missing a big advantage if you've put away one AE stun for the other.
Although it's not possible to have a critter 100% stunned with just the 2
stuns you have right now (err, if you have 3, then it's now possible) it
comes in damned handy when trying to take control.

Casting your level 4 stun gives you time to cast your level 20 stun which
gives you time to mez safely (not to mention the advantage the AE has in
stunning the tank's target if your target and theirs is close enough
together).  Bypassing your level 4 stun makes it harder for you to get your
level 20 off.

Still, using ONE stun is better than a lot of enchanters I know who don't
mem ANY.
