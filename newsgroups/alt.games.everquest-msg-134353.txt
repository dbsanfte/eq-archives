I used to wonder that myself.  But it was keeping me up nights ... giving me
worry lines.  So I stopped.

And, if that's actually going to be the case and new Vah Shir will look like
old Kerrans, I still wonder why there would have to be an additional patch
to make it work.

So maybe I'm wrong.  Been married 16+ years ... long enough to know that I'm
wrong more than I'm right.
