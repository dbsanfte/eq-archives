Well first off I think your going to have to upgrade your card if you
even want to try and run Luclin.
The ATI 128 has, if you have the Pro model,32MB, if you have the
standard only 16MB.
Go out and get a Geforce4-440 , they are about $100 now a days.
And make sure you have at least 512MB of RAM in your rig, or forget
Luclin..Period.

ATI, by the way has a "trade your old card for cash" thing going on.
Not to sure about how they work it but check it out if you want..
