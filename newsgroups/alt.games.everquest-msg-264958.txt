Funny, I feel exactly the opposite, for the same reasons. I would 
personally hide all the stats (going as far as encrypting all client-
server communications), and get as far away from numbers on the 
interface as possible.

To elaborate on your example of a warrior with decades of experience... 
he would do equally well with any two weapons of similar quality, any 
small difference between them basically obliterated whitin minutes of 
use. I'd much rather like to see things such as looks, roleplay and 
personal preference take precedence over +2 to strength or +10 HP when 
it comes to choosing a weapon, unless of course the difference is 
noticeable in play, rather than in parse.

Of course, the lack of hard numbers to refer to makes commerce more 
difficult, but again, I see this as a good thing. The things that should 
be used as reference for the perceived value of a weapon should be where 
or who dropped it, or alternatively what it's made of and by whom, and 
of course how cool, elaborate or expensive it looks. And yes, you may 
find that you don't perform noticeably better with it than with your old 
weapon, so well, you sell it on and chalk it up to experience (the real 
kind, not xp).

I do feel, quite strongly, that EQ is pathologically obsessed with 
numbers (starting with the level system), and while it's in the short 
term one of the reasons of its addictiveness, it's also one of the 
reasons why people end up so burned out with it.
