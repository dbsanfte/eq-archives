Errrr - yes, it was.  I didn't realize I gave the impression it *wasn't*.    
I honestly wanted to thank in public the individual who stopped and took 
time out of his game to give us a hand.  I've also been in groups camping 
dervs when high-levellers came out of nowhere and *killed* the dervs 
popping up.  What this got them, I'll never know...

Actually, I saw a high-level advertising for derv groups today.  I think 
they were around the 24 level.  I don't think even *Dorn* would give exp 
at that level... would he?

And, on another note, I have a question - tonight I was in derv camp 1 
and there was a dark elf and a caster in the group that refused to get 
involved when fighting dorn because of faction changes.  Well now, I 
don't blame them, but otoh the rest of the group died trying to take him 
while two people stood by and said "sorry, faction."  Why not take one of 
the other two camps and leave those spots open for someone who can jump 
in if need be?  It's a shame, because it was a different group the first 
time Dorn popped, and we took him with very little trouble at all.  But 
the second time, we got creamed.
