Shaman vs Druid PL .Sorry a druid wins hand down for the following
reason.Shamans big thing for Pl is slowing mobs for tank classes.Druid just
puts on normal buffs and DAMAGE SHIELD.You can have 5 or 6 mobs beating on you
at once and with chloro a little healing and damage shield kill them all at
once only making sure you hit each one once.
