It occurred to me that one of the few pieces of crafted armor I'm still
missing is the vambraces. Going to be looking for new hunting grounds
for me and my 32 cleric partner soon, as the Paw gnolls are getting way
too green way too fast for my (now) 39 warrior. Got me to wondering,
could the two of us tackle griffons with any decent chance of success? 
My warrior has about 1500 HP with the normal buffs I have on, and all
the melee skills that I normally use are at or near maxed around 195
(except disarm, which I'm finding a real pain to get up to even 150, but
that won't matter on Grif's anyways.) The cleric has the normal full
complement of healing/buffing spells for a 32 and average mana
pool/wisdom.  Doable? Or will we be toast? We've killed some sand
giants, hill giants and spectres this way, but I understand the griffons
hit like a jackhammer.
