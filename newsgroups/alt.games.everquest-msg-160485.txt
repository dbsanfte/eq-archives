Our worst was when a guildleader wanted to get some help on
something she was working on, and one of our members (who was
feeling cranky that night) meant to do a tell to a friend
and instead she did "/gu Sorry, I can't, I have to go do a guild
thing to stop the whining".

OOPS.

What made it even worse was that the guild leader really wasn't
being whiny, and the mistell'ing member really didn't feel that
she was, she was just being melodramatic in private.
