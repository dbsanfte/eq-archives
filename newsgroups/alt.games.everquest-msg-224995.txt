Hmm, well, which is it then?
And specifically what impact has LDoN had?

On Saryrn, it feels like its a bit of a mixed bag actually. There is some
element of increased money supply (the average player has more plat to spend
in the Bazaar, creating inflation which raises prices). But the influx of
LDoN item drops has created drastic deflation at least for some types of
gear -- pieces I sold quickly for 1,000 or 2,000 a month ago now don't sell
for half that much.

Overall it feels to me like more prices have dropped than risen (though
again, not evenly -- the supply of good H2H weapons hasn't increased any,
believe me). The steady trickle of new layers of top-end planes gear keeps
slowly-but-steadily devaluing stuff that used to be considered top-end.

I don't see any sign of a sudden influx of plat into the server from this
"shark bug" or whatever on another server. Nor does LDoN seem to have
drastically increased the money supply, because LDoN cash loots are nice but
not shocking.

I thought LoY would be highly inflationary, actually, once I discovered what
a plat-farm Dulak is for groups in the 40s or soloers 50+. Spent the low 50s
soloing there myself, raking in the cash faster than I ever have in Rathe
Mountains or LDoN. But for whatever reason, Dulak has not yet really caught
on widely for that purpose at least on Saryrn -- some people do go there but
its never crowded.
