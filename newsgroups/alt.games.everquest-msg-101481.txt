Just now reading Victor Klemperer (a cousin of the conductor)

from 1933 I have got to Jan 1939 when I had my third birthday

what it felt like to be the butt of racism in Germany.

He was a professor and academic  and a writer in Dresden and survived.

very well translated and edited
I cannot stop reading this book everyday any time I have a few moments to spare.
