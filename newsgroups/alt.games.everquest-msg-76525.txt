Power leveling is a bad idea. Why? Well in EQ you skills get better the more
you use them so if you power level  your skills dont not increase at a rate
that you level does. So early on it is important to do your own leveling.
You can do your first 4 levels in under 4hours once you know how to play.

BTW Power leveling is where you get a player to heal you and buff you while
you fight a mod that cons red to you. Its not a good idea at all.

Goto the nearest safe zone for you and bash all blue monsters you come
across, loot all the stuff they drop. Sell it and when you get enough stuff
but a better weapon, or loot one. And upgrade your armour, at lvl 4+ start
looing for people to fight with.

Do some of the newbie quests for some experience too. Good luck!
