Ack, no.

Your primary hand has a *much* greater effect on your damage than your
secondary hand.    At level 45, putting the Kunzar Kujuch in your primary hand
and downgrading your secondary hand to the 10 / 29 Blackened Alloy Longsword
gives you about 60 damage per minute more than downgrading your primary to
Icetooth claws and putting the Kujuch in your offhand.

As for how to add an item to Copelands, simply start the program, click on
File then select "Edit Weapon File" from the menu.   Hit the "New" button.
