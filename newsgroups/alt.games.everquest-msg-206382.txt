No, with two exceptions.

1. They have the ability to have things not drop if the encounter is
"trivial" for you.  That ability was introduced when they added The Warrens,
and it was used there.  Later, they turned it off.  I don't think it's on
anywhere now (on regular servers).

2. There is some strong evidence that they can have quests change the loot
on spawned mobs.  There used to be a quest that started in Befallen, that if
you followed it, led you to Qeynos Hills.  If Pyzjin was up and you did the
things that the quest story told you to do, you'd get a GBS off her.  If you
just killed her right away, not doing the things first that fit in with the
story, you'd only get it rarely.  Befallen has been changed a lot since
then, and I have no idea if any of this stuff is still actually in the game.

There's also a Velious quest that involves a scripted encounter, and if you
do things according to the story, you get a quest item off the final guy in
the fight.  If you kill him at the wrong time, you get nothing.

Other than those two encounters, and the trivial loot stuff, I've not heard
of any place they change the loot once the mob is spawned--it spawns with
its loot already determined, and that's what you get, no matter how you kill
it (rumor was once that killing bears with blunt weapons gave a better
chance of a high quality skin than killing them with a sword) or how high
level you are (well...there are high level spells that instant-kill a mob,
and those don't leave loot, I believe...but that's a special case, since
they don't leave a corpse either, I believe).

Bat wings are around 2 gold a stack in unlimited amounts from merchants
in most caster supply areas, and in East Commons.  Killing bats for the
wings is a major waste of time.  Bone chips are the only common spell
component that you actually need to kill mobs for.
