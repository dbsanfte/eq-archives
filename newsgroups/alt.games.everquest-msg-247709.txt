Tricky to find, but worth the effort. Find a Barbarian Shaman who can imbue
Ivory (no other will work) and have him imbue a stack for you. Carrying this
stack, go to PoK and take the book to Overthere. Enter and about 50m south
of the zone-in is a large greenish rockpile. If you click on the rockpile
*after* having Grow cast on you by an Iksar Shaman you will be ported to
Meetmedere in the middle of a PvP zone. Find the grid station to the East
and enter it after typing the sequence "Notum Scrotum". You will enter with
a special set of grid terminals available. Take the one 2 floors above you
called "Caer Benowyc". Enter, then run south along the road until you reach
Castle Sauvage and click on the gate switch to enter. Before the gate is
open, drop some Mandrake Root and Ginseng on the ground and type the phrase
"Extinguish Firewall with Rainz". When the gate finishes opening, a large
Lugian will be fighting a Drudge in the entryway. Debuff the Lugian with
Fire Vulnerability X, buff the Drudge, keep it healed and make sure that it
kills the Lugian. *After* the Lugian drops, kill the Drudge and loot the
"Libretto d' Fini". Take the libretto and give it to the statue of Aradune
Jacobs sitting inside the castle.  A small British man named Austin will
spawn and after a short story about an epic battle between a Designer Dragon
and a dragon tamer from Aden, he will port you to the zone. After a short
intermission the Fat Lady will start singing and you'll be presented with a
universal account cancellation key. Write it down.
