At least with casting skills, there are relatively painless ways to
catch up your skills that actually make it easier at higher levels. The
best I've found is having a freind with a bard group with you and play
mana song while they go out shopping or something for a few hours while
you endlessly cast the lowest, cheapest spell for that skill level.

Melee skills are another matter, but as long as you try to keep them up
a bit you can always catch them up between 45-50 when they dont raise
normally at all because they are maxed. As it gets slower to level in
this range as well, even with damage sheilds, it takes relatively longer
to get each level and you can switch in your weak weapons to catch them
up. I powerleveled a warrior to 51 or 52 with my druid before starting
to group and his 1hs, 1hb, piercing and 2hs were maxed by 50 dispite his
only having about 5 days played at that point. Taunt, defense, dodge and
parry were maxed and riposte was close to max as well. 2hb was weak at
only 170 or so but I caught that up later when I got a nice 31/30 2hb to
work with. Part of the trick is shopping for at least one really fast
weapon for each skill. Back when I did it, Nathsar greatsword was a
great 2hs weapon with a nice fast delay and relatively inexpensive. 1hs
and 1hb weapons in the low 20's are also easy to find and a shaded
dagger is a fast cheap piercer. As thorns does most of the damage when
powerleveling the damage of the weapon isnt as important.

I'm glad to hear that. I haven't played my warrior for a while because
the taunt situation is just too frustrating to be fun right now, so I
can sympathise with his problems with the warrior.
