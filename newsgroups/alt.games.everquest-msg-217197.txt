I decided to give my cleric a break tonight and play my beastlord.  Simple I
thought.  Get in there hit, cast some slows, have my pet hit, relax.  Not group
leader, not main tank, piece of cake.
Everyone was warned about the boxes.  
So my beastlord has now been sitting in BB for 40 minutes waiting for Haunting
Curse to wear off.  I've /ooc'd for a cure please, willing to donate, yada
yada. I'm not the only one.  There's 4 of us sitting there. 
SOE did this expansion to promote grouping.  Then they put a "feature" in there
that allows some complete *asswipe* to do a *tiny* *stupid* thing and 6 people
get to suffer for it for an hour.  
AND our cleric went to check and the cure curse spells costs *TWENTYFIVE*
adventure points.   Wake up SOE!
Ok, I'm done.  Guess I'll just sit here with EQ in the background reading
newsgroups the rest of the night since I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE!
