I can live with that. Though I don't see why we can't just stop at 'he 
might not know something'... that's a long way from being wrong.

I remain unconvinced he is personally involved in executing or even 
damning anybody.

Insofar as he created the universe, whether or not he's omnipotent or 
not seems moot. What precisely could a 'more powerful' being do with 
respect to us?

Wavhing your hands saying 'but he's more powerful' isn't terribly 
constructive

First, I remain unconvinced the creator of the universe has an ego 
problem that causes him to desire to be worshipped in the first place.

Second, perhaps the whole point of the universe was to create something 
outside his control. Perhaps that is the most difficult task a so called 
'omnipotent' being can undertake...

Odd... 'my God' isn't required to be omniscient. Its far more relevant a 
question than you seem to think, because most of your argument 
presupposes that this God have characteristics that I find unnecessary.
