I agree with you but the problem with PvP is the ability to twink low level
characters, a 6th warrior in patchwork and a bronze 2 handed sword is not
going to stand much chance against the same level in full bronze and an Axe
of the Iron back (and lets face it, that is nothing compared to some of the
twinks any of us have seen or even made) Also, I think they'd need to apply
some kind of faction hit if you attack and kill someone with out first
offering a challenge and them accepting, to disuade people from just hunting
others to ruin their game, this won't stop it but if someone wants to play a
murderer they'd then be treated like one.
There is no way to stop twinking, that is short of some serious re writing
of the game engine, even limiting players on this server to having one
character per account, you can still be twinked by a friend.

If it was your primary character and therefore the one that has earnt all
his/her equipment. If not it is again open to sending in a twinked low level
character that can, in theory, cause havok.
I am not against twinking but in the "normal" game we are in no competition
with anyone else, only our own goals. On PvP it tips the balance to far in
favour of the twink.

Of course there is always the hope that anyone joining such a server would
be serious about keeping it RP and not just power game or play to ruin it
for others.
