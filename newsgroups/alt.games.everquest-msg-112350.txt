I have a friend who need a little help on this:
He gets kicked to desktop from the select char screen. Verant says that in
that situation he need to reboot the computer. He do so - but have to reboot
5-10 times before he are able to log in.
I recall I have heard about that problem before but forgot how to solve it,
and I would like to help him.
Anyone know a solution please?

Best Regards
Kim
