  Shipping usually replaces taxes for cost, with the end result
being comparing the bottom line price. Usually mail order is lower,
making the net cost lower if taxes aren't paid. Taxes + shipping
usually drives the price higher than discount store prices, which
is why most people don't order in state for items unless they
need them quicker or can't find them elsewhere. 

  I tend to reserve my internet purchases to items I can't easily 
find (which is often), or to items that are both significantly cheaper 
than locally found and the local suppliers do not provide a level 
of service worth considering a higher price for. But then I live in 
an area with lots of low price options for major consumer goods,
my mind set would probably be different if my local purchase options
were more limited.

  I don't have many problems with the concept of mail order / internet
sales taxes, just the proposed executions. Current laws on mail order
purchases base the taxes on the location of the buyer - totally counter
to the typical brick & mortar business which charges tax based on where
the business is located. Current proposals are to extend this buyer
location model to internet sales. All in the misguided interest of state 
governments to "keep their citizen's money local", internet based 
businesses would be required to invest non-trivial amounts of time 
and/or money on resources to keep tabs on state and local tax rates 
(including classifications based on type of goods) nationwide and then 
remit those collected taxes to the appropriate destinations. 

  But I suspect that is the intent all along, to drive up the operating
costs of mail order / internet businesses to the point where they are
no longer competitive, and thus please local business constituents
who are complaining to their representatives about the unfairness of
internet competition. No sympathy from me, too many businesses rely on
the "I'm the only game in town" syndrome to support high prices and
crappy service. To them the internet is a long needed wake up call.
