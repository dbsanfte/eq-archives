Well, it was just as mine before it changed, and the change *was* 
noticeable.

I don't think we're disagreeing at all, although I probably shouldn't 
have used the words "body odor" because they appear to imply poor 
hygiene. As you said, your diet has an large effect on how you smell, 
regardless of your cleanliness. The point I was trying to make is that a 
vegetarian diet will make your sweat much less pungent... even more so 
if you go fully vegan, but unfortunately giving up pizza is not really 
an option for me. :)
