This gives me SERIOUS flashbacks to the Ultima Online newsgroup from
years ago.

"PK'ing a serious problem."

"No it's not.  Plenty of people play with the PK'ing just fine.  It's
just a very vocal minority who keep complaining about it."

For me, of course, the recent patches are good.  They seem to have
fixed the problem I was having with EQ locking up periodically (the
one that Mr. Jekke was absolutely sure was my fault -- LOL).

Of course, game performance has dropped significantly.  But...it's
a worthwhile trade for me.  Those lock ups were killing me (pun
intended).
