Before I quit I always played in 3rd person view.  I used TAB or
mouse-click to target with no problem.  I used to have my camera
position quite high above the character and zoomed out to give a fairly
large field of view.

I used to play EQ in 1st person view until I played an Enchanter when
it became much more important to see all around me so that I could
watch for, and control, adds.  Even when I'm not playing a crowd
