And the fact that you are only supposed to be BANNED if you repeat the same offense.

I can't believe how some people could be so against Conquest.

They took a strenght of the mob and nullified it.  That is what a tactitian does (or
uses it against them).  If spells or abilities are used in such a way that if hurts
the player base, we deal with it and work around it.  If Verant were so mad about
what was going on with the forth Warden then let conguest die, as they were going
to, and turn the spawn off so they can't try again until the next patch.  Or tell
them you are banning them to look further into the situation.  Banning and Guild
disbandment were way too severe.

And yes I am very interested in the precedent that will be set by this.  I know this
will be the model for dealing with anything that looks shady by Verant, and I want
to be luckier than Conquest and have some idea of how Verant may retaliate for doing
things our way instead of theirs.

So you all can adequately flame me
No I don't think chain rezzing was an exploit.
Yes I do think pulling to the bridge was an exploit that gained them only the
slightest of advantage.
No I don't think the Clerics sitting under the bridge was an exploit.

Yes, I think creatures not summoning on the Z axis was a conding mistake that will
be fixed.
Yes, I think there is going to be a change about agro but not damaging, and still
being summoned.

IMHO I think the best resolution would be
Conquest give back all of the items
Verant give back the accounts
Warden 4 be turned off on all servers pending review of abilities and spells.

I think just that Conquest didn't spam their tactics or publicly, bash Verant very
brutally shows the dedication and respect they have for the game.  To ban two of the
members for a first time infraction is wrong.
