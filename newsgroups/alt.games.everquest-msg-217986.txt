Leather padding isn't hard to make.  Look it up.  Even if you *never*
work with leather -- other than to make leather padding -- you should
become extremely adept at making leather padding.  With a "failure"
rate (that destroys your supplies, no less!) well under 1%.

In real life, you wouldn't need to make 1,000 backpacks in order to
improve your skill at making leather padding.  Period.  End of story.

My underlying point is that you shouldn't try to invoke real life or
reality to defend EQ's tradeskill mechanics.  They're largely
arbitrary and just there to keep players from mastering tradeskills
too quickly.  The horrible failure rate on items like leather
padding -- that you supposedly can't improve unless you start making
other things -- is only there as a completely artificial game
mechanic to keep people from progressing in tradeskills too quickly.

Quit trying to invoke reality where it just plain doesn't apply.
