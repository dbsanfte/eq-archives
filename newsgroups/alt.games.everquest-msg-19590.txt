Specialization makes your spells cast cheaper and more reliably for a given 
discipline. You may specialize in all disciplines, but only one may exceed 
50 points. You will want that one to be Evocation.

Simply put a point into it, and then go find a green con and cast a level1 
burn on it over and over and over and over until your Evocation 
specialization goes above 50.

>What about putting all my points into meditate?

Don't even think about it. Meditate will go up on it's own. The only point you should ever spend on 
Meditate is the very first one.
