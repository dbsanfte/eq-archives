Nope, not fixed. You can let your pet sit with the other command for staying
in one place (/pet sit? not sure because have all of them hotkeyed a long
time ago :). It won't move after killing and it won't move after summoning.

I stick with the "/pet guard here" though. as soon as I summon it I smash my
"/pet guard here" button lots of times untill I get 1 or 2 messages of "As
you command master". It usually doesn't get further then half a foot from me
:)
