Not at all...  It was wrong and it was reprehensible.  Unfortuanatly,
it is part of the US history.

My point is, those who whine and cry about the Palestinians and think
that their terrorism is justified, those ones seem to forget that our
culture and standard of living today is the result of "oppressing" a
people, much in the same way that these bigots accuse Israel of
"oppressing" the Palestinians.
