Behemoth doesn't become targetable by killing spider, but rather by spiders
not going into his room.  We have our raid split into 2 groups, one on each
side.  Each group kills spiders for 9 minutes, then the enchanters take over
while everyone goes into the Behemoth room.  1 minute later MB becomes
targetable.  Someone mgb's a HoT, your clerics spam heals on the tank,
everyone beats MB up and 45 seconds later he is dead.  Everyone moves out of
the MB room and back into the hallway.  Have a monk aggro the flaging gnome
and pull him out into the hallway.  Once loot is quickly done and looted,
your enchanters ae mem blur the spiders and they resume their senseless
destruction.  It is important that anyone who gets spider aggro just dies.
No one should be killing spiders or healing people who are being attacked by
spiders.  Your raid hails the gnome and then AE xlocs out.  The event is
pretty simple if everyone listens and pays attention to when and what they
are supoosed to be doing, which is really the main factor in the success of
any raid.
