I noticed that Dwarfs and Barbarians are not even mentioned. Foolish me 
for going with a Dwarvan Warrior. This whole thing started when on my 
server, Xegony, there was alot of talk about 50+ Warriors having trouble 
finding high level groups, then lo-and-behold the same debate popped up 
here in the NG. So wanting to avoid future problems I decided to ask. 
So I figure the bottomline would be a Orge SK or Warrior. Thanks for all 
the info gentlemen. Anyone else have an opinon feel free to weight in 
with your thoughts.
