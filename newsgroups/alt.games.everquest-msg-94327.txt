Not defending Dean here, but I for one haven't been able to get to
either Scheduled Downtime or Network Status for weeks now.  It just
cycles endlessly back and forth bewteen "Connecting to <some IP
address>" and "Web site found, waiting for reply," with an occasional
redirection.  Are others getting there just fine?

Lately I've been relying on Caster's Realm to know if it's patch day.
