It's a moot question. You're KOS to the dwarves in Butcherblock and Kaladim so
you can't turn in those belts anyway.

You damage Indigo Brotherhood faction in Neriak when you hunt Crushbone orcs. My
gnecro decided it wasn't worth hurting faction in a semi-friendly town, so he
stayed in Steamfont until 14 hunting at the windmills and in Minotaur Valley.
The 5-skeleton spawn by the sunken gear will take you through level 13 easily.
Just watch out for the Mino Hero and the Kobold Missionary. This was before the
recent Steamfont revamp.

Nowadays everyone seems to go to Paludal to get through the teen levels. I'd
suggest you consider the Warrens instead. Better loot, you learn how to crawl a
dungeon and after a few hundred kobolds you'll add Paineel to the list of cities
you can visit, which is important because there are a couple of spells you can
buy in the SK guild that you'd have to research otherwise. You start out dubious
to the Erudin High Guard so you can bank there in the meantime, and you can sell
to the druid in Toxx Forest.
