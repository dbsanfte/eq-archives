Yes

 Out straight melee damage was probably close to equal, I had better
weapons (16/29 or 21/29 on my primary depending on save), she had the
two levels on me and was hitting from behind.

Ya know, that might well be what I saw given how proximity agro works
with undead. I might well have been 2nd on the hate list long before
the mob switched targets and it never switched due to the fact that I
was closer. I certainly never saw it when we where fighting regular
(not undead) mobs. I'd put that down to lack of procs but it might
well have been that undead agro works differently.

Since most (all nonsummoning?) mobs have proximity agro to some
degree, that might mean that hitting taunt as soon as it cycles is a
lot more useful than people think. If there's a caster at max spell
range higher up on the hate list than the warrior, he might well get a
significant advantage to hitting taunt even if the mob is still on
him. 

I can't think of any way to test that though.

Heh, you just shot down the one test I could think off that might
prove something.
