  Sometimes when I'm hunting something, I spin in circles and hit F8. Boom!
A wil-o-wisp, alright. Cast...3...2...1..here it comes. Sometimes it
happens. It was good of you to just go back to your spot.
  Another wil-o-wisp comes along, get it. That's fine. I couldn't give you
an honest answer on the agro part. Lots of things could have happened. I
wasn't there.
  They killed theirs and looted it, and turned to hit yours. They shouldn't
have done that unless you were like almost dead.
  You concidering telling them to "back off"...well, I think it was a good
idea that you didn't. That would have been kinda' jerkish of you too.
  They come up and do say something to you about it, that is just being
childish.
  You see a lot of things like this. I've been in the Oasis recently, and it
happens all the time. You just go on about your business. The only time I
ever really got mad about something like that was when I was in a group
sitting on Trainer hill in Crushbone, waiting to get a SBS for one of the
group members. I remember we actually just sat in the middle right in his
spawn point. Must have waited there for like ten minutes or so, I guess.
When he finally spawned, and we began fighting, a high level came up, nuked
it for 50%+ and looted it and left. We sent him tells and whatnot but he
just ignored us.
  I was very childish about it, and I think you are being childish now too.
It is just a wil-o-wisp, and it is just a game. Get over it.
