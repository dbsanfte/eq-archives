Yeah, cause petitions in the past have done a lot. They don't care
about a petition and in fact will go to great lengths to not do
something because of a petition since to do so would set a precedent
of customers getting up petitions constantly to change things they
don't like (they more or less said this on the board once, of course
it was Abashi so take with a grain of salt) People petitioned to
change the hybrid xp penalty for over 2 years, Verant changed it on
their own time when they got good and ready to do so after balancing
classes.

They are aware of the problem, there are several thousand posts on
their tech board about said problem, they work in releasing patches to
fix said problem, they are a business and of course its very important
to them that people be able to play the game and stay subscribed.
Sending verant a petition on this subject is like preaching to the
choir.

Yes, they have several times, possibly hundreds.

Evidently not.

So is/does Verant, its their baby.

Making a petition about an issue they are obviously trying to fix is
kind of ridiculous. You'd be better off making a petition to intel,
athalon, nvidia and geforce for some kind of hardware standardization
beyond what there is so this doesn't happen again.
