Create a mule, or maybe get it in the paineel SK guild. Much easier faction
for paineel, they are all heretics, and kobolds in warrens will do the job.
Should be nice and fast with a pet.
The way to buy a spell from a newbie is whatevere the spell costs up front,
and another 5p when he returns. That way he gets paid for his time, and he
makes more money if he does what you ask.
