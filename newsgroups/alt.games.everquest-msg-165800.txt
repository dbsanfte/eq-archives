Because giving power to goverment at all is like throwing gasoline on a
fire. Goverment and politicians have a thirst for power that can never be
quenched. You represent the worst in that you have an ideal and are willing
to do anything to the rest of us to force that ideal down our throats
whether we like it or not.

What you propose is using the govement ie men with guns with the full legal
right to use them , to go to someone point a gun in his face and say you
must fire that man and hire this one. You are willing to do this because you
believe it is 'unfair' that the employer gets to decide who to hire and how
much to pay.

There has been ample oppurtunity for all races to excell in america , we do
have wealthy blacks in this country which I know must just burn your ass.
Excellence knows no race , color , creed , sex , or age. The problem is that
mediocrity , uselessness , and worthlessness dosent either.
