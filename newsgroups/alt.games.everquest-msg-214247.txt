Nuke them, once. Look at the damage reported for the nuke, and the
percentage of damage done.

eg. if I nuke a MOB for 1100 and that takes him to 89%, then the MOB
has 1100/((100-89)/100) = 10000 HP. If it takes him to 50% then the
MOB has 1100/((100-50)/100) = 2200 HP.

As a very rough and ready measure, if you nuke something and the %
damage done by the nuke is more than the % of your mana used, you're
probably OK. (But remember to factor in mana used to re-root or snare
the MOB. Not to mention resists.)

Unfortunately there's no way to know the HP of the MOB without damaging
it, and if the MOB summons then you're probably toast at that point.
Allakhazam's has HP estimates for some MOBs, but they tend to be
raid-level.
