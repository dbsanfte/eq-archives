  Reasons looted in game lore, perhaps.  There aren't any quadroliths or
pyramids any closer the Qeynos Hills.

  If it's still useful at 50th level, I don't see the problem.

  Who said it was "research only"?  A spoiler site?  This isn't some huge
secret, you can buy the same spells from different guilds.  Sometimes I buy
my shadow knight spells from necromancer guilds.  As a druid I think I
bought Bind Affinity at a caster guild.  Why would anyone expect
"Levitation" to be any different?

  Gate to Cazic-Thule, lesser evac to the entrance.  It's still a useful
spell.

  Enstill can last considerably longer than Root.  It's better for root
parking, though perhaps not as good for emergency rooting.

  Lots of classes have "zoom" type of spells.  They are pretty useless, but
so what?  You have other spells that are useful.  Eye of Zomm is quite a
useful sight-related buff, if you want to look for one.

  This is pretty much a charm.  That's the domain of enchanters.

  Yep, clerics are pretty powerful, but their nukes in the "Retribution"
line are mana inefficient, they don't have a choice between magic/fire/cold
resist based nukes, and their nukes do less damage than wizard nukes (plus
they don't get lowered resistences vs. nukes after 30 like wizards do, or
spell crits, ect.)  Cleric roots also aren't as good.  The only thing a
cleric can really effectively "play wizard" against are undead.  Also,
you'll never meet a cleric who can evac or snare (except for that Clinging
Darkness clicktoy that Innoruuk clerics get... which is kind of junky,
between the slow cast time, the high resist rate and the short duration of
the snare.)  And clerics can't make themselves invisible without investing
in potions to do so, which is something that most casters eventually take
for granted, but it really is a significant inconvenience.

  Plus, at higher levels, you get some of the best spells and AA abilities
there are.

  If you don't like your class, choose another.  Wizards have been on the
receiving end of some very nice upgrades recently, and no really significant
nerfs.  What appealed to you about wizards when you created yours?
