Here's what Verant should do:

For each class, write up a description of how they see that class
functioning in the following situations:

1. Solo, low level (somewhere in the 20s or 30s).

2. Grouped, low level.

3. Solo, mid level (40s or low 50s)

4. Grouped, mid level.

5. Solo, high level (55+)

6. Grouped, high level (55+)

7. Raids, high level (55+)

8. Uber raids.

9. PoP solo

10. PoP groups

11. Pop raids.

Each description would describe a typical situation, and list the kind of
things that class is expected to do to contribute.  E.g., for "Raids, high
level", it might describe Monks as splitting spawns and pulling (if that is
something Verant wants them to do).
