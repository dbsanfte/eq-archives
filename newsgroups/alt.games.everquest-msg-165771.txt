The best advice I can give you is to look at the guild tags of people you
enjoy grouping with.  If you see the same tag on several of them, then
chances are you'll fit in with them.  Plus, if they know you, you'll have an
easier time in the app process.

How to group with the same people?  Exp in the same zone for awhile.  People
will start to remember your name, and you'll start to build a reputation. 
If you get a good reputation, people will seek you out for groups.

But if you want to apply to guild where nobody knows you, just pay attention
to how they act.  See who the ones are that help other guilds out.  Do they
assist other guilds that wipe out in Fear/Hate and need CR assistance?  Will
they help on epic mob ganks?  Do they let other people loot stuff on their
raid kills that's about to rot?

Ask around, but be sure to ask lots of people.  The high-level game is very
competitive, with lots of spawn racing and stuff.  Toes get stepped on. 
This is normal, but leads to lots of inter-guild psychodrama.  If people in
Guild X say that Guild Y is a bunch of camp-jumping killstealers, and
everyone else says that Guild Y is fairly honorable, then there was probably
a single incident involving those two guilds.  But if everyone says that
Guild Y is a bunch of camp-jumping killstealers, then they may bear a closer
look, and you may want to steer clear.

You are right to be suspicious.  It's one thing when someone you know says
"Hey, have you ever considered joining my guild?  I think you'd be a good
fit."  It's another when you get a tell out of the blue.

And consider this.  If this guild was a long-time established guild, how
come you've never heard of them?  Do a /who all "guildname" sometime, and
see how many people they have on.
