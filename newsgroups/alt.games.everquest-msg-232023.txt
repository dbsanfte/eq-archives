Why the hell are you coming on here bashing me? I started this post and was
simply discussing the prices on my server. I think you need to reread the
threads and direct your criticizm at someone who actually expressed an
opinion that you disagree with. I never even expressed any opinions on
pricing, simply stated that I sold them for 25pp so they would move.

See, that's the thing about usenet. You get people who just want to come on
here and throw out some ignorant, disrespectful remarks because they think
they are *cute*.
