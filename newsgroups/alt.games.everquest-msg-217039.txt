I can't figure it either because you don't get aggro healing a pet.

Sounds to me like you lost because the cleric was clueless - how'd
he let pets that enrage die?  Enrage gives you plenty of time to
slap a remedy on a pet then CH it.

Also, why was aggro jumping around you guys, rather than on the pets?
That bespeaks poor aggro management on the pet user's part.

I'm spoiled I think, because the cleric and druid I group with on a
regular basis have helped keep my pet alive while he offtanks (or is
MT sometimes - when the only other melee is an AM3/EQ ranger it makes
sense to allow him to be able to stand off and use his bow) since our
40's.  The addition of pet health bars in the new ui was a huge boon to 
them.
