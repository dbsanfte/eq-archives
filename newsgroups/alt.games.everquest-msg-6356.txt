I had the same problem with my 1994 IBM Aptiva. Pentium 90mhz, 1.3 gig., 48
ram. As soon as I spent $200 on memory and upgraded to 128 ram, I was able
to play the game and not have the pointer crawl across the screen. Images of
the game itself, NPC's and other players were always herky-jerky but they
smoothed out also. The only other upgrade that actually sped up the game was
a 56k modem. This helped reduce lag spikes and made the flow of information
during a battle remain constant and close to real time.
Once I hooked, I bought a modern computer and bit the bullet and got a T1
line and server so I could play without disconnects and other tripe.
The other big advantage to upgrading my old computer to 128 ram was that I
no longer was run down by newbie garden Mobs even when my character had SoW
on it. That was my biggest pet peeve when starting out a new character on
that computer.
Bigger, better, faster, now!  You can never go wrong by adding more memory.
