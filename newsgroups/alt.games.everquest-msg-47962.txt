Ah.  I misunderstood.

And I think you mean Protection of the Glade.

PotG is a nice spell, but hardly necessary for a raid.  HIGHLY useful,
but not necessary.  Same with the circle spells.  Very nice,
particularly because they're a group spell, but hardly a make or break
spell, especially because they only give 5 more cold/fire resist.

And druids are adequate healers at best.  Certainly no better than a
shaman.
