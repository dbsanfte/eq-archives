That is where I was until recently started a quest. Got from 20 to 26 fairly
quickly too. At 25 you could get a GOOD group and go to FM and kill the
Forest Giants as well. Decent experience and they drop Forest Loops. At 30 I
would move to The Over There though. Thats where alot of my guild is now.
