The most important thing to remember with the trade skills is that if
you enter into them with the goal of making a profit, you're going to
be sorely disappointed.

Yes, it is possible to make money with some of the skills, but it's
pretty rare. And the amount of money you make will almost certainly
not be more than you would have earned had you spent the time
adventuring instead.

Look at the trade skills as something to do besides bash-loot-repeat.
It adds some color and flavor, and that's really all.
