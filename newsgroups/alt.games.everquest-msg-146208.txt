Yes, more than half the mobs in the zone are dark blue to 60, in
fact a recent plan to kill nothing but cyans in an attempt to get
more kills per hour failed because (even when there were only
30 people in the zone, not like later with 143) there were simply
not enough cyans to pull.

The trick here is to move away from the traditional pull spots,
out into the zone.  With 143 people in zone all killing as fast as
they could, my party of four still had constant kills, and that was
with a druid quadding as part of the group.

On the down side, despite a couple hundred dead mobs, not
one shard dropped for me.  Got a yellow of exp, over 600pp,
and about 16 spell drops, though, so its sure better than
camping for Lord Bergurgle.

Is it just me, or shouldn't at least ONE part of the quest involve
undead?  Oh, I forgot, there are so few undead in the game
that that would turn this into a KS fest.  At least here there seem
to be unlimited opportunities.
