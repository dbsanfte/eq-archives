It is possible that if he was in the right place at the right time
he could sell it for 1000p I have sold stuff with inferior stats
for more.

How do you go about buying a car? At some point in the process you 
try to determine what a car is worth, armed with that knowledge you 
try to find a good deal, (or not if you are desperate).

If a car is determined to cost in the $10,000 to $15,000 price range
and you get one for $8,000 it does not mean the car is worth $8,000.
It means you got a good deal, and if you sold it the next day for
$12,000 you would not be ripping someone off.
