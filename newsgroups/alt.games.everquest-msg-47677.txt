Having a hit 40 with my Druid, I have decided I would like to create a new
character, firstly to give myself a rest from spellcasting and TP/Sow
requests, and secondly to allow a friend to catch up another 10 levels or so
, so that we can play together.
I have decided on a Human Monk. I am willing to spend around 2k to outfit
him once he hits L5, so I would appreciate any advice on what I should spend
the plat on, also any other advice from seasoned Monks would be appreciated.
I have been checking out the Casters and Alalazam etc, but any feedback
would be appreciated.
thanks in advance
