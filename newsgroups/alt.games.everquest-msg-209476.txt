Actually, I've been thinking on this one. I put together a lot of
groups as a cleric and generally look to fill the other five slots in
the following order:

Slower: Shaman then Enchanter, unless we expect to need CC or KEI,
then reverse the order. If neither is available, look for a level 65
Beastlord. Beastlord might be more desireable if we knew for a fact
that they already had the slow spell they needed. A bard can be used
in exigencies.

Tank: Warrior, Paladin, Shadowknight: With paladins I know to be
capable, they go before warrior. The problem is with unknown
quantities. I can keep a mediocre warrior standing in some place like
BoT, HoH, or Tactics. A mediocre paladin is going to fold like a cheap
card table.

DPS/Puller: Monk, Shadowknight, Bard, Ranger: Bards and rangers move
up ahead of Shadowknights in outdoor zones

Pure DPS: Rogue, Wizard, Mage, Ranger, Monk: This is highly dependent
on the individual and the zone.

DPS Utility: Bard, Necro, Beastlord, Druid: If no one in the first
five slots can snare, a snarer becomes essential in this slot.

That a class has to be "least desireable overall" is a foregone
conclusion. But, it's nice to see that SOE has gotten the classes
balanced enough that every one of them is sought out for something in
a group.
