i can see the pros and cons.
yeah, the zone could quickly lose its excitability (for lack of a better 
word)
going deeper into zone as you get more powerful is fun and pretty exciting.

now if you just want to solo, or cant find a group, or just want to be on a 
few minutes, this zone is ALWAYS available to you.  log in, run there, and 
bam, you got a whole zone to yourself that you can handle no matter what.

of course, with the solo nerf across the game, thats not so big of a deal 
anymore.
