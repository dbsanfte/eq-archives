Then who the hell would pay for the single plan? How would they ensure
'family' only used the Family Plan, and not friends, or even online
guilds. Same IP? Doesn't work for people with a dynamic IP address. Same
creditcard? Same billing address? Same last name? All of the above are
trivially circumvented by friends (even solely online guilds) who could
take advantage of it.

Who is to say what a 'family' is anyway, in terms of a Family Account
Plan. 2.4 kids may be the average, but should your 4 accounts come under
the same package as a mom/dad/son family, or conversely should a 5
person family get a package, or should they pay for 1 package and 1
separate account? Then they'd be demanding a 5 person Family Plan,
right?

Although a 'Nice Idea' <tm> in theory, when you look at putting it into
practical application, it's unfeasible. The above are just problem *I*
have come up with in 30 seconds, without thinking too hard about it.
Imagine 400,000 people worldwide, and trying to tie down a T&C for this
Family Plan which would maintain income levels and only be used by the
people it's targetted at (ie: You, and other families)

Basically, what it comes down to is this. It's $10 a month, down to
nearly $8 a month for the 6 month plan. Given you'd realistically need 4
up-to-date PCs to take full advantage of 4 accounts, that's a tiny tiny
% of your expendable income. I'm sure you could give an extreme
circumstance where saving $10/month (eg: 4 person plan = $30) while
running 4 up-to-date PCs would make the different between playing or
not, but not enough instances to make it worth VI's time from a business
sense
