Enchanters get archtype AA that allows them to extend buffs up to 30%.
They also get a class AA that extends buffs another 20% on top of that.
Add on Extended Enhancement for 15% more, or if they have their 8th shawl 
it adds on 20% more.  I think you can actually get items that extend buffs 
up to 30%, but I'm not entirely sure of that.

At the very least, all they have to do is grind out some XP to get 50% 
extension, which would put KEI's duration at 3:45.

With a standard Extended Enhancement 3 item and 50% from AA, you get to 
just over 4 hours.
