Deliberately ignored?  I said no such thing, thank you.   The only way you
could have never heard anyone talking about the improvements to UO is if
you've never been listening to anyone talk about UO at all.   (Or only have
been listening to a few bitter ex-players.)   I had a friend recently leave
EQ and go back to UO for a while.  So while I haven't been following what is
happening over there regularly, I heard quite a bit about the changes and
improvements there.

If, on the other hand, you're claiming that you've heard a lot about UO, yet
never heard anyone saying anyting positive about the changes there...  I
find that very hard to believe.

What I got annoyed at was everyone explaining it like I didn't understand
what you said.   I undestand what you said perfectly, I just think it's
either a meaningless claim or a ridiculous one.
