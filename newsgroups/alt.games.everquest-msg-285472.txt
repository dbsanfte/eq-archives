EQ is probably a much better game that it was before 2 years ago (POP-OOW 
era). I think the devs learned a lesson when the subscription base took a 
massive hit when WOW came out, and have been working since to make EQ more 
fun, but unfortunately for SOE I doubt that many will return, despite 
Blizzards recent attempts to drive people away with the unpopular changes in 
WOW patch 2.0, in particular the disabing of many UI mods which removed much 
of the games micromanagement.
