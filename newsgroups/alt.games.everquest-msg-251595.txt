As a general rule I nuke down to 70.  If the group is moving right along and
there's no sign of trouble I nuke down to 50.  If no one is getting hit, at
all, ever, I nuke down to 35.  I always remove damage shields on mobs and
usually send in my hammer as it costs almost no mana.
I am tolerant of *lazy* clerics who do nothing but heal, but the cleric in
question wasn't even good at healing.
