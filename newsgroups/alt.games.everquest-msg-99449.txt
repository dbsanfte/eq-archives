Hi,

Having seen this posted :

http://www.geocities.com/mathmagicexposed/

Which is reportedly the new xp needs per level for 30 to 49(end) via
ShowEq.

Assuming that this is correct (It could be totaly made up) it is still
almost as hard to get through 30-50.

The amout of xp required is exactly the same (126287640)
However by looking at the number of kills required to level we can see
that there is a slight easing of the requirements.

Looking at soloing even kills in a ZEM 75 zone the new curve takes just
under 2% less kills (1025 vs 1043)
Looking at soloing the lowest level dark blues in a ZEM 75 zone also
takes just under 2% less kills under the new system (1795 vs 1830)

So while the smoothing has made it easier (if these numbers are true) it
has not made it much easier.

If I had been comming out with numbers like 10 or 20% then I would be
worried, but less than 2% is negligable.

HTH,

Jim

PS the numbers sho post hell levels being between 12 and 17% harder than
previously with hell levels being between 69 and 76% easier.
