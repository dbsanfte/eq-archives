I would just like to be able to name my pet.  It wouldn't be as complicated
at naming a character because it wouldn't matter if your pet had the same
name as someone elses pet.  After all, the pet won't be on peoples friends
list or have a guild tag or anything like that.  It could work kind of like
your last name, only it would just show up when the pet was cast.  As a
Shaman I would love to name my pet Shadow or Fang or Killer.  What self
respecting Shaman would name her Spirit Wolf pet Jabeker or Jabober or
Goner?
