I'm pretty sure they made a conscious decision to alienate anyone with PCs 
not up to spec.  After all, CPU speed has stalled, memory advancements have 
stalled...even video technology has slowed down.  Sony is requiring a gaming 
PC to play its game.  That blows for anyone who can't afford the upgrade 
though.

It could be that EQ2's engine is quite efficient but does a hell of a lot 
more than WOWs.  I really have no idea.  WOW graphics aren't nearly as 
detailed, I don't think.
