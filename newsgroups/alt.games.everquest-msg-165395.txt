Turn the silks into silk swatches and go to the bazaar.  Get a trader
satchel and offer the swatches for 10pp each.  You'll have 400 pp
soon.  (At least on Xegony you would.)  Not sure about the going price
for spiderling silks or silk threads, but turning them into threads
will save you some bank space.  Check the bazaar for going rates on
your server.
