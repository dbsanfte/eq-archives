Or the grief it causes.

Someone left a plethora of corpses at the soulbinder in Shadow Haven
(Maybe not intentional..) a couple of weeks ago. The lag due to it made
banking worse than the Bazaar. If you accidentally looked over that way,
you got a slideshow until you finally manage to look down or turn away.

This is on a dual PIII/1G with 1G of RAM, Geforce4 MX400-64Mb, SCSI3
10000 rpm drives. Lag is not so much a problem on this machine, usually.

(What does it say about a game that needs such a strong machine just to
play decently?)
