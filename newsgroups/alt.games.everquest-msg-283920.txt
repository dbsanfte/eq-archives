The map X's show for group members in your group window.  If you watch 
how that behaves for corpses you'll know how the X's will work.

While the person is showing as dead in your group window you'll get an X 
on their corpse.  If they don't show as dead then you won't see anything 
unless they're in the zone.

That means if you zone out / in-again or they die in a zone you're not 
in, no X, if they die while you're grouped and in the zone, X on the corpse.
