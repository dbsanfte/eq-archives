Get them both. If youre like me and like to keep your defense up to scratch,
youll be using leach in just about every combat. You can lifedraw as well as
your leach being active, if things get tough.
Another thing... leach will give you the healing even after the monster is
dead. I often whack on a leach just before it dies, just to heal up.

btw... when you get to 16 make sure to take a trip to the overthere and get
banshee aura. Its a 9 point dot that lasts for ages. with low downtime you
can do 2 mobs with it. self only but still a great spell.
