    I'm aware of that. But there's a very specific definition of "exploit",
and I think you've misused it. It would be like me saying "the sky is red,
IMO".

    So it isn't an exploit, nor has it ever been (the mechanics you list
below date back to the original game).

    You earn that XP, as you still have to be able to kill the mob in
question. You can't PL someone on a mob they can't kill that way, as the
person won't be able to take down the mob to get the XP.

    And, indeed, when a level 10 is in the same group as a level 65, the
level 10 doesn't get XP.
