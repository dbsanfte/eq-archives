Kite with DoTs, not nukes.  As a druid though, you should have zero 
difficulty with getting enough range on a mob to cast any spell you have.  
You snare it first, the rest is easy.  As a shaman, I used to nuke kite a 
long time ago, now that is a lot more difficult, as shaman do not get 
snare (unless you are an Innoruuk worshipping Troll shaman).

Never tried this strategy, as without snare, a shaman rarely has time to 
sit to catch a tick.  You either root and rot, or you spend almost the 
entire time running.
