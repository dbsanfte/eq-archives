Well, you could be right and you could be wrong.  There are good
arguments for "NBG" and equally good arguments for true random
allocation.  However:

  Was the looting system agreed before the group started and when new
  members joined the group?

If the answer to this is "no", then either get it agreed ASAP or expect
friction.

Pickup group rule #1: ALWAYS agree the looting rules before anything
else.

Corollary: If you join a group with established looting rules, abide by
them or leave.
