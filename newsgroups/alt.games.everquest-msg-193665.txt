  Thanks to all for the well wishes.  I will be around till
Saturday or Sunday, but after that its a crapshoot.. Lenny's
talking about hooking up computers in the hotel rooms we'll be
staying at.  It will be nice to at least be able to access
usenet.  AGE is like the bar I hang out where all my friends
are.  I wish I could buy you all a drink!

    To the "why should I care" guy, well, no reason.  But there
are obviously others here that do.  My post was directed to
them.  Not everything in Usenet is meant for your information or
interest.  Feel free to ignore stuff that doesn't interest you! 
Really, it's fine.  I won't be offended if you ignore my
good-byes, and others may be less likely to plonk you.

  Oh, Graefaxe, we'll probably be somewhere around St. Louis. 
One thing I am insisting on is access to broadband IPS, so that
excludes about 2/3's of MO.  But we really don't have solid plans
yet.  We'll actually have enough money to shop around and get
what we want, rather than moving into someplace a quickly as
possible.  Course, with 4 cats in the mix, we aren't exactly
unconcerned with settling down.
 
   I am glad to hear that there are others in the group that are
somewhat close to where I am going.  I'm a big city girl, Lenny
is a county boy, and with us moving back to his turf, I'm having
visions of having to use out-houses and chop the heads off my own
chickens.  Nice to know, at least, that there will be a few
elements of civilization somewhat near to me!

Annie
