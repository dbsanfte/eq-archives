Given the "old timers" (not my term, by the way) inability to use words like
"hyperbole" and "irony" correctly, I feel pretty safe in assuming a word
like "missive" would be beyond their limited vocabularies.

By the way, clever sig.  Nothing like an outdated quote and "short bus"
reference to show you're funny.
