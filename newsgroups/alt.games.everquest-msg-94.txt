This trip isn't that hard for a good race, nerve wracking but not hard. In
fact I made the trip with my 18'th level Enchanter last night. Of course if
you're not a caster with invisibility thats another story.

Got on the raft at Oasis
Landed on TImerous Deep, cast Invis
Crossed the island to the other dock
Got on the Bloated Belly and rode it to The Overthere
Jumped off and swam to shore, taking care to stay on the safe side of the
wall
Recast invis and followed the shore to the zoneline and made my way to
Warslik Woods
Followed the zonewall to the gates of Cabilis
Recast Invis and *ran* through Cabilis to the Lake of Ill Omen
Lake of Ill Omen to FV
