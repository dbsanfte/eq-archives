LOL necro too slow? Holy shit.

Gee then I guess you better quit EQ then huh?

Look no one likes downtime.
Anyone out there like downtime?  *crickets chirping*
Hmm thought so. Hell I was the loudest one cheering when they finally
got rid of the spell book while medding thing, but that was more of an
interface
annoyance issue than a time issue.

But the fact is there are already ways to reduce downtime in the game.
Group, play with a Bard or chanter, play a Mage or Necro, etc.
The clarity line has level appropriate spells per level Breeze, C1, C2, KEI,
etc.
You don't 'need' KEI at level 1-40. KEI was making the lower levels too
easy.
Obviously it was the right change since you seem to be in the minority and
the developers fixed it. KEI was never meant to go on lower level
cahracters.

You think casters have bad solo downtime? Try a warrior, monk or rogue.
What about them? Should they have a 20 point regen spell that lasts 3 hours?

I find it amazing when people say they are bored with this game and continue
to
play it? What? Hello? There are so many things to do in this game its
incredible
to me that anyone can be bored with it. Beat yourself in the head with a
hammer much?

I do know one thing, if this game was easy I and whole lot of other people
would have quit a long time ago. I play this game because it is difficult.

There is a difference between making a game easy and making a game easy to
use/play.
