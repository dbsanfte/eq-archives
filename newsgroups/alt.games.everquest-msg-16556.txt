Youre telling me that you never ever wondered into an area you hadnt been to
before and got slaughtered because the mobs were way above you?
Also, people who say theres a lot of info on websites and stuff about the
different zones and how a newbie should do his research before going in are
missing the point of 'adventuring'.I dont want to read up on an area i havent
been to, id rather go in and discover it all for myself, sure i might get
killed and if after a few attempts, fail to retrieve my corpse un aided, i
might even 'shock horror!' ask for someone to cast one buff upon me. Now being
able to cast buffs(crap ones admittedly but its the thought :) i happily buff
strangers and to be honest dont give a crap whether they say 'please' or 'plz'
,donate, or bow or whatever. Im not doing it for the 'oh please, oh thank you'
shit, i know buffs, small ones make a big difference to a new charcters life.
And so i wonder off with a little less mana and a nice fuzzy warm feeling in my
stomach :P
