Worse. After fighting those Pharlog (sp?) Fiends in PC, I decided to
call it a night and set up shop in the bazaar - not realizing I was
still afflicted with the Creeping Crud. Came back after the game to
see I had died, returned to my bind point outside the WFP gates and
been beaten upon repeatedly by the several drowned citizens someone
had trained out there. I found myself standing atop a pile of my own
bodies with a drowned citizen smacking away at me. I was just barely
able to run to the zone to avoid yet another death.

I was also about a level and a half younger.  :(
