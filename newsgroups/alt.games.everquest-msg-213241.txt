Who cares if MGM or SOE loses a retail sale? MGM can't currently issue 
me a license with my media so that only I can play the CD they sell me. 
But if they could, they would... and the way the RIAA is going these 
days... that's where they are headed too.

Since your such a supporter of the system, I guess you'll be pleased 
when it happens; and you won't have any issues when your thumbprint is 
required to play your CDs. You won't be able to lend them to a friend, 
or give them away or ebay them when you outgrow them, etc etc, because 
these could all amount to MGM possibly losing a sale.
