Glad you got this fixed...there was a similar problem a while back
where the Skills window would get set to the bottom left hand corner of
the screen, and thus be basically completely invisible and unreachable.
 The drastic solution was to delete the UI file, the best one was to
just change those coordinates to accessible ones.

Game on,
