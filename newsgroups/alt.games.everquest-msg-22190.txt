The rogues must have been low on health then, cos Rampage is an AoE melee
attack in addition to the other normal melee attacks :)
Also , I don't know why you keep mentioning the 500 backstabs. You know when
a mob Ripostes is doesn't 'reflect' the damage of your attack back at you,
right? All it does is a parry plus a free attack from the mob. So unless the
mob melees for 500, it won't Riposte for that much. I wish it were so -
/disc Furious would be awesome ;p
