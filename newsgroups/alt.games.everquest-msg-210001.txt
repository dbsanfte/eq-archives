Rallos Zek was given the smack down last night and I am flagged for Earth,
Air and Water.

Thnx to Richard and Martin for their helpful hints. basically we just
persevered at it with the same tactics we knew would work and last night it
all came together.

We did employ the chanter pet tactic of using two dual wielding ogres from
the pig pens which provided a lot of additional DPS but we had a great
turnout. Whole guild was so pissed off with backflags and Vex Thal that they
all logged on to issue the smackdown order for Rallos.
