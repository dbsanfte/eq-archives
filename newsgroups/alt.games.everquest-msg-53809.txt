    People with poor gear don't want to be ridiculed by those with strong
gear, and possibly removed from groups / excluded from groups, based on that
inspection. I've caught myself looking at a paladin outfitted in bronze and
saying "Lord, not HIM. He'll be such a mana sponge...." Others are a lot
blunter and more cruel about it.

    People with exceptional gear don't want to be labelled as "know-nothing
twinks", which will happen if they make even ONE mistake while in a group.
Had one braincramp and didn't assist once? "Oh, that so-and-so is a useless
twink, he doesn't even /assist." They also don't want to field the
inevitable "what are the stats on that / can I have that / can u twink me
plz" tells that come after an inspect. Some feel they can't tell these
people to get lost, as who knows what damage to your reputation one person
can do?
