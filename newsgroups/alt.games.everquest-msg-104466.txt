Close, but not quite.  You do have to put the /pause first
if you combine it with something else, but the delay
actually occurs *after* the item it's paired with.

The way you have it, it'll try to /sit immediately after
the cast, *then* pause for 4.5 seconds.

Instead, use:

/stand
/g Casting my uperpowerful spell_01
/pause 45,/cast 1
/sit

I know it doesn't make any sense, but don't look at me,
I didn't code the game.
