A year ago, I thought WoW was going to be crap.  Over the last few months,
I've come to think otherwise.

The non-NDA beta has impressed me.  It will take some of the "mystery" out
of the game that would be there on release, but at least we'll have a better
idea of what we're getting when we plunk down the money for the box and pay
our first subscription fee.

WoW will no doubt have plenty of issues when it comes out, but one thing I
hope it provides is *serious* competition to EQ.  I don't think that SOE
takes its EQ subscribers completely for granted, but sometimes I think they
have a certain complacency from knowing that most subscribers aren't going
to another game.
