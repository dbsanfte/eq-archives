Well...since neither of the other posts answered your question on how to do
it, I will.  On the screen before the one where you type in your password,
there is an options button.  Click on it and one of the options you will
have is to check or un-check the models you want to see in the game.  Since
I currently only have 256MB, I only turn on the model of the character I'm
playing at that time.
