You are.

My $13/month plus 4 hours/week is worth less than your $13/month
plus 40 hours/week.  You're paying WAY more for EverQuest than I am.

Money is not the only way you "pay" for EverQuest.  Time is, too.

You can always earn more money.  You can never earn more time in
this life.  If a game makes you spend the only resource you can
never get back doing something mind numbingly boring like camping
a rare spawn...well, perhaps you should "spend" your time else-
where.

Of course, some people may genuinely and actively enjoying camping
rare spawns.  *shrug*  More power to 'em, I suppose.

: Im a power gamer, I can sit and play for 12 hours if i need and chose to.

We're all impressed now.

: If I need something from a camp, I sit there, stfu, and camp it.  I don't

Your true colors are really shining.

: Oh and FYI, I have a fulltime job.  I have a r/l partner.  I go on vacation
: 5-10 times a year (abroad).  I socialise with friends, go to bars, soccer
: games, shopping, the usual stuff.

We're all doubly impressed now!

But you forgot to brag about how much money you make and what a babe
your "r/l partner" is!  Don't forget to brag about how strong and
good looking you are next.  Maybe throw in, "My dad can beat up your
dad."

: From some moronic druid playing the game in easy mode, and expecting to just
: GET what he wants NOW?

I never asked for that, but it was a darned good try, trying to
put words in my mouth like that.

: And put up or shut up is talking about the camp, you either do it, or stfu
: about the item.

If I think SOE can implement rare items better than they currently
hour, I'm going to talk about it if I want to.  You'll just have to
suffer or killfile me.

: Im sorry you sympathise with pathetic noob druids who expect everything done
: for them.  Whats your main again?

Your maturity overwhelms me.
