I'm glad they finally did this. Starting a new char was always fun at
first, kill a few moss snakes, sit down to med, no spell book and all
that. THen get level 4 or 8 and have to stare at the spellbook for 30
levels.   Now can just sit and use the F9 to keep an eye out for a
baddie.

I started a mage on some server last night, maybe was Antonious Bayle,
jsut to see the new changes to Nek Forest (its VERY brutal now, btw).
Got to level 7 in one sitting (about 5 hours I guess), bad thing is,
I'm almost level 8, leveled so fast that I don't have enough money for
spells.  But I wasn't worried about losing my body with my lifetime
earnings of 50 silver and 200 copper.  When wanted to goto town just
attack a red and let it slam me.  Or gate :)  More time efficient to
die tho.  When gate takes 50% mana and dying takes no mana, but have
to remem the spells.

This was a godsend! I couldn't imagine a first timer starting EQ. I
would be completly lost and frustrated and surely would have given up.
CR at low levels is a pain, and even worse when don't know the world
or mechanics very well. Even small things like "run along zone wall",
"make macro with /loc and /doability 1 to sense heading when get loc"
that we take for granted, isn't in the manual.  Those 3 hour CR's in
Befallen at level 8 and roaming around north ro completly lost looking
for a foot sticking out of a dune are a thing of the past. whew.

It just keeps getting better. Hell, back when I started, first week of
release, we couldn't even rearrange spells in the spellbook, anyone
remember that?  Sucked!
