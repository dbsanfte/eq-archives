Do people post in this newsgroup about selling accounts? I may be
interested, but don't know how to go about doing so. If this is not the
place then where is the best place to sell? An online auction? If you have
any way of helping me out please reply to this or e-mail me at
joecooperjoec2athotmaildotcom. (You know the drill, find the at and dot and
change them to @ and .)
