ShowEQ sucks. It stinks that some people choose to cheat. I have
recently had the "pleasure" of helping a friend camp ragefire. We sit
there for days waiting for him and the uber guild using showEQ (or
something similar) zones in with a raid force about 3 seconds *before*
he pops. They should be banned!

Now hijacking thread. . 

Woah! Is it possible to run EQ from a linux box? I'm going to start
some more hardware upgrades (including a new hard drive) next 
week and I would *love* to ditch windoze altogether if I can. (Right
now I'm using a hacked Win98 OS (removed IE and a bunch of 
other MS crap) and litestep as a shell - it's as little windows as I
thought I could get by with. =P) The only thing that's stopped me from
installing linux before now is that I didn't think I could run EQ if I
did, and um, I'm an addict.  Do tell how you do it if you can. Can EQ
still be run using an emulator program or something?
