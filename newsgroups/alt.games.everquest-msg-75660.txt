Bzzzt.

charname_##.ini(where ## is our server number... 71 for Drinal for example) 
is friends, eqclient.ini is global settings... The file where these are 
located is the charname_##.opt files, which are binary Wanna-B-DB's. 
Someone was, I believe, putting together an editor for these files, but I 
have no idea what the status on that is.
