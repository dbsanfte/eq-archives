Which guild?  Since I play on TM, I'd kinda like to know if it's one of the
zerg/noob guilds or just a faction from a higher tier guild.

btw, I noticed the gimpness of sirens out in CS myself hunting up threads
for 6th shawl (combined 5th shawl... go failure!, then fail to make thread
for 6th), though they can still get nasty if they get a lucky set of spells
off.
