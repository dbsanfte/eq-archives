Yep. :-)
The fish rolls are the "banquet" size, but the muskie is the only known
example of the largest size. (I believe they are called "Feast" size or
something to that effect.) I have some fish rolls that I switch in and
out of the first slot for times when I'm going to be travelling,
auctioning, hunting greens for twinking, etc. and then switch in the
muskie for actual xp groups and raiding. Just have to remember to do it
well ahead of time, since the stat boosts don't kick in if you force
feed yourself, nor until the first time you "naturally" consume one. Or
so I was told, anyway. I got the info at eqtraders.com which I can't
access right now for some reason to verify the "feast" tag or whatever
it is.
