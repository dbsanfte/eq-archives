Um - no. The entire fight is puppeteered by the player, the character is
just the vehicle. Your character doesn't even fight back unless the player
reacts and hits auotoattack (or whatever).

Using assist in a group? Moving round behind the mob for a backstabb?
Casting inbetween mob swings? Snaring and using archery whilst backing
off?These are things that all require calling on the *players reflexes* and
have nothing to do with your characters abilities at all.

It is a double edgedsword though, my Ranger with his above master tracking
ability who can detect rats over the horizon, should be able to notice an
incoming Hill Giant 5 meters behind him, whereas I the player can easily
miss it if I am engrossed in fighting a mob in front. A grouped cleric who
jumps in to mellee often is also another example where the character can be
hindered by the player, or even a ranger using taunt when grouped with a
warrior.

It works both ways - you can play above and below the abilities of your
cahracter, depending on how clued up and coordinated you are.

Verant has no concrete lines, it seems to make it up on the fly. The biggest
factor being "have you pissed them off" in doing something. Kill a million
rats without taking a scratch because your in twinked plate armour does not
bother them. But try wiping out some uber mob they had reckoned practically
invincible, and showing up that they hadn't even coded the possibility that
it could be done, and you will soon have a reckoning.
