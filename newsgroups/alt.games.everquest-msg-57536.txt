Hmmm... Bizbee asked for a reason to switch off the ability to inspect, and I supplied one.
Since I have the "you've been inspected" message switched off, I can't give you detailed
statistics on how many people silently inspect.  I do know that it's a pain to have some jerk
assume that you walk around with nice stuff just so they can pick out what they want to buy.

On the other hand, at least then I know not to group with them.....
