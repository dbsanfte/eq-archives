Now why on earth would I do that ? It would take the fun out of my lunch
time. Besides, you would have to read all the other boring crap and find
someone new to abuse. Not too mention you would feel like crap, and I would
probably see your name up next on 48 Hours as the person who killed himself
cause he missed ol' GetsumJ.

 Sorry, I don't want the responsibility. I'm staying cause you like me so
friggin much :-)

But I tell ya what, if you say your sorry and beg forgiveness, I may stop
posting on top ?  Hell, that's a start !!!
