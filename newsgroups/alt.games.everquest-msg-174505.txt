On a very simple basis, you have:

Cultural  (race limit on who can make it, and who can wear it)
Enchanted Cultural (same, need chanter to enchant raw materials)
Imbued Cultural (race -and- religion limit for wearer, only race limit for
maker, need someone with spell for proper religion to imbue gem)
Enchanted Imbued Cultural (same as both 2 and 3 above)

Each more difficult and expensive to make than the last.  Enchanted Imbued in
particular demands help from at least one person, since there is no class that
can both enchant and imbue.

There are some gaping holes, though, where one race has no version of the
enchanted armors, and some religions have no imbued armors, or perhaps its just
that for some races, there are no armors which are imbued for some religions.

Half elves, in particular, are screwed by having no cultural armor they can make
at all, on the other hand they are blessed as the armors made by half the people
in the game will fit them.

Most people seem to think that Rallos Zek imbued heraldic armor is the best
player made (non quest) armor in the game, I don't know enough to comment about
this, but if you are creating a smith on purpose, making him capable of making
that particular armor would be a handy thing, and if you are making a warrior,
many who created warriors of any number of other religions have subsequently
pulled their hair out wishing they could change gods.
