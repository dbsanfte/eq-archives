You're right.  Although we can't med, and none of the clarity spells
actually help.  Basically, we use charm a lot and you either have to die or
just wait for time to pass.  And to be frank, I am not sure how in god's
name they picked int.

Lyrral's Logic:   Most of our songs, except for three lines, are based more
on the priest lines, snare, slow (debatedly could be applied to chanter),
dot's even dd's, plus movent increases, selo's haste etc, Mana regen, and
the mez/charming ability really are the only two lines that fall fully under
chanters.  I would have gone with the Wis being the main thing, but hey, who
am I but a player?

Interestingly enough, after I die, I actually consider how easy it is to get
back from my bind point before I accept a rez.  Sometimes it's nice to have
full mana for some of those spells that can be life saving and for when the
bard is the main cc'er.
