I (51 cleric) and my partner (50 pally) are looking for good places to
hunt with lots of dark blues and perhaps surprisingly are coming up
short.  We prefer to hunt as a duo if at all possible, as opposed to
joining a larger group.

We've found plenty of places with too many light blues and greens, and
also lots of places we really can't handle (most dungeons, for
example, since our crowd control is rather limited.  Yes, I know about
root-parking, thanks.  Limited, not non-existent.)

Ideally, any place we go would also be good when our friend (51 bard)
joins us, but the primary focus is on a place good for our duo.  We
have all the expansions.

Thanks in advance.
