If you're just going to have 2 people in the group, first thing is to
standard some spell lineups.  Next is to set up hot keys for the druid
specifically for your duo.  I duo'd a warrior and druid until mid
50's.  
I used the following Hot Keys: Heal, DS/buff/swap spell, Evac, Snare,
Root, Dot, Dot, DD

Hot Key 1: HEALING
/sit off
/pause 2, /target Paladin's Name
/pause2, /cast 1
/pause 10, /cast 1
/sit on

Hot Key 2: CAST 2
/sit off
/pause 2, /target Paladin's Name
/pause2, /cast 2
/pause 10, /cast 2
/sit on

Hot Key 4: SNARE
/sit off
/assist Paladin's Name
/pause 2, /Cast 4
/pause 10, /Cast 4
/sit on

Hot Key 6: DOT 1
/sit off
/assist Paladin's Name
/pause 2, /Cast 6
/pause 10, /Cast 6
/sit on

Occassionally the druid's sitting would get the druid aggro, so I
extended the delay before sitting and kept a STAND hot keyed with the
forage macro.
