just thought I'd add something here. The Kejekan do NOT like wolf form.
I was exploring, and was lost...not a huge deal because I can just gate and
run back. well, I had a druid friend with me, and she cast wolf form on us.
found a dock with some fishermen..and suddenly, a normally indifferent Kejekan
was attacking me. I wasn't thinking, and I killed him..and took a faction hit
=(
not too much, only to apprehensive, but be warned...
