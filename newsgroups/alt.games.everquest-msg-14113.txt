The Bard incident was one of my alt's, my primary is a warrior.
If this had happened to a pull my Bard was kiting then I'd definitely
appreciate it but whenever someone, mistakenly, steps into help with my
Bard's pulls they always Nuke and I lose the kill then they wonder why I
don't thank them, I seriously had a guy give me a tell of "Your welcome"
after such an incident when I went off to find another Scythe while cursing
at my Monitor, I'll let you guess how my reply went :ï¿½/
