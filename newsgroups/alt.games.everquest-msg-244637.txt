The Monk Mitigation Nerf isn't what killed monks for groups. LDoN did.
They still haven't recovered. Once their job of pulling could be done
by pretty much anyone on easy.. and hijacked by bards on hard, they
became a class in search of a purpose. There is nothing wrong with
monk mitigation as it stands, so long as they are considered the go to
guys when it comes to pulling. Hell.. why high-level enchanters could
single pull with slow still boggles my mind.

Either that or rape the abilities of other classes to pull effectively
while enhancing theirs.
