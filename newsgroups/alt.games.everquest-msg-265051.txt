I guess these are the make-a-group-member-blush or force-a-group-memmber-
to-kneel-before-you kind of abilities that were mentioned on the public
boards.  Are these "fluff' abilities characters get for free or do they
have to pass on other abilities to get them?

That's a bit surprising.  Hmm... so how down housing work?  Is it
something that everyone, after reaching a certain level, can afford?
Is it something everyone is expected to own or just a minority of the
server population?

>- Client rendering performance has increased.

Did that help with the performance problems on NVIDIA cards?
