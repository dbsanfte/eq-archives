That happens all the time... The guy who discovered that prions cause 
Alzheimer's and the one who found that ulcers are actually a form of 
infection had an awful time getting their theories accepted. But they did, 
eventually.

Bear in mind that there is a counterbalancing mechanism to the status quo in 
science: Everybody wants to be the next Galileo. Whereas it's very difficult 
to challenge the conventional wisdom, there is fame and Nobel prices waiting 
for those who do.

You got that right.

I don't like them very much either, but on the other hand, they are one of 
the few groups trying to dam the rising tide of irrationality, so I can't 
bring myself to be too hard on them. I wonder what their budget is like, 
compared to, say, the Psychic Network.

Well, he did grant him the completely undeserved title of "scientist"...
