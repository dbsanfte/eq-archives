When Sontalak is bugged, he won't move.  I'm not sure how you bug him, 
other than chain-casting harmony.  When he isn't bugged you can pull him 
out and kite him around.  When he's bugged I haven't figured out how to 
get him to move.  Once he's bugged, he will stay in that spot until he is 
killed or the server reboots.  Harmony wears off.  Harmony doesn't affect 
the mobs movement.
