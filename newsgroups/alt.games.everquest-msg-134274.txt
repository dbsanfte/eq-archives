I wouldn�t say it is completely useless, but it�s usefulness is fairly 
exaggerated. You might have a chance to block one or two primitive 
trojans and your netbios port in windows will be closed (which you can do 
anyway manually), but I agree a separate firewall box or a firewall 
router combination in conjunction with a private address space for your 
local network is much better. The FTP stacks have to be separated between 
firewall and computer for a good protection, and the adress space should 
be as well. Then add a basic port filtering system and you have a 
protection suitable for every home network. (Company wide firewalls 
definitely need content scanners as well integrated in the firewalls to 
prevent HTTP tunnels etc..., also they need medium and high security 
zones.)
