}As silly as this sounds - I've never seen a charm.  I've been playing EQ
}well before Charms came out.  My main is a 51 warrior (okay, I'm a more
}casual player who doesn't believe in PL'ing) and I routinely check in the
}bazaar for charms whenever I'm there.
}Am I too low to be seeing them as drops?  Have I just been very unlucky?
}Are charms always NoDrop?

At least, almost always no drop.  And almost always from somewhere in 
LoY, or a quest requiring drops from LoY.

}If not, where should I send my Warrior to find a charm that he can augment?

Try this, if you have PoP:

If you don't have PoP, you can spend a couple adventure points to buy a 
charm off the adventure merchants.
