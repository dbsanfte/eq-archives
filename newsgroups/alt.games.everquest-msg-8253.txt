I'm not a wizard, but I keep all my "standard" spells (the ones I
have memmed most of the time as my regular spells) on Page 1/2,
and in the order I like to mem them.

That way I can remem them quickly and easily after I die.

Then I have the "other" spells arranged by type on following pages
(Vs undead spells on page 9/10, buffs on page 13/14, cures
on page 3/4, etc.)

Finally, any spell that has become totally obsolete which I will
never have a use for anymore (i.e. spells for which I have gotten
an improved version as I have leveled up) I move to page 49/50 so
I can forget about them and they won't get in my way.

In case you didn't know, you can move spells around your spellbook
by right-clicking it, then right-clicking on the spot you'd like
to move it to (or swap it with if you right-click on another
scribed spell).

Also, you can flip to any page in your spellbook with "/book #",
where "#" is the page number you wish to see.  This works both
from outside the spellbook (it automatically opens the spellbook
and starts you meditating as well as flipping to that page),
or from within the spellbook if you're already looking at it/
meditating.  And "/book" without a number will take you back 
to whatever page you were last viewing if you're not already 
reading your book.  You can just type the command, or more handily,
you can make hotkeys labelled, for example, "buffs", "ports",
"nukes", etc. which are set up to flip you directly to the
appropriate pages.

You'll find that every few levels, you need to take the time to
sit down and do some more spellbook rearranging.
