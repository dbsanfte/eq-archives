This is the best page I've seen for non bait in the water fishing stuff.
Probelm is that even if you make a lure, you're going to lose it as soon as
you catch a fish? Sorry but a few copper per bait is far more economical
than making lures.

Hopefully VI will update the lures so you don't lose them..... one of these
days....
