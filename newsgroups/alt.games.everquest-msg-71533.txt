>You're assuming a master database for all of EQ. 

No, I am assuming a master database of User Accounts, based off of the
original CD-Key used to create the account.

EXACTLY. That is why all characters will be deleted when an account is
deleted. Through linked tables, whatever happens to the master user
account updates all individual server tables associated with that
account.

>Furthermore, I believe Bertoxx had a database problem which

>That's pretty difficult to explain in a one-database scenario.

"ONE" Master User/Account Datase, with links to individual server
databases explains what happened. Assuming the problem on Bertoxx was
a RAID failure requiring a backup tape to be used, thus explaining the
"roll-back".  

>That ignores the point, of course.  You can't magically "nuke the account
>which deletes the characters" without deleting the characters.

"Nuking" (deleting) an account would orphan any references to that
account on the world servers. With the proper tools in place account
removal would cause a cascade effect that would automatically remove
these orphaned references. It's a cause & effect. Deleting the account
deletes the characters.

There is nothing trivial about removing records from a complex
database. Especially one that is obviously distributed the way EQ's
is.

>Sure.  And yet the obvious question remains.  Your argument is that

I think we are arguing the same point from different angles.

Point taken.
