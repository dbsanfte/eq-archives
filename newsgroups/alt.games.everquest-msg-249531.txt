I don't know of any that can be. All the ones I've ever seen have an
activation code, once that code is used, it's worthless.

Well except for DAoC... for DAoC you have to have the codes to get back into
your account if you reinstall the game.

They most likely are aware of the problem and don't give a flip, and will
also probably tell him that there are no refunds on used games, store
policy. Unless they are a console only store... FFXI and EQ:OA are still
somewhat young, and the only games like that in that market that I'm aware
of, so they might not be clueful yet. Also I know that in one of the local
stores around here the corporate policy has an exclusion list of games they
won't take, including all the MMOG's. That doesn't stop the idiot worker
drones from giving some guy $5 credit and putting it on the shelf for $25.

Mind you, I think SoE should have a 'If you have the disks, you can sign up
for $10, +$5 for each expansion up to say, the last two, but there is no
free month' deal. Sure they'd have rampant piracy of the game. Who the hell
cares? If it's legit second hand, SoE is not out anything. If it's not,
whoop de doo... They are still paying to play and get started.
