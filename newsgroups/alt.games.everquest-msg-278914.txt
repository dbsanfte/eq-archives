Absolutely true, I'd never go so far as to say that HSP is equivalent to 
hardware, merely that the "cpu hit" is nomimal. I don't deny that if you 
threw some cache thrashing, over threaded, high priority task at it to 
bring the cpu to its knees you could disrupt it... but we're talking EQ.

After all real-time software runs at nearly the highest priority level, 
and device drivers for attached real-time devices do not get unloaded 
from RAM. It should be quite safe from EQ.

And for EQ at least its moot on a P4. A modern PC runs EQ with plenty of 
headroom... enough to 2-box comfortably even. And if you want even more 
you can turn some of the options down or use EQplayNice. I.e. you 
*aren't* doing something "so processor intensives that it can affect the 
timing of real-time software..."
