I think you were fine in bailing.  It was bizarre.  The leader wasn't
leading.  You attempted to pull, but it wasn't working.  You announced that
things had to change or you were leaving.  No one suggested change, so you
left.

I have no problem with this action, and probably would've left with you.

I hate it when I join a group and the leader refuses to lead.  The only
different choice you might have made would have to been to /tell <leader>
are you going to fix this, or would you like me to lead the group?

If /makeleader Annie happened - Then you could have simply said "you there,
ranger!  Pull!" and that would be that.    Nonetheless, I think your
response to the situation was perfectly fine.

(Now, what kinda stupid-ass tank would let his/her cleric pull?!?  Not me!
I'd be happy to have you sit there, med, and throw the occasional heal my
way...)
