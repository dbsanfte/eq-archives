hi guys if its me again asking for more advice

im now a lv 13 paladin called Dareydiel (finally got the name right) in
Brell Serilis server and all she sees is east commons all i do is kill orcs
at the camps and thats getting really boring i tried going to oasis of marr
but some stupidly powerful sand giant killed me and ghee the trek to find my
body was a major chore

i was wondering it seems really hard to solo and i prefer to solo as i
prefer to play at a slower pace when i was grouping to fight orcs our party
kept on dying as they just pulled non stop with no thought as to their
health levels. so i was wondering wheres a good place to solo for me?

also with all my money i finally got full banded and i bought a blacken
alloy 2 handed bastarded sword that does 22 damage but i find that i have my
damage that i deal range from 1 to 28 i find this strange as my old sword a
runic blade that has 18 damage did 29 and did that constantly it would
sometimes deal out 14 but usually 29 i was wondering shouldnt my new sword
do more damage? also im not twinked this is my first ever character and i
bought the bastarded sword for 120 plat from selling lots of deathfist
belts. was wondering is that a good price or i got ripped off as he was
trying to sell it to me for 200 but i told him that it was out of the
question for a newbie to make that much.

also i was given a spear called messenger of the queen that does 20 damage
with some small stat bonuses i was wonder is that a better weapon than going
2 handed as i only really want to level up one skill. piercing weapons seem
really limited.

also i like to travel and sight see and everquest is like a virtual holiday
for me is there great places to see like land marks. eg awesome looking
elven cities, great natural structures i was looking at the map and saw the
fironia vie island does it have that awesome statue of some female elf that
be a sight to see. i only special thing i saw was a stone circle like stone
hendge in west commons but i got slayed by some dark elf that said he will
strike me down in the name of the dead and so i never returned ( by the way
who was that).

anyway im talking too much

Thanks
best Regards THACH Nguyen
