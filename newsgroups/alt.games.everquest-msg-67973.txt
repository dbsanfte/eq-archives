I don't care for it myself, which is why I have it lock to one
resolution.  The small med screen is a bit goofy looking, but eh.

Hexdump just posted a pretty good work around to this.

The point of staring at the spell book is that your are suppose to be
so immersed in meditating that you are oblivious to your surroundings.
It's a disadvantage of being a newbie.  As your character becomes more
powerful and more adept, he is able to meditate while simply at rest.
The whole point of having a level based characters is that you are
suppose to become more powerful as you level.  The spell book is a
disadvantage for low level characters as that they can't be aware of
their surrounds while medding.  You get the advantage of being able to
watch your ass once you get 35.

There are work arounds for this, as Hexdump was so kind to post.

But there is an pretty good role play reason for having your character
blind while medding.  In all fairness, for the reasons they are
giving, they should just make the screen go dark while you're medding.

Now it sounds to me like the only reason book medding ruins your role
playing experience is that you just don't like it and refuse to accept
it.  I'm not saying this isn't valid, but it just sounds like a bit
too much stress to put yourself through.

Trust me, I'd have LOVED to have an intermission for SAVING PRIVATE
RYAN.  After the DANCES WITH WOLVES debacle, you think I'd learn to
plan my fluids a bit more carefully.  ;-)
