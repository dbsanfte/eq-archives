When you install the mouse software, it loads an executable name EM_EXEC.exe
or something like that.  It interferes with some games that have a 1st
person view.  I found a small tech note on this on Logitechs site when I
couldn't get it to work with Unreal Tournament and Giants:Citizen Kabuto.
This loads EVERY time you launch windows.  Press ctrl+alt+del before playing
and turn off this program manually.

I have optical logitech too, and though I have not had to do this to restore
scrolling in EQ personally, it might at least be something to try.

Good luck,
SEAN...
