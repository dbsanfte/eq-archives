Running through Qeynos Hills on my way to SF Glade for some Fletching
supplies (used up my considerable supply of arrows completing the Wakizashi
quest in SB Mntns) I hit track, as always, in the hope I might see Pyzjn but
what I see up is Hadden....Hmmm.
Never seen him on Bristlebane before, no idea what level he is but I know
what he can drop...he's red to a 20 but I've been doing high 20 mobs in SB
so I know, assuming he doesn't cast...I can take him...Hmmmm...I buy my
fletching supplies and log on Shaman.

Due to the quiet nature of FV I have needed to keep my bot characters
somewhere close to my Main...they are both just in 20, my ranger is about to
ding 21 but only one other account has access to PoK so Shaman it is...this
could be tight without cleric. I check the zone see if I have any
competition for the spawn...nope, there are 4 ppl and 2 of them are me, the
other 2 are under 10th...He's mine, for the moment. There is a short dilemma
as I wonder if this is really a good idea and being a Ranger aren't I meant
to be...Nah...no ones around I'm sure I can kill some gnolls and make it up
to the people I am about to offend ;ï¿½)

First attempt goes wrong...very wrong...I aggro Rephas and Ax Broadsmith as
well...Rephas, the scum sucking Enchanter that he is...Charms me. I just
stand there, can't camp, quit or anything. It's at this point my Shaman
arrives and Rephas decides that his newly charmed pet and my Shaman should
have a fight....B*st*rd...so I am running my alt from my main. Shaman
doesn't have root mem'd and Ranger is SoW'd, I kite myself as far away from
where I think anyone else will be while doing an End Task on
Ranger...Finally charm wears off and Ranger goes LD, good job the zone was
empty or I could have been murdering PC's....how's that for a reputation
killer?
I log back and do it again, this time avoiding Rephas' wrath and snaring Ax
to lose him I take down Hadden. I won't bore you with the full details but I
basically have learnt (while killing panda cubs in SB) that to take down
reds all you need to do is be able to heal well enough to keep up with their
Dam output then Bow Kite when mana is low, while the healer(s) med and bring
them back when mana is full, rinse-repeat.

I am now the proud owner of a Fishbone Earing...Only do I want to keep it?
At 20th level there aren't many places I will need it, that I can think of.
At 22nd I get EB as a spell and it's worth between 1.5 and 2k which could
buy me some better armour to replace my Trueshot pieces.
So..considering I have no EB item on any of my characters on Bristlebane, I
can't really see a use other than a plat source atm...On the other hand, I
looted this item...it's a rare drop, I kinda like the trophy.
