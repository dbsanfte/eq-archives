Yeah, we've got to wipe out the Al Qaeda and anyone else who disagrees
with our view, so it becomes universal.

No, you claimed that there is a single human society. But apparently
some of them were on holiday when the rest ganged up on Germany.

That may not go over well with the Muslims and Hindus, since the
Christian majority* believe that if you're not Christian you're going
to hell.

But don't worry - Islam is gaining fast, so maybe theirs will be the
majority soon. How do you think the women in your family will like
wearing a burqa? They'll be evil if they don't, after all.

As far as determining who is right? We can't. That doesn't mean we
shouldn't crush them, but let us at least have the good grace to admit
we're crushing them because they represent a threat, not because our
morality is inherently better than theirs.

What do you think "subjective" means?
