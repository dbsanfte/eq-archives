What most 40-something players do not seem to realize is that if a
group's MT is taking a <lot> of damage there are <three> ways to
minimize down-time.  Besides the classic and obvious Cleric with
Complete Heal, and the less popular but still reasonably well-known
Shaman to slow the mobs, there is the WizardGoBoomMakeMobFallDown(tm)
technique.  This latter method works especially well when you are
using a Druid for healing, and actually can make a Paladin a viable
healer in a group that includes a Ranger (Druid/Ranger snare means
the Wiz can nuke earlier to get the mob turned to run so the melees
can beat it down without taking further damage).  I don't know how
well this works at other level ranges, but the mobs I was fighting
in my 40s did pretty serious damage to all but the most ridiculously
twinked tankers (and even they knew they'd been in a fight) and a
Wizard in the group was an excellent down-time reducer.
