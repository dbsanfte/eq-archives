The flowing thought 1 effect is worn so usable from level 1. At the low
levels just think of it as a flowing thought only item and forget about the
stats as you won't be getting access to them for quite some time. The item
then grows in power with you as you level so at level 51 it is <still> a
nifty item. Excellent value.

I really like recommended level items, especially when you compare it to
"required level" equivelents. You can twink a new character with items that
get stronger as your character get's higher in level. My 42 bard has quite a
few "recommended 51 - 60" items which are decent right now. When I am level
55 they will still be decent for the level of the character - very good
value for plat that way and it increases my motivation and feeling of reward
for leveling.
