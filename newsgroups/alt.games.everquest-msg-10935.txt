The big difference is, in case you missed it, that no one in EC buys
anything for real world money. It's all bought with money that was,
presumably, earned in the game. THAT's the difference. If I was able to
go and spend $50 to buy one of my characters a full suit of Ry'Gorr,
what's the point of even trying to play the game to get it?
Additionally, someone is making a REAL LIFE profit off of something that
they CLEARLY do not own. I'm sorry, but no matter what anyone says, you
do not own the little pixels on the screen, and you do not own the
individual files on the VI servers that make up that set of armor. And
for you goddamn EULA people, you still have to agree to the license to
transfer the equipment, so shut up! Ahhh...I feel much better now!
