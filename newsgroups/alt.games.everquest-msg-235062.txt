Certainly, but would it be worth the hassle to all the other people
that suddenly have to live in a barter economy? Personally, I'd answer
no. I don't really see a huge impact on item prices even now. Prices
spiked in the bazaar with all the rumors of Plat cheats but most items
are already back down to about where they were before. I'm still not
sure whether the inflation a month ago was caused by rumors or plat
dupes <shrug>.
