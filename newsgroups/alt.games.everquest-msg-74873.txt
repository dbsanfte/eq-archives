If you only signed up for one month, then you don't have to do
anything. At the end of that month the account will be closed. If you
want to reopen you just login and go through the ACCOUNT button, and
sign up for more time.

If you have only played for two days, you might want to give it
another try. 2 days is not really enough time to evaluate any MMRPG.
The first month is free anyway, so you have nothing to lose.

Cheers
