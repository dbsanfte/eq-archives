First,
You missed the point. There is no server that was set up as a guild race 
to beat Quarm with a cash prize for the winner, but if there was that 
would be ok.

However, that is nothing like the buying & selling of characters, 
character equipment, and pp in the existing server pool. That's pretty weak.

Second,
If such a server did exist, Yantis would be there, not racing for Quarm, 
but farming pp, and selling it to the other contestants. That's pretty 
weak too. And he wouldn't have to 'win the race' first as you suggest.

Don't be so sure.

Stopping Yantis in Eq is very difficult because of some very stupid 
design choices, however even EQ1 could be modified to make it not worth 
his while.

Designing a game that isn't nearly as vulnerable in the first place is 
far less difficult.
