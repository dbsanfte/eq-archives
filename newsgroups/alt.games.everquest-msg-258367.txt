Nice for recovering from raid wipes. Particularly if no clerics or
necros survived.

Could be interesting. At the very least gating back to bind to sell
then gate back to the group to continue fighting. Or place a secondary
bind point at a mob you are camping, and pop in every so often, but
still be able to gate out quickly if it isn't up.

>Shield Block

Something that has been asked for by some for a while. If it's any
good, might be a reason to see warriors use shields again.

Automatic life tap proc. Nice. (combine it with all the other procs
you might have on your weapons.)

>Spiritual Channeling

Sometimes things just go so bad so fast you need that mana NOW. Cast a
HoT on yourself and go to town. =)

>Teleport Bind

Again something some have been asking for. On servers where casters
can bind anywhere, it might be used as a way (with Secondary Recall)
to move lots of people into a raid area. (Would it bypass keying
restrictions, I wonder?)

Solo, just a way to delay death, as the mob smacks your helpless body
for longer than usual.
With CHeal, essentially just another 100HP. As a Tank you can never
have too many hit points.


Plus lots of bones thrown to the 'Zerkers.

Not too bad if you ask me. I think I just might get this OoW thing
afterall. (Much better than the GoD aa's)
