I bug reported a scion about 2 weeks after Luclin
came out, because I'd accidently Canceled Magic
on one with my Mrylo gloves (was aiming at
Cordelia Minister).  Since the scion was perma-rooted,
she didn't come after me.

However, a nice druid stopping by threw a SoW
on me, which apparantly got him on the scion's
aggro list, too...because when he got close enough
to the scion to ask for a stone, he got seriously
smacked around.

Be nice to the scions...
