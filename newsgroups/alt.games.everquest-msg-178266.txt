Well, looks like there is no end to my EQ-related woes... >:-[

Since I don't want to risk getting Hanrahan into a fight and then going 
LD, I'm taking stock of my old low-level alts, see where they are and 
what their equipment is. Strangely enough, one of them *always* crashes 
EQ upon entering the world. I've deleted his UI file and his .ini file (
I guess I'll try the log next), but still crashes EQ to desktop every 
single time.

Has this happened to anybody else?
