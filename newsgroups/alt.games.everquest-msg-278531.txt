I just got the computer back from my tech. The Hard Drive needed to be
reformatted to fix performance problems. What he did was to transfer
the EQ game on to his server and then partitioned the HD before
putting th EQ game back on the computer. When wee try to load the game
now we get the message :
Login rejected. The clients version does not match the servers. Please
re-run the patcher...." 

First of all I have no clue what that means. 2nd question I have is if
we reinstalled from the original CD would Ryan have to start all over
again or are his files for as far as he got on line? Or were they on
the HD?  Does he have to start from scratch again? He has spent a LOT
of time on EQ and has 3 advanced characters. I am not qualified enough
to get this going for him so all your help is appreciated. I looked at
some of the forums but the language is way too technical for me and
him. 

How do I get him back to where he was so he can continue from where he
left off?

Thanks all.

Mick
