Let me guess, you had the level 51 SK tanking instead of the level 59
ranger right?

The ranger would have made a better tank.  AC maybe king, level is
however, god.

Nevertheless, I stand by my statement.  You have enough tanking power
in that group to trivially handle 3 spiders at once without ever
needing anything past shaman heal.  The two rogues alone will make
sure the spiders die real fast.

Irrelavent.
The hopping stone from Tormax to ToVN clearing is about 3 weeks.
Yelinak is SUPPOSE to give guild "issues".  They buffed him remember?
He has about double what he normally had in terms of hitpoints.

Sontalak is always a messy fight.
There's never a "clean" kill of Sontalak and his drops absolutely
suck.  Aside for the ST key talisman, you can expect to load up on a
lot of reinforced and worked dragonbone shit.  Very rarely do you find
a matchless or peerless.
