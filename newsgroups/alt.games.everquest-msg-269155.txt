As I said, though, problem is that you're then acceding to the idea that
"twinks rule, peons drool", with the expectation that twinks move in,
non-twinks must move out and find some other place to gain XP.

With you wandering off like that, the result is that the twink gets the
stuff while you not only get no more XP for the area you were just hunting,
you also get no XP for the, say, average half hour you spend trying to find
another spot that some other twinks or PLs haven't laid claim to.

Not really.

The logical conclusion from always backing down is that if there's a number
of twinks about, you, the non-twink, don't deserve any XP.  And you don't
get any, either, if you're not willing to stand your ground.
