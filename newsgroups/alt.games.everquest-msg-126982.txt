Unless Im mistaken, haven't they done somthing very similar when they ran a
cross server competition ?

This is second hand so I cant verify the veracity, however the guy who told
me had no reason to lie. Apparently what happened was that there was a giant
PvP tournament for Shamans on all servers, and the characters that won on
each server duked it out on one specific server ( may have been Test for all
I know ). What they ( the GM's ) did was make a copy of each individual
servers winner on the server where the final contest was to take place.

Like I said though, I cant be certain about this as I didnt witness it
myself ( happened before I started EQ ).
