I've been playin EQ since June of 2000. I started a necro, got him to 56, and
then stopped playing him because I could never get groups and none of the decent
guilds on my server (Veeshan) wanted me. I looked around at that time (October
2001) and decided the best class to play would be an enchanter, they seemed to
have no problems getting groups and best of all they were very desired by the
high end guilds. So, I made my enchanter.

I've been in the same guild for over a year and a half, was quite content there,
we were not high end (elemental) but I had a group of friends I knew well and we
would all go exp group from time to time and hang out. Recently the leaders of
the guild stopped playing EQ, and consequently, things went downhill. The new
leader did not have much time to put into the guild, so consequently the guild
fell apart. I now find myself guildless, and so I looked around at the elemental
guilds to see if they needed enchanters.

I now find enchanters are the lowest desired class (in guilds) on Veeshan. This
is because everyone and their grandma has an enchanter as an alt or whatever.
Hence, the only way I can get in a decent guild now is if I have lvl 65, 60 AAs
and at minimum flagged for HoH, BoT, and CoD. Right now I am level 64 with 23
AAs, and am not flagged for anything except PoV. I cannot get those flags unless
I am in a guild, and as I said before most guilds are not doing those flags
anymore and do not want to backflag an undesirable class like mine. I do not
like the prospect of joining a guild just to get those flags and then ditching
them, so that is out.

So, what do I do? There don't seem to be many pickup raids for these flags, and
all my experiences in pickup raids have been disasterous. I find necros are now
a lot more desirable than they were 2 years ago, so maybe I should table my
enchanter and go back to my necro? Problem is, it's still hard for necros to get
groups, and I don't like soloing much, it's boring because you have nobody to
talk to.

Has anyone been in this same fix as me and have some suggestions? I appreciate
any advice. Thanks.
