Okay, this is happening for the second time on more than one computer, but 
it still might be some kinda weirdness with my linux box/router.

The login server sometimes takes a while to respond, eventually sending its 
reply back after the client times out (tells me it didn't respond).  I can 
run a tcpdump on the linux box and I can see that the login server does 
eventually send a reply back on the original port that the client made the 
request from, but then my computer sends back a port can't be reached 
packet.

Anybody else seeing similar behavior?
