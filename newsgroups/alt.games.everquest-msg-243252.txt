Yeah, no doubt.

The sad thing is I have considered buying IGE plat. Yes, it's fucked up, 
but if everyone else gets to benefit, I should as well. 10k is something I 
see *maybe* once a month- $15 for it seems a good deal to me, and a single 
10k chunk can upgrade any one of half my slots.

Yes, me too.
