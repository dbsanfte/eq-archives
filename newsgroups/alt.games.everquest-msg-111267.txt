    That's a variation on what we do. Only instead of keeping a wall clear,
we position so everyone gets knocked back towards the throne. Plenty of room
if everyone is shrunk, and no worries about adds.

    Depends on what their guild makeup is like. If they're caster-heavy they
should be able to clear that fast. It can also depend on whether their main
tank is beefy enough to stay in after Defensive wears off/whether IV is dual
wielding or not.

    If they've done proper rampage management, they should be OK there
(given the healing to keep the rampage tanks alive).
