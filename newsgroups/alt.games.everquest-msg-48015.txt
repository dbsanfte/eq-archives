I don't think that would be a factor, your will do more damage with the
higher damage weapon, assuming no damage bonuses, on both the attacks.  Yes,
double attack will go off less frequently in time, but doing more damage
each time, overall, the better ratio weapon would do more damage on double
attacks.  Please, understand, I am not arguing that a high damage slow
weapon is better in general, the faster weapon, is better for damage output,
as the damage bonuses added more than make up for the difference in damage
of the weapons generally.
