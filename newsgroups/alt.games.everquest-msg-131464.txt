Thats what made me question whether this was happening to others;
I would have ascribed having all models turned -off- to a computer
glitch on my end, but all models -on- didn't seem like a random
noise type effect.

Not to my knowledge, but if its not a known glitch this falls under
the Occam's Razor solution set; since it is possible to boot up EQ
and change the options without a password this would be possible
with relative ease.  What would prompt the person who came
over to feed my cats while I was on vacation to do this is unknown,
but motives aside this seems like an elegant solution.
