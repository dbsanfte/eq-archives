They never have been very good money, all the idiots just get sucked in by
the "OMG he drops a lot of plats" factor, there's a bazillion better ways to
make money out there.  Such as crystal caverns geonids, or just hunting
normally to get levels so you can hunt in places like Chardok, Sebilis and
Karnors for the rareish drops and make 4k at a shot selling them.
