Treeweave goes for a pittance and is a decent item for beastlords until you
save up for Phase Spider Carapace or something similar.  I'd go for a lot of
Acrylia pieces, maybe some Nathsar gear if you can find it cheap, and
HP/mana jewelry.

The gear you'll want really depends on how you play the character.  For
example, if you're going to be soloing, hence doing a lot of pet healing,
you might want a bigger mana pool so concentrate more on wisdom and mana
items.  If you're going to group, you can concentrate more on melee, so you
would probably want better weapons and a haste item.  I mostly go the melee
route on my BL, so I got Silver Chitin Handwraps, a Sebilite Croaking Dirk
(nice ratio and pretty fast) in primary hand, and a Stave of Shielding
(excellent ratio for the plat) for offhand.  His wisdom is nothing to sneeze
at, but I concentrated on it after AC and HP.  You say you are going to both
group and solo, well, I'm not sure what balance to strike, but if you can
find stuff with decent wisdom and mana without sacrificing ac, that would be
my suggestion. :-)
