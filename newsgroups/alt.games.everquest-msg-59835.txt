I have two friends who are both in the same rough dilemna;
both discovered quad kiting in their 50s, and now both
are looking for more potential targets.

In both cases, they worked out their techniques in Cobalt
Scar on Wyverns.

The Druid is still getting exp on them, but would like
more variety, and some choices that aren't quite so
often already taken... if there's any sort of crowd in
CS, then finding four birds alive at one time is a chore,
if not an impossibility.

The Wizard, on the other hand, at 59 is having trouble
finding -any- sort of exp prey she can quad kite, anywhere.
Currently she is taking out Othmir, but frankly finds
slaughtering their cute little hides a little repulsive.  Would
prefer something more clearly evil, or at least not cuddly,
to kill.

Any ideas?
