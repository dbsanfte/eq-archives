Probably the best time to have played it. All the idiots had moved on. I
had the demo version but about when I started to play again someone worked
out to much info was stored outside fo the secure side. Could play games
with friends on a LAN though - I was lucky to have that sort of access

Yes, I heard about it from friends in the industry - they got the full
game first but had several copies of the demo sent to them from marketing
people to pass around the office, their friends and the quake clan. It was
unplayable for most of the time I wanted to do so unless you could do it
privately but you probably got it at a good time if you went in late.
However 'yeth masters' they didnt really seem to do a good job of
visiblity.
