   Very very true.  CoH is pretty enough, but one realizes that one is
going to have to deal with a lot of repetitive scenery very early on. 
Everquest, OTOH, really did feel like a world to me (as long as I ignored
things like zone lines).  I hope that CoH can work on improving this as
time goes on, but they got alot of ground to cover to begin to catch up to
EQ.

    To me, CoH has one huge advantage over EQ, and this is it.  There's
been talk on the EQ newsgroup about exactly what a "casual gamer" is, and I
think that this might be one of the acid tests.  Is a particular player
willing and able to sink large chunks of time into camping a particular mob
for a particular drop?  Ok, here you're really talking about camping a spot
for experience, not drops, but I think the principle is the same.  Since
CoH is pretty much equipmentless (at least compared to EQ) the "drops" that
concern most players the most are experience and to a lesser degree
influence.  In EQ, after a certain point, you pretty much have to camp
stuff to improve you character to the point where he/she can keep up with
similarly leveled characters, or to solo effectively if that is your
thing.  In CoH, you go fight something or do a particular mission, think to
yourself "Self, that was fun!" then move on to the next battle, rather than
doing that fight another twenty five times hoping the elusive Condom of
Quickness finally drops.

   Still, there are power gamers in CoH, players who sink huge amounts of
time into leveling as quickly as possible.  I don't really know why, but
they do seem to exist.  But if you don't want to play as a power gamer,
then CoH is more friendly to that sort of play style than EQ is.

All my humble opinion, of course.

EQ player for four years, retired.

CoH player for all but the first two weeks of release because I had to
upgrade my vid card!
