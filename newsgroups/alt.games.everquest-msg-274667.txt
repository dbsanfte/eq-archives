...oddly enough, your own cite supports my use of the term. You're
being willfully stubborn and ignorant. This is passive-aggressive
behavior. You're using this behavior to provoke another into
hostility.

No, I'm not psychic. But I'm also not stupid. Your intent is plainly
obvious. I don't have to be psychic to see it. You're carefully
maneuvering others into flaming you with non-aggressive but still
intentionally frustrating behavior. You're going out of your way to
piss people off without attacking them directly so you can climb up on
your high horse when they snap at you.
