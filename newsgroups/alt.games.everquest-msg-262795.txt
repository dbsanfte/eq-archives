No, this is not a dickwaving thread.

It's just that this is a question I am being asked more and more often.
I'm not talking about clerics asking me once I'm in the group, so they know
when to CH.  I'm completely fine with that.   This is when people who ask me
this information before inviting me to a group, with the clear implication
that if I don't measure up to whatever level they think I should, they will
not be inviting me.

Personally, I find it intrusive, and a bit offensive.  So far I have been
answering them, when they come in because I have LFG up, but each time it
pisses me off a bit more. Why is it ok for people to turn me down based
soley on the gear I'm wearing... yet other classes aren't subject to the
same kind of standards?   Why are the clerics not getting grilled about how
much FT they have, or wizards needing to answer "Do you have at least 3
level 65+ nuke spells yet?" before getting invited? Why the double standard
on warriors?    Or are these things happening to other people?   Has it now
become standard practice to try and form groups this way, trying to wait and
only get the uberest people to join you?

I suppose I can sort of see the point, if you're planning on going somewhere
extremely hard.   Like Tpit / Vxed trials, or Murramite Proving Ground.  It
would kind of suck to take the effort of putting together a group balanced
enough to fight there, just to find out your tank nearly gets one rounded by
the common mobs.  But I'm getting asked this by groups in freaking Wall of
Slaughter.

So... what do you guys think?   Am I overreacting, or does this seem out of
line to anyone else?   Is this going to be the way of the game?   "Plz send
link to ur magelo so we know if we want 2 invite u."


(Although, overreacting or not, unsolicited tells of "hp / ac?"  when I'm in
PoK without LFG on are definitely either getting ignored or a response of
"Who the fuck are you and why do you care?")
