I did, but the complete picture would have required a number of
/reports to be issued - he never actually said he wasn't paying me.
Once he got what he wanted, he didn't say squat. So I'd have had to
provide a lot of evidence to demonstrate the case, and I didn't really
care to go through that much effort.

I do have my logs, and screenshots, but of course Verant won't accept
those as proof (and well they shouldn't).

Not a bad thought - Perhaps I should petition him just to ensure that
there is some paper trail.
