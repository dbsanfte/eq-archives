The basic concern (one of many) was that drop rates could/would be
manipulated by SOE to generate increased transfer fees (in this case
the poster thought of a percentage of sale fee, something like how
EBAY gets some/most? of its revenues).

I was pointing out that to actively carryout such a manipulation would
require SOE commit resources to both monitor as well as determine just
what drop rate manipulations are needed to "maximize revenues", unless
you think they would do this by the seat of their pants. The
commitment of resources would obviously count against the revenues
generated to yield profits (if any) from the activity.

To answer the comment, of course the users ultimately pay for anything
SOE chooses to do that requires resources. My opinion is that the
revenues that would be generated from an authorized item transfer
process would probably not generate (or be unlikely to generate)
sufficient revenue to justify the resource commitment to manipulate
the ingame drop rates.

Note that my point is based on a presumption that SOE is not actually
selling ingame items for cash.
