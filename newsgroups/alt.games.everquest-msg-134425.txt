Yes, true, a valid point.  Maybe not poly.  My main point was just that 
'swinging' sounds like something you do in a playground (well, ok, maybe 
it is. :) ) It just sounds kinda lame to me, and I wish there was a better 
word.  Recreational sex would be a better name, but again it includes more 
than just swinging.

Eh, it's a pointless whinge.  Forget it. :)

}For the most part I avoid debates on nomenclature and opt for the
}blunt approach.

Generally a good approach. :)
