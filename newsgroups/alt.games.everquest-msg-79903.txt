Yeah, there are definite ones in SoV like that.  Another one that
might be like that is the quest from Befallen that leads to Qeynos
Hills and involves a few NPCs there (I don't know if this is there in
the current version of Befallen).  People who did their GBS hunting by
doing that quest and killing Pyz at the stage of the quest where the
story required her to have a GBS always got a GBS.  Those that killed
her earlier in that quest, before the story required her to have it,
got it at its normal drop rate.

My guess is that they have had since day one the ability to script
spawns and drops so that they are very dynamic, but that they simply
have not used this ability very often.  They only use it when a quest
or zone designer decides to do something special, like the ring war
stuff, or the Befallen story, or the rare spawn cycle in Frontier
Mountains.
