You might want to reconsider your theory.

I play a mage, my pets tend to con dark blue, but not always.

However, using the con as a measuring tool might not be the best idea. The
con does not display powerlevel (for lack of a better word) it predicts the
outcome of a fight between you and the target. A white con is supposed to
have just as big a chance of winning, but this does not take into account
variables suchs as armor and equipment.

As a ranger, I cannot stand toe to toe with a dark blue drachnid, I'll get
pummled into a bloody heap. But with my trusty bow, I root kite whites and
even yellows.

The point being, the con is not a good way of assessing the strenght of your
pet for a mage might have a hard time killing his own pet, while a enchanter
can take his down with little trouble.
