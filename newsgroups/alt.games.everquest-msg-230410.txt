Newbie here
Bazaar pricing seems incredibly high  which leads me to think that people
must cheat in some way
Reason
Bought a weapon for 19 plat (some wanted 100) used it for a while just to
test a skill really sold it back to a merchant who offered me 4 plat
Ok I learnt a lesson but whilst there I noticed people asking for thousands
of plat for different things - surely the prices people ask can not be
obtained playing the game normally

What also leads me to think this is the neverending adverts "40.000 plat
every hour"

Can items be obtained at such high levels playing normally or are bazaar
prices being driven higher by people cheating in some mannor?
