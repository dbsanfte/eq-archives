Your reply shows a lack of understanding of my post.  Either I was 
unclear or your reading comprehension needs work.

I'm saying that capitalism is not like communisism or democracy, "well 
intentioned but in the end it just doesn't work out"... and then 
specifically objecting to the "well intentioned" part.  Which I'm hoping 
is ironic, in that most people would expect an objection to the "doesn't 
work out" part; I don't actually agree or disagree with that portion. 
See, its funny!  OK, not if I have to explain it, but perhaps in the 
future when a similar joke is made you'll be able to see it.

Your response doesn't discuss his position that capitalism is well 
intentioned, in fact if anything it seems to say that he too feels that 
the system isn't well intentioned after all.
