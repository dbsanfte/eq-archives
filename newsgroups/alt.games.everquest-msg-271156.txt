I guess that is why they cannot produce iPods fast enought to meet 
demand, eh? I guess that is why they have partnered with HP who has 
greater manufacturing capability to meet demand and yet when I went to 
Best Buy Christmas shopping I couldn't find one of those in stock either.

Apple didn't create their own demise with proprietary software. They are 
still in business and doing very well although I know what you are 
referring to. They have had some significant ups and downs over the years.

Perhaps Apple still would be number one if Bill Gates hadn't stolen 
their best ideas and created a substandard excuse for an operating 
system but marketed it so well and played so dirty over the years that 
when all was said and done, despite the lawsuits and their ulimate 
conviction as corparate criminals, nobody else was left standing in the 
PC applications market but guess who. I ran a software store (Egghead) 
back when there was a healthy PC applications market and saw it all. I 
hate Microsoft personally and would always choose any alternative I 
could to something produced by them, such as the WMA format when I could 
have MP3 instead. I'd rather have Quicktime than Windows Media Player 
anyday and for the one place I watch video reviews (Gamespot) I can.

Im sorry, but the fact is that while Microsoft over the years has had 
few ideas to call their own that they could be proud of, Apple has been 
an innovator since their inception in somebody's garage. The iPod is 
just the latest example of this. Why should they support WMA? Why should 
anyone? We already had standards. But as is usual for Microcrap they 
then create a new format that is completely incompatible with everything 
else under the sun and then given their OS monopoly foist it on their 
users. What was wrong with mp3? Ummm, nothing? Did we need WMA? Umm, nope.

Anyways, if you want WMA I'm sure you can get a MP3 player that supports 
it from Creative or whomever. But why you would when the iPod is 
available I don't know. I got my daughter one for Christmas at her 
request and I was quite pleased to buy this innovate excellent product 
from Apple, even if it was something of a struggle to locate one given 
their popularity.

With mp3 and iTunes, why would you want WMA anyways? To get files from 
Microsoft that are WMA only? Is there anyplace else that you can only 
find things in that format worth listening to? Maybe there is. I don't 
follow this stuff too closely. And of course you can easily create your 
own mp3's so it isn't like you need Windows media player for anything.

I am still hoping that we someday all move to Linux and that free 
software drives MS under the way they did WordPerfect, Ashton-Tate, 
Borland and so many others. As Linux matures and improves it's going to 
be increasingly hard for them to compete with software that becomes 
superior and is free. The underlying OS already is superior. It's just a 
matter of time for the desktop and applications to come up to snuff.

Sorry, wandered way off topic there but it's kind of hard to listen to 
someone insult Apple when the likes of Microsoft is the real reason 
there are not as many choices as there might be.
