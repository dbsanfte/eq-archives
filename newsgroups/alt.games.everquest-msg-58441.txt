I would check to see if you have multiple devices sharing IRQs.  I 
personally don't like my devices sharing that way and try to get them all 
on their own.  If I have no use for my serial ports or parallel port, I 
disable them on all my machines to free up the IRQs for devices that can 
use them.

I'm running Win2K Pro at home on 2 of the boxes, but can't give you step-
by-step 'structions on how to check on the IRQ sharing like I could with 
all the previous versions, but I will look tonight if you would like.

I'm from the school of thought: Just because it -can- do it, doesn't mean 
it should.  NO IRQ SHARE FOR YOU!

I'm still running an old AWE-64 Gold because it was pretty nice in its day 
( composing music and the such ), and now I am antsy about upgrading until 
these apparent problems with newer SB cards and Win2K get ironed out.
