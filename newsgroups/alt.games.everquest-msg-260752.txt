Wow. I don't necessarily call that any kind of bargain. O_o

It's all about what the market will bear, unfortunately. Damned nerfed silk 
drop rates. Did they just do that to give new players another option for 
coming into some quick cash? Can you say throw the baby out with the 
bathwater?

Pardon me. I'm bitter. I looked into working up fishing the other night and 
got the idea to make some stat bonus lures. Right. Each combine attempt 
requires 1 silk thread (2-spiderling silks). *If* you're successful, you 
wind up likely investing 10-15pp on a lure that may well be consumed 
catching a tatterd cloth sandal or rusty dagger. Now imagine that return on 
investment after failing once or twice on that lure combine to begin with. 
It's stupid. :(
