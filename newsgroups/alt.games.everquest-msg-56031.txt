If large numbers of people in a zone didn't cause lag and stutter, for many
people, I'd take your point.
The problem isn't the person followings' intelligence it is a game limited
by lag and frame rate.

Who do you want to follow on a raid?  Someone who is smart enough to
understand the games limitations and has the willingness to over come those
limitations or a leader who expects everyone to have no lag or screen
stutter?
