In answer to your followup...QUIT TANKING. :)   There's really no
contest...primarily you're going to want WIS over AC.

Hell, I think my 52 druid (pretty much abused) is still wearing a foreman's
tunic for regular use, and a BCP for when he's primary healer and likely to
be beat on.

Level 1 casters, except clerics, aren't designed to get hit so AC isn't one
of the "important" stats.   Hell, STR is more likely to be desired to carry
all that loot if you didn't twink him with a tinkerer's bag. :)
