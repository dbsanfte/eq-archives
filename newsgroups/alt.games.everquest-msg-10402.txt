I think what they meant is that since both fish and bat wings are
easy to come by (either by fishing/killing bats yourself, or buying
them cheaply from appropriate vendors), it's "easy" (simple) to raise your
baking skill by doing basically nothing but fish rolls from 1-135.
It's also easier doing just one thing forever (less to remember,
fewer ingredients to carry) than to keep switching from one
"skill-appropriate" thing to another as your skill goes through
various ranges.

But that's not the same thing as saying that it's "easy" to bake
them (i.e., succeed and get a food product as opposed to getting
the "you lack the skill" failure message).

If you primarily want to work on increasing your baking skill,
fish rolls are great and simple/easy.  But if you want to
make a lot of food products along the way while you increase
your skill, you'll have to instead bake things that are
"easier" to bake (i.e., require a lower skill level and are
more likely to succeed).

Again, check www.eqtraders.com, under "Trade Supplies".  That will
show that the closest Ore vendor for you is Erudin.

See the lower half of:  http://www.eqtraders.com/learn/learn_pottery.htm

It's not -- you could reach 200 skill in every tradeskill
(and 255 in one of your choice) while still a level 1 newbie
(as long as you had the money to buy the necessary supplies).

Fighting skills, and many other skills (e.g. swimming) do
have a "cap per level", but tradeskills don't.
