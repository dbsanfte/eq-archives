Consider Marus Seru, though I'm not sure how it would be for kiting.  Some
of the creatures will be green/light blue, but you should have plenty of
dark blue mobs.  The problem with kiting might be adds, but if you can charm
rockhoppers or rhino beetles you have a ready supply of pets.  Charm a
hooper, send it in against a stonegrabber, which should kill it, then finish
off the stonegrabber.  Tactics courtesy of a non-druid.
