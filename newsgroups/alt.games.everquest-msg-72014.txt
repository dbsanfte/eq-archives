Yep, exactly. In this case I think the money sink is just far too
large. Even someone who buys the 9 k or 18 k horse is then going to
say, "now that I have this horse I will scrounge for the 100 k horse."
The problem is they will want to sell 10 k or so items such as sarnak
battle shields, barbed ringmail and the old standby noct blade to do
this. Everyone who would have the 10 for those is also hoarding horse
money though. Everyone becomes miserly and you cant sell fantastic
items for 500 plat even. No one is trading for those 10 k items either
since everyone is holding out for cash for the horsies from them.

Not now, horsies have killed that but they've killed it too much.
The problem is that verant made too many horses with a top one priced
at over 100 k plat. That is nuts. I'll never see 100 k plat at one
time and I'm level 55. I've never known any player with 100 k plat.
Now every player is going to try to get 100 k plat though, even after
they buy an earlier horse (actually ESPECIALLY after that)
This is going to tie up plat in players banks for eons as they
scrounge for money, its also going to kill high end trading.

Yeah that is an old request but it only works on text muds with a
player base of 200 or less people and item deathtraps. I played on
such a mud which worked quite well. You had maybe 200 players max on
it and some good item would only spawn 4 times in existance then
someone would have to delete their char or the item or die in a death
trap (where all your items are destroyed and then any ones which were
at MAX can be put back on the mobs)

It worked quite well for a small server world of 200 people or less
which had deathtraps and was a free text mud at a university,  but it
won't work on a server of 5,000 or more players who pay money. Paying
customers want and expect more and they sure won't tolerate the item
deletion that is needed to go hand in hand with limited number items. 
The reason why item deletion would be needed was otherwise you'd have
X player hogging the single drop or less than 10 drop of X item
forever, effectively removing it totally from the game.

I always thought that also. For example, on my 55 druid I gave up on
tradeskills and went out and got good equipment instead. Now for about
the first time there would be good druid wearable trade skill equip in
the form of acryla, but the problem is I already have better really ;)
You also have to be pretty high level to survive getting the drops and
the drops are quit rare. So what happens is its easier for you to get
better items yourself than it is to make these items yourself.
That is kind of a flaw in the game.

The problem comes when everyone else wants the same thing. You end up
with everyone trying to sell and no one trying to buy. I'm already
seeing this in EC on the trib server, in a very bad way.

Really with horses and the prices they are, in order to have the
economy viable again you need LARGE CASH vendor sellable items
dropping on NPCs more, like gems or for the npcs to drop more cash.
Right now we have a lock on it because:

1) all players want big horsie cash
2) all players trying to sell things for large amounts of plat for big
horsie cash
3) since all players doing this, no one is buying equals people
hoarding to try to sell for cash but no one is wanting to buy but only
sell.
4) this is a detriment to the economy because it locks it up with no
items changing hands and no plat changing hands. 

This money sink is too good and needs a nerf.
