Find me a successful guild that works on random, and then you'll have an 
argument, otherwise knock it off.

No, actually one of the reasons this cleric left was because we gave a 
spell to a new comer.  And she gave us hell for not giving it to her 
husband first.

Who said ANYTHING about not giving loot to newcomers?  It's a straw man 
argument.

This is the type of attitude I'm ranting about.  Self before guild in a 
team based environment?  It's the attitude I'm ranting about.  By putting 
themselves before the guild, they are screwing THEMSELVES in the long run.

It's also impossible for /random loot to completely fair as well.

Only if they can't see more than 5 min in the future.  If they can't, then 
the game is doomed to end for us anyhow.

Um, no.  I came here and ranted about the self before guild attitude.  I 
was pissed about that and the absolute drama she caused over the issue.  We 
don't desperately need her.  We may have lost 1 cleric but we have 2 or 3 
other cleric apps who see nothing wrong with the way things are done.
