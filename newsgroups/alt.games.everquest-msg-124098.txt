You realize the ideas that the earth is round, revolves around the
sun, and the stars are more than just "leftover light" God scattered
in the sky after he created the sun were once considered as whacky as
a lot of those that you just listed are considered now...

I don't beleive everything I read in the Enquirer or everything John
Edwards spouts (as he runs laughing to the bank), but I do accept that
there is far more out there than our science today understands.
