From a CBC news article quoting a study of the actual effectiveness of
various attempts to reduce teenage pregnancy:

"Abstinence programs, which are very popular in the Unites States
since
the Bush administration has backed them, are the worst... The
pregnancy rate of young women in abstinence studies actually went up."

This from a study conducted by McMaster University.   I don't have a
link to the whole article anymore, sorry.  I can e-mail the full text
to anyone interested.

It agrees with everything I have heard from youth workers.  Teaching
abstinence is not realistic and encourages self-loathing.  This, in
combination with guilt feelings and lack of education, maked it less
likely that a young person will practice safer-sex.
