After looking throught the eqclient.ini there is a line that reads: 
ChatFontSize=1 (mine is set to 1 anyway).

Go into your Everquest folder and locate said file, open it with a text 
editor, and change the line to the number you desire i.e. ChatFontSize=3 
This should do the trick.

After looking further at the file there are also some other entries.
MyHitsFontSize=1, OtherHitsMeFontSize=1 etc. You may also need to do a find 
font in your editor and edit these values as well.

Hope this helps.
