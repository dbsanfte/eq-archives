Under UK retail laws once a price is negotiated there is a contract in
force between buyer and seller, but it's the seller who is obliged to
sell at that price and abide by the laws, not the buyer. Buyers have all
sorts of rights to protect them from unscrupulous sellers. (The one
where you have a legal right to return faulty goods to the retailer, not
the manufacturer, is one that's often violated.)

I don't know if that applies to Ebay sales, but I suspect it does,
especially if you buy from an Ebay "shop".
IANAL, etc.
