Well since I regularly play both a Mage and a Necro, I would say that your
right.  Now I will say this, there have been many times when my Mage wished
he could summon a corpse (usually his own), however I wish that Necros got
to summon corpses earlier in their careers.  What would be nice however
would be if there were a magic item available that would summon corpses
(similar to the idea of a chipped bone rod locating them).
