      The primary role in an XP-grind is damage-dealing, but there are
a LOT more things you can do if the group needs it.  Necros are the
most flexible of the INT-caster classes.  You have a good deal of
crowd control:  root, fear, an undead-only charm, and a short mez.
Or just sic your pet on the add.  You have snares if need be.  If
you're fighting undead, you can slow.  If your party is heavy on
casters, you can debuf fire/poison/disease resists.  You have
nukes to spam casters with to kill them quickly, if inefficiently;
they even have a built-in stun for automatic spell disruption.
If your party has a shaman, you and he are the only healers you'll
need.

Keep Gate or Feign Death handy.  Should go without saying, really.
The rest depends on what you're fighting and what the party needs.

Pure DOTs:  as soon as the tank engages, unless another caster is
debuffing magic resists or mezzing adds (sometimes the mezzer and
tank have to swap targets because the original one has a magic
resist too high to mez easily).  Then wait for those spells to land.
(Hotkey the /assist command and learn how to use it to ensure you're
casting on the same mob the main tank (MT) is tanking.  DOTs and mezzes
don't mix!)

Nukes: ask a wiz for more info. :)  Typically not until the mob is
heavily damaged.

Everything else:  as soon as you know the tank has accumulated enough
hate that you won't attract the monster's attention.  Spells that cause 
some damage right away (including DD/DOT hybrids like Envenomed Bolt),
and spells that debuff/slow/snare, create a lot of hate immediately.
If you've never grouped before, this will be the hardest thing to learn.

Raids are an entirely different story.  Transfering your mana to other
casters happens frequently.  There's also a lot of uses for Dead Man
Floating, and sometimes Invis to Undead.
