Well, got back on and took a run around and all I can say is "Wow"!  I
forgot how pretty this game can be at times.  Turned on all the eye ca
ndy for the first time since launch.  Quite a different experience.

Now some of this comes from the new DX9 rendering engine, part from
the how the video card renders does its job, and part from the eye
candy I'm sure.  I know there are subtle differences between how the
manufacturers will display a scene.  I was generall under the
impression that ATI has a more pleasing asthetic.

But as for the game itself.  Starting up is not noticeable different
at all.  I think this is due to my craptacular Quantum Fireball HDD
limiting the system more than anything else.  This is due for an
upgrade in September, so I shoudl be able to tell by then for sure.  

Once I'm actually in the game, it is smooth as silk.  Aside from the
bazaar, I've experienced no client-side hiccups.  Server-side lag
still makes the game stutter, but graphically everything is smooth.
I'm not sure if the 256MB on the 9600 is the big contibutor or not,
but I might borrow a Ti4400 to see the differnece.  Having all the
textures in RAM probably the big boost there.

Anyways, it feels like I've a brand new game with 5-year old
charcters.  I think I'm gonna go get a sow and run through the
continents...
