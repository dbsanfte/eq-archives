I wouldn't call it "too easy", but I would call it less substantial and 
less rewarding. My time with WoW felt like I was just eating the icing 
off of my cake. Sure, it's the good part, but without the cake, it gets 
old pretty fast.

Beyond that I agree with you. I think having to kill hundreds of 
placeholder mobs is a poor design as well. The effort in getting a major 
quest mob to spawn shouldn't be one of tedium, but of productive effort 
and accomplishment. Instead of making us kill everthing in the zone to be 
sure to get the correct placeholders, we should have to, for example, 
kill progressively more difficult lieutenant-class mobs, possibly under 
varyingly difficult circumstances. I felt the PoJ trials were ingenious 
in that regard.
