Someone at work was just telling me of his first trip to PoG.  By the end of
it, when they killed Tunare, all the factions he was taking hits on were at
the "could not get worse" stage.  He's a Barbarian Warrior.

Afterwards, he went to GFay to see how bad that was.  The guards still
regarded him warmly.  He went up into Kelethin, and wandered around over to
the Druids guild and the Warriors guild, and they were all still regarding
him warmly.  Some merchants were aprehensive, that he *thinks* were not
before.  He didn't check the Rangers guild.

I thought killing in PoG was pretty much "you'll never want to show you face
anywhere near Kelethin again" bad, but it doesn't appear to be.  What does
he actually have to watch out for now that he's bottomed out all the PoG
factions?
