Hi everyone:

I've been having a great time playing a Necromancer after years of Wizard
life. I've been in no hurry to level, none at all, so I've been spending
virtually all my time farming cash so I might buy *decent* items. With the
Wizard, Flowing Thought was rather obviously what one would want, but the
Necro (so far as I can see) would do better wearing regeneration items. I
have a ZHeart, Gold-Buckled Belt, Robe of Abrogation and a Frost Covered
Cape, for a total health regeneration of 11 per tick.

So to my question: What other items might my Necro *buy* that offers health
regeneration? I'm currently level 36.

Many thanks in advance.

Stevie.
