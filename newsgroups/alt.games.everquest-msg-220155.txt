Humans can over ride the need to mate that is the ONLY thing that
makes us better the other animals. Your cat or dog do this... 

Its madness to not fix your pet if there in no market for said pet
(IE> dog with papers or show cat that wins

Humans are the smartest and the most stupid animals on the planet and
the stupid show it by having (UNwanted Children) or (NO ability to
take care of Children) or (More then then one dad Children)  and yes
stupid one seem to out number the smart ones. As long as we tax payer
are feeding and housings the drug using baby having lower forms of
human life the world is in danger as less people working mean less
food and for all. 

Should we fix them {NO!} {NEVER} and over my DEAD BODY even the most
stupid out there have more rights and is smarter then the smartest dog
or cat that is just life. even the stupid humans can control them self
just do not...

Cats and Dogs CAN NEVER CONTROL THEM SELFS and i know first hand that
my dogs had papers we had a 12 foot fence (steel posts welded
together) with a cement base and electric fence at the base and top
and our Male would find ways in anyway. 

      wounder if this post even makes cents
