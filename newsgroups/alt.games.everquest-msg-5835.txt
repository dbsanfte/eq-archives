While it's pretty silly to "buy" these items (since raising baking
skill is trivial), you gotta remember that these stat bonuses come
from an item that's sitting in your backpack.  This is important since
traditionally NO item that gives stat bonuses would take effect
sitting in a backpack.  It's like having a free slot where you can
place items which give different stat bonuses.

A few of the items give bonuses as high as 3.
The ones that really interest me are the items that give resist
bonuses.

A freebie slot that gives +3 vs disease/poison or 3 vs magic?  Hell,
I'd say that's a pretty damn nice thing.
