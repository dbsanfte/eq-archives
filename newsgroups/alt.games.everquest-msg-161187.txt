Ok, fine. Let's consider someone who has perhaps watched a friend play
and maybe even played one of the friend's character a little - enough
to be certain they want to get into EQ and experience it in all its
splendor. They shouldn't have to go on a payment plan ($30 a month or
however often they can buy another expansion) to be able to afford
getting there. Being an adult with a bit of disposable income, I can
manage, though I feel it's getting to be a bit much. I can imagine how
a teenager or college-aged person would find it prohibitive.

Also, I don't know. Frankly, after experiencing and playing with the
SoL models and other graphics, I view the original models as extremely
inferior and can't imagine going back to them aside from situations of
extreme necessity (huge raids perhaps).
