You can wait till they wear off (3-5 mins). If you find yourself
fighting mobs with DSs, take some time and observe them. If the mob is
the caster that applied the shield you can record the time between
casts (when they refresh). Once you get the timing down, just pull
when they are about to wear off. 

Easy to do if you are a FD class, but can be down by just about anyone
with a little patience. :-)
