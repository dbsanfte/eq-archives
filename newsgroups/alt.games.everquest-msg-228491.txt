I keep hearing people whine and bitch about "carebear" rules, so here
they go, have another underpopulated, pointless, noone-will-play server
like the zek's. *shrug* I'd like to see a server like FV, only without
the stupid TLC, before seeing something like this. Or a server where
there is no no_drop, period.
