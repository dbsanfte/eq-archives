It's not really accurate to say that they are angles.  Each of the F9
modes, of which there are five, are really different ways of
positioning the camera.  From memory, they are:

1) First person
2) Overhead view... camera can move vertically, and can tilt up or
down.  Always faces the direction you are facing (like 1)
3) Camera is above and behind.  Camera can move vertically, tilt up
and down, in and out.  Camera always faces the direction you are
facing (like 1 and 2)
4) Camera can pivot around you, move vertically, and in and out. 
Camera keeps you in the center of the screen.  Camera stays looking at
you from a fixed direction, south, for example, while you turn and run
around.
5) Exactly like 4, except camera tilts up or down... doesn't need you
to be in the center of the screen.

I usually use 1, but sometimes use 5 (when kiting).  In rare
circumstances, where I'm kiting through trees, I use 3 so that I don't
smack into the trees.


To adjust the camera, you use the ALT+(Insert, Delete, Page Up, Page
Down) buttons.  It's all in the manual, I think.
