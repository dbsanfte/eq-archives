eqinterface.com has a lot of skins like that, I doubt you'll find better
than what's there.  Personally I like a "pretty" skin and it doesn't seem
like very many people make them... mostly sci-fi type skins and very compact
and informational skins.  However... if anyone does like graphical skins,
there's a great set of beastlord skins (search for Beastlord on
eqinterface.com and you'll find it, it's by a guy named Oguler), and one I
personally like and am using for my pally alt called StoneAngel.  I like the
StoneAngel2.0 graphics better than StoneAngel3.0, but the old skin doesn't
work with the new UI, so I modified it to work.  If anyone wants it let me
know.

As far as compact and informational skins, tho, eqinterface has them all
pretty much.  I don't think anyone here will be able to give you a better
selection, could be wrong tho...
