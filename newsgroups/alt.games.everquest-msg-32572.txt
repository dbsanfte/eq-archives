I agree to some extent but if your Healer sets a hot key to announce what
type of heal so an so is getting the other tanks know to take a look at the
Healer to see if he is going to need assistance if the mob agros proper
action needs to be taken. The say thing goes for Nuking and DOTs. If at all
possible everyone should concentrat on the same mob and take them out 1 at a
time. As any Cleric very soon relizes to make a hot key saying  Cleric
geting butt kicked need help NOW. and use it quickly dont bother trying to
root the mob or try taking it on get help.
