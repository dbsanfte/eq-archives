Nope.

I am sick of people bashing ATI, and repsonding to posts from ATI
owners with "Go get a GF-blah blah blah". It's stupid and doesn't help
the poster. I swear most GF users spend more time "playing" 3dMark2001
than games. Of course that toned down a bit when the Radeon 8500
produced higher numbers when released. Then again the GF4s are out, so
it is safe to assume 3dMark2001 is once again the favorite past-time
of NVidia fan-boys.

I own cards from both companies. (GF1, GF2, GF3, Radeon LE, Radeon
8500),  

Cards from both companies have their pluses and minuses. All of them
can run EQ:SoL if you get the right driver set and tweak the settings
to allow for the different amounts of memory (32 or 64). The Radeons
produce much better color and image quality to my eyes.

Funny how an objective opinion of the Radeon leads some to think I
work for the company.
