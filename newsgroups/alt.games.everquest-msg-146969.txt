You posted 'this cannot happen.' as an absolute statement. This patently
can and does happen.

Whether it happened in this case I don't know - it seems far more likely
the kid left in the chair pressed ok to something to me. Regardless, you
do people a disservice with inaccuracies like the one quoted.

I have no idea if there are pop up advertisers who would knowingly use
bugs to get their software on your systems. I've never investigated, I dont
use IE, and I dont really care as it doesnt impact me.

I wouldnt be at all surprised
to learn there were, in the name of leveraging casinos, gator, porn, or
whatever they made their bucks from.
