    Some dagger with an 8/25 ratio and some minor stats dropped randomly for
my 27 necro in Netherbian Lair the other day. My first instinct was to hand
it to my pet. Go go mudflation!

    I'd pay 150 pp for one in a heartbeat considering it'll sell to Bubar
the vendor for 200 pp with bad CHA. :-) I recently won a Jaundiced Bone Helm
in Sebilis, and for the first time instead of trying to sell it in EC I sold
it to a vendor for 333 pp. Feels wrong to do stuff like that, but like you
said you could sit in EC forever and not sell something like that which has
become that common.
