Ah I'm on a tnt 16 meg agp, and only problem I had after recent patch
was missing the fine lines in full screen transparent view around the
buff box and throughout the borders of the inventory (so I had no
borders), and the fine lines at the loading blue bar that moves
across. Oh, and I had no full screen transparent polygon shade
ability.

I kept trying different drivers and finally found the 21.83 ones to
work so now i have fine lines again.. I found them on 

www.guru3d.com

I switched my card to pci (vga) as it said to then unisntalled my
23.11 drivers and such then installed the 21.83. First I did that
uninstalling and trying the 23.11 again to no avail.. still no lines.
21.83 seems fine for me but I never had a crashing problem anyway.
