I've got a moral dilemma.  On my way from North Freeport to West Freeport
the other night, this Iksar took a look at what I was carrying.  Being a
level 2 bard, it wasn't much.  He gave me 2 earrings, and kept insisting
until I took them.  So I finally did, and he told me to buy some good stuff.
Anyway, curiosity got the better of me, so I sold the things to a merchant,
and got 128 flipping platinum pieces (!!!)  for the pair.  I bought a decent
sword, a shield, a bag, a lute and a pair of leather shoulder pads (all
non-magical) but I still have somewhere in the neighbourhood of 200+ plats
left.  I feel kinda bad about accepting the things, and was thinking I could
take the money, and just drop it on the ground near somewhere and pretend it
doesn't exist.

I dunno.  256 platinum pieces is a hell of a lot for a level 2 bard who
wants to play a (reasonably) fair character.

Thanks for listening.

Paul
