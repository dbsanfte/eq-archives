I used to use it when I wanted to measure my run speed.  I'd find a flat
place, like one of the Karanas, use True North to get facing exactly north,
then hit run.  I'd hit my /loc macro with one hand and start a stopwatch at
the same time with another.  Run for, say, about 10 seconds, and hit /loc
again while stopping the stopwatch.  Then, compute speed by distance
travelled divided by elapsed time.  By making sure I was going exactly
north, only one of the coordinates would change, so computing the distance
was a simple subtraction.

Not all that useful to most, but to those of us who liked to try to work out
the formulas behind EQ, it helped a little.

Well, if EQ still has situations where you want to stack up on as many buffs
as you can, in the hopes that a dispell will take something useless, this is
one more to throw on.  There was a mask that had this, or something similar,
as a click effect, which made it convenient.

The way we used to use this, back in the old days, was when we were getting
beat up and wanted to run.  Channel Fade through the beating, to get
yourself far enough ahead of the mob to run.  I don't recall the range of
Fade, so this might not be that useful until you get the higher spells in
this line.

Isn't it useful for seeing friendly players who are trying to lead you
invisibly through some dangerous area?  I seem to recall groups having
someone cast see invis on everyone, then someone would invis everyone, and
then we'd run through some dangerous place where we did not wish to fight.

There was one quest in Qeynos where the NPC you were looking for had a
summoned pet, and you could use this to find him.  That's the only use I
ever found for it.  I wonder if that quest is still there?
