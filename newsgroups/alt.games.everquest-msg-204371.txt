I'm one of the ones that bitched about pets breaking mezzes after every 
claim that they fixed it.  I bitched because they lie about it over and 
over and. . .

Up until now, because of the pet mez-breaking problem, I've been casting 
BSpirit/Bedlam on either the rogue I'm PLing ( if I didn't have KEI ) or on 
me ( if I did ) and pull with slow and let the rogue kill it.  On a whim, I 
decided to test the mez-breaking again last night.

I pulled with slow, let the mob hit me, then cast a low mez at around 20-
25% health depending on the mob.  Mob is mezzed, pet backs off, I blur it, 
rogue finishes it.  Worked every time, no mez breaks ...

... except when there were multiple mobs beating on my pet, then he would 
consistantly break mez right after it was cast.  After a bit of trial and 
error, I could figure out the timing on mezzing one so he wouldn't break 
mez, but it was easier to pull one off the pet and mez if after splitting 
them or not allow the situation to happen in the first place.

It's a simple problem to get around, but pets breaking mez still isn't 
fixed all the way.
