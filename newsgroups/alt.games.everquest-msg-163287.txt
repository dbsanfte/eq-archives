Pretty much, and it's infuriating as hell.  That, and it's insistance on
adding markup every time you start writing somewhere else.  I'm getting sick
of seeing [MM1 Miller] pop up every time I try to start typing something.

That doesn't piss me off as much as Windows "intellignent" highlighting.
Click in the middle of a word, because that's where you want to start
highlighting.  Drag the cursor and... what?  Why is the beginning of the
word highlighted now?

It's stuff like this that makes me sure that the computers will never take
over.  One misplaced semicolon will end the revolution  (and, odds are, it's
actually in the right place, MS just doesn't realize it).  Saddly, if the
computers did take over, the world would probably be run like the DMV.
