I have never had the, um, pleasure, of working with Visual Fortran.  Fortran
77, and predecessors and successors on the other hand, I have played around
with, even got paid to do it for a while.  Nothing wring with Fortran as
such, but I shudder to think what Visual Fortran was like, having
experienced Visual Basic, albeit only briefly, an experience I will endeavor
not to repeat.  Now, if you want a fun, language in which to code write only
software, try APL.
