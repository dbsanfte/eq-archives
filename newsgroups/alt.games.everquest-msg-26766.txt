For those that don't know, Poxor is an erudite enchanter who's using a
"feature" in the game to PK everyone at the Qeynos gates. I don't know
the exact details but he ends up getting all the guards at the gate to
kill whoever he wants.  And he's only level 13.,  Well last night, this
guy cost me an entire yellow of experience by sending the guards at me
at my bind spot.  Naturally they killed me instantly, every time, 5
times in a row before I ripped the phone line out of the wall.  and it's
not petitionable or reportable.  I've tried.  Others have tried.  So I
came up with this plan see.  I need a good player in the area to come
down and group with Poxor.  Convince him to hide with him in the hidden
wall with sewer entrance.  Than bind him.  As bind is being cast, EVERY
newt who wants to kill him should just barge in and start wailing on
him, if we have enough, he won't be able to move out of the area.  EVen
if he's invis.  He can't gate out cuz he's bound there and every time he
dies, we'll just kill him again.  Until he's so low in levels that he
can't use his stupid charming trick any more! MWHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! THAT
BASTARD IS GONNA FRY!!!! DIE POXOR DIE!  SEE POXOR DIE!!!! ALL NIGHT,
EVERY NIGHT, ON SULLON ZEK!!!!!
