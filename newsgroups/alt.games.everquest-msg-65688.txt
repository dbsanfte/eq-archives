From the eqmanual_supplement.doc in the EQ folder:

"First Aid:  (3 skill levels) - Each skill level increases the maximum
percentage of healing that the character can grant using the Bind
Wound skill.  The first skill level will increase the maximum by 10%,
the second by 20% and the third by 30%."

Now does this mean that the hit points healed from the bandage
go up? For example if I have a Bind would skill of 200 I normally
heal 50 points per bandage. Would this mean I could bandage
55, 60, and 65 points per bandage?

Or...

Does this mean that it increases the 50% maximum for healing
with bandages? Such that I can use my bandages to heal up
to 60%, 70%, and 80% of my total health using bandages?


Or...

Does it mean something else?
