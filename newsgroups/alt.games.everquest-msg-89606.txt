Exactly. It was the DE corrupter for the druid epic. The problem, of
course, is that you took a faction hit with the DE in Kith when the
corrupter died that prevented you from being able to redo the first part
of the quest without dragging a high level chanter with you to charm the
mob. And yes, replacing the item used to trigger the spawn would have
been acceptable, or at least better than nothing. The uber guild group
claimed that they were getting ready to trigger him themselves and they
thought that their druid had done it. They told the GM, "Gee, it was an
honest mistake on our part", although our earlier conversation with them
led us to believe it was anything but that in truth. 

In any case, my understanding is that Verant's policy says whoever hits
the mob first, gets it, and that deliberate kill stealing is a
punishable offense. There was no question that our group hit it first
and that the uber guild's group knew that we had and that they were
ks'ing it. There is also no question we would have been successful in
killing the corruptor; it wasn't the first time we had done it by any
means and he's a fairly easy kill. I simply think Verant CS staff has an
obligation to enforce the rules they make in a fair and consistent
manner, which the GM failed to do in this case, for whatever reason.
