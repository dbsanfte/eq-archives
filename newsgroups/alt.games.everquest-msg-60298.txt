First of all I would have to say no wonder you bards are likely to have
finger problems for the rest of your lives :-), I have enough trouble just
trying to hit hotkeys and spells in a fight myself, and I'm a Pally! :-)
Anyway yeah that sure rocks for soloing - as a Paladin my best would have to
be 4 mobs at once - 3 dark blue 1 light blue (one a wizard), but they were
all undead which helps :-).  Note that I DIDN'T have to use LoH - the catch
is I was not fighting all of them from the start - however I was fighting
all of them at one particular time.   But certainly doesn't come anywhere
near 6 wyverns at once, that is just HELLISH.  :-)
