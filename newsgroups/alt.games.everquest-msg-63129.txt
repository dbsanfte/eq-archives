And even if you tweaked the checksum to be appropriate,
it wouldn't help.

Even if you flogged your client-side in-memory inventory
to give yourself an Uber Axe of Nuking, the moment you
tried to give it to someone, the client would send a
request to the server saying, "I want to give my UAoN
to person X", and the server would say, "You don't
*have* one of those to give..."

The "master" copy of your character's data is always
on the server end.  The memory copy on the client side,
if any (some data is cached there, some never is) is
just so that some things can be done quickly on the
client side without sending traffic to the server
every time (like peeking at your inventory).  But
any "critical" operations are always done via requests
to the server itself.  There's no way to "fake out"
the server by fiddling with your client-side data.
