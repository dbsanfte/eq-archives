    Ok I'ma guess you're employing sarcasm there but for other people who
might not see it that way:

    Warriors still crap on knights as tanks, but knights are better at
grabbing agro quickly and holding it. Warriors are still very popular for
raid encounters and no doubt still popular in groups because they are a
superior tank, just not as convenient.
