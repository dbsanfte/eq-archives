I am *in favor* of the KEI nerf, however...

: If you think the game played as intended is too tedious and boring,
: find another game.

1. Discussing the downtime problem in EQ on a.g.e can be useful.
   It may elicit tips and tricks from more experienced players on
   how to minimize it.

2. Discussing the downtime problem in EQ on a.g.e could very well
   be noticed by SOE employees, prompting improvements in the game.

: EQ was a success long before KEI was introduced,
: and it will continue to be a success long after this current fix.

It could be argued that EQ is a success *despite* the downtime
problem.  It is a logical fallacy to imply that EQ's success means
there are no problems.
