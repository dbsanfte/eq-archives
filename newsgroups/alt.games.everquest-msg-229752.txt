From what I remember, the issues that rangers had in the Kunark era didn't
manifest themselves until the higher levels, when the skill points/gear/hit
point bonus difference really created a significant disparity between
rangers and warriors.  I certainly don't remember there being any
significant difference between the two classes before level 10.

As for why they're not doing particularly well compared to other classes,
well, track really isn't that big an advantage in straight levelling, and if
any ranger's trying to PvP extensively (a play style that doesn't net
experience), they'll probably find themselves on the losing end eventually.
There's nothing really that makes them superior levellers or meleers to any
other melee class at those levels.  Archery with the bows available would be
absurdly frustrating, not to mention rare, unless you were willing to blow
what little money you had on the stacks of arrows that it would take to
bring down an average level 6.
