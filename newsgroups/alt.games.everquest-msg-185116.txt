As someone who's pretty proud of having reached level 3 with their first
character, it's nice to hear about people doing things a bit closer to my
level!  I find a lot of what I read on this newsgroup pretty
incomprehensible and although I'm sure it'll all become clear when I've been
playing for a while, it's all pretty daunting and I appreciate hearing about
the little accomplishments.  Gives hope to the newbies among us!
