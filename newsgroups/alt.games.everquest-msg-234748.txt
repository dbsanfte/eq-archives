Erudite has good wizard stats, but night blindness, Dark Elf has good 
wizard stats, and no night blindness.  The two I have made so far have been 
gnome and froglok.

Ogre.  Of course I made mine a halfling, and the main tank in my guild is a 
halfling, so, it really doesn't matter that much.

Really, in the end, pick the race you want, equipment will make up for most 
of what is lacking stat wise anyway.  Remember, this is a game, have fun.
