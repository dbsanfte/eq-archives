Under the WE'RE NOT *FORCING* OUR LIFESTYLE ON ANYONE claim:


A Canadian human rights tribunal has ordered a city in British
Columbia to proclaim and advertise a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and
Transgender Pride Day even though the local council rejected the idea
as inappropriate, reports the National Post.

Ana Mohammed, a member of the human rights tribunal, said the city
council of Terrace +IBQ- a town of about 13,000 people 1,000 miles north
of Vancouver +IBQ- violated the province's human rights code by rejecting
pleas by the Rainbow B.C. Coalition and the Rainbow Committee of
Terrace to proclaim the pride day.

Mohammed found the "request was refused by the council because [some
councilors] disapproved of what they perceived to be an 'agenda' or
'lifestyle' of the members of the complainant, finding it was 'morally
and socially unacceptable.' The refusal was, in whole, or in part
because of the sexual orientation of the members of the complainant."

Mohammed writes that the decision was likely to be harmful "to
positive, respectful relations between people of all sexual identities
and desires in Terrace and beyond and to diminish the effectiveness of
any other initiatives Terrace might take to increase tolerance and
reduce hatred in the community."
