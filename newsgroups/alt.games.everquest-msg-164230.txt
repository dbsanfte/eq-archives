He's a Druid.  With DoT stacking he can get a ton of mileage out of
Affliction Efficiency 2 (-25% mana cost for DoTs/Snares/Roots L44 and
lower), Affliction Extension 2 (+20% duration for those same spells),
and Affliction Haste 2 (-33% casting time for any of those spells that
are 2.0sec or longer to cast, a very fast Root or Snare can save you
and/or your group).  The Efficiency + Extension foci improve the hell
out of the mana efficiency of his lower level DoTs, and with the
inherent -100 resist adjust on the swarm-type DoTs plus the miniscule
chance of a fizzle on lower level spells they become very nearly
automatic damage.  Having the option of loading a 1.3sec cast time
Snare is also very nice (Ensnare is too fast to be Hasted, so unless
you are one of those druids who got a Tangling Weeds scroll before
they were made Ranger-only this is the fastest casting snare I know
of for a Druid).
