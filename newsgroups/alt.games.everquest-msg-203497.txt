I've been a HUGE ice fan as long as I can remember.  My preference
is crushed ice.  My perception is that it makes the beverage even
colder than ice cubes.  I like my beverages really cold.

That being said, my refridgerator doesn't have an ice maker, so I
have to settle for ice cubes.  I go through about 4 full trays of
ice cubes every day.  I think my ice cube trays hold 14 or 16 cubes,
so that's 56 or 64 cubes per day.
