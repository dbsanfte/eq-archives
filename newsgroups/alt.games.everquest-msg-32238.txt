Enamelled Black Mace isn't bad, but there's also Blackjacks (7/21) which is
slightly better, I got one for 50pp in trades, and a second for 300pp.

Mithril Staff is a good choice for a 2hb weapon, but for skill increases you
want a fast weapon, I would recommend running and getting the abandoned orc
shovel (forget where it is), or buying a Ketchata Koro Mis, if you can use
it.

Langseax and Crystal Fibers are great if you can't afford better, I found a
Fiber for 42pp on a vendor in Thurgadin once, resold it for about 70pp,
hehe.

Executioner's Axe really isn't that great, it doesn't proc haste until level
30.

Don't buy Walrus Tooths, just ask if you can loot one while you run to
Thurgadin to scavenge armour =P, they're lore, so people hunting Walrus' in
East Wastes usually loot one and let the rest rot.
