	Sell pelts you can't use to vendors and keep hunting.  If you find someone
who will make you a Skinning Knife then skin them down but otherwise don't
fret over it.

	Once patchwork is trivial, SKIP the studded and reinforced armors for now.
Pick up enough Brewing to make Heady Kiolas (trivial around 60, 90-100 will
give you a very high success rate) and go directly to Cured Silk Masks.  These
take only one swatch and one Heady Kiola.

	Make those until they trivial, then do Tailored Quivers to 115.  You can
do Crystalline Silk or Wu's after that; Crystalline Silk trivials lower so
you'll get more product as you go and may skill up a bit faster per silk, but
the actual silks you need to harvest drop only in a few places and only in
quantity one place (Crystal Caverns).  Wu's is harder and more expensive but
you only need regular silk, which you can get by the bucket in many places.

	After Wu's you need to have cultural tailoring to progress higher.
