Sadly youll find that our root is woefully inaqequate in most all of LoY, up
until we get Savage Roots. At that point soloing is quite easy in most LoY
zones. Of course by that point your 64, and soloing opportunities, are a LOT
broader than just LoY :)

Dont give up the fight completely yet though. There are some areas in
Guthank, specifically right at the Dulak zone line, and even better, at the
castle, where Kiting can indeed be done safely, or if you prefer you can
root-n-rot, and have plenty of room to re-root, after the absurdly short
root breaks.  Id suggest taking a look at the castle. The steps leading up
to the entrance have a number of mobs ( 6 I believe ) that can be single
pulled without even needing Harmony. Also there are clusters of mushrooms
that can be single pulled via Harmony, and taken to a nice empy place devoid
of spawns.

Give it a look, and I think youll be happy with what you see :)
