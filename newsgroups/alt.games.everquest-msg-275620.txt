And is all the same old nonsense:

"Games, video, computer, online games, PlayStations, etc can be used as 
entertainment and stress relief by many."

True enough.  Just like any other form of entertainment.



"For shut-ins, it is a great tool that can offer hours of enjoyment, and 
interaction with the outside world."

Yup.  Also true.



"They no longer have the "choice" to play, but are driven to play."

I think it's debatable, scientifically speaking, whether such people 
have become 'addicted' to the game - physiologically speaking - or 
whether they just don't have the self-discipline to keep things in 
perspective and control their lives.  In the latter case, which let's 
face it is far more likely, it's not the GAME that's at fault.  In the 
former case, I'd be intrigued to see the research.



"They no longer bathe, clean house, interact with family and friends, or 
go outside."

This must be what we refer to as a 'worst-case scenario'.  I've seen 
some bloody obsessive EQ players in my time, and now EQ2 as well - but I 
ain't EVER seen anyone who's too obsessed to have a bath or interact 
with family.  (I wun't comment on cleaning house cos mine's a tip - but 
that's cos I'm bloody lazy and nothing to do with computers.)



"They stop eating properly and do not get enough sleep. They barely 
leave this new fantasy life, to do anything else. I do not believe all 
online games are inherently bad or evil."

Crap.  "I do not believe they're all evil", spouts the woman who's spent 
the last three sentences making exaggerated claims in the hope of 
getting that exact message across.



"But I do know, however, that some of the game manufacturers do require 
their game developers to have degrees in psychology to make them even 
more addictive."

Yeah?  You mean like those people who spend their lives trying to work 
out how to manipulate people's desires...  Damn, what're they called...  
Oh, yeah: "advertisers"?  Oooo, evil monstrosities, they are...  Where's 
the evidence for this requirement for psychology degrees?  Moreover, 
where's the evidence for this claim as to why they're required?



"I set up Online Gamers Anonymous as a self-help 12-step programme"

Oh, aye, there's nothing quite like a 12-step programme, is there?  I do 
love a good self-help course, nothing like it.  Anyone can get in on the 
old self-help thing - it's a godsend to those who believe they've got 
themselves a little old crusade to fight...  A terrible evil to 
confront...  And it doesn't require the leader, strangely, to list the 
qualifications that entitle her to set herself up as a 'counsellor' on 
any damn thing.



<< My son, Shawn, committed suicide as a direct result of being addicted 
to the EverQuest game. >>

Yeah?  Tragic and so on, no doubt.  But let's see the evidence, again, 
shall we?  What was the result of the inquest?  Or perhaps you'd prefer 
that we just take your claim at face value and blindly accept every word 
you utter while you're supposedly not claiming that all games are evil.



<< It gives gamers hope that they can do this and helps them realize 
they aren't alone in their struggle. >>

If there're people who're 'addicted' to EQ, or any other game, to this 
extent then, again, the game certainly isn't the problem.

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
