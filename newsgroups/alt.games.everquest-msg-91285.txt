> Jade Reaver is easy to get to?  Dunno about that.

Piece of cake with a single group level average of about 54.

Piece of cake with 2 groups level 50+ if you have experience doing it.

Yesterday we started with like 4 groups (lots of guildies finally got high
enough to go, so we let them) and after the first 4 downstairs we lost 3 to
falling off the ramp going up to the last one and by the start of the third
sweep we had 8 characters (7 people, I was playing my enchanter and wizzie).
Wizzie decided to go swimming (they really should put a warning about
following around water when you do a /follow ;) ) so he was out.

We had: 59 war, 60 dru, 56 enc, 56 cle, 52 mnk, 55 mnk, 44 wiz (my alt) and
I think 52? rogue.

The room respawned while we were fighting a black reaver (3 or 4 spawns?)
and I had to keep them asleep.  No biggie, while they did a triple BR spawn.

The biggest challenge for the reavers is to make sure that everyone knows to
leave Rak Ashiir the hell alone.  Thankfully CR is a piece of cake in that
zone, but it's still inconvenient.

I'm NOT in an uberguild...nothing close, we just have a lot of experience
doing CoM for various & sundry druids & rangers.  It IS a pain in the ass
though and with 14 spawns the bastards didn't drop even one reaver.  If
that's what you meant about not being easy to get, I'll agree with that, but
it's no more of a pain than the corrupted cyclops.
