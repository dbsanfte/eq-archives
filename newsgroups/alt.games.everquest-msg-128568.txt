I started playing EQ just over a year ago.  By that time, the hybrid
experience penalty had been removed.  Furthermore, I read that all
classes of a given race need the same fixed experience points to move
through a given level (so to speak, I realize there would be
multipliers attached to the outdated slower classes to compensate).
But now 2 members of my guild state that rogues level faster.  I am a
high elf cleric and often group with a barbarian rogue guildie, and we
are the same level (58).  It seems he will get half a yellow of
experience to my one and a half blue.  We both may be a bit off in our
estimatations, but still it seems there is a difference.  I was
surprised because I thought he would get less experience since
barbarians supposedly have a slight penalty.  

Then a level 60 rogue commented to a level 60 high elf mage that he
made a yellow alt experience, while the mage had made 3 blues.  The
mage wondered if the rogue was getting roguely bonuses to alt
experience.  

Some confusion on this matter can be found in posts made after the
hybrid change.  People seem to think warriors and rogues level fast.
So, would a halfling rogue outlevel his halfling cleric partner,
assuming all other conditions are equal?
