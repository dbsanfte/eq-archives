Here's the bad news -- monks (unless twinked with a good weapon) are in 
the dumps until about level 30ish. They deal mediocre damage, and they 
can't take much of it :( Sorry

Monks do not run any faster than other classes

They can't taunt. At later levels their damage becomes a big taunting 
factor though, but not that early

At level 17 you get feign death. It means you can decide whether to take 
those 15 reds to your group, or just start the pull from scratch. You 
can also FD split mobs, and bring singles to your party

>   Or should I just go back to playing my wizzard? 

If it was up to me, that class would either not exist, or be totally 
different from what it is now. As it stands now, wizards don't have much 
to offer to their groups until after level 50. However, anyone playing 
one for RPing reasons, or just because they like it, deserve some 
respect at least for that.
I would not recommend playing a wizard unless you fall under the 
previous two categories

> (Same thing there...
> what does the wizzy do in a 6-8 lvl group?)

Same thing they always do -- nuke, die occasionally. Root-park if 
indoors
