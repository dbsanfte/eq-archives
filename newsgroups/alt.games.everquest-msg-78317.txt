Untrue. I know this is how verant proposed it and I know that it works most
of the time, but there are several levels (Mostly lower ones) where light
blue = no XP. I noticed at 5th I think that light blue mobs gave me no xp.
At 6th this was fixed, but at 8th it happened again. I don't mean just once
either, I mean 10 out of 10 times a light blue mob didn't give XP.

The first time I didn't get xp from a light blue I thought. that's
strange... I got looting rights, so I KNOW I got the kill, but no xp. Second
time, same thing, third, figured out what was going on. Killed a few more
light blues of different types to make sure it wasn't just the one type of
mob and then I reported this as a bug.
