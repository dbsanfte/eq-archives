Of course they targeted it to existing players...IT'S AN EXPANSION, not a 
stand-alone.  If they were REALLY hoping to get new subsccribers with it, 
they would have shipped it WITH classic/trilogy/gold, not alone.

The idea (mostly opinion, maybe from a press release or something) behind 
making it download only, then changing to ship SOME to brick-and-mortar 
stores was based on the download time/bandwidth use, and the hassle that 
less-than-broadband users would face.

Of course, I could be mistaken on that, as I don't work for them or have 
inside knowledge.  Maybe I'm just talking out my ass.

Oh, and I've only been playing since July of last year....ONE account.
