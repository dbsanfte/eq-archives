Used to be.  I used up all my slots on TM and then decided to make a 
rogue on another server and chose E Marr because Cel was there and I 
know her from another NG (of course she's never around to wave to me or 
twink me like she's supposed to be ;)).  After I left EQ for awhile, I 
came back and found out all my friends had left too (it's true - the 
only reason to play is because I'm there!) and the frustrations I'd had 
with my main (shaman) still existed.  I was about to give up again until 
I remembered I had that rogue and went and levelled him up a bit.  Now 
I'm quite happy with EQ again.  No pets to get in the way of pulling 
*back* to the group.  No mana to worry about.  No expensive spells or 
spell components.

Ahhhhh.

Ryou
(much happier now that it's "get some damage in while someone else takes 
the hits")
