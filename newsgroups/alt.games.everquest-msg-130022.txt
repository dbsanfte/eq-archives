I agree with that - arguments from authority is wrong - what
is relevant is whether AI can or cannot provide the factual
backup claimed by the people who have referenced it.

Also, tis true that most of the US human rights abuse cases
that are taken up by AI are about its application of the death
penalty - and if you take the view that the death penalty
is *not* "cruel and unusual punishment" in every case, you
are not going to agree with AI about many of these cases.

I can't remember what human rights abuses have been
leveled against my own country - I think there was something
about the conditions of detaining asylum seekers.

However, Amnesty does strive for objectivity, in that it does
not allow people to work on human rights cases that
happen in their own country.
