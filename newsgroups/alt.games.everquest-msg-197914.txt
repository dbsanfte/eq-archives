Oh I fully respect that as your opinion.  I was just presenting my 
opposing opinion.  Knowing that I have a relatively bad ping means 
something to me, as does knowing that my outbound packets are fine but 
inbound are not and the data rate as I described in response to an 
earlier post is very important as well.... to me.  This is not to say 
that it matters to you, just that it matters to me and I would hate to 
see it replaced with something less useful.  Perhaps they could create a 
feature that lets you choose a simple red/yellow/green icon while I can 
still see the detailed information, but to remove the details based on 
your opinion would be a loss for those of my opinion, in my opinion.
