Curious, I don't remember a poll to the posters of the newsgroup to
approve a faq... Nor do I recall you offhand. A google search shows a
whopping posting history of 25 posts, starting in February... There's
mention of Taras "transferring" the FAQ to you, but I don't seem to
recall him making any effort to get a FAQ "approved", either. I have
seen him post the FAQ a couple times in the past, but there's been no
real objection mainly because there's nothing unreasonable in it.
Stil, something being billed as the "official" FAQ for the group
shouldn't be arbitrarily "appointed" by one or two people.

The line quoted is one that definately doesn't apply to age. Off-topic
tends to be accepted here, so long as it doesn't get totally out of
hand. Hell, only newsgroups I've ever seen that stay on topic all the
time are practically dead because of it. ><
