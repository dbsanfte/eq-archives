He who is without sin shall throw the first stone..

Think that covers the "You should read the EULA part".

Just sell your char, send him the CD's with original keys on em and he can
enjoy the game. Be sure to cancel your supscription so he won't be playing
of your CC. Once your supscription ends he will be able to activate the
account using his own CC information.

That's about it.
