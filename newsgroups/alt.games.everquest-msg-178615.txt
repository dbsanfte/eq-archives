    It was a bad example to use, changing something that had fine detail
when untinted. They would have been better off using a robe as an example,
since most robe models don't lose fine detail when tinted.

    It looks about how I expected it would look. It's too bad, in a way.
We'll be losing a lot of the distinctiveness of the various types of armour.
But I'm horribly outvoted on this one, I imagine.
