You show more patience than I would. With a group that disfunctional
at that level, I don't hesitate to find a reason to bail. They should
all know better by now, and at the *very* least, answer your questions
regarding who the MA is. I don't wait around for them to find a
replacement. I don't temper my decision to leave with the fact that
others may also be leaving (they probably are as frustrated as I am).
If the group seems to be a nice bunch but simply lacking in effort, I
make up an excuse. Maybe they are approaching it a bit more casually
than I would like. That's ok. If they just seem disinterested - or
worse, ebayed - I'll let them know why I'm leaving straight up.

Rumble <--- zero patience for slackers in a group
