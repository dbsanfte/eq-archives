You only get 3 blues from a hard LDoN?  Ouch.  I was usually getting at
least 10% (2.5) and sometimes 16% on regular.  I guess I got spoiled by
being one of the two lowest level members in the group.  My normal group
doesn't do hards.  We tried one, but the Pally couldn't pacify, we quickly
ran into the Mother of All Pulls and wiped.  Tried again and wiped.  When we
got singles, my impression was that that we needed some serious gear
upgrades to make it work.  I have to get some flowing thought items, I just
couldn't keep up with malising and two nukes per mob.  I wish SOE would
create an intermediate level.  Normal is a bit too easy, hard looks to be
too difficult.

You could try the courtyard at Veksar solo or with the Shammy.  I don't know
how the xp compares, maybe 1% every two or three kills solo.

I got spoiled by being able to do solo camps like Golras, Yetis, and
Plaguebone Skellies.  Those camps moved the xp bar along nicely even if they
were somewhat boring and not in the spirit of adventuring.  In the 50's,
solo camps became much, much slower.  Dryads, Gnolls, Katta Guards - barf!
