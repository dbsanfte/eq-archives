	Not if it's really skill based and not just knowing a secret word
or exactly where to stand...  For instance, I had an LDON mission where
a runner or gater "split" the group so that I had to run back and forth
to get the tank and off tank in range for heals.  I had to remember the 
turns back to each group, not run ALL the way to each group because I 
wouldn't get back to the other in time, and remember the "spurious interrupt"
problem (stop and spin in place a hair so EQ knows I'm standing still).

	I'm thinking of situations that would require someone to really
know how to play a class, so that even knowing the solution won't help if
you don't know the _exact_ range of a heal for instance.  Also, sometimes
even knowing the tactic doesn't help; raids regularly wipe even though
every step is known in advance.

	Yes, smarter mobs!  Why don't mobs at least melee casters and cast
on melees like any player would?  Among other things...
