Just wanted to add this one observation:  Lance didn't mention that there's
a level limit on the level 5 stun.  It won't work at all on mobs level 55
and above.  So yes, it will be a useful tool for you for a while, but not
forever.

The rest of Lance's essay was spot-on and should be something all clerics
read.
