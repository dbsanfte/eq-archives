Haha, I do not work for edimensional but i find it unfair that they
would get such a trashing when I'm sure that there's more to the story
than that.  i found them extremely pleasant to deal with and i felt it
only right to post the other side of the coin and let people draw
their own conclusions.  if you look through their reviews and posts
elsewhere, you'd see how common it is for people to post about the
good level of service they received. why must it alwaysfor someone to
post a long negative, but anytime someone posts a positive they get
reprimanded?  It's like all people want to hear is bad, and i get
enough of that watching the local news.
