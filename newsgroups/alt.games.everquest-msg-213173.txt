That was my first thought when I heard this.  How hard would it be to make a
couple of pop-outs on each side that automatically vent some air once it
gets over 120 or so?  Some kind of little fan that blows some air in?  A
weight sensor that honks the horn if there is weight in the child seat and
the key is turned off for more than 5 minutes?
