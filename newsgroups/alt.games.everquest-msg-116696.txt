}My enchanter gave up melee (and soloing) at 16, tho I did work at defense a
}bit... when I could get a friend to heal me while i was getting clobbered.
}Extra defense is always good.

My chanter just got his Hand-to-Hand up to 57 night before last in a Crypt 
group in Seb.  Had to work on something after I capped all  the other 
melee skills...

Sure, it's silly.  Sure, I get a lot of ribbing about how chanters can't 
tank.  But so what?  Nobody died, we were still ahead of spawn, and all 
the adds got mezzed.

So, if you wanna work on combat skills, you go right ahead.  You don't 
really -need- to after about level 16 in a group, but it may save your 
butt soloing some day when you're out of mana and just need to do 12 more 
points of damage to he horrible beastie before it'll flee.

Personally, I love being bound in EC so when I die on the uber raid I can 
take out my frustrations beating orc pawns to death with my bare hands. :)
