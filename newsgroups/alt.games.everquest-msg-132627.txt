Lightning Blast hits up to 4 targets.  Upheaval hits up to... hmm, most
I've personally seen would be 52.  Of course getting 52 mobs to
stand right on top of you while you PB nuke em to death takes a little
planning if you want to live... but its one of the most efficient strategies
in the game

A druid friend and I do a partner PBAOE thing with it, killing 12 mobs in
the mana it would normally take us to kill 9... thats her killing 4, then
4 again, to go OOM, and of course me killing 1 and also going OOM.
12 seems to be about our safe limit, though, as she takes a dreadful
beating even with full cleric buffs when its her turn to do the AOEs.

It just occured to me, if we did this near a zone line, she could zone to
wash off aggro and then I could hate kite em past her and -maybe- keep
aggro when she nukes.  That would remove this pesky "around 12" limit...
Alternately I could just rez her after.
