Yes I assumed by player base they meant active accounts. I wouldn't call an
inactive account a player.
But yes is it active accounts only. All accounts. The total database. The
average active player base this month, this fiscal year or year to date etc.
I'd like to see some percentage data based on various points in time since
launch just to see the trends.

Regardless, there is a lot of content for players solo that are 50ish to see
yet.
Expansions need to cater to those that have exhausted content.
The high level soloists would be the ones having a harder time getting new
places to see.
Hopefully OoW works well for them .

My point isn't arguing that xyz expansion is good or bad but that even
though the bulk of your player base may be midlevel that's not who you need
to make expansions for as long as there is lots of content for them.
