Where did I mention high end uber mobs?
What do you think happens against say a rat in DN when a 1300AC
warrior triggers defensive?  Hint:  Cleric can go make a sandwich and
make it back in time to cast complete heal on the warrior.

If that isn't definition of "better" tanking, please explain what is.

Yep.
Usually because the cleric fired the heal too soon before a warrior
managed to build up aggro.  *THAT* is a problem against the uber mobs,
not against exp grind mobs.  Which I thought you were limiting this
discussion to.

How about at 55?
Last I checked level 5 lasted all of 20 mins.

The other factors are NOT limited to just SKs.  While SKs may have
spells, they don't have *10* levels worth of taunt skill and zero dual
weild.

Or did the fact that dual weidling low delay weapons regardless of the
actual amount of damage generates a fuckload more aggro than swinging
a hard hitting slow as fuck 2Her?

Or that certain mobs are more sensitive to proximity for their aggro
than any other factor?

Slightly more yeah right.
Puller brings four mobs, I trigger defensive, I start tagging each mob
to generate aggro.  After about 30 seconds of tagging mobs, I'm at 80%
health.  An SK 2 levels higher attempts the same thing, he's at 30%
health--did I mention said SK was in full Thurg armor?  I was in
cobalt BP and some stupid dayglow banana yellow legs which I really
need to replace. He needs a CH cast about 2 seconds ago.  I can hold
the stupid mobs for another 90 seconds before the cleric has to even
think about starting a CH.

You do realize that's a pretty good form of crowd control when you
don't have an enchanter, right?
