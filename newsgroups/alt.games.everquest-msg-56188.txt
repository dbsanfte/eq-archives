Well I know everyone is correct in saying Large races have more HP's
etc.  I was trying to bring up 2 points.  EQ's producers say Warriors
have far more hitpoints than Knights.  This needs to be rephrased,
Warriors have more HP's per STA than Knights.  Also SK's say they
don't have the HP's to tank the uber mobs.  This is incorrect,
although a warrior may be a better uber mob tank, there are times when
a SK will have more HP's than a warrior, along with all the SK spells
and Harm Touch and SLAM.
