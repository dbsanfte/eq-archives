Pretty much all of it. "Some" accounts number in the hundreds, they
say. We don't know if ALL the exploits have been "smashed" yet, but
many of them have been. They've asked us to pass on any and all info
we find on exploits, and not to assume they already know since they'd
rather have 100 reports of an exploit than 0.
