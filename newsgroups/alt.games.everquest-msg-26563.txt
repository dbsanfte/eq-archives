There was an exceptionally beautiful girl in my high school class who was
thought by most to be a complete slut.  She said she was a virgin, saving
herself for marriage.  I only had her word on it, but I believed her.  Would
it have made her a bad person if she had spread for every bozo who told her
she was pretty?  Would it have made her a bad person if she had denied the
bozos because she was saving herself for someone really special?

As said in The Breakfast Club, "If you say you did it, you're a slut.  If
you say you didn't, you're a prude.  It's a trap."  There's such a huge
neurosis in society about sex that even possessing the proper set of organs
is probably considered a character flaw.
