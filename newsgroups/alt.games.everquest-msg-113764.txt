Again, isn't the assumption there that the rogue will remain behind
the mob? That's pretty difficult if the rogue is doing more damage,
isn't it? Also, assuming that the rogue's DPS would be greater - "...a
rogue will eat a monk's lunch in terms of DPS." - would the difference
really be that significant? Would I expect something in the
neighborhood of a 25% to 30% advantage? That would surely be eating my
lunch as a monk, whereas 5% to 10% would be more like taking a Tic-Tac
without asking.  :)

As a reminder, I don't know. That's why I'm asking, so flames off
please.
