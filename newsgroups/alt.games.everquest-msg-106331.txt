Snip

That whole article can be summed up as "When people with addictive
personalities get addicted to video games, like crack." I don't know
why everyone acts like this is such a big deal, people ruin their
marriage by being addicted to infidelity too. Anything can be an
addiction.

I guess I'm lucky, I have a non addictive personality whether it be
booze, food or video games.

If anyone knows they are prone to succumbing to addiction, yeah, they
should stay the hell away from mmorpgs. I've sure never seen a TV set
with an addiction warning on it but some people spend 25 hours more a
week watching it at the exclusion of other activities.
