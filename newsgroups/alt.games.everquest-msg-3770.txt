I've been thinking one nice thing would be some way to pick up names
from your message window.  In other words, instead of having to type
a name, you can double click or right click or whatever the name out
of the message window.  Or perhaps have a "recent names" list that
shows you the last 20 names that have shown up in the message window,
and you can pick out of that.  

There are times when I would help someone, but I try to do a tell to
them 3 or 4 times and keep failing, and finally give up.
