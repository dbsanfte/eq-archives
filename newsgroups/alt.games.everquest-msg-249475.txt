I've been attacked at level 57 and whilst i could shrug off the mobs, all it
takes is a failed fear resist to make you run into a nasty group. I
recommend daytime or invis to undead (what level do pallies get that?). The
day night cycle is pretty short in the end.

Mind you, when you zone in, be ready to deal with the large number of orcs
that may be waiting for you...

That said, i love highkeep. Unfortunately I'm not alone and it can get a bit
bitchy there sometimes.
