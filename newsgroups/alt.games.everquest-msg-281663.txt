OK, so I've already posted to the official tech support EQ boards, I'm
more curious if anyone else has seen any bizzar issues like this since
the Oct 27 patch.

My wife's characters have all become human males. But they still have
their race/gender appropriate clothing graphics. So her female iksar
monk with the iksar horned skull helmet looks like a human male wearing
female iksar leather and the iksar horned skull helmet, her female
wood-elf druid looks like a human male with an eye patch wearing a
female wood-elf robe, and so on. Really bizzar and it would be amusing
except that one of her characters has also been renamed to a square
(think ISO8859-1 non-printable character character), shows up as level
5 (way below what it should be) and cannot be logged in to. The
computer being logged in to doesn't matter; we've tried four different
systems. My character select screen looks good, our friends character
select screens, on the same computers, all look fine, it's just hers.

Xiphos - My guess is somehow her character roster has become corrupted
on the server side.
