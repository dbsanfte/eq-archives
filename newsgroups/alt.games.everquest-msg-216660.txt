Trust me, the fuckwit ain't Jazz. Jazz hasn't read this group in ages. 
He currently doesn't even have EQ installed on his computer. If it 
weren'the for the fact that an old friend of ours emailed him to show 
him the birfday greetings he received on his old guild board, he 
wouldn't have thought of this game for months.

Jazz & I have deleted SWG and cancelled our accounts. That game is truly 
broken and fucked up beyond repair.

I keep saying I'm going to play EQ again, and Jazz babbles sometimes 
about waiting for EQ2  to come out. But I think at the moment, we're 
enjoying the real life thing, and actually LOOKING at each other and 
SPEAKING instead of just typing back and forth.

I did log on last week. Maybe I'll log on this week. Who knows. I'd like 
to see Tarre hit 65. But there's a lot of other shit around the house 
I'd like to do too.
