    Welcome to my world. :) Before yesterday's patch, I got this at least
once a day, sometimes 3-4 times a day. The popup window basically says 'EQ
has determined that your client may have crashed...yadda yadda...would you
like to send this information to EQ so we can determine what may have caused
it?' (paraphrased...after so many times, you basically stop reading it and
just hit enter) Yesterday evening, when I got on, I played for a few hours,
then set up shop in the bazaar...and woke up this morning still logged in.
What a surprise! I then went guard-hunting in Oggok, hunted for about half
an hour before getting ready for work, camped out...and when it hit the
character selection screen, yep, you guessed it, got the 'crashed' popup and
back to desktop. Which was fine, since I'd already camped out. :)

    I doubt that helped, but just wanted to let ya know that yes, some
people get this on a regular basis and learn to live with it. :)
