OK, but point is that shamans are better at the overall goal of keeping the
hitpoints up high.  At level 29 I finally got my upgrade in the slow line of
spells, and I got my Quickness.  I often partner with a rogue, and using
that combination of spells makes an awesome difference in the amount of
damage I have to heal.  Clerics are always better as pure healers, no
question, starting at level 1.
