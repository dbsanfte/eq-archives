I don't recall having had that happen to me when mob missed every time, but
I can't say that I have paid much attention to that, all I cared about was
whether it was interrupted or no.  My channeling is maxed for my level, or
very close to it, I still have interruptions many many times when I am being
hit.  That would be with my Shaman, casting both fast and slow spells.  I
also often successfully cast while being hit, but I sure can't count on it..
I've only had an interruption problem with my warrior once, attempting to
quaff a SoW potion, only had to try it once while being hit.
