Well, I would have to say that these posts responding to me have been 
exceptionally civil, as are many posts. Many threads start out very 
civil, and continue so for a long time, until about 5 or 6 regulars 
devolve into simians tossing sh!tebombs at each other over fairly stupid 
details. Even those slightly derailed threads have the sh!tebombers 
continue in one strand, and normal discussions continuing on in their 
own strands. I have noticed netscape has the ability to strand out 
threads so i can simply bypass the zoo and read the sensible posts.
