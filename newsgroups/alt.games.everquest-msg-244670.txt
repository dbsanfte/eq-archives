They don't need to create different models, since models are already
shared between adventures of different levels.  However, I think
there's a lot more to vary than level and a few flags - you need to
tune how much damage they do, how many hit points they have, and how
they resist spells in general - none of these are automatically scaled
by level, I think.  OTOH, adventures don't have all mobs equally hard,
I think, at least their level varies, so they could use a mixture of
the higher level normal and lower level hard mobs, perhaps.
