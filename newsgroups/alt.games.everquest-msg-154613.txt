I'm not saying I don't like them. I am saying its wrong for them to have 
an attitude where they think they can do whatever they like to squeeze 
more money out of EQ and in the process ignore what the players want. It 
all comes down to customer satisfaction, some people in this newsgroup 
(not naming any names but looking at Dark Tyger) don't seem to 
understand that.
