T> Today I was fighting spectres in Oasis and my levitation suddenly went off.
T> I fell into the water and sunk down to the aqua goblins. Suddenly they
T> started to chain cast me and my health was falling so fast.
T>
T> Suddenly then I appeared in the ocean of tears and a GM said to me they were
T> watching my progress on the spectres and thought I was brave and he was the
T> one that saved my life and that he wanted me to add him to my friend list.
T> When I told him that he was a camp stealer and stole my kills he got mad and
T> started to swear at me. I didn't turn my log on in time so I couldn't record
T> it.
T>
T> After this I was teleported to another zone or something loaded and I saw a
T> dragon called Kerafyrm who asked me what I was doing in his lands and unless
T> I zone right away he would kill me. I ran so fast out of there because he
T> was starting to cast spells. I zoned and ended up in a magical mystical zone
T> with a bunch of bright flashing lights and flying unicorns. The GM showed up
T> again and asked me what the hell I was doing here and how I found out how to
T> enter this secret zone. I told him Kerafyrm rushed me out of his temple door
T> and I ended up there.
T>
T> The GM was SOOOO mad that he just slayed me and I ended back up at my bind
T> point Freeport. I don't know how the hell I can get my gear back, if anyone
T> wants to help me or tell me how to get back to the secret magic land it
T> would be awesome.
T>
T> Thanks!!
