I've handed a guildie 100k or so to transfer to my alt... so lack of trust
isn't the sole deciding factor in letting somebody else play me

Each to their own though... a guildie said in a discusion a lil while ago,
"Im really anti cheating.. I wont ever use EQW"  but he has given his
password out to various guildies..

I guess my comment would be "Im really anti cheating.. i wont ever let
people log on me".. but yeah, i have no problems with EQW

People like DT think EQW is the work of the devil, used to wreak havoc in EQ
and gets people banned.... I see it as a utility that lets me alt+tab in and
out of the game, and work/do something else as im camping..

Sharing accounts has caused more bannings and havoc than EQW ever will
(which im sure stands at zero and zero for eqw)

For 4 years in my last game i wouldn't share my acct.. even when they
announced the game was being discontinued I didn't...

I went away on vacation 2 days before the game was turned off for good, and
got one of my accounts, got the character renamed, and finally gave it to a
friend.  (it was the highest level, but not my most well known character)

My main account - where everybody knew me as the guild leader of xxxxx etc -
that was never shared period
