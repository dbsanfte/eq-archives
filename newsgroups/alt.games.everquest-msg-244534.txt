They need code to check what level you end up at when you die, and if
the code for this is the same as the code to check what level you end
up at when you gain exp, it'll probably say "level 50", because it
checked for expansions, and then you get dumped to 50.  Though if it
was that simple you should regain your level as soon as the game
realises you have the expansion and you gain some XP.

This seems more than a little bizarre, since you can't normally lose
them when dying, and the same goes for flags, but perhaps that code is
there for testing so they can temporarily give someone AAs/flags
without flagging them for the necessary expansion and have them go
away.  Might be useful on the test server or beta servers.
