True, but I don't think this was a very good test. IIRC, the EQ client and 
server don't have to alway agree on exactly where you are. So the other 
guy would have seen him where the server thought he was. Here is a 
question though, if the server thinks you are located in the middle of a 
zone and the client suddenly tells the server that you just zoned, what 
happens? (Other than being banned when Verant review the server logs. ;-)
