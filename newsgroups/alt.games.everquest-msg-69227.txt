I've been thinking the same thing. You don't have to be colourblind for the 
new textures to be an affront to your senses. It seems as if they have 
added detail for the sake of detail to prove that the textures are higher 
resolution. Whereas before you had the grass on a sweeping plain (Karana, 
say) show up as fairly uniform green, now they've added in little plants, 
patches of bare earth and so on, and because its a repeating texture these 
show up over and over to create a mottled, contrasty effect. Norrath looks 
horribly garish now, everything that is supposed to be fairly plain 
background scenery (blank stone walls, sand, etc) is now sporting high-
contrast patterns which vie for attention alongside the detailed things you 
want to stand out (character and mob models etc). I'm hoping that if I 
reduce texture detail it will just use the old textures, not lower-res 
versions of the new textures.
