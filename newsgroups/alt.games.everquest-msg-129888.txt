I lost track of him just before things got so big in the news.  I would have
asked a lot more if I'd known how bad it would get.
His parents could not be persuaded to move away from their homeland and
relatives.  He was very worried for them.  I have a vague memory of him
saying something about being sent to live in another Arab country for
school, because of the situation in Palestine.  I know that he wanted to
live in Palestine, but there was a problem with his wife moving there.
I don't think that Palestinians are any worse than Jews.  Or any better.  I
grew up in a place with a significant amount of Jews that fit some of the
stereotypes.  I've moved around and traveled way more than most and have had
a number of close friends who were Jewish since.  I don't think that I have
any racist feelings now.
I do tend to side with the underdogs in most cases, and I have learned that
there are almost no people who do things, that they don't have some rational
( to themselves ) reason for doing.  There are no absolute rights and
wrongs, only ways of seeing a thing.  If you can't understand all the ways,
then you don't fully understand the problem.  Not that anyone can.  If there
is a god, I'm sure that he can, and that explains why god can love all his
creatures.  Truth and love are infinite, people aren't.
