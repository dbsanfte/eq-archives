So how are people getting to PoK?  Can't be via Druids, as there
aren't enough of them unless they're working taxi service 24/7.

Or are you intending that the only methods for getting to Luclin and
PoK are the Druids?  I.e., you're intending to bottleneck 80% of the
high-end content (I think GoD counts as about 20, doesn't it?) through
the one class that can 'port to those areas.

Given that the Bazaar (by your rules) is no longer connected to PoK
*or* to the original continents, I think you're going to... annoy a
few traders.

Leave /loc in, take perfect Sense Heading out.  You'd be amazed how
many people get lost even when /loc can tell them *exactly* where they
are and the other person can tell them *exactly* where they're
supposed to get to.

Yes.

Yes.

Chic.



Wanna hear a joke?  Know how my Dwarven Paladin got from one place to
another?  He ran.  He took boats.  He slogged along.  When Kunark came
out, I got there via boat, not via Druid.  When Velious came out, I
got there via raft and boat and foot leather.  When I hunted in GD and
Eastern Wastes, I ran there and got a bind.  When I left, I ran to the
boat in Iceclad and got a bind when I hit Freeport.  When Luclin came
out, I started using the Spires but, if I missed the Spire, I'd simply
start running for wherever I was going.  And half the time I didn't
bother waiting anyway.  In 5 years of playing, I probably got 'ported
about 10 times, including 'ports from friends.

You used to be able to fish on the boats, you know?  Very convenient.
All it took was a Lev or a DMF just before it left.

It wasn't until PoK came out that I stopped using the boats.
