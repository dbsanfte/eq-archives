Well, for starters, they can fight "smart" with what they have.
I mean, Ca-mon now, how smart is it to blow your wad in a one-time
fashion like "sucide" such that they ensure that they can not do 
it again, *or* be around to see any (remote) chances of a victory?

Contrast *that* with some of the things the army-less VC did during
Viet Nam and you may start to SEE that these people have even *YOU*
fooled about their seemingly common goal.  These people are simply
manical, "heavens gate" type people, nothing less, nothing more.

Hell, even CAVE MAN fought smarter that that!  There are "booby traps"
they can make, spears, darts, arrows, TONS of crafty shit to do.
