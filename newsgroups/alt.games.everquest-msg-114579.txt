i am the main treasurer for my guild's bank what it consist's of mainly is
gear and items that drop from raid's  and platinum gained from raids  and
old gear that players wish to donate to the guild so younger characters can
buy at a reduced price of what it would cost in EC  or gfay

and what doesnt get sold to guildies gets sold  to other players outside the
guild  for a profit to help pay  for gems that are needed when raiding
certain places, coffins when bodies need to be summoned  and other costly
things

there are other things associated with a guilds bank but that is mainly it
if it made any sense :)
