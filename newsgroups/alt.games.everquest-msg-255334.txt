Yes I do plan on joining a raiding guild once I reach 65.  Any suggestions on 
what I could carry now for primary and secondar slots that aren't too 
expensive?  Currently I have a Smoldering Brand which I only got 2 work on 
some 1H Blunt when I'm bored and an opal encrusted stein in the offhand.  Heck 
sometimes I run around with a stien in each hand.
