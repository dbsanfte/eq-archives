That "old" was only about a year ago.

It hasn't since the pet is pretty useless.  If something is hitting the
cleric, the cleric should just take it and not hit back so the chanter can
mez the mob.  As for Battle Clerics, that's not what groups want you for.
If you want to play a Battle Cleric, play a pally.

Ugh.  Here we go again.  Someone that doesn't read the post.

Where did I say I wanted it for free?  How can you read "The expansions
should have been part of what you pay the monthly subscription for." and
come to that conclusion?

You assume I'm not advocating an increase in the subscription price.  But
instead of asking that question, you make more assumptions that I'm not
aware of the reality of the MMORPG economics.  To say nothing about having
been part of three attempts to bring about MMORPGs.

I just feel it is an unwise business practice.  I've known a lot of people
that are not playing EQ when they find out how much it would cost to get all
the expansions.

EQ wasn't the MMORPG that started off the MMORPG flood that is continuing to
this date.  I think that honor goes to Ultima Online, if not a previous one.
And if they didn't have you pay for all the expansions and simply charged a
bit more for the monthly expansion, it is my opinion that EQ would likely be
more successful thus more of your driving force behind MMORPGs.
