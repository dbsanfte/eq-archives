While I can't give you such a chart (as useful as that would be), here's how
I'd find out......

Make a "mirror" character on a server you don't play on.  Run him up to
Neriak, down to Ogguk, etc, and see.

With the new rules of characters under level 10 respawning with all their
equipment intact, you really aren't risking much anymore by trying it that
way, except for the time it takes to actually do it.
