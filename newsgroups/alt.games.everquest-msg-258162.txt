I was playing around with my eqclient.ini file the other day before I
saw this post, and one of the first settings was something like
EQGfxDLL= (or something similar).  Basically it's the setting that holds
the graphics DLL filename.  Mine had the DX7 dll filename there.  I
haven't had a chance to mess around with this, but I'm curious.  In your
old and new .ini files, what was that setting's value, if you can find it?
