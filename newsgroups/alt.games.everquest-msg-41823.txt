   I played for a very short while on Tuesday, but I was too 
depressed to get into it.  There was no having any fun that 
day.  But for the short time I was there, Drinal was unually 
quiet.  There very few auctions, shouts, or ooc.  I got curious
and checked in the LoIO, Gfay, and Ecomms.  The zone populations
were down, but not barren.  And yet...the silence was almost 
eerie.
    Played for a longer time yesterday, mostly in S.Karana.  No
mention at ALL of the attack.
