Like the subject says...

"... survive by itself for half an hour..." I know. Reading for
comprehension is such a burden.

The space bar is that long thing under your hand. That long bar you
never use.

Try it. Especially after commas and periods. You'll like the smooth
resiliency and aerobic benefit.

That way you get good exercise and don't have to type with one hand.
