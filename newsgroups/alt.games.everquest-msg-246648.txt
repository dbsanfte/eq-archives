Whats to dispute?
That shamans are the best heal+slow class?

That a cleric+shaman is enough healing for all 3 ikkinz trials?
Well, I've been there, done that. Guildies have done the same (with 2
different shamans, 1 with quarm shield and 1 without).
Im sure the group was higher gear/mana than the one you tried with, but
we've been farming potime for quite some time now. It comes down to mana
pool (which comes with gear), not spells or 5 years of leetness

I don't need to read forums where people tell me they can't do it, because I
personally know they CAN do it. I've completed every trial with a shaman in
my groups. Groups that guildies or i beat the ikkinz trial with-
Monk, Warrior, Wizard, Shaman, Cleric, Enchanter (Ikkinz1)
Monk, Warrior, Wizard, Shaman, Cleric, Paladin (Ikkinz2)
Monk, Warrior, Shadowknight, Shaman, Enchanter, Cleric (Ikkinz3)

Groups 1 and 3 only had a cleric+shaman as healage.. group2 had a pal too,
but he was more for backup tanking than a required healer

Their GoD spells aren't very good?
The new slow, a better insta heal, and a better heal over time is pretty
ownage spells, what better could a shaman of asked for? (new canni still to
come)
