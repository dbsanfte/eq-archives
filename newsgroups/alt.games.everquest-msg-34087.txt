The short, though probably unsatisfactory, answer to your specific
example is, IMO, "we have no way of knowing".  Since you don't get a
numerical faction change message like you do with trade skills, (e.g.
"your faction with Jaged Pine Treefolk got better! (174)") all you know
is that it's going up.
  It would be nice to think that if, for example, you were trying to
increase your Knights of Truth faction, that you would get a bump of one
point for an orc pawn, but say, three for an orc centururian. However,
given the extra complexity of coding that would be involved, I rather
doubt it. I suspect that you'll get the same base change (probably one)
for all the "smaller" critters.
  Having said that, there *are* different creatures that give
significantly larger boosts. In my example above, I spent literally
hours killing every orc of every type to boost my KoT faction, and was
still scowling. However, when I switched to killing FP Militia guards, I
was able to go up to apprehensive in a couple of sessions. A more
extreme example would be killing Lucan which can, supposedly, take you
from KOS to indifferent or better in a single shot.
  My advice, if you want to improve it as quickly as possible, would be
to go for the biggest (preferably named) mobs you can take. Otherwise,
just take the most plentiful, fastest kills and just start hacking away
and keep checking on a "test NPC" periodically.
