    What about the zone-in area in Akheva? Should all be blue, has a
reasonable ZEM, lots of space to kite for an indoors zone. The little alien
guys have poor HPs, so a wizard should be able to tear through them. And
they don't summon.

    Truthfully, you two could go anywhere where there's room to run without
being hit and where the mobs don't cast bad things. For example, as long as
you're the one snaring you could kill mushrooms in Fungus Grove all day -
kite them through the Tarmok areas, plenty of room to move there.
