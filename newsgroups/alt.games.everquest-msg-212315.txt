Not as such, no.  XP per AA point isn't based on your level, its a constant,
the amount needed to level from 51 to 52.  So the fact that it takes little
exp to get from 60 to 61 isn't relevant.

What is relevant is how much raw XP (not as a fraction of your regular XP bar,
which does change from one level to the next) you can generate per hour.
Shortly after the release of POP, 61 was the ideal level for many people to
get AA in, as there were easily killed mobs in the tier one POP zones you
could go thru like butter with the vendor buyable level 61 spell in your
arsenal; after 61 these easy mobs turned cyan and the exp dropped quite a
bit.  I could also make a case for 62, but with the reduction of POP ZEMs, the
opening up of POP zones without needing flags, the change to group xp, the
increase in level range of exp mobs for the post 60 set...well the changes are
too numerous and I haven't been thru my 60s since that change, so I really
can't say.

I can say that as you level up from 51 to 60 each level's increase in xp
generating power makes getting AA in that level easier than the level before.
