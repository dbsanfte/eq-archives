I am using 56k modem, after getting to character screen, choosing character,
and hitting the enter world button, I wait about 20 seconds before I get the
"YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED" message.

Last week, up until yesterday, it let me log in and play for up to a minute
before I got the Packet Loss then the  "YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED" screen,
along with my internet connection suddenly being dropped.

Here are the only changes since it was working smoothly:
Installed Shadows of Luclin,
Installed 512 mb more of RMBS memory (had 128 already)
haven't played on this connection in 5 or 6 months, so ISP might have maade
some minor changes (although I doubt these would effect only Everquest)

ANY SUGGESTIONS?
