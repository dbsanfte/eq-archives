Congratulations, you've got an asshat spell.

It seems like you already plan to sell it though, otherwise you would've
scribed it as soon as you got it.

Even if it's shorter duration than Levitate, the difference is that you no
longer have to carry around bat wings, so it doesn't matter how often you
have to refresh it unless you're stretching your mana bar to the limits.

Personally, beyond having a full spell book, I don't care at all about
Levitation since I have Spirit of Eagle, but I do want Everlasting Breath
eventually.

I'm only missing 4 spells up to 56 though.
Level 29 Beguile Plants (have quest 3/4 done, last piece I don't feel like
camping.)
Level 51 Everlasting Breath; Levitation (yay, asshat spells)
Level 54 Remove Greater Curse  (the big daddy of asshat spells)
