Big cats hardly qualify as "EVERY case" by far. And I have serious

How convenient. And how completely and totally bullshit. In fact,
there HAVE been efforts to prove genetic causes, chemical imbalances,
etc and none have ever found anything even close to definitive.

Ah, okay, so, "retardation" would be anything that deviates from the
"normal". Gotcha.

You presented them as though they were facts. You didn't say "I
believe" or "I think" it's so. You said basically "It IS so".

A response that is totally irrelevant to the point. Your main support
that homosexuality was "abhorant" to nature was the fact that sex is
intended for reproduction. I provided examples of sex that are
commonly practiced and are not done with the intent or likelihood of
reproduction. Why is it okay for someone to use birth control to have
sex when they don't want to procreate (which isn't 100%), but not okay
for someone to have sex with the same gender when they don't want to
procreate (which IS 100%)? Both are "abhorant" to nature due to the
fact that they go against the purpose of sex.

And a horse's ass is a horse's ass.
