I can't speak for any other games, but I played Everquest for 9 months using
24k and 26.4k connections.  It worked great, zoning was a bit slow, but that
was the only real problem.  I now have a wireless broadband connection, and
that has helped significantly with zone times, but that's the only real
difference I see.  Upgrading my video card to a GeForce 2 MX400 was a much
more useful upgrade for everquest, that made a huge difference in places
like Warsliks Woods, and FV near the LoIO zone.  The one problem with a
satellite connection is going to be the latency, particularly a problem if
you play a bard.  With my wireless I am seeing latencies of 80 to 140ms
which is significantly better than my dial up.  With Satellite you should
expect 500ms at best, someone will correct me if I am wrong about that.
