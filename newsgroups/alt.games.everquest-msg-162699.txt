Well, I "sort of" disagree. My experience so far (GM in 3 now, and moving
along in 6) is that skillups to indeed get faster as you approach trivial,
but then tail off rather badly right as you get to trivial. I saw in a
training guide somewhere that the author found his be skillup rate when he
was about 10-15 points below trivial. For me, I'd say 5-10 or so, but those
last few get very, very bad. That's my experience with it anyway. I'm not
the end all beat all in trades that a friend of mine is (geez, he's 250 in
Pottery, and 200 in fishing, baking, brewing, jewelcraft and fletching with
Smithing getting there and Tailoring also over 100). with my two top skills
being just in the 150's ATM, but that's what I've seen.
