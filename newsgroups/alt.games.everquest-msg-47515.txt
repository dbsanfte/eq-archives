To see if its a DNS issue, you could do this, but, depending on your setup,
this could be lengthy.

In either you firewall/router (if you use one) set the IP address for
primary DNS resolution (ie. primary DNS server) in both the firewall and a
client computer to:

206.20.162.14

This is the DNS server that eqtraders.com uses.  If you can connect fine,
its nothing on your side, but rather, the DNS server you originally use to
resolve IP addresses using FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Names [ie.
eqtraders.com]).

Actually, I believe I just figured out the problem.  The DNS servers (the
206.20.162.14) records are screwy.  You -MUST- preceed  eqtraders.com  with
the www.  first, else you aren't going to connect.

Try entering the IP address of 207.202.127.234 and let me know what you come
up with.
