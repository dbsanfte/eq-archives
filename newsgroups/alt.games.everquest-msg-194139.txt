Hmm..It's about time the MPAA was made a felony, they introduce more
anti-freedom based legislation than just about anyone else, they are the
reason why DVD's have regions and you (in the states) get to see stuff

copyright protection, but these guys think its fit to interfere in worldwide
manufacturing processes, merely for their benefit.
