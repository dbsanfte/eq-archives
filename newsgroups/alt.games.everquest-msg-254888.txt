Right... kind of. Typically a guild will have someone check multiple
zones to find out which bosses are up. They will always appear in the
same spot so you will never see a raid wandering around freeport trying
to find Cazic Thule =p. Once the target is identified and the
leadership gives the ok, the raid moves out (depending on the target,
it can be anywhere from 7 to 72 people. More if you want but you will
have to make multiple raids helping each other out). Raid targets in
say elemental PoP will be hitting for around 3,000 with rampage
(hitting another person along with the tank), adds, and whatever the
event entails. I don't know many groups that can put up with a mob
doing 3k a hit :P.
