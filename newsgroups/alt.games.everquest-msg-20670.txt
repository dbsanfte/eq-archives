I'm not going, but if I were I would want to know a little more information
than what they are providing.  Example:  If I chose a shaman, what gear am I
getting battle shaman gear or wis gear.  If I choose a war am I getting resist
gear, ac gear, ability gear, 2 1HS, 2HS, bow?  All this information will make a
big differnece in how I woudl approach the battle.  Or are we given a pile of
armor to choose from, so If I'm going against a shaman, I can take out my CR
leggings and PR breastplate, whereas if I"m going agianst a ranger I can take
out my AC and ability gear.  Caster = sheild for bash...

I think this could be a great event, and even better if they let you pick out
level 24 gear before each fight, but I think that would take too long.
