It is just impossible to tell what you mean.

The hardest class to play with ultimate skill -- that is, the most valuable
player with the most difficult job -- is probably monk.  You have 60 other
people waiting for you to pull Dain or AoW, and it's damn hard, especially if
you have to figure it out for yourself.  A great monk is the MVP of Everquest. 

The hardest class in terms of levelling up and sheer discouragement would
probably be Erudite SK.  Impossible to get a group.   Fatty sk's are hard but at
least they can see, and have some stats.  

The hardest in terms of simple wear and tear would be bard.  I don't see how
they do it.  

Rangers are inherently fun to play so I wouldn't pick any ranger.  Iksar necro,
I imagine, would not be that bad at all.  So you have to give 10 or 20 hours up
for faction work, big deal, especially with PoK transport available thesedays.
