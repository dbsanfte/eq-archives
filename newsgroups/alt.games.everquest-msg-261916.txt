A friend of mine is having problems with Everquest on his pentium 4. He has
ever expansion up to LDON and his operating system is XP. He hasn't been
able to play EQ on his P4 since the OOW expansion was released, so he has
had to use his P3 with Windows 98 SE. It isn't as fast or as good as the
newer computer, but at least he can play EQ on it. Last week someone in a
group told him that they had suffered the same problem and got around it by
installing the OOW expansion.

What we need to know is if you can install the OOW expansion without the GOD
expansion. Hopefully someone out there can answer this question.

Thanx
