I'd rather not have to go through the aggravation of pulling again,
and I'd rather spend time getting my skills up at lower levels then
getting 'mad exp'.

There are two simple things that people can do - /y if they need help
or say it out loud, and for the person wondering if someone needs help
to ask.  If they don't respond, let them be.  If they don't /y for
help and they die when there was someone there willing to help them,
they have no one to blame but themselves.

Usually I speed up on levelling around then, because most of my main
skills will be maxxed at this point and because prior character's
experience leads me to the best hunting grounds for my class/level
combination.  I waste less mana on fizzles (I keep my casting skills
maxxed at each level after level 4), and/or less health lost due to
the fact that my melee skills (my main one, my second, third and forth
may lag a bit) are kept as high as they can be.  It makes going
through the teen times much more of a pleasant playing experience for
me.

I'm not dumb. =)  Been playing EQ since right after release and have a
lot of characters.  Most of them have all their skills maxxed or very
close to maxxed.

>about eq

You may want to stop assuming, since I am an experienced player in the
pre-50 game at least.

I don't care, I'm sort of possessive in that if I'm killing something
at level 5 trying to get my piercing/evo/whatever skill up, I don't
want help unless I ask for it.  I think that's not too much to ask
for. =)

That 1 silver piece isn't worth being 'helped', unless I've asked for
it.

>And just to give you a heads up if you actually make it to higher

I have characters ranging from level 2 to level 52.  I don't think I
need your advice, but feel free to keep dispensing it.  I may learn
something that I don't already know.

I have never seen this happen..  But maybe you have - I'm willing to
give you the benefit of a doubt, something that you are unwilling to
give to me in return.
