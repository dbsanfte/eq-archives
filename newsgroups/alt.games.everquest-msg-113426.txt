I play a druid -- 56th level.
I play an enchanter -- 48th level.

I know both the power of a druid and that of an enchanter.  I know how hard
and easy it is to play each and at what levels.

When my enchanter was gaining levels I would always preface my SoW requests
with "Pardon but could you please spare Sprit of Wolf for a beginning
Enchanter?".  If over 16th level I'd do a "Pardon but would you be willing
to trade Spirit of Wolf for Breeze?"  you get the idea.  Clarity costs 70
mana vs the 40 of SoW and many druids will hound you across zones to get it.
(hell, for KEI form a 60, they'll hunt you across the server! <grin>).

Ignores or declines with weak reasons = Ignore list.  TELL them this and
what it means.. "Sorry for bothering you.  I'll do us both a favor and put
you on my ignore list for future buff, grouping and raid requests.  Take
care.".

I use the Ignore list, from my enchanter, to track the jerks that won't be
allowed to group wtih me later on.  When those sorry folks eventually come
around begging Clarity, C 2 and KEI it is their turn to get annoyed and...

On raids, make sure you check your ignore list SAY -- "sorry folks, either
so-and-so goes or I go.  they are on my ignore list."...

Don't label the class as jerks or bad -- many druids are generous about such
things.  Many are jerks also.  Track the jerks and see that they learn later
on about what's up.  Just realize that 40 mana to a 14th to 20th level Druid
can be quite a bit (for non twinks).  40 mana to an over 50th level Druid is
a joke and won't even twitch the mana bar.

Pass on the advice to others -- you run across a rude druid, just tag them
to your ignore list and let them know you are doing so and why -- to damn
many people just ignore others or politely leave groups without letting
offensive people know what they have done wrong -- like loot pigs.  I've met
a lot of them that didn't realize they were doing it.  A comment and it
clears up -- same with buffs.  A comment or 2 from people CAN prompt
reactions (yeah, some will swear at you.  Others MAY rethink their
positions.)
