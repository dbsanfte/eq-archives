What are you saying?  This looks like utter gibberish.  Probably the result
of 1,000,000 monkeys on 1,000,000 keyboards.  This was the best they could
do...

In case your 12 year old mind can't wrap itself around the above, you are
not readily understandable to people.  Especially those whose first language
is anything other than d00d.

I wonder why you would call yourself sensei grandmaster.  What is that, a
Grand Master Teacher?  Now, Ms. Sharp was the best teacher I ever had, and I
doubt she would ever have the audacity (look it up) to call herself a Grand
Master.  The worst teacher I ever had was Mr. Kilgore and he would have no
problem telling you how great he was and how foolish you were for not
understanding.  He would be likely to call himself a Grand Master (at least
he would know how to use capitalization properly and would never
intentionally misspell words).
