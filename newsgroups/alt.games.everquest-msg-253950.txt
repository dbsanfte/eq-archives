Heh, I just logged my monk, noticed precisely that, and ran back here to 
post a correction, but I see you beat me to it. :)  I'm pretty sure I've 
also seen resist w/o the non-melee damage, but won't swear to it now. :)

However, I also noticed this:  If you click Intimidate, and then duck-duck 
or sit down and stand up, it appears to interrupt the skill... you get no 
message at all before the button refreshes.  Strangely, if you click, 
feign death, and stand back up, the skill carries on to completion.
