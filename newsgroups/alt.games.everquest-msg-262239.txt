ROFL.  You are calling me obtuse?  You do realize that both in my
experience and in my reading by far _the_ most common sole survivor
is the tank?  (That probably has a lot to do with me playing mostly
tanks and reading mostly forums for tank classes.)  Nevermind the
blatant and (apparently) oblivious idocy with which you continuously
insist that NPC tactics are "totally", not mostly, not patheticly,
not sadly, not stupidly, but "totally", ineffectual.
