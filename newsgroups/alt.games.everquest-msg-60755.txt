As a matter of fact, it was I who was there for the companionship.  They
were (believe it or not,) exp hunting there.  Approx. 50% of the mobs we
slayed were true green to them.  But, I didn't care that much.  I just
rolled for my cleric drop spells, and had fun chating with them.

Our groups were typicaly in the high 40's to very low 50's.  More often than
not, I was the lowest level member.  But as was stated, clerics can
sometimes get away with that.  And yes, KC can be great exp; when sufficient
mobs are available for constant killing.  Which is why I didn't much care
for KC when 5 or more groups were already established in KC.  Too much of
just sitting around at full mana, waiting for the puller to find any mob to
pull.

But, I didn't want to group in DL either.  Even with constant chain pulling,
it would still take MANY hours to ding from 48 to 49.  I guess it was my
impatient nature which nudged me away from DL.  I wanted to fight in a zone
with yellow and whites.  I find it more challenging and fun.  But again,
finding people willing to do this is tough.

That's a lot of groups.  The people who play on your sever must be more
civil than Lanys.  When I'm in a tower group, we take everything up top, and
sometimes have to pull from down the stairs just to keep the action moving.
Otherwise, we're just sitting there waiting for spawns.  In addition,
sometimes a CY group has taken both courtyards plus the dogs in the hallway,
so we can't pull from down the stairs.  (Nothing to pull.)

True.  When we had downtime, it seems the thing to do while waiting for
spawns was to complain how slow the exp is for the 53+ crowd.  (I was still
in my upper 40's at this point, and was getting good exp.)

Yeah, almost all those zones you mentioned are empty (even during peek
times) on lanys.  With a few exceptions...the planes are raided every night.
(Planes are fun.)  But the other non-plane zones are empty.  They only see
life when a guild decides to completely "own" the zone for awhile.  And I've
never been in a uberguild.  The guilds I've been assosiated with are general
mid-sized guilds who are more social than acheivment driven.  Velks and DL
are the places to find a group.  But Velks is pretty much a 55+ lvl zone
now.  If you're not at least lvl 55, good luck trying to get into a pick-up
group.

You see, all these zones you mention ARE good zones.  And I love to hunt in
them.  But it's the finding a balanced group who can comit to at least 4
hours of solid play-time that's the problem.  The enchater and cleric class
are very important to a group.  Typicaly, if a group looses one of these two
members, the group either disbands right there (unless a replacement is
onhand,) or has to seriously slow down the pulls to compensate for the loss.
This fact is what prevents people from entering the zones.  Everyone has
been burned in the past by a key group member who suddenly has to "pickup my
girlfriend for dinner", or whatever real-life demand pops up.
