Believe me I and many others here are beating you with that rod as
much as we can, son... you just don't seem to be getting it.

You're a slow learner, I suppose. Maybe been held back a year or two?

P.S. those groups are mostly bottomposters, other than a couple
Outlook gimps. You're pitiful crying and mindless "pre-pubescent"
insults have failed to change that.

Now, can you go any lower?
