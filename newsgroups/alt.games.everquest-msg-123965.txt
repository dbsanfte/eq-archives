Following the free 30day account, I've been trying to get a friend into EQ -
not pushing them into playing, just literally getting the game to run on his
system. Its a P3 600mhz, MatroxG400 system with Win98. I've installed
EQ+Kunark as thats whats on my basic CD. Having patched it, when we try to
run the game, it says 'no 3d Device detected' (immediately after pressing
Play, error appears before the T&C screen should appear) which is odd since
we've found files in the EQ folder that clearly show EQ has detected his 3D
card as its written it into the files.
    I've checked the tech support site and done everything in the knowledge
base. However, still, same error message. Anyone know what might be the
problem.
