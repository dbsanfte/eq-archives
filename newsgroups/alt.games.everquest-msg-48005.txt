There's a damage cap for all of we melee types. (Couple of caps,
actually, I guess.) It's been too long to remember exactly the levels,
damage, etc. but one of them will restrict your damage up to level ten,
to a certain amount, another cap till level 20. And yes, I seem to
recall that 21 damage is one of the caps. It's there to prevent twinks
from coming out of the gates hitting like Gods and having *zero*
challenge in the game. (Though a fully twinked melee can get it to
*near* zero.) You could hand your pally a primal vellium weapon (well,
if they were droppable, that is) and you'd still only hit for 21. It
will come off at the appropriate level and your damage will go up then.
