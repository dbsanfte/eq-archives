$40.00 per month for legends is IMHO way too much to pay for ANY game and to
me just shows more greedy habits by Verants trying to squeak out every last
dime they can from a game that is slowly fading little by little.

I think Legends is a GREAT idea and like the idea a lot but the pricing plan
is just too high with no options other than the monthly plan.  IMHO they
should have charged $25.00 per month at the highest.

Mark my words that if a lot of people go over to legends and pay the price
of it on a steady basis you'll see verants next games, SWG and The war/world
builder one(the name escapes me) come out with a price of IMHO somewhere
between $15 - $25 per month per subscription.  Verant has always prided
themselves for setting the bar in online games and I know it would not be
beyond them to do something like this!

Your opinion?
