There is plenty to do solo, depending on your class of course.

Soloers hardly make up a 'large proportion' of EQ players.  I solo / duo
alot, dont really see that many soloers around compared to groups.  Of
course with no real stats, who knows.

And he did acknowledge soloers, saying there was plenty to do (which there
is).  Dont see what the problem is.

Seems to me he is basically saying, if you want to get uber gear, you need
to raid for it.  And if you dont raid, you probably dont need the uber gear
anyway (not saying it wouldnt help, but it is not needed).

I solo for a few reasons, sometimes a little AA (tactics, HoH, PoV good for
this), sometimes farm pp (seb, dulak, rathe if its very late and I cant be
bothered to go far), quest (have many unfinished quests, epic, shawl etc),
farming tradeskill items, doing tradeskills, helping random people (not
quite solo, but you can use a fair amount of 'solo' time doing this).

Basically, there is already more than enough solo content, more wouldnt hurt
but it isnt really necassary.
