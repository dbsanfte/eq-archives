Wurmslayer is TERRIBLE for taunt.
The high delay makes it difficult to win aggro.

Warriors I've seen at low to mid levels almost universally do not
understand how proximity affects aggro on a lot of mobs.

You'll soon reach a point where pickpocketable items are largely
meaningless to you--with the sole exception of rare spells.  Even gems
aren't that useful and almost all of the velious quest gems aren't
pickpocketable.
