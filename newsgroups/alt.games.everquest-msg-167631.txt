And if those greif players happen to be a guild full of high-level
powergamers? Well, guess you're screwed...

And just how exactly can you "prepare" so that you won't die the
instant you appear on the zone-in before you even have control of your
character?

Clue-by-four for ya: Rallos, vallon, and Tallon Zek aren't blue
servers. None of them allow the training, bind camping, etc. They
actually have some semblance of realisticly fair play rather than
allowing players to run wild abusing game mechanics for an "unnatural"
edge.

Ooh, hey, big risk taker. Playing an evil on SZ. Try it as a good and
see how "easy" it is to get to 58... See how many friends you can call
for backup. Of course you didn't have much hassle, you're playing on
the team that has an overwhelmingly huge advantage. When Verant
considered an option that would help even things out a bit (allowing
evils to attack each other, which makes perfect sense), the evils
threw a temper-tantrum...
