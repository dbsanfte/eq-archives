Thats exactly what they did tonight. after getting pissed off and not
knowing what to do my wife comes up behind me and says, "Honey why dont you
petition a GM?". I was like DUH!!! So i petition a Gm and 3 seconds later an
apprentice Guide comes back at me saying that it is a bug and that the
programmers are working on it... So they summon me to FV. Was nice... real
nice. I would like to thank Guide Lulabye on Zeb for this.
thanks for the info though... and DL is not an option... did that at lvl
19... quickly went to lvl 17. With invis sow and invis vs undead... the
drachnids liked some of that highelven Wizard loving i guess...
/em rubs butt at thought of going through DL again
/em whimpers like a little girl
/em gets out butt plug
/sigh
/say here we go...
