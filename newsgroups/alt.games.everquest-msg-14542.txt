mid-high 30's are a great time to start specter hunting, especially if
you can manage to get the whole Oasis island to yourself.  

Specs dont' have a lot of hit points, but they do hit pretty damned
hard.  Luckily, they aren't terribly magic resistant either, so they
can easily be fear kited.  The only trouble comes from trying to
single pull the specs, the moat around the island makes fiegn pulling
kinda hard if you dont' have levitate, and since they're undead,
Harmony ain't gonna work.  And since they're casters, root parking
isnt' a great idea, either.
