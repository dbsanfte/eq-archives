Yes, each type of Hide covers 5 levels of spells, up to level 49.
After that it's a different "stationery" drop for each level from
50-70.  (And there are "papers" for levels 71-75 but no recipes
yet that use them.)  The drops appear to come from caster-type mobs
of about the level of the spell or slightly higher.

I've built up a supply of all levels of stationery and restock it as
needed mostly through Buyer mode; most levels come in at a few
hundred plat tops, with a few types creeping past 1K, though sellers
as usual are asking for noticeably more.

And yes, all the different papers do take up a lot of bank space, as
do the powders and treatments and additives etc., but once it's all
set up making stuff is a blast!
