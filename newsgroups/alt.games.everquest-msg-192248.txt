Yup, those were the ones I always saw too. 

Monks used to be the premier twink/alt class. Lot's of All/All gear to
choose from, and decent soloers (bind wound/mend and FD on overpulls).
Throw on a Fungi and they were incredible soloers. The twinks never
bothered me. The problem was that there were so many (and a lot of
other classes complained) SOE/Verant took notice. Anytime a class
sticks out from the crowd they get nerfed. Kind of like a game of
whack-a-mole hehe. Too bad the average monks got beat up the worst
with the nerf stick
