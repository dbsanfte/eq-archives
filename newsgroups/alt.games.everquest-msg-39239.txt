You will not evade me, "Joe Blevins" <jh1blev@home.com>:

>What's your favorite race (overall):

Wood elves. We are self sufficient food wise, one with nature, come
from a beautiful forest, are efficient at all our class options (even
warrior. We might be stunned from the front, but we don't block small
passages in dungeons.) and look stunning. Our only drawbacks are that
we can't wear robes, and that many of us are played by clueless gimps.
(Wood elf clerics and casters would be cool, but the bookish stuff is
better left to the pale ones in their marble halls, I guess)

>Favorite Race group (as in Wood Elf/High Elf/Half Elf,
>Barbarian/Human/Erudite, etc.):

Elves. High elves for what the wood elves can't do, and half elves to
complement them both and spread elfdom to Antonica. At a stretch, toss
in the renegade dark elves for a taste of evil.
We have pointy ears.
Gnomes are nice too: they have pointy ears, come from Faydwer as well
and aren't as snooty as the high elves. My gnome mage is in fact an
honorary elf and adopted child of Kelethin and Felwithe.
Trolls might also have pointy ears, but they're too big and ugly and
they eat elves instead of working with them, so I don't like trolls
any more than I like ogres. Sorry, Jakugg.

>Favorite Race/Class combo:

See my signature. 

I have a fondness for elven rogues, human monks, and magicians. My
young wood elf warrior and dark elf shadow knight share a fondness for
barbarian shamans. My gnome magician loves pretty much anyone unless
they try to eat her for lunch.
