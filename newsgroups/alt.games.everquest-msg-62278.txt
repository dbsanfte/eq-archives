Don't listen to him. I'm evil. He's only saying that because I am
currently holding every pp he owns.

Hence why I avoid that place like the plague and will only go there to
get my epic piece. The problem is, sometimes the morons take trips
elsewhere...

Same here. I don't /anon, don't get begged much... but I know others
who are veritably hounded.

That partially has to do with the people who go - I know of good
pick-up leaders, and I've heard of very bad pick-up leaders.

>Just my 2cp

My 2cp: EMarr isn't the perfect server, but it's the nicest of the
servers I've looked at. If you just know how to avoid the bad seeds,
it's a terrific place even if we do have our share of scammers, gimps
and morons. 

>And no one on EMarr cares if you top-post.

We don't? Just because we haven't made you burn in hell yet? Just
wait, I'm going to kill you and dance on your corpses and never port
you to Permafrost again - just because!

(The atmospheric socials in Hate are very neat, by the way. The
buttkissing choir praising Inny does get tiresome but I guess it's
just to make us hate it more, and Inny who won't shut up about his
elder god schtick when he's aggroed? Give me a break. *slaughters
everyone*)

Um, anyway, I was supposed to go to Fear with Drywit et. al. last
night, but RL issues prevented me from logging in in time. However,
shortly after I'd logged in, guild leader asked if anyone wanted to
come to Hate with another guild, who were setting out to take down
Inny (incidentally, it was Cadfael's guild, but he wasn't around). An
enchanter and I wanted to go, so I got my first view of Hate. Neat
place :) I didn't get anything other than some faction hits (I didn't
bottom out my Hate faction. Drat) and a ton of screenshots, but that
was all I set out to get, and I got to see bits of second floor before
getting too tired to stay - was told they wouldn't kill Inny for a
while, so decided to just end my grand tour of the plane before that.

There were only two annoyances: One was my ISP crapping out on me
while on 2nd floor, and the second was that as I started to port
myself out, I saw them fight another mob, thought to myself that maybe
I should have stayed a little longer but oh well, let the port finish,
sold some minor junk and was about to camp when my guildleader started
about how the disciple of Innoruuk they just killed had dropped druid
bracers, and the raiding guild didn't want them. *Bashing head against
wall* ensued.

Thankfully, one of their druids told me that they'd forgotten that one
of their alt druids was up there and that he'd gotten the bracer.
Since it didn't rot and it wouldn't have been mine after all, it's not
so annoying - but I really felt like someone had waved candy under my
nose and taunted me that I couldn't have it :) (Kinda wish it hadn't
been a Harmony piece I was lusting after, too ;) )

My guildleader has been asked to NEVER tell me if something like that
happens again :)
