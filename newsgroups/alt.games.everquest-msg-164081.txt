Well, the numbers themselves are subject to no limitation at all.
And while there are limitations to digital representation and
graphic presentations, the numbers in use are nowhere near pushing
these limitations.  I'd say the only real limit is the appetite
of the paying customers for the next round of "phat lewts".  It
would appear that we (the player population taken as a whole) are
little more than a few hundred thousand two-legged gerbils happily
sending the electronic abstraction of an abstraction to SOE in
exchange for pretty pictures to watch while we run our treadmills.
And there looks to be no end in sight, at least so far.
