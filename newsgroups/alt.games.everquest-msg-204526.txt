And I said as much to the guildmates I talked to; if the guild requires that
I do this, and have no workaround, then the choice is for me to change or to
leave the guild.

I still find it difficult to believe that there is any content outside POP
that can't be skipped by a few people in the guild without crippling them

There are parts of the high end game I find interesting, but there are also
parts I don't.  Interesting: going new places, doing new things, getting new
gear, watching your guild get more powerful and better skilled.  Not
interesting: going to the same place again and again, killing tons of greens
for days and days on end...

Talk about rehashing the same levels and zones over and over again, thats
the -problem- with the high end game; I might have spent 4 days in Gunthak
going from 36 to 40... but the guild I was in spent two months in Ssraa
killing green mobs to get emperor key parts!  In that same time period I
went from 1 to 48, in a hundred zones, and hardly ever killing greens  (one
or two had to die for quest purposes, but thats about it).  To me, that
wasn't rehashing the same levels, either, as it was a different class, and
so I was learning the whole way up, still am.  And it wasn't the same zones
either, I've been places I never went before, and places in old familiar
zones I'd never done before

I do mean Vex Thal key as well, the Emperor part being apparantly a piece of
that effort.  But I kid you not, every time I logged in my cleric to do a
rez or something, if they werent' announcing a raid target, they were going
to Ssraa for key parts.  For two solid months, the entire life span of my
shaman.  I went along on a few of those runs with my cleric or my bard.
Pound your head against the wall dull.  Oh hey, what shall we kill next?
How about a snake.  That was easy, how about another.  Gee this is starting
to get old, what shall we do next?  Oh yes, another snake.  These are green
you know.  Yep but we are going to kill em some more just to show em who's
boss.  Well, that was a rewarding five hour camp, what are we going to do
tomorrow.  Oh, kill more snakes, I see.  Day after?  Snakes.  Next week?
Snakes.  Next year?  Probably still snakes.  What does all this camping
finally get us?  The ability to go to Vex Thal!  Where we kill what?  Well
I'll give you a hint, we'll want Shissar Bane weapons when we go.

Oh and it doesn't help that my cleric did a couple levels in the Grey
killing the undead solo and grouping on.....wait for it..... snakes.  At
least back then they were exp mobs.
