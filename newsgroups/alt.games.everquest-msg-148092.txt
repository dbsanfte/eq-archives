The traditional Verant respponse seems to involve deleting the files for
that zone and the associated data files for that character (I believe its
the opt and ini files for that character - ie- charname.opt and charname.ini
files). And re downloading the zone. The oddity however seems to be  in your
characters files. The only downside to this is you will lose any hotkeys
associated with that character and also the settings for your colors and
textures. Obviously its not a problem with the zone files as you have stated
that your other character can zone there - so re doing the zone files may be
unnecessary. I used to have this problem with sanctus seru and that was how
I was able to fix it. Best of luck to you.
