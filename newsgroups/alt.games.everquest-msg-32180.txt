You'd think so, but it's not.   Rivervale and Runnyeye are both
very short zones, and the Gorge itself isn't too big either.   Add
in the complexity of getting through HHP to anyone who hasn't
been there before and it's not even a close call.

BTW, you have to add NRo in there between Oasis and EC.....
