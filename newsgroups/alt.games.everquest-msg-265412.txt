Two hours here. SC just switched to electronic vote taking machines,
so many people cried witchcraft... err... took a little longer to
figure them out.

I don't know why I waited two hours to vote (also include the 45
minute drive to get there, as I recently moved and did not yet put
through the change of address) I don't think I'd wait in line 2 hours
for a free blow job.
