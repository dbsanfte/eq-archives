It gives you an extra second or two if you drop selos while kiting to live.. 
which is oft all you need...but that's usually only if you can make a 
beeline away from your pursuing tangle of mobs instead of attempting to 
continue your selos driven circle around them.

> 2. Are there many mobs in the game that can outrun Run3?

Not many that I've encountered.. I worry more bout summoning mobs than fast 
mobs. The lions in NK can outrun it lol

> 3. What have the experiences of other bards been like?

RS3 was the first thing I went for.. then regen 3, so that I may get my 
class abilities.. ie Mana regen (the most important AA below arch if you ask 
me)

Once you hit your mid 50s and start getting some really useful songs, you'll 
find AA come fast and easy, I'd start around 55 and pick up 20 or so.. at 55 
I was making an AA every couple hours.. that's with med breaks (which for a 
bard with a 3k mana pool constitues making lunch, folding laundry and 
reading War of the Worlds) Plus also making around 1k-1.5k per hour on 
average, just kiting OC or armory in dulak (there is a merchant in dulak the 
swabby baitsman.. just use invis, get behind him, hit sneak and sell all 
those harpoons and shields.. it adds up fast, not to mention the BDs and Ds 
that drop fairly often) Hope this helps, or at least I don't get flamed by 
the likes of the troll hunters in this group, you guys are avorice aren't 
you?
