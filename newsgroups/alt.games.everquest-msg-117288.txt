That would be too hard to implement and not really viable.
I always have inspect off because I can't see a use for it, I leave the
messages on because it isn't the inspect that bothers me and turning it off
won't make the idiot, in my face and view, transparent to me.

I honestly don't see a point to inspect really, in it's present form it
isn't roleplay, sure, in real life you could see I'm wearing a 3 piece suit
if you looked but you wouldn't be able to look at the label to see if it was
Hugo Boss or a cheap imitation, well, I guess you could if you want to risk
a visit to A'n E.
It's not roleplay like, if it was it would say my leggings appear to be
crafted from the scales of a dragon rather than "Heavy Dragonleg Breeches"
or alternatively (and this would actually be my preference) go the whole hog
and add the stats to the inspect, too. That way people can inspect  me see
what I have and what the stats are, although I guess they'll still ask where
it came from.

Actually that sounds like you just met some rather sad people rather than
the idiots I am thinking of...If you haven't met any yet then well done but
I'd wager you will.
