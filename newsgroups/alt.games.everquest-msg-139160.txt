No no no.  One blew his *early*.  He used it on someone before the main 
fight even happened.  The rest used theirs up pretty quick, and they 
weren't fighting at all - just sitting on a hillside with the tank 
targeted, waiting to hit LoH and send a chat message telling everyone.  
Surely pallies are good for more than that?  I haven't grouped with 
enough to know what their general role is, though.

MT went down so fast the first pally didn't even have time to hit his 
LoH button.  That guy is MEAN.

Hmmm... you busy in 10 levels? >;)
