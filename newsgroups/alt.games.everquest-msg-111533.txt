So all this is based on your supposition that EQ2 will mean the end of
EQ1?  What if you are supposing incorrectly?  It seems more than likely
to me that they will not shut down EQ1 until they have so few
subscribers as to make it unprofitable.  Before they reach that point
they may condense some servers, but I rather doubt that they will close
down the existing game as soon as they release the new one.  From a
business standpoint it makes sense to continue to derive revenue from
existing content even as they seek new revenue from the new product so
long as there is profit to be made.  

So you may well be going off the deep end over nothing, you can continue
to play the original even after the new release.  Note there is as much
support for my supposition as yours, both are mere supposition, in fact
more when you consider the fiscal aspects.  So long as there is demand
it will remain.
