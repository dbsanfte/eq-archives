If you say so, a 56 million dollar contract seems a bit high for me, but hey
we have our opinion, I dont go to live sporting events precisely because I
feel that are overpaid, just my IMHO, Im not arguing on this anymore.  You
dont have a problem with it keep going.  I also don't go to many movies, and
never go to concerts, music sounds much worse live IMHO again.  authors and
musicians though write the music I dont have much of a problem with them as
I do with actors who just read from a script, the writers should get those
millions, and sports players, its a GAME, its fun to do, what work an sweat
are you talking about, I go play hockey with friends all the time and I work
out and sweat too, so should somone pay me millions?
