If the loot is really appropriate for the level of the zone, high levels
aren't going to farm it.  If the loot is better than the zone level
would indicate, the trivial stuff won't stop farming.  It will just
change it so that instead of taking a high level character and farming,
you take a low level character to farm, and a high level to protect the
low level.  Net result: farmers are replaced with farmers/powerlevelers.
