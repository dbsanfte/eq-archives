I think if the guy had started a thread titled "Is this a bug?" and asked that
question instead of stating this major bug existed and asking for everybody
else to flood verant with bug reports Dark Tyger might have gone a bit easier.

obvious, giving the players a get out of death free card would kind of remove
the challenge.
