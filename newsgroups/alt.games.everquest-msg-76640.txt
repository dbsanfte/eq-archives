The only poison that I ever tried on him was for my main's guildee, and the
poison was actually made by my alt rogue (main has like 48  skill and alt
has 227 poison skill) was the one with two Heartsting venom sacs from
scorpions in Field of Bone.  It's a root + 60%  slow or something, and I got
it to stick twice during the fight (lasts more than a minute, IIRC).

My new favorite is Soul Burn, though...2 semi-rare drops off of Scorpion
men in  the Overthere and I've had it hit for 425 DD before.  I was too
scared to use it on the General raid, though, simply because opening
with a 1100 double backstab (which is rare, especially on opening attack...
but it HAS happened) followed by a 400+ poison nuke would equal one
quickly dead rogue :-).  And it's still not trivial at 227 skill.

It's fun to use on Sand Giants, though...
:-)
