Ah, a real answer.  I appreciate that; thanks Ridah.

To counter:  epic rezzes leave folks with about 20 percent health and
greatly reduced stats for five minutes.  So mana has to spent healing them,
and time has to be spent targeting them for said heals.  So even rezzed
folks are useless for a while.  And if you're fighting a mob that takes
twenty minutes or more to kill, then your clerics are spending their time
doing the CH cycle rather than rezzing mobs - because if you're not doing a
CH cycle, you're simply not going to be able to rez folks fast enough.

And even in your above scenario, all you'd need is *one* epic cleric to make
it work.  Just have someone drag corpses to the epic cleric to be rezzed,
healed, and sent back in.  It's not a very good strategy, but I suppose it's
viable.

But more epic clerics won't make it more viable.  And unleashing 100 epic
clerics all at once won't mean that 100 zerging guilds will spring up
overnight.  Zerging takes bodies, and lots of them.  I don't see how making
many cleric epics available would suddenly mean zerging would become rampant
on a server; there's a limit to how many 55+ folks you can form zerging
guilds with.

So, while I understand your argument, I don't agree.  I don't agree that
increasing the rate at which cleric epics get introduced into the world lead
to widespread zerging.

Maybe I'm just bitter; yesterday, one of the Beastlords in our guild hadn't
even started his epic.  We started farming some drops (got three of the four
he needs).  By this weekend he'll have his drops and we'll kick off the
series of battles that will lead to him getting his epic.  We'll do this
with a couple of groups of 60ish folks.  By Saturday night he'll be epic.
No, I'm not jealous at all.  <grumbles>
