Yeah, but it's also annoying to have someone throw up a bunch of
otherwise useless buffs on the party, and then be forced to sit around
and wait on them to med back up.  Shamans are particularly bad about
this.

If I'm tanking, all I'm really interested in is the best AC buff the
party can give, Sow, and a Regen if it's avaliable.  If I'm playing my
caster, all I'm worried about is a sow and clarity.  Anything else is
a waste, IMHO.
