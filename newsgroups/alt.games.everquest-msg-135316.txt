Do you really think it sounds that elitist?

I would see it more that, after going through every single level the game
has to offer (multiple times), I can offer an opinion thats based on
something more than hearsay, about "whats a tough level" and whats not.  Of
course my opinion is exactly that, and theres always a chance that im wrong.

I do believe I have more basis for saying levels xxx - xx are tough, but
level xx and xx are easy, than somebody whos main is a level 35.  Call that
an elitist attitude if you wish.. I call it speaking from experience though

Btw ive never split them into bands like that... but if I did, i probably
would go along with
"Mid-range is mid-40s to low 50s.  Upper level would be 55+, and high level
being 59+"

Somebody said "level 60 being endgame"... heh i see a LOT of clueless idiots
that made 60, and not just because of ebay.. it doesn't take skill to get
level 60 (tho obviously if you suck its going to take  lot longer)...

I also dont view "endgame" based on peoples guild tags... I see people in
the servers number 1 and 2 uber guilds that I think "god are these people
ebay or something?!?!"   I also see people in tiny guilds that I think "gd,
this person rocks".

Top guilds obviously have some very knowledgable people in them... they also
have people in them just using it as a ticket to free endgame loot.
