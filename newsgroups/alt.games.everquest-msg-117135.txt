I'd have to disagree for one main reason:

Exploring.

With my 60 rogue, if I'm not raiding, he's
often camped at the site of our next raid.

My alt rogue gets around in her guild and
has a lot of fun, and is known for helping
guildees with quests (epics, Coldain
rings, etc), or just good old exp grinding.

The difference is that if I am just bored
(and I hate most TV), I can log on my
assassin and run around almost
ANYWHERE on Norrath or Luclin.  Nothing
much can hurt me, so I can explore and
visit places I'd never seen before. Drolvarg
caves in FV, Grachnist's fort in WW,
all of Dalnir, sneaking around in Droga,
etc.  Makes me feel roguish, plus that fact
that at 60 with Jboots I can sneak/hide
with no speed loss.  It's just fun to be
able to know that if you happen to see
something good in Droga, you can not
only kill that goblin, but also his 9 friends
that add before healing back up and
sneaking around again.

Raiding is also fun, whether it be some mobs
in Kael for faction repair, or Grieg's end
and getting turned into a Froglok (while I
look the same, some of my screenshots
taken by other guildees are neat...I
REALLY wish they had some illusion masks
that did illusions like Froglok or goblins or
orcs).

It all depends on your personality, I
guess...running through RunnyEye
at level 60 is a great way to bleed off
stress, plus the fact that you can look
at any part of the dungeon you want
without real fear...sure, a train may
happen, but if you can't kill the whole
thing (not really much problem in RE),
you can still probably survive a run to
the zone.
