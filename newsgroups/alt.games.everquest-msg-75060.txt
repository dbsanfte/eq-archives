The craziest puller I ever grouped with was an enchanter.  He is the only
enchanter I have ever grouped with that was a puller.  He had jboots, we
were in DL, and he kept a constant supply of mobs mezzed near our group,
ready to be killed.  Only had to heal him once during the entire time.  It
was actually quite amazing to see.  We had him, my shammy, a cleric, a
ranger, a warrior, and a rogue.  We went nonstop.
