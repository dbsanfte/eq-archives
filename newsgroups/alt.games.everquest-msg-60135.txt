   When I first started playing, I thought that I 
would like to have characters on all or most of 
the characters.  That way, I could get to know
more of the people playing the game!  I think I
actually started random level 1's on about 20 or
servers before I gave up.  I played a few of them
to, so now I have several level two's here and 
there.  Eventually I learned the errors of my 
ways and settled down, more or less.

Annie  <--- Started the necro on another server
            so that I could play solo when my 
            husband isn't on without feeling 
            guilty about leveling without him.
