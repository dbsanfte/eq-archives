As I said in the other post, the level 10 quest cap plus the need for
40ish skill to finish the level 10 cap was off. The gap was just too
high. I don't mind a cap, just not one that required you to double
your points on scarce opportunities, but allowed you to cap your
artisan skill before you ever got to Qeynos. I can't even imagine
those of you who did no artisan on the Isle, I have been finding it
mind numbing running around zones looking for anything to harvest; to
start from scratch.... :-(
