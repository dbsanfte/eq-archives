Logitech finally released XP mouse drivers for my opti-mouse.  That's all I
was waiting for.  Like others have mentioned, while XP is more of a Windows
2000 upgrade, it has other compatibility features that make it much more
forgiving on Windows 98/ME-based games.

I mention the mouse because even under XP with Windows 98/ME compatibility
settings, EQ ran fine for me except a much slower mouse tracking than under
the 9x series, and in the middle of battle trying to swap a GH spell gem for
a buff with a laggy mouse can mean life or death in this game.  This
Logitech driver did the trick.  I don't know why but the colors seem a
little sharper under XP (64mb ddr gf2) - the sound on through the SBLive!
value is fine, although does sound slightly more "high-end" than under
Windows 9x/ME.

All in all, I think I'll be sticking with XP now as the primary OS on my
Dell box.  I think Sang here mentioned the per-app compatibility mode that I
had totally forgotten about - and had subsequently given up on XP for gaming
altogether.

I'd say definitely go for it.
