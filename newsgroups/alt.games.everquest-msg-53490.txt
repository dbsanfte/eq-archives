Yes

Halfings have 5 percent less xp to level than baseline races. 
Its part of Verant lore that they meant to give the humans the 5
percent and messed it up so consequently halflings have it.

Baseline races are Human, dark elf, half elf, wood elf, high elf,
erudite and any other one I forgot.

Barbarians need 10 percent more xp than those baseline races to level,
presumeably due to their larger str and sta and the fact they can
slam/bash even with a 2 hand weapon.

Ogres need 15 percent more than baseline since HUGE str and sta, slam
and can't be stunned from frontal melee attacks (still can from magic
stun spells of course)

Trolls need 20 percent more xp to level than base for large race junk
and Regen.

Iksar need 20 percent more also for regen and for the 100 swimming
they get at the start to probably give them something else making 20
percent seem ok.

This info was all availible from the showeq site when they figured it
out. Another bit of lore is that one of the main guys working on
ShowEQ got hired by Verant because of it. His verant RP name is Rowyl
and he is the guy who is head of the programming of the move to direct
x 8 and such and he did the nice new transparent UI for velious and
such. The thurg quest armor for druid's is also named after him.

There, more about xp than you ever wanted to know.
