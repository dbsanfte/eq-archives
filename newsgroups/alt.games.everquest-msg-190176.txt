You can't play two characters on teh same account at the same time.

In order to play 2 characters at the same time, you have to have two
accounts, and the characters each have to be on different accounts, i.e. you
could use your druid on your one account to powerlevel your paladin on your
second account, or you could group your magician on one account with your
cleric on the other.

If you want to play 2 characters from your first account, you have to set up
your second account with the same credit card you used for your first, and
then get one of the characters transferred to the second account. This is *
not * the same as transferring from one server to another, you get to keep
all your money and items, it jsut allows you to 2-box (play 2 characters on
2 computers at once).
