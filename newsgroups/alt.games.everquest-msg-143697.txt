The drakes are more fun anyway, I was saddened when I found
they went Cyan before the wyverns did.

Another good plan is to do the chest and pull a bird in between,
chest is a single spawn on a six minute clock, and no quadder in
his right mind is going to get involved with it since it moves at a
different rate than wyverns and otters

Otters... well I know they remain great exp at 60, but I really
like being in a zone where I'm ally to most of the mobs, even if
I have killed a couple thousand of them!
