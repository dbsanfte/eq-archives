First off, JK said you were a gnome (didn't read your whole post, it's
almost time to go home).  You'd better be damned grumpy know you're better
than anyone else!  Don't bring shame to our race/profession by feeling like
you're only just as good as all other races or classes when we're obviously
infinitely superior.

Back out of character:

Level 1:
pet (of course)
minor shielding
shallow breath
Strengthen as money permits.  It's your one and only STR buff and although
it's sucky sometimes I still use it at 55.

Level 4:
Gate & pet are no-brainers
Haze (AC)
Color Flux (stun)
Mez (this and stun are most useful for running away unless you're already
familiar with their raw power...I wasn't at the time)
Suffocating Sphere

Tash, Invis and illusions as money permits
