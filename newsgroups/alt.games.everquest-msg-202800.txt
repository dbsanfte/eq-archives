So did I but I thought I'd test the theory first...as it goes we were wrong
he had the name from some knight in local history, obscure enough to be
valid and not trying to be some clever play on words...

No I did get it and I thought the same thing, we were wrong and I am glad I

didn't seem to care you did

wouldn't be typing this post.
So I kind of stand corrected.
You have come across as almost itchin for an arguement recently, not as bad

at any time.
