Cancel Magic a player (or approriate class mob) can cast removes
buffs at random.  What is happening in the above example is Root is
overwriting your JourneymanBoots buff/icon and has nothing to do with
the Cancel Magic spell line.

I've had mobs dispell their own root off me in an attempt to get at
my buffs.
