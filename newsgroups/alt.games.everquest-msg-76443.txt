Verant says that he has an equal right, but I say he should go and find
another place to hunt. Ive had this happen to me so many times, when there
are plenty of other camps and wandering mobs to hunt. They know if they
force you to share, that you will probably leave and find another place for
yourself. Often if you call their bluff and stay, they will leave after a
while.
I guess its a choice between being "immature" and being walked all over.
