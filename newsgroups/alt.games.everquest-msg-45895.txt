Funny you should mention it.  I snuck through there just the other day for
the first time, after noticing the tunnel on my map.  At the end of the
tunnel are two named giants, named something like "Eldrax __" and "Mendak
(?)".  I couldn't find either name on a quick search at a couple of eq
sites.

I kept one targetted as I left and when I got out of the fort, dropped
sneak/hide.  I was indiff - so I'm figuring they're both for quests.  I'm
kos to the other giants.
