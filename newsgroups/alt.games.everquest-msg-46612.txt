Easy plane for the most part.  Port up invis (if your break group(s) )  Fight
some junk, follow leader to next camp after way is clear.  ALWAYS assist MA
never target a mob by clickin.  the only thing you would need resists for is
Inny which is MR for the g flux but besides that its a really relaxing plane
with a good puller.  Loots usually suck for warriors though unless you get to
kill the grandmaster who drops 2-3 armor pieces plus another drop that the
"old" inny used to have in his loot table.
