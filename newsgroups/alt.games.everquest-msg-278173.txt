I don't like it but not for the reasons you state. Dealing with the
guild bank, I was afraid that something would happen and it happened
to me today. When two people are browsing the same merchant and the
other buys the merchant out of something, *your* list is reset to
the top again. I don't like the way the list resets when you buy
something out, either. Makes vendor mining a pain in the patootie.
