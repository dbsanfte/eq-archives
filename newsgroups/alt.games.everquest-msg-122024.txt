Murder is more shocking than assault. I'm not going to downplay either
one in hopes that it goes away.

It's sad that these days people feel that we should take the passive
approach and "take away the power" of certain words by ignoring their
usage. That's a load of *crap*.

People should be shunned for behaving inappropriately, not tolerated.
There should be a level of accountability.
