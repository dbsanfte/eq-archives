Can someone confirm if I am or am not missing posts?  I posted a message 10
hours ago & its not showing up.  Neither is anything over just more than a 5
hour time period.

I see the subjects "The drama", "/drool", & "Fizzles!!", posted at 01:01,
01:03, & 02:38 (Central time).
The next ones I see are subjects "Wuoshi killed me!", "Is Radeon 8500LE good
with EQ?", & "Site to download EQDIARY?", posted at 07:50, 08:15, & 08:37
(Central time).

I'm missing anything occurring between that 5+ hour time.

Can someone confirm this for me?  I'm using Giganews, which normally is VERY
good about getting posts (unless they are obvious spam, crossposted to MANY
groups, in which case I'll only see the replies from others).  I've tested
this with other software I've got & it says the same thing.  I tried Google,
but I REALLY don't like their system, calling every different subject as a
new topic, and also they are missing FAR more than I am.
