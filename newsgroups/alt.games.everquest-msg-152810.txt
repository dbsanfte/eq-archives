There is no reason to need mezzing there. Any competent puller can pull
single or doubles. There are no other pops at all.

You pull the right top first , then the left , then the back. Then you swim
to the star on the left and slowly drop down untill phinny aggroes and you
bring him solo.

What it sound like is that your raid flubbed the pull badly and decided to
blame the chanter.
