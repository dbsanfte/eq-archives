Hmm... If they didnt ban fearing... when you feared a mob, the mob
would just go into the hall, and stand in place... while you beat the
crap out of it... it never moves untill the fear drops.  Effectively
Rooting and Fearing a mob at the same time.  So, Id say in essence
they did fix the Xploit... but did not fix the pathing.

So, yes they did fix it.
