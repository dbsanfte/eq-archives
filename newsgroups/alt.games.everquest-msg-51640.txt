I am waiting on DAoC to arrive (this week) but I have no intention of
cancelling my EQ accounts just yet, if at all).
From watching friends play DAoC it seems they have made things, well, easier
than EQ.

You die, you don't have to find your corpse you appear at your bind point
fully equipped (ok this was done to make RvR combat more acceptable, the
possibility of leaving all your nice equipment in another realm would just
mean under equipped raids)

Money Weighs nothing (same as AC now) and auto changes up (get 100copper and
it'll automagically turn into 1sp) There are banks (vaults) designed for
storing items but do not hold money.

There is no need for food and drink.

No one has night vision (as opposed to EQ where it would appear everyone now
has it) but they have an inbuilt light, toggle activated (presumably shines
out of their arse)

You have a compass (no more having to learn to tell where you heading with a
skill)

These are things I have noticed just watching, it seems Mythic read this NG
and listened to all the whining. I like the look of the game and will try it
but at a first glance it looks like EQ lite to me.

I keep getting told that money is hard to come by in DAoC but I just put
this down to players used to having mid 40 - mid 50 characters in EQ now
starting as a newbie (at the same time as the rest of the server, newbie
zones on FV, anyone?)

There are some really good ideas in DAoC and I hope Verant steal them,
mythic stole enough off of other games. I also hope Mythic use the
auction/trading method from AO.
The ideas that I am less with impressed with are not so much that they are
"bad" but that they have taken some of the challenge out of the game,
remember the first time you looted a fire beetle eye and how long that
remained as your light source? Or when you got Sense Heading up to a point
where it worked more often than not and how much easier that made things
when it rained.

CF
Looking forward to seeing if all the fuss is worth it, then getting back to
making 51 ;ï¿½)
