I was in warrens the other day and a lower level sent a /shout
"can someone power level me please"
I replied
"be right there i'll buff you up,ok?"
So i run over there and cast all my Lv33 ranger buffs (stop laughing
druids:)  ) and no thanks for it, so after now being oom i continue to SB.
Before the zone in the warrens i see a shout
"anyone got any real buffs as the ones i've got are crap"
The whole zone just laughs at the one 'with crap buffs' And she left the
zone.

I know skin like stone, riftwinds protection, thistle coat, spirit of wolf,
strenth of earth and feet like cat, and vigor are not the greatest buffs!
but hey it helps a lv20 right???
