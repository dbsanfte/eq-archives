Unless they've changed it since I hunted there, Frost Giant Toes sell
to vendors for around 7pp each (heads are worth nothing except to the
occasional player, I can recall selling a few sets of 8 heads for 40pp
or so).  So, you might try reining in that itchy trigger finger on the
destroy button at least until you've verified that the various drops
you're seeing in a new zone are actually worthless.  Also, there are a
few droppable rare drops scattered across the game that are worth
something to other players, so when hunting a new zone I always hang
on to apparent junk until it is clear that it is both common and also
worthless to vendors.
