I'm a graduate student researching online communities, and I am hoping
some of you will respond.  Please e-mail me at taninivver@aol.com with
your replies to the following questions:

1. Do you believe that EverQuest players constitute an online
community, given the following definition: "An online community is a
group of people who interact in a virtual environment. They have a
purpose, are supported by technology, and are guided by norms and
policies"?  Moreover, there is a set of variables that more or less
affects the degree of closeness (and sense of community) felt by their
members:

� Physical as well as virtual presence 
� Purpose 
� Supporting software environment (interface methodology/ forum) 
� Number of members 
� Life-span of Community 
� Stage in life-cycle of Community 
� Culture of members 
� Governance structure and associated norms and rules

If you believe EverQuest members as a whole constitute a community,
please explain why, using the definition and variables listed above.

2. Are there social stratifications or social organizations among
EverQuest players (ie. communities within the collective body of
EverQuest players)?  Please describe.

3.  Please describe your experiences as a part of the EverQuest
"community," as well as some basic demographic data including
educational level, profession, nationality, approximate age, years of
experience with computers and the internet, and reasons for playing
EverQuest.  Please DO NOT provide any personal information you do not
want disclosed in a published article.

My thanks in advance for your prticipation.

J.
