I don't know if it just begins there, but it sure is different.  I just got
my first character to 51 and I'm a bit lost.  I had trouble finding a guild
below 50 because no one really takes a guild seriously or takes a player
seriously below that level (maybe down to 45, but certainly not much below
that) So here I am at 51 and I've only been on a handful of raids.  I solo'd
most of the way because it was so much faster, so here I am at 51, knowing
very little about the various guilds and a pretty small list of friends.
Sigh

I had a blast getting there, so I guess it will just take some time to
figure out what comes next.  In the meantime I will "attempt" to kill things
to get exp. and learn how to be sociable again.
