There's a couple of ways of doing it that people usually use, and they
don't involve grouping.

The commonest is this one:  A lowbie is escorted to a bunch of
all-reds, then kept alive with heals/buffs while they "solo" mobs on
their own that would normally use them as toothpicks. 

Slightly less common is this one:  Someone gets a huge DS (and these
days also takes a Skinspike potion, I'd guess, since they stack) and
then pulls a bunch of red cons (if not most of the zone) for the
lowbie. The puller simply stands there, regenned and healed as needed,
and lets the mobs "hedgehog" themselves to death on them.  The puller
does not fight back in any way, so the lowbie only has to do a point
of damage on each of the mobs to get the xp, as damage caused by a
Damage Shield is classed as 'neutral' damage.

Method two would be amazing if there were several people PL'ing a
lowbie...  Imagine a fairly extreme example of lvl 20 caster in, say,
Corathus. Some character with a huge number of hitpoints/AC pulls
half-a dozen mobs to the lowbie, stands there and lets the mobs attack
him/her. The lvl 20, using a 'Ceramic Band', casts the tiny (and thus
not aggro-inducing) damage the ring gives, on each mob in turn - and
the lowbies' job is done.  No risk, no mana used, and because the DS
is 'neutral damage' the lowbie gets all the xp.

Mind you, you can usually tell the gimps who've got up in level using
these ploys!  They often have NO idea how to play their character
properly and, if they are spell-users, spend most of the time fizzling
their spells  :D
