 You'd think so but you'd be wrong. The raid leader isn't going to spend
all that time to balance out groups just to spread xp around. xp is not
the purpose of the raid. The purpose is to drop shit dead and steal
their loots. And you want to do this in the most efficient manner
possible. That's the raidleaders job. Not to listen to a bunch of people
whining that they aren't getting xp.

 Usually if any group in our guild gets two wizards in it, they end up
being the KS group. It's hard for melee to outdamage people that are
landing 4k+ critical nukes on mobs. A single wizard group will probably
KS 75% of the time if they have a couple damage dealers. Nerf Wizards!
