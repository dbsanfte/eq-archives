    Pacify-line doesn't reduce the aggro radius to zero, just to one. If a
pull paths overtop of a Pacified mob, the Pacified mob will come along with
the pull. I've had "resist-but-no-aggro" before, and you do get a resist
message. So just watch the pathing, and if you get no resist messages you
should be fine.
