KEI isn't "God Mode."  You still run out of mana.  There's no
reason to ignore mana efficiency.   Again, it's possible to take
higher level mobs, with more HPs, if you have KEI.  That
means you can't ignore things like that since you'll *still* run
out eventually.

Assuming they kill the same low blues, sure.  No one I know
did that, though.   I certainly didn't when I leveled my wizard
up.  He killed mobs he *couldn't* have killed without KEI
rather than the mobs "appropriate for his level."   Still had to
watch mana management every bit as much.  Even when
forced (due to camps) to take "level appropriate" mobs, he
still needed to watch mana simple because *any* downtime
is non-productive for leveling.

Because DoTs will take on those higher-level mobs my
shaman would kill after debuffing.   Rather than killing
bears or whatever in EC, he'd already moved on to
another zone where XP was easier.   He couldn't have
done it without KEI, but it's nice to kill yellows at the
same rate possible on low-blues when "un-KEI'd"...

Maybe for you.  Others are more than "smart" enough to go
looking for challenging mobs they couldn't kill otherwise.
Better XP, usually better loot, etc.   When I played an alt,
I always went to zones (and left them) "early."   There's
no need to keep killing the same mobs as someone who
doesn't have KEI.  It's stupid to do so, in fact, if there's
a better alternative available.

When you're killing whites for XP at the same rate you could
normally kill low-blues, you level faster.  And you still need
to watch mana, you still need to watch adds, etc.  The only
real difference was the downtime between pulls, which was
faster with KEI.

Your base assumption is wrong, IMO.  Someone willing to
pay for KEI routinely isn't going to be new to the game.  He's
going to be motivated to level as fast as possible.  He's going
to know higher-level mobs are better XP.   And he's going
to know he has the base "power" to do higher-level mobs
with KEI, so he's not going to goof around killing low blues
where he's severely over-powered.  And since he's killing
"appropriate" mobs, he's still going to develop the required
skills.
