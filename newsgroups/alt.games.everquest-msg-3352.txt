Nope.  Only the enchanter's memblur line of spells can remove a person from
the hate list.   And if you are still on the hate list, then mobs can see you
even when you are hiding or invisible.

Hiding during combat is called Evade for rogues, and will make them less
hated, (in order to get the mob to turn around for a backstab) but  it will
never remove you from the hate list.  Hide in combat for any class besides a
rogue does nothing.
