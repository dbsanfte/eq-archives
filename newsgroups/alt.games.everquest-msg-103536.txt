No Ben.  He noted that you had used 'exactly' in a context that clearly
implied exclusivity.  No amount of squirming by you can change that
fact.  If that is not what you meant to do you should have simply
stated that fact.  Instead you have engaged in a series of (to use your
own word) idiotic attempts to deny that while attempting to obfuscate
the issue with strawman arguments.
