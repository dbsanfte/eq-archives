Saw that earlier.  You HAVE to wonder- IS a sytem like that very far off?
We already have electronic billing through Verant- what's to stop them from
implementing things in the game that cost real money?  I don't see it as
much of a logistics problem.
However, then I think that they said the reason there are no casinos in the
game is b/c plat has a "real world" value.  Makes you wonder if they would
do something as nuts as paid events, paid items.. rental horses??
