Study: Lady Lions Like Dark Manes
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS


Filed at 4:52 p.m. ET


WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the Serengeti plain, the lady lion prefers a
swain with a black mane.

That's the finding of a study analyzing how the dense collar of hair
about the neck of male lions affects the love life of Africa's biggest
cat.

Peyton M. West, a researcher at the University of Minnesota, said it's
the mane color, not the length, that matters most to the female lions
of Tanzania.

``We were completely surprised by this,'' said West, first author of
the study appearing Friday in the journal Science.

West said the female lions may instinctively be drawn to the black
manes because males with darker manes seem superior in a number of
ways.

``A dark mane is apparently a marker the female uses to evaluate the
fitness of a male,'' she said. This suggests that lions' manes evolved
over time through sexual selection, said West.

Dark-maned male lions generally have a higher level of testosterone
``which means they are more aggressive fighters,'' said West, and this
can be key to raising cubs successfully.

An aggressive male is more able to chase away invading bachelors who
try to take over the pride, said West. This is important because if
there is a change in male leadership of a pride, the new dominant male
routinely kills all the young cubs sired by the deposed male. Thus, by
choosing to mate dark-maned, aggressive males, a female lion gives her
young a better chance of surviving, the researcher said.

West said that records collected for decades by scientists observing
lions in Tanzania's Serengeti National Park show that male lions with
dark manes are more likely to recover from wounds. She said it is not
clear why this is so.

She noted that dark manes seem to intimidate other male lions, which
means a lion with a black collar of hair has to fight less often and
therefore has fewer injuries.

West and her co-author, Craig Packer of the University of Minnesota,
investigated the effects of mane color by setting up life-sized models
of lions near where the animals lived in the Serengeti.

She said they found that female lions, when given a choice, would try
to seduce the models that had the darker mane, ignoring those with
blond hair.

Male lions, said West, tended to attack more often the lion models
with short manes or with light-colored manes, while avoiding the
models with black manes.

West said that most prides have a surplus of female adults and that
during mating season the lady lions will try to lure the males into
fathering cubs. She said the researchers discovered that females gave
most of their attention to the males with the dark manes.
