Monthly price hasn't changed, still $9.95/month. I'm still there on
occasion. I bump into people almost every time I play who either said they
came back because of the new milk and honey land or can't believe the
stories about how tough it used to be. I'll grant that some may have come in
because of the shelf price, just I haven't met a single one that gives that
as a reason yet.

Important too the low end hardware requirement. If you have a P75 with a 2
meg video card, good chance you will pick up UO over other games just
because it is the only thing your machine can run. Once again, while this is
true and has nothing to do with the ease of play, I don't run into that many
people that say anything other then "Came back when I heard about Trammel".

I really don't think this is anything other then marketing ploy or out of
the marketing department.

Right now the power gamers have a huge amount of influence in the game. Get
your level 50+ character to twink your level 5 and make all the newbs feel
like second class citizens of Norath who can't compete is the norm. I
thought it was VI<could have been OSI> publically stated that they wanted to
reduce the number of hours people felt it was necessary to play: Appeal to a
broader market.

Note that I don't come down as it being a good design or implementation. I
don't predict success or failure of it either. I'm saying based on evidence,
it looks like broader market appeal is their intent.
