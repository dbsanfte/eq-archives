Yes, had this happen last week.  I crashed at the character select screen 
while trying to log on a character in the Bazaar, and I still showed up as 
online a day later after having the computer off for 12 hours.  A guide 
escalated my petition but no good, so I had to wait for the next patch 
before I could get on again.  

This is certainly a nasty bug.
