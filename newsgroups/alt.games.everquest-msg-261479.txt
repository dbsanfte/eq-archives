I thought it boiled down to an item giveaway along the lines of the
pre-order JBoots and keeping your character's name.  The EQ1 devs probably
struggle with itemization as it is.  I doubt the EQ2 team wants that
headache right off the bat.  SOE has said that EQ2 is supposed to cater to a
different crowd than EQ1, that they want to draw in the people who played EQ
but quit.  If EQ2 offers a significant item transfer, it will mean one
thing - they don't have the subscribers they wanted and are desperate to
draw current EQ1subscribers.
