I've been playing EQ for about 2 weeks now (and loving it!).  If I
don't plan on hitting the moon just yet, is it still worth it to buy
Luclin?  Any advantages for me besides access to the moon?

As far as I know:
- better textures (probably worth it for me)
- horses? (can't afford anyways)
- more spells? (I'm a MAG)
- new character models?
- new race/class (maybe later, for now I'd like to stick with my
current HIE/MAG
