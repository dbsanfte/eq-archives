There's a much easier way to skill up!

Someone in your guild play a beastlord? Or a mage? Or any pet class
that get's the /pet hold command?

If you do, and they're nice, convince them to leave their computer on
overnight, in a duel with you. You can swing at their pet all day, and
if you're careful not to kill it, it's free skillups. It's important,
though, that they have the Pet Hold ability... otherwise the pet will
kill you.

This is much easier than other suggestions... And it's faster, too,
because you don't have to pull mobs or anything.

I did this with my druid so he could farm lower level mobs faster.
