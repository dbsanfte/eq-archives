I know, I know, don't run games on laptops.

But the thing is, for non gaming practical purposes, I'm about to go 
laptop, and there's nothing really I can do about that.

So what I'm wondering is, what should I be looking for in order to be 
able to continue to play EQ?

My desktop is a several years old pentium 4 running windows XP, and EQ 
doesn't really chug much on it, will a laptop really be THAT much worse?

I've also been unable to game much for several months each year, as I'm 
out of contact with a permanent phone line/DSL line etc.  I was thinking 
that perhaps with a laptop, I could hook up with wireless networks which 
appear to be sprouting up all over the place, in the Whataburger, 
McDonalds, etc. etc.  Sure, it won't be as simple as playing at home on 
my DSL, but is it a fat enough pipe to play one when I -can- find a node 
(or whatever its called?)
