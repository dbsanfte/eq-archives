I played since March '98 til about 6 months ago.  I'm completely sick of
Kunark and Tunaria.  I did not buy Velious expansion.  Is there enough
content in Luclin to play the new BL class from 1 to 30?  Are the Luclin
zones any good?

I played an Iksar Necro from 1 to 50 without leaving Kunark because I was
sick of Tunaria.  So if I can do something similar for Luclin I might think
about getting it.  I just don't want to go through patch hassles (especially
with a Radeon 8500 -- is it supported?) unless it's worth the bother.
