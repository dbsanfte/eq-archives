Stun also interrupts casting 100% of the time, assuming it lands (same 
assumption must be made for you to say mezz interrupts 100% of the time)

Stun also stops mob from doing anything for the duration of the stun, 
while mez stops it only till mob is next hit.

Mez causes all pets to break off attack until it is broken and pet is 
subsequently sent back in, it normally kills cleric hammer pet dead, and 
removes enchanter animations from the fight entirely.  Stun does none of 
the above.

Often its more important to interrupt a cast (gate and CHeal in 
particular) than to worry about any of those niceties, and some classes 
(bard) don't have stun available as a tool... but if you -can- pick 
between stun and mez, stun is usually the better choice for interrupting.

Splendid One, 58 Gnomage (capable of neither)
Llyric, 57 bard (mez only)
Bergh, 65 cleric, (stuns -and- bashes, but no mez)
Matte, 30 chanter (stuns and mezzes, but no high end game experience)
