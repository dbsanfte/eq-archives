    In most groups, I find only one or two tanks ever manage to attract
significant aggro. Since as a cleric you tend to heal people when they're
hurt, the cleric doesn't have the luxury of letting the mob cut through one
tank before starting heals on the second. The cleric's mana output is
whatever it takes to heal the damage inflicted on whichever tank is taking
damage.

    Your mob is dealing far less damage, because it's slowed. Your mob is
dealing less damage when it DOES swing, because you have a much better AC
than the tank taking damage in the other group. The only question is how
much longer do you take to kill something with exceptional haste and weapons
versus whatever the other group had with three damage sources. Even then,
taking a longer time is in your favour, as the healing punch of slowdowns
increases with time.

    I'm not arguing it's a change, I'm saying that Turgur is so damned
powerful that the only way VI knows to deal with it is to make mobs 100% MR
so they're challenging. If they AREN'T immune to Turgur's, they CANNOT be a
challenge.

    If there was no CHeal, there would be a series of increasing heals for X
mana. Just like every other class has their main spells increase and
increase in effiency as they level. The difference with clerics is that our
"best efficiency" spell is obtained in the 30's, not nearer to 60. As
healing is the limiting factor in any tank-centric fight, WHATEVER OUR BEST
HEAL WAS would become the "new" design factor.

    Compare to Turgur's. As pointed out several times in the past, Velketor
quads for 850. How many seconds have to pass in a fight for one Turgur to
prevent as much damage as CHeal could heal on a 6 K warrior, assuming Velk
could be slowed? Well, 75% of 850 times four is 2550. Take 70% of that
(Defensive is that percentage, isn't it?) to get 1785 damage. Give Velk a
2/3rds chance of hitting our warrior friend, and have him deal 50% of max
damage on average (to also take into account not quadding, etc.) and you're
looking at about 600 damage per normal combat round of Velk's. Pre-slow. So
after ten swings, and he normally swings every HOW many seconds, you've done
a maximum-effiency CHeal on that main warrior. Past that it's gravy. There's
just NO comparison as to which is broken. The only difference is VI has
almost no way of removing CHeal from an encounter - they CAN remove
Turgur's.

    Number of HPs isn't large just because healers can keep tanks in a fight
longer. It's also because classes like wizards can do a FIXED damage per
second to a mob. Mob HPs MUST be set higher than the theoretical "group of
24 level 60 wizards" can blast through quickly. Damage rates are high to
limit the effect of mana regen devices (so all casters DO run out of mana
and become useless), and also so the latest drops are REQUIRED to do boss
mobs. You don't kill Tormax wearing your Kunark gear - your AC is
insufficient to tank him. You NEED to camp PoG/Thurg if you want Kael, which
you NEED to do boss mobs. It's an enforced linear progression, to slow
advancement through the system.

    Was reading Noows looking for Sean's logs using Trueshot against
Yelinak, and found articles about Defenders of Ak'Anon killing Vulak by
pulling him without Vyemm. Furor and crew were pissed, because they figured
that by NOT killing every dragon in NToV before killing Vulak, VI would
start screwing with the zone until you HAD to do it that way. Because they
wanted NToV to be linear, like the rest of Velious.
