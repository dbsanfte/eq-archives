The file is called BZR_charname.ini i think and it shows everything
youve ever sold and it's prices. It also shows the prices of your
current for sale items if you saved the priced in the bazaar window.
Normally you can see who bought from you in the trader window, but with
a crash to desktop this is gone and i don't know any way to get this
informations back.
