It's true that some LCD displays are better than others, but the fact
remains that LCD displays do have a slower response compared to CRT
displays.  Whether or not the slower response actually bothers each
individual viewer is the important question.  Personally, the slower
response of LCD's still bothers me for certain types of viewing, and it's
quite easy to see the difference in side by side viewing even on the best
LCD displays.  Many people, however, just don't seem to be bothered by it.

The issue, however, is certainly not "urban legend."
