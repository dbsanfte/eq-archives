Bingo.

If Luclin hadn't been released recently, I'd have been
less concerned about the erroneous faction messages.

But given that people are still exploring an entirely new
expansion with "new" faction concerns, I think it's
inexcusable that they left the "your faction changed,
but we're not actually telling you with whom" bug in
for a couple of weeks without doing a quick middle-of-the-night
patch to fix it ASAP.
