Considering the stink that's already permiated from this change it would be
in Verant's best interest to say more than "we think that people would
rather know whether or not a particular server is up or down."
(http://www.everlore.com though I've paraphrased the quote).

or down...why change it?  They're going to have to speak up soon.
