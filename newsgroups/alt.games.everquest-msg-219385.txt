See, I read the OP's post a little differently.  I've been doing a -ton- 
of lowbie tradeskilling this month.  And I've noticed this pattern.

What you're describing there is "how it is advertised to work".  But I've 
noticed in practice, it seems to be behaving a bit differently.  I've been 
-consistently- been having it happen that when I hit the trivial on an 
item, my success rate -drops-.  Ie, metal bits, trivial 21.  At skill 0 I 
have about a 45% success rate, predicted and in practice.  I skill up to 
20, and my success rate seems to increase to about 65%, consistent with 
predicitons.  Then I hit 21... and -regularly- get about 5 failures in a 
row.  If I keep going, my success rate at exactly 21 skill on a 21 trivial 
item seems to be about 10-20%.  Which is much lower than the predicted 
66%.  If I then, say, make a file out of all these metal bits I've built 
up and skill up to 22 or 23, my success rate on metal bits jumps back up 
to the mid-60's where it should be.

I haven't been keeping careful logs of the data or anything. And in every 
case I haven't done a statistically significant number of combines, 
admittedly.  But I have skilled up a lot of characters through these skill 
levels lately, and I keep seeing it, be it with bog juice, ceramic 
linings, metal bits, studs, batwing crunchies, you name it.  I hit the 
trivial, and success rate drops through the floor. The higher the trivial 
of the item, the less it plummets, but it still seems to plummet with 
fillet of bear. I just skilled up 17 characters to 143 baking (twitch), 
and every single one of them failed the next combine or two after hitting 
143.  And this bug started happening right after that patch a month or so 
ago where they -said- they were going to make trivial stuff fail less.  So 
they jacked with the code, and they introduced a problem that only crops 
up when trivial=skill.  But god forbid anyone mention it, we might be 
interpreted as just complaining about failing so much on trivial combines, 
when they just -fixed- that.

I /bug'ed it anyway.  We'll see.  I'm sure it will get prompt, swift 
attention, like alchemy did.
