If your question is "can't a blue player duel a red player?" my answer is, I
don't know.  I do know that no matter what you do a blue player can't cast
any spells on a red player, including ports.

If you're asking if a red can duel a red, yes.  I included the words
"without consent" above because without it (/duel or in arena) two level 5s
can't hurt each other.
