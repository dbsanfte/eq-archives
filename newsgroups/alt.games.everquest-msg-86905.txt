Thinking about heading to Charasis - Howlings Stones
and wondering if someone can help with a couple questions
about the keys and the zone.

1. Is the key soul-bound?

2. Does everyone zoning in need a key or just
one group member? i.e. Is it like the ToFS and SS keys?

3. From the maps it looks like its one of those one way
in zones. Meaning once you zone in you must fight your
way to another zone out point. Is this correct?

4. From some of the web descriptions I have seen they say
that you get jumped by mobs as soon as you zone in. If that
is correct, by how many and how tough are they?
