Which is handy if you want a keyboard solution to switching your
sit/stand position... but does -not- provide visual confirmation.

A hotkey that forces /sit off would be more useful than the ctrl-s
key, which doesn't guarantee you'll be standing after you hit it.

Using the actual Sit/Stand button, though, gives the flexibility of
your ctrl-s key with the visual confirmation I'm looking for.

Again, you are using a macro for backstab?  This confounds me.  My rogue
would never think of doing this in a million years; drag that backstab ability
button over to all your hotkey banks, same slot, and you get ... yep, my
mantra...
visual confirmation.  Grey?  Backstab not available.  Pops back up?  BS time!
OK, so I really ought to make a macro /attack off, /hide, /backstab, /attack
on...
but this assumes that the BS goes off, while hide cycles faster than BS, so I"m
more likely to get another BS in should it fail using the single keys solution
rather than making a macro.

I assure you I turn to the right far more often than I hit any other one
of my macros... or any hotkey (note that many of my hotkeys aren't
macros at all, they are dragged over buttons or inventory slots.)

He was aware of this, its what he means by "F and number" keys... well, he
might not be aware of F7 and F8 I suppose.

By the way, F1 F1 targets your pet, after which F1 toggles back and forth
from yourself to your pet and back again.   My main will have to wait for
level 54 to see that work, of course... but I've got the spell sitting in
the bank!  I sure wish F2 F2 would target my groupmate's pet, but
we can't have everything, I suppose.  Heck, while I'm dreaming, it
would be sweeeeeet if F8 F8 would target a mob's pet for me!
