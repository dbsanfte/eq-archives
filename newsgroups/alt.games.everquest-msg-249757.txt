REALLY? What if I offer you $20 real money if you sell me Park Place
for $5 monopoly money. I don't recall any rules saying you cannot sell
a property for less than the listed Monopoly price, or that you can't
trade one of the rail roads for Water Works. I just don't see the
difference between buying virtual property in either game. But I don't
know anyone who would not call me a cheat if I actually made that
offer during a game of Monopoly.

The real difference between the games is that, in Monopoly, only one
of us can win so you are loathe to sell your virtual property to me.
However, in EQ, there's no single winner -- there is no point in the
game when you're out because I have everything.  In fact, I'd say in
EQ it's the player with everything that's more likely to quit as he
has done it all, while the other players continue because they still
have more to do or get. 

The other obvious difference is Monopoly has only one Boardwalk that
only one player can own but EQ has lots of J boots that every single
character could own (eventually).
