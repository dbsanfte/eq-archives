Use your brain.

VERY few people have problems like you describe. They are usually
related to the following:

1. Your PC hardware/software configuration (WinModem, Flakey NIC, Bad
driver, virus, etc, etc, etc)

2. Your ISP (Bad router, DNS problems, denial of service attacks,
maintainence, crappy equipment, too many customers overloading the
system, etc, etc)

If the problem was caused by poor coding or the EQ servers themselves,
10s of thousands of people would be complaining. Not just a handful of
whiners like you.
