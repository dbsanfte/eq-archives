Really really bad advice, the rotations on Karana work because of people
working together in cooperation. The few guilds that have ignored the
rotations have not lasted long. They should either join KGC and enter the
rotation schedule or look for a non rotation zone to hunt in as they are
doing.

BTW, a group with a level 48 enchanter along with the other relatively low
level chars would need to seek the server's help in recovering those corpses
at zone in. If they were there unscheduled, those corpses might just end up
rotting with all their equipment.

http://pub140.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds is an organization that
individuals or guilds can join for dragon and planes raids if they are not
able to do these things on their own.
