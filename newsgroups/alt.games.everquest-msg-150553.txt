Please don't take this as my being insensitive, but I simply don't care.
It's not that I don't want to care, but that part of me is numb.  I'm tired
of caring about this cause and that, I'm tired of being told to cry over
some moron's fate or another.  Something inside of me has simply turned off,
and then broken the knob.  Maybe there's something wrong with me, I don't
know.
