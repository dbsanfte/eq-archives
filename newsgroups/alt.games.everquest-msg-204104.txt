    Because the old Luclin animations were pretty much universally despised.

    It's not just a question of a clue. The background system has changed. I
get the idea that the old Beta animations were done on a race-by-race basis.
Each race was its own model, so everything was highly customized. The Luclin
player race models are all based off the same model. The body shapes are the
same, the movements are the same. So trying to make, say, a dwarf run well
might make a barbarian look like he's skipping because what is a "small hop"
on the tiny dwarf frame would be magnified to a large hop on a barbarian.

    Personally, I wish they went back to the old custom race models. It
would take a lot of time, but the results would be well worth it. In
particular, you'd recapture a lot of the unique feel of the different
race/sex combinations that made them special. I remember I used to be able
to see someone running around out of the corner of my screen and be able to
tell from just that quick glimpse what race/sex had just run by. I also
remember how much joy people would get from meeting someone from a rare
race/sex combo and seeing how they did things, like the sidearm two handed
weapon swing of dwarf and gnome women. That was lost with the new uniform
system, just to make sure people would all look OK on horses. Clue: compare
the number of people with horses to people without horses.

    So no change there?
