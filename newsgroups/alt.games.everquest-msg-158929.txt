    Maybe if they pulled some sort of crazy all-nighter, and had solid
groups throughout. It's good, but it's not THAT good.

    AoE is impossible here, as mobs are unstunnable by the PBAoE enchanter
stuns. You can quad, though - I think only one or two mobs summon. It's
kinda like Luclin that way.

    What level were these people? The best my guild has seen is two kills
per 1% regular at level 61. And trust me, we're there a LOT. And if you
can't get good XP off level 62 mobs that triple for 500 and proc a 375
DD/stun effect with a -50 MR adjustment, what's the point of them being
there? Decoration?

    They could, but it would be pointless. The real reason this is good XP
is because of the level of the mobs being killed. But Verant has nerfed the
level range someone level 64+ can get XP, so we HAVE to fight mobs like this
to get XP. And it's not like they're pushovers - taking 2000 damage in one
round of attacks, and being stunned so a second round of attacks that can do
up to 1900 can land is NOT trivial. I'm over 5000 HPs with buffs and I was
running in circles like a child fleeing a bumblebee whenever we had adds so
the mezzer would have time to put the adds to sleep (I always got aggro, go
figure). Thank Brell for the new 1.8 second, 1500 HP heal - it's just fast
enough to kite, stop, cast, and keep kiting.

    If they really want to nerf the XP, refund all PoP AA points spent and
then double the cost of the PoP AA skills. Having an AA point be the XP for
level 51 is a little low, given the raw XP we pull in, but at the same time
it's not imbalanced for the pre-PoP AA abilities. That's about the only
tweak I can think of that might correct an actual imbalance.
