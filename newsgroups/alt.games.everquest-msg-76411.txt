In a recent move, my Everquest CD's (which I was sure I'd packed) got lost,
possibly unrecoverably, possibly en route to a garbage dump somewhere.  To
make matters worse, the hard drive on my EQ computer became damaged, so I
ended up replacing it and reinstalling all my software on it.  I've also
bought a copy of the new "Everquest Trilogy" package.  Now...  Since the CD
keys for my account are different than the one in the new package I bought,
will I be able to install the software and use my account?  Or will I have
to pretty much say "screw it," and creat a new account using the new CD's?

Also, since I haven't played in about a month, how go the loading and zoning
times in the old world (EQ/Kunark/Velious)?

Thanks in advance.

Paul
