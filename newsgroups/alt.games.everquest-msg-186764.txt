I tend to assume that people know what they're talking about when they make
broad statements like
"DL has a ZEM? I wonder what they thought it was about this exceedingly
easy zone that made them decide to give it a zem."

In this case, it would be knowing that "XP = level_of_mob^2 * ZEM *
Level_Modifier * Party_Modifier" and the obvious consequent that a ZEM of
zero in such "exceedingly easy zones" means that you would never get exp
there at all.
