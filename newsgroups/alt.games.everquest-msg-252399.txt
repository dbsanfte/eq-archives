I'm assuming this is not the plat seller's first transaction.   Value could
easily be proved by showing that he has sold "pixels" in the past for
similar amounts of money.

As far as I can tell (and nobody seems to be disputing any of this) the
facts are as follows.  The "scammer" entered into a contract to exchange an
in game item for cash.    Delivery of the item did take place, but the
scammer did not follow through his promise to pay.  He only made it appear
that he had paid, then reversed the charge.  He did not return the platinum
that was purchased with that charge, but instead kept both the money and the
items.

The scammer obviously breached the contract.  The fact that he went in with
no intention of actually following through with his part of the deal makes
it fraud.  He decieved the other person into thinking he had paid when he
had not.

Other than that, the rest of this thread is a lot of wind being thrown
around about peoples opionions over whether or not he might get off due to
the wording of Sony's EULA, and thier offical (for the moment) but
completely unenforced policy.  I'm not commenting much on that, as I am not
a lawyer, and, like almost all of those discussing it, I am not qualified to
predict what the outcome would be.

In any event, using any real definition, he stole he platinum, same as if he
had hacked into an account and took it.  The guy is scum.
