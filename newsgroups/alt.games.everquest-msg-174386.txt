Well as has been said, the gold edition came out before PoP, so no it
wouldn't be included.  You don't need more than one package to enjoy the
game, and that is the original EQ.  However let's say that you want access
to more than that, Well Surprise if you buy PoP it comes with the old world,
so you can have the fast transport, and the old world flavor.

You know oddly enough, once you bought this game you don't have to buy the
expansions (they are in no way required) so you wouldn't ever need to spend
more money on the game (other than the monthly fee of course).  Now if you
choose to buy the expansions, then why bitch about the cost?
