Well, that's a trifle unfair.  I can't argue with the accusation of 
idiocy, but if my copy of the manual is any indication, they did, in fact, 
follow instructions.  If I may quote:

---
7. Type in a Sony Station login name and password.

*  If you don't have a current Sony Station account, create one by 
   entering a login name and password.

8. Click Finish.
---

Note the absence of the word 'secure' or the phrase 'that will be 
difficult to guess'.  So they _did_ follow instructions.  But the 
instructions are way lame.  Now admittedly, the instructions shouldn't 
_have_ to tell you to pick a good password, that should be instinctive.  
But this is the RoK manual... Sony/Verant should have known by then the 
average level of intelligence of their customers...

I think it would have been far superior if the manual also told us 
something about the allowable passwords.  I fiddled with it, determined 
that '$' was not an allowable character, tried a couple others, noted that 
it did not seem to be case-sensitive (although this was over a year ago, 
so I could just be remembering that incorrectly) and put together a 
password.  It's not a great password, but should be secure.  But there's 
no reason Sony couldn't have devoted a line or two of text to saying 
"Passwords should be at least X characters, up to a maximum of Y 
characters, and should include a mix of upper and lowercase, as well as a 
numeral and a non alphanumeric character from the set [fill in the blank].  
Do not  choose a word that is in the dictionary, as this is easily 
guessed."

But they didn't.  Lame.

}User stupidity is not Verant's problem.  It's the user's.  

Well, I can't argue with that, either.
