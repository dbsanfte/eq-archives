I'd say about 1 hour and 47 minutes

There is no guarantee that a SoW will prevent a need for a rez.  A rez
guarantees you get your exp back.  On top of that, 4 classes can cast SoW, 2
can port, and many others can gate, and to top that all off, those are all
spells which are attained at a reasonably low level, which means there are
many more of them around, making them relatively worthless in a PP sense.
Only 2 classes can 90% exp rez without a priceless regeant, and they both
get their rez spells at a relativly high level, 49 for Clerics, 59 for
Paladins.  That makes it harder to come by, and therefore worth more.  There
is also the negligible mana used by SoW compared to a Paladin going for FM
to 1 bub after casting a rez.
