A fear-kiting necromancer's pet will rarely get hit, so AC doesn't
matter. Weapons on the pet only matter either at low enough level that
it's not dealing more damage naturally than with the weapon (pre-16
pets unless you're finding good drop weapons. Definately not summoned
weapons...) or at that brief stage where the pet can dual wield but
needs to be given two weapons to do so. Even at the dual wield stage,
the difference is minor. Its dual wield only works occasionally.

So, equipping a necromancer's pet only makes a minor difference,
really, unlike a mage's pet that has to tank the mob...
