Apparently the Sleeper has now been awakened on Drinal by Cats in Hats.
Grats to them, and thanks for getting one seriously amazing set of
screen shots from it.

Read a few of their exploits before. They had 73 folks in ST for this
raid, pretty much ALL lvl 60 with AA stuff, etc. etc. etc.  According to
their reports, for one brief second, it looked like Kyraferm's health
bar "edged" down a fraction then maxed out again immediately.

This bastard is definitely unkillable. But man, what a ride. I also
loved their reason for it: "Following the defeat of the US Hockey team
by Canada, we set out to ensure that no Canadians would ever get Warder
loot again."

LOL!
