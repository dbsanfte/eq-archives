SWT is basically a big square (like most zones) cut in half by mountains.
The PoK book side has trainers and the entrance to Shar Vahl, the Vah Shir
Home City. Most of the mobs on that side of the mountains are less than
Level 9.

My recomendation is open the map, mark your current location with a label
saying "pok book" so you can find your way out and go exploring... it's half
the fun of EQ. When you find something interesting, mark it on the map.
