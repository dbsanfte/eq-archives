I'm curious about the SOE part of that statement...in fact, I call bullshit.

Let me get this straight: a good-race character was trying to start a group in /ooc, and
was taunted by some evil-race characters.  Later, the good-race character managed to get a
group with one or more of the evil-race characters, whom may have been the same ones which
were previously taunting him.  When the good-race character died in action, he was rezzed
and disbanded.

The good-race character should be grateful that he 1> earned some group XP for a little

I think the appropriate GM response would be, "So....you grouped with some players who
were publicly taunting your character's race, just minutes before?", followed by,
"So...you got a rezz from one of your party?", and closing with, "Do you have a map to
help you find your way to safety?"

Best regards,
