You'd be surprised. I wonder how many people have actually read their
TOS agreement.

AT&T doesn't have one of the more restrictive ones, but even so if he
is deliberately bucking accepted newsgroup rules (according to its
FAQ), he is violating terms viii and ix of his TOS (at least, they can
be interpreted that way if people chose to complain).

Like I said, he's got a lot to learn.
