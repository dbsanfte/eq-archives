Not in our guild / groups / situation.

Recent days have included, 2 goes at grinding in RSS (first real time I've
done any major xp there on my warrior), several goes at the Unrest mission,
several goes at various DoD spell missions 68.1, 68.2, 68.3 (failed a few
times), 69.1 (normal and hard), 69.2 (normal), some relaxing hours spent in
MPG, a few DoN missions, couple of epic 1.5 fights in various places.  Many
of those groups were with mostly guildies and one or two pick-up people.  I
tend to do pickup groups more on my wizard and I've not played him for a
while.

I've noticed a rise in the camping of normal xp locations over the last few
weeks on Fennin since the changes to the MM xp.

Not saying it's fine everywhere, but certainly on our server, on the time I
play, in my guild, grouping isn't in the slightest dead, and we rarely do
monster missions unless someone needs a piece of loot.

MPG had about 30 people in it on the way to RSS a day or so ago, and RSS
had four groups going on Fennin.  That's back to how it was, or close to
it, before DoD was released.

We include some Ssra targets once a week in our guild on Fennin, although
we've not done any for a while.  We're a family guild who has optional
raids once a week with friends from other guilds.  We're doing pretty well
considering, the aim of the raids is to have fun and show people stuff they
might not see otherwise.

Enjoy.

[just replying to provide counterpoint, for some people and guilds, the
game is as healthy as ever.  i can honestly say, without any doubts, that
I'm having more fun in EQ now than I ever have, and it's not killing
shrines in fairy missions]
