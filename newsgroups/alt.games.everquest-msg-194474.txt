I did it today with 22, I've heard it trivials at 26, I'd say if you
have the time/patience (And if you are doing beastmaster quests in Shar
Vahl, you have the time and patrience. ;) ) to get it up to 40 or so. 

And ye GODS do they need to fix those quests. It took me /6 hours/ to do
a newbie quest that has no great reward... Took me from level 4 to 7,
though.
