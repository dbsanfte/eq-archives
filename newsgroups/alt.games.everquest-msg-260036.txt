>> Where's Richard Lawson and his wonderful storytelling gone?

Richard has been playing City of Heroes but is still playing EQ. He, my wife 
and I used to adventure together in Paragon City and had a great time as 
superheroes (he plays a primary healer there as well).  I think we started 
playing together around level 8-10, and when I left the game all three of us 
were level 32. The last I heard from him he was level 38 and still climbing 
(cap is 50) and had joined a guild there.  Although he still raids in EQ, I 
think he spends his "fun" time (his words) in CoH. But he's still around.
