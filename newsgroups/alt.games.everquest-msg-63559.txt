  Sure, but your can make the same argument for anything.  Rusty chrome
bumpers and chipped and faded paint on the exterior of a car may not make it
run any less smoothly, but it certain will decrease the value of that car.
People are vain and want to look good.  There's no reason why EQ would be
any exception.

  The main thing that EQ has going for it that other MUDs don't is the
visual aspect of it.  If you play EQ, you want to see the world around you
and you want other people to see your avatar.  Most people don't want their
avatar holding something that looks as ridiculous as the necromancer epic
weapon.
