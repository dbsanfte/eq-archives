If mana is low, this tank hybrid don't expect anybody to be doing anything.
I sit and med for a bit.  I feel it's better to sit on my butt for few mins
than dying from adds.  But..... if you don't feel my ranger is worth the
mana to clarity then you ain't worth the trouble to keep in my group, I am
usually leader because I hardly ever go LD and everywhere I go people are
such sheep,they stand around shouting instead of picking up the monk or mage
that's been shouting for the last 10 mins.

Rangers have more to offer than tanking:  we can snare so the mob can't run
off or after us if we have to bug out; we can fear animals so that mana
doesn't have to be wasted on heals;  we can plink things with arrows if we
have enough- some summoned arrows would be nice in groups;  our heal sucks
but I have saved people from certain death with my crappy 29 pt heal;
stinging swarm rocks- 116 DoT but 65 mana cost; ignite for when you feel
like giving the mob a hot foot too;  taunt isn't that great but I've saved
my cleric by snare taunting.  Lots of things I need mana for.  Lots of
reasons for you to automatically give me clarity when you give it to the
healer.  Sometimes the only thing that keeps me from pulling is low mana.  I
don't pull if I'm not confident that I can handle the mob without the group,
I've had people go LD on me way too often.  So don't be so hasty about not
giving out buffs.
