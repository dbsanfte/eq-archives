I'd tell you which one I use, but then I'd have to kill you.

I used drop and log for ages, but on several occaisions had people pick up my drops in the interval between logging
one character out and the next in.  I also on a couple occaisions had momentary trouble logging back in, long enough
for what I'd dropped to decay.

I've only had something taken out of a tradeskill container twice, and one of those times it was taken by someone who
was using the container, the moment I showed up he asked if I'd left something, when I was able to tell him what it
was he handed it right over happily... just needed the container to work in.

Containers don't work to drop containers, sadly, so bags still have to hit the floor or find someone to hold them.

Cash can no longer be dropped at all, but I generally get around that by buying gems and handing those over via
container instead.

Using a friend to do trades is obviously preferable, but when this sort of thing goes on a couple times a day, thats
beyond tiresome; I just don't have 24/7 access to people who happen to be online and handy to my two characters.
Unless we are talking several Kpp in items, I can't be bothered with finding a confederate for this sort of exercise.
