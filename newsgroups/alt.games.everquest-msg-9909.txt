After the recent changes to certain food items left them with varying
degrees of longevity and/or stats, I thought it would be a good idea
to work on my baking skills. All of the recent talk about upcoming
food-shortages from vendors has added extra impetus to this skill and
I thought I'd share the method I used to very quickly get to 135 (a
long way to go, sure, but zero -> master in one evening is a damned
good start).

Fish Rolls.

Combine 1 piece of fish with 1 batwing in the nearest convenient oven.
The beauty of this simple recipe is that the components are freely
available.

As a DE, I chopped up pirahnas in Nek Forest for a while, and
batwings... well, anyone who has raised a character from scratch
should know where to get batwings from ;)

Failing that, if you want higher volume at a faster rate, the
components are available in infinite quantities from vendors. Batwings
from a vendor in EC, near the zone to WC. Fish, from a vendor at
pretty much any port, but the barbarian huts in NRo are nice and
convenient.

Not only can you raise baking quickly and cheaply, any successes you
manage will produce a banquet-sized meal! An amazing recipe to see you
through the longest of famines which may (or may not) be coming ;)

A friend estimated that fish rolls last about 2 hours, meaning that 1
stack should last around 40hours!

Fish Rolls become trivial at 135. After that, you'll have to find your
own way upward (assuming you want to take it further) and presumably
at a more sedate pace :)
