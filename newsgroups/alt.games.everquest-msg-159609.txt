The only top post that makes any sense is "Me Too"

"Fixing the post" is funny... here's an example of "middle posting though, I'm
replying to the thought where it occured.

Drenched in flames... I like the juxtaposition.  THIS is how middle posting
works.  See how it refers directly and easily to what was said?  Now put this
into the context of a 300 line post.

this would you?
upside down like
write your letter
after all you wouldn't
Top posting is illogical;

Bottom posting is little better, although its fine for short posts where your
reply is to a single thought.  Middle posting puts your reply to each thought
directly under the material you are replying to.  This is really the only reason
you'd want to quote material at all, since otherwise, the reader could simply
page back to the post you are replying to.
