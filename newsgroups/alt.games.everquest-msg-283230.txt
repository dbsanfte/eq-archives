The problem is that $99 offer was a one time ONLY offer.  It would
have been auto renewed at $99 a year if you didn't change anything
with credit cards (this includes current address) and still have valid
CC.  If you changed anything for any reason or even cancelled payment
then restarted, $99 is not offered again. :(  Any lawsuit isn't going

I don't know why some people are up in arms, 2 years subscribtion is
under $200, the same as $99 one year offer.
