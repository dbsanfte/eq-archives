Because?

Because you utterly totally fail to comprehend what I was talking about 
in our little discussion, so you see this as vindication of your point.

But in fact its quite the reverse: we moved with full mana, got in a big 
mess, survived it ONLY because we had full mana.  Then we pulled the 
single remaining mob while low on mana, because time was running out.

Your way, we would have died before even thinking about pulling the 
final mob.

And it was always my contention that the mana was there to be used; that 
in the end game section of the run I'd happily run out the mana bar.

One more time, Faned plan: enter the dungeon low on mana, pull low on 
mana the whole time.  Splendid plan: enter the dungeon full mana, stay 
relatively full mana the whole time, spend down to low as time runs out.

Both groups spend the same mana per minute, on average.  But Faned group 
wipes when things go wrong, Splendid group lives.

Its very simple, and I'm sorry I explained it again even now, because 
I've gone over it far too many times.  Getting a new computer wiped my 
kill file list, I suppose I'll have to start a new one.

Splendid
