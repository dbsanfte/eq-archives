I have an extremely likely solution already, I just need to get the specific
revision of the NVidia driver that I need to use to work with DX8.  I'll
have to ask my friend to get that for me, or call VI tech support, and pray
that I get someone as helpful as he did.  As I stated elsewhere in this
thread, he had a similar problem, and actually had it solved by VI tech
support, he went to a somewhat older NVidia driver.
