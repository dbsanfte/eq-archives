No, they are not.  They are in fact somewhat worse at DPS than
warriors if you don't count spell output, SK are apparantly
competitive if you allow them to cast damage producing spells but
they still aren't in the realm of "real" DPS: rogue, ranger,
monk, beastlord, mage, wizard will all certainly outdamage them
significantly, and druids who are playing nuker or necros who
aren't too busy being mezzers and twitches can probably outdamage
them too, not to mention enchanters or bards with pets.

Knights have their advantages; paladins have stuns and heals and
Pacify, SK have... well I"m never sure but they seem real
effective, plus they have FD.  DPS isn't really one of them.

I agree here, Enchanters are the premier mezzer but Bards and
Necromancers make good enough substitutes and have their own
advantages.  Clerics are the premier healer but shaman and druids
make good enough substitutes (at some levels) and have their own
advantages.  Tanking should be like that; warriors should be the
best at it but the other two should be close behind and have
advantages of their own.  Formerly Warriors were so much better
at it that you'd hardly ever take a knight instead, now knights
are so much better at it that you hardly ever see people taking a
warrior... plus warriors don't even "have advantages of their
own" to make up for being worst at aggro management.

Yes indeed, the fix as I see it would be to increase warrior hate
and sponging capability... but the danger is that if you do it
too much, then you end up back where you started with knights as
tied for a distant second place, unwanted and unloved.  It has to
be a close call.  Yet I still want it to be three different
approaches, not three cookie cutters.

Because the mana is there to do so.  KEI and mounts and beasty
crack and so on are major villains in this story.  Nobody wants
to sit around FM, and if you take away the ability to use mana as
fast as its coming in, then all three tank classes will get
dropped from exp groups and the casters will find another way. 
Ever do PB AE groups?  Or play Hate Kite?  Or Mob Ping Pong?  If
the tanks can't hold a mob's attention, then we'll do away with
the tank concept.  Your dream of a knight taking aggro and a
warrior taking it off the knight is also a loser, because it eats
up a second of your six precious slots and gives it to a non DPS
class.  This slows down the kill significantly, already there may
be only two DPS in the group if you have seperate mezer, slower,
healer, tank... cut that down to just one and you increase the
time per kill by half (only half because the two tanks are doing
-some- damage, just not a lot compared to the real DPS person you
replaced).    Now if the warrior lets you spend the same amount
of mana on kills, just forces you to do it more carefully, then
he will make an acceptable substitute for a knight; if you also
give him better mitigation and HP then he'll become preferred as
he'll save healer mana while not slowing the kills.  Getting that
balance right is the key though, go too far and suddenly nobody
wants Knights, don't go far enough and you'll still find nobody
who wants warriors.

If the DPS people have to sacrifice 10% or 20% of their DPS, then
they aren't playing effectively after all.  Admittedly getting
killed would be ineffective, but still, to play at their best,
their tactical choice is not to slow down but to get a knight
instead.  Ineffective is picking a warrior!

What you are seeing is someone who has the mana to cast three
nukes per minute, and spacing out the nukes so as to allow the
warrior to retain aggro, while with a knight he can cast them all
in 30 seconds and not have to worry.  This is the balance for
boss mobs; wizard is going to blow out all his mana either way
and the mob is still standing.  But in exp groups, which is the
problem we are discussing, the wizard can cast three nukes in 30
seconds and kill the mob, or cast them over a minute and have the
mob live twice as long.  The warrior's advantage in HP and AC
doesn't mean much if he's allowing the mob to live twice as
long.  And often the wizard has the mana to cast 6 nukes in a
minute but with the warrior can only get away with casting 5;
mana regen going to waste there.

There should be a Robert's Rules of Order for the Web; snipping
anything you aren't responding to is never inappropriate!
