------------------------------

This patch fixes a number of issues that first arose in yesterday's patch.
We apologise for the additional downtime.

- Zones should be considerably more stable.

- Item links no longer cause display lockups.

- NPCs once again choose their targets properly.

- Gravity Flux-type spells again function properly.

- The Guildmasters of Sanctus Seru are no longer quite as mean as they
were previously.

- Ring of Flamewarding is again wearable by Wizards.


Thank you for your patience, and have a good weekend!

- The EverQuest Team


Hmmm doesn't say anything about chat channels. =(
