Gah - try being based in Ireland where a 6PM PST raid is 2AM in the
morning.  Damn things never get going for at least another 30 mins /
hour and by that time it's hook me up to a caffeine drip or it's off
to slumberland...

Having said that I've never fallen asleep totally...I've nodded off
for a few seconds at a time.  The adrenaline boost from lagging behind
your guildies in a fast-popping zone keeps you awake...for about 5
mins, then it happens all over again.
