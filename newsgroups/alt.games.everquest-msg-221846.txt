Assuming these are both 1 handers, I would take the Ornate every time. 

In formulating optimum weapons, ratio is the prime characteristic for your 
offhand. For your primary, you really need to find the compared modal of 
the weapon, which takes into account the added damage of your primary hand 
damage bonus swinging more times per minute.

Modal: The modal is the figure one reaches by the following equation 
Primary: WeaponDamage * 2 + DamageBonus 
Secondary: WeaponDamage * 2

Compared Modal: The compared modal is the modal of a weapon divided by it's 
delay. This figure is a good measure of the weapons efficiency. 
Primary or secondary: Modal / Delay
