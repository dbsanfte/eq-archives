You'll still have your spellbook regardless...

And if you tell it to go to your spellbook, then by gosh
it'll still go to your spellbook.

What changes at 35, and may have changed in the last patch
for all levels now, is that you can just do a normal "sit"
and you'll still regain mana as fast as you do in the spellbook.

In order to see whether that's been fixed, you'll have to
do some mana regen timings while sitting, and while in the
spellbook, and see if they match.  Previously, just sitting
(pre 35) would regain mana much slower than having the
spellbook up.

If you don't need the spellbook to meditate any more, then
just get in the habit of doing a "sit" when you want to
meditate instead of popping up the book.
