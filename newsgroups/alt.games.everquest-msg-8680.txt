Ok, lets hear the excuses/deals/arguments etc you give to your non playing
partner when you miss dinner or roll into bed at 3:00am


Here are some of my best:
"Group kept saying a little longer, little longer and before I knew it 2
hours went by"
"We all died and spent 30mins getting our corpse back.  You don't want my
corpse to rot do you?"
"But honey, I only play after you go to bed (can substitute work, store,
mother's house etc)
"I can do ok on 3 hours sleep, I'll find a nice place to nap at work"
"You should play... A cleric doesn't really have to kill something and you
can make alot of friends"

Gotta be careful the last one doesn't backfire and she becomes more addicted
than me, but as of yet, she doesn't want to play hehe.
