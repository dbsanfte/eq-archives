I think its great when a certain class is highly desired in a zone, outside
of the usual 3 (cleric, warrior, chanter).. especially something fairly
unpopular like a Paladin

I'd like Flurry, Rampage, 100% critical mends, and a 100% fail-proof FD..
ain't ever gonna happen though.

Actually I'd like slow and crit nukes too.. you don't hear monkly-business
getting into a frenzy though about "what a broken class" we are.  (As it
happens, FD is our best skill.. and still has several big bugs with it...)

Druids can already do a *lot*, so Im having a hard time doing anything other
then laughing at the dr00ds posting on this thread bitcing that druids need
fixing..  you would think an easy class to play/level, a class superb at
soloing, walks into groups, and serves a raid purpose, would be damn
satisfied !
