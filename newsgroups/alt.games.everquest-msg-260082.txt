Good point, and it serves true in the world they live in. But when they 
go to a new land(game), there is no map, the sextant only tells them 
where they are in relation to some place they have been and already know 
about, it won't tell them what's new out there.  The compass leads them 
through the new land and helps them keep track of where they're going, 
but they have no idea what's in store for them ahead, swamp, valley, 
desert, nice furry bunny rabbits or needle sharp toothed rabid badgers.  
But the lovely radars in SWG, Ryzom, etc. do.  

I also agree that some things shouldn't be completely frustrating, but 
supposedly the game is trying to take us from reality and put us in their 
world, like a good book.  Handing us some things on a silver platter just 
takes away from that experience, for me at least.

I wish there was a way to make these games without beta testers, so that 
everyone would be running around experiencing the bewilderment of being 
in some place so totally new and exciting. No web sites with maps, codes, 
charts, hot spots, etc. ready to print out. But obviously that's 
impossible.
