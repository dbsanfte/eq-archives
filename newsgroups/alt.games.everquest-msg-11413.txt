Glimpse has a 12 second recast delay.  Try Sense Summoned.

I've found that abjuration usually maxes out pretty quickly just from
normal use.  In fact, I've seen abjuration get ahead of evocation. :-)

It's faster to alternate Fade and Shadow Step, since they both have 5
second recast times.

Might want to alternate with Halo of Light.  Note that the only Wizard
spells that use Conjuration are:

	Eye of Zomm (level 8)
	Halo of Light (level 12)
	Eye of Tallon (level 57)
	Flaming Sword of Xuzl (level 59)

Don't worry too much if you forget this skill. :-)  Consider that Halo
of Light will only be used until you get a better head item, or get Heat
Sight at 16, and that the Eye spells are meant to be useless (according
to Verant, they were *not* meant as scouting spells, and whenever
someone finds another use for them, it seems Verant nerfs it), so that
leaves just the Flaming Sword.

So, if you think you are going to reach level 59, *and* you'll actually
get the Flaming Sword spell (it's a Kunark dropped spell, so probably
very hard to come by), *and* you actually find a use for the Flaming
Sword, then maybe you'll want Conjuration.  Personally, I'll wait until
I'm 59 and have the spell, *then* consider getting the skill up. :-)
