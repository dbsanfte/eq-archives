    Snip the log, but it says it all. If ST is #2, ST will be flattened
before healing can shift to him. With AoE Taunt being 100% effective,
there's no reason for a warrior to stay high on the hate list.

    We used Nimble tanks on AoW. By moving close to him you can pretty much
assure yourself of being top on the hate list as long as you've been doing
strong damage, and monks qualify there. The monks also have the advantage of
being able to survive after Nimble drops, and of having an offensive /disc
that doesn't deal as much raw damage as Trueshot or Duelist.
