I'm not quite sure if #7 is saying increase mana regen by 2 per tick
or what. If it is, then it's essentially an FT2 and extended
enhancement focus rolled into one, which would definately make it
better than shawl 7. If, however, that's saying something different,
then it'd seem that 7 is better to me.
