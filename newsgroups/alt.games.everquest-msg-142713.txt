A lot of enchanters hang out on caster's realm's enchanter forum.
http://eq.crgaming.com
It's not an enchanter only board area but it is traditional kind of because
it is what used to be eqenchanters (or something like that).

They don't have an AA specific board but if you search the topics you will
find a lot of AA information.

Or you can ask here, many good enchanters hang out here. And also enchanters
like me hang out here too. ^_^
