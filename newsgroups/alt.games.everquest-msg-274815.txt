Claiming that an hour of setup was required before PoK is assinine.

In EQ1, before the PoK fucked everything up, people somehow managed,
and somehow still had fun.  Often, you ended up grouping with people
nearby instead (gasp!  being forced to *meet new people*!), or you
bought a teleport (gasp!  the concept of fast travel at a price is
simply *outrageous*!), or you asked a guildie for a teleport (gasp!
asking a friend for a ride is *unheard of*!), or you did something
besides grind exp (gasp!  there was more to EQ1 than grinding!).

Shocking, I know!

Does instant gratification offer the best long-term enjoyment?
