I have substantial anecdotal evidence to support my position.

I played a mage for a long time and never carried food or water.
Upon entering Norrath, I would summon 20 food and 20 water.

When I spent time in Oasis, it was very obvious that water was
consumed about twice as fast as normal.  Also, my party members
would ask me to summon water much more often than other zones.

I think you need to accept the reality that water is consumed
faster in some zones.
