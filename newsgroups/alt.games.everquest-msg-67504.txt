Ok, the shaman want to sit and med, I, the SK, pull. I'd like to have some
ideas where you can effectively duo, as I only have full group experience.
Are there nice places with solid respawns, where one can sinlge pull? Either
standing spawns or a more or less densely populated area near a safe spot.
I thought of giants in WW, or some mobs near LOIO zone in FM. But giants
hit hard for the level and the FM area is not very debsely populated.
What about Ice Clad and the snow cougars? Or is LOIO Sarnak roamers
still good at 30?
