	It is all/all.  It is surprisingly rare to find one for sale at E'ci's
bazaars; there's not much traffic in SolA (never was even pre-Kunark and even
less now).  I imagine that most of the people who go there for one do it for
themselves or a friend.  It is Lore so it is difficult to pharm.

	The High Shaman, as I understand it, is not a particularly rare spawn; the
GSB is his common drop.  It would probably take a 40-ish group to get some
GSB's with reasonable safety, since SolA is loaded with casting mobs.
