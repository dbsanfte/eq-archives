Definately 45 (and well equiped). You can hold the camp and handle the
Minos at 50. At 45 it can get tight if/when Raster spawns and you get
a Mino add from a wanderer or when Raster runs when low on health.
Since the PHs are Minos and live frogs you will trash your faction
with the minos long before raster spawns. (32 hours and 96 PHs before
he popped for me)
