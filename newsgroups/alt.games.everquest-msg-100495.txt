Ok, this is just my opinion, but you know what I'd gladly pay $3 more per
month for? A company that listens to me when I have a problem with their
product, and seriously tries to help me out. Not a company that tries to
blow me off and send me a form e-mail when I have a problem, charges me to
call them with a problem, and brings out new expansions that do little more
for me than make me go LD a lot more than I used to.

Let's see, Verant will make (according to recent numbers) an additional
$1,260,000.00 per MONTH on this rate hike. Gee I hope that covers their
crappy service.
