Hehe, you people are just insane. Here i am, trying to help people from
getting screwed over, and you're worried about things like punctuation. You
snip the post for no obvious reason. On top of that, everyone that has read
this so far are all ignorant fuck heads, that obviously don't give a fuck
about nothing.

Hey! Let me make this very clear, get a fucking life assholes! When its your
turn to get screwed over, don't say I didn't warn you!



There, isn't that much nicer?
