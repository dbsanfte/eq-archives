You are talking about a fairly trivial level of hunting. As mobs get
harder and you explore more and look for certain kit you are going to have
to deal with other people. While anyone who bitches to Verant about camps
is going to get laughed about (ie there is no real world intervention and
limits on how much people can do if you choose to stick to the baseline
rules), there is a player convention formed about camps. To effectively
operate at higher level you will either have to a) buy into the idea of
camps to some degree or other, b) be prepared to operate alone as you
increasingly irritate groups of people (ie suffer in game in character
censure, not out of game) or c) guild up with a bunch of people of like
mind to provide the backup you will need at higher level should you choose
to take the view that you do not want to buy into camping.

The biggest issue with camping is various people ever try to extend it and
abuse it for personal greed and the arguments fly....basically most if not
all people I have met agree there needs to be some form of system just the
details vary....small differences of courtesy based systems are guaranteed
to cause real BIG arguments.
