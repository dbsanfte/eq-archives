 I feel you pain. Tell us a little about the character you've chosen, 
what class specifically. Each is different.
 
 Basically, if you're a caster, memorize what spells you are given
and ask how to use them effectively. Kill the easy stuff first of
course, staying near the guards and run to them if you think you
will lose the fight, they will kill the baddy for you. Try to stick 
to bats and decaying skeletons and loot the bat wings and bone chips 
and save up stacks of 20, you can sell those to higher level players 
for some fairly good platinum, they need them to cast certain spells. 
Then buy more spells for your level that will help you kill faster 
and easier. 
  
 If you are a melee type, keep your skills maxxed and get a good 
weapon using the advice above. It gets easier, don't dispair. Ask
for help from other players, most are willing to help you out, 
there will, however be a few people that won't be friendly to newbies
but don't let them discourage you. Avoid begging from other players, 
you won't get far that way. If you have wings or bone chips to sell
you will be able to auction them off eventually. You may also be 
able to sell spiderling silk to those working on their tailoring.

 There are also many web sites that you can learn a lot about EQ
and starting out. http://www.everlore.com/ , http://eq.castersrealm.com/
http://www.eqatlas.com , and http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ are 
a few places to start.
