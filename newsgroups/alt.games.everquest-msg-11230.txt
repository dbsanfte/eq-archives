Actually, he used both a Colt M16 CAR .223 rifle and a FN SLR .308 rifle.
And neither were "assault rifles".  An actual assault rifle would
be fully-automatic.  And yes, I'm aware that a lot of the media,
and countless government flunkies, speak of "semi-automatic assault
rifles".  They're wrong.  That's as much a contradiction in terms
as a "four-wheel-drive motorcycle".

"Were told" -- nice use of the passive voice to avoid having to
name a source.  Care to cite the alleged expert?

Whoever it was, they're wrong.  And I'll bet you two dollars
that the source was a person or organization that has been
advocating more restrictive gun bans all along.  Lord knows
when "authorities are told" something similar here in the US,
that's always who it turns out to be.  No one else has a
motive to lie so bald-facedly.

He certainly would have been able to do the same with a pump 
shotgun or a lever-action rifle, give or take a few seconds.
They're a lot faster to reload than you'd believe, and both can
be reloaded at any time, while there are still rounds left in 
the magazine, so even a short lull between shots can be used 
to "top off" the magazine.

A revolver could fire just as fast, but is of course slower to
reload.  On the other hand, any nut wanting to kill a lot of
people rapidly could just bring several pre-loaded revolvers
with him, if by some miracle no other sort of firearm was
available (and they ALWAYS are, no matter how draconian
the anti-gun laws -- for the same reason that any high
school kid could buy cocaine if he wanted, despite a nearly
worldwide ban).  Bryant used two rifles, and had a combat
shotgun in the trunk of his car, it's no stretch at all
to imagine him bringing rucksack full of revolvers instead
if by some miracle an earlier "semi-automatic ban" had
magically been more effective at reducing availability
than, say, Prohibition or the War on Drugs had/has been
in making alcohol/narcotics unavailable to anyone who
really wants them.

As for a bolt-action rifle, that would slow down the rate of
fire a bit (but not a huge amount, the "20 killed in 90 seconds"
would have been no problem, so even if "12 in 15" would be
impossible, I can't say that that's really any improvement).
As for reloading, a lot of bolt-action rifles can be fully
reloaded within seconds by the use of "stripper clips", so
they're almost as fast to reload as rifles with a detachable
magazine.  For that matter, anyone handy with tools could
rework a bolt-action rifle to instead take detachable
magazines.

>weapons by most people in Australia.

Yes, I'm well aware of that irrational, useless, wasteful,
hysterical overreaction.  I know personally many firearm owners
in Australia who were really screwed over by that "gun witch hunt",
not to mention all the Australian taxpayers who had to shell out
a HUGE amount of money to "buy back" countless firearms and
then pay to destroy them.  And the irony is that any nut in
Australia that would like to reproduce the Port Arthur incident
will be in no way inconvenienced.

It's like trying to put a lid on arson by confiscating lighters.

Tell me, if some nut takes a Ford Explorer and plows through a
schoolyard, killing a few dozen children, will Australia then
forcibly confiscate and destroy all SUV's in the country?  It
would make about as much (non)sense as their "solution" to the
Port Arthur tragedy.
