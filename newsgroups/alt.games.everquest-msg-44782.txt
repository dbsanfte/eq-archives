It's interesting to note that no MMOG really has a thief/rogue class/skills
that is well implemented.  Most MMOGs only offer a slice of opportunity for a
thief (how many locks are there to pick in Norrath? 4?).  UO went the other way
and initially made thieves too good through the unbalanced Stealing skill.  AC
requires one to be able to pick locks to get into the deep end of the dungeon,
but that is about it for thieving skills.
