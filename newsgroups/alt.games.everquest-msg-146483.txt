I was under the impression that the level limit in groups was the lowest +
50% of his/her level.  So a 20th can team up with a 30th and still get xp.
But recently my 31 bard teamed up with a 20th and he still got xp.  Did the
rules change?

Also, I was told you have to be 45 to get xp with a 60.  If the previous
rule applied, you would only have to be 40.  Any know more on either of
these?

Thanks!

Rom
