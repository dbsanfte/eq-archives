True, but it is a time sink that reflects a normal reality.  Getting from
point a to point n should be harder than getting from a to b.  But, with the
PoP books, some place in n may actually be closer than a place in b, even
though it's on the other side of the world.  You don't have to earn that
distance, say by being the wizard capable of gating to the location.  You
just have to go via the PoP.  My character is a wizard.  I can beam myself
to the moon, but I still carry a stick to defend myself.  To me, that's a
bit of a mental disconnect.

Of course, if I were the designer, there's a whole lot of things I'd do
differently.  But, I don't work for Sony, so I guess I'll just play.

Cheers,
Eric
