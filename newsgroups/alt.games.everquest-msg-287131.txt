A couple days ago I went to POF to help a warrior get his 1.0 drop off a 
golem.  Golem died, iksar broodling popped and also died (I'd have left 
it up, but we had a full group and someone was in a killeverything 
mood).  No shaman in group or guild needed the drop so I looted it in 
case it came in handy later.

Yesterday, someone advertised in general chat for a Childs Tear MQ. 
Well what the heck, I had one, lets see if it can be done.

I went to BB, killed Peg Leg, aggroed the Lesser Spirit and ran him to 
the POK book without hurting him.  Meanwhile, I had my bot also move to 
the BB POK book.  Bot cast a dispell on him to aggro without hurting 
him, I FD'd and stood up, back to Amiable (I'd gotten to Amiable for my 
SK 1.0... using this same trick).  Said his trigger phrase "I wish to 
know more" got tiny gem, used POK to get to freeport and handed it to 
Bondl for a Truespirit faction hit, repeat for an hour till max ally.

Talking with the shaman in question, he hadn't actually started his 
quest at all, was just looking to reserve the hard part, and planned to 
contact me in a couple days when ready.  Nonsense, I had him come over 
and do the same thing I was doing, since it was already set up.  He got 
to max ally well before I did, since Gate saved half the running and his 
machine zoned faster than mine... also may be there is a bigger faction 
boost for a shaman than for an SK, it seemed he only took 7 runs from 
ally to max ally while I took at least 12.

At any rate, I knew much of the quest was just faction building, looked 
it up while doing the running... and it looked like nearly ALL was 
faction building.

Incredulous, we nonetheless set out to test it out.  Over to COM we go, 
and after a few false starts found a note on Alla saying that the best 
way to do this was to go up the elevator, which meant going up and 
killing Neh'Ashir.  Having done this before, I had no trouble using levi 
and pony to bypass the one locked building in the way, and was able to 
go thru the final locked door simply by flying thru it at pony speed... 
this doesn't work with other doors but for some reason does with this 
one... ok, I fell thru the floor and had to fly around for a second go 
at it, but simple enough.  I couldnt get Neh'Ashir to follow me back out 
thru the door; most mobs can go thru locked doors but not this guy it 
seems.  So I killed him inside, got his temp key, and back down to the 
base of the castle

Elevator up, killed the three BR who were there, the third popped Lord 
Rak.  Killed him, got a rez for the shaman (7 minute rot time on Rak, 
this was a panic) he looted the scale, and ran off to do the hand in.

Under two hours play time, start to finish for the shaman.  If you want 
to be precise, I guess you could add in another half hour for the time 
from when I entered Fear to where I looted the tear... but to me no time 
was spent on that at all, since I wasn't there looking for the tear but 
just happened to loot it rather than let it rot.

When did SOE merge with Staples and start selling the Easy button?
