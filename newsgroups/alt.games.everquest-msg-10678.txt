[All real examples of my begging experiences]

John Doe shouts, "can anyone plz give a lvl 1 warrior some pp so i can buy
some armor!!!????"
/ooc go kill a rat

John Doe says, "Excuss me, can I please have some plat so I can buy my level
1 spells?"
/say Why do you need plat to buy your level one spells? Just go out and kill
some wasps and you'll have enough money for all of them in like ten minutes.
And will probably be above level 1 by then too.

John Doe tells you, "Excuss me, can I please have a Breeze?"
/tell john I'm sorry, but your begging skill isn't high enough.
John Doe tells you, "Oh well thanks alot! See if I give you a sow when I'm
old enough to give sow."

Anyway, I don't mind the begging. I just think it is sad though. The first
time I ever played I played at a friends house. Got a character up to like
level 8 or so. Very newbie. After that when I started my first real
character, I didn't even talk to anyone until like level 5 or so. The only
thing I ever requested at low levels was a bind somewhere.

Anyway, if more and more people just beg, then eventually there will not be
any more people to just give stuff away, and then all the beggers will die
out. Natural selection.
