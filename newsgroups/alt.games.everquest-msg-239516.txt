My expectations  were a lot higher for SWG then it was for a virtually
unknown european company.

Hello... Lucas & Sony worldwide corporate heavyweights  vs Funcom (fun
who what now?)... nuff said =)

That SWG would be so bad was shocking, really.

It may not have been the worst launch of all time... but it is the
launch that most failed expectations (hmmm... kinda like the new s-w
movies... maybe its not so strange after all). 

Personally I'd like to see Nintendo do an MMRPG... I think they would
do it right.
