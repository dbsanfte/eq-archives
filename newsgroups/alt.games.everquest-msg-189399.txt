I'm running the trial version of ZA Pro now (which is NOT free if you
register it. Cuts off after 30 days if you don't). The freeware
version of ZA didn't have this problem. The reason I checked out the
pro version is for the pop-up blocker built in. So far, it's the only
one I've found that doesn't stamp out new browser windows that I
*want* to see along with the pop-up ads.

Anyway, does TPF block Red Sheriff without having to do manual
configuration (Red Sheriff is an irritating spyware thingie. Only way
I've found to stop it from installing is to turn off cookies, which
creates other problems... Honestly, spyware should be illegal when it
installs itself without the knowledge, much less the approval, of the
user...)?
