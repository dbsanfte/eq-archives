Actually you got a few things incorrect.

989 got the idea and hired a group of people (actually the
visionaries) to do a MMORPG.  Some of the people they already had,
like a couple of 3D programmers and a few artists.
 Not far from release, as is common in gaming, the group split off
from the mothership and formed their own company (Verant), which 989
continued to allow to produce the game.  What are their options
really?  Who else knows what to do with the game if they all bail?
Then the game hits the streets and HOLY CRAP Batman!  How much money
is being made.
Sony realizes they never should have let it go and wants to get it
back.
The Sony group best positioned to re-acquire it is SoE.  So they
strike a deal.
Verant goes away.
Followed shortly by the talent that brought you EQ in the first place.
They then formed Sigil.
The rest of the story is yet to be told.
