Nope, you still have to do all the parts you ever had to in the past,
just they added new parts.  Now when you hand in to the guy in Sol
B you don't spawn Ragefire, you just get a different item back (swirling
Pearl)

Then you go to Skyfire, where you used to have to wait for Zordak
to spawn.  Instead, you gather four pearlescent fragments, get a box
from the warder, combine, hand back to her, to spawn Zordak.  This
means instead of waiting an average of 5 days, you can get everything
ready and then have a maximum of half an hours wait, and that you
can spawn zordak only when you are ready to do so, instead of
playing beat the clock, or doing a race against some other group
trying to beat you to the fight.

The quest is now longer, in terms of what you have to do, but
far far shorter, in terms of how long you have to wait to do it.
