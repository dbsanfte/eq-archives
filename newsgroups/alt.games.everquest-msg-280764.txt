He does not give a *single* source which can be verified.

When you read articles in your newspaper about economy,
you always know where the numbers come from,for example inflation
rate,unemployment rate or the number of sold cars or condomes is found
out by reading governmental publications or publications made by 
companies or their organisations etc.Nothing like this on his site.

I repeat ,he does not give a *single* source where he has his numbers
from.
