Barm's Tips for Melee Management
There are times during your career as a shaman that you'll find yourself
grouped with those crazy melee type classes. I offer the following tips for
working with the gate-inhibited:

Melees are poor at math and don't understand that 20 mana is less than 100
mana, thus they keep pulling. You can help the tank visualize your mana bar
by keeping his health bar at the same level. Some warriors cannot comprehend
this either and pull anyway. This is called natural selection.

Paladins get a very annoying ability called Lay of Hands that they carry
around like a personal get out of death free card. They will happily pull
Venril Sathir to your right courtyard group confident that LoH will save the
day. It's imperative that you "fizzle" a few heals, forcing them to burn
this right away. Now, your group is relatively safe from your pally for one
game day.

Monks get a similar ability called Mend. They tend to be more selfish in its
use, so make a hotkey saying "Monk, please cast MEND on %t." and click it
every two minutes. If they try to claim they can't, tell them your brother's
16 monk can Group Mend. Then accuse them of being ebayed.

Tanks think all casters med at something like 500 mana a tick. When you
report your current mana they, despite being poor at math, mentally tack on
another 30% to compensate for .003 second delay your message spent
traversing the internet. To correct for this, subtract 30% from all mana
reports. This is called the "Scotty Principle".

Rogue twinks are your enemy. They join the group with 15 hit points left
dual wielding 10/10 weapons that proc Insidious Taunt and immediately demand
haste. You cannot afford to heal rogues. Give them something with a boot
icon -- Scale of Wolf for instance.

Many people do not understand the Ranger class and think they are like that
dirty, unshaven guy from Lord of the Rings. Nothing could be farther from
the truth. Rangers actually follow very strict principals of honor like
Shaolin priests. Under their Bushido-like code, nothing brings more shame
than being healed by another. Pat Morita explained this all at the last Fan
Fair. He did say they were kinda dirty.

Keep your pet alive over all other group members. You can justify this by
explaining that your 55 pet costs 50 mana more than Reviviscence. Be warned,
they will try to confuse the issue by pointing out that you can't even cast
Reviviscence. Go into a long dissertation regarding the concept of
"community mana" and the respect thereof.

If melees ask for strength say something like, "Yeah, that would be sweet --
maybe this drolvarg will drop it?" [Optional] Then cast Maniacal Strength on
your pet.

Some shaman suggest casting buffs on yourself or a pet as timers so you know
when to refresh. While this may sound good on paper, it does not factor in
the warrior who clicks off each buff every few minutes trying to check the
names.

Don't get angry at the tank who responds to your "OOM" with "haste plz".
What they really mean is, "Hastily get thyself to the zone while I buy you
precious second with my unworthy life's blood, Good Priest." It's just hard
to type all that between the crunching sounds. Respect the dying request of
this proud roleplayer.
