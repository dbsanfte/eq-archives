It's unfortunate that whoever gave you the bag didn't warn you about that, but
it is currently a "normal" part of how the bags work.  My Magician will usuall
remind anyone who wants a bag not to keep anything valuable in them.  On the
other hand, the bags are quite useful to me when I'm hunting in areas like Cazic
Thule, since I'm not strong enough to carry much Fine Steel on my own.  If I
manage to drag it out and sell it, yay, and if not, well, I couldn't have
carried it anyway without the bag.
