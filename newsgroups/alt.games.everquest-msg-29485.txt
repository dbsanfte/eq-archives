Example 4 is an annoying one .. In melee battle, I'll notice myself getting
knocked a tiny bit away from the mob every time he hits me. Eventually, I'll
get the "You can't reach your target." message and have to scoot forward a
bit.

The annoying part about that is VI *supposedly* fixed it so mobs couldn't
hit you if you couldn't hit them. They forgot to carry the 1 or something,
because it's still happening.
