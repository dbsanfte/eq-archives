If I go to the trouble of writing a FAQ I always start a real newsgroup.

In alt.games.everquest's case there already is rec.games.computers.everquest
which I'm sure someone put a lot of work in to.

This attempt at a FAQ (it's not a bad FAQ btw) reminds me of some Johnny
Come Lately attempt to repeat what's already been done.  Why not just put a
hyper link to the ORIGINAL FAQ and give it the RESPECT it deserves?

 So I'll go right ahead and hold my opinion.

Thanks and have any kind of day you wish...
Just saying
