Very easy this one. This is caused by insufficient physical system memory
which is causing your machine to use virtual memory (space on your hard
drive) in lieu. The hard drive is much slower to access than physical RAM so
the constant pauses.

Putting more RAM (if possible) in your system will fix this problem.

Note - this is very different from pauses unaccompanied by hard disc access.
