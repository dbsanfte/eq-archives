Tismaks got me from 30 to 34 in short time as a Druid.
There are a few camps, so you can get in some groups for
some fast xp.  Theres also enough wandering Tizmaks to
keep a solo-minded druid busy for a long time.
 In addition you should be able to make enough
 money to buy all your level 34 spells.

Thats about all I have to say about that.
