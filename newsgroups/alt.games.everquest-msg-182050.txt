Nice selective snipping. here it is again:

What, then, are you saying if this isn't a "pot, kettle, black"
statement, hmm? This is an OBVIOUS statement that you beleive that
because I play an online fantasy game and write about playing a
computer game, I am an ubergeek who never sees the sun. There is
nothing else you could have reasonably been saying with the above
quoted. Now, be adult enough to admit that you fucked up rather than
trying to dodge and shift people's attention off track. Really, you're
only emberassing yourself.
