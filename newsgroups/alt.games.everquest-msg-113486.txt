I've made sooo many runs without sow.  It can be rough, but in my few months
of playing I have only asked one single person for a sow.  I was in the
middle of nowhere on a long run and saw a druid.  I didn't want to ask
because the /ooc or /shout "need sow plz" spam I've seen in every single
zone I've ever been in has made me glad I've never made a druid.  If you
must run fast all the time, be a bard or a druid or don't complain.

Next time someone won't sow you, you're in luck!  With this patch they fixed
the /cry emote.  Maybe you can just sit down and exercise that for awhile.

Sean...
