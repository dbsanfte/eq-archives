Tigana is one of Kay's stand-alone novels, along with A Song for Arbonne
and Lions of Al'Rassan.  He also wrote a trilogy (cross-over fantasy thing)
called the Fionavar Tapestry.

There is a marked difference in style between the trilogy, the three
stand-alone books, and the Sarantine Chronicles.

I must prefer Tigana / Arbonne / Al'Rassan over the Sarantine stuff, and
prefer them all over the Fionavar stuff.

Kay's prose is unequalled in fantasy literature IMO, and his ability to
bring his characters to life puts him ahead of virtually everyone else in
the game.  His books are truly stories about people, which happen to be set
in rich wonderful worlds, but the story is the primary focus.

Tigana is still one of my most favourite books to date.  The emotional
intensity is incredible, although it is surpassed by Lions of Al'Rassan in
that respect.
