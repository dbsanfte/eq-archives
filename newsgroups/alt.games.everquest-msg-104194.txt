I mean that anyone who doesn't step foot in dungeons til level 50 is going
to get themselves and everyone around them killed.  You know those regular 5
minute trains in Karnors?  Blame these idiots.

Due to the fact that those zones are the easiest to find pick up groups,
they tend to have the highest idiot rate relative to any other zone
(possibly excepting EC).

If you've waited til level 50 to visit a dungeon, you'd better have some
friends who are willing to put up with your complete lack of skills.  And if
you have friends that good, you guys should've gotten your idiot asses OUT
of the cycle and visited a dungeon.

Dungeons are fun, exciting, and risky, with commensurate rewards.
Outdoor grind zones are boring, tedious and almost completely safe, with
commensurate rewards.
