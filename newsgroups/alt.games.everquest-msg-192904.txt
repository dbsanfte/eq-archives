It's possible that a certain mob will quit giving you exp halfway
through a level. seems to happen a lot at lower levels when you're
hunting borderline mobs that just barely give exp. 

Dunno exactly why it happens, my guess is that when comparing whether
a mob will give exp they use your actual exp vs. the exp value of the
mob.
