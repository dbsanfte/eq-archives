I was at a friend's farm this past weekend with the kids, and there was 
a Smith there putting new shoes on several ponies. We got into a 
discussion and I asked about this very thing. He said that in 40 years 
as a Smith, the worst thing he'd seen was a person blinded in one eye 
because he didn't wear eye protection. He said there was no way to kill 
yourself unless your were the type that could kill yourself in any 
situation. In other words pretty careless. I'm sure Lance could speak to 
this much better than all of us.
