Depends on how your newsreader treats killfiles.   Some go by name, others
by e-mail address.   Changing both was probably what escaped him.

Eh, it's not a problem from today.  The class bitching is actually way way
down from what it used to be.   Back when Brad was posting in this newsgroup
occasionally, we would have one of these threads a week.   They would be
serious too, where I suspect this one is at least half troll.

Its what happens when you have a system where you choose at character
creation which class you are going to be, and then have to spend hundreds of
hours building your character in a changing game.  Whether recent changes
have made your class less fun to play or not, due to the immense time
investment, most feel that they can't just reroll and start over.  So thier
only recourse is to complain until the issues, real or imagined, get
fixed... or until they learn to live with the game as it currently stands.

Not that this means Ubernuker isn't a putz.
