They did.

Buy a shovel from the merchant in the fort.  Dig up all of the graves, 
fight the one to two mobs that spawn from each grave as you dig it up.  
Once you have cleared all of the graves, you can then safely do the final 
fight to get the last sigil.  Nothing else will agro on you.  The mobs 
you saw agro were all the ones the Necromancer (that is the final 
encounter) summoned from the graves.
