Get yer Paineel faction to Amiable by whacking Kobolds in the Warrens.
This will probably take about three evenings of mass carnage.

Then, the Paineel guards will give you a Key to the City. Use the key to
figure out the elevator (hint, put key on pointer, face rock and hit U).

Explore the city. Since *everything* is on the same faction, nothing
will try to kill you. The building in front of the bank is a general
store. The lady there sells something that looks like a small bag, but
is in fact "A Hole Key" and I bought it for 136pp. Verant lies and
thinks I'm ugly.
