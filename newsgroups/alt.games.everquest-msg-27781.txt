I've got a GeForce2 GTS 64MB on my 900 MHz Athlon system.  It runs
great.  Even the worst part of Warslik's Woods is no problem.

A friend just upgraded his system to a 1.2 GHz Athlon and a GeForce2
MX 400 64 MB, and his performance is almost as good as mine in EQ.  He
gets a little slowing in the worst parts of WW (both of us are running
1024x768).  His card was only $140 retail...and can probably be got
for less (he bought where he was getting his MB/CPU/RAM).

The MX is a great deal.
