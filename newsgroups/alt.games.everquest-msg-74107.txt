You will not evade me, "Orlun" <brinkchad@qwest.net>:

*grin* I pondered evac and their lack thereof on the first screening,
and thought "Train to zone!" on the second :)

>Since I play a dwarf, I am even more proud of my race now.  "No one tosses a
>Dwarf!"

My guildleader is snowed in with his girlfriend. Two consequences:
they have to share one computer, and they can't go see LotR, so I
can't 'toss' him yet...

>one question I have... What is the AC of a mithril chestguard?  That was
>some pierce the thing deflected, hehe.
 
Mithril Runed Tunic: 10 ac, and the damned thing looks like *leather*.
Elven chainmail tunic: 14 ac.

>one real question.  Is there any reference to mithril before LotR?  I don't
