You don't *need* to buy them to do it. If you choose to, you can find
some recipies in there (sort of) to follow. Or you can save your money
and visit Lokari's tailoring guide.

http://www. lokari.net/

(I think that's spelled correctly, but I'm sure somebody will correct me
if not.) All the recipies you need will be found there.

Another option is to save up your silk swatches in stacks and when you
have a backpack full, to auction to sell them. Particularly with all the
again renewed interest in tailoring since PoTC quest came out, you'd be
shocked what kind of plat you could get for a good backpack full of silk
swatches.
