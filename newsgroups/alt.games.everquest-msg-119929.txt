Just a little trick I learned for this case. Always cast a throw-away buff
in the first 2 slots
of any party members before buffing them. Then they can discard these 2
buffs (invis and
see invis are good ones to use) and if they get debuffed, the spells will
land in the first 2
slots. Then when you cancel magic, it will get the debuffs on the first try
and you won't
have to take the buffs down to get to them.
