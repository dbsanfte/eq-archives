    Multi-group raids with folks that need the AC increase that Thurg quest
armour gives. What's your AC, again? =)

    So with Turgur's, all the regen you likely have, and your AC (not to
mention single pulls), a cleric which I'm betting has some FT/MC can melee a
lot. How will that apply to a cleric on the roleplaying server Firiona Vie?

    Ah, the cleric also has one of the top three cleric post-epic weapons,
one which procs a group heal and likely does so fairly often with the
shaman's DEX buff. I know what you're trying to say - I've been in those
groups where everyone is meleeing because the mobs are so outclassed - but I
don't think this is going to be relevant to someone who has never had a
character over 30 and who is playing on the roleplaying server.

    I've pulled Seb before. As long as you don't get too big a lead on stuff
you're ok. MoK actually gives a cleric a better chance to single than
somebody with an arrow/shuriken. If stuff catches up, you have DA/DB. Once
you're back at the group, you can use root and stuns to set stuff up to be
mezzed or tanked. If you wanted to be really silly and let the cleric tank,
they could use root proximity aggro, stuns, and some of the few high-aggro
weapons available (Sprinkler of Spirits, Club of Ice Ocean) to hold aggro.
Hopefully they'll also have some of the silly cleric haste toys (Ssra
shield, Cloak of Piety).
