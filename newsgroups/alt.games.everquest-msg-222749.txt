OK, how about for 99% of your EQ life you won't need to be able
to target a specific mob that can't be targeted via either F8 or
assist (or good old reliable "escape and wait for it to hit me")

Druids can't Lull pull, or Rangers can, your pick.  But in my
experience, most people playing those classes still don't do much
lull pulling.  And when they -do- lull, very often its not
because they are pulling, but rather because the puller says to
them "lull my target".  They assist and lull and now the puller
knows exactly whats been lulled and what hasn't.  Of all the
above, I'd vote necro for the job if it wasn't for the fact that
they are limited to undead, because a failed lull with a bad
reaction is pretty disasterous on a large room; FD would be a
handy thing to have.

The setup for this was "once you get things set up".  Dragging to
the hotkey box happens a couple dozen times over your character's
life span, using the hotkey instead of clicking is a constant
action (in fact for my cleric, clicking either donal's boots or
thurg quest BP probably is the single action taken more than any
other in the game, including CHeal.)

Apparantly you can type /target [name]'s corpse to get the body
targetted.  I still say this is a pretty lame workaround, more of
a "if you can't target the body with the mouse try this" than a
real solution.  F8 is at least a single key solution even if its
clumsy and sometimes doesn't work at all...
