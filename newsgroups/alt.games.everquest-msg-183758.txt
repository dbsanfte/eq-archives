By understanding how to get skill-ups.

On average.  But that's because you're fighting several at a time.
Each of those mobs is beating on you for a relatively "normal"
amount of time, and each attack they make is a chance for an Offense
and a Defense skill-up, as well as the other passive defensive
skills.

Partly.  It's also because they don't lag all that far.  When the PLee
has fast weapons and is hasted and has AGI and DEX at 200+ the skills
come along.  It's not the same as tonic'ing to L30, where the PLee
never meleed a mob along the way.
