I don't know. I kind of see it as similar to becoming a grand master
in a tradeskill. Getting to 200 is not necessarily easy, but the
average person can attain that without their primary focus in-game.
However, getting from 200 to 250 *really* requires a level of
commitment and determination that makes it a worthy goal.

Same goes for the 60s levels in my book. If you do attain level 65
with huge amounts of AA, becoming one of the best of the best, it's
gonna be quite an accomplishment.

Curiously, if so many of the mobs are so low to you, then wouldn't
they be more appropriate to the high-50s crowd?
