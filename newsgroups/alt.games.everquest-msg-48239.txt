I totally agree with this. My guild is all passing me by because I
prefer to take my time exploring off the beaten path and getting into
dungeons instead of riding the Kunark Experience Treadmill. The other
day I helped a guildie get her Investigator Badge and I snuck into
Splitpaw on a mission to try and rescure Brother Hale from the gnolls.
He's apparently converted one of the gnoll prisoners to the worship of
Rodcet Nife, which was something I found to be interesting.

In the end, though, there's  no reward for being an explorer. There's
no way to advance yourself by doing quests. In fact, if Verant finds
that a quest is actually handing out decent gold and/or experience
they usually nerf it. They WANT you to play the game by "adventuring",
i.e., going out and killing stuff. All that aside, there's still no
way to make a meaningful impression on the world at large. Hell, on
Firiona Vie they even went and nerfed a whole bunch of the standard
newbie quests in the starting towns. They don't want you to get exp
and coin by delivering messages for the bard's guild or taking a
reminder to Deputy Tagil. They want you to kill rats, bats, and
snakes. If you ain't killing stuff then you ain't "adventuring".

Back in the days when I had the time and inclination for pen and paper
games, I played TORG. The notable thing about it was that West End
Games included a results sheet with each module. The GM would note his
group's results and mail it back to WEG by a certain deadline. WEG
would tally the results of these individual groups and then make
changes in the published game world that reflected the trends
appearing in the individual playgroups.

Verant ought to be able to do something like that for Everquest. There
ought to be some sort of questing that changes the world in some way
if it's done enough times by enough different people. Hell, it
wouldn't have to be something permanent. It could be something like
the 10th Coldain Ring. Suppose that two Generals appear, one in
Kelethin and one in Crushbone. Each calls for the downfall of the
other's race. If the corresponding General is killed enough times by
evil/good races then his counterpart invades. Evil players could try
to trigger an orc invasion of Kelethin. Good players could try and
trigger an invasion of Crushbone with subsequent ransacking of the
treasury there. Eventually, if Crushbone was invaded enough times, the
Orcs just wouldn't come back and the elves would setup a new outpost
there in their place.

At least the death and destrucion would MEAN something. It would be
too much to hope that they might actually run a non-destructive quest
of some kind that could result in a meaningful change in the world.
