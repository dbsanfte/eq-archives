The lack of 1st person view is stupid. When they first create something that
great, how on earth did they want to not implement 1st person perspective.
Seems like a design flaw.
Apart from that, the game is great, although it lacks the multiplayer
playability of EQ. Some people introduced a Camera HAK that enables first
person view, which they said made the multiplayer playability better
(although that is something the designers should have done ages ago).
