You're asked twice.  Once at patching and the 2nd time around the login
screen (give or take a screen).  Even if it bombed you out the 2nd time once
you answer the question you won't be bugged again until the next patch
(unless you do the necessary steps to avoid being bugged again) so it's not
like you're being seriously inconvenienced if it bugs out.
