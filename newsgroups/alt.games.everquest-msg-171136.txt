OK, I have played EQ for about a year, but really do not know anyone on the
server (I do not play that consistantly to know anyone).  Because of this, I
generally solo (never have actually been in a group before).  Does anyone
know of a good place for a level 27 Rouge to solo?

The reason I have not grouped is mostly because I am only on for an hour or
so at a shot...I do not play every day, and that makes it more difficult to
get to know anyone.  It is a little intimidating to answer the lfg messages
as I have never been in one before, and at level 27 people kinda expect you
to know what you are doing (grin).

Let me know any suggestions.

Thanks.
