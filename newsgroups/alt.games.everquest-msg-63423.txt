The list is here:

To get on it all you have to do is have your pearl in hand.  When you get
nearer the top, you'll be expected to keep Nagafen dead, and the fire
giants if you want to.  When Ragefire you'll have 3 hours to kill him or it
goes to cleric number 2 and they have three hours, and so on.

And no comments on Overking, we've been down there twice, and we've had to
coffin out twice. :/  At least we killed him before the wipeout this time.
