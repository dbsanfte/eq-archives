It's been years since I've killed those, but here are the tips I can 
remember...

First of all, be sure you're in the right room - in each of the 3 basements, 
you want to set up shop in the second to last room, with the human 
valorians.  Don't bother with the rooms of undead armors - some are 
unsnareable and others summon.

Upon arriving in your camp, if there is a sentry up, leave him and his buddy 
beside him alone until you've cleared the other 2 pairs in the room first. 
FD split the snareable pairs and kite each along the back wall.

So you've killed 4 valorians, and now there's a sentry and normal one 
(guardians? forget) at the last doorway.  Snare the guardian and FD once 
they're both moved from the doorway, then stand up once the sentry resets at 
the door.  Kite the guardian down.

For the sentry, it always worked best for me to use the diagonal line in the 
room for kiting.  Use the direction that won't bring you right beside the 
first repop.

 ____|   |____
 |      x    x  /  |
 |x           /  x |
=         /        |]
 |s     /        x |
 |    /              |
----------------

x's are where they spawn.  Let's say the sentry was at position s.  You will 
have killed counter clockwise from the right, and will kill the sentry last 
along the dashed line, instead of along the safe wall or in a rectangle 
pattern.

So, how to kill the sentry.

#1) focus effects.  Get affliction haste
#2) have a sow potion and be sure there's enough time on your SoW to kill 
the sentry before you pull (I seem to recall having to buy Run4 during a 
sentry kite when my SoW wore off lol)

For those not in the know, sentries are unsnareable.

So pull with saryrn's kiss, since it has the longest cast time.
Cast funeral pyre while he's running for you, then run to the opposite 
diagonal once he gets close. Sick pet on him. Once across, stop quick and 
cast blood of thule, then back to opposite diagonal and cast horror.

As soon as horror lands, stay at that corner and run the sentry in tight 
circles, staying just out of melee range.  Why do this?  Your pet can get 
many, many more hits in when the sentry is only moving in 10 foot circles.

When the first of your dots is close to fading, start running corner to 
corner again and reapply as needed.  Once all dots are back on, go back to 
the tight circles.  He should die as that round of dots fades, and you'll 
have a minute or two until the first kill repops.  With practice, you can 
kill the 6 in your camp room and the other 2 or 4? in the last room before 
the first repop.

I always found the sentries really fun to kill :)

OH... and another thing that will SERIOUSLY speed up your killing in 
there... get dire charm AA.

You can bring once of the little undead squires from the lobby down to a 
basement without agro if you really want to :)  Just means you can't FD 
split anymore, but kiting 2 (or 4) valorians at a time is more fun.
