Dear Sammy,

We regret to inform you that your character  did not meet the requirments of
the Jelly Leg Red Eye school of the overly internalized school.   Please try
again next year.  Here are a few pointers: close all doors, windows, blinds and
curtains, never run when you can walk, or walk when you can sit, with this he
just may make it next year.

Somtimes Uber is goober.
