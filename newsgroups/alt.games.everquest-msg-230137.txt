    253 is the raw skill number. Since nobody has shown parses on EQTraders
indicating a difference between 250 effective and 252 effective skill, I
cannot say with certainty that this acts as 250, 252, 253, or some other
number in that range, so I call it 253. There are skills where being above
the normal maximum cap has some effect, like Archery and Backstab, and
skills where it does nothing, like warrior Taunt, so until there's parsing
done one cannot conclude that 252 is the modified cap.
