Let's put it this way, since I started playing in May of 2000,
I haven't bothered to buy or play anything else.  Even the
copy of "Zelda: Majora's Mask" (N64) which I received Christmas 2000
has seen ten minutes of play total (and I loved the prior Zelda
games, Ocarina of Time, was stunning).

You can also try out EQ for free for a month by going to
www.everquest.com and clicking on the "IGN" logo on the lower
left.  They'll send you an account key, and believe you can
still download the 640MB game files (presuming you have
a fast internet connection).

As for graphics, note that all the player/armor graphics
were seriously upgraded with the Shadows of Luclin expansion,
but you'll still see the "old" models if you start with a
pre-Luclin EQ setup until you add the Luclin expansion.

But frankly even the old graphics were still pretty good, and
I'll take content and gameplay over eye-candy any day.
