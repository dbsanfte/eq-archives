Wizards are arguably the most powerful soloing class out there once you
get out of the low levels, and as you say they've been beefed up not
nerfed, this tends to break down your "actively killing solo" arguement.

Solo (and small group/duo) play is a way to generate lots of exp fast,
group and raid play is how you get serious equipment.  Increasing your
character's power level comes from a combination of exp and loot
work, which might arguably make wizards the premier class of the game.

As a cleric, I can get groups easily, raids even easier, loot is easy to
come by  (so much so that I laugh at people offering me hundreds of
pp for a rez, and request a good drink instead) but exp is quite tricky.
I can't really solo efficiently (and yes, I have done quite a bit of soloing...
but I said -efficiently-) and any raid group I'm in has at least 1/6th
of its potential damage output nerfed (cause I'm healing instead of
damaging, which oddly counts for hate but not for which group gets
the kill,) meaning I only really get exp in a group format, which means
spending some time forming up, deciding where to go, so on and
so forth, while at the same time turning down pleas to come help out
on this or that raid instead.

If I could solo well, and port myself around from zone to zone to pick
a good uncrowded hunting spot, I'd be 60th level by now... or by
the end of the week anyway!  Druids, which share this ability with
the wizards, don't -also- share the desirability in raids or groups.
