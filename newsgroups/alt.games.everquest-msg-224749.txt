You must wait until level 20, but from then on you can do LDoN.

You need groups of at least 3 people, no more than 7 levels apart, 
there's rumor that at the low end you need to be even closer, perhaps at 
level 20 you can't have anyone higher than 25 in your group... but I 
can't confirm that.

AFAIK there's nothing really that you get with LDoN other than the 
ability to do LDoN runs and get the benefits from them; unlike other 
expansions with the maps, or added bank slots or POK port capability etc.
