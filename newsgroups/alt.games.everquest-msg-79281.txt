As an aside (and probably needing a different topic
altogether), will guards help with the Vampyre
Assassins in Katta?  Was lucky enough to solo
the one that I've ever seen (which entailed a lot
of post-fight bandaging and sitting on my duff)
for no loot....next time I'd rather just run 'em to the
city folks so I don't have to waste 10 minutes healing
up from half.
