    Well, since I posted a "I don't think there is enough interest" message
in a.g.c., I got a few polite "you are mistaken" type replies.  Looks like
we do have enough to make a go of it.  I'm going to get my defender up to
10 this weekend, and put it together either today or tomorrow.  

   I just have to figure out what colors I want.  I've threatened Lavender
and Canary Yellow.
