Easy question: Has anyone actually parsed out Berzerker DPS at level
65?  What was the result and what was the weapon and buff situation?

I have a general idea, just doing quick parses while playing, of the
kind of DPS that different classes will do for the average player.  I
was just wondering where Berzerkers fit in here.  Are you getting
around 100 DPS with your Windblade or your uber fine steel 2hs?  90? 
120?
