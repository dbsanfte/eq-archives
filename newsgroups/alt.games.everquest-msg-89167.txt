As a monk that uses disarm as a poor man's taunt, and from a higher level
ranger's perspective as well, disarm won't get you killed.

Oh, you'll still die.  But it won't be disarm that does it.   :)

With disarm's low skill cap, you will so rarely perform a successful disarm
that it will quickly get moved to the 10th hotkey bank, if you even keep it
as a hotkey at all.  It's one good use is stopping dual-wielding...  except
that even that is broken.  As far as I can tell you always disarm primary
weapon, and that doesn't stop dual wielding as now the mob is punching and
dualing a weapon (maybe I've just been unlucky).  It does stop the
dual-dagger delay problem, since mobs actually do acquire the speed of the
weapon they use.
