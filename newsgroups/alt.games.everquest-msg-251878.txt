While I agree with you on most points...

This is the one area the Cray could do very well. Graphics processing is 
*highly* parallel... a suitably programmed cray might be able blow an 
ati x800 out of the water and leave it miles behind. Sure the ati will 
compute any given half-dozens pixels faster than the cray... but the 
cray can do several thousand pixels in parallel.

The end result in theory could even put a cray x86-EQ emulator ahead of 
a real pc, if you could get the IO moving fast enough.
