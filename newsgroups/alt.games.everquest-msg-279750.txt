Meanwhile the benefit to the rest of the game is substantial. The 1-
groupers won't perceive a huge gap. Encounter tuning for 1-group content 
will be easier for Sony. Everyone is happy. 

If the raiders could be assured of a critical mass going forward I think 
it would be worth it. A little short term pain as the guilds reinvent 
itself with people who like raiding minus loot whores.. but given the 
entire server population to draw on, coupled with long term gain... 
running guilds without loot whores will remove a big chunk of the BS in 
raid guilds. :)

If that's true I don't see either group really missing each other much. 
Nobody ever complained about it in Velious onwards...

Yeah. Its hard. Might be 'less hard' with the entire eq population to 
draw on, and with only people who want to raid for its own sake showing 
up though.

Long term, its what is going to happen anyway. EQ isn't growing anymore. 
And as it gradually shrinks we'll need more server merges to maintain 
those critical masses.
