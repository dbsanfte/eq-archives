I'm well aware of that. I was referring in particular to the instance of 
slavery that I believe Wolfie himself was thinking of, which was slavery 
in the US; I just didn't think the qualifyer would be necessary.

My facts are straight, my wording was piss-poor. Apologies for that.

Hm. I would like to see some examples of that. Try as I might, I can't 
quite see how the US being the world richest and most prosperous country 
can be construed as "paying a horrible price". Many of the European 
nations which also participated in the slave trade seem to be doing 
quite nicely too.

I tend to lump (perhaps wrongly) Hebrew, Christian and Moslem under 
Judeo-Christian, simply because I don't know of a better, more inclusive 
term for all three "Abrahamite" (is that a word?) religions. I'm not up 
to speed on the situation of gays in the middle east, but if it is as I 
think it probably is, I would consider it as supporting my position.

Certainly, as well as people had every right to oppose civil
rights in the fifties. As to whether my opinion is wrong and
misinformed, I suppose that will have to remain a point of disagreement.
