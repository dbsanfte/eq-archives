     I would not make a warrior from a race that couldn't slam.
That's Ogres, Trolls, and Barbarians.

     One of the few advantages Warriors have over every other
class is they're the only ones to get both Bash and Dual Wield.
But there are only two ways to actually benefit from both:
pick a race that can Slam or do tedious, risky, and against-
the-spirit-of-the-rules inventory shuffling throughout every
single fight.
