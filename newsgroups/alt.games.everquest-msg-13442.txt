Most people learn in Programming 101 that actually testing your code
before release is a good thing.  Were I to release coding like this
into our production queue on a continual basis, I'd be fired before
the month was out.

The following is why they should not be allowed to program OR script..

Right.. Verant's script for this was SO BAD that that the guild
somehow triggered the Sleeper (with incomplete graphics), which then
proceeded to kill off its own Guardian.  This in turn set off a bunch
of other scripts across all zones in the game.

There was at least one GM watching the whole time, and all he had to
do was pop up and remind them that their tactics were questionable and
might be subject to review.  Instead they sat back and hoped that
their shiny toy guardian/sleeper would spank the guild down..  And
promptly got all pissy when it didn't happen.

If Verant would not release unfinished and untested content, would fix
the "exploits" they know about, and publish a list of remaining
exploits so people know what sh*t not to step in, then it would go a
long way towards improving situations like these.

However, the guild is correct in stating that the tactics used were
known, used and UNPUNISHED for quite a long time in a variety of
situations.

The specifics change from incident to incident.  The lack of
professionalism in the updating and support of a codebase with over
300,000 users is maddening.  And the punishment handed out to their
paying users is often knee-jerk and extreme.

On a personal note, I am currently only staying in-game because of the
people I've guilded with.  Soon, a portion will be moving over to
Anarchy Online, and I'm already set to test their beta starting next
week.  Because of Verant's history and reputation I've already decided
against upgrading to Luclin, unless something extraordinary happens.

Good luck to us all.
