That one's a cop out. If we are going to stipulate logically
inconsistency as possible but beyond our comprehension then we might
as well not bother. For all arguments can take that road: the universe
is made of cream cheese; its just beyond our intellect to understand
how it could be made of cream cheese without us being able to detect
it...

No. Complex systems do not inherently make things *unpredictable*.
Complex systems are simply not usefully predictable because errors in
the initial approximation and accumulated through round-off during
iterations of the system rapidly  grow to the point that it overcomes
any significance of the results.

If the universe is strictly causal and an approximation is perfect,
and there was no round off error accumulated the result predictions
would be perfect and accurate. Complex systems *are* theoretically
predicatable even though its impractical to actually do it.

I hope not :)

Quite.

But if there are things that can happen or not happen strictly of
their own volition at 'random', then they can happen or not happen as
an act of will too.

If things can only happen as a direct consequence of the previous
state then an act of will (if it could truly exist) would be helpless
to do anything but what the previous state before it dictated... all
the way back to the beginning.
