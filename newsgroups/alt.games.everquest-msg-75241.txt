You are about ready to hunt in Oasis, stay out of Ill Omen until about 20
then head to Overthere and solo near the water and you will do very well.
The money will not be good in Oasis but the experience is.  Just be
constantly aware of what is going on around you with SGs and Spec trains,
and while you will die some you still will get enough xp to make it worth
while.  As for a weapon Reaver is fine, true it is slow, but when it starts
to proc it will do wonders.  As for armor Fine Plate is about the best you
can afford for now, but bronze is more in you price range.  What you likely
will do for awhile is mix bronze and banded, because of the weight factor.
Another possibility is go to the moon and buy Brigantie Bronze from the
vendors there is it fits you and offers any advantages.  While in Oasis use
fear sparingly as there is too great a chance of passing adds and inevitably
anything you fear will run into a ravine and that is deadly as ghouls and
other surprises tend to pop up there.  Basically fight close to the NRo zone
line group when you can and always keep you back to the zone so you can see
what is coming.  With patience you will do quite well and find that when you
reach the 20s you DE SK will become much more enjoyable.
