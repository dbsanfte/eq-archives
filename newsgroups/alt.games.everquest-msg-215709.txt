On Tunare, at least, there are plenty of Enchanters doing LDoN.
Clarity II (11 mana/tick vs. 14/tick for KEI) is a L52 spell, it's
what I've had on my 55 Paladin 3 out of 4 adventures.  So, I'd say
if you aren't prebuffed with KEI be sure you're grouped with mana
regen casters, either an Enchanter or a Bard plus either Beastlord
or a 59+ Druid and you'll be ready to contribute.  I've seen Wizard
rain spells used to excellent effect when the puller (me) was doing
a good job of bringing singles (that mission we all had KEI, but no
secondary mana regen boost from Druid/Bard/Beastlord).

OTOH, if you have a group that is seriously lacking in DPS the kill 50
mission can be a bitch.  We had Wizard, Cleric, Enchanter, Shaman,
Druid, Paladin in Tak, got off to a slightly slow start (Shaman zoned
in by accident and started timer before we buffed) and just couldn't
quite kill fast enough to make up the lost time.  I think we'd have
done fine with a kill the boss but the group leader (the Wizard) was
determined to do a kill them all (or if we'd gone to a dungeon with
undead in it, would've boosted the DPS contribution of the Cleric and
me noticeably).

Caveat:   the above comments are from the perspective of a L55, it might
be a lot different for 61+ groups.
