here's my problem:

Been playing EQ on 2 comps for over a year now and suddenly 1 is having 
a problem. The one in question is a AThlon 750....512MB ram and a 
GeForce Nvidea MX400 32MB card....no sound card ( and never had one ). 
Well up till last week all was fine, always played well. Last night I 
went to log onto the test server ( where I was playing Thursday with 
same comp ) and all goes fine till I select the server...then I get a 
black screen of death and have to reboot.

So instead I log onto regular servers and play...logs on fine and played 
all night and left merchant on when I went to bed. Well because of patch 
I wasn't on when I got up so tried test again just to see and same thing 
happened....then when servers came up ( for the short period of time )I 
tried to go to the live servers ( where I was playing the night before 
with this comp ) and now the same thing happens even on the live servers.


I contacted tech and after installing new vid drivers, directX 8.1 
again, and then re-installing EQ again ( they saud this would solve it 
all ) it still happens BUT it did let me log on all the way once just 
after I installed DX again...then logged off and it happened all over 
again and still does.....any thoughts??


Thanks,
Matt
