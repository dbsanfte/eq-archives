Nedaria's Landing won't open till LDoN, and without Jaggedpine, couldn't 
be reached on foot anyway.

PoK won't be opened till PoP is, I'm sure I've seen that stated.

Clarity potions - if they keep the recipes that are current, and the 
items on vendors in old world zones, shamans will be able to make levels 
1,2,3,4,6 and 9 immediately (well once the mobs ae killable), as the 
drops are old world. Might take some effort as some items sell only in 
Freeport, others only in Halas, etc. Levels 5 and 10 need Kunark era 
drops - the others need PoP or DoN I think.

A good source of income mayhap?
