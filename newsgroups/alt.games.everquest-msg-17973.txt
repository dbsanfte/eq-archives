The question I'd ask myself is am I really offended by people putting down
products or services I use?
I wouldn't trust any ISP that forces my to install their software onto my
system to use their service (there is no way around this with AOL you either
use it or you use another ISP) Besides from my experience, AOL's service is
adequate at best for gaming, it's ok for browsing I 'spose.

As for microsoft, I use plenty of thier products, even paid for some of them

Apparently Microsoft are not happy with the performance of OE. After the
recent Foot and Mouth outbreak in the UK it became apparent that there did
exist a virus that OE was not responsible for propagating.
