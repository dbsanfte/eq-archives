Maybe it is because I'm not yet in a guild, but my cleric very rarely ever
gets more than his fair share to make up the cost of the Symbols he casts
and rarely even his fair share.  Also, as I've explained elsewhere, the
druid's mana level is basically meaningless to the group.  The cleric's mana
level determines when pulls are done.  Because of this, ANY use of mana by
the cleric affects the group.  A druid could leave, do a port, and come back
and the group will still roll during the druid's absence ... and has on many
of an occasion (these port runs supposedly done for guild members, but
there's no way to know).  A cleric leaves and the group has to fight its way
out of the dungeon and wait for him to return or find another cleric.  And
no group does pulling constantly.  We routinely take breaks for water, food,
bio, sale runs, etc.  Why not allow the cleric to at LEAST do a rez during
one of these breaks?  Better yet, why can't one of those breaks be called
because the cleric is doing such a rez?  That a group then expects to
receive the vast majority of this rez money is just ridiculous in my eyes.
Even sleazy talent agents only take 20% of their talent's income and not
over 80% as you're saying clerics should give away.  Also, I think
non-clerics use the "you're slowing the group" excuse to get a cut of rez
money.  They see the big plat amounts being offered and drool at getting
them.  I feel that if they want to earn rez money, start up a cleric.

Now maybe all this will solve itself when I finally join a guild.  I've had
many high-level clerics say that I need to now join a guild since many of
the place I'll soon want to go are "bring your own group" locations and I'll
need at least a small guild raid to get upgrades to some of my present gear.
Been considering a lot of guild invitations.  Did an induction "quest" for
one guild, but it was poorly organized and executed; the officer had to
leave thus me and the other inductee didn't get inducted; haven't been
inducted since and that was last week the "quest" happened; and they're at
best a low-50's guild and I plan to go all the way to 60 with my cleric.
However, everytime I ask people that invite me to their guild why their
"great" guild is great, their usual and almost only answer has been "we care
for each other" and a distant second place reason is "the officers are good
leaders".  That reminds me of the Chris Rock's come-back to Black males that
boast they provide for their families.  "You want a cookie?!  You're suppose
to provide for your family, you fool!"  Guilds are supposed to care for each
other and officers are supposed to be good leaders.  That's the basic
minimum for any guild.  Oh well, I guess I need to hunt for a good guild as
much as I need to hunt of better WIS gear.  ;)
