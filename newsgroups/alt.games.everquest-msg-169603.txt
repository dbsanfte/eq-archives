Actually, I just noticed.  In the cited example, 'zackly' was actually at 
one time a perfectly acceptable alternate spelling of 'exactly'.  I found 
it in some crusty old dictionary of my aunt's, and was pleased, because I 
always felt that it was a much more sensible spelling. :)

}"talking", how would you SEE the misspelling? The ogre might say:

See previous comment about ogre mouths and the funny shape that they are.

}"Me am trying to kill critters."
}but not,
}"Mi ame tryoing too kil criters"

No, but perhaps, "Me be trine to keel cridders."

}They sound the same, so why misspell?

Well, they don't actually.  "Criters" would have a hard i, pron. 
"kryters".  Which would just be stupid.

}Rhett Butler's "Suh" is another good example. It tells us he is saying
}"Sir," but with an accent. If you spelled it "siir", then we just
}think its a mistake.

Unless you're roleplaying an alien race with an interesting assortment of 
dipthongs in its native tongue.  I could see a Shissar saying it that way.
