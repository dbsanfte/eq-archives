That's what's so odd with you people. SoW does not take 5 Seconds, if you're
in stress in a group in battle, having SoW not loaded. I don't have
SoW up, as every shammy gets SoW boots, clickable, during his epic. I have
to use my damaged keyboard to type some tell to the guy that I'm now busy
if he can wait, then sit down, mem the SoW and cast it. That's just plain
annoying if people do it 50 times within 4 hours.

I nearly always do this though. And if you catch me sitting somewhere in
a city or so, you'll get your sow. But quit this 'I have a right to it
and WTF it just takes 5 seconds' attitude. It's annoying :)

: direct risk to your life, I put my own chars life at risk more often then
: not when doing a C.R, sometimes I've died as a result (if lucks against you
: heh.. 3 failed fd's and 5 chain casting mobs on you = dead monk)

Yay, but normally people do CR's just for their guild or group. You'll
have yet to show me the guy that get's a tell often and does a CR for
the next best stranger this way. Maybe you are that way, but I haven't yet
met one. And if it's a group situation: Shamen (and chanetrs etc) risk
dieing a lot more with their slows and tashes at later levels than any melee :)

: And lets be honest, once you gain a few levels SoW isn't even mana heavy in
: the slightest

True. Never complained about that, though.
