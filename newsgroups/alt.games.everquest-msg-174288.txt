I cancelled the account on my credit card (why pay for something you
won't be playing, heh) and at the time, all account info are saved for
6 months and after will be erased if there is that 6 months of
inactivity.

I'm more and more convinced I'll still have the same enjoyment I had
back when I played. I'll probably start up sometime in the next month
or two depending how much time I have available. :)
