Kelethin was burned down, the orcs poured out from Crushbone, at the same 
time a large army of undead appeared from the seas. The fight lasted for 
days and days and in the end everything was destroyed.

I believe the elf npc that tells the longer version of the story is in the 
nettleville bank, but I might be wrong, not playing since beta so can't 
doublecheck. (If I'm wrong it might be worth to check the bar in 
castleview).

Have fun in there =)
