I give this an 8.0 in execution, but it's a low starting difficulty so
no bonus points.

Please note that the question asked is not "why do you play EQ" or even "why
do you play any MMORPG".  Just "Why do you play".  I can only assume the
poster is asking the existential question of why humans play games.  This
conversation works (with minor changes) for eq, pinochle, chess,
skateboarding, scrabble, watching movies, or almost any other
non-financially-motivated activity.

Indeed.  Is that not enough?
