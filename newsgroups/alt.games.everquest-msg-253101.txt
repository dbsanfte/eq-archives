Its not a question of where I'm bound, its of where the cleric is bound. 
   And its not my business to tell the cleric where to bind... except in 
this screed I'm making the observation that the cleric's judgement 
should tell him to bind near the action if there's any chance he's going 
to die and want to be able to pop everyone back up on their feet in 
short order.

Its certainly a judgement call... but in my experience, that almost 
always means the cleric should bind near the fight; other self binding 
classes have a lot more flexibility on this, they only get held to the 
standard "if there's a good chance I'll die and we'll want me back in 
there quick with the time so tight that we can't afford to rez me".  In 
my mage's case, this means losing only 40% of a mana bar, as naked I 
don't have anything close to my full mana pool once I get dressed.  And 
since I won't have any malachite, it doesn't even mean I'll have a pet 
to fight in with; it actually makes more sense much of the time to be 
bound at a bank, so I can get a pet up for CR if needed.

This is true of every class, in the end.  However, in this thread I'm 
examining the descision making process.

Specifically:
"Not doing some kind of damage if mana isn't a problem for heals"

Thats pretty general, could mean nuking, could mean using pet, could 
mean melee (once we hit the summoned hammer series, this is actually 
moderately effective, and with Yaulping costs very little mana regen), 
could mean stunning (I know, thats not technically damage... but its 
something better than sitting on your butt FM waiting to heal someone), 
could mean lots of things.

Sadly, I never got that one, the lower level Mark of Karn heals for 
about 6 points, which can't be defined as working "well" unless you're 
PLing.  The line that damages the mob when it hits someone actually 
seems better in many cases, as that DS adds to the various other forms 
of DS; course both are only worth using when the mob is going to be 
alive for a while.  Many situations these days are built around killing 
lots of mobs quickly, instead of a few mobs slowly.

My favorite part of Mark of Karn is where it removes any DS the mob is 
running (hmm, almost any, I think there's a ranger type one it doesn't 
touch, but that one is very tiny)
