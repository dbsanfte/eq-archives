I noticed the level range of mobs that you can xp from is tiny; the effect
is that groups can be awkward. For example, had a group with a 15 , 2 17's
and a 19 playing. The mobs the 19 wanted to tackle were usually white and in
groups, whereas i felt white singles would work better, especially as we
kept getting adds and had our backs to water and other large groups of nasty
mobs, so running was problematic. After we wiped a few times and disbanded,
i went back to soloing white mobs with no difficulty, because HO work so
well solo. Unfortunately, the mobs i wanted for my quest were grey but in
groups, so i couldn't solo them. :P

The level ranges in eq1 were a lot greater i feel. Does anyone
agree/disagree?
