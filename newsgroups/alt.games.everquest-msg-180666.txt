HP/AC/stat buffs work.  The effect of stat buffs is...  questionable.  Some
spells don't work purely because of the way they are designed (the spells,
not the pets).  The ranger +atk line of group buffs (CoP) can't be cast on
pets, cause a ranger can either cast it on their group, or on another group
via /tgb, but it can't be cast on "an individual" (it's always aimed at a
group, even if it's a group of one).  Depending on the pet-handler's class,
there's buffs that would normally stick to a pet but conflict with the
pet-handler's pet buffs.  And of course bard songs never affect pets.
