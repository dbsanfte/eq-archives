How was it short sighted of Sony to release an expansion to their largest
paying customer base?  Most, and I would guess over 95% of players, have a
50+ character.  Many hard core gamers have several accounts with 50+ chars
on each account.  I have 2 accounts myself with 50+ chars.  I know one guy
that has 8 accounts.  I'm sure he got 8 copies of PoP.

Sony can easily see what percentage of used chars are over a certain level.
The last expansion was primarily for all levels.  Why shouldn't they cater
to their largest customer base for this expansion?
