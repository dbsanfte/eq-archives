Careful turning in the sashes. They lower Bloodsaber faction (I believe 
it's SK) and you may become KOS to them as well down there. Turn them in 
in small groups and check your faction down there. I turned as many in 
as I could (bout 30 or so) and became indifferent down there from 
amiable. Of course, in that time I became amiable to the pally guild.
