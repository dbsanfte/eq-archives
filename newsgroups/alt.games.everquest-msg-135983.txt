Believe me, shouting for the owners will NOT help. Did that once time in 
NFP after i found a bag.
Result:
12 claims to the bag. 9 of them did not even manage to identify the 
right type of bag (10 slot backpack). 3 others had no idea on items.

Results in tells:
2 people calling me names for not giving them the bag.
1 person threaten to report me.

Results in public:
2 persons (one being one from the tells part) call me names in ooc and 
claim i stole their stuff.
1 person trying to start false rumors about me.

Numbers of people being able to identify a single items of the 7 items 
in tbe bag - 0

This were in NFP with 80 people. Now try imagining this in bazaar with 
400 people.


And no offence, but persons who drop fro 12K worth of stuff on the 
ground instead of getting friends/guildies to transfer ARE taking a huge 
unnessesary change. And persons who do this in the bazaar, at the moment 
the most untilzed zone in the game are just plain stupid. I would MAYBE 
feel sad for them if they lost the items after dropping them in the 
hidden room, since not many people know that room.
