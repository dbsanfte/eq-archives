I logged on last night and got new patch stuff.  I haven't logged on for
about a week.  Before logging on and getting patches I upgraded to the new
Nvidia Detonator drivers.

Oh....my....GAWD!!!

The graphics are amazing now.  I didn't see anything in the patch message
about any graphics upgrade.  Was this just from the drivers or were there
some alterations to the graphics engine as well?  If it's the drivers I am
supremely impressed!

Also I think the load time has been cut by like 75% for me.  Good stuff!

Sean...
