Cause you say things like "If i tank or a warrior tanks, the difference
isn't noticeable."

I'm *well* equipped.  I'm sub-VT, sub-elemental, and not sub-much of
anything else.  I've got a ton of AAs.  And no doubt about it, the clerics
*know* when I'm tanking instead of a warrior.

So, either you've got 8k hp and 1400+ AC, or you're playing a different
game.  If you've got 8k hp and 1400+ AC, you're not helping the guy that
posted this thread.  :p
