Yeah, I hear that the new nForce chipsets have quite a
nice sound system integrated into the board.

My first (and only) integrated sound board is this new
Epox 8KHA+ board with integrated "AC97" sound, and I can't
believe how much better the new Audigy sounds than the
AC97!  I guess that the year 1997 part of "AC97" should
be an indicator to how good the sound will be :^)
