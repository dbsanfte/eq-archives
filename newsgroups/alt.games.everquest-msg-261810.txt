Thats not entirely fair to the Dual Wielder. 9/22 falls in the "budget"
category of weapons. For non-twinks a warior could do a lot worse then dual
wielding Lammentations.  A warriors primary concern is getting aggro,
dealing damage is a far FAR distant second.

Now a ranger dual wielding thise same Lammy's ? Different story all
together....
