I also want to add my thanks for that GREAT post
I printed it out as well... 

I have a brand new Kitty bard that just made 21
Even tho I have just ALMOST made it to twisting 5 songs.. 
can only really make 4 twist, its pain tho
I use the alt + number combo to twist
havng stretch fingers across the keys and also do doing that double
tap to stop song and start next one is hard on the hand.

I tried to make a hotkey to cast multiple songs and it kind of worked,
but if one 'fizzled' it screwed up the sequence

Really wish VI would put in 'goto' command in macros, and some key
command to break the endless loop you would make with that command.
I wish.. I could remember the seperater symbol you use to put multiple
commands on one macro line.  That would help a lot
