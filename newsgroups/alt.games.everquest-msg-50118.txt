Seems to me you are arguing the difference between 'single group
encounters', of which there are plenty, and 'safe pickup group zones' of
which there are fewer. This isn't a design problem, it's a problem with the
lack of imagination/curiosity/ability of pickup groups.
I _never, ever_ had trouble finding somewherte to exp from 54-60 but I have
a regular group who are keen to visit and explore out-of-the-way places and
over that time we probably exped in all of the places listed at the top of
this thread.
