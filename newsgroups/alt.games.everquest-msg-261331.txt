Unless you are on the Firiona Vie server, you cannot buy LDoN points 
with plat, unless perhaps by paying people to go do LDoN runs for you 
while you aren't with them.

Hmm, that -would- work, you could hire a group of up to 5 people, they 
would join you, get a mission, then you would disband, and off they'd go 
for the mission.  If they succede, you get points just as if you'd been 
there, if they fail, you get a fail mark on the leaderboard that nobody 
looks at anyway.

I've yet to see anyone offering this service, perhaps because its pretty 
lame, or maybe just nobody thought of it yet.

------------------------------
Anyway, back to what I was saying.  You can't buy points directly on 
other servers, they come only from completing LDoN missions.

On the Firiona Vie server, most if not all of the items you can buy with 
LDoN points are tradable (very little on FV is tagged No Drop).  This 
means you can buy those items with plat, then turn them in to get credit 
back, although I think that this now may involve losing some points.

But better than that, you can simply have the person selling points get 
the item you want directly, so you don't have to worry about any loss 
built in.

But there's a problem.  LDoN points are a little more complicated than 
they look.  See, there's points, which spend like pp sort of, but then 
there's a "points you earned at this type of mission"; you could have 
50000 points but if you've only ever done 50 points of Tak missions, 
then the most expensive item you can buy at the Tak merchant will cost 
50 points.  You can buy a thousand of them... but not one can cost more 
than 50 points.

So you may find the person selling his points can't buy what you want, 
if he hasn't unlocked a high enough level at that LDoN mission.  In this 
case, you'll have to buy his points directly instead of having him buy 
what you need.

But you may also find that you don't have a high enough limit; then 
you'll need to find someone with both the points and the limit to allow 
him to buy for you.

Worst case, neither your seller nor you have a high enough limit; now 
you need to find a third party who does have the limit required, and get 
the points to him!

Annoying isn't it?  Well, if you aren't on the FV server you can't do it 
at all, so feel relieved; if you are, feel blessed.
