My characters name is Felinea Firestorm a level 48 Magician on Xegony.  I
have done a good portion of the epic quest including completeing quest for
Power of the Orb.  I am now left with the daunting task of completeing the
rest of the quest which includes several high level mobs.  I am an officer
with "Wolfpack of Norrath" but alas my guild is fairly low in level with me
being one of the highest level characters.  If anyone on Xegony in a larger
(high level guild) can possibly find it in there heart to help me out with
this quest it would be greatly appreciated.  I beleive I have done
everything that I can possibly quest for on my own without big guild help so
here I am asking for assistance.   Thank you in Advance =)
