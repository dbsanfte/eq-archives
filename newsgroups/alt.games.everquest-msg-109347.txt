Stalin won WWII, and yet neither the West nor the Soviet regime were 
under any illusion that he was anything but an evil, paranoid psychopath 
(as Lenin himself knew. He was against Stalin being given too much 
power), and he was promptly disowned by the Politburo after his death.

The US's "evils" in WWII are so subdued in the history books not 
necessarily because they won the war, but because they don't come 
anywhere close to comparing, even remotely, to the evil of the Third 
Reich.
