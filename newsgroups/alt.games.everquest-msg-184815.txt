    The stuff in the castle in PoD is charmable, at the very least with the
level 65 necromancer charm (I don't know what the level cap is on lower
necromancer charms). Three necromancers and a cleric from my guild killed
Gryme and the spider boss inside using charmed stuff. PoS, you won't find
anything worthwhile, and PoNb is a waste of time for XP. There's undead in
the woods in PoV - you could check them and see. The big undead charm zone,
though, is CoD.
