Very true. Honestly, I gave up after tracking the 40 instances, but it 
has become a quite noticeable trend for me following the last 2 patches.

Another thing that has become noticeable is that when pulling to the 
Shaman with a Chanter, the first mob hit results in a stun almost 90% of 
the time, and the Chanter's first cast after the "unstun" message is 
always a fizzle. If no stun, no fizzle.  It's been quite a while since 
I've played a low level INT caster, but I don't remember this catching 
my attention on my Necro at this level (29), but that was almost 3 years 
ago now )

AND, it just could be me ). I work while I play, great company allows 
almost anything as long as your work is done on time and at a certain 
quality level, and lately I'm weeks ahead of schedule on the modules I'm 
writing, so I can concentrate on the EQ screen more closely than usual.

You're more than likely correct, as I have noticed a definite 
streakiness in the PRNG as you mention, while tradeskilling or getting 
wep skill ups.
