I'm not talking about cheating.  People cheat in online conflict
games. It happens. I doubt highly that it won't happen equally for all
three sides though so in the end its a wash.   And as for breaking
fiction, well so what? If they are after functionality and making a
team based combat rpg then breaking fiction is a price I will pay in
order to know my enemies. It's not like there isn't fiction breaking
in other online games as well.  It is  a PVP based game after all.
Anyone who buys it thinking otherwise has been seriously misled.
I haven't seen any attempt by mythic yet to pull an Origin and sell a
PK paradise like UO as anything but.

So they can equip their people with walking dead men transports. So
what? How does that screw me any worse then twinking in EQ does? 
I'm not sure but I think there will be bonuses to using equipment from
your own realm over the others.

See there's the difference. I wouldn't mind at all if I got ganked by
an enemy I knew was an enemy from the get go. To me that's the
difference between pvp and pk. The fight where both know ahead of time
versus the fireball in the back. I don't mind fighting for my team and
dying for my team as long as I know who my team is.

Again, how? If the static list is based strictly on class/level then
the only way to do the above is for someone to be willing to suicide
for your group to get exp? And it would have to be an equivalent level
enemy or the mob wouldn't target it. If you lose more by dying then by
killing the mob (which is true in every rpg pretty much) then someone
would be losing a lot more then they gain by being the sacrificial
lamb.  And AI doesn't need to be able to adapt. Not if the devs watch
what's going on adapt for it. If a common strategy develops that
exploits the static list then change the list.
