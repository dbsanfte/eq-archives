Oh, right. Julie never *told* anyone to do anything, she *asked*. That's 
like saying extortion isn't really a crime, it's just giving good advice. 
As a parent, I may tell a child, "Please don't use your crayons on the 
wall." Do you think I'm merely asking them not to do so? Nope. Let's not 
argue the semantics of that. The word, "please" does not always 
automatically change an instruction to a request. Often it just puts a 
polite spin on it. However, I'm done arguing the semantics, because it's 
silly.

And you were wrong. I'm no member of the 42 fan club or anything, but up 
until now, any negative points made by either side were done in a civil 
manner. *You're* the one who lost your cool and resorted to insults. 
Perhaps *you* should pay more attention.

How are you sure of that? I'm just curious.

That's quite a generalization there - kinda like saying that the only 
people you can ever remember committing any transgressions against you 
had tattoos, so beware all people with tattoos. By the same token, I 
don't feel it offers *you* any more credibility than the next person. 
Like I said, who the hell is Ross Ridge? As far as I'm concerned, you may 
as well be going by Who Flung Poo, in which case, by your thinking, you 
would suddenly have less credibility.
