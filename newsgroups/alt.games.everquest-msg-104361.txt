LOL, Dumb ranger has a major flashback from that one.  I got a map to
befallen and decided I'd go in and explore some.  YUCK is all I can say.
Took me a while to figure out where the first key was.  Finally got it and
headed off to get the second.  Noted on map: hole to 3rd floor, don't fall
in.  HAHAHAHA, dumb ranger not looking at her feet falls right in.  Look
around at mobs on 3rd floor.  Look at map, hmm, says if I kill mob for 3rd
key he has 2nd key too, so I can get out ok.  Start toward mob for 3rd key.
See lots of blue, white and yellow mobs.  RUN back to room I started in to
think, seems pretty safe there.  Check guild, no one on at the moment.
Check friends list, no one on at the moment.  All alone in befallen, STUCK.
Ok, I can handle this.  Log, go to guild email list and send out a plea for
help.  Got 2 responses by the next day.  When I log back in, STUPID ranger
decides to go up the little mound of dirt in the room I'm in.  Got jumped by
3 skels from 2nd floor and died.  So on CR back to Befallen, guildies
finally log in.  They say how'd you get out in commons?  I fire back still
stuck in befallen, I died.  Can you help still?  So, pally and wiz come in
with me, pally happy to smack down some undead.  We get down to where body
is, I loot and we gotta call back the pally cuz he's having fun smacking on
the undead.  Thanks to wiz we all port out.  Lesson learned, when the map
says there is a hole, look before you enter the room.

Thanks to best guild on Bristlebane, Council of Truth, I love you guys!
