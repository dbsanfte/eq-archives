That's a good idea!  Problem is, though, that it takes many, many
pp to learn most skills, and you just can't get that much $$$ from
the low-level mobs - and, that's assuming that you can buy the
ruined wolf pelts or whatever from the local merchants/players.

I do enjoy the social aspect of the game and certainly do my share
share of chatting with party members (as my taking the time to write
these lengthy postings should indicate :^)  I think that most would
agree that EQ is more than a chat-room, though, and everything in the
game wants you to get higher levels for more spells/abilities so you
can visit that next zone where you'd get your butt cremed if you were
too low.
