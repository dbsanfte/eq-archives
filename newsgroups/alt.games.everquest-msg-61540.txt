  Yep, some people are way oversensitive about killstealing.  I personally
don't see what the big deal about killstealing is unless it is obviously
done with malice, or if it's done on a rare mob or a mob who is known to
have a nice drop.  As if it's really difficult to run off and find another
young kodiak or what have you.  Not that I condolne killstealing, but there
are a lot of people out there who just need to chill.

  It doesn't really matter, though.  A person's only wasting their own time
by reporting you for supposed killstealing attempts.  You won't get in
trouble for it unless a GM actually catches you in the act, which you won't
if you don't intentionally killsteal.  It is, however, an unfortunate waste
of limited GM/Guide resources to /petition somebody about them killstealing
you without making any attempt to resolve the situation on your own.
