I was asleep one night, and (before you ask, YES I DREAM ABOUT
EVERQUEST...I'm currently in counselling) had an in-character dream.  A
bardic play...a guild who does them... <Norrathian Thespian Troupe>!  We
could do Shakespearian plays In-Character in FP!  At the Theatre of the
Tranquil!  It could be genius!  We could do Romeo and Juliet, there's a good
enough balcony.  We could do Macbeth!  'Course Macbeth would be better done
in the arena, for the big battle sequence...Nothing like REAL deaths!  If
anyone else thinks this is a good idea, let me know about it...we could
really make this work!
