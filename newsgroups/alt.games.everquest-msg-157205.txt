I don't know where you normally xp, but I don't wait on a cleric for a
group, never have.  Not for xping.  I don't have my semiCH spell yet, and
long before the changes, and still now, I have been the only healer in an xp
group.  I expect that will continue.  I also, often have grouped with a
cleric, it's a nice change to switch to a more offensive role.  I have never
worried about group composition for xping, and I don't plan on starting
anytime soon.  I play with whatever friends of mine are available,
regardless of class, and we just manage to get xp somehow anyway.  Oh, and
we have fun.  You know, that thing that you should be wanting to have while
playing a game.
