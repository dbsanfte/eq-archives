50 american dollars to move characters, and all your gear is stripped. So
picking right is a good thing.

As far as I know (after having picked luclin, great server, few aussies)
there are three servers with australian guilds. One guild is called
"jesters of fate" and is on the Rathe server. www.jestersfate.com.
Aurora Noctem are on the tribunal server, can't seem to find their
web page though. The third is Southern Armada on the prexus server.

As an Australian over-crowding is generally not a concern. Good luck,
and welcome to EQ.
