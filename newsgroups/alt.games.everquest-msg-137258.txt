grats :)   hes the one velious mob for us too that were yet to kill

so many ifs.. 1 more melee, like 2 more nukes.. if he hadnt warped on the
pull (I guess because of bard songs)

cuz of the warp, the MA was in the wrong place, and several caster type
people died at the very start.

enrage was the real killer though, he turned at the very second of enrage
and killed something like 15 melees.. we estimate he had about 5k hitpoints
left (no real red visible, enrage already passed etc)

hopefully we can go 1 better next time /cry
