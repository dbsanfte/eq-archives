I can relate, sucks to be a shammy trying to do trials. I took the
lazy way out and got some friends in our server's resident uber guild
to help me get flagged. Didn't help me much since even though I was
flagged, most of the people I regularly group with weren't and
wouldn't be since they were still in their 50s. Still, it was one less
thing for me to worry about. Having heard the horror stories of other
people getting flagged, getting it out of the way in an hour was
definitely nice.

I switched over to 100% AA at 61, waiting for most of my friends to
catch up (which wasn't till last weekend when most of them got flagged
in one sitting, thanks again to uber friends). Even with a POV flag, I
didn't really hunt there since someone always seemed to be along that
wasn't flagged and I wasn't about to leave friends that I'd known for
years out of a group because of flag issues.  Switching to AA wasn't a
big deal since I wanted to get cann5 anyway. 

As for hunting spots, from the perspective of a 61 shaman, here's a
couple. 

PoD - Only place with good exp are the spiders and rat tunnels. Might
be worth working on your Crypt of Decay key and hunting the pussling
area. 

PoN - Any of the spider camps, not just consorts. Hobgoblin tunnels.
Slarithug (sp?) are always ignored and even make a nice solo spot once
you figure out the pathing and pull order of the first 3 by consorts. 

PoJ- Hidden tunnels and the basement leading up to Mauvin's room. 

Sebilis still has a surprising number of blue cons, even on the first
floor. Bugs or necros make nice solo or duo spots, Chef/bar is still
mostly blue. Anything in the basement. 

Kael Arena or Tomax bridge, 

If you have a good group of around 60th lvl, ...
Dragon Necropolis down in the rat tunnels, Ssra, 2nd floor. Cazic
Thule, take a group in deep to the top of throne room and the
pyramids. Siren's Grotto, jump to the bottom of the well or crawl
through the castle. Chardok down in the tunnels. Krokusk (sp?),
graveyard, bridgekeeper. 

Head to WW and solo some dragons or to SF to solo some Guardian Wurms
(still far from a trivial solo). 

Hope this helps
