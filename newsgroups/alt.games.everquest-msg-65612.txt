Yikes! Not just a level. A 50 level no less.
*sigh*

So in order to get a top class specific skill you need to level to 59 and
then level 18 times more! Plus what ever the the skill costs which
looks like 3 to 9 more times!

Well that certainly sours the taste of all those new cool skills.
Oh well. =)
