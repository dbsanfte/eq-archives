On my 65 DE Necro, with a Talisman of Vah Kerrath (8), Sanguine Robe (5) and
a Z heart (5), I only got 17 total regen.  Havent tested this in while, as a
Z heart isnt in my normal load out, and I guess its possible that I
calculated wrongly when I did test.  I think that is unlikely though as I
was specifically trying to see if the Z heart and the Sanguine Robe stacked
(since they both have the same listed effect), and what, if any, the cap on
HP regen from items was.

In any case, I will try and test again soon.
