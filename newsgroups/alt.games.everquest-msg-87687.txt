Hi there,

Ok I've stood on the sidelines long enough. I played Ultima Online for a
while, but Everquest and all its potential attractions has grabbed my
interest guys. I need some help though.

Here's my story:
P3 550
Voodoo 3 card.
Windows XP
256 Ram.

56k Modem running from a quality ISP in Australia.

1. First of all, will my system cope? I know the latest expansion has a
monster hunger for power..but can I play with just the original game, plus
1-2 of the other expansions? Or would I be missing out on too much flavour?

2. Does the game have a sense of adventure and relief? Can I spend time in a
town chatting/socialising-soaking up atmosphere...then head out into vast
and varied wilderness seaking fame and fortune? Is this the basic theme of
Everquest? or is it more about baking and woodcutting like Ultima.

3. Is everywhere extremely crowded, particular hoardes of people camped out
at monster spawns?  This doesnt appeal to me.

Basic questions I know, but its hard for a newbie to get basic info on the
game.

Any info much appreciated.

Thanks

Pete
