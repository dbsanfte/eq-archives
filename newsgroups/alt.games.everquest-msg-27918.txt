Way back when Ro armor was some of the best pre-planar paladin armor, I
needed the services of a porter to finish smithing my last two pieces.
IIRC, I paid somewhere around 300pp (all my platinum in the world) for a
port from Butcherblock to Lavastorm, back to Butcherblock and finally back
to Lavastorm plus a few minutes of waiting in between each port while I
finished the quests.  He tried to give my money back, once he realized I
had given him 300+pp as opposed to the 30pp he asked for - but in my state
of joyous delirium at having a full set of the armor finally, I insisted.
Real nice guy, shame I haven't seen him much since then.
