I have never seen it on a fizzle myself, but if someone else does so be
it. 

I'd already covered sense heading and taunt in the earlier bit and yes
those Ive seen on fails, though less frequently than on successes so yes
partial credit in those skills as well as others....

Spells are still easier to advance since you can pick a low level crap
spell with no fizzle (or near no fizzle and cast like crazy) Rangers do
this routinely with Dance of the FIreflies to get the conjure skill up
high enough that cswarm will go off....I assume every other caster has
similar issues....that was the big point I was trying to make...
