Other people may not do it that way, but _I_ do.  EQ2 quests aren't as
vague as EQ quests.  The fact that some, maybe most, don't want to
play that way doesn't mean it's an invalid design, just one that
doesn't work for everyone.

And pretty much the same holds true in EQ2 for me, of the 240ish
quests I've completed maybe five or ten I have done any out of game
research on, often because they've been broken in some way (which I
can certainly believe WoW does better, SOE really need to fix up their
QA process).

In the case of EQ2, that's either because they're used to it from
other games, or they just aren't interested in solving them on their
own.  I like doing it on my own, with sometimes a bit of help from
someone in game, and I like there being a bit of legwork involved.

I've never had to do that in EQ2, it just isn't as necessary as you
seem to think it is.

I quite agree, some people will prefer WoW, some EQ2, some EQ, etc.
That's not a bad thing.

Not that I know anything about WoW quests, really, as I've only done
something like the first four quests I found in night elf land.  They
may have much the same appeal as EQ2 quests to me, for all I know.
