Actually, no extensive tradeskill testing was done that I can find.  On 
the EQtraders board, they've mostly said that they don't stack on the 
basis that someone on Safehouse said backstab mods don't stack.  Tenuous 
evidence at best.

Verant has said that mods should stack, but won't take you over the cap.
They've also supposedly confirmed the not stacking part, but I can't find 
that now.

Still, point is, it'd take a buttload of combines to actually effectively 
test it, and as far as I know, no one has.

But to make the rumor complete:  it also supposedly doesn't use the 
highest skill mod item you have, but the one that's in the highest 
priority slot.  It's unclear what the priority order of the slots is.
