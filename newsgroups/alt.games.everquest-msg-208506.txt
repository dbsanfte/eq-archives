You are, of course correct.  I forgot about Serpent Sight, because my
Troll Shaman has used it only once or twice on other players, likewise
I've not needed Spirit Sight.  And I never liked FoL except as an aid
to running away (and the last time I tried to use it for that with a
character it appeared to be broken, the mob stuck to me no matter how
I tried to get away from it, despite three unresisted FoLs).  Of course,
given the value of Serpent Sight to the night-blind, I really have to
wonder about the L48 Barb Shaman who couldn't cast Invis to save her
life the other night.
