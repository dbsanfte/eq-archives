People have been running egg timers on their 'crack' for a very long 
time. There are even equi mods that implement rudimentary timers, used 
for buff timing, (spawn timing, and what not else). This just saves them 
the hassle.

Mobs can't zone because the models don't exist in the adjacent zones 
files, and its not part of the 'global models data' that players, player 
armour, and pets are in). I'm curious to see how the mage summon monster 
is going to work now. (random model? naked human male?)
