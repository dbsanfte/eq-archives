No skirts for dorfs. Gatorscale Leggings which drop in Upper
Guk have some +Wis and give a "leather" look if that's what
you're after. I can't recall now if Fine Steel greaves
(created by blacksmith players) look the same as iron
greaves under Luclin models or not, but that could be
another option.

Well Luclin armor has been discussed a lot.  My main is a
mage, so I
havent really focused on it too much.  But just started a
baby dwarf
cleric.

A kind soul passing by gave cleric a scarab bp.  Nice
looking green
armor in Luclin graphics.  So I went ahead and did the
newbie scarab
helm quest.  Now have nice matching green helm.

Then my main just couldnt resist and gave baby cleric some
money.  So
cleric runs to vender and buys iron leggings.

Oh argh we have here a serious fashion conundrum.  Leggings
are grey
mottled peddlepushers.

Baby cleric looks totally stupid.

I mean really stupid.

So question is, given that I'm willing to twink a bit, what
legs
should a new cleric have?  That look good, dont cost too
much and are
not totally unbalancing?  AND... are not peddlepushers.

Is there anyway a female dwarf cleric can have a skirt?
Like the nice
high elf or halfling clerics?
