I also like the idea of squishing all the true newbies onto one server 
to grow together, instead of having them drifting alone through barren 
zones scattered accross 30 servers...the highlight of a session bumping 
into hyper-twinked powerlevellers who wouldn't give him the time of day...

Its a good idea that has merit. I only wonder if new alts from 
non-newbie players should be allowed there...

Positives and Negatives to that.
