Dude give it up. If i am grouping instead of raiding I frequently LOOK for a
RANGER .Hard ldons , god groups, pop dosent matter. I LOOK for a RANGER . I
also LOOK for a cleric , a slower(any of 3 will do), a tank (any of 3 will
do), a crowd control for some places (bard or chanter), a puller for some
places (not always needed), AND a RANGER.

I want from rangers TRACKING, SNARING, GREAT BUFFS ,maybe weaponshield once
in a blue moon , but the bread and butter day in and day out is DPS. And a
ranger does that just fine.

You just dont deserve any more loving. Sorry.

CLERIC
BARD
BEASTLORD

are all over powered. Rangers are somewhere in the next three :p you are
more powerfull and loved than nine other classes at a bare minimum.

So quit whining :)
