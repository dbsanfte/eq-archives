As far as eating pork vs. sexual behavior goes:
Jesus declared all foods clean.
(Mark 7: 1-23 for the full context, Mark 7:18-23 specifically.)
Eating pork does not destroy your relationship with God.
Sins of the heart do.

Other places in the New Testament echo this.
In Acts 10: 9-16  God gives a revelation to Peter.  (though the 'unclean
food' is used as a metaphor in the vision to mean that it is OK for the
apostle Peter to have dealings with non-Jewish people, even though the
religious authorities of the day had declared as them as 'unclean.')

Also, in 1 Timothy 4:1-5, the Apostle Paul echo's Jesus' declaring all foods
clean.

None of these passages lifts the prohibition against sex outside of marriage
to a partner of the opposite sex.  If anything, Jesus and the apostles
uniformly tell those who follow God to keep their sexual activity within
marriage.

There's a big difference between eating a pork chop and committing adultery.
