I must be missing something.  I never played a wizard in EQ.  Played
an enchanter up to about 30, but that was more than 4 years ago, so my
understanding of the spell system is pretty weak.

My current nooblet question concerns the spell Icestrike (and also
Shock of Flame, Fingers of Fire and Column of Frost).  I don't
understand why the latter spells are so insanely weak compared to
Icestrike.  Icestrike is 3 AOE waves of 46ish damage for 17 mana.  FoF
is 28ish PBAOE damage.  And it costs something like 47 mana.  Is there
some advantage to the higher cost spells that I'm missing?
