Here, I found this in my browsing on a message board:

Go into the EverQuest directory (the default location is "c:\\program files\\everquest"), and delete the files for the zone that you were last in, or zoning into (the file names will start with the zone name). While in the EverQuest directory you will want to also delete all files ending in the ".opt" extension along with the zone files.
