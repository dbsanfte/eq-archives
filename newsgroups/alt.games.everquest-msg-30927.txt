There's going to be flamers, clerics among them, that will say that it's the
cleric's DUTY to dump all that cash on their group without expecting
anything in return.  Their argument is that the more HP the tank has, the
less often the cleric will die.  Therefore, the cleric is paying for the
right to live, and that's okey dokey.

Bullshit.  None of my characters, especially my ugly dwarven cleric with low
CHA have enough money to throw away on other players with no regard to cost.
Sorry.  I'd rather wait for the cheapskate tank to hoof it back to the
campsite ("oh, btw, pick up some reagents while you're there, won't you?
Thanks!") than to shell out all that cash.

The good news is that MOST higher level groups (let's say 46+ just to put a
number in) realize that reagents are expensive, and clerics tend to get
enough loot to make up the cost, plus their fair share of the remainder.
