They might be quite competent. I'd rather not raid with them, though.
There are all sorts of counterintuitive details to dungeon diving that
need to be learned for a player to handle it smoothly. I think that
Verant leaves in little details like the horrible pathing in
Blackburrow and Crushbone as an object lesson.

Incidentally, I'd also be wary of taking a player who had never XPed
outside (if such a creature existed) raiding either.

Two things I often find myself telling people new to dungeon diving:

(1) Unless you know exactly what is above or below you, AE can be
very, very bad.

(2) Stay away from walls/oors you haven't passed through yet.

There's at least one spot in Chardok where a well-placed AE can pull
things from above you, below you, and through a pair of walls. If you
survive long enough, the MObs from underneath will bring a CASCADE of
sarnaks with them by the time they get to you. On a busy day, they can
take out 3 to 4 groups on their way to you as well. While discussing
the Club Fu train index, I saw a screen shot posted by a
Chardok-positive player of an *ocean* of Sarnaks, golems, and Chokidai
in the Bridgekeeper area.
