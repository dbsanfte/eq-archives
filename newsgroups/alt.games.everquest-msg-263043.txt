Just to see what you were talking about, I went back and
rewrote the post using two different top posting theories.

Personally, I find both hard to follow, much harder than the bottom 
posting one you quoted, but perhaps thats because I'm used to bottom 
posting... or more precisely, to putting responses to each point 
directly under the point itself, rather than true bottom posting.

To be thorough, I also rewrote the post in true bottom posting style, 
its pretty hard to follow too.

What I didn't do is rewrite the thing in any of the seven or eight 
possible combinations that could result from mixing top and bottom and 
mid line posting... even though its pretty likely that if everyone stuck 
to their own preference but didn't bother reformatting the posts they 
were replying to, that this is what would really result.

Windsun, want to tell me which of the four posts (including the 
original) -you- prefer, and why?

I like the one you objected to the most of the four, but it -might- just 
be because its what I'm used to.

If thats the case, well, I'd like to point out that roughly 95% of the 
posters in this newsgroup are used to the same thing.

Lance
