Games evolve, and not all of the changes are for the best.  BUT they
don't generally change on a whim.  The games change for the following
reasons:
1. To add more content in order to extend player's enjoyment.
2. To fix perceived game balance issues
3. To compete with newer games that may have better graphics or neat
new features, or a better UI. 
4. Fixes/changes based on player feedback, whiney or otherwise

I don't tihnk its possible for  any game designer to automatically
incorporate every requested change, no matter how good or reasonable
that change seems to be on paper.  The truth is that the changes still
have to go through the filter known as the designer's brain, probably
has to go through some kind of discussion.  Even then, I'm sure that
some changes look a lot better on paper, or even in Beata, than they
do when fully implememted.

As far as the article is concerned, I think it talks about things with
too many generalizations.  What is 'best' for the game?  Is whats best
for the game, that which gives it longevity, or is it that which gives
the most bang for your buck.  They are not necessarily the same thing.
Similarly, when he talks about instanced zones destroying the MMOG
aspect of the game, I have to think if the guy is playing the same
games as I do.  If he's talking about the community as being the
peopel who I see hunting in the non-instanced zones, well, that's not
much of a community unless theres some interraction.  There are all
sorts of types of interractions that don't require me to competing
against the guy for spawns, or blasting the zone with nonsensical
broadcasts.  And in fact, an instanced zone will pretty much only
interfere with those two types of interractions, and ONLY for so long
as I remain in the instanced zone.  Every other type of social
interraction is still there.

My view of MMOGs is very different -- I see every decision as being a
tradeoff.  Every intended change  (except, possibly, for moist bug
fixes) has a posititive and a negative to it.  For the most part, you
aren't going to be able to signfificantly change something to make one
person happy without pissing off someone else.  You just have to make
the changes that will piss off the fewest number of paying customers.
That's why its so immensely important to get as much of the game right
to begin with, because once you start messing with things, you can't
help but to piss people off.  Even if you aren't stepping on anyones
feet, some peole just do not like change (I've noticed that to be
especially true since I moved to the midwest).
