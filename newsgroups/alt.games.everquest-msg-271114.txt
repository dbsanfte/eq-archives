    Hmmm.  Perhaps in it's decline, EQL will offer a gameplay experience
more like what it was in the old days.  New player will have more and more
trouble finding free ubar buffs, so will learn to do without (or quit in
frustration).  Fewer older, rich characters will be about to hand out their
hand me downs.

    Heck, maybe maybe people will even start wearing bronze armor again!

/wistful thinking = OFF

   I know, that olds days are gone and they aren't terribly likely to come
back.  But it's fun to imagine they could!
