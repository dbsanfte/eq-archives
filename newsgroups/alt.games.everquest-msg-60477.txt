Unless we're talking about different things, this is wrong.

The tower is underwater, with 2 entrances to the large room for it.  One
entrance is under the aviak isle.  The tower is in the middle of a large room.
On the outside of it, there are 3 deepwater goblins at the base, and one aqua
goblin(much lower level).  Inside on the ground floor are two aqua goblins.
Inside the tower on the top floor are three deepwater goblins, and a DE NPC
named Deep, level 59 or so, indifferent faction to just about everyone, and
does not respond to hails. (The top of the tower is open, so you can just swim
into it on the 2'nd floor)

Of those goblins, the tainted / corrupted will only spawn from the two on the
top floor of inside the tower.  The left and right one will spawn the tainted
/ corrupted, and the middle one (so I've heard, haven't gotten the spawn to
pop yet) will spawn the mob needed for the cleric epic.

I'm not absolutely sure about the 3 outside deepwaters not spawning the
tainted.   I have heard that they will not though, and both times I have
camped this (around 3 hours each time) the tainteds always spawned on top of
the tower, even though we pulled all of the goblins in the area.  (Well,
actually the second time I just killed them where they stood.  Level *does*
have its privlages ; ) )

This camp is annoying, but not hard.   The last time it was just me and the
druid, 57 and 55, respectively.
