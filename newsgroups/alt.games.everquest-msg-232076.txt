I am trying to find a focus item which will speed up the casting of my
slows  (currently Forlorn Deeds takes 6 seconds to cast).

I looked on the Focus list on Allakhazam and it seemed that Affliction
Haste IV was the one I wanted. The details are:

1: Increase Spell Haste by 33%
2: Limit: Max Level(65)
3: Limit: Min Duration(30.00 sec)
4: Limit: Min Casting Time(3.00 sec)
5: Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only)
6: Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed) 

In light of this I bought a Ceramic Skull of Decay which has
Affliction Haste IV on it but it does not appear to have made any
difference to the casting time.

Did I get the wrong item? Can anyone suggest something that works?

Thanks in advance,
