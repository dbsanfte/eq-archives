I don't know where it drops.  Some of it can be crafted, but that
might still require components dropped only in the new zones.  On
EMarr someone linked a piece with lots of nice stats and effects,
req level a quite approachable 65.

What I'd like to know more about is the effect of Heroic Charisma
on faction changes.  E.g., does +3 H-CHA mean, say, +30% on faction
shifts, in which case a shift of 1 becomes 1.3 and is probably
rounded back down to 1?  Or does a 1-point shift become a 4-point
shift?  There are some factions that seem to be changed by only 1
point at a time (halfling clerics in Rivervale, for instance), and
doing those at 4x the rate might convince me to go back and do some
more faction turn-ins.

Haven't had a chance to try this yet.  Does it work only on your own
corpse or is it for mobs as well?  And does it take a while to finish
or do you loot everything immediately?

I'm assuming the problem was that tanks were already mitigating about
as much as intended (though apparently not quite well enough), but
meanwhile other classes had fallen behind so that leather/cloth classes
were getting pasted too quickly if a mob came after them.  I won't try
to argue the rangers-vs-SK issue, but in general I assume the intent is
that tanks are still better tanks than everyone else, but everyone else
isn't totally helpless.

The explanation I saw was that yes, someone had a workaround (involving
changing various registry settings), and the SOE change is an attempt to
do the same thing but without requiring you to change your settings, so
that (a) it's easier and (b) it doesn't effect other graphics apps on the
same computer.  But yes, the change does seem to have bad effects on some
boxes (including some that didn't tend to run into the West bug in the
first place), so they made it possible to disable the change.  And they
also said (in the forum thread where I found all this detail) that they
are still working on a real fix, but they wanted to make this workaround
available to everyone in the meantime in case it helped.  Sounds like a
reasonable approach to me.

There've been times I've wanted to summon within my zone, like when the
cleric falls off a ledge and dies somewhere down below.  Sure, such
cases are rare, but they still happen.  So now I'm trying to find the
now-level-57 Conjure Corpse, which in theory can be crafted using the
new spell research rules but I'm having trouble figuring out the recipe
since the effect isn't anything like any existing new-style recipes.

> er... how about SK pet haste, what are we, chopped liver?

Chipped bones?  But really, though my SK's pet does do its part, it's
such a small contribution that I've usually don't commit a spell slot
to the haste buff.  (And the refresh time on the spell is long enough
that I rarely have time to load and cast it while waiting for a pull.)

Sure, but it's basically free.  I haven't spent any AAs on mine, either.
I'm wondering what these "first ten levels" of the new AA track are; is
that in place of the old scheme where the base damage was determined by
your level?

Yeah, I wondered about them putting the NPC for the new hotzone quests in
CR, since not everyone has bought it.  Didn't even think about Combine not
having reached TSS yet.

Of course, the base items are pretty good all by themselves; you only need
the CR part if you want to go to the next higher hotzone and get a shard to
combine with the item to make it better.  But of course, you DO want that!

p.s.: Whew, I see it's been a while since I updated the levels in my sig...
