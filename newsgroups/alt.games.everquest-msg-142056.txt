Ok. A mage is rather special in that he is a master of conjuring. He can
summon all kinds of stuff with magical properties weapons, food, armour etc.
The down side is that they are NO RENT. This means that they will disappear
when you camp. Well about 30mins after you camp. You may have known this but
just letting you know. OK now to your question. To use the waterstone you
need to have it in a slot and not in a container so you cant use it if its
in a bag. When you put it in a slot you then right click it and it
disappears with a glug-glug sound. You will see an icon appear in your buff
window and you get a message 'You no longer feel the need to breathe' or
similar. This spell is great for swimming underwater. If you haven't tried
swimming yet, when you go underwater another window appears showing you how
much air you have left. With Enduring Breath you can swim underwater without
worrying about air. Hope that answers the question.

Similarly, you can't have these items in containers to cast. They have to be
in a slot or held. right click as before in the inventory window.

Sure there are lots of links with quest info. Try www.everlore.com for a
start. If you go to the links page at our guild website you'll find some
useful links for your class and of the type you are asking about. The
website is at: www.carl.skepper.btinternet.co.uk/guild/aetasexitium (Aetas
Exitium is a guild on the Antonius Bayle server). Check out Allakhazam too.
Another very useful site is eqatlas.com (all the maps and zone info you'll
need).

I wouldn't bother with books - there's more than enough info on the web.
Also might be worth joining a guild too - you'll meet others who will help
you understand and later help you with your questing. You'll  need them when
you go to Najena (to get the components for the focus items you mentioned).
BTW as a mage one of your key abilities is the use of your pet. I wouldn't
neglect research. Kind of a pain but I think its worth it. You can probably
manage up to 29 with the pet spells you buy without worrying about the
others. At 29 you get to buy 2 and at 34 the other 2 so keeping up research
is not quite as expensive if you keep on top of it. ( I maxed research at
each level - my main is a 45 mage atm). BTW as you will see, the gems for
each focus item will set you back around 500pp (in total for the 4 gems) so
get saving :). To get you started you need to go and see Joyce in the Temple
of Solusek Ro (in Lavastorm). She will tell you what she needs for each of
the focus items. Be prepared for a lot of travelling to get the stuff. I
would say they are a MUST esp if you want to do the epic, which needs two of
them anyway. In fact take a look at the Mage epic too (link on our guild
website) as some of the stuff drops in Najena in case you come across it at
the same time.


Anyway. Enough rambling from me. As you can tell I like the mage ). If you
want to know anything else then please feel free to ask all you want.
