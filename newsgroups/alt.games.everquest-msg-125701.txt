Guilty here, too...

When I've been away for a while (like the last two weeks)
I can't even log in until I've completely caught up here just
to be sure I'm not missing the things like the caster
"improvements" and other little gems.

I guess I'm chicken...but I've had times where I spent my
two-hours-before-bed-ready-to-play reading posts here.
Just to be sure folks aren't misinformed about rogues
or something, I guess...
;-)
