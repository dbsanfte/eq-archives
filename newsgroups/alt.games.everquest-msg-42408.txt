It was never put in, I think they planned to but decided not to.  I have
heard rumors of a Carpentry skill being added with SoL, maybe this will
allow you to make instruments, it would make some sense, in that the Vah

A couple of the quests have you take items to the wrong people,
generally it's the bags that are misaddressed, can't remember off hand
who they go to, maybe someone else can help with that.
