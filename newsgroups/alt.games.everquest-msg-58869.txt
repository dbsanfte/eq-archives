The main reason is that top posting makes no sense for usenet.  Top
posting *does* make sense in many cases for email, which I'll get to
below.

There are basically two cases for a usenet post.  The first case is
where you are responding to particular points in another post.  In
that case, your post will be most effective if it is in this form:

	> something the other guy said
	
	your answer to that

	> something else the other guy said

	your answer to that

	...

The other case is where you are responding to the thread in general,
and not anything in particular in the prior post, or perhaps you are
responding to the whole prior post.  In that case, you are quoting the
prior post mostly as a convenience to the reader.  Arguably, putting
it at the bottom will be least intrusive, since all you are really
doing is offering it as a convenient reference, rather than something
that should be read again before reading your post.  This is fine for
email, where most email clients aren't threaded, and the recipient may
have deleted the original email.

Usenet, however, is usually read with threaded newsreaders, and the
articles are stored on a server for a week or two or more.  It would
be better, then, to not quote the prior post at all.  If someone wants
to see it again, they can just get it from the server.  Any good
newsreader will have an easy way to fetch the posts that a given post
references.

If you find yourself having to scroll through huge amounts of
duplicate text, you should complain to the poster...they should have
trimmed the quotes.  Just because they followed established convention
and bottom posted doesn't give them a license to be idiots when it
comes to triming.
