Nah, fletching is easier than baking, at least up to 202.  JC is the most 
trivial of the tradeskills, as you can raise it from 0 to 250 without 
ever moving from where you are sitting.  Brewing is probably seconds, as 
you can do the same up to 248 I believe it is.  Pottery is the same up to 
199.  Baking is tougher, there is no way to raise it that high without 
getting dropped components.  Smithing sucks, Tailoring really sucks.  
Fishing is trivial up to the 200 cap.
