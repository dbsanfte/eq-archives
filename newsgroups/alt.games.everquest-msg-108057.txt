You mistakenly thought I was showing care for you and I was explaining my
actual motive.  This comment makes no sense in that context.

But, to address it anyway, you're saying that your abuse is okay because no
one has stopped posting here because of your abuse?

Question: how do you know that?  There's no way to know that.  All you can
really know is that, whoever is posting here is here because they've been
able to endure your abuse.  Anyone who hasn't has left.  That's really fair,
Ben.

I haven't judged you in this, Ben.  I was simply reflecting your own words
"I'm not a better person."

You SHOULD be resilient enough to not be negatively impacted by one person's
negative views.  However, if you ignore MANY people's common view of you,
then you're going down a pretty foolish path.

No mind reading involved here.  I'm simply reflecting on your actions.  If a
person reacts physically to something, it's not rocket science to discern
some of their primary emotions.  When you use angry words and attack people,
then clearly you care about what they've said or done to you.

Not exactly a lofty goal.

People don't forget when you've attacked them, Ben.  You have come at enough
people angrily that you can't claim you don't cry over things said to you.
You whine, complain, attack, abuse...you do it all...but I know you think
you don't.

Such a thread isn't "stooping" to your level.  Au contraire...I think it
would be extremely funny and I bet we could get a lot of people
participating actively.

Come on, Ben!  Wouldn't it be entertaining?

Here's an ironic statement.  That it's not your problem, is probably your
biggest problem.

So, when you attacked me, that was because I was attacking you?  You were
replying to me in the same tone I was using to address you?  You don't
attack anyone, you just defend yourself?  Nothing's your fault?  No
responsibility towards your fellow human beings to not be a titanic asshole?
You're just giving as you get?  If we don't like it, we don't have to come
here in alt.games.everquest, a newsgroup dedicated to EverQuest, because
your abuse is part and parcel to posting in a newsgroup about EverQuest and
if your abuse bothered us, we wouldn't be here in alt.games.everquest?
