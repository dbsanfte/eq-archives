I think you should read my first post again.

I never said wizards sucked and I never said they were worthless. I
said they were not the "first choice" in a pick-up group, and that
compared to all other classes lacked versatility. I am sorry if my
initial comments got you "worked up". I was merely expressing an
opinion. 

I respect your opinion, and your choice of class. 

I just wanted to clear the air between us. Things got a bit heated and
I appolgize. It was never my intention to put down the class or anyone
playing it.

Respectfully

Val
