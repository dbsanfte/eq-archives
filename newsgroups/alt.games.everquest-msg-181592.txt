Hi all,

I run EQ from a hard drive separate from my OS's drives.
I also dual boot drives. (Three HDD's in total)
Now if I run EQ on WinXP (latest graphics drivers) all's dandy just a tad
slow due to system limitations (see previous thread from myself).

However if I boot in a bare bones Win98 (latest Graphics drivers) build,
running EQ from the same drive / build / install as XP ran it from, all the
humans are naked!!!  (Met a really good looking female druid last night !!
:))  Now this doesn't affect gameplay in anyway - doesn't crash etc.... EQ
runs fine.  It's just full of naked humans.  Dwarves etc are all fully
clothed.  If I boot back into XP - they're fully dressed again.

Weird huh?!!

Any ideas?

p.s. If you're a female human toon on the Drinal Server - I'll try not to
look!!!  :P  I'm a good person - truly!!

:)

T.
