I've gone and done it.  I think I've trashed my right hand from all
the gaming and keyboarding.  heh, oh well.  The Ergo guy at work has
me mousing left handed now.  A bit difficult but I find it's getting
easier all the time. 

I've got EQ mapped for lefty play and that seems to be working out
well.  The only problem I have is that the cursor still points to the
LEFT, whereas on my windows desktop it's pointing where it should, to
the right. 

The Guide in chat was no help .. he said set the mouse to "true", but
all I get with /mouse is a prompt for /mousepointerspeedmod.  I
couldn't find a specific in my ini file, so if anyone here knows of
how to fix it, I'd appreciate it.
