Like they said, have a caster (necros druids or bards work well) build
up agro with whatever song/spell works the best, and then have whatever
DPS they have tagging along with them beat on it. This can be melee or
spells. You could agro kite with 6 necros, or 1 necro and 5 warriors,
whatever you want, so long as one caster keeps the agro.
