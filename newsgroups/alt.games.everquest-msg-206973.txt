AH, well, that is true. And also a good reason to deny him a drop. In
fact, they were a bit generous. Had it been my decision and someone
went afk without warning or a good explaination when he came back, he
would have been kicked from the raid completely...Possibly even the
guild all together if it was a primarily raiding guild. I don't care
if it was in a safe spot between fights, you tell the rest of the raid
if you're going afk or you have a damn good excuse when you come back
if you can't tell them before going afk.
