Lots of good advice. Let me muddy the waters a bit. ;-)

I spent several levels there in my mid forties. At your level, you'll do
just fine staying on the entry bridge if you can get the camp open.
There are two spawns just as you come out into the open under the lamp
on the entry to the bridge. Then there are three spawns behind the gate
at the far end. Then, to your right and left, you'll see a balcony up on
each side. There are two spawns on each balcony for a total of nine for
the entry group. Once the gate spawns are clear, you can safely run to
either side and pull the balconies without adds from weird pathing.
Pulling anything else beyond those nine will be a fine and dandy lesson
in bizarre pathing trains. :-)

Other weirdness there to DEFINITELY watch for is the "ghost mobs".
Periodically, your puller (when standing on the balconies) will see
either a goo or a golem walk past, in mid-air above their head, or out
over the water. They're not *really* there. They are up on the roof.
It's just a video bug. They won't aggro on you, but the bitch of it is
that you *can* target them and hit them with an arrow or a spell. If you
do this, there will be a brief lull as the mob disappears. It will then
come down from the high level end of the dungeon with a train of friends
that you will be telling your grandchildren about. (Assuming, of course,
the Reavers don't cut off your balls, feed them to you, and ensure you
can't procreate.) A fun thing to do is to start a train like this and
run for the zone when they show up, but leave one person up on the
balcony to get screen captures. Quite impressive. Just make sure nobody
else is at the zone.

The good loot there is randomized and can drop off any mob in the entry,
temple, courtyard, or goo area. Wraithbone hammers are the most common,
but some other nice items can drop very rarely as well. I'm still using
a sword that I looted there at level 43 or so. (Or at least I was util I
got that velium swiftblade last night, assuming I figure out a good way
to use it.)
