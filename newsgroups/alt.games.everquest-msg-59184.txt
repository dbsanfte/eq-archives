I guess, but 46pp isn't that much really.  Do you have to sell the
fully charged back first?  I guess that if you sell the empty one back
you'll just get two empty ones, ouch!

I can't believe that they would do this, since Verant has stated
several times that multiquesting is part of the game, especially the
high-end game.  Every few months there is a rumor that multi-questing
is being eliminated from the Test server on the VERY NEXT PATCH!!!  It
never turns out to show up on Test, let alone live servers.  Velious
armor is one of the few items that almost needs to be multiquested,
just because you need a raid-force to get it and it's so sought after.
(My guild handles it by having kill group loot and report to officers,
then after each ToV session, which is typically 3-4 days, class reps
come up with each classes request for that round.  Once you're
assigned a piece, you get with officer for your gems, then set up a
time to meet with the person holding the drop for the MQ.  This
ensures that drops go to the correct people, and nothing gets wasted.
We had about 20 chain drops last night, probably more drops than we
had chain-wearers at the end.  This way you can distribute drops to
deserving people rather than lucky people.  I would think if they were
really worried about it, they would just make the final item drop,
rather than the quest pieces.)
