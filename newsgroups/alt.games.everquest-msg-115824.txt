The hardest task ahead of you is finding a guild that fits your
personality. If your server has a message board or Web site, head over
there and see if you can find a listing of guilds. Most active guilds
will have a Web site and message board of thier own. Hopefully you
will be able to find info that indicates the maturity level and goals
of the different guilds.

The next step is to /who in popular zones. Try to join pick-up groups
with members of the guild(s) you are interested in. Ask if you can tag
along with them on raids and such (most organized guilds will have an
events list on their Web site).

The process will take work on your part. It's like finding a good job.
You have to put forth the effort to identify who you want to work for,
before you submit an application.
