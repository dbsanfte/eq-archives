Don't know what groups you get, but most I have been in finish in an
hour or so.  I almost always am in one within 5 mins of putting on my
LFG flag.

Yes, I know of one of those loot whores I met in the beginning.  He's
never gotten a group with me again nor with anyone else I know of.

I see nothing wrong with me having preferential dungeons.  As a shammy
those would be Rujarkian UNTIL I get my Bane spell and Miragul after
that UNTIL I earn enough points to allow me to buy armor. I prefer
those dungeons then if the group want to do another adventure it's
their call.  Sorry it's my buck and I say where I go.  Don't like it? 
Tough...  However once I get the required points in my dungeons of
choice to ALLOW me to buy armor, they are all open.

First part is your opinion, of course.  Last night I stepped into BOT,
which had 20 people in it.  I suppose that could be a good thing, of
course.  I wouldn't miss the crowds, the trains, the arguing.

Speaking for myself and not the original poster, my equip for a 65
shammy with 100+ AA and in a small family guild, I have fairly crappy
armor.  I make up for it with my brain, something that excellent armor
cannot compensate for.  I am never wanting for groups, get invited to
guild raids from other guilds, etc... I'm happy, although must say a
bit envious.
