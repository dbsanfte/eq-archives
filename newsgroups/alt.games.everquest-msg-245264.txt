My ranger's just a squirt but at level 11, I will say they are cheaply
twinkable; with a relatively cheap bow and arrows that I'd say are being
dumped on the market due to skillups (acrylia), I was firing at a mob,
walking backwards, mob would walk away (why??), walking forward, mob walked
to me, fired bow, etc, till beastie was dead.  That tactic seems to work in
GFay, i presume there's some bug in pathing there?


I'm trying to get my 1hb up with a centi hammer. You can really own
crushbone by selling pads and belts, and buying sow and ds potions. My
swimming is about 3 so things don't go so well when i fall in the moat, but
it is most amusing leaping about sniping at legos.

I heard the developers felt archery was too powerful and were considering
nerfing it. I can see why.
