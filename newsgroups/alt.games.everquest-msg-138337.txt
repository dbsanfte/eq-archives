You are arguing a different point, silly.

Try and keep to one point at a time. Too many at
once will only confuse you.

Thats not all you were saying though, is it? 

You made the erroneous conclusion, that if the
above were true, I must also own in-game items.

While the above is a glaring example of the
"bleedin' obvious", the conclusion is as devoid of
logic, as you are of lucid thought.

You are projecting. 

I'm not the one who believes I have owership of
items in a fictional fantasy world. On the
contrary, it is you who cannot see the difference
between the two worlds.
