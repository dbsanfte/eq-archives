LoL...I know of no guild that got a bad rep this way.  It is always the
guilds that sweep in on camps, no notice, and think they can just run others
off because of their uberness.  I can't count the number of times my guild
(small, friendly, ALWAYS in consideration of others) has been run off of
place by the guilds whose only consideration is farm, farm,
farm.....personally, I would 100% of the time prefer a good guild/good
reputation/make new friends over "friends" who have treated others so badly
they now have a "tarnished" reputation....read "we are big jerks whose only
concern are ourselves".....

be safe always,

Alexa
