Sheesh, each time I learn something about this game, it brings more and more
questions!

So, I finally found out that Fire Opals are only found in Solusek Ro off a
character called Genni (level 34-35 or so I hear)...

Can I buy them from her or do I have to kill her?

If  I can buy them, how much do they cost?

If I have to kill her, will I take a faction hit?

Are the Fire Opals lore?


Best regards,


Lowbie
