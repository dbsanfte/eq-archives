Take a look out of your window... how many of the cars out there were built
in Detroit... and how many in Yokohama?

Okie, here's another example of how American citizens are unclear over their
own legal system... specifically, The War Powers Act.


Under this picec of legislation, declarations of War by the United States
can only be made by Congress, not the President. Although the President is
also Commander-in-Chief of the military, he is not allowed to deploy troops
overseas for more than 90 days without seeking Congressional approval. Any
deployment in excess of 60 days has to be refered back to Congress where
they have the opportunity to review circumstances and, if Congress deems it
neccessary, order the recall of any or all military personel. This recall
can take NO LONGER than an additional 30 days.

HJR 77/SJR 2 was Congress' authorisation for President Bush to continue the
deployment of troops already commited to Desert Shield (resetting the 60 day
clock), authority to act "as a member state of the UN" to enforce compliance
with Security Council Resolution 678 (use of offensive force), and to keep
Congressional leaders informed of the situation.

Here is the text of Section 5b, as referenced in the above article...
"(b) Within sixty calendar days after a report is submitted or is required
to be submitted pursuant to section 4(a)(1), whichever is earlier, the
President shall terminate any use of United States Armed Forces with respect
to which such report was submitted (or required to be submitted), unless the
Congress (1) has declared war or has enacted a specific authorization for
such use of United States Armed Forces, (2) has extended by law such
sixty-day period, or (3) is physically unable to meet as a result of an
armed attack upon the United States. Such sixty-day period shall be extended
for not more than an additional thirty days if the President determines and
certifies to the Congress in writing that unavoidable military necessity
respecting the safety of United States Armed Forces requires the continued
use of such armed forces in the course of bringing about a prompt removal of
such forces."

(a full copy of the War Powers Act is here...

This is NOT a declaration of war againt Iraq... this is Congress showing
'The People' it is keeping up with it's Oversight responsibilities with
regards military operations conducted by the US President acting in his
capacity as Commander-in-Chief.

Congratulations... 2 mistakes in 1 sentance... it's not a simple thing, and
I'm not wrong.

The AC-130 Gunship carries a M102 105mm cannon modified from an old M1A1
Howitzer. Firing a 35lb shell, at a rate of 6-10 rounds per minute, from a
load of 100. I'd consider this a bomb if it landed on MY head... although
the title of the article you refer to ("U.S. Probe Justifies Bombing Afghan
Wedding, Killing Dozens") already agrees with my initial statement.

The heaviest weapon reported as being on the ground is the russian built
DShK 12.7mm (0.5") heavy machine gun. This might pose a threat to an AC-130
(which are relativly fragile, despite the added armour), so I'm guessing the
orders were something along the lines of "fly over at 3-5000 feet and
saturate the area."

... effectivly... "carpet bombing"
