Even if it were so trivial to simply publish a game on the scale of 
Everquest. (And its not). You're still failing to recognize that it 
wouldn't be everquest. If microtransactions are retrofitted to 
Everquest, thats it, everquest players will have either suck it up, or 
abandon their level 70 characters with 400AAs.

They can't take those characters with them.

Everquest is a micro-monopoly. If I'm playing chess at your house and 
you go and change the rules I can go play chess somewhere else. I don't 
have to quit playing chess and take up checkers. One does not have that 
choice with MMORPGs.

That's actually irrelevant. This discussion isn't about whether or not I 
have the option of choosing to quit watching TV or play mmogs entirely. 
Its about whether I have the option to watch TV in the manner that I 
prefer.

So what? I don't need logos for that. I know what channel I'm on, my 
digital box tells me the station name, whats on, whats on next, whats on 
next tuesday, and so on at the push of a button. 

In addition they flash their own station commercials during commercial 
breaks to remind me in case I've gone brain dead. There is no need for 
the logos bouncing around during the actual content. And no way to avoid 
it if it offends you.

(Sure you could make some ridiculous suggestion about how I could not 
watch any TV, but that undermines your own premise that if people want 
something someone will provide it. If I have to stop watching TV then 
clearly someone is NOT providing it.

Same could very well happen to MMOGS.

And now we have a few hundred channels all owned by a few corporations.

If only it were an actual free market, then it would actaully be -good-. 
A few hundred channels owned by a few hundred companies.
