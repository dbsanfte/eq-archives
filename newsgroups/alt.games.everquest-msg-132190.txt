Yes, there is more to the PC than just Windows, but the hardware itself is 
shite, no matter how much performance they have squeezed out of it over the 
years. It's still full of horrible, horrible kludges (BIOS, anyone? bah.) 
that there is just too much inertia to change. I like open systems, but I 
like even more *good* systems. I was a SGI user before I was a PC user, and 
when SGI started building their own PCs, the first thing they did was trying 
to fix a few of the things that were fundamentally broken with the 
architecture... Of course, their efforts were for nil.

I've owned many different computers since the eighties; I've been using PCs 
since the mid-nineties. I have used professionally Amigas, PCs, SGIs and 
Macs. I know we have people here whose experience goes back to the 
seventies, but I'm not exactly a newbie either.

I'm sorry you don't get us, but I'm still buying a Mac. :)
