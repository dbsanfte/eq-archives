Feign death causes all the mobs who where chasing you to forget you while
you stay feigned and at low levels for them to forget you permantly .

Instill doubt is a very short duration fear effect on a mob . It works
against mr so fails against many of the harder mob types . You can only
increase in skill if the skill roll suceeds so at a minimum prime it with 30
or so practice points and be prepared to hit that button for the next 50
years .

Eagle strike will take over . All of  the monk special attack types gray out
together .
