Joined a guild (my first in about 9 months, definately first on this 
character) this evening, with the hopes that as advertised its a 
combination of people to group with, people to do epic and other light 
tasks with, and a raid force that I don't have to show up for but 
usually am welcome with.

Not a whole lot of action tonight on the grouping front, I ended up 
soloing another level out in Dulak.  Then my chanter friend logged on 
and I was about to form up an LDoN with her when someone asked for 
guildmates to kill Rotgrime.

Well, I'm game.  So I end up (as I recall being typical with most guilds 
I've been in over the 5 years I've been playing) sitting at the form up 
spot for most of an hour, alone at first, then with a few stragglers.

Monk plays around trying to figure out the pull, back and forth, nearly 
dead repeatedly, can't seem to split them.  Finally the force has gone 
from one group to a small raid of nine, when the monk tries one trick 
too many and dies.  Now the mage goes out and tags Rotgrime who comes in 
to play along with the General and his pet.

I've had Rotgrime on my backup target for ages now, so its easy for me 
to pick him out and go to work.  To my surprise, I'm able to hit him 
fairly regularly, and for my normal damage output more or less.  After 
I'm sure MT has aggro I throw a stun just to see, its resisted.  I try 
another, though, after a Malo type message, and it sticks.  I chain stun 
and they all stick, in fact, although I do end up getting aggro for it a 
couple times, usually not, because the MT has 4 seconds to reestablish 
aggro after the stun lands.

Anyway, things go pretty smoothly, and to my surprise I end up getting 
the kill shot in; I know thats pretty much a matter of luck, but it does 
show the raid that I was actually landing some damage, or at least one 
shot :)

The general's pet is already dead, but the General himself is being off 
tanked and isn't close to gone.  Turn on him, to find out he's immune to 
stun; oddly my axe gives me its normal stick message, but there's one 
right after saying he's immune to the stun portion... like there's any 
-other- portion!  None that I know of anyway.  He's also very irritated 
by my effrontery in trying.  I get knocked around pretty good for a 
while till the SK manages to get aggro back off me; I've actually turned 
off attack by now, which isn't something I do often.  No more stuns, in 
fact I toss in a jolt axe, and we get him down to running and then dead.

So, an hour of my time, for about 10 minutes worth of actual raid, 
including 5 minutes of killing.  But I don't feel too bad about it, I 
read the paper and had a nice snack waiting, I haven't had much real 
down time while playing in a long time, either I'm killing or I'm 
pulling or I'm actively healing using bandages or something.

Grage, 50 Berzerk, Luclin
