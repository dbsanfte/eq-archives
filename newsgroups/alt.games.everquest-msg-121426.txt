I guess theres two ways to look at that.  One way I suppose is that I should
be pleased as punch to be able to see my current EXP and AAEXP levels with a
numeric amount and a handy percentage of some total number.  The other and
utterly depressing fact is that the experience I have at 55 adds up to about
29% of the total exp possible.  Makes sense after what I already knew about
the exp gain in EQ but man, knowing after 55 levels you aint even half way
to the end is a huge kick in the nuts.

I wub joo showeq!
