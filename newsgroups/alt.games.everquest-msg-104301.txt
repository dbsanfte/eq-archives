There are a lot of robes that monks can wear, so I'm sure that was a monk
you saw.  They can dish out major damage and have a class-based boost on
AC.  One of my alts is a level 21 iksar monk on Tallon Zek.  They are fun to
play, as is my level 38 bard, and my level 17 enchanter.  Bard is getting
the most play these days.
