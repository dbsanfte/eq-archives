You forgot connectivity.  Where are you going to host this thing?

Another nice thing about webboards is that you can easily keep the posts 
there indefinately.  With email everyone has to save all the messages, or 
you don't have them to refer to.  If you set up your own news server, you 
could store the info there, but then would have to explain to everyone how 
to set up their newsreader to show all messages vs. just unread messages, 
and then you'd have some ass like me wanting to be able to use TIN or 
something, and then it just gets messy.
