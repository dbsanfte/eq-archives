Writing over open files isn't a big problem.  Given a copy of VtoolsD
(a VxD development library that deals with most of the grunge work in
writing a VxD), it would take me maybe a couple of hours (a day at
mose) to write a dynamically loadable file system hook VxD for Win
9x/Me that would remove all those restrictions on what you can do open
files.

Basically, the way it would work is it would change it so files are
*NOT* kept open, but get closed after every operation.  Any operation
on the file opens it, does the operation, and closes it again.
Applications would *think* they have the files open, but they wouldn't
really.

You can have a lot of fun with file system hook VxDs in Windows 9x/Me.
