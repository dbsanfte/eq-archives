You have to be level 51 to pick the lock in the bank.

You can use detect traps anywhere, just hit it as soon as it ungreys. 
For disarm traps, take the boat from oasis to Timorous Deep.  You don't
state you level, so, you may need to use sneak/hide, but the fire
cauldrons at the shore side of the dock where the boat to OT stops, has
a trap that will drop invis *INCLUDING* sneak hide.  You can just go
around rather than through and your fine, stand on the dock and just
click away on your disarm traps hot key.

Pickpocket can be trained on virtually any mob.  I don't use it when
grouped however.  I play a Barb. Rogue, and would train pickpocket on
the goblin camp in Everfrost between the 1 guard and 3 guard spawns on
the edge of the Tundra.  Even if you aggro them, they don't hit often,
and you can just pick away while looking for a group, or during med
breaks.  As i leveled up I would often pick on the fly in everfrost, I
would often pull Mammoths for a Shaman partner and I or a few others to
kill.  I would hit pickpocket as I ran past the Orcs on the tundra,
generally you won't aggro them, after level 27 (IIRC might be 28), and
just keep moving.  Now that I am 42 I usually pick the guards in
Freeport on my way to the bank, have gotten Kite Shields a few times
which sell for a few pp.
