 Relative to what he has now, that is.  You could kill him easily back
then with three groups. Blind/DoT was annoying since the Cures weren't
yet found. Basically to get rid of the dot we'd just wait until we had
like 50 HPs or something and zone, since that would strip the dot (with
your buffs). For the blind we'd park him in a corner and our main tank
would be dual boxing so that if he got blinded he could still position
him. His HP upgrades from when we first killed him were fairly
noticeable.

 Learning the strategy is fun. Once you got it down (which doesn't take
long) it becomes tiring to go back there all the time.
