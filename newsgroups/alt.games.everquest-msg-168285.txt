Those who set out with the sole purpose of advertising themselves and
spamming their services are getting away from the core object and
atmosphere of the game. They are selling their experience for plat.
They could be levelling and progressing in the game - exploring,
polishing skills, you know, what the game was meant to be.

I'm not saying that porting should not be a valuable service. If
someone shouts out for a port, then by all means, send them a tell and
port them for profit. I have just always looked upon several porters
all spamming their business to make a buck as a detraction from the
game. It cheapens *my* experience anyway. It just doesn't seem druid-
or wizard-like at all.
