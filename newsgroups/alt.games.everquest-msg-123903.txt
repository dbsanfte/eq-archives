Hmm, I suggest having someone put a long lasting root on a mob, then
trying charm over a long period of time with various Cha and (in the
case of bards) instruments.

Personally, I have an obviously low cha (under 100, surely if there's
a break point at all thats going to be one) and don't equip an instrument
at all and still find charm stick rate and duration to be more than
adequate for hunting purposes.. for charm kiting purposes I should
say.  Perhaps I'll borrow my 25 cha stiens from my main and test
with those, that could give me a 50 cha swing up to around 145 or so...
then if I can scam a spware shaman for the project I can get another
what, 50 cha on top of that?

The other cha point I'd suspect of having some effect would be 75,
thats frequently a plateau on the effectiveness slope for stats.  My necro
did have some trouble with charms, I'm not sure thats due to low
cha, at the time I just thought that low level necro charms weren't
very effective... but now I wonder if his CHA in the low teens didn't
have some influence.

I Strongly suspect that CHA has no effect at all on fear, having run
a high elf cleric (CHA over 115 for most of the 49 levels) and a
dwarf cleric (CHA sitting at 50 for most of  59 levels) I've never noticed
any difference in fear sticks or durations
