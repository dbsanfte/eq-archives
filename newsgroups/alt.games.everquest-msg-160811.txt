The Lesser Summon Corpse Spell, level 12, uses the cheap 3pp
non-stackable coffins.  (I think they're called Tiny Inlaid Coffins
or something like that.)  It can summon any corpse up to level 35.

The Summon Corpse Spell, level 39, uses the expensive 168pp (at
least that's what I'm charged) non-stackable *container* coffins
(so you can't even put them in a backpack!).  I think they're
called Jade Inlaid Coffins.  It can summon any corpse.

(What has always bugged me about this is that a Necro cannot
summon his own corpse from level 36 through 38.)

The Conjure Corpse Spell, level 57, uses the midrange 50pp stackable
coffins.  (Don't know what they're called, sorry.)  It too can
summon any corpse.

I'm told that most merchants who sell backpacks also sell coffins.
I usually buy mine in Bazaar, in the building between the banks,
at the first vendor on the left.

My necro is only level 55, and I've only had to summon a corpse
four or five times (mostly my own), so I apologize for any errors
or omissions!
