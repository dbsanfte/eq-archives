It would be if it were always simple black-and-white, but that's not
the case. Naming violations have all kinds of shades of gray.
Wantsomedrinks is flat out moronic stupid, and doesn't fit into a
fantasy theme at all. But the occasional NPC 'joke' names don't break
the mood, for me at least.

Know what I thought the first time I saw Bait Masterson? "I wonder if
he's going to kill me". The second time I saw him, my thoughts were
"Hey, isn't that the guy I saw in Qeynos a week ago?"

It was only about the third time that I realized that if I crossed my
eyes and breathed heavily, I could rearrange the name into something
naughty - and even that is just a product of *my* imagination, since
the name is actually a tip of the hat to Bat Masterson.

If all the dumb PC names were as innocuous as the NPC names, I
wouldn't have ever had cause to petition one.
