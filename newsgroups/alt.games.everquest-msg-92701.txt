    Well, I hadn't lost it on this debate until I read today's installment
of "Jazz gets defensive". Still, I'll try to be civil.

    But WHY would they go to zone X to get weapons when better weapons that
take LESS TIME TO GET drop in zone Y? Are they just stupid? Having that
Primal proc is great against high AC mobs like some of the ones in Luclin,
but it's not worth wasting the time of the entire guild to go get. The
"lesser" guilds on my server have stopped getting keys to ST because there's
no point - they seem to have come to the same conclusion I have about time
vs. reward.

    Nice snip on the rest, Jazz. YOU like neat models, so I put that in
there for YOU. Did you notice how every other part that you just snipped
said it was about lewt?

    Time vs. Reward. You ain't killing the first brood a second time just so
you can go waste time farming drops that are "teh suck" in a post-awakening
Sleeper's. Again, on my server ZLandicar dies (because of the phat lewt
Heart they can sell in EC), Lend dies (for her phat lewts), and that's it.
The rest aren't killed unless the world is empty of targets because, guess
what, the risk and time vs. reward is junk. Do you really think guilds spend
time on stuff that takes forever to do and has no tangible reward? Try and
motivate 40 or 50 people to do something "just 'cause", I dare you.

    Hardly. I told you, time and time again, why I don't like raiding
guilds: they demand your time. I found a raiding guild that does NOT demand
my time because they're twice the size of any other raiding guild I've ever
seen and always have good numbers online. Does that sound like a flip in
philosophy? It does if all you took out of our discussion is "guilds r teh
suck", which would be sad.

    No, Jazz, what's sad is I can tell you things until my fingers bleed and
you still just don't get it. I told you what rings to get when you were
little. "Upgrade from Jagged Bands to Plat Fire rings? Doesn't look that
useful!" says Jazz. What rings are you wearing now? I tell you how Harmonium
will act to you when your guild comes into conflict with them. "Pooh pooh!"
says Jazz. Then, later on talking about his guild, he mentions the friction
that he's started to experience. Sometimes I wonder why I bother to tell you
anything about a part of the game you haven't yet experienced, since you
seem hell-bent on ignoring me.

    It certainly wasn't you. You were the one saying how I was clearly not a
team player, a soloist, how I was selfish, and any other number of insults
for not wanting to commit my entire gaming time to doing something I may or
may not want to do "in the name of the guild".

    NOBODY else has done? Excuse me, but if it weren't for FoH publishing
HOW to do it half the servers WOULDN'T have done it when they did. After the
first few guilds EVERYONE knew what would happen, because OTHERS HAD ALREADY
DONE IT. Say it along with me, Jazz - OTHERS HAD ALREADY DONE IT. Repeat it
again - OTHERS HAD ALREADY DONE IT. You feel that being first on a slow-ass
server is an accomplishment? When someone from my server (not the guild that
woke him) posted to Noows about Quellious waking the Sleeper, the most
telling post of all was one of the bigwigs from BotS (the first guild to
wake the Sleeper) posting a one word response: "Why?"

    Do you want to know what makes me happy about killing the AoW? Not the
"accomplishment" - it's been done by others on other servers, it might have
even been doable by the other top guild on my server. If it isn't a
cross-server first, it's crap as far as "achievement" goes. It's the simple
fact that now we have one more challenging fight per week that we can engage
in. There's now more for us to do. That's fun. Killing the Sleeper takes
away things for people to do. That's not fun.

    It isn't me that cares. Cleric loot didn't drop there (or, rather,
nothing I'd care to use - pass on the Primal 2HB, thx), and my guild has
better. I care about the guild below us, that was well and truly screwed
(they had about ten keys when Sleeper was released), and everyone below
them.

    No. I was talking about farming Ventani using an in-house strategy,
because he was one tough mofo.

    Nope, can't say I did.

    And where did THIS come from? Did I say some secret code word that set
off the tinkered gnome brain implants or something? Copying strats = lame.
Original strats = good. There's my summary, hope it doesn't set off the
Tourette's again. (Sorry, I edited out the other stuff but I liked this too
much to remove it.)

    Yup. They (I wasn't a member then) had killed Aaryonar and were heading
in. The guild that had the monopoly wanted to get the phat Vulak lewts and
tried to CotH past the first guild to the safe spot. But they rushed, and
just as they trained themselves the first guild arrived at the safe spot and
also got wiped. In the aftermath it was "strongly suggested" that NToV go to
rotation if the first guild could clear it, to avoid similar incidents on
mobs that DID have rotations set forth. I believe the phrase "Will this be
the precedent?" was used. :-)

    Sucks that the second guild did what they did - they were the first ones
to espouse a "First Come First Serve" philosophy on the server that
respected raids in progress. But I guess they didn't want to lose Vulak, and
if you look at those drops you can kind of understand why. It's the only
case where they've been that crazed - even recently, the two guilds have
made agreements on trying top encounters (we got to keep trying AoW, they
have the Burrower encounter).

    Um, no. Read it again. There's already a third guild that looks like
they'll take a spot in the NToV rotation. That's more than cool - welcome to
NToV! But once you start getting to the point where people are waiting a
month to get something they want, you're going to have problems. If ANY of
the guilds in the rotation - and the more guilds there are, the more likely
it is to happen - slack, show favourtism to another rotation guild, jump the
queue during multiple repatch periods, there's going to be a whole lot of
problems.

    Ideally, you want every mob that drops something worthwhile dead before
its feet hit the ground from respawning. It gets guilds done with encounters
sooner (they get loot faster), so they can move on and make space for
up-and-coming guilds. As long as guilds aren't competing for the same
things, the server doesn't have inter-player strife. Some top-tier guilds
favour making the intermediate encounters tougher after the top guilds are
done/near-one with them, to increase the time it takes for a lower guild to
complete them and lengthen the gap between the top and second-tier. Despite
being in a top-tier guild now, I don't favour that solution. I am strongly
for rotations, though, because they help alleviate the tensions that would
otherwise surround spawns.

    At least the last part of that is true - "pfffft" on my server, indeed.

    Ideally, you'd try. Hell, yes. You'd learn something that could be

    More than if you released the Sleeper, yes.

    (1) This argument has been pulled out on every top-level mob in the
game. "Oh, why nerf the stats on Mrylokar's Dagger when only half a percent
of players will ever see Vulak?" Then, one month later, "Our server has four
guilds on rotation in NToV - make Vulak harder so it isn't crowded for us!"
I've been hearing this argument in one form or another since Trakanon. Given
time and mudflation, all these top mobs will tumble. Hell, Jazz, I bet your
guild is ready to start killing Zlandicar (if you can find him up). Did it
take some miracle of rocket science to get YOU to that stage? No. Just time,
and mudflation.
    (2) As I pointed out above, people stop getting keys when the Sleeper is
woken. There's no point. So your statement may be right, but not for the
reason you thought. :-)

    Well, they aren't a typical example (nor did I say they were), but they
aren't too far from the norm. We have a guild that wants a stranglelock on
the top-end encounters on their server. What's the first thing they think of
doing? Release the Sleeper and screw everyone else. Every split server from
now on will have the exact same thing happen, unless the actual encounter is
changed somehow. And remember - the core of Township Rebellion is
Vindication from DRo. Just some guild, like any other.

    Lord, Jazz, read it again. They didn't even WANT to release the Sleeper
until they thought it would punish someone. There was no competition for
Warders. There was already a rotation agreement in place for farming the
three that were being killed, and accomodations had been made to allow the
one guild to try to kill Ventani without releasing the Sleeper. Then they
got mad that they couldn't keep a monopoly on NToV, the archery technique
was published, and BOOM - Sleeper awake on Quellious. Try and tell me that
they thought waking the Sleeper, and experiencing the script firsthand, was
the "big prize" they were after.

    Read above. Explain why guilds across all servers released him only when
up-and-coming guilds entered areas that were previously monopolized by one
guild. Or why "they got ten Sleeper's keys, time to wreck the zone!" was a
common battle cry. You can't possibly be so innocent that you believe that
the guilds at the top of a server's pecking order are motivated by something
that nerfs them.

    We killed the AoW - server first. I mentioned it in one post as a
passing reference to show I wasn't in a second-tier guild, as then I'd be
accused of "boohooism and jealousy". I didn't post "we r0x0rs" because,
well, we don't. Others have killed him, we're Johnny-come-lately on this,
and so it means squat on that level. What can I say - I don't cheer for the
people who finish 20th at the Olympics, and I don't understand why defensive
players have orgasms after damn near every tackle in the NFL.

    Lord, Jazz, are you being obtuse on purpose? I am a cleric. Nothing
worth having drops in Sleeper's for a cleric pre-awakening. If anything, I'd
be happy - there's now a one-in-a-bajillion chance of getting a prismatic
scale there which would allow me to turn a POS Sleeper's key into something
quite nice (the ranged slot item, earring, and ring are really slick). I
simply didn't value seeing Kerafyrm attack other PCs, and possibly NPCs (no
idea how wide his aggro is - may have been able to stay outside it), over
staying in a Velk's group and getting XP.

    Oh, hell yes! BotS was the first guild to kill Ventani legit (and
release the Sleeper), and kudos to them. They had no idea WHAT would happen,
so I can't point a finger at them and say "you screwed your server on
purpose!" Even THEY wish they hadn't done it, but they didn't know what it
would do.

    Anyone who knew what would happen when they did it and did it anyways
gets the "asshole" label. If you think that's hypocracy and can't see the
difference I have no idea what I can say to you on the subject.

    Excuse me? I made mention of our "attempt" agreement before, I'll
mention it again. The Burrower encounter and the AoW were two encounters on
our server that only two guilds have a shot at, mine and one other. Rather
than rush each other to die to them first, or split time on each, we agreed
that they would get to try Burrower every chance they wanted, and we'd do
AoW every time we could, until we'd solved the mob. Then (they have yet to
solve Burrower) we'd switch off. We didn't care what loot dropped off what
mob, we made a decision that gave each guild maximum time to learn an
encounter that nobody on our server had done. Once both guilds have mastered
these mobs, they become part of the rotation and hopefully we move on from
other encounters. Does it sound like we're unhappy unless we get it all?
