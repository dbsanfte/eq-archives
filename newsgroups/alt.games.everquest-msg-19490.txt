Bards solo great! 

But........

It can take a LONG time, and you need a lot of open space. 

When people talk about the "best" soloing classes, they are referring
to how quickly a class can kill and how much down time between fights.
Bards do not kill quickly, and have almost zero downtime. Still other
classes will crank out the exp a lot faster. (Levels 30 and under
anyway :-P)
