I don't see anything wrong with selling buffs/heals/ports, any more than i
have a problem with a high level warrior charging keeping the camp broken
for a group that couldn't handle the spawns otherwise. With the nexus, and
working boats, low levels can get most anywhere now, and my customers are
usually heading for a raid *now* and willing to pay a lot, and I'm willing
to drop everything to accomodate them.

That said, if anyone wants to hitch a ride, all they really have to for me
is find a paying customer, and they will probably find that if that person
doesn't go exactly where they want, they will be close, or able to access
the nexus. I don't have a problem with giving sow or buffs away to anyone
who doesn't demand it. Mind you, the dreaded "sow plz" is enough to make me
lose interest real fast. I assume low levels have it hotkeyed. When I was a
young lad, i always paid 2 pp for a sow. I raised my barbarian shaman to
high enough level that he could cast it, and then found noone was interested
in actually paying for something they seem to feel essential. So the barb
got shelved and the druid was born.

I don't have a problem with porting untwinked types for 5 gold (assuming
danger free)or for a couple of stacks of bone chips or batwings or fish.
Someone who does that has earnt a port in my book. But if you feel a port is
your right, grab a taxi, and tell the driver to take you to the airport,
pronto, and not to expect any payment, and see how far it gets you...

The other night i was helping out a friend in paludial, when these guys
decided they had the bandits at the entrance camped. Now most camps are
clearcut; take the dervish or orc camps. But the one at the entrance is a
hazard; you aggro just by running through. It's really 2 camps as well, the
left and the right groups of huts, and i think 2 groups is really required
to keep that area spawn free. One group just stares at the spawns while the
healers med, and swears at passers by, unless they have uber alts farming
phat lewt, like the monk who kill stealed off of my mate.

So we move on, and get used to the cry of train every five minutes as the
bandits sweep over them, and i get a kick out of realising that these were
the guys i was helping out before with snares and damage shields and regen,
who repaid me with bullying as soon as they'd levelled enough to get cocky.
They got killed, probably got others killed, and got themselves on my ignore
list (goodbye ports from me), all because of their stupidity and greed.
