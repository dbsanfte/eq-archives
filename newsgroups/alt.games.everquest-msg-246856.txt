Oh no no no, Bizbee!  That's not it!  It's just that FoH gets there
faster than we do and finds these exploits, but they don't use them to
farm the hell out of an area before any other guilds can get to it
before reporting the bugs to get them fixed!  I mean, ask any FoH
fanatic - If it weren't for FoH we wouldn't be in the game we're in
today!  The game would be so bugged up, classes would be out of whack,
items would be poofing every time you logged off...  The list goes on! 
We should be morning the loss of FoH and Furor.  *cough*
