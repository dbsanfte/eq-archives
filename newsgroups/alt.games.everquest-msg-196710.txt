Yes it does, auto. You update your profile, and it says how much is from 
stats etc. For example my 28 enchanter is at the end of this post.

Magelo is quite cool actually (if you have the premium subscription). 
Very useful if you are in a small / growing guild and need to know what 
is a trash drop and what is an upgrade for that new warrior that joined 
last week. The fact that you can compaire upgrades and alternative 
set-ups (resist gear etc.) is handy too. And the Item dB is great in 
terms of raw data.

I really think that you need to get another web browser, NS 4.7 has a 
great news reader, but the browser does not cut it any more. Get Opera.
