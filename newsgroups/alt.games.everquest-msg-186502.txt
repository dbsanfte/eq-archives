Not true.  My sister is best friends with a girl whose family lives 
beside a lake.  Guess where we used to go all the time every summer?  
The first trip is fun, but if you have to be at the lake to do something 
- ie swimming lessons - you're not going to enjoy the drive an  hour and 
back every day for months on end.  It's like that with EQ - my first 
boat trip, I will always remember, but my 50th boat trip, I wish I could 
forget. :P
