I got him about 10 times in Sro and made a tidy profit MQing the boots. 
(Bought my KEI spell for 35k from it back in the day)
Here are a few things to know...

He only spawns at night.
There are a number of special spawns which are placeholders for him. I 
forget them all, and most are obvious, but there are a couple which arn'y. 
"A mummy" is one to watch out for. Kill it and watch the tracking list (if 
youre a druid) and the next spawn will appea at the top of the tracking 
list.

Its exactly the same as quillmane in SKarana with a number of special spawns 
with very unnoticeable names that can be killed to spawn him. Once you find 
one of the special spawns its easy to keep finding them because they appear 
at the top of your track window.

The same thing happens in frontier mountains too, except there are 3 sets of 
spawns there. The one in the southwest is often hard to pickup because the 
placeholder is usually "a hill giant" amount other hill giants.

Another zone the same thing happens is rathe mountains, and this is the 
spawns thatthe gnome is in for the boots handin. Again, one of the spawns is 
"a drake", but in this cae there are not other "a drake"'s that spawn in the 
zone.
