Qeynos Hills is also on a continuous cycle- Around 1 am every night the MOBS
depop and are replaced by
Varsoons Undying Army. The undead invasion lasts until someone Kills Varsoon

no rare or even magic drops to my knowledge though someone said that Varsoon
(Not Pyzjin) carried a GBS on him when killed as well -  but I cannot verify
that sadly.
