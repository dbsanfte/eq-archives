Perhaps we can agree to disagree. I know a thing or two about computers as I've
been programming professionally for over 25 years. 

I agree that periodic maintenance is required absolutely for production systems.
I don't agree that a functional non-revenue-generating home-gaming /
Quicken-running / web-surfing PC ever needs to be touched unless absolutely
necessary. The system I built 3.5 years ago for home use did everything I wanted
it to do, smoothly, until Dec. 4. I'm happy with the ROI on that system.

I made a choice to do the required upgrades to continue to play a game I enjoy.
I did so despite the fact I'm in the middle of building a new, up-to-date
system. My point is that many others who don't have that luxury are no longer
able to enjoy the world of Norrath and were given no substantive warning to that
effect.
