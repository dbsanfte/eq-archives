Like I said, not the best idea for a cleric task...as tanks we 
suck. I have my clicky pet legs, a full assortment of spells [ i 
have all my spells for all my levels=)] and tend to avoid casters 
when soloing. If clerics had a persistant pet, I could see it, 
because I could get it buffed to the max, but poofy the wonder 
hammer is not particularly great. Our strength would be against 
undeads, now *that* would be a task that makes sense. I could 
handle a similar task in lguk, nailing some undead froggie shaman 
would make me very happy=)
