Cerics can actually nuke better than Druids...

Retribution - 496dam/240mana - 9 sec recast delay
vs
Calefaction - 444dam/250mana - 45 sec recast delay

uhmm... okay, I'll conceed Dam Shields... tho their usefulness falls off
pretty steeply after 30s

Clerics can summon better than Druids... they just can't forage

Not really... you forgot to also mention...

Rezzes... even Pallies can Rez, Druids can't
Stuns... Druids don't get any
Fear... Druids get single animal... Clerics get AE vs ALL (not just Undead)

Druids can at least port?... doh, PoP/Nexus means even a Warrior can get
around as well as a lvl 39 Druid
Snare?... doh, Crystaline Silk Net
Wolfform?... only if you want to be KoS in almost every zone released since
Kunark

And it's not like I begrudge Clerics their CH (at lvl 39)... it's just that
I'd like to be able to cast something a little better than Greater Heal a
tad earlier than 51!!!

Bitter? me??
