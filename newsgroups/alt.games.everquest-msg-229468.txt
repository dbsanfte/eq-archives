To me?

I don't want item decay or "level appropriate only" gear. I realize it's 
a way to prevent twinking and mudflation, but I don't find it attractive.

I don't really want to start all over again finding new friends, and I 
don't really want to start a new character and go through a tedious 
process of figuring out exactly which sort of character suits me best in 
the new game. Took me a year and a half to find that a necro suited me 
thoroughly.

I just don't *want* another game.
