My suggestion: Splitpaw, and dare to go BEYOND THE DOUBLE DOORS!!!!!!  Your
group has the required abilities for this zone: CC and anti-caster skills.
You'll have lots of fun beating up gnolls, taking down casters, getting
crazy adds. Corpse runs are extremely tame as nothing in the zone sees
thru invis. Many groups will only hunt in front of the double doors,
but you'll rarely run across anyone beyond them.

Also, Mistmoore has a lot of good stuff too. I've had lots of mixed
experiences in Lower Guk, so I can't whole-heartedly recommend it.  SolA
or SolB might work -- I forget exactly when you might want to switch over.
Crystal Caverns is great for folks with snare, and is good loot and decent
xp through 37 or so. At 35 you can start doing the grimling caves in
Tenebrous Mts. OT, of course, is possible as well. Lizard island in
Feerrott, perhaps?
