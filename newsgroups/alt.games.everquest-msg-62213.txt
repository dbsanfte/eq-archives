  Yep, I had the same problems with 6-8 with my erudite necromancer, but
they're not really a big deal.  It's easy to get through Erudin to get to
Qeynos if you don't lollygag around the paladin guilds, but getting through
Qeynos can be a bit difficult... you either need somebody to cast
invisibility on you, or you have to go through the catacombs... not too
difficult with a map, but still a bit challenging.  Once you get bound on
the outskirts of Qeynos you're set, though.

  Also, the Warrens can be good if you can get together a small low level
group.  Three or four newbies shouldn't have much trouble handling runts,
guards and rabids near the entrance, so the only real danger is the trains.
And at that level, the money and experience you can make turning in molars
is incomparable.  The Warrens didn't exist when I played my necromancer
through the low levels.

  Somebody gave my necromancer a harvester the other day. :)  It's nice, but
I more appreciated the crystalline robe and black tome with silvery runes
they gave me. ;)  But yeah, nightblindness is pretty much no big deal for
necromancers.  Deadeye's duration is fairly long (one cast will last the
entire night), it's low mana cost, plus it's just cool being able to see
invisible. :P

  Yeah, I tried playing a dark elf magician once, and Nekulous just sucks at
the low levels from what I can tell.  I eventually just took him to the
Freeport newbie yard.

  And they have a bit of an experience penalty, which the original poster is
looking to avoid.  Also, I think their intelligence is kind of low, like par
with humans.  They do also get the inherant AC bonus, which is kind of nice
for casters.

  You got them all. :)  Half-elves can't be necromancers or shadow knights.
