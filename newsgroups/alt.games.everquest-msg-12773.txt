On a related note to this subject...once my 11 warrior was in NRo
trying to get into a derv group. Finally, some guy tells me to come to
the wall camp, to which I promptly reply "Thanks, only my way". The
guy actually has the gall to respond "Just type 'thx, omw'". I stopped
dead in my tracks, told the snert to find himself another warrior, and
decided to switch off to my other character. I've seen people chided
for 1337 sp33k, but that's the first time I've seen anyone get uppity
over someone NOT using it...
