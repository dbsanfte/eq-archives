The only reason I remembered where I was bound is because it was in the
firepot room, which was a non-bindable zone.  I understand that they have
changed this and you are now allowed to bind there.   I bound there 2 days
after Kunark was released, right before they made it non-bindable.   I loved
having a teleporting enchanter.  It made fighting in a few zones difficult,
but I was able to go anywhere pretty quickly.  I made my living by doing the
Stein of Moggock quest.  Could do the whole thing in 30 minutes using the
firepots.
