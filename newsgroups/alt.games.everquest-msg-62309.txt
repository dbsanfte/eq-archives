Any Guild Raid Leader will be happy to explain what he expects out of you on
a plains raid for new raiders. First thing on a Raid LOSE any AoE spells and
Pet spells. As a Shaman you will be expected to buff and regen Tanks and
anyone that asks for buffs. Next if you are the highest Shaman or have the
best slow spell you will be debuffing the mob. Final tip do not go to the
planes untill half way to 47 or better if by some chance you die and lose a
level (to 45) and res does not restore it you cannot get back in to loot
corpse.
