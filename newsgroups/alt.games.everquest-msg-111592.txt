I suspect they will, otherwise the Bardic Cartel will run up to Verant and 
hit them for 3pts, then run away really, really fast.  
Actually, I haven't been able to find any references to bards either, and 
I'm hoping that Verant doesn't just decide that bards are too much trouble 
(songs different than spells, stacking issues, druids whining about not 
being the best soloers).  I think there will be a bard class, but it will 
be more of a hybrid with really short-lasting spells, rather than the 
red-headed stepchild and coding nightmare that bards are now.  They 
haven't given out much real information about how characters specialize, 
but I can certainly see how a fighter or hybrid type could turn into a 
bard.  We're really nothing more than weak tanks until about level 20 
anyhow.
