Actually its a 5 AC and +5 str earring, not ring. Its the AC that is important
to tanks. This WAS a great earring when Kunark came out, since the only tank
earrings worth a damn with ac on them were the Diamondine ( ac 2 + 3 str +15 hp)
earring which was going for 2-3k and the Gold topaz earring which had AC 3 and
+8 disease. However, since the orc fang (ac3 +3 str +15 hp) and cougar claw earrings
(AC4 +3 str, +2 dex) drop so often and are not rare, only 1 ac less than the earring of
station is not as hot an item anymore. Plus its an extremely rare drop, more rare than a
forest loop.
