Have to agree here, having spent a lot of time soloing, and grouping.  When
in a good group, you can pretty much keep pulling nonstop.  In OT lately,
I've been in several groups that can keep pulling mobs that are blue to the
highest group member, red to yellow to most of the group, almost nonstop.
Xp has been awesome.  When I am soloing in OT, I can usually take down a
blue, sometimes a white or yellow, using most or all of my mana plus
possibly cannibalizing for extra.  Then med for a long time.
