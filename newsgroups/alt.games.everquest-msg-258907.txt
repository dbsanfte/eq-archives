Great story, I missed reading your accounts here. But more than that, Breath
and I miss being at your side in CoH, those were some of the most fun either
of us have ever had in any MMOG. We would have enjoyed playing EQ with you
too, I bet (although your uberness is scary, I remember how hard we had
doing Ikkinz trials in those early days, let alone Uqua and Inktu'ta, whew)!

Grats on hitting 38! As I recall, that means you now have access to the
highest of your Secondary powers doesn't it? What powers did you wind up
going with?

Breath says hi!
