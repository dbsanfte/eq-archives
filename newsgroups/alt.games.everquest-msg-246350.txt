Ok, I was talking off the cuff before.  I went and looked up what people 
say the actual faction hit is on the quest, which more or less matched my 
experience:

Kromzek +50
Kromrif +10
Tormax +10
CoV -20 or -25

So, If you're max scowls with Kromzek and max ally with CoV, after 80 
heads you should be max ally Kromzek and indiff or apprehensive with CoV.
You'd still be scowls with Tormy and Kromrif, though.  But like I said, 
they aren't that useful.  Unless you happen to have Yelinak's Head or 
the Dain's head lying about... :)
