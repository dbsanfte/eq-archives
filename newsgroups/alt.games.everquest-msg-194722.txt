Ah. no. it is well deserved.

Unfortunately no, this doesn't always work.
As stated in EQAtlas, they do stalk the walls and they can get you.

One touch of the Undead Knight equals 495 hit points. Erk!.

I have a level 30+ bard, with a Mistmore drum, so runs very fast.
I usually run the top of the zone wall keeping a eye out for the 
few blocking trees. Do not stop. Ever. 

They will hit you if you can see them. If you stop, they get a 2nd hit
in and it can be deadly. The worst night was when I encountered four
along the wall bottom and received 1 Undead Kight touch and another
about half that. I was lucky to make it to Riverdale from West
Commonlands.

Hint, High Pass and Riverdale tunnels had black and white stone around
them, so you know when to head down.

This is where EQatlas is unclear. It states that they have to be cleared
away by higher players. It is refreshing to know that they don't like to
sunlight and go hide.
