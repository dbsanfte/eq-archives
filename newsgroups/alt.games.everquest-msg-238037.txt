The quote that 42 was responding to simply illustrates how people use
"god" to explain the unexplainable. As we find answers, he's pushed
back to the new questions that arise. To others, it becomes more and
more obvious that the mysteries that used to "prove" he existed are
really quite mundane after all.

I'm not saying there's no higher force. Just that he's not what we've
been taught to believe he/she is for so many centuries.
