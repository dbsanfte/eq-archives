Sure you do.  Even with a relatively small guild like the one I'm in (I'm in
charge of knowing who's in the guild...turns out my guess yesterday of 45-50
was wrong...we have almost 65 now) we get a new guild member usually weekly.

There's not much point in guilding much faster than that in my guild.  Hell,
*65* people?  We strive for quality, not quantity.  With the usual "family"
problems of folks not quite getting along (show me any group of 65 people
ANYWHERE that doesn't have any sort of personality conflict) we all have at
least 30 FRIENDS in the guild.  This doesn't count, of course, those friends
who are happy in their own guild or those who've moved on to other guilds
when the personality conflicts were too much.
