While I am sure that what you describe is true in many cases, please 
don't generalize and assume it is always true.  I have just returned 
from a long weekend of travel that allowed me to visit with several of 
my EQ friends.  Two from up north flew into Atlanta to spend a few days 
with me there and see a concert and then I hit Austin for a visit with 
another friend and another concert.

Come April I'll be headed up to Canada for another show and to visit two 
more friends up there.  These last two enjoyed having 5 or 6 of their EQ 
friends fly up for their wedding a couple of years ago (despite the fact 
that we'd never actually met before this in RL) as well as the comfort 
provided by all of us in game when one of them lost a parent.

Again, I'm sure you are right in many cases, folks only care about what 
you can do for them in game, but there are some genuine folks out there 
who actually do become life long friends by playing together.  The sort 
that are not only your buddy when they need your help to kill a monster, 
but when you need a real friend.

Now young faces grow sad and old and hearts of fire grow cold
We swore blood brothers against the wind
I'm ready to grow young again
