Original Message Follows:
-------------------------

PROBLEM 1: Video with "ATI Rage Fury Pro" on WinXP
Screen flickers when in inventory. Interface turns to grey sometimes
coming back to full screen (alternate color of flickering). Turning off
sky is temp fix. Another symptom is trees and other objects appear to
leave trails in the sky.

PROBLEM 2: Sound with "Soundblaster Live!" on WinXP
Sounds are not coming through properly. Reverb gives me something that
sounds like feedback in some areas. When it rains for example, very loud
rain overpowers all other sound.


I have all the latest drivers installed. My hardware meets and exceeds
the game requirements.
