Well, my problems with the beta aside(*) the zones are pretty, the
mobs are neat, they also are a bit on the tough side (50's mobs that
rampage, oh my).  Some of the questable/droppable stuff for 50's and
up is not bad.

(*) they never copied my main over, many of the betabuffed characters
were inaccessible because they were camped in PoT (65 BL comes to mind).
Playing betabuffed characters at any rate is a difficult way to test,
as the abilities are alien enough that you have no good yardstick.
