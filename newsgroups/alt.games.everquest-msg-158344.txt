Here's the current description, from the PoP manual:

    "A Druid is the master of the outdoors and befriends all flora and
    fauna.  Creatures rarely ever attack him unless he attacks first.  He is
    a clerical spellcaster who focuses on all things natural, allowing him
    to call upon Nature for aid and defense"

Hmmm...."Creatures rarely ever attack him"?  I sure see a lot of scowling
creatures with my Druid, so I'd question that "rarely" part.

Here's the Wizard description now:

    "The Wizard is a seeker of knowledge, and her life is spent focusing on
    this goal.  She users powerful spells to see things from afar and
    transport them between places.  A thirst for arcane knowledge has made
    her a master of magical translocation, as well as an offensive force of
    destruction"
