You know, I'm hardly a SOE basher, I understand that the Test server
population isn't big enough to catch all bugs.  But the last 2 patches
have included bugs that were known about on Test well in advance of the
patch being pushed live.  And for something as major as the graphics
engine and, more importantly, the collision detection engine, they needed
to have more patience.  There is nothing looming in the next 2 or
3 months that they had to rush to beat, they had plenty of time to squash
the bugs on test.  There are some encounters that are reported as being
literally impossible due to collision detection bugs.  This is not a
"bit of downtime" or small bugs - these are game stoppers for many people.

Previous to Whizbang's post on Graffe's I hadn't even thought about
WoW much.  In the 5 years I've played EQ I took extended breaks to try
AC and DAoC - neither of which captured me.  I tend to be very skeptical
of any claims that the next MMORPG will be "all that and a bag of chips".

However, that post and the open nature of their beta have got me a bit
intrigued.  I will be very curious to see what the end game is going
to be about.  If it appears to have the same sort of fun factor that the
early game *appears* to have now, I will definitely give it a try.  Tauren
Shaman or Human Paladin at a guess - depending on how hunters and druids
come out (I love pets, and shapeshifting sounds like a fun game mechanic)>

I don't for a moment believe it will be all roses - there will be bugs,
balance issues and, yes, nerfs.  But those types of things are just part 
of a dynamic world.  A glitchy, bug laden rollout of a new graphics 
engine is not part of a dynamic world - but shoddy quality control and
poor CS.  They should temporarily revert to the previous live server
code and take all the data they've gleaned in the last 24 hours and get to
work cleaning the engine up on test again.
