I understand what you are saying Jazz, but I also look at it as I cannot
train anything in there, I've tried.  As far as taking exp from people that
can get it, all it would mean is they now have to walk a little further to
get that exp I didn't wipe out the whole zone.  I have also cast Tremor from
the top level when nothing was around and got no messages about damage to
anything below me.  Not sure if it penetrates to lower levels there???  Now
I need to test that, get on top of something on track and drop a AOE on
me...... maybe tonight.....
