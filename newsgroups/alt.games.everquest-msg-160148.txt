BlankHi Giias, I can help ya out to where I am upto but I have some
questions myself.  Create a Human Monk non agnostic and hand in your letter
to get your tunic and faction.  This will be enough to do the sash/headband
quests which you can read up on www.monkly-business.com.  Since all the
items arent No Drop, after you complete them just hand them over to your
iksar monk.

Now, I have finished the red sash/purple headband but here are my questions:

1.  Do you ask Brother Qwinn for your headband back?

2.  I noticed you need to talk to some NPC in the Erudin Library.  How does
an Iksar go about doing this?  Is wolf form good enough?

Thanks, Danny

Ok, I have an iksar monk who is ready to start her Epic quest. But she is
KOS everywhere it seems that she must go! How do you other iksars manage to
get your Epic? Any/all help and advice is most appreciated.
