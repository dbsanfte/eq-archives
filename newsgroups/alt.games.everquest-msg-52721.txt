DAMMIT!  I hate responses like this!  It runs against my 'curiosity' trigger
which sets off my 'WTF' stored process.
Then I Have to go back and see what i missed.  Where did OP proclaim any
dislike for country music singers?  Then I see it:  not including 'strait'
people!  LOL!  Okay now it makes sense.  Now I can go back to lurking...
