you get tagged the guildleader, and if you want, you cant just not invite
anyone and have a one person guild

no one is automatically tagged (in the old days, a GM would form your guild
on the spot [or could, at least] and would tag everyone you pointed to)

the GM, when he tages you as leader, will confirm the spelling of your name
(or at least, he/she should)

and the restrictions are 90% of the time up to the taste of the GM (but yes,
no obviously illegal names)

you have to send an email to sony, have the 10 people #guildapprove in the
chat channel ...and you have to wait for a confirmation email (or be ballsy
and lie and say you have it =P )
