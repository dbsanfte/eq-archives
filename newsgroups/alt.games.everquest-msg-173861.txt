There is a lot of truth in that statement. 

Once you hit 50+ you usually are forced to make a choice....Put in the
time and effort it takes to grind your way higher in order to keep up
with friends and guildmates that decide to do the same, or level once
every month or two instead of once a week or every couple of days. If
you are lucky enough to be a strong soloing class or have a solid
group of friends or guildmates advancing at a casual players pace
things aren't so bad.

The biggest changes after level 50 are the need for organized and
efficient grouping/raiding to advance. Most players/guilds just aren't
organized enough to get a group/raid up and running in anything less
than 1-2 hours. For the casual player this can eat up all of their
time on any given night. Raiding takes a LOT of time and commitment.
Generally more than a casual player has.

There are really 2 games in EQ. The 1-50 game and the 51-65 game. Each
player has to decide for themselves which is right for them.
