More than that at low level you can't run AT ALL. In playing DAOC
before release the one thing that really turned me off on the game was
that I could NEVER run from combat even at full sta. The creatures
were ALWAYS faster. In EQ you have a pretty good chance to make it to
the guards unless an sow'd orc is chasing you or something. It was
like all the lil ants and junk all had sow in DAOC. I could actually
have the guards in my sight and had no chance of making it even after
hitting sprint.
