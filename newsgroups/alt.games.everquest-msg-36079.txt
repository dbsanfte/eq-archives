Ok, no biggie here.  Shit happens and it appears that he realized the
mistake since he said he was sorry.

While I would not say you were being a prick up to this point , I would
agree that you were being a bit rude, especially if this was the first
incident. In essence, he most likely percieved you as getting all pissy over
nothing.

So that makes it cool for you to start being a prick about it, when he
clearly wasn't intentionally trying to KS? Some people make honest mistakes.
Getting your panties in a bind over such an insignificant situation, even
though you've been appologized to, is pretty damn stupid.

Whipped out the ol' /ignore, eh?  Boy, you suuuuuure showed him. I'm certain
the poor bastard can't sleep at night.


> When will the idiots STOP!?

I'd say half of them will stop when they realize that maybe it's THEM that
are being the idiots, instead of every other person in the world.  If this
silly little incident gets you riled up, lord help you when you get up in
high levels.
