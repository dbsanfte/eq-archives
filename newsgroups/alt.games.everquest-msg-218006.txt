Sort of agree...

i am also involved in the society for creative anachronism. about 2 
years ago, my husband and i got invited over to the home of another man 
in his work division in the US navy. One of the most stultifyingly 
boring evenings i ever spent. the tv was on the entire time, iirc 
Friends, Seinfeld and somehing i can't even remember played. The dinner 
conversation revolvd around the soup nazi, and some fat woman with 
crappy taste in clothing and makeup. We tried to blend in and talk about 
shows that we had never seen before, we tried to talk about how the 
local casino was affecting the area, we ended up discussing the weather.

In a similar dinner situation with a friend of ours in the SCA, we 
talked about how the weather we have seen earlier in this century was 
similar to the mini ice age caused the migration of the norse down into 
europe and the british isles, and that it was getting too warm locally 
to be comfortable in meieval clothing designed to be worn in a mini-ice 
age because we were in a warming phase, if our friend wanted to try Sol 
Ro server or if we should move to his server, and how the job reductions 
at Electric Boat/General Dynamics were like the generalized closing of 
the textile mills local to connecticut in the 5os and 60s.

Hm, spend a few hours bored off our butts discussing something as dumb 
as the problems totally fictinal people are having...or discuss history, 
current events and a mutual game.
