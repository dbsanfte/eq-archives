One thing to keep in mind with ram, is that if you are running any Win9x
based OS, you may have trouble if you run over 512 MB's of ram. If you run
very much over 512 you'll definitely have trouble, especially with an AGP
videocard, and especially  in games. Everquest usually exhibits problems by
dropping graphics textures after zoning a few times if you are running much
more than 512 with a Geforce3, for example.

Of course, by the time Luclin comes out WinXP will be here, and it (like
Win2000) is capable of running more than 512 mb's. I'm not sure exactly how
much XP can handle, but I'd have to guess that it's well over a gig.

For a technical description of the problems here's a link:

And yes, from what I've seen (especially in XP) having gobs of ram does help
with re-zoning, and a DSL connection doesn't hurt either.
