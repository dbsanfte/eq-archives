Well, you got it three-quarters right anyway.  The fourth class that
has the Lull line isn't overpowered in anybody's eyes.  Well, ok,
hughes hasn't pronounced judgement on Paladins yet, so it's possible
that he thinks they're over-powered.  Of course, Paladin doesn't get
the top of the line Lulls, so we can't Lull any mob higher than L55,
which probably makes the line nearly useless at your level anyway.

Having waxed indignant for weeks about those damned hammers back
when they came out, I just don't have any interest in complaining
about them anymore.  It does amuse me that they make a mockery out
of some of the high-end Cleric loot.
