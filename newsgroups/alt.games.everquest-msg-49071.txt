	They can deny you the ability to play meaningfully, since the PvE game is
vapid.

	As for the "damn tough guards"...they'll be bypassed in short order with
less than half the forces the designers intended.  Maybe less than a quarter.
The players are always smarter than the software.

	To the average PK, his victims are nameless and faceless; no more
important to him than any random target in a FPS.
