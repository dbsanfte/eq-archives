I think she's under the tunnels, and whenever she shows up in W FP, its because
someone lured her out.

I created a Half-Elf Paladin, and she showed up and killed the Paladin right at
the gate about six times before someone took her out!

(I deleted the Paladin, but not because of that; didn't like the character)
