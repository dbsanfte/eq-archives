Sorry, I just recently achieved 200 WIS so I'm looking for resist gear now.
I've been told to look mainly for magic resist ... and possibly some heat
and cold.  Been so focused on WIS gear hunting/questing, that it is a bit
hard to shift gears and also I know I'll need to boost up my WIS on other
gear items to get resists on other gear items that will probably lack or
have less WIS that what is in that slot right now.  Just not sure how to do
this juggling act.  Working hard to get to 47th level so I can go to Hate
(and have a level to spare for when I get repeatedly killed) to get Ethereal
Mist armor and was told Tower of Frozen Shadows was a good place to get XP
and good resist gear.  But not sure what I should be hunting for there and
such.  Very confused over this.  Feel like such a newbie.  =P
