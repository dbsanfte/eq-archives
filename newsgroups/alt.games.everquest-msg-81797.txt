	Long time ago, not too long after Trueshot entered the game.  Trueshot
went through a lot of changes; it initially did next to nothing, then it
provided some increase but did reduced damage to PCs as though it were a spell
under PvP rules.  When they fixed that it started doing some really awesome
damage, but it was calculated in a way that made the damage rating of your bow
irrelevant.  It was during this period that Trueshot earned its rep; for about
a month people on raids were actually heard to say things like "wait, we don't
have enough Rangers!"

	That couldn't be allowed, of course, so Trueshot was "fixed" to properly
take into account the damage rating of the bow.  The result, which is the
current case, is that Trueshot is to Archery as STR is to your melee weapons:
it can increase your max hit (dramatically in some cases), but does nothing
for your minimum hit and little for your average.  If you have a big bow you
can land a shot for 2000 points; you can also hit for 1.  There's no
consistency.  A Warder using Trueshot and a Primal may outdamage a Wizard or
completely whiff.

	From what I've heard, maxed Archery Mastery changes the picture
dramatically.
