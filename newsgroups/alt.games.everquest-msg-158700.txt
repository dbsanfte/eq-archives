step 1: get the hell away from shar vahl.  it's the #1 reason i don't
start a kitty (although with PoK and the new druid ports i might).
i'd suggest WC.
step 2: get a bind.
step 3: get a magic weapon.  if you can find someone who will
sell/give you a velium weapon that procs at lvl 1, that would be great
;)
step 4: kill willowisps til your face is as light blue as they con to
you.  sell the lightstones to merchants, take the greater lightstones
to NK and give them to the NPC in the gypsy camp that gives the
concordance of research quest.  sell the concordance for about 9pp
each.  my enchanter had 250pp pretty quickly using that method.  and
for the love of Tunare, destroy the burned out lightstones (unless
there happens to be a caster around doing research stuff with 'em, in
which case you should trade them looting rights to your BOLs for
buffs!).  nothing worse than seeing a ton of willowisp corpses around
with burned out lightstones on 'em.

also keep an eye out for people who want errands ran: most of my
characters have received a healthy donation (100pp or more) from doing
simple things like equipment transfers, or leading someone to a
merchant or through a zone they were unfamiliar with.

and keep in mind: you're a newbie.  you're SUPPOSED to be flat broke
all the time!

whatever you do, don't become one of those annoying beggars; and if
you don't get a response when asking for something, don't ask again.
