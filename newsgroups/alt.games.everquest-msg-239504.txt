Of course bards suck. We don't have AE stuns, we can't rez, we can't
tank, all other melee classes outdamage us, we don't get dire charm,
we miss notes all the time, we can't feign death, we can't teleport,
our mez lasts only 18 seconds.

See, bards are completely underpowered and useless and need some major
buffing up.

I think I've seen all these complaints on some EQ forum or another. If
I made some up on my own, well, that just proves how underpowered we
bards are!
