just another point... UN did give support for military action... 10
years ago... they just never backed up what they said....

Sorta like the parent that keeps say.. "you do that again and Im gunna
give you a whoopin".... and keeps saying , and saying and saying...

I guess it was just the way I was raised... My dads word ment what he
said.

You do that again, you gnna get a whoopin... and by god... He did it.

Integrity... Honesty... Truth...   thats all were asking for... and by
god.. the UN is not giving that....
