I advise against it. It may look good but the weight is prohibitive. Monks lose
a major ac bonus if their weight goes above 14 (though IIRC this goes up after
lvl 15). Stick to H2H for now and work on ways of keeping your weight down.
Cured silk is a good start, cooked food and weight reducing bags also help. If
you need a good light container cheaply then I recommend buying a medicine bag,
6 slot .6 weight. HTH. :)
