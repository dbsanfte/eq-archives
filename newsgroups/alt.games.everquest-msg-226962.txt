Just the sort of thing I'm talking about, a DKP modified random system, 
so there's always a chance for anyone to win something, but people 
who've put in time without getting loot are favored, and people who come 
do raids where they know there's nothing they need dropping will still 
be rewarded by better odds in future raids.

I particularly like being able to expend points on target selection, 
thats a nice touch I haven't heard of before.

Splendid
