monks, mages, necros.

(Of course, this is only assuming that the monk in question is "old
school" and actually fights primarily hand to hand and has that skill
maxed. You run into more and more twink monks these days who start out
life in full black panther armor and fighting batons or other monkey
sticks and have never duked it out with a mob bare handed. For a CR,
they're pretty much as screwed as anyone else in a firefight.)
