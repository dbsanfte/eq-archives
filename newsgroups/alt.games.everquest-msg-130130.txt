Bah Sand Giants in Oasis. You want good money go for Ice Giants in
Everfrost.  Most the time they are readily available and Everfrost is in a
newbie zone, so there would be nothing else to worry about.  The Ice Giants,
however have an incredible amount of hitpoints and would be extreamly hard
to kill in the 30s (this is speaking on a warriors pov).  I am currently
there killing them with a 51 necro.  Usually make 500-800plat per day per
camp. I'll probobly go through 2 levels by the time I leave there.
