I must agree with John here: Excellent post, so since I can't really
disagree on you there, but still follow different tactics, I will just post
my normal group behaviour....

I must say in advance, that I am only a level 40, and this is my highest
char,
so I am not talking about mobs above level 45, highest I have fought so
far was cyclopses in OOT, I think....

I almost NEVER debuff.... Thing is - if you have to debuff as a puller,
then it's near to deathly, as the mob will come after you unsnared.
I can see the use of debuffs in groups though, and thats where I use
them at times.

But most mobs I have fought so far didnt have enough magic resistance
 for me to bother memming it.

Now there is 3 things that gravely influence my group behaviour:
1) number of people in group
2) classes I am grouped with
3) outdoor or indoor area

On 1, in a full group I am most likely to restrict to snare,
if necessary, and one dot, maybe fear, if 3) is outdoor
Apart from that, I do all I can to stay above 60 mana,
but below 80: If I get above 80, I start twitching
the healer or maybe some other caster who needs it.
If I get below 60, I do a med break, if possible,
not inmidst fight, of course.
This way, if group gets an add, I will just tell them that
I'll take care of the add and solo it. Worked well for 8 levels
or so in the Overthere.
In a smaller group, I will do excessive dotting, and either fear
or root the mob, to keep it offa me.
If I get into trouble, I will either harmshield, taking the aggro
offa me in the selfsame second, or I will run around the group
in circles, and its the casters job to either heal me or get the
 mob offa me.

On 2), if I am grouped with tanks, and there is no real healer
around, I will fear most times, to save the tanks from losing to
 much heals. If I am grouped with another necro, one usually
pulls with snare, the other fears, and then on we go.
If one gets resisted on something, the order switches.
Add a rogue to that, and we can pull blues nonstop, no
downtime at all...
When partnered with a wizzie, we will pingpong the aggro
between us.

On 3), first thing I do when entering a dungeon, is cancel
fear and memorize root instead.
Then I will usually try not to get the aggro inside, as running around
like a headless chicken is usually no option there.
Then I will mem Screaming Terror, as after not using it for like
10 levels, I have found that it can be quite useful now that it
doesn't really get resisted seriously anymore...
Then I will mostly pull mobs with snare nonetheless, to keep
them from running too far when dying. I will also TRY to root
them near the end of the fight, or just save a nuke for the instant
when they start running. Lifetap mostly.
I of course never have a pet tagging along, if I need my pet,
I will just pull it in the destination, and /pet taunt off, of course...

--- OT ----
I have even found a use for the point blank AoE nuke series
we necros get: Only once, but it saved my life: I was in Upper Guk,
Scrier room, with a wizzie friend...
We cleared the room, but then one of the guards escaped us downstairs,
to my nuke it was out of sight. My pet was beating on it, but not fast
enough.
Now, only having 40mana to start with, I got a train of maybe TEN
frogloks at once, in the room down that ramp.
They were whacking at me and pet, and I was kinda desperate.
So I ran a little back, managed to even sit down and memorize
Word of Spirit, ran into their midst, and nuked like 5 to 7 frogs
at once, for 110 damage each, or so.... Best damage/mana ratio
I _ever_ had :)
They stupidly started running at that, and I thought now its over,
they will just multiply the train size by ten again, but they didnt...
The room was empty :) No more friends around to help...
My pet was whaking one after another, and the rest where now
whacking me. My wizzie friend had joined me down there when
I had told him "Uh oh, think I got a lil problem here", and I was
seriously getting low on health. I tried to lifetap the beasts,
but they kept running towards me, whacking me, and running out
of sight before I could get a leach through...
Somehow, when I didn't notice, a leach eventually came through
 though, and I finally noticed when it brought me back from
unconsciousness rather quick. That was when wizzie and pet had
decimated the frogs enough so I didn't get further aggro and we
quickly killed the rest.

You can believe me that, after this particular experience, I keep
a CLOSE watch on running critters...
