We used to duo for xp in the corner of the zone by the dragon statue
that's just to your left as you come out of the OT tunnel.

There are numerous wanderer paths there, but there is only one that
comes down the wall and turns the corner heading towards BW. It can be
any sort of mob, but if it's a chromo looking type, check it. It's often
Eldrig. I believe he spawns past the OT tunnel going towards rage camp,
crosses in front of OT and follows the wall. We used to see him at least
every other playing session, and usually every time if there for a
couple hours.

Not that he can't spawn in other spots too, I guess, or else he wanders
a long way. I've seen him up outside BW in the past. But that's a good
place to get a jump on him.
