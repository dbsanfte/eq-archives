Yeah, i remember when i fell through the world (thankfully, i had safe fall
and survived) and watched these burynai rain down... it was funny seeing the
little dungeons from beneath and walking beneath the ocean. Pretty scary,
too as I was afraid of my character being wiped if i logged out or died.
Despite petitioning for help, i never got any, and eventually found out i
could sort of leap out into the bottom of the sea.

Unfortunately i then wandered into a cave and was swarmed by rebel iksars,
but that's another story...
