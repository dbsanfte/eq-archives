Sorry, but, now i'm 12, and I died only 2 times (and each that's a guard
killed me because of AE DoT spell casted on mob and guard come fighting it).
For me Wizard are very powerfull and easy to level if you can have SOW.
Killing mob at low level is rly easier than with shamman.
Of course SHM are more resistant but so bad in weapon skill at start and not
rly powerfull in spells. I don't like shamman. I prefer Wizzzzzard :-)
Farther, I don't know if wizards contine to hurt mobs for so numerous heal
points, but, if yes, i think wizard will kill a lot of mobs in a groupe :-)
Danger will be to control well aggro, isn't it ?
