I ran into a similar problem, except I'm not guild leader, so I had
no way to flag myself as a banker.  Thus, once I clicked "deposit",
I wasn't allowed to click "put in bank", but I also couldn't click
"withdraw".  The item I'd depositedwas completely inaccessible to me.
Given that I was trying it out with one of my rings, I was upset.

I *did* try to RTFM before doing this.  I clicked on the ? in the
guild bank window, and read it all, and it didn't explain what a
"banker" was, so I thought maybe it was the person who put any given
item in the bank.  I.e., if I put my ring in, I'd be the banker for
that ring, and the default permission would be that only I could take
it out again.  Seemed a bit odd, since it would be giving extra bank
space to all guild members, but I was willing to try it.  Oops!

When I asked about it in-game, some people told me there were files
in my EverQuest folder with more documentation.  But I did also look
in my /help folder, and didn't see anything about the guild bank and
how people need to be designated as bankers.  The /help/tips folder
has the files used for the Tip windows, and /help itself seems to have
the mostly out of date stuff from the general Help window.  Is there
something more?
