    That seems fast. The best AA XP I ever saw in Acrylia was an AA per 90
minutes or so. That was two enchanters, one cleric, two wizards, and a
warrior puller with Rampage and Earthshaker.

    SRT, that sounds about right. But your XP is that slow in Earth? My
groups, since the grouping bonus change, have been pulling in consistent 50
minute AA points. The group is usually cleric (me), warrior, shaman,
necromancer, and any two DPS types that happen to be around (wizard, mage,
ranger, monk most common).

    The longer it takes to kill stuff, the more likely it is resists will
kill your group. One wizard and a ton of mobs is not a good idea. I speak
from the experience of doing three man AoE (wizard, cleric, enchanter) in
Fungus Grove - if I, the cleric, didn't chip in damage we were in trouble.

    Heh. Four clerics trying to kill mobs with one cast each of Unspoken
Word and a few casts each of Upheaval would be comical. Upheaval is a real
mana hog, with a stupid refresh time.
