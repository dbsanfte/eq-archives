Well, alas, you might have had some points of discussion, but I have little
interest in debating them with you.

I have some people who strongly disagree with my views about CR's.  A rogue
in my guild and I got into a lively debate regarding whether CR's should be
easy or difficult.  It was interesting, and I think we both enjoyed it.  I
understood his point even as I disagreed with it.

I might have enjoyed a similar discussion with you, except your tone makes
it clear you're not interested in discussion, only in disparaging the
opinions of others when they disagree with your own.  So I won't respond
further, unless you truly are interested in debate and not in trading
insults.  Your debate style may be predicated on insulting your opponent and
expecting the same in return while exchanging counterpoints, and that's fine
I suppose.  But it's not a debate style I respond to.
