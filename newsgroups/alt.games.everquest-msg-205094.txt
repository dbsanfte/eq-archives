I asked about this in the eqcleric forums, since the recommendation
for CA came from there.

The short answer was that nobody knows for sure, but it's not a simple
% adjustment to the chance at a miss. (Otherwise a 95% miss rate would
become a 104.5% miss rate.)

One person who had parsed their logs when they upgraded from no CA to CA1
found a 7% drop in damage taken. Which is much better than the description
would suggest. On the other hand, this sort of testing tends to get done
via green MOBs, and AC adjustments tend to affect green MOBs
disproportionately.

There are guesses that it's actually an adjustment to avoidance AC, so
the 10% adjustment would vary in effect depending on the MOB. That seems
to more or less fit the available evidence.

Given that for one person, CA1 (2% adjustment?) gave a 7% drop in damage
taken, that's the course I would choose to take. Yes, it's true that the
increase in HP is certain. On the other hand that certainty has to deal
with uncertainties... like MOBs that double for 500s. Basically whatever
you do you're subject to the vagaries of the random number generator, and
whatever I can do to tilt the odds in my favour can only be a good thing.

All this is hearsay for me at present, since I'm still filling out my
"essential" AAs, so feel free to take this with a grain of salt.
