<snip hypothetical situation>

Those types of auctions annoy me too, (especially if they're in the global
channel).

That said, I bought my ES arms off a guy "selling all on him" and was very
happy for 3 levels (Until I got my thurg bracer, heh, 1/2 sec less casting
time too)

With your situation of "how much", "make offer" etc; a lot of times I do
that with someone because either A) I don't know how much the item goes for,
or B) I want to try and get a rediculous amount of money for it (EG, selling
armor gems, where they normally go for 300 ea. and I get an offer of 1k for
2), basically, at least on my part, it's a way to filter the
morons/desperate people out, who both usually pay more for something.

Then again, it's also funny to have a warrior friend hold your jade reaver
in their hands and stand right in front of someone who you know wants one.
(the warrior was 5 ft away from me IRL, so I could smack him if he tried to
steal it, and the guy who wanted one was a mutual friend that we were just
playing a practical joke on)

Yeah, I know that last anecdote probably made no causal sense, but my head
is being strange thinking right now.
