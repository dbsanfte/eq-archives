I recently hit 51 with my Druid and I am looking for a place that I can
solo, I have all the expansions. I have been in EW since since 39, So I am
of need for a new zone bad.  Also I recently got my Seb key and was
wondering if I was still too low to go there if I wanted to group.


Thanks in advace
