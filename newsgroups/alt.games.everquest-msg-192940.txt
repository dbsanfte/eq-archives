Yes it does need to be sharpened.  You need to get a sharpening stone
and combine the sword and stone in a forge.  You can buy the stone in
Halas near the smith shop.  (There is a vendor outside, behind a
building against a wall, hidden from view unless you look behind the
buildings.)  Note that there is a similar quest for the druid sword. 
Make sure that the one you have is useable by rangers before you go
any further.

If you have not worked on smithing, you may fail.  I believe you will
simply get back the rusty sword if you do fail, so you can keep buying
sharpening stones until you succeed.  However if you feel
unconfortable trying with poor smithing skill, then start collecting
the rusty weapons you loot from dead skeletons and whatnot.  Buy
sharpening stones and attempt to sharpen them all until you get the
message 'You can no longer improve your skills by making this item'
(or something like that).  At this point, your chances of failing in
sharpening any sword with a sharpening stone is greatly reduced. 
(Something like a 5% chance of fail.)

Once you do succeed, go get a gnoll fang and a large snake skin. 
Gnoll fangs drop in blackborow.  There are giant snakes in Blackborrow
that *may* drop the skins.  If they don't, try looking around Qeynos
hills for large king snakes.  They may be called "King Snakes", "Giant
King Snakes", "Large King Snakes", "Giant Snakes", "Large Snakes" ,...
 It's always tough to tell by the things NPC's tell you.  Verant was
often inaccurate in the text of the NPC quest messages.  Once you have
both the gnoll fang and the large snake skin, turn all three
(sharpened sword, skin, fang) in to the guy who gave you the rusty
sword and you will get an upgrade.
