A tongue in cheek response to John Smedley's Letter to the Community: 
April 8, 2005
 
> Hello Everyone,

Hello John,

Then almost half your playerbase declined? Good for them!

Yup, until now, the players thought their monthly subscriptions were 
supposed to be covering some sort of ongoing content development. If 
they wanted to play a static online game there are several free ones out 
there. So what exactly are you doing with all the subscription money 
now?

Strong demand and sever consolidation in the same paragraph. I can't be 
the only one that sees some incongruity in claiming a game that appears 
to have hemorrhaged 50+% of its playerbase in 3 months to be in strong 
demand...

Start saving now for the lawsuit; dear Firiona probably isn't going to 
be quite as impressed. (Assuming her parents remember to feed her during 
their downtime.)

Telephone hold times are now 5 minutes or under because you've 
demonstrated that there is no reason to call. You don't provide customer 
service anyways, so whats the point?

> And our in-game response 
> times are among the best in the business!  We know how important this is to 
> our players, 

Good, thought out, personalized customer service is important to your 
players. Getting told to "stuff it" isn't high on our priority list; no 
matter how quickly you do it.

> and we will continue to focus on decreasing these response 
> times even further.

Why not just cancel your phone lines and remove the /petition command? 
You could then brag how proud you are that your customer complaints and 
your hold times have dropped to zero.

"Unless you have an issue. Then we're not really here at all. Please ask 
someone else, somewhere else, and assume its your own fault! 

PS Even it is our fault we won't...er can't, yeah that's it: "can't" do 
anything to fix it anyways."
