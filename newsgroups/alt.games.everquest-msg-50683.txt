EQ is a roleplaying game by definition so a newsgroup specifically
about that is as moot as labeling a server "roleplaying" when its the
same as every other one (I'm about level 13 on it now and see no
difference except I can't understand many people saying "plz" but can
tell they are)

People need to get out of the mind set that "roleplay" is something
different or hard that you do, its just playing your character like
its a barbarian shamaness instead of like its Susan living in her
parents basement in the midwest having a "just what the hell am I
doing with my life now" crisis and listening to CDS while playing.

Its actually easier to roleplay in game than to purposefully not
roleplay for me.
