Icy Orcs in Everfrost are often camped.  

You can also try to solo blue mammoth.  I recall at some point in my
30's soloing the occassional blue mammoth, then killing a few calfs
while I healed up.  Turning in the calf hides was still pretty decent
experience & helped restore the rogue faction I had lost from doing
the langseax quest several times.
