Hm, I know I have to be out of ag range to single, if i am 
standing next to a mob and nuking one across the little room, the 
one next to me will take umbrage and whack me also...and if I get 
too close to Yvolcarn while nuking a wyvern he gets really miffed 
at me and i just hit the skyshrine zone to dump agro.

Was making great plat selling the hides, cod oil and velium 
smithed goodies as a package deal, plus not a lot of really good 
moneymaking solo spots for clerics that give even minimal xp on 
top. Being able to crank out 3 or 4K pp per KEI is nice when it 
also gets me 10 or 15% of an aa point on top.

I love trying different race and class combos on test, is great 
for seeing how things work and give me an understanding of other 
classes. I am looking foreward to EQ2 going live - have one on 
preorder. I am interested in the crafting aspect - something 
other than the combine, autodrop does take my fancy, especially 
if we can crank out stuff that actually sells=)
