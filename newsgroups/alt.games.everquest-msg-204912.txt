If what you want to do is figure out what weapon will give you the 
highest DPS, then it will give you a marginal starting point for that.  
With the damage bonus that you get for mainhand weapons though, level 
figures extremely heavily into what your DPS will actually be for your 
mainhand, or for a two hander.  For your off hand, assuming the same 
attack rating for the weapons you are comparing, that is an excellent way 
to compare weapons.  For your main hand, or for a two hander, low delay 
is extremely important as you level, it takes a truly godly ratio to 
overcome a low delay on a weapon.

Comparing a 25/40 weapon to a 9/19 weapon, the 25/40 looks better on the 
surface, but, the 9/19 is higher DPS in your main hand if you are high 
enough level.  It is quite possible for a 1/10 weapon to be better than a 
seemingly much better 20/40 weapon. Let's say you have a damage bonus of 
15.

The 1/10 becomes ((1*2)+1+15)/(10/10)=18.
The 20/40 becomes ((20*2)+1+15)/(40/10)=14.

For off hand though:
((1*2)+1)/(10/10)=0.3
((20*2)+1)/(40/10)=10.25

The point at which the 1/10 becomes better is around a damage bonus of 10 
in this case:

Damage bonus 10
((1*2)+1+10)/(10/10)=13
((20*2)+1+10)/(40/10)=12.75

Damage bonus 9
((1*2)+1+9)/(10/10)=12
((20*2)+1+9)/(40/10)=12.5

If you attack rating is identical with two different weapons, then adding 
in the damage bonus should give you a reasonable comparison for which 
weapon is better.  It will not tell you what the actual DPS will be, as 
there are far too many other factors involved.
