I think theres a potion vendor in bazaar (not sure), but you can definitly
find them on the vendor by the Kelethin bank. Going to be expensive soloing
tho. If i were a 49 wiz id go quad raptors in TD, or quad hornets/undead in
BW, or wyverns in CS.
You can get Eb items in bazaar for a few k these days too.
