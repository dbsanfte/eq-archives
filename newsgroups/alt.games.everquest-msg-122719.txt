Back ages ago I had a guy auctioning in WFP some 2H sword I had never
heard of (was still young so that doesnt mean much LOL) with damned
good stats and only 200pp.  So I go meet him to check it out and he
asks to see the money as he is tired of getting jerked around by
newbies who dont have the cash.

I put up the 200pp and he puts up the sword and clicks trade.  Well, I
didn't=)  I right clicked it.  "Rusty 2H Sword".   I cancelled and
said "Dude, that's a Rusy 2Handed Sword."  He said, " OH, my mistake.
Sorry." and walked away.  I did an OOC to let everyone know=)
