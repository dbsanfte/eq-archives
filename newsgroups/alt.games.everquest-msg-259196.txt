Everyone is telling me that run3 is the AA that I should go for first, but
I'm not so sure.  I have a small drum (and, being a caster, I'm on my mount
constantly) which would make me go the speed of the mount, thereby making
run3 useless.  I can see how it would be good for running from mobs, but
even on my little drogmor I'm still like 25% faster than most mobs, and i've
got harmshield, fiegn death, and root to keep mobs off me, not to mention
the self only evacuate I get at level 55, so I'm usually ok when it comes to
escaping.  So I don't think it would really make that much of a difference
for me.  Would it be better to put my AA points toword something else?
