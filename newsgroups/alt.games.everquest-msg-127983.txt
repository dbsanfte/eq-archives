What is even more frustrating about the EK hill giant spawn is that this bug
in their spawn pattern has been around for quite some time. I have /bug
reported it at least 5 times. On a related note though, if you petition Mobs
stuck under the world - a GM will come and correct the problem - at least
temporarily until the spawn occurs again that way. I hunted the giants there
quite frequently in my earlier Druid days.
