You don't say, but I'm assuming from the tone of your post that
you play solo.  EQ was designed as a grouping game.  Gear that
is appropriate for a given level (mostly) requires a group of
that level to obtain.  Note that if you _can_ get it solo then
it is accessible to lower levels because they can group to kill
anything you can kill.  Oh, and the Garou Bone Club I mentioned
in my other post (a 1hb with +7 WIS) is an easily soloable quest
for a L39 Druid, you just need to get lucky and find Garou up
(Midnight, the other mob you have to kill, is not so uncommon).
You simply are _not_ likely to get much interesting loot solo
unless you quest for it, the only exception I can think of off
the top of my head is the Elysian armor (NODROP Druid-only) which
is apparently a sop thrown out there for solo Druids in their 50s.
