If you want to travel the world and see every city create an Enchanter, with
there illusions spells they can go anywhere.  But as far as an Iskar your
hated everywhere, I would stay in Kunark until at least 30 then venture out,
by then you will have FD and will probably want to kill the patrons of the
citys not make friends with them.  Remember your Evil, play the part. Kill
the soft skins when ever you get a chance.
