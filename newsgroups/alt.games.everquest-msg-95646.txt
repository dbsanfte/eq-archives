    My experience at lower levels has been pretty consistent: as soon as
your pet is lower level than what you're fighting, it gets wasted and has
trouble hitting. If it's higher level than the target, it deals damage the
way you'd expect it to deal damage.

    Cool. Back up and let it hit *the pet*. You know, the pet that can't get
aggro otherwise? :-)

    Yes, and he's ignoring how you can work root aggro throughout the length
of the fight. A rooted mob always attacks the closest target, always,
without fail. IF the pet is landing root enough that you feel you're taking
extra damage from it, then work it to your advantage to make sure the mob
only hits the PC that is best suited to take damage. That can save healing
mana. Then, like I said, if the mob is low enough on life that it would
normally flee back up a ways and let the pet take a few shots. I've been in
groups with my melee and an earth pet, and with my cleric and an earth pet.
The only times the earth pet was a pain was when root and snare didn't
stack, and when the melees didn't understand how to position to handle root
aggro.
