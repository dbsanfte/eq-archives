I'm just wondering how many people have done this:

There's a quest in PoK that you get from the Barbarian fishing vendor. You
go to the Plane of Nightmare and the Plane of Valor, bring back 2 Nightmare
Cichlid and 2 Valor Discus, then use your tacklebox to turn them into
prepared fish and fishbones (meaning you have to be a Fishing Grandmaster,
or close to it, since this trivials in the high 180's), and give the
Barbarian the 4 fish bones. He then gives you an item with a right-click
effect that summons a fishing pole with +3 to Fishing. The summoned fishing
pole can also summon ale.

This seriously ticks me off, because there was originally supposed to be a
lvl 20 Magician spell called Summon Brell's Fishin' Pole (which is the name
of the effect on the quested item) that I was looking forward because I fish
a lot, but it never made it off the test server. As a lvl 31 Magician with a
Fishing skill around 70, its going to be impossible for me to get this item
for a while.

If there's a lvl 46 or higher Grandmaster Fisherman (or Fisherwoman) on The
Rathe server with PoP who reads this  and would be willing to give me any
extra fish bones you have for this quest, I'd be extremely greatful.

(The spell isn't listed in the PoP strategy guide, which I looked through
but didn't buy, and it isn't sold in the PoK library, so it definitely
doesn't exist, unless its a dropped spell)


Zyrtryx Conjureblade - lvl 31 High Elf Magician (Master Baker - 138 skill,
so-so Potter - 62 skill)
Oakenthorn - lvl 13 Halfling Ranger (No tradeskills atm)
Wyldeklaw - lvl 7 Vah Shir Shaman (just getting started on Tailoring;
haven't trivialled combining silks yet)
The Rathe server
