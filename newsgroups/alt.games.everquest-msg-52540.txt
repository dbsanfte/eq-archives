Hello-

I have a small problem maybe someone can help me with?
On patch day
I logged in and everything was normal
and logged out.

Later in the evening I logged in after downloading all
patches(velious/kunark/optional)
and I locked up before gettin all the way live.
So I reset computer, scan disk and Then logged in fine....
Scan disk didnt find a problem.
Once I went live My screen was Very Dark.
All my video settings(in game) where changed.....
All my hot keys Are gone.
All my customized settings such as Loc and Incoming are gone(not hot keyed
nor under the social list)?
I havent checked my friends list in game but have checked it in EQ directory
and it seems to be fine for my 2 characters.

Why is this and what went wrong?
Could a file be missing or moved? (If so what file)

I am not very technical with computers but not Blind.

Thank you all for any insight you may be able to provide me...

Thanks

    -Kris.
