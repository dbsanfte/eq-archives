I could be entirely wrong, was quoting "recieved wisdom" which said: clerics
heal, druids RGC.  I've never, ever, seen one single curse in all my time
playing this game.  I've seen copies of RC in the bazaar for 3Kpp or more, every
now and then I think about buying one just in case, but thats still "real money"
to me, not like going out and buying Cure Blindness for a couple plat.

If you have 6+ clerics but only need two... then you only need 2, not 6+.

Further, while you may need 6+ clerics for the main battle, how many druids do
you need?  Was that the sound of one hand clapping I heard?  Druids are rarely
"needed" for a battle, by deliberately giving RGC only to them, you give them at
least one area where they are the "go to" class.  This has been my guild's logic
on our whopping two copies of RGC thus far.

We have a third RGC'er, as of a couple days ago, we took a single group in to GE
and killed a mob who was weilding a staff with 20 to all saves and clicky RGC.
The plan was to have one of our druids port in and loot it, but it turned out to
be cleric only, so we rolled and I lost (yes, two clerics in one group... I was
DPS and backup heals)
