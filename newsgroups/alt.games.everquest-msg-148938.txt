Reason #1 when they start: Because they genuinely want to help people. It
feels good to rescue someone stuck in the scenery, or uncover a hidden
corpse, or perform a role-playing ceremony.

Why they continue to do it:
3. It's fun to act in Quests that change the world or amuse a few (except
for the inevitable assholes that fuck that up). Of course, these
opportunities aren't that common.A typical guide can do about one a month.
Maybe two. Sometimes, I'd just get a few stacks of booze and wander around
offering folks a drink. My guide character had her AT maxed.

2. Resetting merchants is fun. Nubs Blackgranite, Slea Pinewhisper... I had
a routine where I would just hit the usual culprits and put them back where
they belonged. Then beg players for heals.

1. Exploring areas I couldn't with my main safely. Having the invulnerable
tag and casually wandering through Chardok or Veeshan's Peek without anyone
attacking me was just plain wonderful. I can't tell you how many raids I
helped plan, just because I could explore the zone and mark down where the
spawn points were. THIS is what I miss about being a guide. Yes some zones
were off limits- like the Planes. But my main didn't get higher than 45ish
while I was guiding- so I got to know a lot of places I thought I'd never
see.

Why they stop:
1. Assholes.

2. The realization that they can only help about 20% of petitions. Another
20% of petitions are pointless (player now offline or issue resolved). The
rest need a GM. I truly got sick of saying, "I'm sorry, but you need to
speak to a GM about this. Our server GM worsk Wed to Sun, 3pm to 10pm PST.
It is now Xam PST. Please petition then." Specially if the next thing I got
from the player was "But that's when I sleep or work." And with the change
to roving GMs, you couldn't guarantee a time for a server GM to be on.

3. The realization that they themselves are starting to act like an asshole.
