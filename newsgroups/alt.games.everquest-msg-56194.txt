I have multiquested 4 of the 5 shadowbound quests successfully: robe,
gloves, boots, and harvester. Don't know about the damn book though; that
mage in lake rathe keeps eating my 52 druid for breakfast everytime I try
to kill him.  Anyone know a good tactic for taking this guy down with a
solo druid? I have all resistances over 100 and he still manages to wipe me
out in no time flat.  Hmmm, maybe I need to take my husband's 52 ranger
over there instead?  Perhaps a melee class would fare better. . .
