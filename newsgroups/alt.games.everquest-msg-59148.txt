You are confusing usenet and mail.  Your SMTP (simple mail transport
protocol) server is your mail server, your NNTP (network news
transport protocol) server is your news server.  Mail is NOT news, no
matter what your IT idiots try to tell you.  It has been a LONG time
since I've used Free Agent, and I know it lacks some of the mail
capabilites of Agent, but if all you're looking to do is read
newsgroups, it's not an issue.
If you get a new newsread, enter the exact same SMTP server you're
using in OE, but you'll really only need it if you respond to a post
and email a copy.  You post using NNTP, **NOT** SMTP.  Any reasonably
recent (like in the past 7 years) mail program will be able to send
mail through a properly configured Exchange server, though most won't
be able to deal with the Exchange specific fluff like calendars that
have nothing to do with email anyway.
If this is still confused, send me an email (remove the spamblock)
with your OE settings and I'll tell you what goes where in Free Agent.

mail != news
