Only 8?  hmmmm, hard to decide whether I want a solo
optimized or group optimized........

1.  Draught of Thunder
2.  Draught of Ro
3.  Draught of E'ci
4.  Forlorn Deeds
5.  Spirit of Sorsha (64 bl pet)
6.  Burnout V (85% pet haste + atk)
7.  Quiescence
8.  canni 4

Solo, low pop or below - slowed mobs,
4300hp tank with quiesence, quick hitting nukes,
fastest non-aa dependent mana regen in the game.
(Can 5 and mage pet-canni require aa's)

Group - Slow, pet dps, nuke (3 resists) dps, HoT

Raid - Good nuke dps (not the best), pet
where they can be used.

Think that's one I'd try :)
