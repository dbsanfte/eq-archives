Im the first 60th enchanter in my guild. But there are several others
approaching the mark as well.
We want to do some raids to get the spell KEI to drop. These are the
monsters I know of that drop KEI
does anyone have any advice on which are the easiest to take down, and tips
for raiding them?

    Our average level is 54, and we are light on clerics, but we have been
able to take down Inny, and a few other major encounters.

Thanks for the advice!
