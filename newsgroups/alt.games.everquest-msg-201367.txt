I have this recurring nightmare that Jordan decides it's a 20-book
series. I've just finished reading "The Cloak of Ennui," the 3,250
page epic 19th novel which culminates in Rand choosing to wear the red
cloak at his wedding to the Princess from the Empire Beyond the Sea.

writing the first book of a new series before he does book 20 and is
subsequently lynched, leaving only the following fragment of the last
novel:

The Dragon Reborn looked up from his bed with rheumy eyes. He tried to
whisper something, but the Aes Sedae could not hear. She handed Rand a

throat, "Rosebud..."
