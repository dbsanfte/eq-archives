So a better test would be to look around for someone selling something cheap
that stacks, say fish rolls, and go buy two.  Did you get two stacks or two
items?  What did you pay?

Lets saythe fish rolls are listed at 1pp.  Buy two, you pay 2pp, and you get
two, not two stacks.  Well, that's almost solved it.  One more step.  Price the
fish rolls at 1 pp.  Check /bazaar and look yourself up.  Fish rolls priced at
2pp or one, or 5 gp?  One pp.  Yet your stack has two in it.

OK, the system prices single unit regardless of how many are in your stack, and
will charge per each when buying or selling.
