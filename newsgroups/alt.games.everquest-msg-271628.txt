A while back I heard that Transgaming's Cedega software supports running 
EQ under linux. As a bit of a linux fan, I've kept tabs on this...after 
all one of the reasons I keep windows on my primary PCs instead of going 
pure Linux & OSX is for the games.

Not surprisingly EQ2, according to reports, doesn't run playably in this 
configuration. What -is- surprising is that WoW *does*, and apparently 
runs quite well.

And, while EQ2 is, by most accounts the graphically superior title, that 
doesn't account for all... many of the years graphics blockbusters are 
also supported... e.g. Doom3, and Half-Life2.

Coupled with Blizzards simultaneous and proper support of the OSX, 
something SOE only did late and half-assed with EQ1, and so far haven't 
even attempted with EQ2... it really makes we wonder just what SOE has 
done with (to?) their code.
