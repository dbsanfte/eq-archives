> What's the best way to move EQ to the new system?

Come to think of it, I just thought of a better way.

(1)  Go hunt down an old 5 1/2 inch floppy drive.  I think my dad has one if
you want it.

(2)  Find yourself some old 5 1/2 inch floppies.  Again, my dad has a
couple.

(3)  Copy your EQ files one at a time onto those good ol' 5 1/2 inchers.
Some of them will be too big to fit, so see (4)

(4)  Call random numbers in the phone book until you find someone who has a
filesplitter program.  Beg them to let you have it.  If they say no, try
another number.  If they say yes, go to their house (bring your new floppy
drive in case they don't have one), use the program to split itself into
pieces that will fit on your 5 1/2 inchers and copy it onto the floppies.
Depending on how many floppies you have, you might have to make a few trips.

(5)  Bring the filesplitter home, copy it onto your hard drive, and rebuild
it.

(6)  Split your EQ files so they'll fit on your floppies and move the pieces
onto your new harddrive.

(7)  Reassemble them.

(8)  Format your harddrive, take your computer back to the person who sold
it to you, and tell them you can't use it because your floppy drive won't
fit in the slots.

(9)  Beat your head repeatedly on the wall.

(10)  Killfile me.
