I've got a low-20s Monk who's never trained up any weapon skill.
I use Ulaks (Polished Steel, I think) and my HTH skill has never
lagged.  If I ever find a good 1HB I'll equip it in my off hand
and let it train up while I kill things with my primary hand and
special attacks.

Speaking of which, does anyone else find it a real pain training
up each new special attack?  I stopped using Kick when I got
Round Kick, and then dropped RK in favor of Tiger Claw.  I wasn't
PL'ing, so I spent a while getting from 10 to 20, when the next
special attack turns up (Eagle Strike).  (There's another attack
skill inbetween, but it's Double Attack, which just boosts my
existing melee attacks instead of replacing anything.)  This gave
me time to max out Tiger Claw at level 19.  But then, at level 20,
Eagle Strike is presumably a much better attack, except my skill
with it SUCKS!  And it seems to be taking FOREVER to train up.

When I'm fighting green mobs, of course, I just use Tiger Claw,
since I can't skill up anyway.  And if I'm fighting a dicey battle
I'll mostly use Tiger Claw because it hits so much more often and
I need the damage.  But even when I'm fighting a solo blue/cyan,
and I'm using Eagle Strike, it rarely goes up.  I've got it all
the way to a whopping skill 41 so far, and a lot of that was
done with training points.

Is there some trick to skilling up a new special attack?  I'm
really dreading getting Dragon Punch and Flying Kick when I hit
levels 25 and 30.
