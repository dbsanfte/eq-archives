I have to admit, I was told by another person that my (supposedly)
'pre-nerf' Centi LS was worth 5k on TP, and innocently auctioned it as 
'pre-nerf'.  Once somebody told me the facts I stopped, but there is a 
lot of bad information going around and you have to consider that the 
person selling isn't trying to scam but simply doesn't know any better. 
  We're not all EC veterans, most people can't stand the zone.
