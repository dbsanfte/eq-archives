OK, try to follow along.

You want an LDoN group.

If you are lucky, a 5 player group gives you a tell, you are the 6th 
man, good to go instantly.

But more often than not, you find one person interested.  Then the two 
of you find another, and another, and now you have to start thinking "do 
we go with just the four of us?".

This process can take quite a while, particularly if your character 
isn't one of the "tank, healer, mezzer" holy trinity many will refuse to 
enter a run without.

BUT if you take that second person and go do a simple exp camp while you 
wait, then the half hour, hour, more that it takes to get to critical 
mass isnt' wasted after all.  If you are exping in POP, you are only a 
couple zones away from an LDoN camp at worst, and you can even bind a 
gate class there and make him leader so you lose no time at all when 
ready to go; he gates and gets mission while the rest of you run 
straight to the destination.

Key to this plan, of course, is finding simple camps near a POK book, it 
doesn't have to be great exp or great loot, the main requirement is that 
it be something you can do with any given partner, and yet is still 
-some- exp/loot to both.
