Mostly Ive found that certain people dont listen. We sat down before
the raid knowing he didnt group much and laid out the "law" as it
were. I guess in the excitement of the battle, he kicked into solo
mode, playing as he always did.

Not trying to tell him what to do. Just offering up some past
experiences from people who didnt group until late in thier careers.
Everyone has the right to play in the way they enjoy most.

Im sure he will do just fine. I wasnt trying to suggest that he would
end up in that situation, was just offering a story of a worst case
situation, perhaps to nudge him into grouping to at least start
experiencing it, for many reasons beyond being "raid smart". The
learning curve really starts at level 30. This is all really a moot
point because as you say, hes at the point where he will have to start
grouping.
