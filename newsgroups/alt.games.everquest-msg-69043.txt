Not in my experience; what I did find was that if you didn't kill the
skeletons that were in and/or quite near the actual ruins, they would
jump up and kill her on her way up the hill. I wondered, through what
must have been 3 or 4 Pyzjn-incoming events, why the skeletons kept
jumping up and running down the hill for no apparent reason; the next
time around, I sat on the rim of the "valley" between the ruin and
Blackburrow, rather than sitting up on the hill looking into the ruin.
Sure enough, they're all running down to kill the thing I've tried so
hard to spawn. I'm fairly sure that the decayed skeletons don't bother
her, but be sure to eliminate the other sorts as they spawn.

The only thing you have to do (caveat, this may have changed, it's
been months since I camped Pyzjn) is to kill the placeholder. And
wait. And hope she has the stinking GBS once you kill her.

IIRC, Pyzjn is only a mid-teens level character. Assuming you have
even mimimal magic resistance, killing her should be the least of your
worries, if you're level 20 or so. Spawning her, yes. Having Holly
Windstalker catch you killing the placeholder, yes. Spawning Varsoon
by accident, oh my, yes....

Always had to deal with the pet afterwards, but if you can kill the
putrid skels and dread corpses, the pet will be a cakewalk.
Concentrate on Pyz, mop up the pet afterward.

If the paladin is running Luclin, he/she should have one or two of the
nice,new low level interrupt spells (heck, buy them from someone if
your partner isn't running Luclin, they're nice), and very likely a
Bash as well. Doubleteamed and interrupted, she shouldn't get off many
spells against you. The only time she was remotely tricky was when she
(apparently) went invisible and I lost track of her until she cast
another spell.
