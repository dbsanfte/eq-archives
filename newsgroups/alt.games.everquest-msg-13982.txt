Not here. The trick is to pick a word or phrase that you can remember,
then mangle it.

For instance, start with a password of "dietcoke". That would be a
pretty decent guess if someone were trying to crack my password, since
I drink 3 liters a day of the junk.

So, mangle it. Change a couple letters per the customs of dewdspeak (E
to 3, I to 1, O to 0), add some punctuation (underscores, in this
case) and toss a numeric string on the end (for obviousness in this
example, 7734 is 'hell' spelled upside down.

d13t_c0k3_7734

And viola, you've got yourself a password that no dictionary attack
will ever crack, that is virtually unguessable, and that is remarkably
easy for the person using it to commit to memory. No paper.

Note - The only problem in this example is the starting point, since
like I said it would be an obvious choice for me. I always pick some
really random phrase, often from a pin-the-tail-on-the-dictionary
trick.
