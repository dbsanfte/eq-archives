Indeed.  Got three crits in a row off a Rain spell (on a single mob) once -
I had to wipe the drool off my keyboard.

And every so often you do get a run where you feel the random number
generator is working _for_ you (for a change!) - e.g. 3 crits in 5 nukes.

Of course, the worst thing in the world is casting, say,  Ice Comet, and
getting a Crit for something like 52 points of damage. >:/
