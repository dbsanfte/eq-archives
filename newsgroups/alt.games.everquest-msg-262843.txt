I think 99.9% of the world finds several of the olympic sports 'beyond 
meaningless'. I know I do. That doesn't mean they are in sad shape.

Conversely, I derive satisfaction and self esteem from any number of 
miniscule tasks that I complete in a day. That isn't 'sad shape', its 
perfectly normal.

Doesn't work. Your argument suggests an olympic gold medalist needs to 
get a life too. They run 100 meters really fast. That is what they have 
accomplished... that is all they have accomplished. And they have spent 
a chunk of their life more focussed on doing that than most of us have 
spent focussed on anything. With a trainer, diet, lifestyle all planned 
around it. That doesn't sound like moderation to me.

The olympic games...(yes that's right... they are also *games*!) are not 
intrinsically more important than EQ. You telling me that running 100 
meters really fast is important?

Note quite. If you are substituting madly pursuing accomplishments in a 
video game to compensate for not having self-esteem you have a real 
problem. However, fanatical pursuit of olympic medals to compensate for 
not having self-esteem is the same problem.

Ok. I agree with what your driving at here. But I still think people who 
buy plaques with acoomplishments they didn't earn should be branded with 
a big L on their foreheads, and then sent in for therapy because they 
probably have a self esteem problem too.
