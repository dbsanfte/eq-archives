"[Mon Jun 04 20:28:49 2001] Guildmember #5 told the guild, 'LoS! Rez!
Pathing! Agro! With our powers combine, we summon forth ITZLEGEND!'"

Sorry, but again, you have more faith in them than I do.  Between
calling their tactics "sploits" and this line I am unable to give them
the benefit of any doubt.  Any "tactic" that involves the use of Line of
Sight, Res Effect and Pathing to work sounds more like a "sploit" as
they like to call them.  To say that parking the mob in a spot it can't
move from is of no advantage is a bit of a stretch.  To be able to
maneuver your raid members into position w/o fear of early attack seems
a bit of an unfair advantage, especially since VI logs show that it was
in fact agro and wanting to attack, but pathing was used to prevent that
from happening until they were ready.
  
In principle I am in total agreement, folks who are doing nothing wrong
do not deserve to be punished.  I just have a hard time swallowing this
as such a case.  If you believe that by pure accident and luck he
managed to agro the big guy, pull him to the bridge and then find the
safe spot where he would not be attacked and the dragon would get stuck
and all of this w/o any idea it was happening, then that is what you
believe.  I just don't feel the same.
