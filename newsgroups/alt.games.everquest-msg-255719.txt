Oh its ok, i don't try to be one of those that, the "we had it harder in my
day! your achievement means squat" type people

The point you missed though, whilst originally the zones would of required
huge numbers, as the game has moved on, the requirements have dramatically
dropped.  YOU in your level of gear and guild could be doing those places
successfully with 30, not 70.

well you use an inability to field 70 people as a reason/excuse for not
doing raidzone_01 or mob_02

Well the reason why people do it 3 years later... is because now they can
clear the zone in a few hours, with just 30 or so velious geared people.
Requiring high-end Luclin gear then no, its not necessarily good value
compared to jumping into PoP... but coming from some place like Velious,
well its easily attainable loot with good hp/mana/effects/focus, in huge
quantities, without a massive online presence.

Btw the quest may sound shit... but imagine being part of a guild supporting
each other to key up... camping parts for others, keeping them company for
the hell camps, in addition to your own.. keys for needed alts, r/l partners
etc.. that was the definition of ultra shit :(

<-- did it 3 times for alt/wife.. and countless times for 1/4 of the guild

Like Ben said, it was a shithole plan :)

Well post a magelo. I bet theres a whole wardobe of gear we could recommend
from mobs that would take *you* less than 3 groups!
