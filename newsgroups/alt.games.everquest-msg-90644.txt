Many experienced players don't realize there's a difference
between ignorance and intelligence.  What you did in Oasis
can probably be described as ignorant.  That's not an insult.

Education and experience solves ignorance.  (Well, usually.)
Even the most elite and experienced EQ players that frequent
this newsgroup had to learn the ropes.

Remember, the first step towards wisdom is realizing and
admitting when you're ignorant.  I had to swallow that bitter
pill when I was wizard-bashing.  Now I see the light.  :)

You just need to learn to ignore the elitist dickheads that
frequent this newsgroup (you know who you are).  There are
plenty of experienced players who frequent this newsgroup that
also happen to be polite.  Listen to them, and ignore the
riff-raff.

Anyway, you can never trust someone who gets pleasure from
insulting people on Usenet.  There's probably something
emotionally wrong with them.  Let them wallow in their own
filth.
