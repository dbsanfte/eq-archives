Everyone keeps saying this, but so far the only stat modifing equipment I've
been able to find is +/- 4 or 5 at most and that doesn't seem like a big
differance, being new to the game it will be months before I can find decent
equipment for even ONE char so I just decided to try to get the best suited
race for the early lvl's
