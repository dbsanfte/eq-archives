Paladins are warriors who have their fighting abilities diminished
somewhat then supplimented with cleric spells. Shamans and Druids both
are "priests", just as clerics. They're both servants of a particular
diety (with the exception of Vah'shir, but their religion appears to
be more of a true shamanistic "spirit worship" than the standard EQ
diety worship). In their race's society, druids and shamans play the
role of clerics for their diety. They are true healers, just not as
advanced at it as clerics. The fact that paladins draw from the same
spell line is irrelevant. Again, Paladins are simply weakened warriors
supplimented with weak cleric spells...
