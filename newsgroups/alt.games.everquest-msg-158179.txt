If the shuttles are managing to zone to TD, when you get to where the boat 
-should- be, jump off and tread water a few minutes.  You can climb up on the 
nose of the boat.  IF you position yourself right against the appropriate bit 
of boat wall and hold the forward arrow down, you can zip through the wall 
when the boat starts moving, too.  But that might be considered an exploit, 
and sitting on the nose gets you to FV just as well.
