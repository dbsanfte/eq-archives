Personally I'd like to see people get a reduced value for an over inflated
item rather than give its new value.
ie. Bookworks were 1100 some odd favor points.  That's ridiculous I agree
but to give people 0 for them just seems somehow harsh (especially if they
had bought them in good faith).  Something that seems more reasonable is
give people 10,15,25 % of the value.  Giving people some compensation
for initiative, but not the ludicrous values that they could have.
