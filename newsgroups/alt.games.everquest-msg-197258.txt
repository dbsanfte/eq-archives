Why do they need to not already have their flags? How about merely 
putting in some time for the good of your guildmates?

No thanks. But then again, that content has been available without the 
flagging system already. It would be a different matter to impose it now 
than on new content for the new uber level range.

If you've done it some 150 times, shouldn't some of those people you 
helped get flagged step up and help others as well? 

I like the fact that some content is exclusive to those who are endorsed 
and accepted by others, and therefore have a support network available to 
help get them there.
