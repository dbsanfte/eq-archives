That movie was the biggest piece of turd I've ever seen, obviously the
product of some asinine espresso drinking leather jacket wearing eurotrash,
but I could tell it was made by me because of the fantastic visual effects,
the script was well written as well but the plot was labyrinthian and
confusing. Other clues that it was mine were the obvious awe and interest in
the female body and the relatively healthy way that it shows men and women
relating to each other.

I still haven't seen what I want to see, and I hope to see it tommorow.
