You know, I did this and it works like a charm. You need to have another
invis/camo capable person in group.
Have him cast camo on you. Wait a bit until just before you know the camo
will land on you, then start casting your teleport spell. If you do this
right, the camo will land on you after you started casting TP :) The other
person has more than enough time to camo him self because the group TP has a
long casting time.

This way you will pop up in Iceclad invisible and the snow dervish at the
ring wil not jump you. If the other person cant camo .. well, load your root
and pray that only one only one dervish is at ring. At level 34 (when i got
the spell) I could usually land a root on the dervish, then gate.
