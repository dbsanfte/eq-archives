My personal favourite is (for a cleric) Imbue Peridot.

Yes, I know it's useful for class skills. To create items which are
deity-specific... thereby making the crafted item useless to 90%
of other players. Plus I don't have any craft skills worth beans. :-)

I'm always tempted to say "I can imbue your peridot... HEAR
ME ROAR!!"

I'm tempted to suggest the Cleric strength buff/debuffs, but they
can be useful if you remember to click them off in time. I've had
people specifically ask me to *not* cast them...
