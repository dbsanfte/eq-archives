DAOC has far greater depth of "world" than EQ has, EQ has all these
zones, but so far just doesnt gell as a world.  If you want to immerse
yourself DAOC just holds together far better.


>I don't think graphics on DAOC is any better than SoL.

THis might be true.  But the graphics in DAOC run fine on a 128 meg
500 mhz p3 system with a old geforce card.  SOL needs far more
resources.

You can say that about EQ.  in EQ its wait for camp, camp, kill kill
kill.......................,  level, move to next zone wait for camp,
camp, kill, kill, kill, level, move to next zone wait for camp......  

Oh you could put together the equivalent of high level raids early on,
but that would cut into time leveling to a level to do the high level
raids.  

Its not to say that EQ isnt an enjoyable game.   But im rather amused
by the EQ hard core fans who dislike anything that isnt EQ ( yah
another corpse run into thehole sign me up, now!).  I have some fun
with EQ, but the repetitivnous and shallowness of the game makes me
glad to have a game thats at least a bit less shallow to play.

I guess if your power leveling it might be.
