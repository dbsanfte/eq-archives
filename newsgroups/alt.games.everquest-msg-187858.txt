Thats actually a very valid point. 

I have many characters, most of them have equipment beyond their
capability of actually getting the drop. It has always been this way
since I created my first character around the time Kunark came out. A
friend of mine twinked my Pally (then full banded was pretty awesome).

So, for the hell of it I created a High Elf Cleric to play with, and
decided that, other than a half way descent weapon (gave him a Velium
Etched Stone Mace) that I would never again give him money or items.
It took me 4 grueling days to complete my newbie armor quests. As I
donned my Sylvan Initiate Breastplate (ac 12, wis +5, and some hp
stat) I realized that I was more proud of the newbie armor that I
*earned* than I was of the really nice equipment I paid for on my
Druid. It also occured to me, that (for me at least) I had found the
secret to having fun in everquest, a very simple secret long forgotten
by many players. So after that I banked the mace I had bought, picked
up a rusty mace from a skellie and started my newbie weapon quest. I
dunno how long it will take to get the quest mace, but I am going to
have a whole lot of fun finding out.

Cheers.
