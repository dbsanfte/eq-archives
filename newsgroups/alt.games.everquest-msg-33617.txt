And enchanters.  If I only have one peridot left, and its between me,
the main tank, and the chanter, guess who gets it?

I'll give you a hint, we may all end up with the same HP total
when I'm done.

Tank has the native HP and AC to withstand some stomping,
and he gets Shield of Words (or whatever AC buff you are
up to) in addition to Herosim (or whichever raw HP buff
everyone is getting).  I've got decent HP and AC, and
on top of my party buffs I've got Armor of Protection.

The enchanter, on the other hand, has squat for AC, less
HP than an SK's pet, and is pretty much guaranteed to
get beat on once every couple fights.  Not for long, in
fact so little time that any melee in the group might not
even notice he'd got aggro... but on a crystal goblet
like an unbuffed chanter, long enough for him to shatter.

OK, so the same is true of the wizard, mage, and necro,
except that it -is- their job not to get the love, and if
they die, its generally not a party wipeout event.  We
finish the fight, res them, buff them back up, and shake
our heads at the added down time.

Chanter goes down and suddenly we are facing a
four at a time overpull instead of a controlled constant
"one at a time and lets take a breather after all these
are dead."
