You know you really CAN'T be too careful.  My partner and I were in the tunnel
at EC a couple weeks ago.  We stood way back in the tunnel as we had some major
swapping around to do with equipment.  
The last thing to go was an empty backpack, I screwed up, it fell to the
ground.  THREE people came FLYING over to try to grab it,  (too late, I already
had it picked back up).  My partner and I were stunned at the SPEED in which
these people reached us.  
Now I am just SURE all 3 took the time to come running over to hand it back to
me.   Yeah right.
Well actually - I would bet at least ONE of those people really would have
returned it without even looking inside, (I would have...) 
Every couple of days someone is shouting about this kind of thing.  I think
it's really sad the vultures that run around EQ...
