Research how to group.  Group outside LDoN, even with one partner, get 
some kind of practice under your belt.

Then, stop sabotaging yourself, don't put up the "I've never done this" 
flag, don't tell people asking you to group that you haven't grouped 
before when they ask you to join.

Once you get to the group and actually join them, -that- is the time to 
gently inform them that you haven't got a lot of grouping exp.  They'll 
all wince a bit, but almost certainly not drop you; the commitment level 
is a lot different when you are already grouped with the person then 
when you are in the midst of forming groups.

If I'm trying to form a group, I may well have 10 or 12 people I'm in 
tells with, trying to get a coherant group out of that.  I wouldn't 
deliberately discriminate against someone who said he had no 
experience... but it would be a negative, when one of the main things 
I'm looking for are positive, upbeat people.

Of all the things my mage has put in the comment line on the LFG tool, 
by far the one that's been most effective is "will blow gnome sized 
holes in things for food".  Its utterly irrelevant, doesn't limit me to 
any one sort of dungeon, group style, or much of anything, and its 
mildly funny but projects a sort of feeling of power.  Anyone looking at 
the tool can see that I'm a 63 magician, so I don't have to describe 
anything, I just have to get attention.  Since half the people on the 
tool don't put anything in comments at all, and most of the rest put in 
something restrictive like LDoN only or POP Tier 3 or GOD... well, I 
seem to get a lot more nibbles this way.
