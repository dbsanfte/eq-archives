Some time ago, I was stalling waiting for some friends to catch up to 
me, so I did enough AA to get Baron... even though just the run 3 or 
even run 2 would have been fine.

At any rate, I'm now the proud possessor of three more AA points, though 
I didn't get them deliberately; they are a bonus for Telling Stories; 
which is to say for getting flagged into various POP planes.

What to do with them?  I've looked at my options, and the thing that 
seems most appealing to me is the suspend pet option... sadly each level 
of that (there are two, I think) costs 5 points.  I could just sit on 
the damn things until I hit 65 and start doing AA seriously.  I could 
look into getting a couple more flags.  I could even put AA on 100% for 
a little while (after getting a safety margin into 63) and push.

Whats the consensus on this AA, and other mage AA for that matter?  Do 
any of them matter compared to leveling up to 65?  (my default advice to 
most classes is to get Run 3 and then ignore AA till 65)

I see a bunch of Gates AA... I assume that those are just there to tease 
me, and I can't get them without buying the expansion.  Ones I might 
want seem to be priced at 15 and 20 points per level, others seem to 
just be further expansions of already existing ones.

I'm frequently grouped with people who are level 61 to 63 who keep going 
on about there AA level, ding 33, ding 45, so on.  What are they 
thinking?  I'm like "ding...ten would be my next one, cept I'm on 100% 
real!"

Did I see a Gates AA that would further increase Run speed?  That might 
be worth the $30!
