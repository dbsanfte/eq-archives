Just a question.  Do you dispute that SOE can legally ban anyone they want
to from EQ for any reason  or even for no reason whatsoever?

Answering that, let's change the question a little bit.  Can SOE delete my
characters or any or all of their items for any reason or even for no
reason?  Let's assume if they do that, or if they ban a person, they refund
the unused subscription so it's not an issue of taking payment for a service
they're not going to provide.  If SOE decides they don't like my bard very
much and they swipe the weapon he was using just out of spite or out of a
game balance issue, or whatever, can they do that to me?  Or do they need a
legal rationalization for such an action, whatever the hell that means?

If the answer is that SOE can do whatever they want in their game, then
you've answered the question of who the virtual property belongs to.
