Sadly, its now 4 seconds, although I hear 3 was the case in the distant haze of
the past.

Duration is not 12 from when you stopped, its 18 from when you sung your last
pulse.  If you keep singing the song it will pulse every 6 seconds.  So if you
start, then stop 5 seconds later, you only have 13 seconds before the song fades.
If you wait 6 seconds you have 18, oddly, waiting would actually give you more
time.

But if you do that, the other songs you have up are wearing off, so while you
extend duration of that one song you start losing others.

So the key is to stop the instant you finish casting, maximizing time on that song
while minimizing time run down off the other songs.

I do 4 regularly.  I'd consider 5 "mythic" too, for normal songs, there are
certain songs that have longer running effects like Selos or Amplification, which
only need to be twisted in occaisionally, making it possible to keep 6 song
effects up almost continuously; I don't think that would count as a 6 twist
though.  I can see how 5 would work with a 3 second cast time and a good
connection (5 times 3 = 15) but not with 4 (5 times 4 = 20... too long, its hard
enough to keep 4 times 4 = 16 up with the little bit of lag between each song)
