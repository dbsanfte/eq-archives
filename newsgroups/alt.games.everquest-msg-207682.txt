 >a nasty bear/kodiak who won't be happy to see you.

Oh, sure, NOW you tell me. I made that trip probably
a dozen times without knowing he existed. My last trip
out, someone had pulled him to the zone and he was on
me like a flash. Like a panicked little ranger, I
started running and made it all the way to the Paineel
newbie zone line before deciding to con him  (there
were a couple of people medding by the zone line and
didn't want to get them killed.) Luckily, he was green
to me and I killed him easily, but that was one panicky,
heart-pounding run.
