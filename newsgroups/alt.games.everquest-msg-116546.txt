Didn't really have to be.  For example, if someone makes a post on 
something and happens to use the word toon, then another person comes in 
and snips the whole post, ingoring the topic, just for the opportunity to 
say "I despise the use of this term to refer to EQ characters" then that's 
just as likely to be inflammatory.  It's akin to picking on spelling and 
punctuation.
