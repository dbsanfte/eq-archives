True true, and there are also a gajillion of them running around the greater
faydark at lower levels...but if you don't like their fundamentals, then
don't play them.

They can still be a nice class if you like grouping. They are ESSENTIAL to a
group's survival.

Basically, and you can also expect the first few levels to be hell, but then
it gets better. If you like Dark Elves but don't want to have to deal with
faction problems, use this.

The XP penalties for classes have been removed. Let us rejoice! Basically,
you're probably gonna be a secondary tank who can also heal if need be.
Soloing at lower levels is easier because of lay hands, but they're good in
a group.

I suppose so, I haven't played rogues much (or with rogues, for that matter)

Again, no exp penalty. Again, you'll be a secondary tank, but your magical
purpose is to weaken the enemies, not to help allies.

My main character is a wizard, and I like him very much. Although your
purpose is sort of two dimensional, it can be quite fun nuking everything in
sight.

Basically, choose whichever character seems most appealing to you, play them
for a while, then move on. Do what you want.
