Hmm. You're talking about killstealing here, and that is a problem
with *anyone* who would do that sort of thing, not just mb wizards. I
don't really think it's relevant to this issue. Just because it would
affect a raid-level number of people rather than a typical six-player
group doesn't make the ks'ing any worse.
