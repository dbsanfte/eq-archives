I've had a 2 monitor setup before - your mouse is "locked" into the EQ
screen so you can't move it onto the second monitor like you can in Windows.

There is a program called EQW (do a google search, it comes up fifth or so)
which will help, but you will probably be banned for it.  I've never used it
myself because.... I'm on a 56k connection, downloading web pages etc along
with eq would be silly :o)
