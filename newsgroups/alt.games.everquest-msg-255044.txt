I know everyone here hate IGE, but you can use him to "transfer" pp as well
as purchase. They give you from 66 - 75%, I used this when moving servers
when a friend could not connect to the server I was on (no idea why, but oh
well) and wanted to play together and there was no character transfer
service with items.

Since I was not on test, I could have done the subscribe to Legends, create
character, give stuff to character, cancel Legends trick, but not sure you
can do that from Test. If you can transfer from Test to Legends, then do
that you can even transfer any droppable stuff to the new character, then
ask for the new character to go to FV.
