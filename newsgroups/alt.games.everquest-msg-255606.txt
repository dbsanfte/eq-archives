    That's all true and applicable also. I wasn't trying to piss on raider
achievements Martin, I was trying to point out that trying to keep up
without being able to mount 70 person raids is *also* tough going.

    With regrets I must inform you that you are unlikely to see such a post.

    But if I can get into that zone I'll certainly try it on :)

    I'd be interested to see the reasoning you use to draw that conclusion -
care to elaborate?

    Depends, what else is like the VT key? I haven't actually worked on a VT
key, since neither of the two guilds I've been in have ever had any
intention of raiding it (and frankly, thank heavens for that, the whole
thing sounds completely shite - I can see how when it was the end game
people would bother, but when it's 3 expansions behind, just no)

    Probably the most unrewarding asshole quest I ever did was soloing
darkforge in my early 30's, after that I pretty much gave questing a big
miss. My best current item is the 1492 Tak breastplate with FT2 - that took
some doing for a guy with no raid gear, but no I wouldn't line it up next to
a multi-raided VT key.

Cheers,
James
