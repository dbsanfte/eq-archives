Everyone picks their own path on that question. How much do the AA
skills mean to you? How much will you enjoy them and how much will they
help you advance later?  I know people who keep dumping part of their xp
into them all the time after level 51. (My wife is 56 and is already a
baroness with her first Archtype skills coming along now.)

I took the other route, which many do. I got three AA points, put them
into runspeed three, and shut the damned AA off and have no intention of
turning it back on until I hit 60. (Dinged 57 this weekend.) RS3 is
widely held as the only truly useful general AA skill, and a lot of the
archtype ones are simply craptastic prerequisites for the Class skills
you want.

Up to you, though. Personally, I live by the motto that Level > All. But
RS 3 is very cool in dungeons, and frees up the inventory slot my jboots
took, so it's worth a short detour on the xp road.
