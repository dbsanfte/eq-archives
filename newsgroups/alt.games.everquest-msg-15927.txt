CB is one of the easiest places to exploit, MOBs don't jump.  Thus anytime you
are near one of those little islands, if you jump on one they run all the way
around to get you.  I had a GM tell me that this was not a valid tactic, I told
him that I thought they were too heavy and not nimble enough to jump the casm,
thus they would run around to get me.  He said as I explained it in roleplay
terms he would let me off, but that I could not use it to kill the mob.  So I
asked if I could use that as a valid means of escaping with my life.  He said HE
would not take action against me for it, but others might.

Moral of the story, always roleplay.
