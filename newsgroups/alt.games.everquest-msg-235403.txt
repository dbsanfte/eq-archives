As I interpret the rules, banning is not used for "too many problems"
but for particularly bad instances of violations of rules 1 and 2. (
Vulgar/Rasist/Offensive names...and compound words that lead to same.)

Since drug names violate only rule 6, banning is not stipulated as a
possible recourse, no matter how many Poke Smots you create.

(Of course this is Sony so nothing is certain,  but at least according
to the policy they would never ban you for "a drug name").
