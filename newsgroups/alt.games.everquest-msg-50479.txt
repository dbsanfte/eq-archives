You want to impress someone, then look up what recession means yourself.
Then come back here and acknowledge that Kevin L Smolnick hit the nail on
the head.  And try not to fly into a panic just because someone introduced a
thread here that isn't about levelling.

The Everquest economy is in recession, even on the newer servers, although
it is not as obvious there yet.  It doesn't just affect loot either.  When
great weapons become cheaper, Verant releases even better weapons to entice
uber guilds into raids.  These weapons reduce the high end MOBs' potential
to foil subsequent raids, so Verant eventually will have to boost that MOB's
combat abilities or have it become everybody's doormat.

How often have you read somebody reminisce about the "good ol' days" when
banded was really something?  Recession is the name of the ongoing economic
event at the heart of banded's fall from its once lofty place.

All of this is somewhat moot anyway though.  The pace of recession is slow
enough that we will probably all have long since quit Everquest before
prices could get really absurd.  But if Everquest were to last, say 20
years, with things progressing the same way they have been, I would not be
surprised to see nice mid to upper mid-range items like the BABS, Yak, etc.
being left to rot because the inventory space was considered more valuable
than those items.

Last comment here.  You accuse Mr. Smolnick of sounding like a newbie in the
pasting above.  Then when he defends himself against the percieved
implication that he actually is a newbie, you ridicule his reply and make
out like he was bragging.  Do you actually think people who read this
newsgroup are too stupid to follow the flow of discussion?  Or do you simply
hope they have forgotten that you are the person who introduced the concept
of time played by your "newbie" comments.  This is not new.  You do this all
the time, in format that follows.

Dark Tyger (note exotic spelling.  Isn't the little thing so precious?)  --
<makes a hostile remark to/about SomePoster>
SomePoster -- I'm sick of your shit, DT.
DT -- Stop bitching on this newsgroup.  <Then proceeds to bitch about SP>
SP -- You stop bitching.
DT -- Hypocrite.  (or for flavor may butcher the metaphor about the pot
calling the kettle black)

Does anybody see the irony here?  I am sure there are many here who aren't
as stupid as Dark Tyger seems to hope you are.
