Probably, but it only changes the racial component of your faction. Faction 
also depends on how that faction views your religion and your current 
standing with that faction (Venril Sathir in this case) from previous 
faction hits, so if you've been camping the fat ogre in TD or hunting in 
Kaesora, or you worship Tunare, you're still SOL.

No. It will give you any special abilities of that race though, so you get 
ultravision in DE form, you can't be stunned from the front in ogre form, 
you get regen in troll form etc.
