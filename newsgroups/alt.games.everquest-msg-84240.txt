When you figure out how to "schedule" Ragefire's spawn, Sev, the Big Ass
Turtle, etc. please post a link to how you do it. Yes, we "schedule"
everything that *can* be scheduled, but there's also times when you're
going to have a cleric/druid camping waiting on Zordak, or a Warrior
team in EJ with a ranger tracking waiting for Sev, etc. Can come at any
time. And no, the message probably wouldn't *literally* say "GET HERE
NOW" but it would be an urgent, all hands kind of thing. And if you have
a ton of people, particularly in key classes, in your guild who think of
guild chat as "blather" and rarely have it on, you either lose the spawn
to another guild and start over, or you try it without sufficient
forces, die, and lose it anyway.
