My friend was over the other day, and I showed him 
http://www.exploitsrus.com/eq.html It is a site with cheats, bugs, 
dupes, etc for everquest. He told me it was against the rules for eq to 
do this. Is this true? I am used to cheating on video games for my whole 
life, so I was sort of shocked to hear this.
