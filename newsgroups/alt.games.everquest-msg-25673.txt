Share Wolf form is a level 39 spell, but druids can turn themselves into wolfed
10 levels before.
See if you cant get a druid to get it for you instead, far more druids can do
that. There is absolutely no danger for the druid, since neither the brownies or
the brownie scouts will attack a wolf.
I have gotten the spell for 10 chanters or so at this time.
