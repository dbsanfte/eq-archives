Absolutely correct.  No better outside group than that.  All the druid
needs to do is regen (if he has it) , sow, track and snare.  He should
never run out of mana.  5 pets and some life taps will take down
almost any mob within reason.  We all remember the 6 level 20 necros
taking down Sand Giants days.  Those same six can take out any mob
with in 6 levels.
