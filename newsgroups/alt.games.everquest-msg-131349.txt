Alternatively the manufacturers of mice could make their software more
friendly.
M$ Give you a selection of function keys for the extra buttons (F1 - 12,
ctrl, alt, shift as well as back, forward copy, paste etc, commands) but you
cannot define it to what YOU want it to be.

Logitech give the same options now but used be much less, older versions of
their software I remember being alt, ctrl and shift only.

These limitations don't matter, so much, for FPS games where you can define
the keys you want in game. So if you want mouse4 to be weapXX then bind
WeapXX to ctrl and mouse4 to also be ctrl.
Strangely the mouse that was designed for FPS in mind, the Boomslang, had
software that gave you total control of the extra buttons to be anything on
the keyboard...just a shame the mouse was so inconsistent for FPS games :�/

As already pointed out, the wheel has worked in Chat windows for ages, every
trader in EC held a party when that was patched :�)
