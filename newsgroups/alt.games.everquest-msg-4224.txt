Personally, I could care less if someone inspects me.  I set the option for
show inspect to off fr that reason.  You want to know?  I don't care.  It's
funny the number of times people say I'm sorry and I have no idea what they
are talking about.

I do wish that the default for show inspect was set to off.  It would save a
lot of this kind of griping.

Oh, dear gawd!  Is it true?  Do I really agree with Bizbee?  It must be.  I
looked outside and saw a pig fly by my window.  It is definitely the end of
the world as we know it.
