Yes, agnostic is best. You need to be able to walk into any city on
Norrath to finish many of your later research quests. Anything other than
Agnostic and you're hosed.

As to race/attributes, the most balanced (IMO) is the High Elf. Excellent
starting INT and CHA - dump all you can into INT and do what you will with
the rest.. won't hurt to toss the rest at CHA, or anything else at all. No
really negative faction problems like the Erudite either and the fact that
you enjoy the GFay / Butcherblock / Crushbone combination is just icing.
(I prefer it myself. Very easy to crack level 10 in a day or two of
 casual play here)
