Hey, my mage and warrior are both 7. If I hadn't given my druid a new
last name when I recreated her, the warrior would have been named
Blackbird (they're sisters) - now she'll need something else. My
shadow knight is going to 'need' a name first, she's 11 now.

A guildie of mine finally settled on a last name the other night, in
her mid 40s :)
