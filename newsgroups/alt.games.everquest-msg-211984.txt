When the ratio is the same, the damage output is the same on average -if- you
don't have a damage bonus or a short term advantage or disadvantage at work.

This still doesn't mean the two weapons are interchangable.  All things being
equal, the quicker weapon will generate more aggro... so if getting and holding
aggro is important, the quicker weapon is better.  If -not- getting aggro is
better, and all things are equal otherwise, the slower weapon is better.   IF
you are facing a mob that ripostes and you are the MA, the quicker weapon will
get you riposted against more.  If you are riposting yourself, the heavier
weapon will do more each time you riposte; advantage to the slower weapon in
both cases.  If the mob has a DS on, the slower weapon will hit less often so
you'll take less damage from it.  If a cleric has put a Mark of Karn or Kings on
the mob, you'll get a little heal every time you hit, so the quicker weapon will
give you more healing.

As others have pointed out, as you level up, melee classes get a damage bonus
which applies to their primary weapon only; faster weapons will do more damage
with the same bonus... but really slow weapons often have bonuses so large they
more than make up for that factor.  In the off hand, no damage bonus applies, so
pure ratio is a fairer comparison.  If you are a cleric or shaman (the only non
melee classes with an excuse of any sort for swinging a weapon past the low end
of the game) then there's no damage bonus at all, and of course no secondary
slot weaponry anyway...
