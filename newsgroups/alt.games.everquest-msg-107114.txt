    I'm a comptroller. Knowing how to put procedures in place to increase
security is my job, in part. You don't get robbed if folks don't know where
you keep the money. Keeping people ignorant of how things work is one of the
best ways of preventing them from screwing with things.

    Ah, but THIS way there's no extra work for them! :-/ Sometimes, as in my
example, a /report is damning enough. Often, though, you'd need the story
behind the /report to make sense of it. If the guide knew who was trying to
rat him out, he could apply all sorts of pressure to the witness and, I'm
sure, make their life a living hell in retaliation. That's not going to
encourage folks to come forward.

    Nope, he was too scared to have any more naming policy violations on his
name. The GM that talked to him was very heavy-handed in his language. My
friend asking him about Fkin's name (level 60 shaman on our server) didn't
help matters, even if he did ask politely.
