I've got a cpl hundred plat worth of leather padding on hand, and my Gnecro
want's better items for primary and secondary slot.

He's a lvl 19 gnome.  He know's he shouldn't be trying to melee, but once in
awhile, he likes to jump into the fray with his pet...  and he want's to
land a hit that matters...

Let's say I've got 500 plat to spend...  what would you recommend that he
purchase?
