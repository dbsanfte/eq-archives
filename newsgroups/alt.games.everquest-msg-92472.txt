Looking at the people I've encountered on Zeb, who have moved to
legends, the people going are the die-hard loot hounds.

The biggest carrot on Legends is unique uberloot, and naming loot after
players. The items coming out of the pirate zone, easy kills dropping
vulak quality loot, are the monty haul EQ they are willing to pay for.

Greater 'roleplaying' and dynamic questing is, predominately, viewed as
a means to an end to attain said loot.

120 L60s signing up blind for a guild with people they know nothing
about other than their level, kinda supports that
