That, I think, is the most important part.  Not eveyone is experienced at
this, and even those who are may have learned bad habits from whoever they
learned from.  Last night was my first raid, and I had to have that
explained to me.  I've been soloing for the last twenty levels, and before
that, there was nothing challenging enough that you had to actually wait for
the MA to get aggro.  So, I would assist (I got rid of that "attack on
assist" option long ago), pounded the key a few times until I was absolutely
sure I was on the right mob, and started swinging as soon as I saw our MA's
swords-a-swinging.  The cleric sent a tell to my Guild Leader, who explained
to me what I needed to do (he's a RL friend from a previous ship, so it's
not like he went apeshit or anything), and the problem was resolved there on
the spot.  From then on, I held my attacks until I saw "Everyone
attack ------------> %t <---------- "

We still got wiped, heading to the Overking's room, but it wasn't because I
broke mez.  Though, I did get to MT for about thrity seconds after our MT
went down.

For the record, I think we were doomed from the start... we had one
enchanter.  Our only rogue was his alt (brought on for the CR).  Our MT was
a ranger, our only level 60 melee.  Our puller was a SK, since we have no
monks.  And we had an ass-ton of pallys.

So.... anyone have any advice for a level 7 monk who needs to get to the
50's quickly?  ^__^;;;;
