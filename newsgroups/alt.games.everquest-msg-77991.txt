Not sure what you mean about taking over the community. Its so
fragmented already with so many servers there is really nothing to
take over. As another poster said these already exist and they are
called uber guilds.

In EQ you can take over all you can as long as it does not interfere
with the play of others. You can kill 12 dragons and gods or uber mobs
in the same day if your guild gets their first and engages them.

I think you might be talking more about taking over large areas like a
town.  You really can't do that in EQ mostly because its pointless.
Sure, it would be possible for your uber guild to kill all the npcs in
freeport such as vendors and trainers but all you'd accomplish is
taking a lot of faction hits and you'd not even get lewt really. After
that they'd all just respawn anyway. If you had the people to do that
you'd go raid things which gave you an actual benefit instead.
