Before you head out to go find stuff to kill for your cash and armor
drops, find a mage of around your level. Can't they summon darn near a
full suit of fairly decent armor? If you're worried about not finding a
mage next time, you could duel somebody before you log off, get killed,
and ditch the armor on the corpse. (I think. Never tried it myself.)

taking up tailoring, get a ball peen hammer and whack yourself on the
head every 15 minutes. Over all, it's certainly less painful, and very
probably more productive."
