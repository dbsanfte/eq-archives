Well... sound like fun, but my idea of fun and others' idea of fun may 
differ, here.  Thanks for the realistic input, you probably saved one of 
our Cleric's a lot of rez mana.  At level 52, I would be one of the lowest 
levels there, though.  But, if they can't be rooted, I would be the main 
source of CC, so it doesn't sound good.

Realisitcally, we would probably have a 61 Ranger, 60 Cleric, a few mid-50s 
rangers, a 53 CLC, a druid or 2, 2 Pallies 53-55, a mage or 2 over 52, and 
then me at 52 and a Wiz at 51 ( I think ).  I tend to be conservative when 
I think of who =will= be there so that I plan more realistically.

Nope, not a raiding guild.  We're one of the rare ones that let any level 
and class join and keep 95% of our members, no matter what level they get 
to because we focus on fun and friendship and they know this before they 
join.  Most of us are over 30 IRL and don't have the time to be a raiding 
guild, although it would be nice to see some of those ubah-lewts some 
day...  That's why I enjoy reading your guys' posts about zones I'll never 
see.  Keep 'em coming.

Thanks again for the heads-up.  I'll pass it on.  It's not easy being the 
only chanter in the guild over level 25 and the only person with a chanter 
as a main.
