Sure, but that difficulty is based purely on level, not on getting a drop
from a place that's nigh-impossible to be in without that drop.

Nobody is saying otherwise (at least not currently).  I'm not even saying that
it's all that impossible now - 69 spells are simply more available than they
were for the first few months of OoW.  

All we're saying is that the way Sony uses level-locked abilities and
difficult spell drops makes it very annoying to play an Enchanter between the
time our current spells get obsoleted and the time we get the new spells.

And situations like that happen regularly enough that some enchanters have
chosen to play a different game, whose owners seem to care more about making
sure people are having fun than Sony seems to.
