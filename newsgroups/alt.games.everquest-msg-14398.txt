Yes, I've seen them - at least their leather tunics are more fit for
snow than old style leather on a wood elf female in Velious is... and
they all get decent kilts.

Now, compare a barbarian leather tunic with a halfling leather tunic.
Same design, right? (We're talking females still) What I'm getting at
would be like trying to get a barbarian lady, who wears medium/large
sizes, to wear a halfling's small leather tunic...
