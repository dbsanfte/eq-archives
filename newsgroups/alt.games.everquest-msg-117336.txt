But unlike other things in the game, there is a very finite number of
times it can be done - specifically, once per server. Finito. Once a
guild does it on a certain server, they are the *only* guild that ever
will.

It doesn't ring my bell, but I can understand how it might ring
someone else's.

Beats me, but I never made that claim (which you already know - I
understand that you're just still looking for an answer).

No, but neither does it mean that you shouldn't question the real
motives behind the people who are complaining.

Oh, I don't know about that. The first dozen kids who did it got
patted on the head. Why not this one? That it's been done before
doesn't make it less of an accomplishment, any more than the other
high end encounters.
