My first ever encounter with someone like yourself was a level 19 when I was
ready to quit because I was so frustrated.  A ranger walked up to me in
Kelethin and started talking to me.  He taught me so many things about this
game.  He explained my role as a ranger he gave me a bow and showed me how
to pull with it AND give up aggro before I ever got hit.   He gave me the
money for my first real decent sword.  When I reached plateaus he sent me
tells congratulating me on my successes.  He retired a while back and as a
parting gift he provided me with schw and barbed ringmail.  I miss my mentor
as I move into the 50's I could use his advice and expertise.
