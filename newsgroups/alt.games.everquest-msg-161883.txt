Hi,

you are wron. The complete quests for all Val Shir can be found on
eqtraders. Look under Tradeskill related quests.

However, the molar part can done by a BL. I did it myself.

The follow up is the Wolfbane quest, and yes, you need parts from all
Classes here. As a BL prepare yourself for happy tradeskilling. You need a
couple of nodrops for tailoring around the 127 trivia. And, to make things
more entertaining you need 5 parts of the piece your making, since the other
Val Shir need their parts from you too.

The reward is kind of dissapointing, but its a fun quest to do. With the
changes of PoP the much neglected Burning Rapier from a quest for Rogues (or
was it Rouges ? <g>) came to new use, being a important item needed in the
advanced forms of poisoning.

Again, check eqtraders, the walkthru is very detailed.

Felineyes
Beastlord of the 45th Circle
