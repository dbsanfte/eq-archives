You forgot the part where, with the HG only 2/3 dead, it goes:
Ensnare fades
Ensnare resisted
Root breaks
Ensnare resisted
You are Stunned
You have been slain by a Hill Giant

or, if you are skittish enough:
Ensnare fades
Ensnare resisted
Root breaks
<duck> out of Ensnare re-cast and train to Feerrott

whereupon you can med up and try again, all the time you spent on the
failed attempt gone with no reward.  I've watched several 34 to 38
druids solo HGs, and partnered with same.  It looks to me like the
breakpoint (where they hardly ever die anymore) is at 39 (maybe 37
with KEI if you're good at avoiding being smushed), based on those
observations as well as how it's gone for my 33 druid hunting mobs
with a lot less hp than HGs.
