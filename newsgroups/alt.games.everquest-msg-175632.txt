How low is low?  If you have all the crusty pieces, thats -44 charisma 
loss. You would have to have quite a bit of jewelry to offset that. I 
know you said that you had some pieces, so it might not be that bad, but 
each piece has at least -4 cha.

I was tinkering around with my equipment yesterday, and if I had below 
100 charisma, I noticed more resists on my charms and mezzes. The 
general concensus seems to be that the higher the charisma, the better 
the charms and mezzes.
