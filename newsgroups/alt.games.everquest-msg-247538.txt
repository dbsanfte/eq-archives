What zone's she in? I've been looking for her for ages. Do you know if 
her breast plate is no drop or not? I want to use it as a muffin tin for 
some really BIG muffins. I found the recipe on a rodent in ak-anon. It's 
no drop and I don't remember it right now anyway, but it DOES require a 
Valkyrie breastplate muffin tin. I do remember that part.
