	Well, that's been a problem ever since the first level 24 camped
the goblins in Butcherblock...  It's got nothing to do with level caps, 
really.  The main thing raising the cap seems to do is further thin out
the opportunities for less than 80 players in terms of groups.  When the
top level was closer to the bottom level I could take my casual level 55
cleric and group with anyone from 45-65.  Now, it seems that the exponentially
tougher content and the higher level cap squeeze available group slots into
75 and higher, and "you can come sit on the ground while we PL our alts, sure,
just dont draw aggro k?"  1/2 :-)
