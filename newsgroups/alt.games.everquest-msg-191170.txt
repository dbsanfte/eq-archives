Apostrophes are used as punctuation to indicate

(1) Possession (the cat's meow, the boys' toys)
(2) Elided letters (can't, won't, ma'am)
(3) Plurals for literals and abbreviations (a's, the roaring 20's, two Ph.D.'s)
(4) Conjugated abbreviations (O.K.'ed, O.K.'ing)

Check out your local style guide for more details on proper usage.
