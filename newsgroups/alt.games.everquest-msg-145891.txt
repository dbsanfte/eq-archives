Damage classes: Monk, Rogue, Ranger.
Sponge classes: Warrior, Paladin, Shadowknight

Cleric: Damage as well as a warrior, sponge as well as a rogue.
And mind you, thats a high end cleric, from 44 to 56 he does damage
like a cleric still.

Tanking is sponge plus damage.  Clerics cannot do not will not
equal a paladin in sponging ability, much less a warrior.  Dodge
capped, no riposte, no parry, lower HP lower AC no disciplines
at all.

Scream all you like about how warriors are the base line for damage,
but I'm never going to take you seriously, I know how much more
damage rogues and monks and rangers put out.  Warriors aren't
a total joke for damage, mind you, but they pale in comparison
to real damage engines.

Sponges are critical to good EQ action, though, someone has
to stand there and suck up the damage the mob is doing while
the rest of us kill him.  Sadly, this doesn't "scale" very well,
a second sponge isn't nearly as usefull, and a fifth sponge is
pretty much without a job.  Similarly, clerics don't scale
all that well, in small groups or relatively easy action, anyway,
a second cleric is one too many, in a raid a fifth cleric is often
one too many and so forth.  Just as with warriors, we now
at least have a consolation prize of being able to do SOME
damage.  And you have to subtract the MOR damage from
that equation, since those won't stack at all.

Whats broken in EQ, IMO, is the monk class, which CAN sponge
almost as well as a warrior in many situations.  Shouldn't be able
to do that, thats screwed up.
