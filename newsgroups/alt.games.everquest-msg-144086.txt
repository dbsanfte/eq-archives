    Read down to see Furor's letter to Rich Waters three and a half months
ago. Some of his points are the usual whining for things to be easier, but
he does point out the legitimate problems with the zone as well.

    Why bother? This is the endgame zone for EQ right now. These guilds go
there because the best items are there. But that's no excuse for Verant to
make the zone a craptastic exercise in tedium. How do you get people to play
your game if playing it is as fun as pushing bamboo shoots under one's
fingernails?

    I won't defend an exploit. But I will point out that there's nowhere
else to go that they haven't already beaten into the ground. The only real
alternative for them is to say "I won EQ, wheeee" and quit.
