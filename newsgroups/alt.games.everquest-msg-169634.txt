Horse on and model off works.

The most brutal form of this (if you care about seeing the new models that is)
is to turn off ALL models.

Its possible to turn some on  in most cases, although a playful enchanter could screw that up for you, I
suppose.

I can assure you, though, that a male dwarf with both dwarf models and in fact most models off, but
horses on, gets the meditation benefits of the horse without any of the graphics or funny movement of the
horse.  I can even duck to cancel spells.

Its very easy to see that this is working, because of a strange bug; with this setup, your mana bar
refreshes as though you were NOT on a horse... untill you cast a spell or click a casting item.... like,
for example, the bridle itself.

Cast down a bunch so you have a lot of mana to make back up.  Wait for a while, standing there, watching
your mana bar crawl upwards ever so slowly as it does when you are standing.  Now click the bridle.  Mana
bar JUMPS up like you just ate a mod rod or a necro hit you with a big feed.

The message does clearly state you need both your model on and horses on.  When you attempt, as logic
might suggest, horses off and your model on, you get the message.  And you get it with horses off and
your model off both.  No message with both on, but I'd have burned my bridle the day I bought it if I'd
had to put up with that horse another minute.  Fortunately, the message lies, your model off, horses on
works fine.

Eventually, I'm sure, they'll fix that.  Pity.
