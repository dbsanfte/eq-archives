Heh heh heh! Sony finally fucked the right ones over this time, the
ones that 'pre-ordered' OoW!

How does it feel to lose all those hard earned levels? How did it feel
when you logged on and saw that you didn't have OoW registered
anymore? How did it feel when Sony's CSR told you you'd have to
re-purchase the OoW expansions again at the regular price?

Whatcha gonna do now? Quit Eq? Call your CC company and block the
charges? Look into a 'Class action Lawsuit'? Nah you'll just bend over
and say "Can I have some more please Mr. Sony?". Pathetic as always!

How many times do you have to bang your stupid head into a wall before
you realize you are being screwed over? Even with the DX9 fuckup that
STILL hasn't been fully fixed you go and buy the next expansion cause
its been overhyped by Sony paid 'independant' websites.

So get up off your fa lazy carcasses and slap Sony square in the face.
Cancel your account, challenge the charges by Sony, and (while
unlikely) check into the possibilty of a CA lawsuit. Hopefully it'll
put Sony out of the online game business and give a wake up call to
the other deadbeat companies out there.

Or you could grease up your ass for Sony's next visit and play EQ2.
