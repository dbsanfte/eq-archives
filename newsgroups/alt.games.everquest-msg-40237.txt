Yeah, next time check to make sure your race can use the stuff.
You said you did, but you did not. Medium leather plainly says size
med and the races that can wear it which are:

Hum, Elf, High, Hef, eru, bar, DEF

It clearly would not say DWF which is in fact only on small leather or
small armor.

Small leather will clearly say(in addition to being named SMALL
leather):

Dwf, Hfl, gnm, Def, high, elf

Large leather will clearly say (in addition to being named LARGE
leather):

Ogr, trl, bar

The overlap of some of the races is because Dark elf, wood elf, and
high elf are sized small/med so they can wear medium and small items.
Barbarian is sized med/large so it can wear medium or large items.
Dwarf halfling and gnome can only wear small, or non sized item. Troll
and ogre can only wear large or non sized items. 

If you want small leather you have to buy it in Rivervale which has a
small race, halflings or go back to butcher.

The only thing I can think of is that you thought DEF (dark elf ) was
Dwarf (DWF)

A future clue is looking for SMALL on such mundane items as leather,
chain, banded, steel plate and fine steel plate. So you want "Small
Banded" or Small leather not just "Leather" or "Banded" armor. Most
better magic types won't be sized but once again look for it to say
WAR and DWARF or ALL on one or both of those. Don't buy things before
you check from regular players or vendors.

Hint: recently the SIZE of items has confused some people as in the
size VOLUME. My ogre war newbie on a server auctioned for a Large
bronze bp, a person said they had one and she went to buy. In the
trade window she saw it was a Bronze Breastplate which is of course
only medium and only for medium races. The person made the mistake of
reading size LARGE which is the size container it will fit in down
below.

So in your case don't mistake the size down below for volume Small, as
being the size. When in doubt ALWAYS look for WAR and DWF or an ALL in
the place or one or more of those.

Go here,

and look over on the left for equipment by body part, do chest. 
Browse through the items and get an idea what I'm talking about.
