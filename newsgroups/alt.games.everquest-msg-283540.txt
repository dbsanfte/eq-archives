Ranger melee has been improved quite a bit lately, however mostly at
the top end of the game.  In any case this is probably the best melee
class for soloing.  Not only can you heal yourself, you can fear kite
at level 22ish.  (Assuming you would get Panic Animal, which I assume
you would.)

If you go with Necro, consider Erudite.  Nice Int boost and I find mine
is welcome nearly everywhere I go, including Freeport, Neriak, and the
OT outpost.  He worships Cazic Thule, if it matters.
