Pre-17 monks die about as much as any other tank/melee class. So
depending on your leveling style (where you hunt and your starting
equipment), you may not die at all.

Post-17 and before FD and mend hit 100+, they die even less.

Once mend and FD hit 100+ (for a non-twink normal leveling monk that
spends a several hours practicing @levels 23-25) they only die when
they screw up, or pull multiple casting mobs that prevent a clean FD.
I don't think I died more than 2-3 times between levels 25 and 45
soloing in SolA, Dalnir, and Crystal Caverns and those deaths all
occurred when I pulled 3-4 casters. Monks truly are one of the best
solo dungeon crawlers in the game once they get FD and Mend over 100.

Monks just don't have the HPs or total AC to survive a failed FD when
you pull heavy hitters on raids. I felt godly and untouchable until I
started raiding :-).
