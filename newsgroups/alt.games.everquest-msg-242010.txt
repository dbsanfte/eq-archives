No wonder they're all bottomposting loonies. :)

}Interestingly under the Remington Stone method of calculating whether a
}newsgroup is top posting (ie you count the numbers of posters not
}posts), the total comes out to 57 top posts, 32 bottom/context posts
}and 10 questions unanswered.

Actually, it comes out to 37 top posters, 45 bottom posters, and 27 
undecided/neither.  Given that the newsgroup FAQ does not specify, and 
more posters bottom post than top, I would defer to RFC 1822 and call it a 
bottom-posting newsgroup.

}Guess I will still be called a liar though.  I hate being called a liar
}more than anything else.

If you -really- hate being called a liar, you might consider cutting down 
on the lying.
