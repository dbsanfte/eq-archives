To dual wield with a Copper Hammer and Sword of the Bloodsworn make a good
combination.  But sometimes mobs will riposte the hell out of you when you
are using two weapons in which case you would want to switch to a single two
hander like a Greatstaff of Thunder.  If you are not main tank (in my high
50s I ended up having to let a pally or shadow knight main tank due to aggro
management) then get a Windblade or WarMarshall's Bladed Staff for the big
DPSs these give(they nice damage bonuses).
