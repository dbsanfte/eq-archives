Greetings.

As stated elsewhere, I am a fairly new player in EverQuest, having
started last year shortly before the 5th Anniversary.  However, I have
been observing my friends play since 2nd wave beta.  As a result of
recent discussions, both here and observed on various message board web
sites, I am becoming curious about the state of current players
feelings towards the current game and their associated memories of the
past game.

The base question is two-part.  The first is what I'm more interested
in:  What memories, if any, do you have of your lower-level days
(1-30)?  The second is also of interest, but slightly less so: Did you
find yourself advancing at a leisurely pace, taking time to explore
everything as thoroughly as your abilities would allow as areas became
more and more accessible, or did you find yourself going after
everything you could tackle to get to the highest level available as
fast as possible?

Mostly, this branched from a discussion regarding EQ's broken economics
which trailed into a discussion seemingly centered around a comment I
see very, very often in all EQ message forums: If you're below level
[50|55|65|70], sit down and shut up because you don't understand the
game.  This seems to indicate that for many, the game has simply ceased
to exist below the upper level mark of for whatever the latest
expansion is.

Again, I'm new to EQ, but a long time gamer.  Most, if not all, the
players I met when I first started are all now 60+, while I seem to
languish at 24 and 16 (I have a 43 SK, but that character is reserved
for grouping with the wife, who has been playing since 2000 and wanted
to be able to group meaningfully).  I have enjoyed the lower and
mid-range levels immensly, and while I look forward to higher-level
content, I don't feel any particular need to rush off and do so; I
might miss out on some truely enjoyable lower-level content.

Me, my lower- and mid- level memories are obviously still forming, but
I do recall with clarity the distinct feeling of accomplishment and
wonder I saw in friends when they first made that trek from Kelethin to
Felwithe back in 2000, and then later that incredible journey to
Freeport and the commons.

My own more recent memories from last year, just before DX9 went into
effect and the boats were still operating.  I didn't have PoP yet, so I
couldn't make use of the PoK books.  As a low-level Iksar, it was quite
a feeling of accomplishment to make the trek across Warsliks Woods
(very scary for a lvl 12),  then across the even more frightening
plains of The Overthere only to find I had to hide and sneak on board
the Bloated Belly.  That followed by the seemingly vast expanse of
ocean in Timorous deep, and finally the trek across the desert at Oasis
of Marr and North Ro, only to find I was hated beyond hated at my
destination.

Now I just take the PoK book to wherever, and they like me just fine in
both Freeport and QEynoS.  I do miss the boats.  So hard for an Iksar
SK to get to Timorous, what with NPCs at both ends of the translocaters
hating me with no way to improve faction.
