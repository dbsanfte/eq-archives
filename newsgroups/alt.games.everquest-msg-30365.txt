With explainations like you've given you were always onto a surefire winner
there.

I did write something about the fact that Euro's as a collective term hardly
conjures up the same thoughts of persecution that has been suffered by Black
and Jews.
Or that you seem to be offended by being called a Euro even tho' you
accepted that you are a European you don't want to be called a Euro because
it is in someway offensive to be grouped with other European countries.
Please explain at which point Euro was used in a derogatory manner?
Like I said, I did write it, then deleted it as it would be a waste of
bandwidth given what you  have posted here.

Feel free to laugh a bit longer, I am sure it's nowhere near as hard as I
was laughing at your comment of your sex life making Springer blush, I can
only ask, why did you feel the need to tell us that?
