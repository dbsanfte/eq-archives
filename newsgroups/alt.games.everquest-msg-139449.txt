Bah. I've read about the loot on the statue. If we get to the point
where we can take him slowed, we'll damned sure try if we found him up
again, even if there's no way in hell we could handle AoW. (Which I'm
sure we never will be.) However, there is one friendly AoW capable guild
on our server who I'd be very likely to tell ahead of time so they could
be ready to try him when he spawned.

The two may be linked, but I for one don't feel any "obligation" to the
uberguilds that we should voluntarily cut ourselves off from statue loot
just because the AoW would "go to waste" or something.  Of course, we
still wiped to Vindi last time, so the conversation is likely to remain
purely hypothetical for some time to come.
