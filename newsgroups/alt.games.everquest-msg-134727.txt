Note that everything here is all in my opinion, which is anything but
humble, bit I have been building PCs for years now and I keep my eye on
things.

> 1.Operating system: Stay with 98se or upgrade to Win xp(any tips
> appreciated)

I've used both, XP Pro (do not use Home, it, to quote doodspeekurz, suxxors)
is much better overall and allows the system to use more than 512MB RAM
properly, and I have tested 98SE machines with 512, 768 and 1536MB, anything
over 512 is worthless in 98SE.

> 2.Processor:Intel P4 2.53(I know AMd is less expensive but i'm a Intel
> person)

Hey it's your money, I'd get a nice socket 478 mobo and drop in the cheapest
price/performance Celeron or P4 I could get until 6 months to a year from
now. Oh, wait, I just did!

> 3.Ram: 512mb of 1066 rdram(if i go with xp maybe 1 gig,not sure)

RDRAM is dying, go with a DDR board (IMNSHO), especially one of the new ones
that supports 200, 266 and 333 MHz memory sticks so you can start with
PC2100 and then move up when the prices drop (you shouldn't have much
trouble selling the 2100 used and recouping most of your expense),

> 4.Motherboard:Not sure yet,it needs to support 1066rdram and not have
> anything
>                          down on mb like(sound or video)

Makes no difference, you can disable those features, and often the
integrated boards are cheaper because they are produced in greater
quantities.

> 5.Video card:Geforce 4 4600(128mb)  or new Ati 9700(128) any help here
too.I
>                        know nvidia drivers have been better than ati in

ATI and EQ have at beast a hostile relationship.

> 6.Sound card:Sound blaster gamer(cant remember the correct name)

Audigy?

> 7.Hard drive: Western digital special edition drive with 8mb cache(100 or
> 120 gig)

Nice choice, although I am a Maxtor fan.

> 8.Dvd drive:I think one of the combo Dvd/cdrw drives(plextor maybe)

Plextor is the best, but the price can be, well, almost as painful as the
top of the line CPU you mentioned above.

> 9.Nic card: Are they all the same?(i currently have a 3com)

3Com are nice, D-Link are the most reliable I have encountered, bar none.
