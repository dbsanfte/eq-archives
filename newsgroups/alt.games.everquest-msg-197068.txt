yep, you right click on them to loot.
It seems really fast to me, so maybe you are currently actually left
clicking on them and dragging to equip? 

I loot the worn items first, then the bags, left to right and top to
bottom from where they start (makes them the same order they were when
you were alive.  Some items are multiple slots, like the lodizal
shield, which will go in one slot always (the shield slot, for
example) So looting items first lets you see that and adjust so you
don't run out of spaces with a no drop item (it would go into your now
empty inventory instead)  Then once you have everything on, you loot
the bags from top to bottom left to right, as I said above.

See, people have had trouble before when their bags were all full and
they looted bags first then they had some no drop item in the shield
slot but something like the lodizal goes in the shield slot, of
course. So then they click on that no drop item to equip and poof! I
think now it always ends up on the mouse anyway, but its best to not
do it that way (as well as always having room for large or GIANT items
in packs)
