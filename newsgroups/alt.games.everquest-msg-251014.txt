The Video card for this level of computer would be a ATI X800 XT

If you hate ATI for some reason then Nvidia's GeForce 6800 ULTRA

Be aware that the GeForce Card takes up 2 slots and requires a great deal 
of power.  All of the X800 and Geforce 6800 cards can be considered to be a 
step above all previous cards and, as is often the case in bleeding edge 
components, are available in very limited quantities outside of OEM's.  You 
may have to wait a couple of months for them.

For the sound card, I'm not a big sound buff but I've had good luck with 
Creative's cards and would go with an Audigy card. 

One way to check on high level components is to see what Sharkey Extreme 
puts in their monthly extreme and high end machines. Here is the link to 
May's Extreme Machine.
