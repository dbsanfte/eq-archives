Timothy is talking about Everquest, you are talking about Everquest 2.
I think this will lead to confusion...

Anyway, if you want to improve your character, there are lots of
crafters who will be happy to sell you equipment, as well as groupers
who have gotten nice drops they don't need.  As a soloer you will
never get as good equipment as someone who groups, but in my
experience the big money is to be made from harvesting and selling the
results, which is a solo endeavour, so it should be possible to do
fairly well.

Except, of course, killing solo mobs and doing solo quests...  I can't
speak for above level 26, but so far there are quite a few quests to
do solo, a number of them even repeatable.  Also quests never grey
out, so you can do quests that involve grey encounters once they
become soloable and still get the reward, though they may no longer be
worth the effort.

I haven't seen many quests that started out as obviously solo quests
and then turned out to require a group - the only one that comes to
mind is Tinkerer Spindlecog's quest, which starts with killing two
kinds of solo mobs and then turns out to require kill tide octopi,
which are group mobs.  It would be nice if quests were marked group or
solo though, so one could tell in advance.
