From the shadows, the mysterious "slapfish" <slapfish@yahoo.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

I gave up on pickup groups forever when in ME with my ranger, on an
accidental two pull the enchanter *gated*, the cleric DAe and ran to
zone and the monk feigned a mile away. After rooting them both (with
ease) I told them all to get back here and help me kill them.
Disbanded after that with a contempt for the skill level of the
average player that will never be eased.
