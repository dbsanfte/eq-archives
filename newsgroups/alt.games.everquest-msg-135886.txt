Uhh, I _have_ a job. And I really don't want to spend all weekend
digging through my stuff in storage. One that pays almost as much as
my last one. I started last week. I'm only staying with my parents
until I can pay off some debt, get some recent work history, and put
some in savings. That's the reason why I was able to buy a GeForce 4
and I'm allowing myself to play EQ again. I figured it was better to
pay the $13 a month to play a game I already have rather than spending
a whole bunch more on other entertainment. So next time keep your
mouth shut before you make unwanted editorials that make you look like
a moron.
