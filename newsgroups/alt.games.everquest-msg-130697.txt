}Why would they design it in such a way?

I've long wondered that myself.  Three possible reasons. 

(a) Oversight... an artifact of how the zone was created that they never 
quite cleaned up.
(b) Where the wall is may have some effect on mob pathing that isn't 
immediately apparent.
(c) Just to mess with you.  I would suggest taking it personally. :)
