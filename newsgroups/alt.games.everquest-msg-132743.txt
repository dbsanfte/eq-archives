Ok.  FT items are harder to come by than JBootie type items.  I'll
concede the point.  

Druids still solo better than Enchanters though.  :-)

Yeah, but how much does a reasonably high level rune cost to cast each
time?  Rune I only costs a Cats Eye Agate, so that's like 2gp a cast.
Rune II a Bloodstone at 5gp a cast.  Rune II a Jasper at 7gp a cast.
Rune IV and up costs a Peridot at 12pp a cast.  Assuming we're talking
about normal characters and not uber twinks, that can add up for most
people.

Well, the didn't even introduce Lesser Succor until Bogart was level
51, so I can't say I know your pain.  :-)
