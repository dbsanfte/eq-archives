AFAIK you can still sort the servers in population order at the server 
select screen.  Try doing that at different times of the day to see what 
you find.  If you're able to consider Stormhammer you might find a lower 
population there.

Anybody know what was the most recent new server started?  Could check 
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsarchive.jsp I guess. 
Looks like all the recent ones have been split or European.

Sort by population might help here, since other people starting new 
characters will probably do what you are doing.  But with character 
transfer an option, you will probably find older characters everywhere.
