I am similarly interested in this, on behalf of a 53 Paladin chum.  I 
would vastly prefer something easily camped by a 65 dru/65 enc combo to 
parting with my hard-earned cash.  

I remember when PoP first came out, Windblade was teh shitz0rs, then it 
went into a period of disrepute, largely due to its tennis-racket look, I 
gather.  How does it really stack up against its apparent closest rival, 
WMBS?  Is there something better than both of these an eye should be kept 
out for?
