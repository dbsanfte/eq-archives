They did very well with PoP.  It's launch was *much* smoother than, say,
Luclin.  People were comparing Luclin to Anarchy Online's early days.
That's how bad that launch was.  PoP, on the other hand, was smooth enough
to approach DAoC's launch (either the original, or Shrouded Isles).

Sony could make better use of the test server, though.  One way to do that
would be to provide a way to copy an existing character over to Test.  Make
it automated, so that CS doesn't have to get involved.  Since there would be
no way to copy back, it should be safe...even if there are bugs, the worst
that would happen is that someone gets a messed up test character.
