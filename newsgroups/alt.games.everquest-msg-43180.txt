Both of these are untrue.

A broadband connection (actually, any digital connection) will have a LOT 
less latency than a dialup connection. The reason for this is that the 
packets do not have to be translated into sound and back again, they are 
instead transmitted in their native digital format. This means lower ping 
times and faster responses all around.

As for an internal "modem"(which is actually a WAN router or switch, as 
'modem' means modulate-demodulate, IE a description of converting binary 
data to sound) speeding up ping times, this is just plain wrong. A router 
with no added services as overhead(IE NAT, port forwarding, multiple 
routes, etc) transmits packets at near wire-speed. Internal 'routers' use 
CPU time to be routed, which eats up processor and RAM. The assumption 
about ping times I assume you are making is based on traceroute results, 
which are flawed for several reasons. Firstly, traceroute (and ping) use a 
layer 4 protocol called ICMP, which is de-prioritized in most routers so 
that TCP and UDP connections get higher performance. Also, an ICMP message 
gets acted upon when received, IE the router has to slow down long enough 
to think about the packet and formulate a response appropriately, as 
opposed to simply reading the first few bites and sending it on down the 
line. Thus, you end up with a large discrepency here. Look at these two 
tests from my linux machine on the end of a dsl connection(I have removed 
my IPs and those of my ISP):

You can clearly see that the times here do not add up to the ping response 
times, which makes using traceroute as a diagnostic tool a bad choice in 
that situation.

What WILL increase your overall happiness playing, however, is blocking 
ports like port 80 at the roouter, as they will never make it to your 
machine that way and your machine will never have to think about them. They 
still clog your bandwidth, but they don't clog your machine.

Also, don't use a software firewall- they are pointless. Your broadband 
router probably has a firewall built into it- do a bit of research on it. 
If you must use some other form of router, a consumer hardware firewall 
(~200-300 bucks) is an easy solution, or an old Pentium 100 with two 
ethernet cards and Linux(with the routing kernel module compiled in and 
ipchains) is a bit more technical. Both, however, will give you much better 
security and performance.
