So in other words nearly everything in PoP would summon.

At level 65, your exp is severely limited (preliminary reports put light
blue cons as high as 57) to PoP, and the deep parts of older dungeons
(castle in velks, chardok royals, juggs in seb, HoT, deep kael - temple and
throne room, royal guards in Icewell, etc).  By renerfing summoning
mechanics to just be "if MobLevel >51 then Summoning = true" you completely
kill soloing for nearly every class, except possibly enchanters (charmed
pet), Druids (charmed pet), Necros (charmed pet) and some hybrids, and even
then if relying on a non-DC pet, death rates will climb significantly when
faced with your prospective target AND ex-pet summoning you and asswhooping
you.

I don't like quad kiting, but there's better ways to nerf it than just
making everything summon, since that would kill ANY solo prospect.

Just because every time you log on you have a group of friends shouting
"Hey, come join out group in PoV for phat exp!" and then you whine when some
assjack wizard trains you gives no reason to call for nerfs against an
entire group of people who aren't as fortunate as you to have a group going
every time you log on.

Quad-kiting has always been a relatively limited tactic anyways, and since
they implemented 60+ targetable AEs for both wizards and druids, it's a
tacitly approved tactic, by making it so that anything worth exp at 65 by
quadding summons, they'd be rescinding their position.

The screw up was making summoning originally a blanket flag of anything
higher than level 51.  Bosses/quest mobs should summon, there's no reason to
not let them, but trash exp mobs should NOT, especially in outdoor zones.

Making the deeper tiered planes in such a way that everything summoned would
be reasonable, but for the first 2 or 3 tiers, summoning should not be
overtly present like you seem to imply that it should be, since those planes
are basically the only solo exp 60+ that isn't light blue asschunks.

In conclusion, you're a dumbass, and probably a melee class.
