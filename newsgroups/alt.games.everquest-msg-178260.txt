Vastly more complex.  Tens of millions of lines of code and tereabytes of
data over heterogenous networks.

The clients did, yes.

Thousands of simultaneous connections, perhaps millions of people trying to
subvert them.

No, it was metered usage.

What do you mean by "same-day response to bugs"?  If you mean fixing the bug
in one day, we did that too.  What we didn't do was leave the system down
while we fixed it.  That was my point.

You're imagining differences that aren't there.  EQ could be kept online
continuously with enough effort.

Correct, but it leaves them more vulnerable than they could be.  The less
you spend on customer satisfaction the easier you make it for your
competition.

It was comical.  They repeatedly failed to order enough bandwidth and
repeatedly crashed chunks of the internet architecture.  I can forgive that
more easily than the recent down time.  It would have been foolish to invest
in bandwidth before they had a good usage model.  Now they've had 3 years to
tune their system.  Downtime is no longer a mistake but a calculated risk.
