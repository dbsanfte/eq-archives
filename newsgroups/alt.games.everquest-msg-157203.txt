Theres very very few times im grouped as healer, and my lvl 58 druid heal
doesnt fix them up to 100%. The fact that you may call it weak in comparison
is largely irrelevant. Its big enough.

I dont think the shammy heals are as good as the druids are they? If you
have a enchanter to slow, then maybe a druid with snare and evac is a better
choice.

Thats very nice for you, but most pick up groups will take whats good for
them. if a druid is more use than a cleric, then the druid will probably get
in. No use saying you dont think thats good, cos thats how it is :P

Again, thats how most pick up groups work. You may not like it, but thats
