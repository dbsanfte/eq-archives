I have a router that has a cable modem plugged in, a DSLmodem plugged in, an 
ISDN modem built in, and a 56K modem built in. I do not have an ISDN line, 
but I have all 3 of the others setup.
Cable & DSL are setup to load balance across my network and the 56k is setup 
if both the other two connections are down it will connect and service 
requests. All 3 are different ISPs so this won't be 100% scientific.

I have done some tests using any 1 of the connections just to see what 
happens. Only playing games I can't tell the difference in cable vs. DSL 
with as man as 6 instances of online games (2 EQ and 4 DAOC) when it is on 
the 56K there is  a bottle neck. With 1 instance of an online game the 56K 
line only has issues in places with lots of people coming and going.
If I add in streaming radio, the DSL line has issues keeping up for 6 
instances, but none for 2.

So bottom line, if DSL is affordable to you it is better than dial up, if it 
is not dial up is fine for singular instances of games.

(Note, no reason to tell me the load balancing setup stuff is silly, I hear 
it from my wife all the time - well until she wants to download/upload 
pictures with her mother while the family is playing games :) )

I know around me (Indianapolis, IN, USA) DSL is only 19.95 extra a month 
over the cost of the phone line for a year commitment, pretty good 
considering cable is 44.00, hmmm maybe I should look at a second DSL account 
and dump the cable...............
