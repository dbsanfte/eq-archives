When I bought the game in May of 2004, the book that came with the
cdroms and the character creation screens let me know the character
races had different starting cities. But I vaguely remember it also
being mentioned all could group. Of course, thats after pok.

I could be misremembering, but I had to evacuate for Hurricane Katrina
and that computer and cdroms, etc. are likely lost.

D.J. on the road.
