i totally remembered this today, about 4 hours after posting...

"NADOX" just jumped in my head, and there it was...i must have been dreaming

is the other way in through the mines? isn't there a bridge over a very high
pit (lava at the bottom, right?) that's right by a zoneline? or is that a
different zone?

stupid mobs all have too much hp in loy...stupid pumba too

thanks, graeme
