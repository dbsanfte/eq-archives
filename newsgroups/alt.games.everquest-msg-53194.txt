I really wish people would quit saying that you "have to go on a
Kael raid" to get CoV faction to a point where you're not KoS.
It's simply not true.   For a level-appropriate person, hunting
frost giant scouts and drakkal wolves in Great Divide will not
only take you to max ally status with the Coldain but also allow
you to walk around in Skyshrine.   I know;  I've done it without
"raiding" Kael.

Yes, an Arena raid in Kael will get you bigger faction gains than
hunting in Great Divide (or Iceclad or Eastern Wastes) for the
same amount of time.   But you can get groups to hunt giants
in Great Divide and use that not only for experience but faction
building and successfully reach ally with Coldain and non-KoS
with CoV.

(In general, you should be non-KoS in Skyshrine when you reach
max ally with Coldain if you only ever hunt frost giants outside.
One certainly wouldn't be KoS to CoV by the end of another
session after reaching max Coldain faction.)

On the strange-but-true side I believe it's possible to get non-KoS
to CoV without altering one's Coldain faction.   Storm giants on the
Wakening Lands side of Kael give +CoV, -Kromzek, and -Krommif
faction but no Coldain faction.
