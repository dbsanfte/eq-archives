Add a person or two and you'll do great and have good exp and loot if
you just stick to the zone.  If you fee froggy you can head to the
right once you get over the bridge there are some good pull spots over
there.  you'll definitly want to add a chanter/bard and a feign puller
to go to those areas

Good luck
