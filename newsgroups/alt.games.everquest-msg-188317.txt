You're right you have caused a whole shit storm of trouble. They were
talking about your post last night in the Bristlebane Bazaar (as well as
others servers, from what I hear) and apparently there are GM's working on
finding out your account info from your posts, if you can't log in later
today you know they were successful. On top of this, the 3 big boys on BB
(AO, Fu and RoV) have formed an alliance to permacamp the zones where
spiderling and spider silks drop most commonly, thus blocking this cash cow
for new players, completely.

I hope you are satisfied with the outcome of your irresponsible actions.
