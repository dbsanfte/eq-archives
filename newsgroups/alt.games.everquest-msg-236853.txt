Time to roll out one of my favorite stories...

As a young dwarf warrior fighting the orc hordes near Kelethin, I got tired
of running back from Butcherblock whenever I died.  Well at 12th level I
still had not bothered to ask for a bind near Kelethin, but now was the
time.  I stood near the path leading to Crushbone, and asked in the zone,
and shortly an Erudite showed up and offered to cast bind on me.  He asked,
"Are you Sure you want to be bound Here?"  to which I said Yes.  He cast; I
gave what gold I had (having recently given my one and only platinum piece
to a lady who cast Spirit of Wolf on me), and he said "GL" and left.

This was where begun a hard lesson in the 'Z' axis of Norrath. You see, I
had said 'Yes' to being bound on the Elevator near that woodland path...and
with said elevator in the UP position. Now, should fortunes of battle cause
me to return to my bind point and the elevator was UP then things were well.
But if the elevator should be down...well, if you have ever seen a "Coyote
and Roadrunner" cartoon you know the expression on my face for that breifest
of moments while I hung in mid-air, then the ground came up to greet me...

...Now you know, the rest of the Story...
