Damn Dennis.  You care to provide a cite or two for that "fact"?  :-p

Oh, and I do disagree with your opinion there.  The problem isn't that
casters can affect combat directly.  It's that casters can spend all
their power in a brief span of time, which doesn't hurt in a PnP game
but causes incessant whining about "downtime" in a video game.  So, as
I suggested, one solution is to take that choice away from them.  Don't
give them the option of expending 20 minutes of "realtime" combat power
in 1 minute, force them to expend their power over time as the melees
must.
