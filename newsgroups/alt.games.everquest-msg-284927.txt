The fastest solo experience for me, 4 years ago, was fear kiting.  Back
then, the gear available to a ranger of that level was far weaker than
it is now.  Still, you will probably do better fear kiting than
tanking, even with better gear.

Fear kiting is not difficult.  Toss ensnare on an animal.  Cast Panic
Animal.  Hit it on the back side, reapplying Panic Animal often.

-Figure out how they path.  Find a good place to start fearing and drag
your animal there before casting fear.  When you get too far away from
your safe area, let him chase you back to where you first cast fear.  A
feared animal will not fight back but if you get close to his friends
you will get adds.

-Reapply Panic Animal often.  It is a relatively short-duration spell
but it costs little to cast.

-If you can't snare it easily (if mobs of this kind resist snare more
than half the time, say) then you also won't be able to fear them
reliably.

At 37 you could try a few different zones.  Eastern Wastes (elephants
and a few other animals around the zone) Stonebrunt Mountains (panda
bears should be mid-30s level?) Hollowshade (Owlbears might be around
the right level there).  I don't recall what level I was when started
killing bats in Tenebrous Mountains.  I may have been a few levels
higher than you are now.  They were great experience but it was
dangerous and they are unsnareable.  If you do end up trying them, put
the camera over your head (F9) and look down at yourself and the bat.
This is easier than looking up at it.

Some other zones to try as you level up include:

-Jaggedpines Forest, (early-40s through late 40s)
-Western Wastes (Early 50s through late 50s)
-Plane of Disease (early 50s, careful, only try to fear the diseased
rats.  All the other animals present problems)
-Plane of Justice (also early 50s through late 50s, but this may not be
an option since you will get adds until you hit level 57).
-Plane of Nightmare (Nightstalkers are animals if I recall, though I
never tried them in that level range.  Careful, they are hard to single
pull, plus it can be hard just getting to them without dying.

Your other solo options include bow kiting, (which is not even close to
practical until you get to level 59 and buy your archery AAs,) and
tanking, which may or may not be more efficient than fearing.  For the
later option, the more money you have the better.  Healing and clarity
potions, "twink" gear, and "uber" weapons will make all of the
difference.
