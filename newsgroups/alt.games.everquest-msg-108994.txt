Unless it was fixed *very* recently, the higher level practice rune
recipies are broken, and have been since they were put into the game.

For the OP: Try to collect all of the runes for each spell level you
pass, and the upcoming one, that you can. Use the previous level runes
to keep combining and getting skill-ups until either it trivials, or you
run out of runes. Plus, you can sell the resulting duplicate spells back
to the vendor for cash, or to other players. Then use your training
points to finish it up. That'w worked for me so far on two INT casters.
(Oh, and yes... wait until at least 24, if not 29 to start putting
points into research. If you ask around, you'll find a wizzy who will be
willing to combine your runes for your first few levels of research only
spells for you. Just bring the runes and the book with you and be polite
about asking.)
