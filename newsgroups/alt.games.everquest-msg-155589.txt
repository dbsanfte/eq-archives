The reason I don't is 'cause soloing is boring for me when playing my
enchanter...even if I'm duo/tri-boxing.

Jabober does kick ass though, doesn't he?  Toss an SoS (or faster) and a
weapon at him, and MAN....  Add a Bedlam (free Rune) and a Feedback
(DS...earring most of us have by low 50s) and it cuts downtime down even
more.
