The role playing aspect of the game seems to be fairly non existent, in my
experience. Last night I was invited to a guild :-

<them> Hi, would you be interested in joining a guild?
<me> Maybe, what numbers/levels have you got, and what expectations does
your guild have?
<them> Well, we've only just started, but we are a role playing only guild
<me> Sorry, I'm not much of a role player
<them> It's ok, you only have to be /role

I started an alt on FV, just to do the "start from scratch with no twinking"
thing. I've yet to encounter any role playing other than a few "well met"s
in PoK.

I'm sure there are role players out there, but I'll be damned if I can find
them.
