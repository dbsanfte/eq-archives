You should really have a chanter for Mistmoore, unless you have an
experienced Mistmoore puller or your bard group-mate is VERY good at crowd
control. Pulling one mob in this place can pull 2 or 3 rooms onto you, so
watch out.

The best thing for you to do is invis...go to the area outside the graveyard
gate. Go left down the passage into the canyon. Here you can either kill the
stuff here for xp (remember to invis again b4 moving on) or continue up the
ramp at the other side to the bridge leading into the castle. Here again you
can kill the mobs hanging around the bridge (invis after) or continue over
the bridge into the castle. There are about 5-6 spawns inside the door where
the two sets of stairs lead upwards. If you continue on in between the
stairs there will be two entrances, on your left and right, to the Ballroom
where Mynthi Davissi (the MM drums, Lute of the Gypsy Princess mob) spawns
with a few friends. This is where you should set up camp.
Your puller can pull from the front entrance area (with the two sets of
stairs) and the two small octagonal rooms on either side of the corridor you
were in when you entered the Ballroom. If you are feeling good about the way
your group is working, you can pull from the piano room or the ambassador
room, both of which are off the octagonal rooms, this will show you how well
your group is actually working, because whichever room you pull will be down
on you like a ton of bricks.
Mezzes are VERY handy here, but it is possible to take these rooms by
root-parking the melee mobs and killing the casters, who can blast you for
quite a few HP.

Rule 1. Kill the casters first.
Rule 2. Mez or root the melee mobs, or you will end up with one dead healer.


If the map you downloaded is the EQ Atlas one, do not pull from rooms 16,
17, 18 to the ballroom, the mobs have a habit of dropping into the
ambassador room on their way back and picking up their mates. You can move
you group to these rooms and fight in them, or in the corridors outside with
no problem at all. Also in the small room in between the ambassador room
(11) and the kitchen (16) there are two gargs that spawn on a ledge, that
dont always agro when you run under them, but will join any mobs that you
pull past them.

As I say, pulling can be a nightmare in this place, so make sure someone has
evac memmed, and hope you arent the one left behind).
Mistmoore is one of the best zones in the game IMHO, nice xp, nice loot, but
it is also very dangerous. I pretty much lived here from level 25-35 and I
go back there quite often now.
