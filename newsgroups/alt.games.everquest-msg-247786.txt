Yes, but unless you have mega-bucks to spend you don't buy a graphics
card when it's brand new, you buy it whenit's already been out for a
year (and has fixed drivers as well).  As to what we will gain from
DX9, that remains to be seen ... we are giving them a nice free test
for their EQ2 code at least 8(

Pass on that ... have the changes really fixed the problems?

Hurray, one bug down ... 999 to go.

If they really cared about the bugs they would have pulled developers
off the expansion to fix the existing code first.  Was pretty
tactless, the timing of the announcement of the new expansion.

Would much rather see them working on bugs and class balance etc
before they bring out a new expansion.

Biggest problem I see at the moment though is not any of these its the
in game suport.  Ignored/deleted petitions and getting the run around
when you try to raise the problem on the website ... "please petition
in game".  They could learn a lot from the support on city of heroes.

Goodbye Sony, come back Verant all is forgiven !
