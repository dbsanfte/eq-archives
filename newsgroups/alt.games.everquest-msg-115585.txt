Likely kos in erudin. You must be indifferent to the woman you turn the
Inny's kiss of death into to get the erud's tonic, or she will ignore you.

DE necros start kos in rivervale... need rivervale merchant faction for the
actual quest.

You don't need to worry about Frostbite as he is kos as hell to dark elves
and also kos to wolf form. Also the regurgetonic people would be kos to you
as well (surefall glade, Akanon). You have to just kill da fish. Make sure
you con it first though... sometimes it spawns as a level 50 mob (Rodcet
Nife incarnate)

At least 'High Indifferent'. If you are just barely indiff, you will be
unable to do the turn in.

The only class I've seen able to do this quest constantly aside from
enchanters are wolf form capable druids.
If I were that desirous of the stein, here's what I'd do:
Make a new char, dark elf enchanter
get to level 8 (really, this should not take more than an hour)
Do quest.
get a friend to transfer all the loot you made as an enchanter to the necro.
