I'd be interested as well.  Also, the Grikbar Kobolds seem to have decided
not to give up their scalps anymore.  This is of course, the single common
ingredient to all the caster newbie armor for Ak'Anon.  You need 21 of these
for all pieces, assuming no failures.  I was getting them fine at first,
but, have not seen one for the last 2 or 3 levels of killing those bastards.
