I would have to say one of the biggest culprits of inflation on most servers
is the realitive inexpensive fake money. ige.com and mysupersales.com sells
50k for 48.95. Only one month ago the same 50k sold for 69.95. If you don't
have to work for the cash (so to speak). You will roll through the Baraar
like a madman and not look at the price of the items, and if your run out of
pp you just pull out the plastic and charge another 50k and get what ever
you want.

The Second problem I see is that LDoN has created a vaccuum in the game.
Since it came out no one wants to farm the old zones and get the time tested
like Silver Chitin Hand Wraps and Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate. I personally
don't have a toon that could get into many of these zones right now, but
once I do I will be farming some of these items. The other day I wanted to
buy soulstripper. It's not a great weapon, but it is a weapon that can hold
its own. I looked in the Bazaar and the toon that had it wanted 15,000 for
it. I guess I'm lucky cause a friend of mine that has a lvl 65 Neco is going
to camp the NCP that drops it and hopefully I will have it by this time next
week.

I'm not blaming the folks selling fake money or the folks that have been
around for sometime not farming like they use to, but when you put the two
together you have a problem. A lot of fake money and a lack weapons/armor
that people really want.
