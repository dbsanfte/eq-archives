The only zone where I have seen the LFG tag used and watched for is
Old Sebilis.  It'd be nice, maybe, if people used it everywhere, but
neither you, nor I, nor VI in all their glory has any way to enforce
the use of the protocol on the player population at large.  Most folk
who are willing to group/partner don't bother with the flag, so leaving
it off means absolutely nothing to a player or group looking for more.
It would've been more useful to add a DWG (Don't Wanna Group) flag.
