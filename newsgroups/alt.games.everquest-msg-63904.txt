Melee lvl faster, especially at lower lvls... 1. a healer is not as
much of a necessity as it is at higher lvls. Groups tend to be melee
intensive, and they just deal with the downtime since they have few
HP.  2. Every class/race combo levels at different rates.  Rumor says
they did away with this, but I have not seen a difference.  Used to be
Halfing Warriors leveled the fastest and Troll SKs the slowest. 
Clerics are pretty high on the penalty list as well.

Clerics should never have probs getting a group.  If you are soloing
with your cleric, you're not getting the best exp.  Necros are great
solo'ers and are hard pressed to find a group.  The big secret behind
exp is dungeons.  Experience flies in dungeons as opposed to outdoors.
At your level (for your cleric), try paw till 35ish.  Move to SolB
till 40ish.. From there to 45 you can pretty much go back & forth to
solb & lguk.  imho, lguk is better exp till 45ish.  while solb seems
better kill for kill on exp, there are far less trains in lguk and it
seems that the players are more experienced and more chanters there
for crowd control than solb.  by the time you're 45, if you cant get a
lord/magi group in lguk, go back to solb and try to get in a bat or
bugs group.  at 49 exp will slow down here, head to vlab or, if you
can get help with getting a key, get to old seb.  exp flies here. i
went from 49 to 53 in 3 days here (thats really good cuz exp in the
50s is unbelievably slow).  Note that clerics are prolly one of the
only classes I know of that can squeeze into seb and frequently get
groups as low as 49... tanks simply die too fast at 50 there, and are
usually hardpressed to get a group.  Tanks seem to be more welcome
around 54ish.  Another sweet spot where exp flies post 50, Chardok. 
This place is _the_ shit for exp & loot.  at 54 hell lvl, i gained 3
blues in 2 hours... that is crazy when it takes me 2 hours for 1 blue
in seb, and seb is good exp.  as far as loot, everything is random
drop in seb, not just named sarnaks.  last night, as we were headed
out, the sos dropped (20k monk,sk,pal staff) and as we killed him, we
got an add that was sporting an sbs (10k shield).
