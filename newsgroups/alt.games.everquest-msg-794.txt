Monk really isn't any simpler than others, because it demands a
thorough knowledge of dungeon geography, spawns, etc.  Also you face
challenges in weight limitations and hard camps for quest items.  Also
you get no learning in magic and it is hard to grasp group tactics
playing a pure melee character.  I would not suggest it as a first
character.

Unless you have a highly aggressive personality -- in which case monk
or warrior would be your best choices -- I would recommend any of the
following:

Druid -- halfling or wood elf.
Shaman -- any race
Mage -- high elf

Really, if I were going to pick a character just to play to level 30 or
40, I would include ranger.

Druid is the "easiest" class to play.
