Funny, I've sat in taxi:taxi for hours offering 30pp for a port before
giving up and running (got two accounts now, one with and one without
PoP - and considering how few ports I can get when I need them, I'm
highly tempted to just say 'screw it' and PoP-enable the other account
as well :p).  Oh, and I'm not usually the only one.
