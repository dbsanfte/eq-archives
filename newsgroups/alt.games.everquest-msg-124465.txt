Dweeb I play both at high levels .Go kill aary with casters :p

Casters are *easier* to play . Absolutely as ridiculous as it sounds 8/
First game I have ever played where the casters where the easy choice but
not the most powerfull in the long run.

Since you play a ranger I understand though. You are gimped by design since
you decided to take the easy way out and have a few spells. A jack of all
trades is never supposed to do everything top notch which is what the ranger
whiners always want. Funny thing is they always bitch about druids which are
20% cleric and 40% wizards while rangers are 80% rogue and 40% druid.

Oh and ranger bow dammage is just obscene now. You should get it and start
using it before we notice and nerf you :p
