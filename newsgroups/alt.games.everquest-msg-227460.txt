Solo 40 can get slaughtered at Ass/Sup quite easily.  The Ghoul
Assassin will use Hide (you need See Invis to spot him), and he
can See Invis (meaning any Invis, Invisibility to Undead does not
work against him).

One thing worth noting if you're trying to break the Ass/Sup loft
solo (or with a group that isn't strong enough to take it on at
full spawn), is that if you aren't a shorty you can just peek over
the top of the ladder without getting agro.  This will allow you
to target mobs in the loft for spells that do not require LOS,
like the Lull-line spells, for instance.  It's been a while since
I hung out in LGuk (well before the Lull "fix", I stuck Soothe on
every one of them and still got all three on the pull), so it's
possible that the changes made to LOS rules since then might not
allow that little targetting trick to work anymore.
