So, for older players to get a better ping and hang out with their
countrymen, you'd rather suggest them to delete their characters 
and destroy their gear they've been spending THOUSANDS of hours on,
just so that people with inferiority complexes (dare I say such as you)
wouldn't have a reason to get jealous?

Level 40-50's aren't killing orcs in EC just to show off, but for 
Freeport faction. There are hundreds of other places you could hunt
for exp, but not for faction. Maybe move your legs a bit, kill some
kodiaks, move to North Ro etc.
