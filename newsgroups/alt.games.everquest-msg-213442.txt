it's done, just not by role players...there is no game mechanic in place for
penalizing druids for killing wolves/bears/bunnies, so long as you aren't in
the plane of growth

yuck

no, the wolf aggro'd the cleric, and the druids assisted the wolf...it
stinks, i know

no, even with great faction, the  druids will jump in and help

yup

only if you healed him or in some other way, got on the aggro list

well, if you port someone who is kos to druids, like a shadowknight, that
person will be attacked upon zoning in....so you need to make sure anyone
who is kos is invis -- or of high enough level to take care of themselves

in your situation, the cleric wasn't kos to druids, just to the wolf, and
that caused the silly chain reaction of the druids jumping in

if you cast invis to animals or camo on your friend, he/she should be able
to hang out with you near the druids without problems, but the aminals
around druid rings will soon stop attacking you (they'll con green soon)
anyway
