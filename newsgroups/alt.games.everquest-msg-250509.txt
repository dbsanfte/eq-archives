What I would like to see is an "easy" setting for soloists, or class-
tailored solo difficulties. As a non-uber battlecleric, I can solo undead 
fairly well, but I will never touch a necromancer or beastlord in 
soloability.

How fun would it be to have an hour long adventure where I did not have to 
heal anyone else and I could AFK guilt-free at whim? A lot.
