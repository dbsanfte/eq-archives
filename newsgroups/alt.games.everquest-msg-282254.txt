I have signed up for the trial version of Everquest and am trying to
get it to run. However, I have a problem where the mouse sticks in the
upper, left-hand corner of the screen when it pulls up the "warning:
may cause seizures" screen.

I have visited the official Everquest forums in search of a solution to
this but have had no luck. They say to download a program from MS (I've
forgottenn the name, now) which will allow you to alter a few settings
and correct the problem but I am running Win 98. The program will only
work in Win 2000 or higher. So, that is not an option for me.

I have tried the alternate fix of switching out mouse drivers but to no
avail. I have also downloaded the newest drivers for my video card
(Sapphire Radeon 9200SE Atlantis) and have the newest DirectX driver
(9.0c).

Does anyone have any other suggestions of what to try? I've only seen a
couple of people on the message boards who are also running 98 and have
this problem, but they have not been answered there.

I appreciate your help!
