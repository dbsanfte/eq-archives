Okay, okay, okay. I'm not one for all the numbers you
guys keep throwing out here. All I know is what happened
*to me*. I'm a level 47 ranger who cast 15 straight
cure diseases on myself and the plague mites were still
there. What does that indicate? I didn't cast it enough?
Or that there was something else there that wasn't being
taken care of by the cure disease?

And write in words of one syllable or less please. I'm
even less able to comprehend things today than usual.
