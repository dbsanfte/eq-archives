Anyone who has been reading this group for a very long time will recall
when EQ was first release, the rumor of a program called "EQTopless" or
something like that, which allowed you to view the characters (wood elf

Well, with the recent release of SoL, some interesting graphics bugs have
popped up...

The only changes from the original screenshots are cropping and converting
from BMPs to JPEGs....no photoshop :)
