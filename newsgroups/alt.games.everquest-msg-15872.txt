It seems to be making the rounds on boards. I found it on my guild's board,
rolled my eyes at the definitions of exploits, skimmed the part on Innoruuk
and Cazic (or would have caught on), began to smell a rat when all of Kael
and Skyshrine could see invis and finally figured it out in the part about
removing Iksar's factions :)

Saddest part of this whole thing is that it *does* take that long to realize
it's a hoax if you're just skimming the message...
