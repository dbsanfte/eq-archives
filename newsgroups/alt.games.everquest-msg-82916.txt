It is a sad world we live in. In all walks of life someone will take some
information and twist it to fit in with their own twisted ideas to justify
their own racist views.

There is only one race on this planet and that is the human race. No one is
born a substandard human being, some are born with genetic defects and
diseases but does not make them any less human.

Mankind is made from the sum of its parts and until some of these parts stop
being so twisted in their views we will not live at peace. No child is born
a religious zealot or a racist. Go to any primary school and all children
play with each other without any regard to each others colour or religious
beliefs. It is people like Marjorie who indoctrinate their children with
ongoing racist hatred. It is relgious zealots who are allowed to
indoctrinate children with religious hatred that in turn keep this hatred
going.

The Terrorists of September 11th and prepetrators of all other atrocious
acts commited around the world in name of religion etc. were not born with
this hatred but were indoctrinated with it by their parents, priests and
other elders.

The Jews are not conspiring against the world nor are the Muslims or any
other religion.

I personally am an Atheist. Not something I was indoctrinated with. I have
learnt all I can about every religion and to sum up every religion follows
the same theme. God is all, we are all created by God and everyone should
treat everyone else as their own equal because we are indeed one large human
family.

It is people like Majorie that makes this world continue to be at war.
