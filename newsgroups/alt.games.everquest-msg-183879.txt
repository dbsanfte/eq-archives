Well, since you weren't having to aim your "shots", nor dodge to make
an opponent's shooting difficult, I am curious as to just what was 
involved other than using mouselook to control your heading while
strafe-running for safety.  I suppose you might have used knowledge
of pathing glitches and the slight slowdown mobs experience traversing
steep slopes (I'll take a 37hp fall over a backshot from a giant any
day).  Anything obvious I'm overlooking?
