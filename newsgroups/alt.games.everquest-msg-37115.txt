Don't bother at level 10. I took my 25 druid there while drinking coffee
this morning, since that's my only character in the "Lake of Ill Omen"
level range, as they were describing it. Got aggroed by green kobolds,
and nasty red tigresses (kajeks I think they are called). Many trains to
zone. It looks like they have designed the zone such that if you are in
the level range for most of it, you better have a pretty strong group.
Some of the 54's and 55's in zone were saying there was stuff still blue
to them. Someone found a quest giving NPC, as well. I did manage to kill
a Jungle Spiritling, which looked like a green wisp. That was about all
I had time for before leaving for work.
