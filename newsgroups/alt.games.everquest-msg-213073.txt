Hehe...I knew there was a reason I had Graeme killfilled from day one.

No offense buddy, but the remark wasn't directed towards you, and had
nothing to do with you. DT is a permanent asshole who offers no
redeeming qualities to the general public. You've been plonked for
just being a lame jackass, while I keep DT out of morbid curiousity as
to how far he can go in the "Clueless Dumbass" catagory. 

If ya don't like my comments, the by all means...*plonk* away. 
Won't hurt my feelings a bit :)
