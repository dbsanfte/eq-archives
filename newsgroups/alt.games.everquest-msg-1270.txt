A druids primary role is to assist.  Sure, they can snare, dot, kite
mobs, but in general druids do the buffing, healing, and later on,
evacing.  In the 30's you can find most druids running around porting
people for money.  In the 40's and so on druids can quad kite mobs -
this is great as they usually train others.  In the 50's druids can be
found farming items so they can switch to a better class.  So what are
you reporting people's names for anyways?  I'd get pissed if some level
9 asswipe reported my 55 warrior for a cool name.  Screw this
roleplaying crap - that's for a bunch of weirdos.  You should know your
place, learn the game, and relax a bit instead of ruining it for other
people.  This game is also founded on relationships, screw them up by
reporting people and you're going to be soloing.
