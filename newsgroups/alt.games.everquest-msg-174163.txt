I think it's equally naive to make the assumption "Bush is an oil man" ==>
"Everything Bush does is for oil profits."  It's the easy connection, but
not necessarily the right one.  It pretty much has the validity of sheer
conjecture.  By that reasoning, even if we had absolute proof that Saddam
was one month away from having a nuclear weapon capable of hitting LA from
Baghdad, many would still say Bush was in it for the oil.
