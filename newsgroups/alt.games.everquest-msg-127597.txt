I fail to see any real difference, spoiler-wise, between the person who
researches a quest on the web, and the person who sends tells in
the game to the effect of, "hi, I'm utterly clueless and lazy to boot,
please spell out for me exactly where I need to go and what I need
to do".

At least the former person has the initiative to go find his own
walkthroughs, pull together information from various sources,
and probably learn a lot of auxiliary information in the process.

I saw nothing in his post that sounded like he was saying
people "had" to get information "outside the game".  His
main point was clearly spelled out, "please make sure you
have done your homework" -- by any means.  He just pointed
out EQ websites as good places to do it, he didn't mandate them.

His objection to the guy sending him questions in tells
wasn't that he hadn't gone to a website, but that he had
just about KS'ed an epic item when he clearly had no clue
what he was doing or what to do with it.  He had just been
dragged there by his guild and his guild had done the
encounter and said "loot this now, you need it."

At least people who visit spoiler sites understand
the flow and narrative of the quest, where they need to go,
why they need it done, and how they need to go about it.
They're also usually capable of being the "general" of
their own epic raids, instead of just tagging along
while the guild does the real work.

>sites is no more entitled to epic pieces than someone

He didn't say they were "more entitled".  His point
was that people who don't know what the heck they're
doing shouldn't lay claim to a rare drop or encounter
until they do know what they're doing, one way or
another.

I'd be annoyed too if someone had barged in and
argued with me over a drop, then asked me,
"so, um, what do I do with this?"

As a separate issue, I see nothing incompatible
about reading EQ information sites and being
"immersed in the game world".  If EQ were a
real world, its inhabitants would have written
books and journals of world histories, tales of 
their experiences and discoveries, bits of 
information and speculation, compilations of
recipes and quests.  And new generations would
browse this amassed knowledge to gain an
education about how the world works and how
to prosper in it.

The EQ world itself does not provide a mechanism
for writing scrolls and books which can be
researched by other players, so websites
stand in their stead.  When I read EQ websites,
I'm still "immersed in the game world", because
I'm reading the dusty faded diaries and
compiled research of those who adventured before me.

...and surely you're not suggesting that people
should all wander the land of Norrath (and Luclin)
talking to all NPCs for clues to quests and
camp every mob in the game to learn what loot
drops might pertain to what NPC quest hints, in
order to figure out quests by themselves and
thus avoid any "spoilers" (whether from EQ sites,
or other players)...

Finally, I find it ironic that you would recoil
in horror at the advice that people might find
internet resources handy when you're clearly
reading THIS INTERNET NEWSGROUP yourself for
information about the game.
