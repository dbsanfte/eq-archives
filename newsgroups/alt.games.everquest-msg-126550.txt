I charm-kited for probably 20 days /played, and as far as I can
figure, a wind instrument has no effect on charm duration, but *may*
have a slight effect on resists.  A wind instrument definately has and
effect with mez songs.
You guys both mention that you are unable to instument switch.  Have
you optimized you set-up for basically mouse-free action?  I've got
everything set up as a hotkey, and I keep the second instrument on my
mouse pointer.  When I need to switch, I just click my mouse button
and go back to twisting.  Takes literally less than a second and I
just incorporate it into my kiting rhythm.  Hmmm, lemme see if I can
replicate it here.

target mob
Selos, pause, pause
stop selos 
charm, pause, pause
stop charm
f8, /pet attack 
f1 f1
selos, pause, pause
stop selos
hymn, pause, swap
stop hymm
selos, pause, swap
stop selos
charm, pause, pause...etc etc.

They lengthened the duration of charm, so it may not work quite that
well now.  I took to twisting charm/selos/hymn/selos/hymn/charm after
the change, but I had my epic shortly after, so I pretty much stopped
swapping instruments.  With the tab buffer trick that I still haven't
figured out, you may be able to simplify the f8, f1, f1 dance I had to
do.
