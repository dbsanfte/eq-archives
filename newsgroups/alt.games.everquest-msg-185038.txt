I'm done playing with you. You're so full of shit it's coming out your
ears, and you're just stupid and/or arrogant enough to think people
are buying it. The only ideas I've seen have gotten mixed results in
response. You're pulling bullshit out of your ass and think you're
somehow better than I am and don't need to back up your fairy tales
with facts like I'm expected to do. Your double-standards are only
showing us all what a hypocrite you really are.

Bye bye. Maybe next time, you can come up with some ploy that doesn't
insult our intelligence.
