I'm skeptical of the practical value of this advice at this stage. When 
grouped with a cleric and pali at these low levels, while hunting some 
poisonous snakes and spiders I had twinked a couple pieces of split paw 
  armour (for +15 poi), plus endure poison (lowbie cleric version), and 
the bards lowbie resist disease/poison song played with a non-magic 
handdrum (for a total poison boost of +60 or 70) and it made almost no 
appreciable difference... we still got poisoned every single fight...

Unless you plan on cranking your resists up over 200 somehow I really 
wonder if theres a point in fussing over it much at this stage. And 
certainly picking out a few +2 or 3 poison newbie items is going to make 
no difference at all.
