God DAMN is that game a mess.

I seriously though EQ was buggy and quit it for AO (don't ask, it'd take me
ages to tell you the whole story about the 3 prostitutes, the nun and the
warrior with a Wurmslayer ;P ) and AO is like a minefield of bugs compared
to EQ.

I'm returning to EQ with my tail between my legs and my head bowed down
begging for forgiveness! EQ is gonna feel like THE most perfect game EVER
after Anarchy Online.

Seriously folks, if anyone here is even thinking of thinking of thinking of
dropping EQ for Anarchy Online I DEFINATELY DONT SUGGEST IT :)

Infact, when Funcom realise their game is so screwed that they'll never fix
it then maybe they'll just animate the sky textures of the game and release
them as a screensaver hehe.

/rant off :)
