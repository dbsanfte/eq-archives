From what I read he aggroed the mob, and then went under the bridge,
knowing the mob would get stuck. According to Verant the mob wanted to
get at TWO people but could not. 

Man, I can think lots of situations where I would like a mobs stuck
somewhere while I set up, this is a huge advantage and very different
from a mob being where Verant put it. Since they were using other
exploits like rez effect I would expect some time moving bodies an
setting that up.

Irrelevant, cheating and loosing, and cheating and winning, are two 
sides of the same coin.
