because part of the fun of building a character is his future.

calling the new game EQ2 pretty much implies that EQ is a dead end, they
should have named it something else if they didn't want to leave that
impression

so I guess they figure we will buy EQ2, build up the characters in that
game just to throw them away when EQ3 comes out?

no, it is Verant that has the wrong mindset, there is a basic motivation
for playing here that they don't seem to understand.
