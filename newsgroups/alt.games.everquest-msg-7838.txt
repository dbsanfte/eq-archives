its your own damn fault for not reading the patch message.

On the other hand it was an incredibly stupid decision on verants part to
make the quests harder . Velious is still very underused for several real
problems . The best armor comes from th kael quests, the easiest comes from
the plane of growth . Both of those choices pit the good race roleplayers
against the powergamers. Much of velious requires more than one group . The
magic resistance of mobs in velious is way out of whack , even if every
spell cast always had full effect the tanks would still way overpower the
casters at 60 .
