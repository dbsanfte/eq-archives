what kind of raids do you want to do?

this is true - but you shouldn't worry, because it isn't too hard to get
your resists to a good spot for most raids

the general rule of thumb is around 100 unbuffed FR/CR or PR/DR ...you'll
rarely, if ever, need all your resists

(also, owning 2 insta-clickable-buff items is usually required)

for starters, level is the most important stat, and resists are second

also, not all raids have AoE damage, so you won't always need resist gear

and speaking of AoE, generally there are two kinds.....fire/cold, and
poison/disease

fire/cold is far more common than poison/disease

getting fire/cold to 100 unbuffed isn't too hard, not for a few kpp


the trick to getting your resists up cheaply is to ignore your other stats,
and basically give them up ... i know you love your wis, but if you drop it
a few points to raise your resists, that's acceptable

most importantly, figure out who you're going to raid with and what their
targets are (are they in velious? HOT? or do they try to down Trak everytime
he's up? knowing your targets will help, plus there's usually a lot of
hand-me-down resist gear floating around, or a jewler who can do BD stuff at
cost, etc.)
