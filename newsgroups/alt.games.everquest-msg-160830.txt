I don't agree completely, though I think they could give new players a
better break on the price of the base game + Kunark.. Afterall, there's a
link to download a free 30 day trial of EQ right on the main web page. After
30 days a potential subscriber will either be hooked and not care so much
about cost or will know that the game isn't for them at that kind of price.
