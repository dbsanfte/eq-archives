How much testing is enough when going "public" increases the number of
testers by a factor of 100s if not 1000s?

I am not saying that they test "enough" or not. I am not qualified to
make that assesment, and I think you should admit the same.

The fact that EQ is still wildly successful indicates that the bugs
introduced with all of the patches/expansions over the years were not
enough to affect the success of the game. I am sure some players have
been driven off by them, but the vast majority ride out the storm and
continue to play. All business lose customers. Successful business
replace the ones lost and acquire new ones. Which is exactly what EQ
has done.

Bugs reported on message boards are not always reported in-game (eq
/bug) When this happens the failure is in the hands of the testers
that do not follow proper procedures. Also bugs have to be
prioritized. If a bug is deemed to be insignificant, then fixing it
may be put off and the patch rolled out as scheduled. An unaddressed
bug is not by default an ignored bug.

I don't think anyone will argue the fact the Sony (formerly Verant)
has rushed changes out the door before fully testing them. As noted
above the game is still doing extremely well despite any poor
planning.

Appearances are deceiving. There is no doubt that Sony has "paid
testers". The only question is whether or not they can duplicate the
load and ingenuity of hundreds of thousands of players beating on the
code. Again...how many is enough? At what point does cost and overhead
make it impossible to add more testers? That is how business works.
However many (or few) paid testers Sony has, the popularity of the
game dictates that no immediate changes are necessary.

The depth and quantity of the content in EQ is amazing. No other game
even comes close. Is quantity better than quality? I don't know the
answer to that, but the success of EQ seems to indicate that the
"quality" of the current content is good enough to keep people
playing.
