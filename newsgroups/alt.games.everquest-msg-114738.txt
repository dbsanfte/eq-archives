   As others have told you, it is worth the pain of starting
a new character to be on FV.  If you really want to
roleplay, you will love it there.  The fact that there is
only one character allowed makes this a wonderful server,
IMHO.  It's much easier to get into a character when it's
the only character you'll have, at least on that server. 
The new changes, again, IMHO, have made this server
playable.  It is possible to learn languages quickly, and
one can turn off /role and do zone wide /shouts, which makes
communication and therefore grouping much easier.
   Give it a shot.  I doubt that you will regret it.
