>Variety of reasons for feeling discontented with EQ

The big problem with your argument is that you have not made it to high
enough levels with any of your characters to really begint to experience the
real fun of EQ.  It's kind of like leaving a movie when all you've seen is
the opening credits.

At lower levels there isn't that much difference in game play of various
classes.  Everyone jumps on a MOB, hits attack and waits for something to
die.  At around the high teens to mid 20's things start to change as each
class gets better spells and abilities that define it.  In fact some classes
don't really become powerful until they hit 50+.

Same thing for interaction.  At low levels you won't group a lot. When you
get into the mid-range levels grouping and exploring dungeons is a lot of
fun.  At this stage you will need several people to survive in some places
and need the various skills and abilites of other classes to do well.  You
will see how much fun it is to successfully survive a "bad pull" or take
down a tough MOB when everyone works together.  That goes well beyond just
chatting and is something you could never do on ICQ.

Same for content. At Lower levels you are limited to the zones you can
explore and the type of EQ experience available to you.  As you level, you
can travel to other zones, explore, complete quests, take up a tradeskill
attend raids, etc... Actually, you will not find a more complex in-depth
game anywhere.  Many people have played this game since it began and they
still admit that there are many things they don't know about the game. The
game content changes often, new items, quests, skills etc...  are added,
there are thousands of quests, tens of thousands of items, 100+ zones to
explore etc....   It literally takes people years to say "well I've seen
everything and I'm bored with EQ"  At the levels you have acheived you have
not even begun to get to the interesting parts.  At level 12 (your highest)
you are still hanging out in the newbie zones, admittedly very boring stuff.


And last but not least, lag in the Bazaar is legendary and not
representative of the game as a whole.  There are tricks to getting around
in the bazaar if you really want to.  Some zones are more laggy than others
and some are more laggy sometimes than others.  There are plenty of places
that play fine, even with older computers (my son plays on a 400).  So most
people just avoid the zones that lag for them.

As for monthy fee, if you play as much as some people it calculates out to
very cheap entertainment.  I am a casual player at about 20-25 hours per
week.  At that rate, my hourly entertainment cost is .12-.16 cents per hour.
Not bad in my book.

The bottom line is that you have not played the game to a level where you
can really evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of it.  I won't try to
convince you to keep playing, that's up to you. I just don't want to leave
the impression for anyone else stopping in that your evaluation of the game,
based on a few weeks of low level play, is valid.
