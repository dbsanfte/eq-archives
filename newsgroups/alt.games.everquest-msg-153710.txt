At 47 my monk (who is decently equipped, AC around 900 or so, HP around 
1200ish IIRC) can keep tanking most mobs with a cleric at his back 
indefinitely. And that is with nonstop chain pulling. 

Between blocks and dodges and ripostes, I keep aggro well. The only time I 
lose aggro is unintelligent groupmates (healing the puller on the way in, 
getting too close while meleeing, casting Snare 5 times in a row when it is 
getting resisted...)
