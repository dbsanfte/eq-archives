         If you are going ld or dropping to desktop alot with MSN it is
because there is a "bug" in MSN that overides the idle setting in windows.
     I used MSN and was getting dropped every 45min to an hour and had a msg
saying "click to stay online" (similar to AOL).
    I called MSN tech support and they denied using a timer. They said
adjust the idle timer in windows, and mine was already set to "never
disconnect when idle".  I still kept getting kicked and seeing a "click to
stay online " button.  I finally got sick of it and cancelled MSN.  The
customer service rep for MSN I spoke to when cancelling asked why I was
cancelling, I told her, and she said  there was a bug in MSN that caused
that.  Now why does a customer service rep know about this "bug"  but a tech
support person doesn't?
