DAoC's amount of PvE content appeared smaller than it was, because of
geography.  Most areas there are big squares, whereas EQ had a lot of
narrow, long zones.  Take West Commons, for instance.  That is a very small
zone, but because of the way it is laid out, it seems much bigger than it
is, especially at low levels.

The zoning also added to the illusion of size.

Here are the relative sizes of various Antonica outdoor zones, in an
arbitrary scale:

    48.1    South Karana
    22.5    North Karana
    15.0    East Karana
    51.6    West Karana
     7.2    Qeynos Hills
    17.1    Everfrost
    10.0    Lake Rathetear
    16.9    Rathe Mountains
    11.3    The Feerott
     7.3    Innothule Swamp
     7.2    Southern Desert of Ro
     7.3    Oasis of Marr
     8.3    Northern Desert of Ro
     9.4    East Commonlands
     7.8    Nektulos Forest
     7.5    West Commonlands
    10.9    Kithicor Forest
     4.7    Lavastorm Mountains
     5.6    Misty Thicket

In this scale, a DAoC region, like Salisbury Plains, would be about 60 units
of area.

Adding up everything, the reachable area in DAoC before Shrouded Isles
(e.g., one realm's home area plus three frontiers) was somewhere between EQ
1 pre-Kunark and EQ 1 with Kunark.  Shrouded Isles added area to each realm
comparable to its existing home region, and Trials of Atlantis made a
comparable expansion, so DAoC has a lot of PvE area now.

I often find in DAoC, when I run through a low level zone with a high level
character, not caring about the route because nothing there can touch me, so
I don't pay attention, and end up going off in some random direction...I
find plenty of great camps that I never new were there when I was XPing in
that zone.

(This also happens in EQ...I installed ShowEQ once and just ported around
with my Wizard, looking at the mob distribution, and was *amazed* at how
much stuff is out there off the beaten path.  People would be fighting over
three or four camp spots in Frontier Mountains, when the West side of the
zone was *crawling* with things they could have hunted, for example).
