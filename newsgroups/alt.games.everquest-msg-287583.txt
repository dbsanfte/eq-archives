Please take 10-15 mnutes of your time to be an anonymous participant
in a research project that I am performing for school. You will be
asked to answer a series of question and view up to 4 short video
clips upon which some of the questions are based.
    The research involves the level of appreciation that people have
for animals, and what effects different television programs might have
on that relationship. Your opinion would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
