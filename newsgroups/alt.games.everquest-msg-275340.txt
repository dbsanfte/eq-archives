It's my understanding (and I could be wrong) that the experience debt
from a death is simply shared between all members of the group (i.e.
the amount of debt is not increased before the share).  If this is the
case and you get a complete group wipe then you get no more experience
debt than if you'd died without the shared debt code.  So, your problem
here is not the shared experience debt but the fact that you died a
number of times in quick succession.  The only time you suffer from the
shared experience debt is when you don't die but one or more of your
group dies.
