The book with the recipe is the rare drop that I believe was being 
referred to.

I'd imagine the book likely says something about Seru being impervious and 
needing a special weapon.

Not that it would need to.  The type of player that finds this is the kind 
that follows up on everything if they are able.  Once someone tries it and 
makes one of the weapons, and it says right there on the stats: Bane: 
Seru: +whatever it's not too far of a leap to see this is needed to fight 
Seru himself.
