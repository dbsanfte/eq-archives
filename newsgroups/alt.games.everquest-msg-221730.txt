   Agreement here.  The whole "I'm a rare beautiful diamond so pay me more" crap
is never going to be tolerated on any server for any length of time.  On the
other hand, the "the cleric eats the cost of the dots, save for the rare few
that may drop" attitude is also just as unfair.  

    I'm just waiting for the patch that makes all buffs component free and have
done with it.
