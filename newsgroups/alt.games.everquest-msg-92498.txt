Damn, I'm really not sure how to respond to such stunning intellect.  I 
didn't ask which side of the road you drove on, I asked how you decide 
which side to drive on.  It's obvious that you're a moron, so I'll 
clarify.
You do realize that the majority of EQ players are from countries that 
drive on the right, correct?  You are also aware that when people from 
England take the Chunnel to France, they drive on the right when they're 
in France, correct?  Why do they do this?  Several reasons, but mostly 
because it's the accepted thing to do.  It makes it possible for traffic 
to flow, and prevents tens of thousands of accidents each day.  This is a 
good thing.  Driving on the right or left in and of itself is not the good 
thing, but the fact that in certain geographic regions there is a clear, 
accepted, and rigorously followed standard.

I never said anything about the American way, but I'm pretty damn sure 
that Portand, Maine is in the US.  So you're a troll.  

To respond to your poor excuse for an arguement....No, I only think that 
in situations in which you are forced to interact with others, following 
generally accepted consensus is the correct and prudent course of action.  
For whatever reason on the VAST majority of EQ servers the accepted course 
of action is to train right and med left.

Now I'm just astounded.  This is where I ask for some of whatever it is 
that you are smoking, I wanna hallucinate too.  The discussion is about 
training in KC.  This implies that there is someone to be bothered by the 
train and that they are bothered by the train.  This requires that there 
be someone else in the zone, that they are affected by the train, and that 
the train ended up somewhere unexpected for whatever reason.  If you're 
the only person or only group in the zone, this isn't an issue.  
I never said anything about dissing anyone in shout or ooc.  The only 
reference I made to shout/ooc is 'train right please' which is about as 
polite as ANYONE could expect to be.  
I currently play US primetine.  At various periods I have played Asian 
primetime and European primetime.  I have been the only person in KC, and 
the only group in KC.  In fact, I was once the only non-Asian in my group, 
in the only group in KC, and we still ran out to the right, without any 
conscious discussion or thought.
Hell, when I was soloing CoM/EJ for several levels, I was the only person 
in 4 zones most of the time, yet I still ALWAYS trained right for the 
exact same reason that I always drive on the same side of the road as 
everyone else in whichever country I'm in.
Now I'm going to politely ask you to go slam your head in a car door, 50 
or 60 times.  Please.
