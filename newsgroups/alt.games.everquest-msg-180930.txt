Yup. While spamming may win some companies some customers, I'd wager
it LOSES them a whole lot more. I have never met anyone who has ever
been prompted to buy anything due to spam to a newsgroup or in email,
and, in fact, most people I know go as far as to never deal with the
company who spams.

The same holds true for most "blind dial" telemarketting.
