 I went into the new PoHate and zoned in by the well. My Sneak  and
Hide was maxed at my current lvl of 52. On the bridge thing there was
a scorn banshee and an ire ghast. I forget the other two but I was
told these saw through sneak/hide but I wanted the book. They conned
scowling but I managed to sneak past both by hugging the wall across
from them. They never agro'd. Nor did any other mobs including the one
by the book of souls. I like to think I was that good but it was
probally a glitch.
