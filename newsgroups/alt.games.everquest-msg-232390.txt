My Wife & I have been killing Tsetsian flies on the islands by the GY
in Plane of Disease and found they give pretty good exp and are not
too tough. You just have to be careful of Rats & Larvae as they are
quite a bit tougher. I have seen several Bards kiting there so it may
be a good place to quad kite - I have never quadded with my Druid so I
don't know much about it.
