Because the UN doesn't carry much weight in the US, and especially because
it was due to the UN that we didn't finish the job the first time around.

In his shoes, he's got four years to act.  The timing may not be good, but
the timing for him wasn't going to ever be better.

Answered in the previous paragraph.  You can ask the question as many times
as you'd like, the answer won't change, and the answer is a legitimate
answer even if you don't agree with it.  That would place you into the "the
UN doesn't carry much weight in the US" crowd.  I'm right there with you.  I
think the UN is a farce.

But you don't let the termites keep at it without doing something about it
either.  I love analogies.  =)

Those aren't accomplishments, they're statistics.  The one accomplishment
listed, the Family and Medical Leave Act, could have been decent.  Until the
Clinton administration tried to push the states into covering lost income
under unemployment insurance in spite of the fact that by virtue of being
covered by the FMLA, the recipients were obviously employed.  So in addition
to hurting businesses (and there is no dispute that it hurts businesses), it
also attempted to take money out of the hands of the unemployed to provide
government-paid vacations (thankfully nixed...  by Bush).  So while the
actual act itself still isn't bad, it will forever be tainted to a large
number of people by this example of "back door" politics.

Medicaid already exists for low income families.  With proper reforms,
Medicare could be reined in to a workable program, and the entire health
system would follow suit (just as it has ballooned to follow suit as
Medicare ballooned).  With the health care system reined in so that it isn't
outpacing inflation at its current bajillion to one rate, insurance rates
would stop inflating at their current bajillion to one rate.  With insurance
rates affordable, more people would receive insurance through their
employers, or could pay for it themselves.

But why bother with logic?  Instead of reforming Medicare and bringing the
whole health care system back to reality, we can expand Medicare to cover
everyone and just let the government pay for it all.  But as you have
pointed out, *I* am the one that ends up paying for it.

Are you a closet bible thumper?  You seem to comment on Bush's religious
beliefs often.  I'm not sure I've heard Bush even mention his religious
beliefs in more than a very passing manner.  God bless the USA and all that
jazz.

Actually, I give as much if not more credit to Gorbachev, who really ushered
in a "kinder and gentler" era in Russian politics.
