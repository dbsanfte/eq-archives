Dang it, it took a little nerve, I think, to start in soloing Tizmaks at
25, and I'm quite dissapointed to discover that their armor doesn't fit
me.

Is there anywhere out there where -halfling- druid wearable junk armor
drops off an outdoor mob ranging from 26 to30?  I have no patience with
killing blues, and I'm incapable of soloing anything over 5 levels
higher than myself.

Barring that, how about relatively plentiful drops like the Tizmak that
my 52 cleric can
go get off blue mobs with a partner or two (soloing, while possible,
isn't an efficient
thing to do in terms of mobs per hour, as a cleric.  Heck, I couldn't
even solo enough
tizmaks to get a peek at their armor in good time!)
