     I have this same problem with an ATI Rage 128.  I also had the
game start locking up on me anywhere from immediately to 5 minutes
(five MINUTES) into the game.  Hard freeze, needed rebooting to fix.
I tried multiple versions of my video drivers and none behaved
differently.  I tried a patch for a known obscure problem with my
motherboard chipset...it fixed a minor sound problem but not the
lockups.  I expanded my C: partition and got my maximum game time
up to about an hour and a half, but it still always locks up eventually
and sometimes still does it within one minute of playing.

     A friend of mine has the exact same problem with an ATI board
in a laptop.

     Bottom line:  It's apparently the result of poor interaction
between the ATI drivers and DirectX 8.1.  Despite the fact that EQ is
the only program in the entire world that triggers it, Verant likely
does not view it as *their* bug and will not be fixing it...especially
since the ATI Rage 128 is now among their official list of UNsupported
video cards.
