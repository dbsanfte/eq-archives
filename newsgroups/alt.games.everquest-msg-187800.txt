I had my druid there from 34th to 43rd quadding Ulthorks and Walruses along
the shore. You can mix the ulthorks and walruses, since they seem to move at
the same speed, more or less. And, if you get bored with it or there are
none up, there are the giants at the prison. I was able to get to dubious on
my CoV faction by killing the Ogre Mercs that are there. Just be careful
with them. They have a good many hit points, and there will be a captain
that will pop on occasion that is even tougher.

To top it off, you can get decent money there, since the ulthorks drop
weapons and armor on occasion and by turning in 4 tusks at a time to the
Othmir chief, you can get some decent money with the gems and jewelry items
he gives as a reward (got a blue diamond my first turn in).
