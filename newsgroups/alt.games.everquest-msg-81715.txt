Just had a group in DL last night with a Beasty... As an enchanter of the 44
season I was very annoyed that he 1) wasn't controlling his pet and then 2)
said he couldn't control his pet... As of the fact that he was busy
tanking...  I can understand to a certain extent... but dam... if you can't
control your pet when tanking get rid of the dam pet

/rant off

Are there Beast Lords who can tank and control pets successfully? Never
played pet controling class myself. What kind of hints and suggestions can I
give the next time I have this problem? or is it going to have to be one of
those 'me or him' situations? I don't mind the idea of pet classes in
group... but when it's messin with my ability to do my job... :) thanks for
any suggestions in advance
