Kane Bayle has always been a very low population server, which means
it's much much more vulnerable to a relatively small number of players
leaving than the older high population servers are.  I think very few
servers are at risk - Kane Bayle, maybe Maelin Starpyre, the Zeks, the
UBISoft servers, possibly a couple of other small servers.  I suspect
maintenance costs are low enough they'll be kept up, though.

Of course if WoW or EQ2 manage to suck out large portions of the
player base things may be different, but I don't think they'll have
that big an impact.
