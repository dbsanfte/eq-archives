"On the other hand, I'm never jealous of those that have better that me, as
I have
inspect turned off, as well as inspect notification. I could care less who
looks at my gear, and I have no interest in what others are using."

annoy some people while the rest are like us and just do away with it
altogether, inspector or inspectee.
