England got the shite kicked out of them did they? oh that must have been while
we owned half the globe and half of world trade. I believe the romans were the
only people to succesfully invade Britain, bearing in mind this country has
fought more wars than any other, and the english language derives from an
obscure germanic tribe who settled on the isles. Us brits share direct lineage
with germans.
