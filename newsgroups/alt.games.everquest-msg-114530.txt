Incidentally, this would be pretty close to my definition of a "loot
whore": someone whose sole purpose in going on raids is to have a
chance to get something for themself. Also, the assumption that
callout loot is 'thinly veiled favoritism' is a sure sign that someone
clearly doesn't get understand things like team building or delayed
gratification.

Take a look at what callout guilds are accomplishing in the game as
opposed to guilds that use random roll. On Torv, at least, the
appearance of magic dice on a raid is a sure sign of diletantism.
