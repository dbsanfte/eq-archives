Ah, who the hell cares, guys are useless anyway, children should be grown in
labs and raised by the government. I guess God is taking today off from
plagues today as it is Sunday. I'm going to play Everquest now.

I kind of liked this song from last night. I might end up dead on the bottom
of a river with a ridiculous maniacal grin on my face if I listen to songs
like this. Ah I know a good one that I'll post next, not really good but
just kind of good.

"No One Knows"

We get some rules to follow
That and this
These and those
No one knows

We get these pills to swallow
How they stick
In your throat
Tastes like gold

Oh, what you do to me
No one knows

And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool of mine
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool of mine
Ahh

I journey through the desert
Of the mind
With no hope
I found low

I drift along the ocean
Dead lifeboats in the sun
And come undone

Pleasently caving in
I come undone

And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool of mine
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool and mine
Ahhh

Heaven smiles above me
What a gift there below
But no one knows

A gift that you give to me
No one knows
