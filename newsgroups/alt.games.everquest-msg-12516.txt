Nope, level is the one and only thing that matters to /con.  Not armor, not
different skill levels with different weapons, not different classes, not
different races.  It's only based on level.

If your 9th level warrior /cons an_orc_candystriper_02 as yellow and your
third cousin has a 9th level druid on a different server with a really ph4t
scimitar and he /conned an_orc_candystriper_02 as blue, it's because his
orc was lower level than yours, nothing more, nothing less.
