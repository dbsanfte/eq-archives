I suppose I should be more specific.  Where would I find visible Chest
items that are wearable by a Magician?  I know about the Cultural armor.  I
plan to try to make it eventually, but each piece can take litterally days
of camping to get the parts for the temper, and the tunic could easily cost
1000pp per attempt.  And that's not counting bribes to get an Enchanter to
help enchant the metal.  I know about the ice goblin skin in Permafrost,
but I just spent several hours butchering goblins and never found one. 
Either I'm looking in the wrong area, or on the wrong goblins.  In any
case, are there any *other* items I could find?  They don't have to be
great for stats, and I'm not picky about whether it looks like chain or
leather, I just want something besides a robe to wear once in a while.
