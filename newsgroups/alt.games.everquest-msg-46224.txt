I realize FEMA is an acronym.. Why do you feel compelled with every
statement you make to tell people you are superior? Becuase you live in New
York? Bow down to Bryan, the poster child for the events of the 11th... Give

Everything you post clearly admits that. Stop spreading doom.

FEMA is clueless. They are well behind the times. That was a major point *I*
made. Jeez what's wrong with you?
