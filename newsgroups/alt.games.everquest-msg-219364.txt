EVERY class has a dumb-ass factor tho:
Monk last night kept running in with the mob then feigning death on top of the
chanter!
Warrior who insists on "off tanking" when there's a mezzer because it's
*faster*??? Huh???  It's not faster when the cleric is always OOM from having
to heal *backup tanks* and all the casters trying to avoid agro because neither
*tank* can keep agro.
Cleric who cast AOE spell with a BOX in the room, (yeah, that was me.  Who'd a
thunk a group heal would cause it to explode????).  
Etcetera yada yada yada
