    It is people. I specifically had to correct myself for that - account is
higher.

    You're right on track with that.

    Yes, two hundred people per server in AoW-capable guilds if we extend
it.

    Now look at my "hypothetical" wizard. His guild can't take down the
Avatar of War. I didn't even assume they could kill Cazic Thule, or do NToV.
How many more people does that bring into the equation? And even if we don't
bring that many people into things - you're looking at 8000 people being hit
with this across all servers. That's a pretty big number, no?

    Please. Comparing overall numbers, which are inflated by stuff like the
200-odd Bazaar mules per server? I like to think of it more like this:
average server population runs 2500 people or under (hitting 100 K was a big
thing, so under). Of these people, the catass power gamers make up 5 to 10%
at any one time. That's significant. And they care about it.

    For reference: I believe only one wizard in my guild was OVER the cap. A
ton of people were within a stone's throw of it, though.

    Calling a dwarf thin? GRRRRR! Stout and proud of it!! *stamps feet*
