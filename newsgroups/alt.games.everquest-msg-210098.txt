Yeah!  Or a Lamborghini with my 0 bucks.


Seriously, you folks (not you Spike) who complained need to get a grip.
This service is provided free of charge to the vast majority of folks and
the Premium Service folks are only parting with $12.00US a year.  My God,
what do you expect?  Every site on the Internet is destined for trouble at
some point and Magelo is no different.

By the way, I do not work for Magelo nor am I a member of their community;
however, I hate to see someone maligned because unrealistic demands were not
met.

If you website at work goes down should "you" be fired?  Immediately?  After
all, they are paying you.
