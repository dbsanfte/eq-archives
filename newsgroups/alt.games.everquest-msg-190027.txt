I have just added a second PC at home, and networked them together.
They will share a cable modem for online activity. I want to have the
new, better, system as my main EQ box. My install history on the old
system is as follows:

EQ Trilogy
EQ Gold (for Luclin and PoP)
Legacy of Ykesha

So there are at least 2 CD keys involved to get to this level, plus
the LoY stuff, which I never had to enter a CD key for as it was all
done online and automatically by EQ. What do I need to do to set all
this up on the new system? I also want to have EQ on the old system.
Do I need to make more purchases of anything? Since EQ Gold includes
Original, Kunark, and Velious I have at least 2 CD keys for those
modules, I believe.

The ultimate goal is to be able to have both systems playing EQ at the
same time. However, I also want to preserve my logs and UI settings.
Where do I go from here?

Thanks in advance for any guidance.

Jeff George

P.S. On an unrelated note, how do I get my UI, hotkey settings, etc.
replicated to a new character? Sorry for so many questions but I want
to get this new system up and questing!
