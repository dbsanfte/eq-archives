Gotta disagree there. If you're out and about the streets just fighting 
random bad guys, you better have quick kill power. As a controller, I 
have to work to take all the mobs in a group down, and I would say that 
during prime time on average 10-20% of my fights involve a KS - usually 
after I've spent all the time locking them all down and whittling them 
down near death.

No argument there. Aside from the KS aspect (it *is* a problem), the game 
is just plain fun.

Actually, I find the combat system very similar to EQ in concept. Each 
power has an attribute cost and a "recast" timer. Beyond that, it's 
basically somewhat strategic button mashing.

Yup. Haven't played EQ at all since I picked up CoH. These graphics are 
incredible, especially on a top-notch video card.
