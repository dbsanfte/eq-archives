There's a momentary lag I get sometimes when pulling a mob, my system 
seems to freeze up for some fraction of a second, which doesn't sound 
like much but in close quarters can be the difference between cleanly 
leading the mob back to my kill spot and being caught, hit, stunned, and 
possibly even killed.

Reading around on the web a couple days ago during a patch, I found a 
note suggesting that this behavior is due to the in game Journal, which 
apparantly keeps track of everything NPC's say... which includes the 
messages they emote when they aggro on me.

Turned this off after some hunting around in the options button 
(couldn't figure out a keyboard command for it, although its probably 
out there) and it does seem to have eliminated this bit of lag.

EQ button, Quests, NPC Journal, click off the enable journal button
