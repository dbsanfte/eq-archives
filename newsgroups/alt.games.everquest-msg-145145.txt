   I hate buff beggars, as much as the materialistic type.  If I feel I
need a particular buff, I will offer to trade or pay for it.  Your mana
isn't there for my use, it's for you and your groups.

> You tell soandso "erm... I am killing deep in NToV"

No no no.  Too wordy.  If someone asks me for anything I don't
particularly feel like giving, the answer is a short, sweet and to the
point "No".  So far, this often gets accepted with no further banter. 
If they do shoot back a "Why not?", as simple shift-up arrow, repeated
as often as is called for, will work.  Sooner or later.  Usually sooner.
   Because if you get at all wordy, you are bound to strike up an
irritating conversation pretty often.
 
> Soandso tells you "so? you can gate here and cast it on me"

  Indeed.  Stupid.  Ignorant.  Very self centered.  But you were the one
that let them know you were open for conversation. 

> ..... /ignore soandso.

My method lets you save your /ignore slots for true jerks, not just
annoying beggars.

Unnecessary, if you consistently use the "/r No." method.

     WOW!  You really think that Verant is going to listen to you, or
any of us?  Wow.  You just gotta respect that level of optimism.

Annie <--- Not in an optimistic mood right now.
