Enchanters aren't all that good at solo PvP, but are *extremely* useful
when grouped with almost any other class.

Also, anyone can self-dot themselves by using a Crimson Potion (bought
at the potion vendor in almost any city). It gives a 50hp boost and
slowly ticks it off over several minutes, hence the dot effect. It has
no cast time. All my chars keep one, as soon as I get tash'd I activate
it, so unless a chanter manages to mez me out of nowhere against my
115mr, its a bit hard.

Overall, enchanters are easy for someone wearing gear to overcome solo,
but an enchanter grouped with another class (esp. a wizard) is very
potent indeed. Imo that is :p
