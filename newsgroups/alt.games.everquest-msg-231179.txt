Well didnt post this to win a popularity contest just giving one view
of the game that no one else was expressing. But I will address what I
think is misrepresented in the above replys without attacking anyone
personally. Cept maybe SoE and they got it coming :)

First as concerns expansions,  they are designed to foster the strong
impression if not the reality that you cant play this game without
them. And please lets not mention the constant bugging EVERY TIME YOU
LOG IN, sheesh thats ethical? Ive seen expansions on other games where
it really wont matter much if you get the upgrade or not, EQ is not in
this group. also many features that should be at no cost only come in
the expansions, shared bank slots things like that, course the plat
dupe bug was free I guess. Yes its a biz and needs to make money but
so is a drug dealer so please find another argument. True SoE makes
more on the monthly charges than the expansion but those revenues are
not trivial. even if half the accounts upgrade thats a cool 40M or so
in the bag. Large motivation to continue coming up with them. 

As for customer service, well there just isnt any in EQ as IMHO define
it. God forbid you have a real need for it, prob take a long time to
get serviced. Now in the 2 other games Ive played since leaving EQ I
received in game help within 10 minutes, and a lost item restored due
to a bug in 1 hour. Only twice but it made my day after playing CS
roulette in EQ where its more than likely to take days and in case of
a lost item perhaps never. 

Anyway there it is the opposing viewpoint...
