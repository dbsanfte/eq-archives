Not sure if it is the same one the other was talking about but I use EQW,
not sure where I downloaded it from now - was in a post on
rec.games.computers.everquest newsite.  But that was a couple of months ago.
But I would like to warn you that using ANY third party software is against
Verant's terms, and although I use it I would not recommend using it for
playing two characters at once, as that IMO is cheating.  I only use it so I
can run other applications such as CD player/Outlook Express etc at the same
time.  (Don't even have two accounts anyway, nor could my current comp be
running EQ twice over at once :-) ).  But I am not sure that EQW will let
you run two at once anyway?
