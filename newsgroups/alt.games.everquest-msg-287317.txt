It's really not a very deep division. I would say my class has about
80% the abilities of its opposite. At least, that's an approximation -
I don't know the other classes well enough. I'm pretty sure for Pally/
SK it might be more like 40%, and for Templar/Inquisitor (cleric) it
might be closer to 90%. Oh - for Monk/Bruiser, for lvls 1-50 the
difference is about 4 skills in the lineup of dozens (50+ i don't know
if they're further divergent).

But most importantly, there is no alienation other than newbie zones.
You don't want to enter an enemy city unless you have the resources to
survive there, but anything you can't have is a clone of what you
already have in your own city. Most "action" quests are centered
around combat zones, which are nondiscriminatory (race-wise). My
girlfriend plays only evil characters (should i be reading into that?)
and i've been meeting her in the lvl 5+ areas (1-5 is too close to
guards) or higher and we'll do common quests together (dungeon
exploration, etc).

A very interesting wrinkle is that at the outskirts of every major
city there is a small camp somewhere with representatives of that
city's enemies. Outside kelethin is a tent with darkelves, tucked away
under a huge fungus. That enemy camp offers a betrayal quest where the
player can sabotage a part of the city or assassinate a public figure
and shred their present class to receive the opposite. I'm pretty sure
it can only be done once, and i think the difficulty of the task is
related to the level the player is when accepting the quest (such that
most people do the quest before 20th level). Betraying strips all
skills/spells; they don't convert. I don't know the details, but i
hear it's worth experiencing at least once.
