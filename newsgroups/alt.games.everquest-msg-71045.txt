From a non-EQ point of view, Win2k is *hugely* more stable and
reliable in general. Under Win98 I was regularly rebooting at least
once a day. Under Win2k, I go weeks without rebooting. And, Win2k runs
faster than Win98. Visibly faster.

Where EQ is concerned, though, you're going to kill your sound by
upgrading to Win2k, especially with that sound card.

If Win98 is working for you, and you have no compelling reasons to
upgrade to Win2k, then stick with 98.
