Uhmn?

ok... maybe you want to add "item" after the word charge... I've never
heard of a spell that has charges and is caster only, but hey, thats
the only possible misinterpretation I can see here.

I meant, rather, that non casters would be able to gate back to their
"home" with a degree of expense or time invested, include some incentives
to encourage people to *use* their homes, try and build literal localised
communities attached to cities.
