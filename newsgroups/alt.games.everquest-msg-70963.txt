Jboots should be easy enough with a 48 cleric as far as killing the AC goes,
but the SRo camp is a long and tedious one. You also run the risk of being
KS'd if/when the AC finally does spawn. Unfortunately, a 48 cleric probably
couldn't camp the AC spawn in OOT (which is always camped anyway) - Seafury
Cyclops are rather tough.

Staff of the Wheel, you'll need underwater breathing of some kind for a few
of the items (Erud's, Lake Rathe, probably Everfrost). Be prepared to die a
few times as well - the killer sharks in Erud's will mince both of you
pretty easy if they spot you. The toughest bit is usually LGuk, but since
you have a cleric to ItU you, you may be okay. Since you can't group port
yet, it may take you a while to get everywhere on foot. The staff is well
worth it though, I still use it at L54 as I haven't got anything better yet
:).
