Yikes... I heartily agree with him here. :) Alpha Centauri was 'best in 
class'  for its Diplomacy engine... I won several games because I knew 
how to turn my opponents against eachother... and loved it because it 
wasn't some goofy trick... it made perfect sense.

MoM was another brilliant title that suffered primarily from being too 
easy. And both MoO and MoO2 are classics, although I haven't tried the 
3rd installment.

Too bad DT plonked me this week... but, for the rest of the group, he's 
right on the money here.
