up untill today i had been using the testeverquest.exe patcher to access
normal Eq servers. just becuase it looks good. after today i got
"testeverquest.exe is no longer valid. Run Everquest.exe"
i did, it patched then said
"please restart the patch program"
i did and it worked let me in, and im still using the new patch interface
but using everquest.exe
make sure you run EVERQUEST.EXE it will now run the new patch interface
