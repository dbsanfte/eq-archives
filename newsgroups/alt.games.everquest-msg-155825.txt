From the patch message:

- In the original patch yesterday morning, /SHIELD was added as an innate 
ability that all Warriors now gain at level 35. Warriors may now choose to 
take a portion of melee damage that is intended for another. Warriors, 
please type /SHIELD for a full description of this ability. You may find 
that it assists you greatly in your groups. 

Correspondingly, NPCs and Pets over level 30 who are Warriors were granted 
this ability as well. Certain NPCs and Pets may choose to protect beings 
that they have an affinity for, if they believe that it will benefit the 
shielded being. For now, however, there is not yet a way to manually cause 
or prevent this behavior in pets. 
---

So, do you guys think the mobs will start /shielding their casters? This, 
combined with the caster "balancing" could make gropups of melee and 
casters VERY difficult.

Especially if you have no chanter and your cleric gets aggro from the 
caster behind the two melees... How do you smack him enough to get aggro 
back?
