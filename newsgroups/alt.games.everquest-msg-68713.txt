Hey there.
Ok, I've used up my level 20 words and some practice points to max out
my research skill, but thus far I've only found a limited quantity of
words for my new lvl 24 necro spells. The only one of the research only
spells I have made is Intensify Death. I don't have all the words for
any others. I'm willing to take my trusty old 51 Warrior and slaughter
greens for a while to get them, but I wanted to ask... what mobs/zones
would be the best bet to get all these words. At a minimum, I *have* to
get my 24 pet spell before I move on to my next hunting grounds, and I'd
really like to have all of them. Any of you elder types recall a place
where you found a lot of words for the 24 level spells?
