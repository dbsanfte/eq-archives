Killing reds is fun, particularly soloable ones.

Wrong, see below.

For levels 1 through 10, you can group with anyone that is within 5 
levels of you.  For higher levels, you must be 2/3rds the level of the 
highest person in the group.  This is almost the same as saying 1.5 times 
your level, but not quite, as with rounding, the latter would preclude 
some level groupings that do actually work.
