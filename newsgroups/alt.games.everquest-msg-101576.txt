I'm a bit confused by what you are asking.

I think that you want to do more damage with weapons ?
Or perhaps hit more often with weapons ?
Or have more hit points ?

To do more damage : 
1) Buy better weapons (Higher damage)
2) level up
3) Stats make almost no difference to the amount of damage you do
To hit more often :
1) Buy better weapons (Lower delay)
2) Train in you weapon skills (e.g. 1 hand bash, 1 hand slash etc.)
3) Level up
4) Stats make almost no difference (directly) to how often you hit
To have more hit points :
1) Get + hit point items
2) Get + Stamina items
3) Level up
4) Stamina = Hit points (kinda)

Generally however Druids don't do much hand to hand fighting after level
20 or so.
So you should not need to worry too much about any of these.

For more help :
Tell us what level you are.
Tell us what you offence and defence skills are
Tell us what your weapon skill levels are
Tell us what weapon(s) you are using
Tell us howm any hit points you have.

HTH,

Jim
