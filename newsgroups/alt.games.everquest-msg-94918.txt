First and foremost, reboot. It won't help, of course, but it's A Good
Idea, and a standard practice in any troubleshooting session.

Second, make sure the CD is clean. CD drives are remarkably good at
reading dirty CDs, but the tiniest speck in the wrong spot can cause
all kinds of trouble. When cleaning the CD, use a soft cloth, like
t-shirt material, and wipe from the center of the disk to the outer
edge. Do not wipe in circles around the disk.

Finally, make sure the CD drive laser head is clean. This is harder
since you can't really get to it. If you've got a very light touch,
you can use some of the canned air that most computer stores sell.
Blow too hard, though, and you can make things worse. Better is to get
one of those 'cleaning' CDs. The one I use (with good success) has
little tiny brushes on the playing surface. I thought it was BS the
first time I looked at it, but it really does work.
