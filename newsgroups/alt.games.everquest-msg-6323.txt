i'm thinking its more along the lines of newbies to the game wearing crafted
and sporting a runic carver...... guild twinks

my sk made enough plat so far to buy my other characters some nice
banded.....I would have made it myself, but spending more time leveling so I
can get to Velious and loot them all some cougar fangs :P

theres another angle as well, gifts from generous individuals..... my wife
started a de cleric and got all kinds of great stuff before she was even lvl
10 ....... of course she spent most of her time running around healing
everything she saw with 99% hp and less (funny one was "drive-by" healing
someone and she couldnt understand why they wouldnt get better, she found
out they were level 50 and minor healing wasnt cutting it, they gave her
100pp just for being so cool about healing)

dont be bitter, just be cool...... you'll enjoy the game much more

your time is gonna come  :)
