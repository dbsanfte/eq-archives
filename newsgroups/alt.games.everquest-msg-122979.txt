Do I detect unresolved issues here? : )

Seriously, some Legends players may fit your descriptions, but quite a few
of us are just sick to death putting up with non-existant customer service
and don't mind paying extra to have CS done right. Well, until the recent
cutback or GM hours that was the reason anyway.... if the current trend
continues I won't be on too much longer either.

Gameplay-wise it's just like playing a regular server, except you have to
keep an eye out for the events <too avoid getting killed>.
