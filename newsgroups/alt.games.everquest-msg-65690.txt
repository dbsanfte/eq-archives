I've done that repeatedly, it doesn't seem to make any difference
at all.

What really gets me is that the download keeps stopping at the
same point... now hours later, its stopping at a different
point, but trying restart on the download four times in a row,
each is still stopping at the same point.

If anyone has recently successfully downloaded the file eqgame.exe
and would put it up on a web page for me (and anyone else in
the same boat) to download, I'd love to try putting the corrected
copy in and see if the patcher will accept that.

On the other hand, I had an identical problem downloading
eqgfx_dx8.dll last night before the patch, so I don't see how it
can be just that one file.
