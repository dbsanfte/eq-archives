Actually the first 3-5 levels of the game the mail quest is
worthwhile.  Most useful area with it is taking mail from
Felwithe to Kelethin.  do so nets all the money for first
level spells with generally only a trip or two required. 
You get a minimum of a gold piece each time, it adds up
quickly at low levels when your spells only cost a gold
piece each or so.  Sure as Hell beats begging for money form
other players.
