Bang on, yes, and i've seen some major guilds on the tribunal with that
exact problem of being "half split with the flag system".

Also, after looking at levels 61-65, none of them seem to be anything to
lust after. After reading spell descriptions etc, theres nothing really that
is "SOMETHING I REALLY REALLY WANT SO DESPERATLY I WILL MURDER NORRATH FOR
IT". So i end up playing Unreal Tournament instead... :-)
