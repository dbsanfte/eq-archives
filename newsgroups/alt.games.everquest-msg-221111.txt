Perhaps on your server, on mine, the big holdup on groups is tank, and
healer. Neither of those classes usually experiences a problem getting a
group. Nor do enchanters. DPS classes and shammies, on the other hand,
can wait hours to get in those same groups. As for the cost of ornate
molds... Well, if the drop rate in the ele planes is any indication, the
reason they are 5x as expensive is because they simply do not drop as
much. My guild has been raiding the elemental planes for maybe 2 months,
and already has some leather pieces that are rotting. Chain is getting
close. Yet there are plate wearers who have not gotten a single mold
because they just don't drop often.

That said, I do think there needs to be a good deal of fixing done to
warriors. The only place they are preffered over a knight on my server
is in raids. In raiding, defensive makes the warrior king. But as was
said, you don't need many on a raid. A guild with 4 active warriors
probably has enough for just about any encounter. Some mobs, at least in
my guild, do take two warriors; one on the mob, one on rampage. Two more
as backups for those and offtankers is usually enough; if we loose 4
warriors, we are probably wiping anyway. And then there are some
encounters, liek Xegony, where if we loose our MT, we are dead. And a
knight could not do the job at all.

If Sony is unwilling to fix warriors for XP groups, they should at least
change their class description to essentially make people understand
that warriors are a raid class...
