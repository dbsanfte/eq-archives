Problem is, only an incredibly lazy lunatic would pay that much for them.
The people setting these prices must really love watching stuff sit in 
their inventory.

I recently decided to unload my fairly huge collection of wizard runes for 
spells under level 40, about 800 runes all told.  I generally priced them 
at twice the vendor price, 4x vendor if it was for a research-only spell, 
and 50pp if it could be used in cultural tailoring.

At those prices they sell.  But very slowly.  Over a couple months I sold 
about 1/4 of them, mostly the research-only ones.

People asking for more than 10-20pp for the non-tailoring lowbie research 
components are probably fooling themselves.  Well, and it'd be a colossal 
ripoff if anyone -did- pay that much for 'em.

Funny thing is, I recently had my own and two friend's necros go through 
the mid-20's, and I remember Sentient (beza) being the -easy- one to find.  
Think I still have 3-4 of them.  Try the vendors in The Overthere.
