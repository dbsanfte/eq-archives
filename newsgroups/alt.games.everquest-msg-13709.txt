On the other hand, here is how many fights of mine against the Spectres
in Oasis have gone.

1. I click around trying to target the ones in the tower, seeing if I
can find a blue.  I find one.

2. I cast Ice Comet, and then run a ways, to pull the Spectre away from
the tower, so I'll be able to loot the corpse.

3. I stop and start hitting my "root" button.  The idea is to root the
Spectre before it leaves the island, so that I don't have to bring it to
shore to finish it, and risk scaring the lowbies.

4. Spectre has not left the tower.

5. Spectre then warps to right on top of me.

6. Run to shore, root it on shore, and hit it with Rend to finish it.

I've had enough of these damn warping mobs that if or when I find a
pathing exploit, I don't feel guilty getting a few easy kills from it.
It makes up for the extra time I've sat on my ass healing to recover
from the path bugs that have let the mobs exploit me.
