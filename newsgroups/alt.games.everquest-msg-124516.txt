Um, a 1.5sec cast time is _not_ particularly slow.  In fact it's the
same as Stun (L30 for Paladin) which used to be our first stun.  Cease
(or Stun) only seems slow to cast when you are fighting extremely low
level mobs and/or very low level mobs that cast wizard spells.  Pretty
much any 20+ mob that is subject to stun effects can be interrupted at
will by a Paladin (25ish wiz-spell mobs can be trouble when you are
lagged).

Paladin used to have full toolset at L30, but L22 was the bigger deal
I thought (Root!  Invis Undead!).  Now with the 2 new Luclin stuns
Paladin is good to go at L22, _but_ at L30 you get Instrument of Nife
which is wonderfully fun in undead infested dungeons.  Gear fans might
hold out for L45 when you can use the effect on Deepwater Helm.

All-in-all I'd have to say L30 for Paladin, by then even a non-twink
has got effective weapons and serviceable armor, combined with 3 Stuns,
Root, Invis Undead, Instrument of Nife, a serviceable 90 point Heal,
and, of course, the ever popular Lay Hands.
