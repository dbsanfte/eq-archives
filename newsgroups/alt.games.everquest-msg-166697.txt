That's how I envision it, but I do think that the geo hallway is considered
a camp.

Not really, do a camp check in zone and you will hear people shouting,
Queen, Spiders, Geo's, base of pit, etc.  The Queen is at the end of a long
hallway and that area is considered an entire camp, so why not the hall way?
Because of the benefits of a geo.  Also, for the record, Lyrral spent
several levels with the geos and there are not 10 in that area.  There are
about 6 ot 7.  It's very easy for one group of 2 or 3 people or one person
in their 40's, to handle that hallway.  And the spawn time is such that they
are usually hanging out at the bottom, or top, waiting for the cycle to
respawn, for a few minutes.

For the most part everyone respects that the Geo's are a camp.  And for the
most part, at least on Povar, people are really patient when it comes to the
geos, waiting until the camp clears.  I have personally camped it for
several hours, but have also waited for the same several hours.  The best
time to get it, is to be on when the west coast is asleep or at work.

You can be a stickler for the rules, but it won't help you there.  All it
will do is make people annoyed and irritated with you and when you need that
help breaking a train, it won't be forthcoming.  Regardless of how Verant
looks at it, a majority of the players (again, at least on Povar) look at
the Geo's as a camp and choose to respect that, knowing fully well that they
will reap the benefits in turn.

For the record, there are geos in WL to.
