I don't think this is true either.  Some combinations have advantages others
don't.

A Cat bard, for example, has innate safe fall at 50, thats higher than the
bard cap, and they get it right away instead of at 19 or something like that,
so they don't suffer from Selos' over rough terrain nearly as much the first
19 levels (and less always).  They can also fairly easily get a primary hand
string instrument which is much handier than secondary hand; absent cash for
a Lute of the Howler this is a great bonus for that particular combination.

Innorruuk worshipping shaman and clerics can get a clicky snare necklace as a
quest, snare is a -vast- improvement over no snare, which is what all other
clerics and shaman get.

Half elves can't do cultural smithing or tailoring, so if thats' something of
interest, they are right out.  On the other hand they can wear many different
sorts of that armor, so they may have an edge if you want to be a customer.
Of the various religion/race combinations for cultural armor, some are
clearly better than others.  Of course you can live your whole life without
any cultural stuff at all, but it could make a difference.

Iksars can't wear plate, so Iksar SK and Warriors have some armor issues.
Particularly at Hate armor time, Iksar warriors get some stuff that -only-
they can wear, not many Iksar warrriors out there so that can be quite easy
to get ahold of.  Since subsequent releases have added lots more gear that
isn't so much a bonus as it once was, though.

My point isn't that there's a "wrong" way, but that there are certainly some
subtle considerations if you are looking for a "best" class/race/religion
combo.  I think the question is a valid one, but poorly framed.

Style of play is very much effected by your class, even for non min/maxers
and non RPers.

If you think a life spent mostly sitting and occaisionally healing your
buddies who are doing the actual killing sounds boring and meaningless, a
cleric isn't a good choice, regardless of whether thats a highly efficient
way to play, or whether its very much in character for you.

If you'd like to do more than target mob and hit the attack key, you might
not want to play a warrior

If you want to do something other than make mobs stand still, and yell at
people who wake them back up, you might not want to play an enchanter.

If you don't want to be constantly working, moving and clicking on a
different button every second for hours on end, you may want to avoid the
bard

This sort of thing is true for every class, they play differently from each
other, out of the low levels you can't do them all the same way and be at all
effective.

Which is "best" in general isn't really possible to answer, but which is best
-for you- might really have an answer, if we can hear a bit more about what
sort of things you'd like to try.

Personally, there is no "best" for me, because I like learning new play
styles and tinkering around with different characters.  But some parts of the
"new play styles" thing happens by leveling up; the game changes by 20, again
by 30, again by 45 or so, again in the 50s, and again in the 60s and at 65.
So I have to stick with a character for a while sometimes, to see some of the
potential styles inherant in the class.

Bergh, 65 cleric
LLyric, 57 bard
Defeat, 30 warrior
Forssake, 13 shaman

and a host of other long abandoned characters, none over 30
