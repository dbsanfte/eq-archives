I agree with you both.  I was on the verge of abandoning EQ when Stromm
opened.  I've been grouping regularly with the same players since soon
after I started playing there, helped form a guild, and generally find
the game a whole lot more interesting than it's been in a long time.
The social aspect of the game is it's greatest strength, and so long as
SOE continues to reinforce that they'll have a strong player base, imo.
