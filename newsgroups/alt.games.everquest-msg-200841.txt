Easy. An analogy I made in another post really rang more true than I 
originally realized the more I thought about it. This crowd is comprised 
largely of the same people who think there is nothing wrong with 
downloading copyrighted music, software, movies, etc. using utilities 
like Kazaa, BearShare and the like. 

They have a complete disregard for whether it is right or wrong. All they 
know and care about is that they have access to all this media without 
having to pay a dime for it. I have heard from far more than one such 
offender, "Why pay for it when you can get it for free?" The reasons are 
so fucking clear, yet they refuse to acknowledge them for utterly selfish 
reasons. It's all about them and what they want. I have absolutely zero 
respect (less than zero, if that is possible) for people with that 
philosophy, and I find that philosophy indefensible. Therefore I have a 
real problem counting their votes in the KEI debate.

Flame all ya want. Sticks and stones and all that.
