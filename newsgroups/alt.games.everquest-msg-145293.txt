some of my luclin ports cost 600, and my mana regen is insignificant
normally to that of a 60th lv enchanter... and in the nexus today,
assembling groups is exactly what a gnome was doing... and i definitely
don't get 100 plat on average per port, i get maybe 35, regardless of the
cost or the danger of the zone i end up in. Kei is risk free, less mana
relatively than a port, and a popular selling item. Every time i check the
bazaar ( i have a mule), someone is offering money for it, but sometimes,
despite my use of the serverwide channel, i can't find a single buyer for a
port.

Maybe they are in raiding guilds? In any case, they'd be using it in raids
anyway, it's practically their epic, so when they aren't raiding, they are
making money from something they would have bought regardless.
