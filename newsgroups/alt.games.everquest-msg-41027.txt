Of course they are.  I never said otherwise.  But I know where my loyalties
lie first.  One of us over all of them.  If I had a choice, I'd say world
peace for all.  If forced to decide who to save, you know how I value

No you are.  I will never turn the other cheek, if you decide to, that's
your choice, but don't even for one second think that this makes you a
