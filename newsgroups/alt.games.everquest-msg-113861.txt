    As far as I know, if the ratios are close you should always choose the
faster weapon. The reason for this is because as you get higher up in level,
1-handed weapons (2h too) get a damage bonus. Whenever you see "Dmg Bonus:
11" like you see in the second weapon you have listed, it's showing just how
much damage could be added to each swing. The reason the first one doesn't
have that is because it probably just wasn't being held by someone who was
high enough to have one yet or the screenshot was taken before Verant added
that information to weapon descriptions.
    So, knowing that, for instance, you'll be adding 11 per swing to both
weapons, the ratio difference between them gets less and less until at the
very high levels, the faster weapon will actual do more damage per second.
It's very hard to explain and I'm not quite sure I understand it fully
myself, but that's how it was explained to me. :) You might check out
http://www.monkly-business.com and read some of their sections on figuring
out weapon damage and damage bonuses. Also, check out their message boards
because they have the most knowledgable people around. :)
