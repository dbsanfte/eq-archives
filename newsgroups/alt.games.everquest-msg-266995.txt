    I was stumped by the "PA" thing also.  

    And I also wonder what the OP's intent was with this thread.  To get us
all up in arms about Player's Auction's having EQII stuff?  If so then they
would benefit from knowing that most of us have accepted that there seems
to be no practical way to shut this sort of thing down.  Heck, even City of
Heroes, which has no items or economy to speak of, still manages to get
EBAY auctions on Influence, which is a pretty meaningless currency in the
game (it is useful, but plenty easy to get on one's own).  Heck, even today
there are plenty of auctions on EBAY for Simoleans, and The Sims Online is
only a game in the loosest sense of the word.

  So, Cheryl <Cheryl@nowhere.com>, you might just as well announce to the
world that you refuse to play any MMOG that has any sort of tradable
commodities, as Tyas says.  Cause EQII is bring _nothing_ new to the table
in that regard.
