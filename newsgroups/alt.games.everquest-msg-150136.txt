Bad news is the only times I have ever seen him is at night or just after it
gets daylight and someone kills him pdq.  I got lucky and killed him on my
first attempt looking for him, however my buddy who is also lvl 51 got
killed by  green mobs count them now 5 times trying to find him at night.
Good luck to you.
