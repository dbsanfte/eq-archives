    Don't bring the reuse time down and you're nothing but the CotH bitch we
ask to log to a real character after CotH and one rod summoning is done. Why

    Pet? You don't use your pet in the buggy halls of VT, thanks. Last
person to use a pet there brought the entire courtyard in to talk to us
after the pet got GFluxed through the roof. Nuke? Those
less-than-druid-damage nukes that get resisted a lot, from what other mages
say? Why the hell would we want you casting those? And your current best
damage shield is worse than the current best druid damage shield apparently,
so you aren't casting that.

    We were going to recruit one, maybe two more mages before this change.
Now, all mage recruiting is halted and our current mages are considering
permanent switches to other needed classes, like cleric. We don't even need
them for CotH duty any more, since we created several level 55 CotH mules
for just that purpose in Vex Thal (and they can presumably be recycled in
other zones once we move on). The raiding mage got shafted big-time by this.
