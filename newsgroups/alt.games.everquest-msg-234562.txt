From the shadows, the mysterious "-martin" <nospam@cheerful.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

If they did fix this I never heard it, and neither did a lot of other
people considering the frantic bellows of most of the raid leaders
I've been with... but since this is something that would be a bummer
to test (if its still a problem, someone's gonna miss a flag) I don't
know how to find out for sure.

Well, maybe later today when we try a flag mob we haven't beaten yet.
Should be a near full raid with every person there needing the flag.
If someone double hails, someone else will miss out, and then we'll
know.

We do have to beat the SOB though, and this will be attempt eleven if
it comes off....

Yeah, but he doesn't hit hard enough to warrant a chain, so the blast
healers with the MA (a paladin usually in this case, not warrior) can
normally keep up. It's not like they're going to go oom.

I don't question the enchanters, I'm just a dumb ranger. :-p
