You misunderstood his point (reading further into your thread).

Nietzche isn't saying "don't kill anyone," or "killing people is bad."  What
he's said is don't be a monster.

I seriously doubt if you believe (and seriously doubt you'd be stupid enough
to admit it if you did) that our servicemen are monsters and those who
fought in wars are evil.

What he meant was, "don't stoop to their level."  Well, I can guarantee you
that we will not hijack an Afghan commuter flight and kamakaze it into the
heart of their country.  Bombing the slimeballs to Kingdom Come isn't
anything like that.  There will UNDOUBTEDLY be innocent lives lost.  Such is
war.  It sucks but thems the facts of war.

Whoever it was that said "war never solved anything" was full of shit.
