I think the 'new' guy in charge is Smedley (not 100% sure, though).

With Lady Daegarmo (sp?) back in charge of events, and Brad having moved on,
I must say I like the changes I've seen so far.  Though many of them may
have been in the works long before Mr. McQuaid left, it just *appears* that
once he departed, a floodgate of positive changes has started to open up.
