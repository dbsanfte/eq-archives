Though you asked about ores...

You could try the kobolds of Steamfont newbie area. From the Akanon
book go west and you will come to a trio of kobold camps of various
sizes. The kobolds are indifferent to everyone, won't assist other
than the shamans casting heals on kobolds being attacked or attack
spells when they are attacked, and drop hides, teeth, food items,
clothes (for small folks), containers, alcohol, and money. They almost
always drop scalps which are NO DROP and for gnomish quests. The hides
are worth about 7 or 8 gold and the teeth about half that and they all
stack.

No guards path through the area and the primary wandering danger is an
ogre who attacks everyone but is not all that common. Keep your eyes
open and you can avoid her. She drops things that could affect faction
with gnomes but you'd have to get them in to the mage guild? in Akanon
(unlikely).

The kobolds should be okay for you through 8 or 9 when they start to
green out.
