I wasn't trying to disagree, I was trying to encourage the person starting
up their enchanter that mezzing is not the be-all and end-all of enchanter
abilities.

People always leave the game.  People always become disenchanted with the
way the game publisher views their class, and they leave for other games.
It happens in all games.

People who know particular classes very well will always be able to claim
they are the most hard done by.  There has been no new warrior focussed
raid dropped aggro weapon in high end raiding zones since GoD.  However,
there have been other class specific weapon upgrades.  Warriors are trying
to hold aggro in high end raiding against toons who have much more DPS than
they ever did before, using GoD class weapons to do it.  You may or may not
feel that's important - but some warriors feel it's incredibly important
for their class.

I play a number of classes, I don't buy into the 'some classes are more
disenfranchised than others'.
