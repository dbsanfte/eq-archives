No, although my HEF rogue has a nice full set of DE chain
for weddings and such.  Can't make any of it, though, although
can wear human/dark elf/wood elf/high elf cultural stuff, even
imbued if you follow the same deity.

> Also, are there Human cultural items?

Yes...although they're ugly.  Stats aren't bad, but again, it
IS cultural...
