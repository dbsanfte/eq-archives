Go to this page:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/dyn/items/

Pick the slots you want to upgrade and click on them. On the next
screen, use the pulldown menu's to restrict the list to "by class" =
Cleric, and "by stat" = Wisdom ( I assume) and refresh it. This will
show you a list of items you can use and find the ones that would be a
reasonably nice upgrade for you. Then, go to the bazaar and use the
/bazaar command to open up the list of available items and start your
search. Just scan for the stuff you picked out and see if it's in your
price range.

Don't be afraid to look at other cleric items not on your list. Some
shockingly good stuff is going cheaply there.
