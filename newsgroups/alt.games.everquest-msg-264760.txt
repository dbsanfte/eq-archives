What about bank space? I can live with having 4 slots if the bank is large 
enough. I only had 2 alts I played in EQ1, the rest were mules.  I plan on 
sticking to one server anyway. Most of my friends from EQ are not migrating 
(my guild dissolved in the Spring) so I don't really have to consider moving 
around to see who is where.
It would be nice if they upped that figure, but you have to consider that 
would almost double the amount of server space needed to store toons.
