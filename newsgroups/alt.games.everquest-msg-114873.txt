Human and half elf druids are rarely jerks, they're perceptually too
difficult for the jerks to get past level 5 with.

I've never had any problems with female halfling druids, then again I
probably need a larger sample size than zero, male halfling druids on the
other hand... *gurgle*, most of my shitlist consists of these guys (3 male
assling druids that I hate with burning passion, 1 male halfling druid that
I'm on decent terms with).
Never had any issues with any female wood elf druids, other than myself, we
argue too much.  Male wood elf druids also seem to be low on the jerk factor
in my experience.
