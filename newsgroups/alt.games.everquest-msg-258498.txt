I've got this, except it's called 'The Quon, get that healing mojo over 
here on The Big T, Tin boy will be fine, I'll slow the playmates in a

Also got this, it's called 'Bard shut up with the weak CC biatch and 
play mana'.
Alternatives are: 'Come on dead boy, let's do the twitch' and 'Just send 
in Rover and make with the Mod Rods... stop the wannabe nuking.'

They only quad for 4k'

I am this, it's called 'I am enchanter, watch me work, and be in awe'.

(Apologies to Clerics, Plate wearing tanks, Necros, Mages, Monks, and 
Enchanters that might be offended by the sarcastic troll baiting. Oh and 
I guess Bards too. Or anyone I missed.) >-.^<
