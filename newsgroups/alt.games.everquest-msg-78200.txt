Actually you can skip that part, that only give you some info on how to 
do the quest, so forget about Caniel.

Just get the items for Vin Molter to get the container.
Go to Befallen, jump down the pool, the silver ring is at the bottom of 
the pool there.
Kill Gynok in Befallen for Platinum ring (he can drop the others too).
Kill Fungus Mutant in Guk for drops for copper and gold ring.
Give drops to a cat in Kerra to get the rings.
Put rings in container
Press combine
