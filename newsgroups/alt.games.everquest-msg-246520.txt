During the fight yes, pointless... but all those long cast clicky heals 
are worthless during fights. They're more for reducing downtime... which 
can be key in some respawn situations. Or in places where sitting is an 
aggro problem... say a room with a bunch of greens and a red boss/ph 
situation. Where your group just wipes the ph / boss every cycle. But 
can't sit between cycles without pulling piles of junk that you don't 
really want to kill. Clicky heals after the fight and kei for regen 
might be enough to keep everyone going.
