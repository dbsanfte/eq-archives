I know it wouldn't cut much, but, speaking of quests, some of the
quest descriptions look like the person who submitted it just
copy-pasted from their log file. Rather than a page of direct quotes
from the quest NPCs and player responses, etc, most of them could be
reduced to "get a, b, c, d and give them to NPC X"...
