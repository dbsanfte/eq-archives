I know it's an old debate... and that "Usenet etiquette" prefers to not 'Top
post'. Personnally i find it more polite for the readers. If you dont know
the thread going on (all messages beginning by 'Re :' btw) you can go to the
quotes AFTER the answer. See the answer from a "Richard" up here. He quoted
at least 15 blank lines. How funny to scroll down that for nothing : I know
i won't change Usenet by writing that, but that's how i see things.
