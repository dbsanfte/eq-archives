Ah, I wasn't aware that it was targetable (although that makes sense, since
cobalt gauntlets are)

Isn't shrink single target though?  How does MGB help with that?
If you've got enough warriors with bracers, why not just have them use their
bracers even if the shammies have MGB?  It's not like the warriors are doing
any real buffing anyways. (and the few times I've been shrunk, it hasn't
even given an icon, so I don't see any interference with buff order or
anything, just run around, target the big people, click bracer)  Well,
except that shrink is group only... which also doesn't make much sense, but
I guess you can ignore that, since you've got to do it anyways for shaman
shrinks.

Oh, and I checked the spdat parser, says Beastlords get shrink also at level
30, if you guys have any BLs raiding with you yet anyways.
