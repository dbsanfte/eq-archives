Yeah saw that, well ok if the limit of items added to database =
displayed to seller otherwise same ol problem.
    
On a lighter note found one selling a pair of Wu Sticks for 750p on
the roof of last row of stalls near right bankabove the cluster that
always forms on the end of each row. Climbed the pole and snagged the
suckers quick. His afk was on but he ended trader and turned around to
look at me, didnt say anything though.  Gotcha ;)
nice item goes for 2k mostly,  now if I could just find a fungi for
10k....
