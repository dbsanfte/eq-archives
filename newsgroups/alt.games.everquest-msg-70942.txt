Naw, man. You're absolutely right. I don't know the whole situation, and
I'm sure I over reacted, even though he was being a smart assed jerk in
his opening comments. But the fact still stands, that (sad as it may be)
some people will, at times in their lives, find themselves in tight
financial times. This is particularly true in today's economy. However,
coming screaming after Verant and wanting a class action lawsuit against
them because you dont' have the money for a copy of Win 98 doesn't sound
like a very viable option to me.  Priorities, you know? 

I'm not holding any sort of grudge against Jay, but if his personal
situation is as bad as he makes it out to be, I think EQ compatibility
is the least of his worries. I do, however, hope things turn for the
better for him and his family soon.
