You can't leave all items in your house, at least not without a strong box. 
But certain quest items like tomes become placeable in the house after the 
quest is complete.  The citizenship tome is one of these.  Had mine sitting 
on my Antonian desk in beta.  So they don't go to quite the degree of SWG 
where you could place everything and anything in the house.  But, like SWG 
there is also an item limit.  At one point in beta they had the small 
apartment's limit set to 20 items.  I think they raised that, but I don't 
know to what number.

On a side note, it took me a while to figure out how to actually rotate 
furniture and items in the apartment during beta.  Should have thought of 
trying to use the scroll wheel, but I didn't.  The tutorial in the Isle of 
Refuge tells you how to move furniture, but not rotate it.  :(  I'm hoping 
that instructions on how to do that will actually be in the game manual so 
that others don't have to ask as I did.
