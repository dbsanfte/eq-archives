You say that it irritates you that people think they are not bound by rules,
yet your state that you are willing to break them when it suits you (ie, you
don't like the consequences of being late to wherever you're going).  It's
not a matter of accepting responsiblity for what you do, it's a matter of
what you say should be done, and what you do not matching up.
