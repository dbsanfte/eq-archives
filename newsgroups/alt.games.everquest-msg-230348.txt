I would have said he was in error, that of course a person is going to
run for the zone line so he is foolish for being in the way. I would
have said the same thing to his guild, asking them why on earth they'd
have such an ignorant newbie in their guild.

In both cases, its a case of it being up to the player to beware. Its
not against the rules to kill guards that you can kill, nor is it
against the rules to flee. So in both cases players are not in the
wrong.

People who hang around right at zone points, killing things and
expecting not to get trained by people fleeing, are idiots.
