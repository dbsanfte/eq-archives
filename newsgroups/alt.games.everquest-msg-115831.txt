	You mean the one I use as desktop wallpaper?  (Modified to remove the
garish colors and to produce a bas-relief effect.)

|Rivervale borders Kithicor Forest, which borders Nektulos
|Forest directly. Not a human in sight, unless you count a few rangers in log
|cabins. 

	There are three Human settlements in Kithicor other than the Ranger
station (manned by Humans, not pecks).  Those small clumps of buildings are
supposed to be villages.  There are no Halfling settlements at all.  There is
one camp of Teir'dal who, AFAIK, are effectively in exile, stuck out in what
is to Neriak the ass end of the world.

|That map may not look the way the zones are situated in game (look
|at the area near Oggok to see how messed up it is), but it is canon.

	If there is a discrepancy between the map and the game, the map is wrong.

|    Wow, that sounds like... High Elves and Sal'Varae's Robe! The exact
|piece of equipment I mentioned! I HAVE seen this happen, and I DID NOT whine
|about it because that accomplishes nothing.

	No, because by your own admission High Elves don't have the best Cleric
stats -- Dwarves do.  Dwarves get the good stats, but lose out on some items.
Wood Elves get the good stats, but lose out on...help me out, here....

|Nor did I moan about High Elves
|getting all the PoG gear while my deity has no equivalent gear.

	High Elf Clerics get one item out of Growth that you can't get -- and it's
not that big a deal of an item.  Tunare-worshipping Rangers (primarily Wood
Elves) get the Helm of the Tracker out of Growth -- and it's the best Ranger
helm in the game.

	(And that robe you've mentioned is a NToV drop, meaning 95% of the players
are never going to see one.  Any mook can get the Helm of the Tracker -- I've
got three of the four heads in the bank, and could get the fourth any time I
wanted.  I can even do the turn-in.  I just can't wear the helm.)

|When the Plane of Underfoot is added, then I'll have my quests, and that's more than

	And Elvis will be along any second now.

|
|    So there is a downside.

	Up until a month ago, there wasn't.  And it's not really much of a down
side -- the difference between Wood Elves and Halflings is smaller than the
difference between Wood Elves and Humans by a long shot.

|    You can also use Karana-restricted items if you're a ranger of Karana.
|At present, that's a limited number of items.

	No, at present it's effectively ZERO.  Karana-imbued jewelry is complete
garbage; you might find a Druid wearing some but I doubt it.  The armor is
likewise junk, at least the leather-based stuff; you won't even find it on a
twink.  There's a nice AC 51 Halfling cultural BP in this latest wave, but
it's PAL only; the chain recipe hasn't been found yet but given what the human
cultural chain is like, it's expected to suck ass.

|After Karana's plane is
|introduced in PoP I imagine you'll see more, similar to the quests in PoG
|for Tunare followers.

	I'm not interested in what the game might be like six months from now.
Why should I believe the game will be any better balanced then than it is now?
For whatever reason, the designers have decided that Tunare is the only
religion in the game worth following.

|    Poor thing. Would you like a cookie?

	No, I want it fixed.

|    So you created your character just because you thought he'd get an XP
|bonus over other rangers?

	Actually I would have made him human regardless; I dislike non-human
races.  (I don't normally allow them when GMing; it is catagorically
impossible for a human to roleplay a non-human.)

|You regard all of human cultural smithing as "no
|racial skills"? 

	a) By "racial skills" I mean things like Hide, Sneak, Forage, etc.

	b) Human cultural smithing is worthless, there's not one item anyone would
equip below the new heraldric plate -- which Rangers, of course, can't wear.
The cultural chain is garbage, you won't even find it on twinks.  You might
have found some throwing classes using Antonica javelins at one point, but
these days you're better off with velium ones ('coz anyone can make them and
there's less farming).  It certainly has nothing to offer Rangers.

|You think GFAY (dark even with Infravision, almost no
|landmarks) is better to start in than the Qeynos Hills area?

	By miles.  It's bindable (Soubinder available, nearest Soulbinder to
QHills is two zones away), there's a bank and shops (QHills shops offer crummy
prices, nearest bank two zones away), it's got a better dungeon next to it
which benefits greatly from the above.  Faydwer in general has a better
selection of hunting grounds too, after you're done with GFay.  Western
Antonica is barren.
