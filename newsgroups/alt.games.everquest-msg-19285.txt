Unfortunately most of the quest weapons i know of are for
level 20 and above, however several of these quest weapons
and some drop weapons go for dirt cheap.

for a barb warrior, a langseaxe and later a pair of them for
duel wield are quite nice
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=247   They usually
sell for under 20 pp.

you can also get a gnoll hide lariat cheap
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=2665  while not a
great weapon, its wonderful for raising skill due to the low
delay.

Another cheap one, but a little rarer than the gnoll hide
lariat is the tentacle whip
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=165

There are several velium weapons that can also generally be
purchased for under 15 pp.

magical 2hs are usually more expensive, but you might find
someone selling a velium 2h sword, again for under 15 pp.
other 2hs options i can think of are generally over 100pp,
usually over 200
