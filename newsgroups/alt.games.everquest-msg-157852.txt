Rather odd way to use the word 'scam', I'd say.  The damage from the
proc hurts the mob just as well as any other damage.  If the proc is
indeed unresistable then it's gonna do it's 10 DPS vs. any mob, even
a mob whose AC greatly weakens the Cleric's basic melee output.  I
sure as hell wouldn't call an unresistable 10 DPS added to my melee
output a scam, any more than the very resistable 5 DPS or so I get
out of Instrument of Nife vs. Undead is a scam.
