BS!!

The Nexus will only drop you at 4 old world locations and nowhere in
Velious. A trip through the Nexus takes at least 20-30 minutes if you
are lucky. The only decline in traffic is near rings with Nexus ports.
(Dreadlands, North Karana, Greater Feydark, Toxx). 

All other Druid Rings are still great money makers and I have seen no
decline at all with my 50 Druid. I can still make hundreds of PP over
2-3 hours bouncing between rings. Name one other class that has it so
good, other than 49+ Clerics selling rezzes in popular zones.

Waah Waah Waah! 

Druids in EQ are the MOST versatile class in EQ. Nothing was taken
away from Druids with the launch of SoL (Nexus). The ability to group
teleport is a convenience that other players are willing to pay for.
It saddens me to see spoiled-brat Druids crying because they cannot
drum up as much business as before. 

>We got nothing from Luclin but some fairly lame spells. 

Yeah all those Group Skin spells sure do suck...NOT! 700mana to drop
Skin Like Nature on a group of 6 is a fantastic new spell. What did
you expect for new spells? Druids are already one of the best soloing
classes in the game. They hardly needed improving (some could argue
that Druids are weak 50+ under raid conditions, but all of the 1-50
soloists suffer that fate.)

This analogy is completely flawed. Other classes were not given
personal or group teleports. The Nexus merely eliminated travel time
between the old world continents through the use of teleportation.
Every class (including Druids!) can use the Nexus if their account is
SoL enabled. 

It will always be faster to use a Druid/Wizard, and players will still
pay for the service.
