Sigh, I know it's marketed towards kids and all but that has nothing
to do with the fact that they play. Unless someone over the age of 18
purchases an account and officially deems it ok that a child can use
their account, teens cannot play this game. I'm talking legally there
is no reason for the stupid swear filter or any censorship at all, if
anything the stupid kids who get KSed or someone insults them once or
something will be the ones going off on their little ooc cussing
rants. If it were a perfect world they would make it illegal for
people under the age of 18 to play since they are the only ones who
can legally own an account, then there would be no need for GMs other
than to sit on their ass in CS and wait for the next person to exploit
a bug the programmers feel the need to leave in and ban everyone
involved and disband their guild. Once again, I don't care if it's
marketed towards kids like beer and alcohol and crack and weed and
underage hookers are, just because kids can play doesn't mean the rest
of us who are playing the game that actually own accounts should
suffer.
