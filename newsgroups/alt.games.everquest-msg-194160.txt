You can have one of each of the various types of focus effects working at
any given time.

Extended Range and Increased Damage "stack" so you get longer range and
bigger nukes.

Two Extended Range items don't stack, so you only get the single longer
distance, not twice as much.

All the ER and ID items have the same amount of bonus to them, the "I, II,
III, and IV" part refers to the maximum level spell they will affect.  If
you have an ER 3 item (max level spell 20 or so) your level 12 spells will
have the longer range but your level 25 spells won't.  Then if you get a
ER III item, suddenly your level 25 spells will also have a longer range.
Each level includes all the levels under it, so you won't need to hang
onto the ER II item to keep your level 12 spell's at high range.

There are some bonus items in the high end game that have larger bonus
effects, "haste of Mithaniel" (faster casting buffs and heals) and so
forth that have more powerful effects than normal, wider application focus
effects.
