Welcome to EQ!  Like Brent said, it's patch day.  The servers are usually
back up by 3pm eastern.

A tip:  EQ players have very little patience with people who like to type
with upsy-downsy letters like "cOrPoRaL."  You might want to lose that habit
or you'll undoubtedly get harassed.

If you don't know how to change your display name in OE5 just give a holler.
