it means fighting monsters four at a time.  generally this is
accomplished by snaring the mosters and letting them chase you
around so they get tightly packed together, then casting some sort
of area-of-effect damage spell that can hit all four monsters at
once.

it's a very efficient way to kill lots of monsters, assuming
you can find an area that has the right conditions.
