Clawbeasts and Deathmaws are not exactly what I'd call rare... I see them
quite often actually when I run through Shadeweavers -- usually kill one or
two since they hurt me so bad when I was a baby :)

Umm.... I think they spawn when you kill ordinary Saureks.  I remember when
I was hunting Saureks for HQ hopperhides I would eventually run out of them
and start seeing just Darkclaws and a few Claw Beasts and Deathmaws.  Try
killing your ordinary saureks and then kill the darkclaws as they spawn --
if I'm guessing right that should give you a few of the big dudes to fight.
