That doesn't make a lot of sense though...   giants in Rathe Mtns max out at
level 37 (I hunted Rathe Mtns a *lot* before OT even existed), with the
majority in the 33-35 range.  OT sarnaks, rhinos, succulents, chickens are
all in the 30-35 range as well, and I believe actually max out higher at 39
(rare, but the higher level ones also have a different name so you can hunt
them specifically).

I'm a 1600 AC, 7k hp monk and I can't guarantee a win soloing a cliff golem. 
I'd wait a bit.  :)

On the other hand, when you get close to my level they'll be a helluva lot
easier for you to solo.  My magician can take both cliff golems and a couple
dragoons on at the same time.  Gawd it's good to be a monk.  :P
