I had a problem with missing text on the character select screen and
in the various chat boxes in game.  There were a couple of posts here
with the same issues and 5-10 on the Everquest board.  Apparently,
this only happens to Windows 98 and ME systems.  It doesn't appear to
matter what the hardware is though.  Sony made a bunch of suggestions
but as usual none of them worked.  There are a couple of work arounds
that may help.

What worked for me last night was to enter windows mode (ALT-ENTER) as
the liscence screen before you press "I AGREE".  I got in and
everything was normal.  Played for a couple of hours and even switched
characters.  Everything worked. Except - you can't go to full screen
mode.  Then you loose much of the text again like the friends list,
guild tools, drop downs, etc.

Another partial work around was already posted here but it doesn't
work completely for most users.  You don't have the char select text
or some of the in game text that a lot of people need.  Just sign in
as normal and go to the character select screen.  Pull up your toon by
pressing the unlabeled button that corresponds to the char you want. 
You will know you got the right one when it appears in the room.  Then
press the lower left hand button to Enter Game.  Or press the lower
right hand buttom to Exit.  Don't press the middle one cause that is
delete Character.  Once in game, press enter to get you to the chat
entry line.  This is all blind because you can't see what you are
doing.  Then type /loadskin default - this will reload things.  You'll
get a screen showing where you are.  This takes a couple of minutes
but will eventually pop back to a regular screen.  Then press enter
again and type /fontface ariel.  This should get most of the in game
text back.  And then you are off and running.

Good Luck
