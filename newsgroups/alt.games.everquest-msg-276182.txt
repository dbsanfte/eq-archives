In EQ, once you hit the maximum level, death became meaningless with 
corpse summoners available.  It is even more meaningless now with the 
guild hall corpse summoner for a fee.  When level 65 was the maximum 
level, and I had hit 65, and just kept 10% xp going into regular level, I 
ate almost 30 deaths over time until OOW upped the maximum level.  I 
didn't care, and it made me feel free to try ludicrous things.  At times 
I had to get a corpse summoner to help me get my corpse, but it was never 
hard to do.

Even before the max level, with 96% rezzes available, death was pretty 
meaningless in EQ1 so long as your corpse was accessible.  I tried all 
sorts of things long before I hit my maximum level just to see if I 
could.

There were a few places where the CR was just totally ludicrous to do, 
but most zones, there were reasonable options, such as a necro or sk to 
summon the corpses.
