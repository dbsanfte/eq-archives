Well, if this newbie zone thing is correct, then Field of Bone, Warsliks 
Woods, Swamp of No Hope and LOIO all have the same exp modifier. They *all* 
have newbie areas in them. I still think I got the same 1/2 blue bubble in 
OT 
that I did in LOIO.

How about Greater Faydark? Everfrost? Both have newbie zones. And, I always 
seemed to get WAY more exp in Crushbone than in GFay. From what you're 
saying, 
you'd get more exp in GFay.

In the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter - LOIO is so over-camped 
that 
I'd say that the exp comes out the same in the end.
