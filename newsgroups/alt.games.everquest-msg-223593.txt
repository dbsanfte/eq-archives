Hi All;

I was in the bazaar looking for a Range slot item. I ran across an item
useable by a cleric. It had a clicky spell called: Transmute Hunter's Barb.

I looked this up on Lucy and it says summons item #xxxxxxxx.  It had, live
11/5.  So if I understand Lucy correct, this is some kind of new spell that
will summon something and is brand new.

I'm a 62 Hafling Cleric that occasionally will melee if the group is safe,
so this caught my attention.

Does anyone have this spell and if so, what does it do, and would hit help a
part time melee cleric??    I did Google and several other searches and
can't find anything about this.

Thank you in advance for your time and help.

Doctorzoid
