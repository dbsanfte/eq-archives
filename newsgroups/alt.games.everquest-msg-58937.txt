That kind of depends on what you want to do with him/her, what sort of
equipment you may or may not have for him/her.

Int is EXTREMELY important as it determines the success/failure of most of
your spells, and how much mana you'll have to use, as with your Necro.  Mana
is a Good Thing [TM].

Cha, OTOH, determines the duration/success of your Charm and Mez-type
spells.  If you intend to do much of this, you'll want a decent Cha as well,
but you don't really want to sacrifice Intelligence for Charisma, because
you just won't have the mana to Mez the daylights out of a camp.

Being Agnostic is a tremendous boon.  Remember, though, that illusions mask
ONLY your race, and don't modify anything else.  Hence, if you kill orcs in
Crushbone for several levels, Illusion: Dark Elf isn't going to help you all
that much in Neriak -- you're still a target.  You're just a blue one. 8)

> Any suggestions of where I should put my stats?

HE is a good choice because they're naturally charismatic.  Unfortunatly,
they're not as intelligent as Gnomes, Dark Elves, or Erudites.  I'd put 10
about of your 30 points into Cha, and then most of the rest into Int.  Some
people like to drop some into agility, but High Elves are pretty darn agile
already.

> And -is- Agnostic the best?

Yes.  As above, your illusion spells won't mask your faith.  That means you
can -look- like an Ogre and still be KoS in Oggok because of your religion.

> Or is there a better choice so I can do quests?

One of the neat things about Enchanters is that they can generally go pretty
much everywhere.  After about 16th level, you can go most places (within
reason) and make most folks like you.  So long as you keep a close eye on
your faction (i.e. watch what you hunt!) you're going to be one of the most
mobile folks in the game.  My Erudite can waltz into Neriak w/o her illusion
(dubious), lay down Illusion: Dark Elf (you get that at 12th), and do the
red wine quest.  Or cast Alliance.  And if something hits her, she just
casts Memory Blur and wanders off.
