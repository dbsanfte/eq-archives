I would say SK cos it is more offensive then Pally and one major advantages
is that SK can fear and snare.  I have never played a Pally so I can't tell
you anything on it's soloing ability but I would guess a SK is better at
soloing as I have 1 myself.

As for Monk, sure they can solo if you can afford a 25k+ Fungi Tunic, FBSS
or better haste item and good weapons.... that's at later levels I meant,
all classes can solo into the 30s, in my opinion, without much twinking....

Just my personal opinions, dont flame me if anyone disagree :)
