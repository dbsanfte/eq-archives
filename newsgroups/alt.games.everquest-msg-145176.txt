It seems like a waste of their time to implement this, unless there's a
class out there with so many spells they are running out of pages in
the book?

I'm really quite nervous that I'm going to accidentally erase some
high level vendor buyable spells now, while swapping spells in
and out of my book.  Will this be crippling?  No, but its hard
to imagine I'm going to be pleased at losing ANY spell I was
about to memorize, even if this can only happpen to ones
I'll be able to buy.  Some of mine are buyable only at FV,
as I recall, so thats an out of my way walk, not just a port
to Kaladim and gate back situation.  For other classes with
even more hidden spell vendors, this would be even more
of a nuisance.  If I could think of any reason at all for wanting
to be able to erase spells I wouldn't feel bad about the
risk, mind you... but I'm 60th level, have all but 8 of my spells,
and TONS of room left in my book.

Now if they would let me mem spells more than once, I'd
gladly buy scrolls to do so, and make up pages for different
situations... then I might actually use so much book space
I'd be glad to be able to kill Minor Healing and so forth.
