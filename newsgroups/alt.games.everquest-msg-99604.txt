I figured out how to set up the other hit boxes, and thought finally I can
get the battle spam out of my chat window. But the misses, blocks, parries
and all other messages other than actual hits still remain in the chat
window. I play a 53 monk and with haste and good weapons, in high end group
situations there are still a freakin boatload of misses spamming my chat
window. What the hell is the point of putting hits in a separate window but
leaving the misses in the chat window? Do the programmers ever play this
game? I'm hoping this gets fixed in the very next patch.
