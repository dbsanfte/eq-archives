What, from me? :P  My nervous twitches come from people doing this in, 
well, there was the time in North Ro when we had a group cutting through 
dervs like butter and someone dragged us all to orc highway so we could 
get eaten three times.  :p  And there've been many, MANY HHK groups 
that've said "we're doing so well here - I'm gonna go pull the raider 
room."

Lord knows how the 10-30 range inspires elitist comments. :p
