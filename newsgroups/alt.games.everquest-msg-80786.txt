I believe we did Solusek A and B with those level groupings.  It was
convenient because of the proximity of the dungeons to each other.  That
way if the 20s group wiped out and needed help, a higher level group
wasn't far away.  Plus they are both near a convenient druid ring if
reinforcements should be needed for bad corpse runs and such.  I suppose
you could substitute Najena for Sol A as well.
