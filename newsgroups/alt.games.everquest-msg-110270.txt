How about in zones that boats travel through you have to pick up a
soul bound shard to allow you to zone without the boats.  This way
everyone has to make the boat journey at least once but then you can
swim from there after if you are brave enough.  Definitely charge for
portals near the docks (5-10pp) so that the wizards/druid that make a
profit on ports are still in business if you want a specific
destination but the average PC can still get accross oceans with
relative speed.
