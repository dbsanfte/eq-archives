Except I didn't say 'necessary', particularly within the scope of a 
logical argument, where necessary means 'strictly necessary'. I said 
'crucial', using the definition which simply means of great importance.

Having a tracker is very important. Take any combo of classes, and all 
of these things become easy and fast if they have a tracker... all of 
them become "very hard and/or time consuming" if you don't. Therefore a 
tracker is crucial.
