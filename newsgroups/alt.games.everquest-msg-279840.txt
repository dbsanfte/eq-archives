Variety, releif from boredom.

Well, I would get bored stiff of raiding quickly, and quit if there was 
not variety.

That is still a choice that is being made.  Personally, I have not, and 
will not just repeat endlessly the same mission, I'll just do without the 
upgrades if that is my only option.  In fact, I have done without them, 
and still am.  I have a grand total of one spell, and one augment from 
DoN.

But there are all sorts of great items to be had from many different 
places in the game that are single groupable.

If the game is all about the treadmill to you, then all I can say, is 
quit, it's not worth it.

I don't raid just for the upgrades, that is just a nice bonus, I raid 
because I enjoy it.  I play the game to have fun.  When it stops being 
fun, I stop playing.

I will agree that Vanguard sounds like they have it right, but, speaking 
for me personally, I have never taken the path of least resistance in EQ.  
From long before I became guilded, I played the game to have fun, I had 
crap for equipment, and frankly, I just didn't care all that much.  I was 
having fun exploring new places, trying out tradeskills, completing 
quests for items that, at best, were marginal upgrades.  Completing 
ludicrously difficult quests just because I could.  Trying my hand at 
soloing mobs just to see if I could.  Trying new zones with groups of 
like minded people just to see them, and see if we could.
