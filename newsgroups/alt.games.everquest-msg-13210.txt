The same thing happened to me at Erudin dock. I was walking on LAND when a
shark bit me for 30 damage ?!    I turn around, nothing. Whack! another 26
damage. Crap, I am always sow'ed so I run for the teleports, Whack! another
30 damage. I started running backwards so I can see the damn shark, but it
was nowhere to be seen. It was no big deal, didn't die or anything but it
was pretty annoying.
