In the case of a shaman, it takes no cleverness at all.  Sow up.  Get a mobs
attention.  Run.  Nuke.  Run.  Nuke.  Repeat until mob is dead.  The one
difference is without snare, the timing is a bit tougher, you will often get
smacked just before the nuke goes off.  I prefer the root and rot method,
again, very simple, root, DoT, DoT, move, sit and med.  Repeat as needed.
