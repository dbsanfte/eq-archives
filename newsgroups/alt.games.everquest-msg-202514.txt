You have to play within the confines of game mechanics. In other words
your choices are to group or solo with extended periods of downtime
since KEI was "nerfed". No amount of whining will change that, because
that is how the game is coded now.

You could always play a more "mana friendly" class if downtime is a
problem for you when soloing.
