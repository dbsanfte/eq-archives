Hi Caeli

Perhaps have you already heard about EQWatcher?
It is a programmable EQ log parser, that allow to actively interact 
with it while EQ running, typing commands as notes (/note command 
parms).
The script language is quite simple, the interface (offgame) is 
simple too and it has these WinAmp specific functions, I think it 
does the same or even better.

This ware is quite evolutive because YOU decide what he can do.
The most important feature is the speak item (you will only need to 
download and install the official Microsoft Speech API): the log 
delivers its informations in the game, talking to you with a 
synthetized voice (thanks to the API), regarding of the functions 
and commands written and available in your script file(s).

The official URL is:

   http://www.eqwatcher.com/

It can seem complicated to use at a first glance but he really rock 
and can do as much as anyother non programmable log parser, if you 
take a little of your game time to learn the script language and 
write your functions (use timers and log text triggers as well as 
builtin commands).

Give it a try, it really worth it.

As a concrete example: it tells you what damage per second you made 
after each fight, it warns you your spells will fade soon, it 
speaks the /tell's you receive, or the group tells, it warns you of 
others' loot, etc...

BUT..... the only EQ feature you must turn off is the native EQ 
sound, no more nice cratchy sound while fighting ;)
