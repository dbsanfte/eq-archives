We give directions on how to get where we're going and we expect people to
pay attention or get lost.  If we have to summon their corpse and it's
because they were a total twit, they have to pay for the coffin (guild
usually picks up all expenses).

Inside dungeons where this isn't practible, we expect the leader to know how
to lead without "disappearing" every 15 seconds.

The only time AF is essential is if you're on a bard's travel-train. :)
(btw, NEVER EVER AUTOFOLLOW A BARD!!!!!)
