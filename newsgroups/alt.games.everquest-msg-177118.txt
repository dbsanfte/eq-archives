I started a Barbarian Beastlord last week, took me no time to get to level
6.  I was having problems finding blues and was getting semi-frustrated.
Then I remembered the fun I had when my warrior was a youngin in
Blackburrow.  I run my Beastlord over there and start killing things, take
a look at my XP and I already have a yellow bulb and then some.  It was
crazy.  I looked on eqatlas and did not see a ZEM, but there is definitely
a big one in there.  I went from level 6 to level 8 in about an hour and a
half, unbuffed.  And pretty decent cash too as they routinely drop
med/high/flawless hides and blood vials that all sell for 1gp a piece.
Just thought id give you all a heads up with the new froggies coming and
all :)
