I think you have summed up best what it is I miss about EQ prior to PoP.  
The last two of my old time friends I made back in the old days just 
retired from EQ.  One of them I met after I had made the very lengthy 
journey from Halas to Kelethin, I helped her out with some quest, and 
through her I met many other folks that became friends as well.  We had a 
great time, and generally moved around to different areas together to 
find new hunting grounds.  A few months later, after we had made the move 
to The Overthere, we ran into some other folks, who we started playing 
with regularly, one of them was the other person who just recently 
retired.  For both of them, the magic had gone out of the game some time 
ago, as it has for me.  I still enjoy raiding, and I still log on for 
raids, and at times to attempt to group somewhere, which is becoming 
harder and harder to do.  It's depressing to check the LFG tool, and find 
maybe 8 to 12 people total in my level range that are LFG.

If someone were to come out with an MMOG that was a lot more like the 
original EQ, I'd switch over in a heartbeat, and play it, timesinks and 
all.
