Which aftermath?  All of the bitching and moaning and gnashing of teeth?
Or the determined attempts by the 10% of the oobahs who don't just quit
to get "their" stuff back?  Don't get me wrong, a world with dynamic
content including bad things that can happen to the players, would be
great, IMO.  But I don't think a very large fraction of the player base
would agree with me, and most of those who did would likely change their
minds just as soon as the bank got knocked over when they had half their
epic drops stored there.
