Hail all!

I got a corroded piece and all the gems needed for the quest and my
faction with Thurgadin dwarfs is kindly. When I hail the NPC Asgarh(?)
quest, he does talk to me about the all the Ranger armor pieces que he
can make for me.
Now, some guildmates told me that I need Ally faction, others said to
try to get at least Warmly faction, and finally told me that if the NPC
talks to me, that's all I need.

What's the deal? Thanks much!
