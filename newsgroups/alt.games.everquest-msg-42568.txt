egad i certainly hope not . Kinda understandable in college but once you get
out in the working world things will improve a bit . You wont have nearly as
much time to play, but money usually isnt a problem if you can manage to
only spend $9 on three cups of cafe breve every other day instead of every
day.

I dont even mind allakhazams having extra pictures to download . I dont
really mind him making a hefty profit either. However I do know the cost of
bandwith . I use allakhazams maybe an hour total a month and most of that
time is spent looking at the pages not full time downloading .Say 15 mins of
real downloading at most Bandwith costs are about a penny and half a minute
at absolute most assuming that he is paying TOP dollar to a rapacious
supplier :). This means I figure on using less than a quarters worth of
bandwith a month . I figure my yearly rate should be $3 . He is kinda going
for that high profit margin :)
