55, I don't have Dictate yet.  In a recent Kael raid a level 60 was doing a
great job with Charm, but while fighting 3-4 critters at a time in the
icehouse (I think that's where we were, I don't know the landmark lingo
yet...then again, I still don't know which one is Orca 1 in EC :) ) and
simply trying to keep alive & keep extras rooted (I made the mistake of
going in without charm and every time I sat to memo it...BAM) I may have
missed some of the action she was going through. :)
