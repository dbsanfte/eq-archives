Actually, bargaining is one of the norms of reality.  The real problem, is
the fact that some people overestimate or sometimes underestimate their
wares.  One guy insisted on selling a Jade Reaver at 40k, when it normally
goes for 20k on my server.  This is also the case for when the focusing
effects came into play, people overestimated the value of an object due to
the focus effect, not because of its rarity.  Just because the demand went
up and the rarity of the item did not change, does not mean you
dramatically increase the value of the item.

Newbie begging will still exist, even when you are not selling anything or
you are selling things.
