Wrongo, bub.  I play a chanter and the 3 or so times I went there, I killed 
every mob I could find while waiting for a HG to pop.

Bullshit is stating a definitive clause such as "Chanters on the other hand 
NEVER kill PH."

Asses DO come in all classes, and from what I've seen, they tend to focus 
in the classes that can get EXP the fastest, usually solo.
