You think that's bad?  At least it was a pet, not a group member.

I was in a group with a druid, we both got charmed, but charm never wore
off the druid.  He even rebooted his computer, but his character was
still wandering around charmed, with <LD> over his head, following the
mob pathing.  

Then he despawned and I got a message that my charm spell wore off, so
we figured out what must have happened.  I got charmed, then while I was
charmed I must have charmed him.  Kind of funny, really.
