No it's not proven false.
This isn't EQ, your EQ definition of Kill stealing is irrelevant since
it doesn't mean the same thing in CoH.

You're arguing that there can be only one possible definition for the
term and it's your one.

Here's a perfect example of why you're wrong.

Fag.
In the USA that means homosexual.
In the UK it means cigarette.

Kill stealing.
In EQ it means attacking any mob that's already being attacked by
another player.
In CoH it means attacking a mob that you can gain no experience for,
that's already being attacked by another player.  In short - griefing,
because there's no point in your attacking it except to deprive the
other player of that exp.

You're like an American going to Britain and arguing that Fag means
homosexual, regardless of what it means in Britain.
[Or a Brit going to the US and arguing that it means cigarette, no
matter what the Americans think it means.]

So much for the universal meanings you're arguing for.

Oh and a quote I saw about a decade back on Fidonet about the fag
meaning difference between US/UK.
"Sucking on the wet butt of a fag leaves a residue in my mouth." - some
british guy talking about unfiltered cigarettes.

Quit a different meaning and mental image for an American reading the
same sentence isn't it?

1. The number of complaints about kill stealing in the forums is very
minor.
2. The number of people who actually post on the forums is under 5% of
the playerbase.

If the problem that you're trying to paint existed, the broadcast and
request channels would be constantly filled with complaints about
killstealing, and they aren't.

So you've got what, .01% of 5% of people complaining about what they
think kill stealing is, regardless of what the rules of the game say it
is.

All of which is irrelevant to the actual rules.

You can have any opinion you want, it's not going to change what the
rules actually are.

Complain about something that's NOT against the rules and you can expect
the GM's to tell you that you have no legitimate complaint.

That's the bottom line, the GM's are there to deal with actual
rule-breaking and technical problems, not to enforce random players'
beliefs on other players.

And that is exactly what you want them to do, enforce YOUR beliefs on
the rest of the player base whether they agree with you or not.

You've made that perfectly clear, you don't care what the rules are, you
don't care what the CoH playerbase wants or how CoH does things, You
want things done your way you're used to - the EQ way.

Frankly you come off as a whiny teenager who doesn't want to be bothered
learning the different way things work in a different game - you want
the game changed to suit what you've learned elsewhere.

If I, and the multitude of other happy CoH players, wanted to play
things the EQ way, we'd be playing EQ.

But we don't, so we're not.
