On second thought, I have reconsidered...

Getting a chance to kick your ass would be worth the $$$..

Rubbing your nose in it when you chicken out would be even better.....

So, yea, I'll purchase plane tickets in your name..

All I will need is proof positive of your identification, address, and
scans of your passport or visa....

You provide that to me and the plane tickets are yours...
