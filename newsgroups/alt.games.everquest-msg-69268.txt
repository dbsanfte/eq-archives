No, you've nailed it right on the nose.  Luclin users -do- have the edge 
here.  I'm sure it follows the story line somehow, though.  But, if they 
wanted everyone to have this travel capability, the could have made the 
storyline fit for having this port ability in the old worlds.

Their goal is to sell as many of these add-ons as they can, and this is 
just another carrot.
