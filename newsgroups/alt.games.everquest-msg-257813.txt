On shortly after the repatch, there's not much going on, but a group 
using LFP in Natimbia or whatever the name of that zone is.

I like the LFP tool, hardly ever see anyone use it on Luclin though, at 
least on FV you'd see three or four groups up most of the time even if 
half of them were full.

So I send a tell and get an invite, run over.  From POK thats Hallas 
stone, magus to Nediara's Landing, Magus to Natimbia.  PITA, more of 
classic Verant era time wasting, if I'm going to Magus why not just 
straight to my destination, instead of a change of bus?

Show up, its a warrior, beastlord, SK, cleric; Beastlord runs over to 
the shore opposite the magus and shows me where to go.  They are already 
engaged, I get an invite and start bashing on a blue to me mob.  That 
mob dies, beastlord complains he can't stick slows; I comment, semi 
joking, that berserker slows stick fine, which is sort of true: stuns 
all stuck, which amounts to some sort of slow, if only on one target and 
only so long as I keep on top of things.

We pull a couple more, I get beasty crack which doesn't excite me, I 
comment that I could use a haste but never get it.

At any rate, final pull is coming up from the camp they are doing, the 
SK announces it will be a double and he needs someone to off tank. 
Well, he pulls and nobody peels the add off him so I do it, and start 
off tanking.  Mob is tough compared to what I'm used to taking down, its 
hitting me for up to 196 a pop, and of course its unslowed save for the 
stunning I'm doing; I've tanked mobs this hard but with a real slow 
stacked on top of my stunning.  Cleric keeps using Divine Light on me, 
which is only good for about a third of my hp bar.  Meanwhile, he's also 
having to keep the MT alive while the group takes down the real target. 
  Eventually cleric goes OOM (which I could have told him, spending it 
on DL like that) just as the first mob dies.

I'm down to 14%, though, instead of a stun I toss a snare at my mob and 
take off running in tight bardic circles.. if I can get it right the mob 
will just stand there spinning in one place, 57 levels of bard gives you 
some tricks.  Periodically I manage a look and see mob still "chasing" 
me with the team pounding on it, finally the cleric tosses me another DL 
and the team gets aggro back.  Shortly after that, its dead.

So I'm chatting with the group about how that worked out when the cleric 
pulls the rug out from under us, announcing he's leaving.  Explains, 
when pressed, that we had too many tanks tanking mobs, spent his mana 
too fast.  I'd already been commenting that if we had adds again I'd 
kite them instead of trying to off tank; I'm flabbergasted that he's 
pulling out after a single try, before we have any chance to adjust 
tactics based on what we learned.  But off he goes.

Unable to locate any sort of healer, rest of group slowly splinters till 
its gone; perhaps a 10 minute group for me all told.

People are funny.

Grage, 52 Berzerk, Luclin
