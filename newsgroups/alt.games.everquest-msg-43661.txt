Jakugg, I'm glad you asked :-)

The Povar-Tarew Artisans guild focuses on tradeskills. We have two of, I
think, five 250 jewelers on Xev, Friedrich and Soulstis. Contact them; they
will give you a fair deal. If you just have questions, you can reach me
through Tvon (my own jeweler, with a skill of 150), Rosewhite or Witte (whom
you have met.)
