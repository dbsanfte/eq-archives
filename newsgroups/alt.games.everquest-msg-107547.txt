No no no.

To test if higher AC always means that you are better equiped for combat
you just need 2 characters of any level or class fighting 2 exactly
equivilent mobs (Same level class zone weapons etc.)

If AC _ALWAYS_ means that you are better equiped for combat then the one
with the higher AC will be hit less / take less damage per hit / take
less damage over time.

The OP tested this. And proved that it is not true.

The reason that so many people here have a problem with this, and have
said that he did not prove anythink is because everyone knows what he
wanted to prove almost instinctivly. After fist playing EQ for a few
hours it was obvious that the effect of Level and Defence skill were
much more important to actual behaviour in combat than the amount shown
in the AC stat.
