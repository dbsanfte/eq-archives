The logic sounds right ..but..
1. I believe the 2nd hand of the wield doent always hit..so I presume
that the 10 dps considers the average hits on the 2nd hand.
2. You picked numbers that make your point. If the mobs had 90hp, the
numbers come out the same
3. If you can melee a mob in only 3 hits, then I don't think you need
to worry about the extra 2 seconds. If it takes you much longer (40-60
seconds), then the extra 2 seconds gets lots in the noise.

So in principle you are right but I don't think it has substantive
impact. Besides, if you get to choose when to attack, then 30/30 weapon
will take that much of a bigger bite out of the mob and mean less
damage on you until he is dead. Imagine if you had  a 100/100..one hit
on the SINGLE mob and hes dead and you take no damage.
