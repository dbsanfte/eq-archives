Yeah, I thought giving them magical weapons for about 1/2 second. No way I
can afford that. I usually do ok killing them as long as I don't get 2 on
me. I bail, leaving pet to fend for itself and run like a madman if so.
Happened twice last night, once I died, once I got lucky and gated. I have a
mage but she's only 13, don't think she's capable of summoning magic stuff
just yet :)

thanks.
