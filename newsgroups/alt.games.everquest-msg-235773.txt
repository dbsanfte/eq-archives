Did the Behemoth in POI tonight (duck soup, btw, with our overkill force of
57), and after that was over the group moved to CoD to do HP. The raid
leaders announced that this was an important event for a variety of reasons
and then someone mentioned that it wasn't possible to 85% your way into
CoDb. I didn't want to divert the discussion at the time in rsay so I filed
this away for a question later, but then forgot to ask.

So, what does it mean to 85%? Does that question even make sense?
