Oh, its *easy* to create an alt newsgroup. When, uh, that Grateful Dead guy
(I'm drawing a blank) died, someone created a couple hundred newsgroups with
names that, when looked at in a list, spelled out his name banner-style.
Good luck posting to those newsgroups though, they didnt last very long.
Heck, I dont even show any of the newsgroups you listed on my newsserver.

The tricky part is keeping the newsgroup from being deleted, and convincing
system admins to carry your new newsgroup. Some operators will send a delete
request automatically if the newsgroup wasnt discussed and approved in
alt.config. That happened pretty fast with the Grateful Dead guy memorial.
But if you get that far, its usually not so hard to get admins to carry the
newsgroup if it generates any traffic.
