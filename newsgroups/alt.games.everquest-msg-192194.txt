It has to do all the damage to take 33%, if it only does 50% it
takes 16%.

50% - if a charmed pet is doing 50% of the damage to your
mobs, then you'd need to kill 80% as many mobs without it
simply to get the same xp.  Let's see here, 80% of the kills
per hour with only 50% of the DPS - ummmmmm, not bloody 
likely.

The guys the OP grouped with are just fucking stupid.
