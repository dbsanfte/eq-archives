Never had somebody sitting there and click a linked item while facing away
from the zonein and somehow click in?  Seen that one more than once.

But beyond the accidental ways you can zone in, you are saying that if we
are "good to go" we should continue to wait.  Sorry, but I think *that* is
pretty stupid.

It makes zero difference to wait?  As soon as you spend any time waiting,
the difference is obvious.

That would be an even better reason.  Thankfully I don't have to deal with
that (I have a decently high character on RZ and I am and have been for a
long long time extremely disgusted with the way PvP is handled and has
evolved in EQ).
