I just recently made it to 20 lvl mage, but am getting bored with just
lvling.  I started to poke around (and after going to the
magecompendium.com) and found a couple of things I could do.  I started
running into a couple of roadblocks in West Freeport and Temple of Solousk
(? -- not sure that's the right name -- in Lavastorm mountains) -- no one
will speak to me (I'm a dark elf).  Someone suggested that I shouldn't even
attempt to do anything else until I'm at least lvl 30.  Is this true?  Am I
doomed to roaming the countryside looking for blue/yellow for another month?
