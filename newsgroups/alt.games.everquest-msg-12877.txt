Have any of you delved into this skill? I'm specifically looking for
comments and info on Teir'Dal Chain Mail. I've read up on all the websites
but I'm looking for someone that has actually been able to make some of this
armor. Especially if it's imbued. What are your smithing stats if you've
actually been succesful and in how many tries did it take you?

They got rid of the reagent for creating enchanted Teir'Dal so it should be
easier to acquire all the ingredients.

If you've created ANY cultural armor for any race...I'd be much appreciated
if you could list your skill lvl and let me know how difficult it was.

Thanx
