I've read several times that weapon damage/delay means nothing for pets.
Pets have a set delay (unless hasted, etc.) and a set damage rate.
Supposedly having a weapon simply increases the chance of them getting
higher damage on their damage scale more often, meaning if they hit for a
maximum of 20, a weapon will make them more apt to do that more often.
I disagreed with that for a long time, but started paying attention to the
damage my pet does and this does seem to hold true.  So save your money and
just give them a rusty old longsword.
HOWEVER!  A skeleton wielding a Great Staff or a bog 'ol Halberd (when you
can find one) looks way too cool!
