Isnt it a SOE game too ?
They didnt manage to "stabilize" EQ1 in 8 years (Crashing while
zoning,"west bug",mobs under the surface,etc.),EQ2 is even
worse in this department.
For me its back to the roots(Diablo2,UO on a freshard) for now
until they change their mind and fix all the game stopping bugs
and for the future I wish they only implement new features
which have been thoroughly tested.
If that slows down development thats fine with me,I am sooo
tired of all this buggy crap the gaming industry offerd us in
the last decade,weird that they got through with this,probably
I have other expectations than the rest of their customers.
Maybe it has something to do with age,at C64/Atari/Amiga times
there was no internet to distribute patches and games usually
did what they were expected to. 
But compared to other industries their quality standards are
laughable,imagine a car working as reliably as a SOE game,lol.
