Very common drop off Coterie Generals in Tenebrous Mountains, these are the
middle ground Castle mobs between the yard trash and the actual named.

AC 8
+5 Str
+5 Int
+40 HPs
Wgt 3.0
All/all

You could get one solo at 60 I bet.   DMF/invis up and head to the back of
the castle where you should see a balcony, you can run onto this from the
hill behind with a little bit of practice.  One static spawn at each side
of the balcony (Centurions usually, the vampire cannon fodder) and a named
which sometimes paths through.  Kill these two and you can pick Generals
from inside this floor no problem.  Pathing is rubbish but not usually a
problem.

The Castle mobs are undead so you can slow them if you wish and/or drop
some DoTs on and let your pet finish them off although you'd probably want
to FD the named off if they arrived as they are a lot  nastier and immune
to runspeed changes.

Bazaar price on Bristlebane: under 150pp.
