Is it true that with the expansion, Plains of Power, the music system in all
of EQ was revamped from midi to Mp3? The reason I quit EQ when Luclin came
out was I upgraded to Win XP and with a sound blaster live card, the midi
music became very distorted.

I felt cheated, but I would come back in a heartbeat if the music problem
was resolved. I know I wasn't alone, because there were other post a year
and a half ago regarding the same thing.

Any response would be appreciated.
