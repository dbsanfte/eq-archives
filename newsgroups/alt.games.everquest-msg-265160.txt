The site with that ad has something to do with a C64 emulator on the PC, 
didn't see any info on getting it -or- the game though.

A PC version would be more likely to work.

I managed to get someone to email me a copy of SWOTL a few years ago, 
since I had it only on ancient 5.25's and no drive for that, some of the 
expansions I also owned came on 3.5 floppies... but I got the others 
emailed as well.  Amazing how tiny games once were, emailing them on a 
56K modem connection was no trouble at all.

Thing is, some of the old games had no way of adjusting the clock speed, 
they ran flat out as fast as they could.  You can imagine what SWOTL was 
like running roughly 100 times as fast as intended!  Fortunately there 
was a way of turning the speed down, or a hack that let me do it, I 
forget which, but it was fun times again, crappy graphics but I still 
say thats the best flight simulator -game- ever (There are certainly 
better flight simulators, but they aren't as much fun)

Nueromancer run on a 1.9gig machine instead of a C64 might be a 
little... blurred.
