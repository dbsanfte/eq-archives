Um, here in the US, the courts CAN NOT consider any facet of 
religious proscriptions to his withholding the feedings on the 
grounds that the church will excommunicate the hubby for 
committing a mortal [or even a venial sin of whacking off]. Sin 
has jack shit to do with the law in this country. We have a 
separation of church and state. The amorphus entity known as 
Blind Justice *can not* use religion as any part of the 
decisionmaking process because they are forbidden to.

Now if they can find just cause to prevent him from withholding 
nutrition such as some form of brain activity demonstrating 
thought and a possibility that with support and therapy she can 
regain consciousness, then I can see a reason to issue a 
restraining order to keep him from euthanizing her.  Until that 
point, he has every right according to law to pop her balloon, 
and freely be excommuicated by the church, and ostracized by her 
family and friends. As much as I believe he did cap her, the 
court could not find him guilty from the evidence as presented.

And FWIW, I happen to have a living will and all this sort of 
stuff is covered. Every responsible person hitting the age of 18 
should write a will and living will to cover this possibility. 
Heck, with as few goods and chattel possessions as the average 18 
year old has, the cost of making a will should be minimal.
