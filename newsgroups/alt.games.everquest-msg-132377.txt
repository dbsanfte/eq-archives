I am now at 181 in jewelcraft and getting skill points is damn slow. I am
doing it "by the book," in other words doing the cheapest gem which is
nearest to the next trivial (in this case gold bars and topaz to skill 183).
My question is, does EQ reward you (with faster skill points) for trying
more challenging stuff than the very next easiest stone? Would I be more
likely to grab skill points moving up to Peridot, or whatever is next after
that?

TIA
