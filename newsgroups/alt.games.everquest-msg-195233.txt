Hunting in Nektulos they are aggressively attacking the wildlife, ks'ing 
a couple spiders from me, including other skeletons. Did they always do 
this and I just didn't notice, or is this new behavior for them? It's 
kind of cool and realistic, but at the same time a bit annoying since 
they made a point to keep guards from ks'ing so much, but it's easier to 
stay away from guards then skeletons. Maybe I'm just having bad luck today.

While on the topic of new npc behavior, does anyone know anything about 
the new merchant in front of Neriak, Kinliat Bloodwalker? I assumed he 
was supposed to be the new provisions merchant dicussed in the previous 
patch, but he still won't do business with dark elves. Been bugging it, 
but wondering if he's supposed to be there for something else and 
working as usual. Even so, it's kind of silly for a dark elf standing at 
the Neriak gates to say "You Dark Elves ruined your own land, now stay 
away from mine" or whatever that line is.

Btw, thanks for the heads-up before on the need to resize the /bug 
window. Would have taken me a while to figure that out.

Thanks,
Kris
