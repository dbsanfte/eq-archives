	No, he did not address it, he handwaved it.

	The penalties eventually imposed in UO were not enough, either.  If the
penalty for PKing had been permanent death instead of stat loss it wouldn't
have been enough either.  UO had to abandon non-consensual PvP in order to
survive.

	This dog won't hunt.  The PvP war is over.  His side lost.

	We don't need virtual worlds.  We sure as hell don't need virtual worlds
full of victims for virtual serial killers to hunt down.

	I loved this line: "EQ clones are starting to fail".  REALLY?  Which ones
are these?  I know of only one MMOG to actually fail (Motor City Online), and
two that are foundering (TSO and AC2).  AC2 is the only one of the three that
could be called an EQ clone.

	Another quote from the page:

|Dionysis: Why do you think so many people dislike PVP?

|Azaroth: Because they either got PKed once and decided that any kind of a challenge is 
|just not for them, or because they've only played EQesque games (or UO after 2000) and 
|have had their opinions formed by listening to the people who got PKed once and decided 
|that any kind of a challenge is just not for them.

	No, we don't like PvP because muds are a LOUSY PvP VENUE.  The point of
competetive gaming is that it is supposed to be FAIR.  PvP in muds is almost
never fair, because only an idiot will seek out fair fights.  There is no
challenge whatsoever in whacking someone who just won a tough fight with a
monster by the skin of his teeth, or bringing six friends to gang lumberjacks
and miners, but there are no shortage of cretins who will do these things all
day long.  The idea that "anti-PKs" are going to safeguard areas is a
joke...that's not a game any more, that's a job, and one with negative
compensation.  I know, I was one.

	Bah, what's the use.  This is just another complaint by d3wdz that no one
wants to live in their world any more.  Free clue, guys, it's because your
world sucks ass.
