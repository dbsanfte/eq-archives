My advice, it keep playing that druid. You in Rivervale so you have
infravision, very handy for a first character.

Also, it is *your* world. You get to do what you want. If you want to
explore the whole city do it! There are several quests in there that are a
good start for questing.

If you want to go out and hunt you can. Pick up that newbie club and start
whacking stuff out front of the city gates in Misty Thicket. Try to stay
close to the guards that if things go bad you can run back to them. They
will kill the monster, you won't get any exp or loot, but you will live.
Later, when no guards are around, and oyu might be afraid of dying. Fight
close to a zone line. If things go bad, zone and you will be saved.

Actually, I envy you. You get to see a game with three years of more
development, ad with brand new eyes.

Enjoy!
