just count the topdots together. Lucy has the damage per tick noted IIRC or
otherwise the duration so you can calculate it yourself.
just don't make the mistake that damage per tick is NOT damage per second
:).

For a necro I'm pretty sure around 300 dps was the max including
pet/neurotoxin/dots/aa skills but a necro can sustain it longer then a
wizard (~550 dps) or mage (~450 dps). Note this is including all fancy aa's
like wake the dead, minipets, average % crits and best focus items / gear in
the game. Pure DoT dps for a necro was around 100 dps IIRC.
