    I don't like it, and I'm stuck with it on my hat. Infravision doesn't
give a reddish tint, whereas ultravision does give a bluish tint. Having
said that, my big worry about getting a hat with UV (that everything would
be blue) turned out to be unfounded. It seems like it only switches on in
low light conditions, where it does give a clearer (if bluer) form of
vision.
