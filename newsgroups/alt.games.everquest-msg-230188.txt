There's far less of them than there are slashers for rangers. It's a
wash.

I'll worry about blunt when I get a blunt. I doubt I ever will.

It's not 5 points. It's 120 points. Your way just spreads the time out
rather than one block. It's pretty simple math, I'm surprised you
would miss it.

No. It will still take the four hours. You don't do it once, you have
to do it every level.

I don't work to avoid it at all. That's the beauty of it.

Meanwhile you've spent significant time basically being powerleveled
because you're contributing nothing to the group with your gimpy
weapon practicing a skill you won't use until - IF - you get a decent
weapon in that skill bracket. 

I see people who pull out bad weapons to practice skill as as bad a
player as a ranger who pulls out a bow at L30 to max that skill.
Pointless and rude. Do it on your own time.
