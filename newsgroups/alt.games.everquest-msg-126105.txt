Here's my thought:  I do lots of nice things in the game..  If I'm not busy and
someone needs ports, sows, heals, I'm there.
On the other hand, it seems alot of the  time when someone sends me a PRIVATE
TELL (when I've ignored their /oocs because I'm busy and really NOT in the mood
to be their personal grunt) I've ended up frustrated with them by the time it's
over. 
Obviously the logical solution is the just /ignore from the gitgo but that's
often hard with someone whining to you  in /tell "please please please I only
have 20 minutes til my corpse decays..." or whatever sympathy invoking speech
they have prepared...
Note that the writer didn't respond to their requests for help, they came to
HIM asking for help.
