Ok, assuming this is true, then let's see if I've got this right for my
24 wizzy. I'm currently sitting with an INT of 180. So my base mana pool
is going to be (/em does some quick shoe removal and counts...) 912. I
also have another 165 worth of +mana in items, for a grand total of
1,077.

If (as I should be able to by this weekend) I replace my current single
+2 INT earring with a pair of +5 INT earrings (net gain of 8 INT) I
would go up to 1,115.  So in order for me to do better in those slots
than bat skull earrings, I would need earrings with no INT but giving me
more than 38 mana? Why doesn't that sound right? I know there's some
nice mana items out there. Heck, one of mine has 35 on it.

Now I'm back to wondering if I should be researching and chasing down
Mana items still and just banking the INT items for later.
*sigh*.
