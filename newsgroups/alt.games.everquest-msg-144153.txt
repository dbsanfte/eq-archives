I found it annoying, not sure if I'd call it a ripoff I guess.  Lots
of other folks would tho, remember the RL silver market manipulation
10 or so years back?  iirc those guys went to jail.

I was in the market to sell some, which I eventually did once these
folks stopped playing with the market.  Lots of more naive folks
(and/or folks in a hurry) just followed the herd and sold lo.

Higher than the low price the manipulators induced, actually lower than
their final sell price (which allowed me to finally get rid of them).
