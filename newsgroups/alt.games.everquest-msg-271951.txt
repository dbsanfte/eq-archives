Nope.

There's not one word in it not true.

There are solo regions in the outdoor zones, and solo quests to take
advantage of them. The wholesaler tasks assigned by NPCs (the 'jobs')
are all soloable. 

There are:
Solo quests (with more coming).
Solo jobs assigned by NPCs.
Areas where oppoenents can be fought solo.

All of those things exist. Every last one of them. Nothing in the
paragraph is a lie.

What it doesn't say -- and which people like to imagine it says -- is
'You will be able to experience the entire game if you solo'. You
won't. It says there's "significant content" -- not "ALL content".
('significant' is, of course, a weasel word, with no fixed meaning,
but I've seen plenty of solo areas in Antonica and the Steppes, and
ditto solo quests)
