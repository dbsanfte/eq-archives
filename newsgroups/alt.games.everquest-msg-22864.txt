Hehe, have 145 skill now, so all i can use are the excellent pelts, the normal pelts are
trivial at around 122. But plan to make them after if finished with Wu armor.
Would be stupid to make any cultural before. Wu armor at least only take a few hours of
hunting spiders, and around 12pp pr try, cultural armor take 66pp pr try, if i buy the
pelts at 15pp each. Morning Dew and Oak Bark is not included in that price.
Since the imbued Cultural are trivial at around 180 or so, its the cheapest to train on
from Wus 158 untill its trivial, then its Velious armor which should be REALLY expensive
to make.

Dont make quivers at 81 skill, youll loose too many pelts, make Studded armor untilll
108, then quivers till 115 skill.
