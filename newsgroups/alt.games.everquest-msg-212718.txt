Considering the site can easily be considered commercial (It exists
primarily for making money for the site admin. The dippy excuse for a
"game" is just a hook to get people to come in and look at his banners
and pop-ups), I'd say it is spam. I'd also be willing to wager a
Google search will turn this post up in several other newsgroups, but
I'm too lazy at the moment to do a search myself.
