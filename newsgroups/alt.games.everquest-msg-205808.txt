Not really. It's the classic powergamer mindset that by reaching level "x",
by obtaining all of the "best" equipment, etc. etc., that they can "win" or
"beat" the game. And preferably, it's best to find one zone, or a succession
of "best" zones that allow them to do so in the shortest possible time, as
in my experience they tend to have very short attention spans and tend to
get very irritated if 5 minutes pass without a kill.

They've never understood that EQ cannot be "won" or "beaten", and that the
fun is in the journey rather than the destination. And, they probably never
will. Best not to let it bother you.
