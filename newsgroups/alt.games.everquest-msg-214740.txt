Assuming these people *are* friends. Your tag isn't going to affect 
getting help on quests, grouping, and what have you. Unless your friends 
guild also has a policy of not helping non-guilded friends... but then 
if your friends belong to guild like that... they aren't interested in 
being friends.

So some guilds have another policy that is pretty much bullshit. A 
competent experienced exguildie would be an asset on any raid, if he was 
interested in coming.

Gee so I should stay in the guild because it puts me one bump over 
non-members for about to rot no-drops. With friends like that...

1) BULLSHIT! I NEVER SAID THEIRE SHOULD BE NO ADVANTAGES FOR GOOD 
ATTENDANCE. I said, the advantages for good attendance should be 
proportional to the attendance. Stop putting words in my mouth.

2) "Suddenly"??? Lot of people in a guild disagree with many of the 
policies. They still join. That doesn't mean they agree with those 
policies. I for example, am not even in an attendance guild, and I've 
got pre-emptive issues with it, if I were to join an attendance guild to 
be with friends I would continue to have issues with it, and if my 
attendance dropped below the requirement ... yup ... I would still have 
issues with it.

Oh give me a break. Now your suggesting preserve a stupid rule because 
other people agreed to it and had to endure hardship because of it.

Might as well advocate keeping hazing rituals because it wouldn't be 
fair to everyone else who made an effort to endure them.

I'm sorry, but that line of logic is absurd.

Ergo...Homosexuality should be returned to a mental disease status, and 
gays should be committed... its the only way to be fair to all those 
poor gays who were committed back while homosexuality was considered a 
type of insanity. (Regardless of how stupid the idea is, its the only 
way to be fair to all those gays who made an extra effort to stay in the 
closet back then...)

I infinitely prefer changing the rules so that they make sense for all 
members, not just the guys on top. Why do you repeatedly suggest that I 
somehow *want* my friends out of a guild.

Yeah we covered that.

Yet again. We covered that. Leaving a stupid unfair policy in place just 
so as not to make it 'unfair' to people who endured it is retarded.

Who is really fine when their group of friends decides they aren't good 
enough to be considered a full-friend. Cliques in gradeschool are on par 
with this level of maturity...

Do you live in somesort of static universe where the 'rules' are handed 
down from above. And you must determine the course of your life by 
finding your way through them?

You seem to attach a great deal of importance to the idea that once a 
bunch of people had to endure a rule, even a stupid one, it shouldn't be 
changed because that wouldn't be fair.

It must really burn you up when somebody changes the rules... I mean 
here you had to work within them and life was so hard on you, and this 
other person comes along and says ... "Hey this is colossally stupid, it 
should be like this, finds a few people to agree with him, and changes 
it..." How unfair to you.
