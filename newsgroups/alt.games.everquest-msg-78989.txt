If you wish to use the same login name etc just cancel the account at the
login screen. You will then be able to continue playing the game until your
subscription period runs out. When it runs out just enter your new card
details. You will know when it has run out as it wont let you play ;)

If you want to set up a new account, you need a new key too. And cancel the
old account else they will continue billing it. Then make a new account.
