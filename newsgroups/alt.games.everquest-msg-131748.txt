Two Raging Drolvargs as I recall, at level 49 I think.  I had just sowed my
self after zoning in.  Was running along with a ranger friend, got a couple
of Drolvargs on me, decided to root one, and heal the ranger as she dealt
with the second one.  Hit F8, cast root.  F8 sucks, it works like maybe 50%
of the time now.  There were two mobs beating on me, right in front of me,
you would think that it could find a mob somewhere near me to target.  So,
there I was rooted, two Ragers hitting me, I was beat down to low health
aggro before the ranger even had a chance to taunt one off me, knocked
unconsious, then, amazingly, healed back out of unconsiosnous by the Ranger,
and then killed. 1200 to 1500 hp just doesn't go very far.  The sad thing
is, that at level 49, I could have soloed them both without taking a hit.
