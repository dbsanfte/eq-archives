Have you ever had a Voodo card in your machine?

If so, you are fubared for using Detonator drivers. Why? Don't ask me,
but until every trace of the voodoo drivers is gone you would be
guaranteed to have problems with the Detonators.

If not, I'd have to know a lot more about your system, including CPU,
BIOS type and revision, the BIOS of your video card (often nVidia-based
cards need a BIOS update right out of the box, as with my brand new
GeForce2 MX400).
