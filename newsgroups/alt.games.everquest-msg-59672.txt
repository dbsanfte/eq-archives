  You've missed the point, of course.  The "SO WHAT" applies to the fact
that yes, not-fun things will sometimes happen.  But unless it is *always*
not fun, as long as what fun there is outweighs the not-fun, who cares?
  Throwing a gutter ball when you're bowling isn't fun.  There will ALWAYS
be gutter balls.  I don't care for them.  Furthermore, there will ALWAYS be
people better at bowling than I am.  People who join leagues and practice
three times a week and own their own (bowling) shoes.
  This doesn't mean bowling in itself isn't fun, does it?  I just don't put
myself in a position where I'm going to get r0x0red by Sir Chuck the Albion
League Bowler unless I actually think I have my Consecutive Strikes and
Cover 7-10 Split skills spec'd enough to actually take him.  Or my Summon
Bowling Ally spell is high enough to get me Parker Bohn III (apparently a
good bowler, I got the name from Google), who can then take Sir Chuck apart
for me.  Or maybe Parker is head of my guild and will try to keep me alive
in the Brunswick Frontier Lands.  Etc, etc.
  Have fun, don't have fun.  It's almost always more about the attitude of
the person playing than the game itself.
