I knew Drake wasn't really referring to Povar, but decided to feign
ignorance for a couple reasons.  First, because Drake quoted the OP talking
about Povar, not about the Legends server.  Second, because the OP does not
ever say he went to Legends FOR the good CS.  He mentioned it as one of
several things he liked about Legends.  It's one thing that pisses me off,
people that attack someone over an assertion that was never actually made.
It's a very stupid debating trick, and it makes the person using it look
like an ass.
