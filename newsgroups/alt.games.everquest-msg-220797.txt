I read some of this out of boredom more than anything else.  I think 
the word "leapfrogging" was probably not the right one.

I've heard the phrase "cock-blocking" used before and this appears to 
be more accurate here.

Note that not only did CiH not have the numbers, they did not need the 
kill.  They were only interested in blocking another guild, they 
already had the flags and the loot upgrades were pretty minor from what 
I understood from the long drawn out messageboard bitch.

As a player who is just starting to get to the point of joining a guild 
and progressing, it did give me an interesting insight into the dirtier 
part of the game.
