Great ;-)

Always wanted to feel like a newbie (or even worse) with my stats again
.... Is there someone designing the game with sense anymore ? And I
dont think it has to be that way, there are people not in time yet ...
with normal gear ... and even timepeople might get problems here ...
think the mobs wont hit for less because of this ....

Have fun in game

Christian
