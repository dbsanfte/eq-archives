I was having the same problem, and switched to my Cleric as my new
main - sh ecan now solo Blue >> mobs with a high degree of success,
and groups of ordinary Blues. 

As someone state elsewhere, you'd be better off starting a group, as
Clerics have a much easier time stating groups.  Also, remember for a
lot of mobs, you can get away with a group of 3, if you're careful to
watch for additional mobs.  You don't need a full group of 6 all the
time.
