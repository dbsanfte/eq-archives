I always keep app IVs in stock on my trader, and it is very rare indeed 
that I actually sell any, even though I keep them priced below anyone else.      
I hate doing anything with my sage, because I know the spells I make are 
going to be sitting on my trader taking up space for a very long time, 
instead, I just keep on working on my provisioner, or go out and adventure.  
The only spells I make anymore are for guildies and friends.
