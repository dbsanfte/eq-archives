What's to be confused about?
When have people in general ever behaved other than selfishly
regarding anything even remotely important to them?
Do you think it's an accident that there are so many lawyers out
there fucking up everything in life even remotely accessible to
a lawsuit?

The above is, perhaps, slightly exagerated.  But given the relative
anonymity of members of the EQ player "community" I'd be surprised
to have heard you report anything else.  Most everybody I've known
has been more than willing to blatantly favor self-interest over
group-interest anytime they lack a personal connection to members
of the group.  This is as true of, to use an RL example, tax-cut
whiners as it is of tax-the-rich ranters.
