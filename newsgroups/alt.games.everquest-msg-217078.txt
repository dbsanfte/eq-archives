Only done one adventure without a Cleric and though we won easily the
Druid who was doing most of the healing died twice meaning the Necro
in group used up two EEs rezzing him.  This made me kind of
uncomfortable when it came to split the cash as they are still quite
spendy items on my server and despite giving him a chunk of extra coin
I'm sure he ended up out of pocket.

For that reason alone I always like to take a Cleric unless absolutely
necessary.
