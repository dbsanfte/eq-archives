Well I decided to have a try at spell research with my necro as he's now old
enough to cope with such things but I should have left it alone and just
bought the dang spells.

On the new tradeskill UI for spell research there's a button marked "right
click to open" or something similar ... clicked on it to see what would
happen and nothing did ... but now when I open my spell research book I only
get the old style layout without the known recipes.

Does anyone know where the setting is to re-enable the new style interface?
... I've had a quick look in the UI files but I can't see anything that
looks like it would be the setting for this.
