I ran into a guy the other day who liked my
executioners axe and said that he had some weapons
that he would trade.  We discussed the trade for a
while and settled on his runic carver for my
exectioners axe.  I felt pretty good about the
trade and we made the exchange.

A few minutes later he says "Hey I can't use this
axe".  I told him that I would trade him back if
that's what he wanted and we traded back again.  I
really liked that runic carver.  Would it have
been wrong for me to ignore him or say "sorry, the
trade has been made".  I guess I was going by the
rule of treating people like you would want to be
treated yourself.
