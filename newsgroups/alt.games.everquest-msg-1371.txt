I have always found Verant's paid customer service team to be very helpful,
knowledgable, and courtious. (sp).  Many of the complaints you mention are
made about the ingame GMs.  Of course I've had a number of good experiences
with them, as well... and one very bad one.

The fundamental problems with their GM system is that these guys aren't
paid.  They are volunteers receiving only free accounts for their trouble.
They are never interviewed live and are accepted into the program based on
how well and how articulately they answer a long series of fill in the blank
questions on their guide-app website.  Their initial briefing is done via
IRC and they spend one month with limited powers as apprentice guides and
are then given full guide status, and that's it.

This system does allow for a lot of potential abuse, as you can imagine.

Interestingly enough, I logged my bad experience with the GM and posted it
here.  I was then incesently flamed as being a crybaby and watnot, but
sending an e-mail containing the same log to Verant's paid customer support
team got the problem rectified and a sincere apology.

Their customer support staff is good, and most of their GMs are helpful as
well (though VERY limited in what they are able to do... moreso than you
probably think).  But they have a program that can easily be abused and some
bad apples slip through.

Best Regards
