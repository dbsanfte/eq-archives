    One of my guildmates has an issue like this. Do you sometimes get 1017
errors when you try to come back? If you have his situation, then the
solution (given to him by a GM) is actually pretty funny. Strip off all your
clothes before you zone. No, really. It cracks us up watching our
necromancer strip naked before he goes anywhere, but it stops his crashes.
Here's hoping your problem is fixed soon.
