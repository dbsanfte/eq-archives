Don't be so sure about it.  You may have (and most likely did) proven that
the difference of three levels offset an AC difference of around 100 ac.
You can't be sure until you test that out.  If you want to test this, find a
combination of gear that would bring your test alt up to the ac of your
naked 52 paladin.  Now, let them both sit infront of a firebeetle, and see
which one takes more damage.  Or you can probably just transfer your 52's
gear to the test alt and don/doff it as necessary to make the AC about the
same or a little higher.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
