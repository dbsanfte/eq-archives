I believe you mean it's me that is attempting the pointless, as in
expressing an opinion that flames are not constructive posts which in turn
is taken as flame bait and I am flamed for. I don't see it as pointless as
Bizbee actually replied to my post, I don't expect him to agree with me but
he didn't "flame" me.

Reading the posts again, am I the one who is bent out of shape?

I find it odd that it is me who is considered tiresome for making a point.
In fact it seems anyone, new, that stands their ground here is in the wrong
and as such a trouble maker (or a troll) but those who incessantly flame are
accepted, forgiven or even admired.
What a nice clique you seem to have here.
