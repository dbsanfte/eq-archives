EverQuest Expands Its Realm
By Michael Singer 


  

The online game world of EverQuest is out of this world - literally. 

Sony Online Entertainment (NYSE:SNE), which produces the game, Monday
says it is releasing EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin at retail stores
Tuesday, December 4. The sequel to the popular multiplayer game is set
on the fictional moonscape of Luclin. 

The game is sometimes known as "Ever-Crack" for its seemingly
addictive properties. Some of the more than 400,000 current registered
players say they can't wait to play it. 

"I GOTTA HAVE IT! I GOTTA...... (AHEM!), I mean, I'm going to buy it
now," says one poster on EarthWeb's SysOpt forums page. 

Sony says along with the new landscape, there are more than 27 new
adventure zones, all-new items, creatures and spells. The company says
the whole thing is supported by a complete graphic overhaul to enhance
gameplay. 

Significantly, players will be able to work with rideable horses and
interact with a new catlike warrior race called the Vah Shir. 

"Luclin is the most ambitious addition yet to a collection of
massively multiplayer experiences that combine to form one of the
greatest online games of all time," says Sony Online Entertainment
Vice President of Marketing Scott McDaniel. "There is an astonishing
amount of new content added in this expansion and we're confident
gamers everywhere will find Luclin truly amazing." 

The CD-ROM includes a complete upgrade to all textures throughout the
original world of Norrath and all previous expansions. 

However, players will need to have purchased the original EverQuest or
EverQuest:Trilogy to explore the moon of Luclin. 

The Station, San Diego-based Sony's official provider of EverQuest
will again be supplying the software updates and news about the game,
message boards and other community features, as well as an easy-to-use
billing system for EverQuest's monthly subscription fee.
