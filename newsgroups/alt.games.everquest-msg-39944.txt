I completely have to disagree with this for one simple reason...
Cerfnet.

I can't remember how many times back when EQ was new and
I would be able to log on and see1000 people on my server at
a peak time when it should have been around 1800-2000.
Obviously people could play.  If I could connect to the login
server to see this, obviously the problem was not with my own
ISP.  If there are 2000 at peak and I can't log on, I can call
my ISP with the data.  If there are 11 people on at peak and
a guide in chat tells me it's my ISP, I can at least know I'm
getting a CS runaround.

I do believe the numbers are important.  With 600 people on
the server, I won't even log in my rogue...too little chance of
finding a group near where I am.  With 2200 on, I'll log on with
her and have a blast.
