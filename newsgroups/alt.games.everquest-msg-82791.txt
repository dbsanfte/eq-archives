It the year or so that I've played the game, I've never had a caster get to
35.  In the next week or so, that should change.

I keep hearing folks talk about medding without the book at 35 ... will that
affect my macros?  I currently have a medding macro for my druid that's
pretty simple:

/doability 1 (Sense Heading)
/doability 2 (Forage)
/book on

Will something need to change with that at 35?  And info would be
appreciated! :-)

TIA,
Crash
