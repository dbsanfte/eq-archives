And my statement was that both those sentances could be applied by
either side. What makes YOUR definition of "good" and "evil" "more
right" than the Al Qaeda's? Simply the fact that more people agree
with you? You define the word one way, and claim it to be true by
simple statement. You use a word different from others, how are you
"more right" than they are?

What context would have changed it? None.
