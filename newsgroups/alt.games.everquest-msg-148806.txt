Using your logic, money is just bits data if paid electronically via 
bank transfer or credit card, just more magnetic on off sequences. 
Should be no problem to continue to bill you after you cancel your 
account since its just bits of data, right?

You sound like the punk kid who when caught stealing from a store says 
what's the big deal, its just stuff or the bastage who killed his wife 
and told  the cops what's the big deal, its just a woman.  It ain't just 
anything, it is what it is.  You expect VI to perform charitable 
services and baby-sit your data when you are too cheap to pay them you 
got a lot of disappointment in your life, nobody rides for free.

I officially don't give a rat's patoot what makes you sick and I rather 
doubt any one else but your mamma does, so tell your problems to her. 
Recognizing a company's right to determine what services they will 
provide for free is far different from ass kissing.  Maybe if you spent 
a bit more time working to earn money and a bit less bitching about what 
you can't get for free you'd sound like less of a whiner.

That being said, I just spoke to a friend who came back to the game 
after more than six months to find all her chars and all her equipment. 
  I have serious doubts as to the trollish nature of the OP as this is 
the first I've heard of a deactivated account wipe, ever.
