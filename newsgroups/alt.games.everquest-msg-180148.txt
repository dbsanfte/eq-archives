Been there seen that !

1 ) It would NEVER be God telling you to kill your self : that's Satan ( God
creates : Satan Destroy's )
2 ) Your probably been tested with isolation, insanity , this "test" is to
see if you're able to handle great rejection AND keep a cool head, obviously
if you're thinking of killing your self and God's kept you around ( Amen ;-)
well done.
3 ) Take a good look around some mental hospitals some of these folks failed
the "test's" and have become expert philosophers ( in joke ) or university
lecturers ( ones with pride )
4 ) Remember the servant master balance, if you forget the poor or stop
loving or can't keep cool, you won't be able to get "upto" Apostle. And when
/ if you do get up to such a privaleged position the agression from within
the church will probably make you want to die ! I can't tell you the number
of times I've nearly let my guard down and talked on a level people are
terrified off and their fear of the unknown let's Satan in and they attack
like a dagger, best take things steady and remember God is Good, Satan is
evil, most people are terrified and have the wrong answers / conclusions.
Simplest analogy, you and some friends are standing a top of a mountain and
there is a gap, if you can jump over the gap you get a reward but if you
slip you fall to your death,1) you have to overcome their doubts as their
anti-faith reduces your ability to jump !
2) you figure it's not your ability but God that carries you over 3) God
made you limb by limb he knows whether it's possible or not so ask him
first, and make sure you can hear the right voice Lk 8v18 ( faith )

How's about this test : It's trib time, the wicked say to you take this ID
or you will die of starvation or we will kill you. In fear most would take
the ID to supposidly survive, what you have to see is this
1) Do you choose to stay amongst the oppressive wicked , or trust the second
you die you goto heaven to be with a loving Jesus, a second of pain of the
sword and then eternal paradise

go figure .... join the club, it can be really lonely though, most folk
think your insain, praise God for HIS love

Last night my friend caught me out, he's away on holiday and said "I've
bought a first aid kit" , I said "very sensible" = WRONG response . This
shows lack of faith in God's ability to heal ( hence this fellow has not got
the faith to be healed when needed and relys on the world :-(
and I should have witnessed God's healing ability, but he would have none of
it even though a saved Christian he agressively defended his pastors believe
that the gifts went away in the first century ( this is defending
anti-faith ) ... and on and it goes .... but Romans 14v1 !!! If the path to
getting saved is narrow imaging how narrow being Apostle is, those guys are
worthy of much love.

And another thing ... how many times do you see a pastor "have a go" at
"his" flock ... sad ...
