Cheapskates?  Excuse me?  Where do you get off saying such a thing?  Both my
husband and I work very hard to make a good living, and we live comfortably.
Unfortunately, we have more important things, like groceries to feed us and
our children, a car payment, a mortgage, and the dozens of bills that come
along with owning and maintaining a house to worry about.  So, in all, sure,
I guess you can call us cheapskates, if you wanna factor in the fact that we
don't feel like forking over an extra 50 bucks for the game (w/luclin) and
$25.90/mo verses 12.95/mo.

I don't know about you, but there ARE people that only have a small bit of
extra money a month to spend on luxuries such as a game like this.   I
advise that next time, you get your facts straight before you make
assumptions.

Respectfully,
Nicole and Matt Amberg.
