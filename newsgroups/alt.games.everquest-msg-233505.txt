All great advice and I'd like to add one more tip if you group with
enchanters fairly regularly. Keep your lowest stun memorized, and if you
see your chanter having trouble with a mob, hit it with a fast stun.
This can often help more than just tossing a heal on the chanter as if
it sticks it will give him enough time to cast a mez, and if it's
resisted, you may agro it on you, again giving him a chance to mez it.
