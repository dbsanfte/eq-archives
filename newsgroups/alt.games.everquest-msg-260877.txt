For those of you who have been to cold area and noticed you can see
your own breath (or anyone else, even NPC's), it's a neat addition
today.  But I noticed my pet didn't breath right.  It appears as if
the tiger is breathing through the forehead rather than the mouth. 

BTW my character is Beastlord.  I haven't seen any other pet yet so I
don't know if they breath right or not.  Can someone check if the
undead breaths? :)
