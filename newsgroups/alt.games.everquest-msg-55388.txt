Your druid... I would head to North Karana. Your goal at this point is to
ding 19 as fast as you can to get your Ring spells. Before going anywhere
though, stop off in West Commons at the druid ring and buy your Ring Of
Commons -now-, and keep it on you. The moment you ding 19 you can plop
down, scribe the spell, and zip back to commons and pick up the rest of
your ring spells. (of course, one of those being Ring of (N)Karana is just
gravy) NK is the single best place to go when getting ready to ding 19.
Guard Shilster will be an even con to you, but he's absolutely fabulous
exp, always drops a Qyenos Kite Shield worth about 2plat, and he's "evil"
so it's perfectly OK to waste him over and over again. He harm touchs for
170 points of damage, but there's a laughably easy way to keep him from
using it on you. Charm a green lioness or lion and sic the pet on
Shilster. He'll melee it for a round or two, giving you time to snare him,
and then he HTs the lion into nothingness. (So no worries about a charm
break, the lion isn't going to last but a few seconds anyway - it's there
strictly to take the HT Shilster tosses out because at 18 170hp is no
joke) Once his HT is going it's down to standard kiting.. DoT,DD, run,
repeat. He's on a long clock sometimes (about 20 mins or so) which is
plenty of time for you to med up and go kite a scythe or borer beetle. You
should ding 19 in about 3 hours played.

Once you ding 19, Shilster is still your primary target, but now you can
bind yourself in the tower in North Qyenos, kill Shilster, Gate to NQ to
turn in his helm for more exp, then Ring yourself right back to Karana.

Then of course, at 20, you'll become even more of an exp machine because
Track is now available. W00t!
