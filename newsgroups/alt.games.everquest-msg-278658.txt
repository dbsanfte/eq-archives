Hit MPG as much as possible until level 69, then hit RSS as much as 
possible.  Two shaman in my guild outfitted themselves with all of their 
69/70 runes by doing just that.  It does help a lot if you have regular 
friends to play with, otherwise, I will admit, getting an RSS group is 
nigh on impossible these days.  MPG is not hard to get a group for 
though, and 69 and 70 runes can drop their, albeit rarely.

I still have none of my GoD spells, it is just about impossible to get a 
group for any GoD zone now, it's way too old now.

Overall, I do agree, the drop rate is pretty absurd at this point.
