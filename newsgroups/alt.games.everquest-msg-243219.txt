Trivial to do with the new UI.  Make Minotaur Hero's Brews up to 248.

Kind of a pain, do the various poison vials until they all trivial.

Easiest, make woven Mandrake, then Picnic Baskets up to 82 or so.  After 
that, it starts to get painful.  You will have to farm.

Go to www.eqtraders.com, do the next thing that is not trivial to you, 
keep doing that through Banded armor, after that, time to farm.

Easiest, spend training points, cheapest, go fish.

See smithing, you can get to 202 doing arrows with vendor purchased 
ingredients, after that, you can make bows with vendor purchased 
materials (very expensive), or you can farm for acrylia arrows (very 
cheap).
