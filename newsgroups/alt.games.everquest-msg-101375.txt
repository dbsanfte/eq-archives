One time I managed to "miss" the zone line running into Kurn's,
and ended up inside the FoB "tower" itself.  I got to see that
"orb" up close and personal, and have a few screenshots of
it around here someplace.

As near as I could tell, it didn't actually do anything.

But it certainly made clear just how much bigger Kurn's
Tower (zone) is on the "inside" than it is from the "outside".  :-)
