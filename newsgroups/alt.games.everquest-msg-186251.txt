Bristlebane has three elemental guilds with a fourth set to attempt
Sol Ro shortly if they haven't already as they recently killed TZ and
VZ - I'm assuming they cannot get a shot at RZ and are working on
what they can.  My own guild are finishing the various PoP flags in
tandem with following the traditional HoT -> NToV -> Ssra -> VT loot
route.

The top guild (gear wise if nothing else) now only has the Coirnav
event as yet unbeaten the last I heard.
