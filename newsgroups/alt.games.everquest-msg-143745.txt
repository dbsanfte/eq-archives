Or, alternatively, special sentencing guidelines are needed.
You don't have to convict someone of a hate crime to punish
them for a criminal act.  And, as I said, I've no issue with
that type of legal protection.

No, that's just a reason for sentence recommendations.  The
idea that you have to convict someone of a special crime in
order to punish them more severely just isn't accurate in the
US legal system.

Nope, you can think all you want about committing a crime.  You
just can't commit it.  There's plenty of people who think about
crimes who get rewarded by society for doing so:  any popular
murder mystery writer, for instance.

Not under a separate 'hate crime' law which allows convictions.
Those do result in convictions based on thoughts, not actions.
The thoughts are a *requirement* to be charged with the crime.
But those thoughts are perfectly legal and, in fact, guaranteed
by the Constitution.  You end up with people being charged because
of legal activities taken in conjunction with an illegal act.  It's
the logical equivilent of charging someone with traffic violations
because they drove a car to a bank robbery.

An example, then:

Being a member of some fringe groups is generally accepted as bad.
A card-carrying member of the KKK, for instance, might not be
guilty of any crime.  With circumstantial evidence, it's entirely
possible for that person to be convicted because of a *legal*
affiliation and *legal* thoughts because the prosecutors are able
to convince the jury the person is "bad" and PROBABLY guilty.  The
prosecutors try to do that today.  It becomes a lot easier when
that person's thoughts become part-and-partial of the specific crime.

A defense lawyer can argue, for instance, that membership in the KKK
is irrelevant and prejudicial in a trial of someone accused of killing
an African-American.  That argument can NOT be made successfully once
the prosecution has the ability to charge the person with a hate crime
because the membership goes to motive *whether it actually does or not.*
It's not a reach for a jury to go from "that guy's a real SOB" to "that
guy's a real SOB and is probably guilty" without the evidence to back
it up.

So, for an example:  a KKK member shoots and kills an African-American
on his property, breaking into his house.  That's a pretty clear case
of a crime which isn't a hate crime, correct?  But, if the prosecution
wants a conviction, they can charge the hate crime and muddy the waters
with the KKK membership, etc.   That person, I'd argue, is a LOT more
likely to be convicted than a person in the exact same situation who
has no prejudicial history.

As I've said, I don't mind sentencing guidelines based on hate crime
criteria.  But let them *convict* on the raw facts, then hang 'em
because they're a bigot.  It's a lot safer, IMO, given natural desires
by prosecutors for convictions, even on marginal evidence.
