Have you tried the program JWrite?

http://www.mwasoftware.co.uk/jwrite.htm

When you mentioned a large text file this came to mind. I hadn't used it in a 
long time so I grabbed it to make sure it was what I was thinking of. How big is 
the text log file you have? The larget text file I have is only 15MB here, but I 
tested it with Notepad and JWrite. Notepad took around 18-20 seconds to open the 
file while JWrite opened the file instantly (I double-clicked to open it and 
there was no delay).

Just a thought.
