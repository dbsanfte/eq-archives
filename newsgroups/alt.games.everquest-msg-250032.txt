A lot of people forget /camp, as in just camping to the character
select, as a good means of going AFK. If you just camp to the
character select screen, which is all /camp does, then it takes you a
millisecond to get back in game where you were. It takes no where near
as much time as logging all the way back in does.

If you are going AFK for a rather long time, it makes sense. For
example, my druid and cleric were camping that level 44 cleric buff
thing that is like a mini aegeo, in LOY. The skeleton PH thing was up
maybe every 17 minutes or so and I did not feel like going AFK into
the other room to watch TV all that time wondering if the one other
person in the zone might suddenly train 75 undead to where I am. 

So all I did was have the druid on, then camp to character select.
Then I got in about 17 minutes or more later, during a commercial,
killed the PH who was up, then /camp again. Repeat. Finally, in what
was about a leisurely 90 minutes of watching TV, the person for the
turn in was up and my druid got on during a commercial then my cleric
logged in from its character select screen as well and got the spell.
Then both camped again. Then when I was done watching tv I got them
back on to play with the new spell.
