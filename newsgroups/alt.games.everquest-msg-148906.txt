The fact that you "like" that paragraph speaks

Oh, sure, because socialists are renowned for
their honesty and objectivity, right?

This is about what I'd expect from a group
calling themselves "World Socialists" -- a blatantly
transparent slander attempt using lies and
gross misrepresentations.

That is *NOT* what the "official account" asserts
happened.  Not even close.

The "World Socialists" attempt to try to paint
the US findings as absurdly unbelievable by
making up an enormously distorted "summary"
of the report which bears no resemblance
to what the report *actually* says.

Such "big lie" techniques in an attempt to
discredit an opponent are nauseatingly
disgusting to anyone who values honesty or
truth, but are monotonously typical for
Socialists and their ilk.

The US report does not assert anything as
absurd as the claim that an AA gun was
"planted in the midst of a wedding party",
nor that an AA gun was removed "in the midst
of the mayhem".  The Socialists need to try
some less transparent lies.

Instead, a location somewhere in the village
was involved in AA fire, which is hardly the
same as "in the midst of a wedding party'.

And the offending AA gun need hardly be
removed "in the midst of the mayhem" --
the first coalition troops to arrive on site
arrived *hours* after the AC-130 fire ceased, and
the investigation team arrived *weeks* later.

Nor, contrary to earlier implications,
were the US forces simply firing recklessly
in response to small arms fire from a wedding
(or to hear some people tell it, simply at
random).  The report makes clear that actual
AA fire from the area had been repeatedly
observed and verified, including on the night
of the incident:

# The Deh Rawod area of Afghanistan is considered
# the �home� of the Taliban and remains an area
# where the Taliban enjoy popular support. The
# extended families of both Mullah Mohammed Omar,
# the former �Supreme Leader� of the Taliban, and
# Mullah Berader, the former �Senior Military Commander�
# of the Taliban, reside in the area.
#
# Coalition aircraft have regularly been the target
# of hostile fire from the Deh Rawod area. While
# ineffective, the fire was clearly intentional
# and directed toward coalition forces. Two weeks
# prior to Operation FULL THROTTLE (OFT), covert
# reconnaissance of the area was conducted. Gunfire
# from various caliber weapons was observed throughout
# the day and at night, including mortars and AAA
# fire. The Deh Rawod area appeared to support enemy
# military training.
#
# OFT was intended to deny Deh Rawod as an enemy
# sanctuary. Afghan forces were involved the
# execution of the mission.
#
# Two days before the incident, additional reconnaissance
# teams were inserted into positions where they
# could observe the specific objectives and the
# approaches that coalition ground and airborne
# forces would take to execute their missions.
# Hostile fire was directed at coalition helicopters
# conducting these insertions, forcing at least one
# to land at an alternate site. During this period
# of increased and focused reconnaissance, every time
# a coalition aircraft appeared overhead or could be
# heard at night, ground fire was directed at it. These
# fires were traced back to their source locations on
# the ground. From the nature and characteristics of
# the fires, it was clear that these were AAA and not
# small arms.
#
# Several compounds in the Deh Rawod area were positively
# identified as sources of this AAA fire. AAA fire had
# emanated from these compounds on repeated occasions
# over the previous two days and the source of the fires
# did not change. In all cases, the locations of these
# compounds were such that they could range and threaten
# coalition ground and airborne forces that were to execute
# OFT. On-call close air support assets were assigned to
# OFT to counter these threats should AAA in those compounds
# become active in the moments immediately preceding the
# introduction of coalition forces into the area.
#
# As coalition ground and airborne forces approached
# the area, fire erupted from some of the compounds.
# By firing, these AAA batteries established that
# they were manned, armed and operational. Their
# proximity to the objectives, landing zones and
# blocking positions made them a threat to inbound
# coalition forces. Consequently, these sites were
# valid targets and AC-130 aircraft were directed
# toward them.
#
# Significant efforts were expended to ensure only the
# compounds that were the sources of fire were targeted.
# At the first targeted compound, the apparent location
# of most of the deaths and injuries, AAA fire was directed
# at the AC-130 as it approached. At one location, however,
# the AC-130 arrived at a target and found it to be �cold�
# and elected not to strike it.

The conclusion of the report is entirely fair:

# While the coalition regrets the loss of innocent lives,
# the responsibility for that loss rests with those that
# knowingly directed hostile fire at coalition forces.
# The operators of those weapons elected to place them
# in civilian communities and elected to fire them at
# coalition forces at a time when they knew there were a
# significant number of civilians present.
