Hm... I'm totally going out on a limb here, but I'll hazard a guess and 
say that perhaps those Enchanters didn't feel like casting Clarity at the 
time, and didn't particularly need the money... Were you polite when 
asking for it? The fact that you were offering money does not immediately 
translate into those Enchanters somehow being suddenly obliged to take 
you up on it.

I will do no end of drive-by SoWings when I have the spell memorized, but 
normally I don't (it lasts long enough that I normally have something 
else in that slot), and while sometimes I'll sit on my butt and memorize 
it if I see someone asking for it, sometimes I just can't be bothered... 
Unless it's CR, they don't *need* SoW any more than I *need* Clarity, 
nice as it is to have. Whether they are offering money or not never 
enters the equation.

I may be a soloing Druid, but I subscribe to the opinion that, if I 
wanted to have Clarity on all the time, I should play my Enchanter. 
Offering money for it does increase my chances of getting Clarity, but it 
doesn't entitle me to it.
