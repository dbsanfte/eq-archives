/agree. It's the goal of every business to milk as much money out of 
their customers as possible. It's the successful ones that manage to do 
it without making their customers feel like they're getting milked. SoE 
lost their ability and/or desire to do this years ago.

I disagree. I have no interest in any sort of zone wars, as I can't 
imagine them being effective unless there were a PvP element to them, 
and PvP doesn't appeal to me in the least. However, I do very much like 
the idea of the landscape changing, even if just old world content. 
True, they often over-simplified it, but it does keep the environment 
from getting stale. If people choose to restrict themselves to PoK, the 
moon and beyond, that's their choice, but there are still plenty of us 
in it for the atmosphere as well.

Oh, and I'm with you on the journal. I never read it either. I'm paying 
them money every month to show it to me, not make me read about it. :P
