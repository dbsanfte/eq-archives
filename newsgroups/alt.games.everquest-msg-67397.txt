That happens when you are really good friends for 17 years before you get 
married so there's none of the bullshit that a lot of people that are young 
when they get married have in their relationships.

She enjoys stuff I don't enjoy, I enjoy stuff she doesn't enjoy, and we 
both enjoy doing stuff together.  I don't get upset when she watches TV and 
cross-stitches, and she doesn't get upset when I play EQ.

We have what we consider to be the perfect marriage.  It's kind of 
sickening, in a way, how happy we are.
