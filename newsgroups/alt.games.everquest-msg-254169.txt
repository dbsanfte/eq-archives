Yes, but it was commenting on how fear kiting via intimidate doesn't 
work so well in general.  While rogues have some troubles with the skill 
which they share with berserkers, my point is that this particular one 
(relying on an unreliable snare as well as an unreliable fear) doesn't 
seem to be one of them.

Just because thread drifted and then you drifted it even further, 
doesn't mean its impossible to drift it back into the original direction!
