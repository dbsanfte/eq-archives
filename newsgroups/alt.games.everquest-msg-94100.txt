You do realize that sarcasm often relies heavily on tone of voice to
be identified, right? And that tone of voice cannot easily be conveyed
in a written form? And that with no indicators that the comment was
meant in jest, one can't really tell it wasn't meant to be taken
seriously?

Nah, of course not, we're all supposed to be fucking cyberspace
mind-readers.
