Oh get a clue willya?  That 1100hp heal is _not_ fast casting.  Any
heal you can't reliably cast while you're being beat on does not
qualify as fast, and a 5.0 second cast time does not meet that
standard.  And the mana efficiency on that heal sucks donkey balls.
Add that to the lack of Specialization skill, the reality that it's
a damned rare Paladin who has a good set of type IV focus items, and
the fact that Paladins are standing in melee, not medding, and the
value of that spell isn't 1/10th what you'd like to claim.  Next
you'll start spouting ridiculous bullshit like the Warrior who tried
to claim that Paladin healing was close to Shaman healing.  And our
group heals, while nice for the fast casting time, have such a long
recast that they're value is also limited.  As for Paladin HoTs, did
you know that they have recast times longer than the fucking duration?
You can't heal a group with that, hell you can't even heal yourself
with that much of the time because some Cleric is gonna overwrite it
with his HoT which he can keep going on five players at once.

Paladins have the best healing of any non-priest class.  It's damned
cool to be able to heal that well with a tank.  But it's flat-out
absurd to compare Paladin healing to any of the Priests.  We fill a
niche at need, they handle a role at will.

I am begining to believe that every Warrior in EQ is green to the gills
with class envy.  Yes, Warriors need a boost to make them desirable to
XP groups.  No, your out-of-context numerical comparisons don't mean
diddly squat, they're no more valid now than when you were insisting
that LH and HT were justification for Paladins and SKs being totally
fucked during Kunark.
