Right.

It's an augment that only fits onto a charm. It will fit any charm as
far as I know, and you can always replace it free of charge if you
upgrade your charm slot. As someone mentioned, the easiest charm to
get if you're high enough lvl is the one in PoP. You just hail an NPC.

A minimum of 50 since you can't assume that they'll be distributed
evenly. If you had 19 wins in each theme, that would only count as 5
upgrades.

I'm not even sure if the aug can go up to +10 but yeah, it would be a
bitch to max out your LDoN augment. It's been a while since I saw any
numbers but I think it was somewhere around 80 wins in each theme to
max it. 

On the bright side, LDoN is one of the best places to work on resist
gear due to the augments (for your regular gear) that drop there.
