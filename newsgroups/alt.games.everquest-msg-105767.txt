Where do you get that from?

There are only a handful of items that cannot be twinked, out of the
many thousands of items available. Verant has had 3+ years to
eliminate multi-questing of no-drop items (which are commonly twinked
through MQ'ing), and they have not stopped it yet.

The change to the Venom Axe was needed. It is not the end of the
world, or the beginning of the elimination of twinking.

Verant has done a LOT more to encourage twinking than to discourage
it.
