I fully agree. Tweety is one of the worst things to happen to MMORPGs
anywhere. From a ranter dedicated to tearing down whatever she
disliked to a corporate shill still living off that reputation.

Hiring Tweety was all that was necessary to see what Mythic's idea of

and put them in your pocket. Of course, that wasn't the ONLY example
of Mythic's disgusting business practices....
