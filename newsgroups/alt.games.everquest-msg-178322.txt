	Realize they are doing you a favor.

	How much do you think a 60+ chanter can make per hour hunting mobs? 
	Quite a bit.  If the common donation dropped to 10p or less I think
	you'd quickly find no chanters bothering.

	Personally I look at it this way; how much more will I make because
	I've got KEI then had I not?  If I'm hunting HGs with my lvl 47
	mage, we're talking about 1k or more over the life of extended KEI
	that I wouldn't have without it.  If I'm twinking a friend or an alt
	account, I'll gladly drop a healthy donation to cut down my early
	lvling time in half or more.

	Forced down time requirements is something I've never liked and EQ
	is horrid about this.  It's simply not fun.  It isn't a "feature",
	it's a bug.  If it costs me 10p/hour to fix such a huge bug so be
	it.
