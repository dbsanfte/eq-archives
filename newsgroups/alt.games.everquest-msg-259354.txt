Thanks, looks like this is the successor to the old DSLReports. I've already 
starting reading reviews of my local cable provider. To give you some idea 
of the local competition, check this out. Some guy reviewed his cable 
service with Millienium Digital and gave it a very good review. A reply from 
someone identifying themself as a Senior manager for the competition:

***************

Here is the thing...it is good that you are "happy" with your own little 
fantasy world with the cable modem.

But why, for heavens sake, don't you just stop being in front of your 
computer for all hours of the day, running "speed tests" to determine if 
this is for you or not. If cablespeed was not the answer, then what? Dial 
Up? If the DSL package was not suitable to your highnesses needs in the 
area, then what were you going to do if you did not like cable speed. Stop 
looking for something to whine about and go spend time with your family 
before you look up and they are gone...

A thing about that, there are no such things as saturated lines in cable. 
Each individual cable for internet service is run to YOUR home...not shared. 
This prevents the saturation because of "overcrowding" similar to what 
happens with DSL and regular DIAL UP service.

Next, the only wide-open security holes in cable service are all related to 
the user. If you provide your computer with an adequate firewall, then you 
will be able to surf and leave the modem connected at all times.

Think before you type, and just in case you want to try to "snap back"...I 
am the Senior Internet Manager for Comcast Cablevision, a competitor to 
Millenium Digital Media in several areas.

*************

Who says cable companies have a customer service problem? Omg, what am I 
getting myself into lol ...
