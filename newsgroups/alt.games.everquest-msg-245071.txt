I've been buying vegetables on my server. There are rarely more than a
handful for sale in the bazaar at any time and they're pushing towards
20 plat each.

I've also been taking time off from my main to PL a forager, in my

I've used MoR for PLing for about 3 years. The damage from it has
never been attributed to the cleric.
