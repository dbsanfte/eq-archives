Gotta say, I really like the way all my girls look now. I was wondering why
a halfling male came up to me last week and said he thought the new look was
sexy. Since I turned on textures, I can see what he means. Yeah, I know,
it's just a game. But they do look sexier. They even -run- sexier LOL... and
don't get me started on how they look when they sit! I think the dev team
did a great job on appearances (or whoever it was who did it!)
