Ok, I have been away from EQ for a long time, at least 8 months, maybe longer.
Time has been a big issue, but I think I will be able to play again.
I have a few questions.
Will my old characters be available?
I have (or had) a Lvl 51 druid. Will I be able to recover him?
How has the new expansion changed things?
Is it worth it to buy?
Thanks, any info appreciated.
Rodjk
