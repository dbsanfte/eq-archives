Start fletching.  The kit is about 1.5 plat and supplies are cheap.  Buy
stacks of arrow heads, shafts, large nocks, and round cut fletchings for 1.2
gp each.  Combine 1 of each in the kit and you should end up with about 40
arrows (8 out of 20 successes at first).  The arrows are better than what
you can buy from a vendor.  Soon you will be fletching 150 range arrows
(approx 95 for about 2pp when your skill gets up there, I always get 1
failure per 20 attempts).  You can sell extra arrows (range 150) for about
1pp per stack and make a decent profit.
