Man, you all need to stop leveling through LOIO, OT, then DL/KC... that's
why you guys are so poor.  By 50 i had at least 5k in my bank (thanks to
Lguk especially), and by 55 i had well over 50k (thanks to Seb and Chardok).

At 60 with 2AA points, i have over 120k now (think of this as just two good
drops in Seb... fungi and Heiro cloak.  If you spent a month here, i
guarantee you'll get at least 100k worth of items).
