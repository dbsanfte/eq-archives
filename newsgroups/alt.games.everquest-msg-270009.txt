Don't give it up completely yet.  A lot of folks are forming
relationships with others as cross-suppliers for just this reason.
People will figure out soon enough that trying to market your interim
pieces as if this were the EQ1 bazaar isn't going to work.

Make some noise in the crafting channel and see if there are people out
there willing to do some trading.  If I recall correctly, you should
have some items that others will need for their finished products.  It
is, after all, a *trade* craft. ;-)
