Pretty sure he does drop normal diamonds...but blue diamonds? Dunno about
that. If he was a good source, you'd think he'd be farmed a lot...but I
haven't really seen anyone doing him (other than to to say that they did)
since kunark came out. Guard camp is one of the best sources of blue
diamonds in the game.
