go at daytime, and kithicor isnt a problem. Just stick to the zone wals and
you shouldnt have any trouble. get sow and youre totally set. Without invis,
getting through highpass can be a problem for low levels. Do it during peak
time, and there wont be any gnolls or orcs to bother you most likely. Apart
from that, if you can get sow you should be fine for the rest of the trip.
I usually go therough highpass cos its less zones.
You can also go through SK,RM,feeroot,innothule,sro,oasis,nro. Most of that
is easy enough, but you might be kos to the bouncers in feeroot if youre not
an evil race. Also you have to swim through a lot of lake rathe.
Final method, catch the spires at NK to GF, and catch the boat to fp.
