Check Tiger Direct for prices on PC 133 RAM, It will be a little more than
others but they have a good rep for replacing things that don't work. go
with 2 256 meg sticks.

For the cheaper way to go see about getting an ATI Readon 32meg. They work
well with EQ and cost less than Nvidia.

That means you MUST use RDRAM and MUST use it in matched pairs...IE 2 128
meg pc 800 Rimms

or is there an alternative here that will work? What stats


Check Comp-U-Plus for prices on RDRAM, give them a call and ask them if any
RIMMS will work in your machine (It should since RDRAM is made by only 1
company)

DO NOT DO THIS! Your first system uses SDRAM and the second uses RDRAM! they
are NOT compatiable at all and will cause system damage if you do it.
