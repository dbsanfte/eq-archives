No! Don't waste them on spell skills. They will go up fast and max for each
level in normal play. Just put 1 point in new skills as you get them. Save
the points for areas you may really need them later. Like taking up a trade
skill or finally getting that one weapon in a skill you have been lacking.
Channelling and all the abjuration and such will go up fast during fighting.
If not spend a little time in town casting on yourself or your pet to raise
the skills. Just be careful of AoE spells around NPCs.
