All the cleric Symbol spells require a gem.
The very first one eats a Cats Eye Agate each
cast (about 2.5gp).  From about level 44 on
their symbols eat a Peridot (11pp each).  As
you can imagine this adds up for the cleric.

Basic rule of thumb, if you're going to be asking
for symbol, have the appropriate gem with you and
give it to the cleric.

This also applies to enchanter Runes and Mages
Call of the Hero  (only pearls, about 4pp each,
Runes take the same gem as a similar level symbol).

There are other spells that require reagents, but
most you won't have to worry about (mage pets, 
necro pets, Necro rezzes)

Short list of Symbols:

Level 14 Symbol of Transal - Cats Eye Agate (2.5 GP approx)
Level 24 Symbol of Ryltan  - Bloodstone (5gp)
Level 34 Symbol of Pinzarn - Jasper (8gp)
Level 44 Symbol of Naltron - Peridot (11pp)
Level 54 Symbol of Marzin  - Peridot (11pp)

Also remember that the early ones last a half hour
or less.
