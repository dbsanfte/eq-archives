Getting 64 doesn't look too impressive so far, I only had two spells in 
my bags, Maelstrom of Thunder and Shield of Maelin.

The Maelstrom looks like a slight upgrade to a line I very rarely use, 
the rains.  This one does 900 damage a pop, not much better than the 
last one at 800 a pop.

Shield of Maelin impressed me even less, a whopping 50 more hp, 10 more 
MR and 2 more AC than Shield of the Arcane.

I Don't Have:

Destroy Summoned: Given the rarity of Summoned Mobs, do I care?
Girdle of the Magikot: Will be a nice boost for pets, but I do have the 
  belt
Imbue Air: what is this line used for?  Never had anyone ask for it
Planar Renewal: Only one that really seems interesting, a radically more 
efficient and somewhat larger pet heal.
Protection of Callilav: LDoN only, and looks pretty useless most of the 
time, I don't have the previous one either.

Further, spells I don't have from previous levels

Blade of the Kedge: I already have the other two high end pet weapons
Child of Ro: Fire Pet?  Am I supposed to take this seriously?  My 
favorite line of pets pre 50, but then they started casting spells, and 
doing so like total idiots.
Malosinia: Not unresistable like Mala, a slight upgrade to Malosini.  Yawn?

Burning Sand: Faster cast might be interesting, seems to be same mana 
ratio as other high end mage spells.  I'm not sure I could stand the 
shame of doing only three digit damage though, heck, I've seen people 
with procs bigger than this!
Imbue Earth
A couple of the summons, but all those are in the 63 Jewelry Bag

probably a few from lower levels too, obviously the Ancient Ones, and 
maybe one or two others

What I'll be going for:  Cash to buy Planar Renewal (seen as low as 
1kpp); given my general lack of interest in the 63/64 spells it doesn't 
seem like a good idea to buy Spectrals, each of which will probably NOT 
be a spell I'm eager for.

Getting off the level treadmill for a little while and getting 3 AA for 
the second level of suspend pet; being able to stow an unbuffed ungeared 
pet isn't very impressive, but going to full throttle seems a lot handier.

After that I plan to get 65, although mostly for the convincing "oh he's 
65 he must be ok" angle rather than for the spells, since I doubt I'll 
be seeing a lot of Rune drops and can't really see affording the spells 
which seem to be going at 50kpp a pop more or less.  Perhaps thats the 
angle I should pursue, though, look into ways to make "real money" as a 
mage.  Summoning pet gear at around 25pp a kit isn't going to buy those 
spells!

Splendid One, 64 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
