	No, there was not.  Jason Carter wanted out to spend more time with his
family, and Marcus was doomed to die in any case.

	There was supposed to be a romance subplot between Ivanova and (ptui!)
Byron in season 5.  And if I were an actress whose character was slated for a
romance with Byron, I'd have jumped ship too.
