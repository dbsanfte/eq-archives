It all depends on what the bandwidth costs and how much these
site actually use. I have never seen any hard numbers. All they
say is "it costs a truckload" yeah so? How much is that? How
much are they paying vs. how much are they taking in.

That would be an absolutely incredibly mind boggling stupid thing for Verant
to do. Yeah lets sue the fan sites that 99% of all the players use and love.
What a horrible PR disaster that would be. I can see all the news sites
drooling to put that in 72 point bold font right on their front pages.
