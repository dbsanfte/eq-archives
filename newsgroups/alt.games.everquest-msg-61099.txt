Yeee...eees.... but, I mean, with EQ you're talking about generally
having lots and lots of players (I was at a Tormax raid yesterday
with about 100 people including the spectators that turned up) and
potentially lots of critters AND potentially, in out door zones, trees
and whatnot all over the place.

FPS games tend to go to about 32 people max and have very carefully
crafted levels that use corridors and architecture to limit the horizon,
as I understand it.

Its not quite the same proposition. I personally *like* the idea that EQ
will still look good in 6 months. In fact, Im hoping that *this* time round
they did all the textures and models at the level required for 6 years
and are releasing scaled *down* versions now so that in future they can
just rebuild everything at the next notch up and re-release, rather than
reinvesting all that art time....
