The trick there is, who's morality do you use?  Mine?  Yours?  Jerry

Laws are not necessarily legislated morality.  BAD laws tend to be, I
think.  Laws are rules to make a society work.  Just allowing people
to kill whomever is, generally speaking, bad for a society as a whole.
Same for stealing.

I don't think Saddam's even goes so far to think 'the hell with
everybody else', most of the time.  He a thug with pretensions.  The
end result is that people get hurt, which is bad.  But is it evil?
Tough call.  I'd say no, but I don't have a summer home in Saddam's
head either.  He might be willfully and knowingly causing pain and
suffering.  Then that would be evil.

Broadly speaking, yeah.

Just because they weren't evil doesn't make the responsible for a
whole lot of suffering.  Not being evil doesn't make you good.

Yeah, and they are fucked in the head.  They are bad.  Are the evil?
Once again, in my definition, probably not.
