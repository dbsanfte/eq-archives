Aye, I have.   Many times as a cleric, but wasn't trying to land 
anything on him.  Just the once as a mage; I was told to get into melee 
range.  Did so, spells landed.

Never tried landing spells on him from outside melee range.  After all, 
I was told I had to be in range, and sure enough, landing spells from 
there did work, and I know that -some- dragons (and other boss mobs) do 
work this way.

Add to that the Kobe008 (who I was responding to) saying he wasn't able 
to land any spells at all as a level 55 shaman... well, sure looked like 
confirmation of what I'd been told.

What do you think the explaination is for this curious report, then? 
Level?  Sean reported similar problems as a 56 beastlord.  I thought 
that A) the hard cap on top level mob you can effect was removed quite 
some time ago, B) Xanamech isn't all that high level anyway.

Next time (I'm sure there will be a next time, Xanamech is a pickup raid 
target of some frequency, and as an unguilded I'm happy to go on pickup 
raids because I have no duty to think of, and the loot is always 
randomed... not that Xana has anything I really need, but there's the 
principle of the thing) I'll try it from a distance.  But is it really 
possible to land spells from outside AE range?  I thought his range was 
very long indeed.

Splendid
