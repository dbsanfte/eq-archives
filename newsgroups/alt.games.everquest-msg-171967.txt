    At some point, top guilds have to stop using this. When a guild on my
server that had wiped to Emperor for months finally killed him a week or two
after PoP release, we knew it was because of PoP advances and not because
they suddenly got an infusion of skill. But recently a guild that had never
even tried Emperor pre-PoP killed him with 48 people for their first kill.
Immediately people in /gu started peeing all over them, saying they only did
it with PoP slows and advances and blah blah blah. They killed him with at
least a dozen less people than we ever used, and it still isn't something to
be proud of? It's not an attitude I'm comfortable with because the
implication is that after one guild has done it, it becomes trivial. And I
think guilds that work hard with what they have to get new kills deserve to
revel in their accomplishments, and not have them belittled.

    There's a nice description of Rampage on Steel Warrior right now, but be
sure to read the entire thread very carefully - there's a few key error
corrections in it.

    In a lot of cases, it's because of competition. The longer you're
sitting in VT, the more time CiH has to go kill other things. Most spoilers
come out after some top guild somewhere doesn't need to go someplace anymore
and doesn't care if the competition can do it quickly.
