Psst - run somewhere else, then.  I didn't like the Ak'Anon area
*before* they changed it.  Tiny newb area, very close to large mean
dogs that will break all your bones before killing you, hills so steep
that when you run after something you slide right past it down to the
bottom and aggro one of everything that happens to be wandering
around... ooh FUN!

Therefore, the few times I've rolled a gnome, I get it OUT of Ak'Anon.
Fairly easy process - nothing much wanders the path from Ak to LFay
until you get very close to LFay, then you just keep an eye peeled and
run like heck.  LFay, it's a what, 30 second run along the right hand
wall to GFay.  Turn right and you can bind in Felwithe and fight in
the Kel or Fel newb areas.  Turn left and you can go to BB and take
the boat to Freeport which has THE nicest hunting grounds for newbs
imho.  Well... okay, maybe FoB is better, but I don't think that'll
work too well for you :D
