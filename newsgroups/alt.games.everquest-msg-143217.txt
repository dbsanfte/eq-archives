I've got a serious problem: I don't have a guild anymore. Is there a website
where I can post information and advertise for a guild to join?

I'm on The Rathe server, and I quit playing EQ for several months due to a
bad internet connection and some computer problems. During that time, my
guild disbanded....sort of.

I was in a guild called Mountain Priest Disciples, which was part of the
Yamabushi Clan (sort of a subguild for lower level members). Yama and MPD
disbanded, with some of the members of Yama forming a new guild called
Shadows of Yamabushi, with some MPD members who posted on the guild's
message board in a `Roll Call' forum grandfathered into Shadows of
Yamabushi, even though they were low levels.

Problem is, I'm waaaay lower level than everyone in Shadows of Yamabushi and
I don't want to even bother asking if I can get in since I wouldn't be able
to go on raids or group with anyone. (The lowest level member I've seen
listed is around level 50)
