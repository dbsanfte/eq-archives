Let's take a look at simple economics. Economics is the study of the choices
people make among scarce resources with alternative uses. Supply and Demand.
Now lets look at Norrath and EverQuest over time. Money and items do not
leave the economy, however, new and better items are introduced all the
time. Also, new money and items are constantly being added to the economy.
When we graph things out, we see that with items with an  inelastic demand,
no substitutes, and inherent disposability (bone chips, bat wings, etc) the
increase in the money circulating in the economy has a greater effect on the
price than the increasing availability of those items. Their price
increases. When we look at an item which is inexpendable and has a fairly
elastic demand curve, and many close substitutes, you will find that as
supply increases (more enchanters to do the quest) the increased supply, and
increased competition from other goods has a greater effect on the price
than the increase in money circulation. The price therefore goes down over
time.

No one's lowballing you, they're just following sound economic principles.
