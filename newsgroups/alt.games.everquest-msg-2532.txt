That may depend on the level and casting skill of the shaman in question.

All right, I'm down with 1200 being substantial.  I assume you're soloing 
cazel, since you consider it impossible for any tanks or wizards you may 
happen to be grouped with to do that damage in 2 minutes.  I further 
assume you're sure there's 2 minutes left in the fight, so all that damage 
gets done.  I also assume that for some reason you'd rather not take the 
270 mana difference between sicken and plague, and use it (ok, and another 
50 mana) to cast an envenomed bolt, which does about 90% of the damage of 
plague in 42 seconds rather than 2 minutes.  

I really don't see why you're so against the idea of using sicken to stop 
regen.  If, for whatever reason, I had 10% mana left and wanted to stop 
regen, I know which one I'd use.  I'm sure there are situations in which 
either spell might be the more effective, even against the same mob.
Insisting that one of them is always better and dissing anyone who might 
see a use for the other seems rather close-minded to me.

But perhaps, when I've gotten to level 49 or so I'll magically see the 
light and close myself off to outside ideas as well.

How many HP does Cazel have, roughly, anyway?
