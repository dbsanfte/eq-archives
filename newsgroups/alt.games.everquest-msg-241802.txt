When they decide they are going away ;)

I don't think you want the fabled ancient cyclops, unless you want a
finger slot item that is not very good compared to modern things in
the bazaar. Yeah, its finger slot on the fabled AND it doesn't get you
jboots. The way quests work in the game is that if the gnome wants the
ancient cyclops ring, he wants the "ancient cyclops ring." Fabled
won't work.

I think the fabled is the one popping in SRO? Anyone seen a fabled pop
in OOT? I was camping the AC in oot a couple times, since no one is
there and luckily the translocators are always up lately ;)
