The discussion switched to be about how WoW does it whilst you weren't
looking.  In a large proportion (most?) of the quests you get a choice
of two or three items as your reward.  In WoW, you can usually choose
something that you could use (you may not actually use it for various
reasons but you could in theory)  Also, you can always sell attuned
(soulbound in WoW) items to vendors so even if you don't want it you
can get some material benefit from the quest.
