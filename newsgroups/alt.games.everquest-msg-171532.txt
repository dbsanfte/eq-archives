First, get a map from www.eqatlas.com. You will see that the easiest ways to
get to Paludal Caverns is through the Bazaar, to Shadow Haven, to Paludal or
from Shar Val, to Shadeweaver's Thicket, to Paludal.

Second, the easiest way to leart to swim is to either go to the pool in
Shadow Haven, go to a corner, point up, and autorun. Or, you can go to Halas
and swim back and forth from Halas to Everfrost.

Finally, unless you want your Druid to drown, it's really important to learn
to swim, especially if you get an Enduring Breathe item.
