    It's not the gap. The gap is getting larger than ever this expansion - 
32/21 one handers and gear with 275 HPs has already been discovered. They're 
trying to make non-raiders feel powerful compared to their environment, and 
trying to ensure that gear improvements are reaching the non-raiding 
populace.

    To make non-raiders feel more powerful, they've not only significantly 
upped the quality and quantity of droppable items, but they've also moved to 
a lower DPS, higher HPs model on mobs. Lower DPS means tanks with lower 
HP/MANA can tank and classes other than cleric have a chance of healing 
successfully. Higher HPs means more of a premium is placed on good DPS 
classes. Since most of the good droppables are attunable, they don't linger 
in The Bazaar to be snapped up by the next generation of players at bargain 
basement prices, but they can be found by players who don't read spoiler 
sites and don't know that if they tough it out in some areas that they can 
come away with exceptional gear. How many people do you know that geared off 
of sewers/Vxed/Tipt nameds, off named mobs in Ferubi and Barindu, off the 
relatively easy stuff that was already available for them? And because that 
gear was No Drop, if people didn't go get it they'd never get it and the 
raider/non-raider gap would get even larger.

    They've done a good job with the new model. Raiders get better kill 
rates by higher DPS and by pulling more mobs at once, as we can now handle 
larger pulls without wiping. Non-raiders use standard pull methods and 
handle the same content. There are areas where the non-raiders would get 
creamed, like Riftseeker's, but eventually they'll be there, too.
