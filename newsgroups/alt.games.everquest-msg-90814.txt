In another thread, someone mentioned something to the effect of players
generally dont understand the complexities and intricacies of running and
maintaining an online game like Everquest.

I don't have to understand the complexities and intricacies to know that
Everquest was more stable and more trouble-free (Not entirely trouble-free,
but more trouble-free.) before the launch of Luclin.

Many of these problems are _constant_ and some are recurring. (Crashing to
desktop while zoning, for example.)

The game is now more aggravating than it is fun. Defeating its purpose.

I bought a new video card, in good faith, thinking these ongoing, constant
problems were temporary with the launch of Luclin.

I just renewed my account for another 6 months so maybe I'll stop playing
for a few months and see what it's status is then.

Probably won't change. Many (Many, not all.), like myself, will not cancel
their accounts because of the time spent building characters. Refunds should
be issued, not to pay the players back for time they should have been able
to play (Not including reasonable downtime caused by maintence/patch.). The
money will be trivial to the player, but won't be as trivial to Verant
depending on the scale of the problem.

So, if many (Still many, not all) people will not cancel their account, what
motivation have they to improve the situation?

Last night, I went into chat while waiting for my character to log out after
a linkdeath caused by zoning (gating). People were complaining about various
things when a guide said something to the effect of people should take more
personal responsibility in the maintence of their systems [then their
problems would stop occuring]. (A guide giving technical advice is like
cashier giving advice about management.) I guess I clicked my gate button
wrong and corrputed my eqgame.exe file.

:rolls eyes.
