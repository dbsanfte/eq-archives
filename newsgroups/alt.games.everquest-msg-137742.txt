No, and I will read it - I promise.  The issue I had was with the timing,
and the fear of diverting the central point(s), thats all.  Viable by
itself, perhaps, but lets let one thought follow another in sequence.

So then why insert this diversion in the discusion at this point ?
I mean, its fine that all members in the group have equal access
to "shift" the central topic to any direction at anytime, and thats
what Usenet is all about.  Not saying its wrong, but at minimual,
I am just acknowledging this.

Yes! - very much so!  When I am fighting a production UNIX computer
problem, I am sexless, and sex, sexual thoughts, and sexual preferences
are FAR removed from my mind.  At work, I HAVE no sex, no sexual
preference, sexual desire... Again, at WORK, I have no sex, no sexual
preference, no nothing like that!

So you see the novelity with that, but could the same be said of you

No, I'm saying to model it off of the logic that was built into us.

But you clearly want such variation to be free of cost (of any kind)

Thoes are only some of the costs.  The one being addressed here is the
one that you are attempting to get waved to either forward your cause,
or to get noticed, or both.  I personally think its only the later.

As little as 15-20 years ago the term "PC" was meaningless.

"I" huh?  self-serving, and selfish, but I suspose I also associated
long-term shifts in the curve with "means", average, consensus's etc.

I'm not saying that they "should" be ridiculed, but more to the point 
that mother nature, and societial behaviours at large have higher
presidence, and will be yielded to.

Point being, that it is unreasonable to take on all of society 
just to be a rebel. Not only is it impracticle, it undermines 
the actual understanding of human nature, society, and is 
self-serving, and purposely ignores all other aspects of society,
and hence the "selfishness" part of the argument.

The whole damn thread suggests otherwise! - whatareya blind!

So you are now "rationalizing" aborant behavious now ???  How does 
THAT work ??  If you wish to forward your argument on "PRINCIPAL"
(as opposed to selfishness), then your solutions should answer on
PRINCIPAL as well!

Why, because we don't have YOU, and your types going to bat for it ?

Man! - you are cornered huh?  little "check-mate" here huh. Interesting!
So its about sexual preference only when its YOUR sexual preference.
So its about "principal" ONLY when such principal fits YOUR case.

...I rest my case (and you gained no credible support)

Hows about tollerating ALL relationships, or removing ALL relationships?
You speak with fork-tongue, with variations/deaviations ONLY when it
applies to you. Weak, your overall lack of principals (as a whole)
leaves you with deminishing credibility, and dimming attention.

Work is not a drag-queen party. Nor it is a pick-up club, a street corner
in San Fran.
