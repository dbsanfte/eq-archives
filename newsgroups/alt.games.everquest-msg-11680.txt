I havent playe AC but EQ is not a game in any sense you probably think it
is.  Eq is like making a comitment.  Seriously it wasted one year of my.
The game has no mechanics for instance there is no skill involved it is a
simple click and watch.  Ac i hear has a better combat system, better than
just pushing a and watching.  Compare eq to a slot machine because in
essense thats what it is.  You find a monster hit a and wait and see what
happens.  If your lucky you get good stuff and you dont die if not your out
of luck.  For casters its pretty much the same exept you get to click spell
tabs.  Not too much fun exept for watching.  In ac i hear there is a cool
research system.  EQ the officials are total jerks.  They will always treat
you as an enemy.  I would say EQ has no future now either with ac2 being
planned and backed by the biggest monopoly in the software industry.  So
your best bet for the sake of longevity I would go AC.  My only beef with it
is the lack of a good rogue class.  And that my friend is the reason I dont
play AC :)  I dont play eq though anymore either.  I did play uo that has
got to be teh best online world ever (not game uo is far from a game).  Oh
yeah there is 0 freedom in eq.  Basicly the only freedom you have is
choosing your race and class from there you will be doing everything every
other player has done that hs chosen that race/class.  You will be lookin
for the same weapons hunting the same things etc etc.  Of course could rebel
but verant has chosen to make your life a living hell if you do.  For
instance dont plan on soloing ever if you really want to level and dont plan
on hutning anywhere elses tillk the +40 levels other than guk if your an
evil race.
