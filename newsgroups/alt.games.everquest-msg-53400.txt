Oddly enough the iksar shaman armor quests are about the easiest quests
in the game, in fact except for the arms they are all laughable and can
be done starting at level 9 solo if you have the money since the stuff
drops all the time and no one wants it. I gave up on the arms finally and
decided not to have a complete set since the frog is so rare and I killed
it like 4 times and no wood thing.

The sk armor is QUITE rare I guess. That sucks that even though he spawns
you had no boot drops. I doubt if he is less rare at another ruin.
