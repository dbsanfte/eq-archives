Dude, do you know what the fuck a clue is. He threw a formula at me
that I've never seen before in a conversation that included weapon
ratios. Logic told me that this might have been some convoluted way to
get a ratio, though it did look wrong, but, fuck, forgive me for not
being FUCKING PSYCHIC and knowing what in the flaming fuck the ass hat
was babbling about. Meanwhile, he's defending someone pissing and
moaning over a weapon getting nerfed that MINIMAL research would have
told someone with half a brain and a enough experience with EQ to be
the level where you can drop 20+k on weapons that there was a chance
of it getting nerfed.

If someone didn't do a little check on the weapon they were buying to
get a rough idea what kind of effort went into acquiring it to sell,
it's their fault if they get bitten, whether by the seller or by an
incoming nerf.
