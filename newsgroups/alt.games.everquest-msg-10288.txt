Yep, I'm on tribunal also. Tribunal was one of the first newer servers
when rubicite was nerfed so only a handful of it got into the game.
Due to slow leveling I JUST missed the old guise of the deceiver also,
basically being on my way to lower guk when a friend found it was
nerfed.

The rubicte bp is just not that big a deal now with the iksar bp and
fungi tunic. Except for the BP, Fine steel plate is about as good and
can even be died about the same color. 

On sol ro I knew people with MULTIPLE sets in the bank before it was
made lore (was "pending lore" for a long time) 

The thing is, you would not really want to use this stuff in EQ now
except maybe on a very low level twink. You have to remember that when
it was first in the game there were no class armor quests, no fine
steel plate you could make, etc so especially for classes like rangers
or shamans this was some of the best stuff even at 50. Now of course
there is SO MUCH better stuff even for twinks such as rygorr,
crustacean plate, etc so the only missed thing is the rubicte BP which
was really a cheaper regen bp.
