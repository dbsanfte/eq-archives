From Monkly Business:

  In Erudin, near the zone to Toxulia, there is a teleport gem that will
  teleport you up to the balcony above. If you face just the right
  direction and remove any speed buffs (SoW, JBoots) and hit Num Lock
  (auto run), you can continuously loop through the teleport gem.

  You'll fall off the balcony, land on the ground and get a safe fall
  check, run into the teleporter, repeat.
