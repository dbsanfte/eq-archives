Just don't give up, and you are right, this is not a very newbie friendly
game.  If it had not been for my boyfriend playing for 3 years and helping
me through it, I would've had some major problems, because as I said before,
I have very little experience with games like this. I'm glad I stuck with it
and had enormous amounts of help from him and his friends, or honestly, I
would've quit.

You've at least managed to get into the game, and that's a start.  If the
tips windows come up, take the time to read them, more people should.  Play
with the different windows so you know what each is for, rearrange them on
your screen so you are more comfortable.  What works for one player, may not
work for another.  Learn your commands, I printed out the help file that
came with the game (everquest_manual.txt).  Take notes on what you've
learned so you can refer back later.  Some of it you may not ever need after
doing it once, but other things... keep the notes.  Don't let other players
knock you down for your lack of knowledge, some people have lives other than
in EQ, and can't sit for hours at a time.  It will all come together.  Spend
some time surfing the various sites, and keep asking questions because there
are some mysteries in this game (lots, actually) that you will never find
the answer to unless you ask.

I didn't think your first post was all that bad, you were obviously
frustrated, and this game has that effect on many people.  Take some time,
create some different characters, goof off with it a while so as to give
yourself a break.  It's a game, and it's supposed to be fun, so until you
figure things out, keep your chin up.

Come to Maelin Starpyre, I've been told that the people there are the nicest
and most helpful of all the servers.  I don't know this for a fact, since
it's the only server I've ever played on, but I like to think it's true.  I
wish I was better at giving instructions via email, unfortunately, I am not,
but you have received some good input thus far.  Good luck and hope to see
you out there!
