To be honest, much like my guild agreeing to the rotations on EMarr, it was
not entirely a matter of choice.  It was the only way they could see to have
a shot at it.  So they made the agreement.  They should have lived up to it,
or not agreed to it in the first place.  I certainly don't condone them
going back on their word, however, I don't see your guilds motives in
structuring the agreement as it was being all that high and mighty either.
