Hello, I was shopping in Rivervale and noticed an item called a Razor
Fungus Claw.  It has a plus 2 STR is a range slot item and I bought
bought it for less than 2 gp.

Just curious what drops this and where, what level to kill and also
since it's a range slot item it appears to stack, but does the STR
stack as well?  If I had 2 of these would it be +4 STR if I had a full
stack would it add +40 STR?

Thanx in advance for the replies?
