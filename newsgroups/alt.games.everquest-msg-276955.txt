Yeah, that's kind of how this whole thread started :) I was feeling
punchy because of so many power-levelers going on about how no one
under level awsome can understand the game. My argument was if you only
play the upper levels, you miss out on, and ultimately fail to properly
understand or enjoy the game.  So I postulated the original question to
see who, at least in the usenet community, played in which manner.  I
have to say, I've been plesantly suprised at the number of people who
don't/didn't PL.

Yeah, I did. On the other hand, since I reached 16 after Firiona Vie
was overrun by the OT guys, I did have the fun of trying to get Breeze,
since it seems the FV Breeze vendor did not survive.
Illusion DE, Alliance, and a whooole lotta corpse runs! :D
