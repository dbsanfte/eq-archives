F8 works, sorta.  I use it to cope with multiple mobs when I'm playing
my Druid.  Sometimes the new UI's "hmm, I don't think I'll notice that
particular mouse click for a while, if ever" persona gains full control
at the worst of times.  The choice then becomes:  [1] the ever popular
run away!, [2] switch to overhead view and hope the UI starts to notice
my mouse clicks and I can remember how to maneuver w/o mouse-look, or
[3] root, back-off and mash F8 a few times, rinse-repeat as necessary.
