Quoth Don Woods :

Goranga Spiked Club for the main hand (free)
Stave of Shielding for the off-hand (2 to 4k)
Steel Rod of the Knight for 2HB (no longer drops)

Approaching 40, I bought a Zekhas's Katar. Same ratio as the GSC, but 
useful for keeping H2H skilled up. To be honest, I don't find that the 
proc makes much of a difference.
