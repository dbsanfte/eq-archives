As an Iksar monk I've taken up brewing so as to make heady kiola. Naturally I
make a lot of beer and... well somebody has to drink it! :) As a result my
Alcohol Tolerance as gone up rather quickly. I remember hearing how it was
supposed to temporarily boost your strength or stamina but, as far as I've seen,
it doesn't. Is there any benefit to a high Alcohol Tolerance?
