No. Qeynos hills up near the ruins. The odds of getting her to spawn, however,
are allegedly worse than winning the lottery *and* getting hit by lighting on
your way to cash in the ticket.  I've tried. Never saw her.  I know a few
folkes in a.g.e. have posted strategy guides here on how to get Pyzjn to spawn,
but I don't know how accurate/reliable any of them are. You could do a search.
Oh, and even for all that effort, the stone is apparently a rare drop, so you
may have to get her to spawn ten times to get one.  The beastiary discussion
list on her includes a number of folks who wanted to tear out their own livers
with a dull spoon after trying for that stone for weeks at a time.
