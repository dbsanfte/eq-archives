As stated above, he has a loooong spawn time. I believe it is 7 hours
though. Depending on your server, he may be constantly camped, as it is a
nice item. However, even on Veeshan server, which is relatively busy, I was
able to find him spawned and uncamped.
If you keep him near his spawn point, nobody will help him, except the level
40 smuggler that wanders around. Make sure he isn't near when you attack
him.
Other than that he is relatively weak, and you might be able to take him at
18, if it were me, I would wait till 19 to get the new spells.
Good luck to you!
Chaos
