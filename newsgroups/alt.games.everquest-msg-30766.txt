Actually he is a pushover.
There's two kinds of uber mobs in this game:

1.  Those that will hand you your ass on a platter.
2.  Those who have guards around them that will situationally cause
your ass to be handed to you.

Tormax is type 2.
Once you clear the guards, he's not very hard.  Especially since
Giant's Bane works on the puke.  Infact, compared to Dain 425, I'd say
it's a toss up.

I would rather face Tormax than Sontalak in terms of raw difficulty.

Of course, AoW is on a type all by himself.  That's the "WTF were you
dipshits thinking?!?" type.

Quad 1100+, flurry, over 750khps, high ATK/AC *AND* immune to Giant's
Bane...yeah, right.
