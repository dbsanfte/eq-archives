Look back over the thread, genius. Where did I claim to be debating a 
side? Your use of the word "bullshit" merely set the tone for the rest of 
your post. One which was based upon incorrect assumptions on your part to 
begin with.

Then you thought correctly. I was referring to your incorrect assumption 
that my posing of a different point of view must certainly mean that it 
is my own view on the matter. I said it up front and I'll repeat it for 
you now. I was just offering additional viewpoints for discussion. 
Additionally, no, you haven't acknowledged that much until now. You have 
continued your attempts to prove me wrong where I hadn't even expressed 
an opinoin in the first place.

Nice try, but you *are* the one being unreasonable here. You continue to 
approach this as some sort of debate between you and me. I'm not debating 
anyone. I'm merely probing the issue for the purposes of intelligent 
discussion. You put on your Captain Asshole cape and hat as soon as you 
saw what you thought was an opportunity to jump in and prove someone 
wrong, adding to your own over-inflated virtual ego.

Hmm. Nice rhetoric. I guess that's supposed to hurt my feelings or 
something. Whatever. If you can't even consider the possibility that 
maybe *you* were a bit hasty in taking up arms here, then perhaps we're 
better off in each others killfile.
