I'm afraid that nothing else will matter since they will ruin the game
with some screwed up skill by use crap like that jackass UO "designer"
stuck in SWG. I hated UO for it then they let the jackass design SWG.
So in a couple weeks everyone is a master of 9 things and all capped
out.

I'd like something more in the middle, like Anarchy Online, where you
still have to level then you get X amount of points to spread around.
That DOES make a lot of different character types while it doesn't
cause people to stand around and do repetitive things in town, while
trying on different outfits and seeing how curtains look in their
house. Star Wars virtual Barbie mansion.

I'll either like it or totally hate it depending on what convoluted
design they come up with. Big world with lots of things to do, like
EQ1 but without the timesinks, would get me.
