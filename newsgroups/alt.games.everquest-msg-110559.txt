On my raids we do /random (10x your level) to (random number near 1000
that I pick at the start of the raid.) This gives the higher level
members a *sligh* advantage on getting the gear (since they generally
contribute more to the raid overall) while still allowing everyone a
chance.

And no, our guild isn't one of those where I or the GL just issues the
drops to "whoever is next on the most deserving/needing list".
