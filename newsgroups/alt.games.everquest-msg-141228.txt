It is when the vendor sells them unlimited, which many vendors do with 
batwings.  Snake skins, I've never found a vendor that sells em 
unlimited, although I found the newb vendors around the Freeports and in 
Qeynos quite often had them.  I tried /oocing to buy snake skins but 
nobody took me up on the proposition *shrug*  But then, Freeport IS 
twink central. :)
