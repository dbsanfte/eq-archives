Well, they might respond like this;
http://www.support-group.org/OCHA%20Damage%20Report%20(gh-d)%2021%20Mar%2002.htm

"174 Palestinians have been killed in the course
of the IDF reoccupation of Palestinian areas �A�
from 27 February through 16 March 2002"

"An estimated 30 percent of fatalities have been
civilians, including children (aged 6-14)"

"Palestinian health authorities and PRCS reported
over 750 wounded with some 453 live-ammunition
injuries"

"Three health workers - UNRWA (1) and PRCS (2) -
have been killed while attempting to provide first
aid to the injured"

"13 paramedics including 10 PRCS and 3 UNRWA have
been injured (moderate to severe injuries)"

This, of course is only the casualties concerned
in the IDF reoccupation, and only for the first 16
days of March.
