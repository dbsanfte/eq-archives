I agree with that.  I wouldn't have traded the chills and thrills of
leveling my first character for anything.  You can raise your spell-casting
skills by casting in a non-combat situation, but that's going to be boring
and I don't picture someone who has been PL'ed that quickly having the
patient to just stand there and cast again and again and again.

If the person insists on PLing, the Druid can give the wizzy HP, regen, and
DS buffs and go to town in Paludral Caverns on the Hollowshade Moor side.
The Wizzie can pull with a low level/low mana damage spell and the Shaman
can focus on healing as the mob hits the wizzie.  Getting +HP gear,
particularly the +75hp/-10MR rings that sell pretty cheap in the bazaar,
helps.

Maybe a semi-PL is an option.  The Druid can SoW the wizzie and let him pull
monsters to the Druid and Shammy.  The wizard can do his work and, when the
mob is under 50%, the Druid and Shammy can finish it off.  It's not the same
learning experience as soloing or grouping with other characters of the same
level, but it's better than just getting DS'ed and having the monster kill
itself.
