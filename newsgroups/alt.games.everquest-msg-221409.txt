And deaths happen to low&mid-level players on a regular basis too if 
they're doing anything beyond the bland XP grinding in OT, GD, etc... 
that is so common.

Just today my 20th level Enc, grouped with a War (19), Mag (20), and Dru 
(17) ate a double death (death during a CR [invis dropped near a 
tentacle terror]), and lost well over a yellow... a couple hours worth 
of xp... with no rez. We didn't have a cleric/pali in our group, and the 
zone (Najena) was deserted aside from us. It wasn't the highlight of the 
evening.

My high level characters never have to eat that much loss... EVER.

I didn't say the wait for corpses should be 3 hours. I'd be happy for 
players to go to the graveyard, click on 'a tombstone' and pop they're 
unrezzable corpse out.

If the a raid member dies, and he can be rezzed then its the same deal 
we have today. Or if the raid *can* get back to the corpses then its the 
same deal we have today.

But...If the raid wipes, and can't get back then they eat a death, and 
grab their corpses at the graveyard.

Again... this is a reality in the mid-level game too, provided you hunt 
in interesting places, and challenge yourself.

It seems odd to me that the penalty for dying at 30th level be 
substantially greater than that of dying at 65th.

You've got valid points, and I'm not exactly keen on the idea of a 
*deep* planes raid wipeout costing everybody a ton of xp... as a matter 
of course... perhaps a whole new line of high level rezzes that are only 
partial rez, but can pull the corpse out of another zone...to the player 
instead of the player to the corpse.. and give them to necros and 
clerics... i dunno ... just thinking out loud...
