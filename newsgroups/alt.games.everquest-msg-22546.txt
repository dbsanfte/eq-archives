My advice is:  Don't worry about dying.  Worry first about training your raid
and getting it wiped out.

Anyone who is worried about dying should not be in the planes.  If you get hit
when you zone in, do not run to the camp trailing mobs.  Take your location --
maybe move a little to the high south wall -- and die like a man.
