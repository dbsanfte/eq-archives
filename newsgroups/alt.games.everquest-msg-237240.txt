Not everyone believes in a God that hands out infinite punishment.

Perhaps non-Earthly punishment isn't necessary *at all*.

The souls that were the victims of such atrocities may not desire

Does it *need* to be best?  If we're talking an eternal time frame,
his plan just needs to work *eventually*.  :)

he gave us free will, which makes us ultimately unpredictable.
