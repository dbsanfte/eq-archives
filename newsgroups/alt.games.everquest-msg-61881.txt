I ran in 64M of ram for a while (a long time ago) and had heaps of problems
with swapping at inconvenient times (falling through the lift at kelethin
for example). You should have at least 128M, and perhaps you might need a
faster machine anyway (anything with only 64 M is probably pretty old). I
run a 733 Mhz box with 256 Mb of ram, and I dont get any crashing or
freezing.
