I have a quick question about the Earring of Solstice for those of you who
have done the quest, especially ogres/trolls.  I have all nine gifts for the
quest and combined them into the forge and got the druid only earring and
the lvl 60 (wish it was no drop) druid spell but for the earring to be
useful to me, an ogre shaman, I need to hand it in to a rebecca in fungus
grove.  This is the part I'm a bit unsure on.  All through my shaman's life
he's been hated by everybody, so is there any faction needed for the handin?
Hopefully I can just hand it in for the FT1 earring.  Any feedback would be
great.  Thanks in advance.
