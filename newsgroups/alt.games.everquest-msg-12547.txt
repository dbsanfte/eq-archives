Are you using nukes/spells to fight with your 16 druid?  If so, then
that's what's taking so long.  I'm not a big fan of PL'ing, but I
created a new chanter, and found it near impossible to get to 16 from
12 (where I was stuck).  So a friend of mine logged on her 54 druid,
and in an hour I went from 12 to 14, then something came up and she
had to go.  SLN, Chloro, DS, Str, and it's all melee.  All I really
had to do was let the mob whack at me (since my melee skills aren't up
to par), and get at least 1 point of damage while the DS did the rest.
Straight up exp!!!  I have a 51 druid, and have helped friends level
on occasion, and if you do it right, it's easy.  I was fighting red
mobs in LIO with my chanter, and with no pet.  I found that the pet
was sucking up alot of my exp, so I nixed it.
