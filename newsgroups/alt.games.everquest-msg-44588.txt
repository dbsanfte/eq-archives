    But even there, there's a ton of variations. Each race/sex has a unique
piercing, 1HB, 2HB, 1HS, 2HS animation, and unique animations for the
special attacks like kick, bash etc. For casters, spell animations are coded
in by spell - some of the higher level spells use some pretty hilarious
/emotes (like /yawn for Forlorn Deeds, or /clap for Tishan's Discord).
There's a lot more variation out there than you give credit for.
