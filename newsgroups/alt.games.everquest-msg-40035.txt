So now we can clearly see the diabolical plan.  VI prevents us from
knowing the number of players per server so that we a) don't complain
that the number is too high AND b) don't complain that the number is too
low.  So in effect our ability to bitch is being nerfed.  They won't get
away with this forever though.  Funcom has clearly shown that other
companies can provide gamers with ample reason to bitch and I'd bet the
farm that DAoC provides another option for gamers to find something to
bitch about.  VI's days are numbered if they don't remember what gaming
is all about and give us something else to bitch about in return for
this nerf.
