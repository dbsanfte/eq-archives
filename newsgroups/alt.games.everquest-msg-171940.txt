Kill Hadden in Qeynos Hills and hope for a Fishbone Earring.  Good luck.  
Long spawn, not his common drop, and camp-hoars there.

Or, get some friends and go to the Grey ( will need Enduring Breath spell 
to breathe ) and kill the Shissars.  A good camp is on the West side of the 
Ssra temple.  After you get 3 No-drop organs, head to Katta and turn them 
in for an Amulet of the Grey.  It's a great item, but you need some help to 
get it, probably.  I duo'd there at level 49 ( Enchanter ) with a level 60 
Ranger.

Look up both items on www.allakhazams.com.  There are probably more EB 
items for a Wiz, but I'm not familiar with them.
