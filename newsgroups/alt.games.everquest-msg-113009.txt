> So, any suggestions on where to go now?

As has already been said, Highkeep is a good choice.  Experienced adds up
very fast there.  It is only about one step above LOIO though as many
inexperienced players gather there.  However, it is a very convenient zone
to fight in because you can bind in the bank right above where you will be
fighting.  It is almost always busy there, which means it is easy to find
groups, the problem is more likely that the groups will be full.

Another option (also not on the moon) is South Karana.  There are a number
of good camping spots there and again a lot of people there to group with.
Experience is almost as good as High Keep, but loot is a little better.  It
is not as convenient as the nearest bind point is North Karana gypsy camp
and there is no bank nearby.
