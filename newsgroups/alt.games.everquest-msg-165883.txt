Oh i agree.. but I think making malo turn mobs into summon-mode is a better
immediate solution.  E.g how else could they stop the HP encounter being
ruined? (ie fighting it alone in the Jails) or bypassing content (the
oldschool uber guild vulak sploit) without making drastic zone changes?

Perma rooted definately reduces the difficulty of pretty much all encounters
imo

Errr... why pre-clear in anticipation of the mob, when her popping would
cause a planes re-pop? =d
