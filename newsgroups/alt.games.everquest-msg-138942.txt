I kept a pretty close eye on the player auctions site (
http://www.playerauctions.com )as the items prices by dollar value when
converted back to plat pretty much set the premium price for in game palt
value for items on the server I was on - and you could even compare prices
between servers. By keeping an eye on what sold and for what prices you
could also get an idea on what was in demand and what wasn't.

That experience proved pretty much invaluable during the first week of
Bazaar trading and I managed to make a small plat fortune, but things have
stabilised now and a flat market is harder to make profits on (I am talking
plat here, not $ of course).

Overall since bazaar was fully implemented, value for all but the "uberest"
(eww, I hate that word) items have crashed significantly and a welcome side
effect is that the real cash for game items peeps are going to be in for a
rude shock as their market evaporated overnight. For less hassle and much
cheaper comparative prices (if you convert plat to cash at the going rate)
you can securely use the bazaar.

So everyone - let's have a minutes silence for all those poor item for cash
traders who have been so brutally reamed:

BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
