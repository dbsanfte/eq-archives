As I've said elsewhere, I respect that some people don't want 
interference.  But in fairness to the devs, I feel that there is such an 
enormous multitude of opportunity for xp that unless someone makes it 
their life project they cannot stop your advancement or even delay 
reaching 50 with more than a few hours.  Unless you have sworn to never do 
door missions, for instance, you are likely to shake off anything less 
than a jealous ex.

The big deal with killstealing is not the loss of xp but the implied 
insult.  And some people, regardless of archetype, react much stronger to 
that than others.  Personally I never ascribe to malice that which can be 
explained by stupidity. This largely comes from seeing copious amounts of 
stupidity wherever humans are gathered, and sometimes in retrospect even 
in my own life.
