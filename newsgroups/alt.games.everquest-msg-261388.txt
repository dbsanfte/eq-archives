Guilds consisting of fewer than 10 individual accounts in its
membership get deleted from time to time, at least this was true at
one time. The charter is just RP-ish stuff, and they aren't forced by
SOE to abide by it. However, if a guild's members consistently violate
the rules of the game as a group, the guild will be disbanded. I saw
this happen to a guild while I was a guide on Rallos Zek.
