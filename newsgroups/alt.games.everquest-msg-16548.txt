Oh I understand that others see the issue differently, but I see it as
something that is only beneficial to guild leaders and to some extent
members.  The rest of the community sees no benefits and loses not only
the programming resources required to make it happen, but also the
processing cycles of a server that only has so many to give.  To have
such a feature would require major overhead as currently guild commands
only relate to online players.  Such management features would have to
work from the databases rather than from current active accounts and
that is the reason that VI has stated that they don't want to create
them, so far as I recall.

I don't dispute they would be nice, I just think VI should avoid going
down that path.  Others such as yourself will disagree <g>.
