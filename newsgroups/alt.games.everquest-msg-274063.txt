They are more then well within their rights. It's their server and they
can set any rules they want and enforce them any way they want. I love
the simpletons like Tcells who think they have some kind of rights on
a privately run service like Battle.net or WoW.  Laughable.

You don't even need to explain why the word is bad.  That's a strawman
argument. That's sidetracking the argument from facts. It's Blizzard's
service. They set it up and fund it.  They have complete legal right to
setup any rules they want. They can ban anyone for anything at all,
any time, anywhere, for any reason.  Period.  They can ban people
because they don't like them.   Anyone that thinks otherwise is a
fool who doesn't understand how it works, the terms of services,
and thinks they have rights that they do not have.  All this boils
down to is whining.
