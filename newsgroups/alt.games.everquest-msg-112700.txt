Any low level characters who make an ass out of themselves by begging for
buffs, usually isn't really a newbie, most times it's a twink/alt of someone
higher level who knows where to go to scavenge high level crap.

On a side note, I was in Shadeweaver Thicket last night, thinking about
getting revenge on that bastard Jynhadar (named fire elemental in the lava
tunnel, BTW, he's immune to runspeed changes).  I get a tell "Can I have
some buffs?", so I told him "Find me", about 10 minutes later after I run
out of the tunnel with an irritable fire elemental behind me and egress, I
get a tell "Are you near the caverns?", I reply "No", followed by "BTW,
Jynhadar is immune to runspeed changes".  Then I zoned in to Shar Vahl and
kept going in the general direction of Katta Castellum.   He didn't talk to
me again.
