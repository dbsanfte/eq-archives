They are apparently "evaluating" moves between servers.  What that
means, I have no idea.

As I understand it, the long queues are occurring on a relatively small
number of servers that had a hardware upgrade go wrong.  I'm on Argent
Dawn, which is very high population, and have never had a queue of more
than a couple minutes.  For the sake of people on less healthy servers,
I hope they get the issues resolved soon.
