Considering that the targets of every other transportation spell routinely have
as many as 8-10 people stacked on them, I would doubt this.

It could be tested, though, by binding two people at exactly the same spot
(using loc to get as close as possible to the exact same spot), and having one
gate there, then the other. or, heck, tp yourself to a druid ring or wizard
spire and bind, then move away and have someone tp there, then try to gate.
