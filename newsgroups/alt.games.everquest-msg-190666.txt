This is not anything major that's causing problems but more of an annoyance.
It seems that if I touch my armor, it will look like I'm not waering certain
pieces that I am. For example, I'm playing a barbarian beastlord and had
just completed the quest for the field priest leather chest piece. I had
already complete the quest for the skull cap and made a tattered leather
mask. When I put on the chest armor, other players didn't see me wearing a
cap anymore. I also looked at myseld in the face changer and didn't see the
cap either. When I went into my inventory and took the skull cap off and put
it back on again, it looked like I was wearing the cap again. The mask has
never shown up.

As I said, this isn't causing real problems. I am still getting the AC value
for wearing these items. It's just annoying for them not to show up.

TIA for any help or suggestions.
