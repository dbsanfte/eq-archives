You obviously missed the part where Arolpin pointed out he'd already
done it. (Deletion of Surname)  If additional cites are needed, a 32
Wizard in our guild did it Tuesday. (New spelling of Surname. Old name
not in any violation, etc. just wanted it changed.) For the record,
though, in terms of the "bring a lunch" thing, she said it was better
than three hours from the first /petition to the actual change. But
being a marathon player anyhow, that wasn't an issue for her. For those
who play in shorter bits, or are not online during the coveted 3 to 11
pacific time, it will still likely be an issue.
