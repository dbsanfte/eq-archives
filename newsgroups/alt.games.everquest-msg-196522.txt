I'd put the cutoff a little higher, any mob that hits for under 300 is
easy to tank at 61, argueably just as efficient as rotting since you
get to include pet damage and the 61 pet, fully hasted with focus and
dual wielding, is capable of putting out nice damge. Something that
you loose if you rot em. About the maximum I can solo tank (with Aego
for a hitpoint buffer) is a guardian wurm, hit's for about 530, but
that's a close run thing.
