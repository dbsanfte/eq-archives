We've done this quest twice in the last few weeks. You can't SoW the
general. You can't heal him. You can't buff him at all, AFAIK. You can
clear aggro with a spell since the only way to keep him near you after
a fight is over is for someone in the group to attack him and keep
him there while you rebuff/rez/loot.
