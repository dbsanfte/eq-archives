Story line finished. GM event over...back to the Skeletons and Giant Rats.

Did anyone find out the full story/quest there?
I heard someone say that the Dark elf captive was Inny's daughter, true?

Only went in there once, went to go back in the next and it was all gone,
never got the chance to find out anything.
Apart from this, if you kill a Caster NPC before he sends his pet on you,
his pet does die, if, not you are stuck with the pet after the casters
death.
This doesn't explain why many of the undead pets in Kith remain...but what
the hell, good exp :ï¿½)
