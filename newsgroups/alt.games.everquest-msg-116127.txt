But, why does this make them assholes?  EQ *does* have a trade
economy.  It is possible, and even necessary to get items to sell to
make money so you can go BUY items that might be too difficult for you
or your guild to actually go get.  

And how do you do that?  Tradeskills?  Yeah right.  No, you have to go
get items that are in demand and sell them.

I mean, it sucks that they got there before your guildies and had the
camp spot, but thems the breaks, and their need for getting the
reavers to sell is just as legitimate as someone trying to get a JR
for their epic.  

Hell, one might go as far as to think that Verant *WANTS* people to
get reavers to sell on the market because they haven't bothered to
make it a No Drop like so many other quest items.
