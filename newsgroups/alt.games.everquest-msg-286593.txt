2005

Toyoya Prius

Last month automaker Toyota announced a recall of 160,000 of its Prius
hybrid vehicles following reports of vehicle warning lights
illuminating for no reason, and cars' gasoline engines stalling
unexpectedly. But unlike the large-scale auto recalls of years past,
the root of the Prius issue wasn't a hardware problem -- it was a
programming error in the smart car's embedded code. The Prius had a
software bug.

1985-1987

Therac-25 medical accelerator.

A radiation therapy device malfunctions and delivers lethal radiation
doses at several medical facilities. Based upon a previous design, the
Therac-25 was an "improved" therapy system that could deliver two
different kinds of radiation: either a low-power electron beam (beta
particles) or X-rays. The Therac-25's X-rays were generated by
smashing high-power electrons into a metal target positioned between
the electron gun and the patient. A second "improvement" was the
replacement of the older Therac-20's electromechanical safety
interlocks with software control, a decision made because software was
perceived to be more reliable.

What engineers didn't know was that both the 20 and the 25 were built
upon an operating system that had been kludged together by a
programmer with no formal training. Because of a subtle bug called a
"race condition," a quick-fingered typist could accidentally configure
the Therac-25 so the electron beam would fire in high-power mode but
with the metal X-ray target out of position. At least five patients
die; others are seriously injured.

November 2000

National Cancer Institute, Panama City.

In a series of accidents, therapy planning software created by
Multidata Systems International, a U.S. firm, miscalculates the proper
dosage of radiation for patients undergoing radiation therapy.

Multidata's software allows a radiation therapist to draw on a
computer screen the placement of metal shields called "blocks"
designed to protect healthy tissue from the radiation. But the
software will only allow technicians to use four shielding blocks, and
the Panamanian doctors wish to use five.

The doctors discover that they can trick the software by drawing all
five blocks as a single large block with a hole in the middle. What
the doctors don't realize is that the Multidata software gives
different answers in this configuration depending on how the hole is
drawn: draw it in one direction and the correct dose is calculated,
draw in another direction and the software recommends twice the
necessary exposure.

At least eight patients die, while another 20 receive overdoses likely
to cause significant health problems. The physicians, who were legally
required to double-check the computer's calculations by hand, are
indicted for murder.

Pretty much anything software driven can crash; to use your quoted
example of ATMs there are numerous examples of BSoD, the error when
Germany transferred from the DM to the Euro, the US Fujitsu disaster
and countless others.

"Security researchers uncovered nearly 5,200 software vulnerabilities
in 2005, almost 40 percent more than the number discovered in 2004,
according to Washingtonpost.com. From the article: 'According to
US-CERT...researchers found 812 flaws in the Windows operating system,
2,328 problems in various versions of the Unix/Linux operating systems
(Mac included). An additional 2,058 flaws affected multiple operating
systems.'"

Even new MMORPGs like WoW, Vanguard and Conan are incredibly bug
ridden nevermind ones closing in on their tenth birthday where no one
currently in charge of maintaining the code was around when much of it
was written.
