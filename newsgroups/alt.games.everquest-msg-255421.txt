So while you go explore interesting and innovative zones, they should 
bang their head against the same comparatively flavorless zones 500 
times? And at the end of it, still be inferior.

Shrug, I raid just fine, thank you. I just do not have much opportunity 
to do it, nor do I wish to rearrange my life and job and family around 
EQ to make it happen more often. I wasn't aware that meant I should stay 
in LDoN for the rest of my life.

Except that this has little to do with being unable to forge bonds with 
other players. And everything to do with the fact that at 3am on a 
weekday (when I play) the selection of raid guilds to join is 
vanishingly small... and even then I don't play every weekday at 3am and 
refuse to commit to do that. If it was simply a matter of logging in at 
3am walking into the pok and ooc "looking for an interesting raid" and 
shortly therafter taking some PoP God I'd have little to complain 
about... but that isn't realistic. Even the open raids are by and large 
finished before I get online.

Yep. I was a touch rabid too, deliberately, because the poster before me 
took the stance that soloers ought to amuse themselves tradeskilling, 
farming pp, and helping others.

I'll grant that the current endgame raids are 'interesting'... but once 
any raid becomes 'farmable' the skill level required of the -average- 
particpant is pretty minimal.

As to the question of how these people get into raid guilds. As long as 
you aren't a catastrophic fuckup, don't irritate everyone in sight, and 
you play enough to get gear+aa you will successfully apply to a decent 
guild.

You don't have to be a stellar player to get into a good raid guild. You 
need to be competent, and you need gear+aa. That is hardly a selector 
for the 'best players'. Devoted mediocrity would be a better definition.

Especially when you consider that in many cases the gear and AA were not 
eked out against overwhelming odds... they were often the result of 
playing in the high level equivalents of Paludal Caverns. (Safe, easy, 
fast groups.) and hanging out with people more you than you in groups, 
on raids etc. Its easy to get decent gear if your grouping with people 
who have to let most stuff rot. =)
