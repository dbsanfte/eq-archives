Let me spell this out for both of you - the 226 ping - as you've found out
what that far left number is by now Matt - absolutely sucksass for DSL.
Hell it sucksass for a 56k modem!  Do you guys understand now?  My initial
question in the reply was genuine even if I didn't spell out the lag bar for
you like you wanted Matthew.  RTFM comes to mind, but I guess some morons
can't be bothered...

BTW, on my cable link I *never* ping above 110ms - most times I'm at 46ms
and have seen lower.

But, I'm loving this because of the wiseass replies to my post - and the
fact that said wiseasses in this case evidently have some FUCKED up
DSL/Cable service!

hehehehahahahahohohohohohoho

happy Friday kids!!
