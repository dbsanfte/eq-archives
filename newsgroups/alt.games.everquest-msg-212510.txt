No, I am using my understanding of the meaning of omniscient and 
omnipotent.

I agree, and you are right, it is very hard to talk about this without 
bringing time into it.

I disagree with you on that.  Being omniscient means he knows, period.

God is not bound by any rules, if he is indeed omnipotent.  I am not 
talking about consequences in a time line here.  In order to be both 
omniscient and omnipotent, by the definitions I understand of the words, 
it would be absolutely impossible for us, part of his creation, to have 
free will.  I am talking about the consequences of him having both 
properties, that is what this discussion is about, at least to me.

Again, it is very difficult to communicate what I am trying to say here 
without bringing some form of tense into it.  If God is omniscient, then 
he knows everything, always has, always will, no timeline involved here.  
He just knows.  Given that, and given that he created us in the manner in 
which he chose to create us, we do not have free will.

Again, it is very difficult to put this into meaninful words.  I do think 
I grasp it's meaning, I am just having a difficult time explaining it in 
words in a language that is so much based on tense.

I also don't expect to convince you of my beliefs, and I believe I do 
understand what you are saying, but, I do not agree.  To my mind, given 
what I believe are the meanings of the words, God cannot be both 
omnipotent and omniscient, and yet still leave us with free will.  Time 
is just one more dimension in Gods creation, no different to him than any 
of the others.  In my mind that does not change the fact that 

In my mind, it does not matter whether creation is thought of as the 
totallity of the entire space time continuum, or an event in time.  
Either way, given complete knowledge of everything, and the power to 
create this space time continuum however he chooses to create it, we 
cannot have free will.  From our point of view travelling along a 
timeline, we do not really have any choices that we can freely make, 
regardless of which way you look at it.

I am just hoping that I am managing to convey my thoughts on this in some 
reasonably meaningful manner here.
