Can you post your system specs, please? I'd be interested in seeing 
them. Also, Bob, if you are reading this could you post yours as well 
and give an idea of how it runs on your system?

I hate to say this having not yet played the game, but after reading 
Bob's description, I think you may be right. I was really looking 
forward to it until I read this story and the other things he's posted 
(crafting sounds like an annoying waste of time, for instance). This 
game is starting to sound really, really boring and like it doesn't 
require much tactics at all. One of the killer things about the original 
EQ is that EVERYTHING required tactics and you learned to use them or 
you got your ass kicked.
