All they have to do is get there damn hand out of my pocket and promise to
never ever ever even try to go there again. Goverment does not get a single
dollar that they first did not steal from someone at the point of a gun.
This theft steals our investment income which hugely slows down growth in
our economy which means my share does not buy as much as it should !

Oh and ,

fix education ( vouchers opening up education to competition ,destroy the
monopoly that is stifiling our children)

grandfather out social security ( just what in the hell made a pyramid
scheme sound like a good idea and to make it mandatory in a supposedly free
country?)

Divorce themselves from the enviromental whackos ( I want a nuclear reactor
in my back yard damnit, and destroying property rights is always VERY bad
even if it is to save the little birdy)

Oh and stop trying to socialize medicine. I pay enough for health care
already . I do not want to pay 3 times as much for half the result.

Reform our damn civil court system. The easiest way to do this is to make
punitive dammages go to the goverment not the plantif. We are destroying
perfectly good buisnesses every day because they are unable to handle the
costs of litigation and insurance against litigation.
