Did you start baking with fish rolls or did you put 21 practice points into
it, do some other baking then do the rolls?  I'm rather surprised you got
160-200 successes in 800 attempts.  My guess at 400 may have been a little
low, but it wasn't any more than 500...but my INT was around 200 when I did
it.
