Several problems with this; isn't the LFG tool only available to LOY players?
At any rate, its so rarely used that anyone interested in using it has learned
its useless.  Its a great tool, but not if nobody lists themselves and nobody
lists their groups, then its about as useful as a remote that doesn't go with
your TV.

I did look at the tool, and saw 4 people within 5 levels of me LFG, no groups
LFP at all.

Or too smart.  Yes, its a self fulfilling prophesy, but if nobody uses the
thing, then its no use you using it either.  Betamax was arguably the better
video format, but it died because VHS was marginally cheaper and everyone bought
that format instead.  Apple has always had better machines and better operating
systems than IBM/Microsoft, but due to open architecture more people got on
board that train, so software was written for it, and to this day its the king
of the heap, with Apple running  a distant second.

Maybe LDoN will be the killer app for the group tool... but thus far an LFG flag
works better, and /ooc level X class Y LFG still, sadly, works best of all.

The adventures are short enough that a who isn't in your group can get to your
body afterwards and rez it.  This works in PoP, where there's usually a cleric
passing thru the GYs or at a minimum in POT and willing to be bribed to come
click you in a GY.  Whether it will work in the more spread out LDoN locations
is an open question.

High level Paladin rez is also good enough to eliminate almost all of the death
penalty; a death isn't all that huge a deal in the first place and getting 90%
back instead of 96% back means you only miss 6/100ths... since paladins make
excellent MA's for group action, a shaman/paladin core can be a very nice
alternative plan
