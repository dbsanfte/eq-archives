Exactly. To the original poster, how do you feel about the telemarketers 
who always seem to call you in the middle of dinner? They're always 
polite too; they say please. Still, I bet you find it annoying. I mean, 
you're at home, you're probably doing something else, you don't want 
what they have to sell, you didn't ask them to call you...  Get the 
picture? Do you think it's "arrogant" to wish they'd simply go away and 
leave you alone?

If you are a druid in EQ, your life is composed of the EQ equivalent of 
telemarketer calls coming in roughly every 10 minutes if you aren't 
anon. Furthermore, some of those people get really nasty when you tell 
them you can't (or won't) help them.  I once had a complete stranger 
cuss me 6 ways from Sunday because I wouldn't come from Misty Thicket to 
Freeport and PL him! I had someone train my group and me dead trying to 
get a SoW from me a couple of weeks ago. His comment when I told him 
off? "Geez, I just wanted a SoW and I just didn't know where else to 
take those when I got aggroed."  Oh, well, why didn't you say so? Being 
clueless/lost/stupid is an excellent excuse for pulling 8 red mobs onto 
a group of three people. Needless to say, he did not get a Sow, or a 
rez, or anything else. =P

Anyway, it's hardly surprising druids get testy after a bit. You want to 
have SoW on demand? I suggest you start a new character who is a druid 
or a shaman, or that you cough up the cash for a SoW potion. Otherwise, 
not having SoW is one of the disadvantages of your class; learn to live 
with it.
