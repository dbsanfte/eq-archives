Chris is right, everyone is indif in Shar Vahl, though I don't know if
you need higher faction then that to get the quests and if so, I'm not
sure which quests outsiders can do to get the faction that you need
raised.

There's a very easy quest outsiders can do in Shadeweaver's Thicket
that raises some faction, but it might just be for the guards. Gather
the Payala Fruit at the base of the payala trees (the ones with the
purple foliage I think it is, there are some right near the outside
store) and turn them in to the female merchant inside the store. For
every 4 fruit she will give you a bottle of juice. You can then take 4
juice to Chialle, a merchant just inside the Shar Vahl city proper
near the South bridge and she will give you a newbie ring. Both turn
ins offer some faction, but again I don't remember who for.
