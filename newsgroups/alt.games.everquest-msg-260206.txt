Hill Giant spawns happen at random over a large area.  If you are there 
to kill HG, then your job is to keep a portion of the area clear of PH 
mobs, and to grab HG as soon as you can when they pop.

If its busy, I wouldn't expect any HG to stay unaggroed for more than 10 
seconds.

There is no way a bard can take every HG without the active cooperation 
of everyone else in the zone, or without KSing already aggroed mobs; it 
takes far more than 10 seconds to circle the HG area!

There are places where a bard can grab up all available mobs fairly 
easily, and waiting around to grab one or two before he gets to them can 
be a fools game; for example flies in POD; these are static spawns which 
pop a predictable amount of time after death, so the bard can time his 
path to pick up everything on pop if he wants to.  Personally, I 
wouldn't, because this makes adding larva and rats inevitable, and those 
tend to be more trouble than they are worth; easier to let the area 
repop and then make the grab run when you can see its nothing but flies.
