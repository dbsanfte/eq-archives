can anyone give me info on when Verina Tomb in the third gate at Neriak
spauns and if there is any way to trigger the spaun.  I can't seem to find
her up at anytime of the
day or night,  I am camped at her spaun point  and have only seen her once
in two weeks ,  and of course I didn't have help at the time.
    thanks        Steve
