  My condolences.  Really.  However, most people have some sort of
personal tragedy they they have dealt with or are still struggling
with.  Painful circumstances do not, just by virtue of being, make the
person going through them better than anyone else.

    You know for a fact that DT doesn't have a job?  Do you assume that
everyone who has a job can afford a top of the line computer?  Do you
know about the expenses associated with having kids, the high cost of
food and gas, car payments, mortgage or rent,  credit card bills,
utilities and all the other things that many people have to deal with
rather blow it all on the cost associated with a fancy piece of
electronic equipment that will soon be obsolete?

   I cannot speak for what thoughts DT had to make him assume that were
given your system.  However, there are many people on this newsgroup who
have for various reasons mentioned what machines they are using, some of
them quite nice.  I can't say that I can recall DT ever saying "You have
_that_ kind of setup?  Must be nice to be given something like that!" 
He may have been drawing conclusions from your general lack of 
maturity, and the belief you seem to have that the majority of people
can afford higher end systems.  I personally agree that there is a basic
lack of knowledge of the "real world" when you blithely assume that
anyone that doesn't have a fancy computer pretty much doesn't matter
because _you_ have had the luxury of being able to afford one.
