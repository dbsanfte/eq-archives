You have to get one alone and not together

Fear kiting, (though you probably know it) is casting a darkness spell (I.E.
clinging darkness) then casting fear on the target causing to run away yet
be snared. This opens up some free shots and probably death IF it sticks.
There is a problem that sometimes the spells are resisted and it causes some
problems...
