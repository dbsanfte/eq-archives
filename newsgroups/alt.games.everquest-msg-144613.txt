    No, worse. The bard ran around like a lunatic, with a bunch of rock guys
after him, until he managed to get a snare to land on Rumblecrush, then got
CotH. Rumble hung around for a bit while everyone else went home, the bard
ran out and brought him back. At least that's what it looked like from my
end - I don't know that Rumblecrush is snareable, but he did hang around
while the other mobs went home and I know snare does that.

    When we have monks do it, they either stay down or get out of range so
rampage transfers to the paladin.

    You really have to be ready for his initial burst of damage, or you lose
control of rampage and healers start getting killed.
