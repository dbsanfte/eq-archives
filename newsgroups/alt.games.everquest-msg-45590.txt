I heard about her one day, and read everything I could on the net about her.
I filtered out all the crap and only 1 post made a lot of sense, based on
the way spawns work in EQ.

33 kills ( I think, notes are at home ), and 4 GBS.  Now, this percentage is
VERY high from what I have read of others camping her, so I count myself
lucky.

I -really- think the GBS is part of an unfinished quest.  Offhand, my guess
is that you end up giving it to Varsoon the Undying and he comes back to
life and gives you something in return, but that's a wild guess.  It may be
something as simple as giving it to Varsoon, since it identifies as
"Varsoon's Black Heart" ( something like that, also in my notes ).  I was
always under the impression that if you give something to a MoB who can
"use" that item, then they will have it when they die.  IE. Give a rat a
bunch of copper and it won't have it when it dies, but give a skeleton the
copper and it will ( because a SKelly can carry coin ).  If this is true,
I'm still very wary about giving one to VtU because I have read that his
race is "zombie" as opposed to "human", unlike his Varsoon ( Human SK, I
believe ) form.  I don't know if a "zombie" can have a GBS, or if it would
go *poof* if given to him.

Some day, when I'm EQ rich ( yeah, right ) and am high enough level to charm
Varsoon, I may give it a shot.  Right now, I have a Cleric to outfit.

It's a long, boring camp.  I could have gotten from level 27 to level 36 or
so easily in the time I spent there.  But, I started fishing and got that
maxxed.  I started baking, and now that's up to 142.  I even have my begging
at 92 =)

The price on the GBS is dropping by the day.  I was able to trade the first
one for a bunch of stuff for my warrior ( Crafted Greaves / Vambraces /
Gauntlets, Runic Carver [ I though it was 1-handed, duh ], Viik's Dark
Defender, Bee Stinger, Wurmslayer, Blade of Xalgoz, Platinum Fire Wedding
Ring, Mithril Breastplate, and a Glowing Velium Axe).  I sold the second one
for 5k.  I still have #3 on my Necro, and would like to trade it for a bunch
of stuff for my Cleric.  I gave the fourth one to a friend who helped me
some with her ( and kept me company on the long camps ).  I'm done with
sitting around and now it's time to get some EXP.

We ganked Hadden 4 times while we were camping Pyzzie, but no earring =(

I am also of the mind that the AC in S. Ro is -not- a random spawn.
Unfortunately, there's no way of really figuring it out, with all the people
there slaying everything in sight trying to get him to pop.  I figure he is
a normal Mob, with PHs, that has several spawn points.  He may also be time
restricted ( ie. 8pm to 6am ) like Pyzjn.  He may even be on a multiple PH
spawn table *shrug*, but I doubt it.

To camp Pyzzie the best, take a 24+ Druid - Charm animal, tracking, SoW.
All 3 help quite a bit.
