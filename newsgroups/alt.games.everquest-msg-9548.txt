Brell Serilis uses ruby. Rallos Zek uses jade.

I'm now debating allowing my wood elf warrior to worship Rallos Zek
(provided that's possible) when I restart her. Question is - what
downsides are there to having a good aligned race follow Rallos? For
instance, would I be insta-KOS in Growth or run into other faction
issues my Tunare druid avoids?
(I like roleplaying religions and would have had my treehugging mage
follow Erollisi if that had been an option, but it's nice to know the
consequences of my choices before I make them :) )
