Thank you for this reply.  My guild recently switched from a 2 week trial 
to a month trial.  We had figured that a 2 week trial would allow us to 
figure out who was a good fit and who wasn't.  We have since figured out 
that some folks are able to be on their best behavior for a 2 week trial, 
but seem to let their true colors shine once they get comfortable.  
When people are applying to high-end guilds, they generally do so so that 
they can get better gear.  Any bratty kid can behave right before 
Christmas, but it's how they act over the long run that is important.  
Since we've switched to a month trial we've had several recruits who would 
have been approved after two weeks who are most definately rejected after 
a month.  It just makes it cleaner than having to /guildremove them after 
the fact.

Very true.  Generally guilds want new recruits who fit in with the 
existing members.  If that means that all members must like 15th-century 
choral music, so be it.  A guild's invite policy is generally written to 
limit who applies.
