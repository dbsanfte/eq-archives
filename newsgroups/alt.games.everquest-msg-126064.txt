Yeah... that happens... see below...

SRo AC isn't random... if it WAS really random, you'd have seen him in that
8 hours.

As far as I know, there's 4 ways for a Mob to spawn...

#1 Fixed spawn, always pops in the same place, with a time delay respawn
anywhere from 6 minutes upwards
eg most Guards, Circle Druids, etc

#2 Random spawn table... pops anywhere in zone, random selection from a list
eg Orc Pawns in EC, Gators in Oasis

#3 Placeholder spawn... fixed... kill the placeholder for the next one on
the table to pop after a delay
eg Toxdil/Guard/Rat in West Freeport tunnel, Throneroom in Crushbone

#4 Placeholder - roaming... can be used for rare mobs to ensure it's not up
constantly.
eg Undead Cylops in SK, Grimfeather in NK

AC is a type #4, but the placeholders are often disguised... so you're never
sure if the lawn trash you've just nuked is going to help or not. I've seen
AC spawn 5 times in about 3 hours... there was a queue of about 9 peeps all
after the boots, slaughtering everything (including dervs in the camp)...
and also had him spawn on top of (and kill) my lowbie Cleric in the middle
of fighting a DB skel whilst alone in SRo.

Bear in mind Orcs fight Mummies in SRo all the time... and both are
suspected trash placeholders... so the AC might get triggered in an empty
zone, and if he survives for a set length of time, will de-pop. Just because
you can't see the last Orc die, doesn't mean it doesn't happen (and does he
make a noise?).
