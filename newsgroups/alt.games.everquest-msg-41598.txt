You expect any other response from Bitchbee?

He is just a downright unhappy and negative guy which
shows on this newsgroup.

He is pissed at the world because he is one Ugly
unsociable prick who gets picked on every day in
life so to take out his frustrations and pain he sits
his fat ass in front of his computer and proceeds to
flame anyone who in his words 'suck' heh.]

Not surprised Bitchbee, hopefully your real life
situation improves some..  I suggest plastic surgery,
and Jenny Craig.. LOL
