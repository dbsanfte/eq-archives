I haven't seen anybody comment on this in a long time (well over a year)
but I can recall several folks posting words to the effect that
partially resisted DDs seemed to get hate in proportion to the damage
done, while fully resisted DDs seemed to get hate as if they had done
full damage.  These were just anecdotal observations tho, and there've
been a lot of patches affecting hate/agro since.
