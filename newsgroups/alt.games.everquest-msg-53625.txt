Give her 55pp, she gives you a fire opal.  It's a quest-like thing.
She asks for 550 gold, but 55pp will work.

If you can find them at a merchant, they cost 52pp, 5gp.  I think.  There
are no merchants that have them as part of their normal stock, but they are
a semi-common mob drop in Sebilis, and so people sell them to merchants to
make money.  The best place to look is the outpost in FV.  Just check all
the merchants, you'll find some eventually.

You don't have to kill her.

No.
