You didn't say what level he is, so I guessed 40...

Wurm + Yak = 662 damage per minute
Mith 2 hander =  622 damage per minute

Further advantage to the Wurm/Yak combo is he can tack on a FBSS for haste,
raising his damage to 801. Since the Mith2H provides its own haste, you
cannot improve it beyond that with gear, unless you get a very top end
haste item like a PoA quest belt, or a dragon drop (Mith2H + cloak of
flames = 651 damage per minute...far worse than the wurm/yak/FBSS, and the
cloak of flames is 50 times more difficult to obtain).

Downside to the wurm is the thing is so farking heavy, that is drains out
your stamina like mad. The Wurm is really not a terribly good weapon. Plus
it looks like shit. Easily the least attractive weapon in the game.
