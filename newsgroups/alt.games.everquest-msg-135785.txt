My main complaint since the patch. I liked being able to just push ESC. 
The only time I can see when I wouldn't want to is when I'm tracking 
something and in the meanwhile I wish to raise tracking skill by opening 
the list and pushing ESC to close it while maintaining my track. Since 
that would happen so rarely, however, I want to be able to push ESC to 
stop tracking like I used to be able to.
