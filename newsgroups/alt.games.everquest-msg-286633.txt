Yep, forget the first 20 levels, just get HP, but after that if you 
really have a lot of AC then you'll get hit for minimum so much it's 
laughable.

At higher levels most tanks advocate a balanced approach, but the basic 
truism is that if you wear gear with good AC you'll have lots of 
hitpoints.  The debate centres around the choice of augs (most of the 
best AC focussed augs drop in the grouping game, while most of the best 
hitpoint augs drop in the raiding game).
