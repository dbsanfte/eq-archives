Two points: (1) the problem was mostly just with Kunark dragons and perhaps
Venril Sathir.  They could have fixed the problem by moving epic components
off those to Velious-level mobs.

(2) You've forgotten the mod rod nerf.  I understand that some kind of nerf
was needed to mod rods (a Mage and Cleric, using rods in a naive way, could
get the equivalent of around FT70...I don't know what they could do if they
used rods optimally, since I was too lazy to make my simulation handle
overlapped actions :-)).

A Wizard high enough for MB has nukes that are more efficient than MB.  It
used to be that a Wizard on a raid could MB at the start of the raid (MB is
low aggro), and then rod up and nuke normally.  Result: MB was a nice boost
in Wizard damage.  The rod nerf changed that for many (most?) encounters.
The Wizard is better off ignoring MB and just nuking.

So, the MB nerf in isolation wasn't fatal...but in combination with the rod
nerf, MB is mostly useless now, in most situations.

Level 59, 5 points plus Mental Clarity.
