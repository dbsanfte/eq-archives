It was the part about necros not being one of the top soloers cause he
didn't reference them in his comments that I found interesting. 
Personally I find necros too boring to play, but I do think they have
great soloing ability even if he didn't mention them.  I would guess he
was just trying to say that they will be able to solo, not so well as a
druid and better than an SK seems to me to read as just that, between
those two, which would lead me to assume that either necros are below SK
as you did or that they are in fact better than druids, which is what I
was sort of guessing at since I think necros would rank as better
soloers than SKs.  That's what I meant by interesting, the way each of
us interpreted the comment was different even though we read the same
thing.

Personally I find my shaman even easier to solo than my druid and I
think that's what it comes down to, personal tastes and
ability/creativity.  Even a druid is gonna have a hard time if the
player is an idiot and any other class can solo to some extent if the
player uses the tools provided and some imagination.
