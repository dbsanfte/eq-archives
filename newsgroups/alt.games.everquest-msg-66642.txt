Good question - and a little disappointing, to be honest.  As a
non-porting, boat-hating kinda guy, I like having some more options
for getting around the world with SoL (go up to the moon from one
spires, back down to another).  Sure, it ain't quick... but I don't
have to pay anyone to do it nor suffer on the boats.  Wish I could get
to somewhere near Thurgadin the same way!
