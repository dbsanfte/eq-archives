Actually, from what I hear, the BST warders are actually worth
worrying about when going up against a BST in PVP. Of course, I don't
do PVP, so I don't know that for sure. And the pet's pretty easily
dealt with by most classes, anyway. (Fear, root, whatever)

And, uh, just being on SZ is a severe disadvantage IMO. >< Playing on
there is about like slamming my head into a door repeatedly.
