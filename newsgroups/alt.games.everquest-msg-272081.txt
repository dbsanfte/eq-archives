Chances of getting chests seem to be about equal, per actual mob killed 
of getting a chest from group or solo mobs.  It seems rare soloing, but 
consider, in a group there are up to 6 people who are sharing those 
chests, while soloing there is just one person getting the chest.  My 
experience up to level 20 anyway, seems to show that I get about the same 
number of chest drops where I get something from it whether grouped or 
soloing.
