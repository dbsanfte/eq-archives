Would like to add...

You are right.  I enjoyed the games while they were going on.  It was like a
little drama to spice up a boring life, and Everquest itself.  But she
enjoyed the games, too.  She perpetuated them instead of telling me to get
lost for good.  Surely an exhausting experience, and one I won't do again.

And as far as chasing her around after the relationship was over, lol, I
would only send her an occasional tell hello or try to greet her the few
times she /q out on me.  Sure I was annoying, but I don't think that was
"chasing".  Again, why not just say Get Lost!?  I have a hard time buying it
was because she was "so nice".

It can be written off as disinterest on her part and stalking on mine to
someone who didn't see what I saw.  I saw a woman leading me on, trying to
have me present when she had no one else to play the game with.  In one
mail, when I asked her what the hell it was she was looking for in me
exactly, she responded, "a friend or...something".

She got the "something" and wanted to keep the friend around for later
"somethings".  I was dumb enough to fall for it, and to feel pity for her
and her life.
