I find it strange that anyone who doesn't whine like a spoiled child
is an "apologist" or guilty of "rationalizing".

I looked at the situation from all sides, and I came to the "rational"
conclusion that a $3,00 increase in the monthly subscription rate is
not the end of the world. Further I think EQ is still a great value at
the new price.

I am sorry that you find yourself "taking it up the ass" in order to
earn that extra $3.00 a month. You might want to consider a new line
of work.
