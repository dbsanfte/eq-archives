My count thus far from complete strangers:

Male Dark Elf SK - Two items
Male Dwarf Paladin - One item, 150pp
Female High Elf Enchanter - One item

Both male characters were untwinked at the time, female was mildly 
twinked at the time.

So far, from my statistically insignificant sample, I'd have to say that 
untwinked low levels get more than other characters, regardless of 
gender.
