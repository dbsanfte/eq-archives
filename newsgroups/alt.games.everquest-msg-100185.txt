The GF4 mx460 actually replaces the Geforce2's not the Geforce3 cards. It is
NOT faster than any of the GF3's (ti200, original and ti500)
The GF4's that will be (are) faster are the ti4400 and ti4600.

Obviously the best card for EQ (or any game) will be the fastest of the
bunch, the GF4 ti4600 in this case.
The "best" card for you is the one that fits your budget, in my case a std,
cheap brand, GF3 with blue orb on GPU and heatsinks on the ram, then oc'd.

The GF3's handle most things comfortably but this will change soon with
newer games start demanding more powerful hardware.
