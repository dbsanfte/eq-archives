Interesting thread on Graffes that linked to a list somebody put
together of the toughest mobs in the game. (Sadly, it started as more of
a dickwaving contest between guilds... I know you're surprised...) but
an interesting list none the less. Of course, not being in an
o00berguild, nor playing much on Luclin at all, I haven't even heard of
half these bastards, say nothing of seen them.

But what do you think? See any glaring errors? Here they are from
toughest to easiest, at least according to one person's opinion on
Karana.
