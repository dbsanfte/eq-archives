Am I the only one who considers official forums a much better source
of info than "official sites"?  I've never even started to look for
the realm status page.  Forums are almost always the best place to
look for any current info, because even if there is no official word,
there will at least be people talking about it.

This isn't really useful for the conversation at hand, but it does
seem like some people are asserting that they didn't even know the
forums existed.  Am I odd in that forums are one of the first things I
look for in a new online game?
