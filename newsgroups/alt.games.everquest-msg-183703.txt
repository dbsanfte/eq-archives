However, on the last stop, you can combine the box, then buy another of 
the item you just bought (may have to exit and enter the vendor a couple 
times).  Saves a run each time.  I alternate between FV, because it's 
the longest/most dangerous run (depending on whether I go BBM/TLer route 
or book/ewspiders route), and Bazaar, because the lag there makes me 
want to scream.

And last I checked in, which was admittedly awhile ago, the troll 
selling the bundle of weapons still hadn't checked into Neriak, so my 
Nova couldn't do the quest.

I should sue them for not getting the time to get Nova a couple levels 
;p
