I'd move Feerrott up to at least decent if not higher, especially since they
added the bears and later added more low level lizards when they revamped
CT.  Tho, I have to say, I'm a bit bias.  My very first character was an
Ogre and Feerrott was the first zone introduced to me for hunting.  It's
nostalgic to me, I still love running thru the zone.
