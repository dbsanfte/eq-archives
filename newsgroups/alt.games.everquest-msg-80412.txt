OMG, do you know when it will be released??? I was wondering if they would
even bother, before #3 was up and gone. Hopefully they'll have it out as
fast as every other movie these days -- 3 months avg, I think! I just hope
the cutting room floor will give us more of Legolas! He had very little part
in this one, but according to The Twin Towers (novel), he has a bit more of
a speaking part... if Peter Jackson holds true, in any case.

Going to see it again this afternoon... 8th time. It stays thru Thursday, so
will likely have time to memorize the dialog that I haven't so far... though
there isn't much of THAT left ;)
