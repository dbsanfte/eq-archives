Yeah, it has potential...up until the time Everquest 2 comes out.   I
guess SWG is a good game for those who finished EQ and left out of
boredom.  However, I couldn't justify buying this game because I still
play EQ and want to keep my characters, plus I also want to play EQ 2
when it comes out.   The problem is paying for like 2 or 3 MMORPGs
when I barely have time to play one.  Too many are flooding the market
these days and many people don't want to abandon the characters
they've worked so hard to level up.  That's why I will skip this one
altogether and save that hassle.
