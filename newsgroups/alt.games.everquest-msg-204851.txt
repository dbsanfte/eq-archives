Having done the epic several times (for self and for friends), i would
strongly recommend getting max ally.  I also can assure you that you can
skip all the parts as it is entirely faction based.  You have to have the
tear from fear, but if you just do pages and books you will have done
enough.  The Black Dire boots are great for the cast from inventory sow,
other then that, skip the Hole completely as I've seen many people die
trying the attempt and also getting items eaten for not having enough
faction.  Unless of course you have a chanter that is working on epic then
take a couple of groups down and do it :p
