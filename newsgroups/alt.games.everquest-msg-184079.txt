Who says a skill has to be hard? Making a good omelette for example is a 
skill, and some people find that easier than touch typing. Others will 
never make a decent omelette.

It's both, but thanks for coming down from on high to lecture us mortals.

So that would be knowledge, in other words.

So it is only a skill if you research it? So did you have to research 
strafe-bombing in Quake?

Hah! I do EQ math all the time, figuring out weapon modals and ratios. Not 
to mention the amount of log parsing I do.

I agree. There's a lot more to both.

In the context of EQ, which falls firmly into that grey area, they may as
