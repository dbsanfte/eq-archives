I play on several computers and only one of mine had the problem with
the gamma correction being inoperable.  I have an ATI card in this
computer.   I read this problem was due to an older video driver.
I've installed the new video driver but the servers came down before I
could test it.  If you have an ATI card and are having the gamma
problem you might want to see if you have the latest driver.
