    I certainly won't expect to get a promotion over someone that's been
there longer, or to get a raise above a long-time employee in that first
month. Your choice of analogy seems to indicate the flaw in your thinking,
though....

> Or maybe theres some subtle difference im failing to pick up here.

    There is. You don't get "paid" for raiding by getting a chance at an
item, you get "paid" by GETTING an item. No raider in his right mind is
going to say, "Well I've been on 40 raids in our 40 person guild, and I got
nothing but I got the chance at something so that's good enough." They want
to see the loot, please!

    Well, as you might have noticed, loot drops on a raid are generally less
in number than the number of raiders. So after raid one, the guild has
"paid" three people and "owes" loot to 37 people. After raid two, six people
are owed a lesser amount, and 34 a greater amount. When you come along,
everyone there that's helped build the guild is still owed for their work in
making the guild function. Why should you jump the line of people waiting to
get "paid" and get something ahead of them?

    At this point I wish you would get into a guild run along the guidelines
you seem to favour. It might be amusing to see your perspective change once
you start going on raid after raid and getting nothing because a constant
stream of newcomers "gets lucky" and gets stuff you would want. Then you
might realize that the chance to get rewarded for hard work isn't what
motivates people, it's the actual reward. Otherwise you might as well pay
those employees at that "next job" with lottery tickets and scratch cards.

    James
