I would both join the same guild. I have been in several guilds where
parents and childern play together. If you dont mind me asking, what
server are you two playing on? 

As for tradekskills, my fiancee and I play together all the time. When
it came time to choose tradeskills, she became a scribe and I chose to
be a craftsman. I can make the paper and the quills that she uses to
make the spells. It has worked out rather nicely, and we both make a
nice profit from it as well.
