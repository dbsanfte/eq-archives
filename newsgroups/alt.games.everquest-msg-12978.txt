	Heh.  I always found the ticking rather soothing, personally.

	In the middle part of Ak'Anon, just past the Cleric/Rogue
guild, the lake turns into a series of stepped waterfalls.  Just past
the waterfall is a small island in the middle of the pool.  There's a
bridge connecting this little island with the main part of Ak'Anon.

	Sometimes, I'd take my little gnome warrior to that little
island and just sit down for a while and listen to the roar of the
waterfall and the ticking of the city.  It was very peaceful and
relaxing, and always made me glad to be a Gnome.  Once, I even fell
asleep in my chair while listening to the background noise of Ak'Anon.

	AB
