At lower levels, perhaps.  CH is the cheapest heal my cleric ever has

Glass half full, eh?  Too bad you're not so optimistic about your cleric's

because "time is running out" should have realized that time started running
out when time started running and played accordingly.

Yeah, by you, much to the puzzlement of anyone else reading I'm sure.

silly.
