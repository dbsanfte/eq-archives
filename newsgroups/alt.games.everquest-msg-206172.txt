Kind of what I thought.

It seems like I can run across fine steel or velium weapons to sell.  I 
also run across (more frequently) trade skill items that I can sell in the 
bazaar.  But I have yet to hear someone who is like 44, soloing and finding  
loot that sells for 100's.  Unless it's very rare - like a forest loop.

Anybody have better ideas where to hunt for loot?
