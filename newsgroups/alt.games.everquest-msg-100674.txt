A druid isn't necessary for evac though.  Wizards work just as well
for that AND the bring a hell of a lot more damage output.  And in
many cases, you only really need evac for something like if things go
pear shaped on the break in Fear.

In many cases, DoTing raid level mobs is bad.  Just means that I'm
going to be summoned and have my delacate little body pounded on,
particularly if I'm using my new fire DoT, which is also a debuff.

Light heals (patching up casters when they take a couple hits, nothing
drastic), and nukes are more in line with what a druid is going to be
doing on a raid.
