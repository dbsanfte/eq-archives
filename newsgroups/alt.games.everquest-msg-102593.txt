It depends on when the character has been deleted...  Also, the gear gotten
back on it depends on them doing some investigation into it.  From what I
heard...  GMs cannot restore a characters over a week or so old, due to
their backups getting overwritten.  Also, NEVER create a character with the
same name, it will overwrite the backups with that character.

What is important, is to do your request right away, and keep doing it
every day until you hear from a GM.  Doing once, and then assuming they
will do something about it will NOT work, since they don't keep a petition
for to long and they can't log every petition submitted.

This isn't because they don't care, remember, their CS is trying to handle
1k+ players on line at any given time, and they do get a petition from
players at anytime.  Not necessarily 1k+ players at once, but even a
fraction of that player base petitions, that is a lot of petitions to go
through and also the time to interact with them eats away too.
