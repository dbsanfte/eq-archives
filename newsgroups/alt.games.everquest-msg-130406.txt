Exactly. Even though they throw a lot nastier things
at police in Belfast, who's vehicles carry rather less
armour than tanks or APCs. Even when the British Army
was there they didn't drive around Northern Ireland 
going through any civilian building which got in the
way. Even after the IRA came close to killing most of
the British government nothing like what is happening
in the West Bank was seen in Northern Ireland. 

If Israel were serious about dealing with terrorists
they'd probably be better off using police (possibly
paramilitary police) than an army. Soldiers typically
make very poor policemen.
