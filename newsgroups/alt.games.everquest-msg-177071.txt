Closest I can think of is master looting - where one person with the
biggest capacity is the main looter picks it all up and then splits the
cash gained, evenly hands out the quetable loot and sells the ret to the
nearest vendor and splits that. You dont get the problems of the autosplit
and its unevenness that way.

I personally would only use it in a group of people I know or who vouch
for the members - I've been stung by the system too much. THey still
should have a) told you and explained what it meant when you went 'huh'
and b) the warrior shouldnt have been grabbing the bodies when they hit
the deck, but when the room was clear.
