Split Paw is a special case.  Almost nobody goes past the entry area
except to get the tiny handful of special drops further in, and they
usually flee the zone forever as soon as they get those.  When RvR is
broken in a negative direction players flee, just as surely as they
flock when it's broken in a positive direction.

No, it's more a case of sticking with the easy meat rather than learning
how to beat a new challenge.  Under the old xp rules the slow pace would
goad almost everybody into leaving, under the new rules the reward for
bottomfeeding is better and so more people do it.

Nor do I.  I made the (fairly obvious) observation:
"Risk reduced + reward increased = easier to progress"
and responded to the objections and comments you have made in reply.
