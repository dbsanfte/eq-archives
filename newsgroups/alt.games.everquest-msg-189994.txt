Yes, easily. My newest character is level 14 and getting close to 
2K plat worth of cash and gear, all earned himself. I started this 
one on a new server (for me) specifically so I could not succumb to 
the urge to twink & PL like so many times before.

While a few hundred of that came from looted items like silks, most
of it was profit from digging through NPC merchant inventories for 
easily-resellable goodies, mostly tradeskill components. That becomes 
an art form in itself after a while -- being able to open up a merchant 
inventory and quickly scan it for icons that might indicate something 
interesting.

On this subject, I want a checkbox in my options for "Do not display 
items spawned in Paludal Caverns in merchant inventories". That bronze 
brigandine and fungal fiend crap is *everywhere*.
