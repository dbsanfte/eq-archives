Probably not, Rumble.  =)

MoK is Mark of Karn, a level 56 cleric spell.  Basically, I cast it on a
mob, and every time you (or anyone) hits the mob, you get healed a tiny bit.
That's why it's called a reverse damage shield.

Since only clerics can cast it - and more specifically, only 56+ clerics can
cast it - the intended audience is high-level clerics.  And most folks 56 or
higher have quite probably heard of the Halls of Testing in the Temple of
Vesheen.

Of course, acronyms vary across servers.  Once I was grouping with a necro
in Sebilis who had evidently moved his nekkid character to Drinal.  During
some downtime, some /ooc'd "Camp check".  Someone answered "PLA", and he
asked "Where's PLA?"  We had to tell him, "Um, you're *in* PLA."  PLA on
Drinal stands for "Phat Lewts Area" (a bit of a misnomer these days, but the
acronym persists) in Sebilis.  Where this necro had come from, it was called
the Crypt.

So maybe HoT isn't called HoT on your server.  Maybe it's called EToV (East
Temple of Vesheen) or LGLA (Let's Get Lotsa Armor) or something.  =)
