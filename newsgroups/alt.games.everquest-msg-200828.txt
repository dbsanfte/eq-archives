Yes, but think of all the sympathy you can get from people when
you tell them about all the pain you experience from your <Carpal
Tunnel Syndrome | Repetitive Stress Injury>.

And think of the bragging rights!  "Yeah, my wrists will never
be the same, but I have a 48 bard on E'ci!  Woot!"

I wish I had a crystal ball and could see the design meetings:

"The bard class is overpowered."
"Yeah, you're right.  Lets just make it physically punishing and
not enough people will play bards to matter."

-Ed <--- Who *still* thinks "balancing" the bard class by making
         it physically punishing was a stupid design choice.

P.S. Ya, ya, save all your "I've never had a problem with it"
     posts for /dev/null.  I'm not interested.
