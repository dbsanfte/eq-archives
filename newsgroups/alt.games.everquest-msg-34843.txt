Three very nice choices the Skels at the Druid Ring in Butcher Block, give
good xp a regular spawn and the bone chips can be sold for very nice pp.
Second NRo should give plenty of xp well beyond 10 as will parts of East
Commons.  Finally try the Qeynos Hills area or Misty Thicket.  These are all
generally less crowded than Crushbone have fewer trains and give similar xp.
The downside is they take some planning to take advantage of, require a bit
of travel and are not a popular or as crowded as areas like CB.  They too,
however, offer quests that offer xp at least as good as the belts and pads
quest in CB and do not require you to deal with the problems of that area.
