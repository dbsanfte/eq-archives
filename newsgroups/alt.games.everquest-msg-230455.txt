Oh, I disagree with this.  Maybe there's accountability to each other, but
as for accountability to their members who are not RL friends, it just
doesn't happen.  I've been in a situation like this, and from my own
experience I can tell you that they do form a clique, even if they don't
realize it, and there's no way if you don't know them IRL that you'll ever
enter that clique.  And if you're not in that clique, you can pretty much
forget about receiving equal treatment to those who are.

I was in a guild where one guy was an officer, and his RL wife was a fellow
member.  Do you honestly think that there would ever be a dispute between a
member and his wife that he would be able to adjudicate fairly?  That any of
his officer friends could adjudicate fairly?

How about enforcing rules consistently?  If your real life friend does
something that would get an ordinary member either booted or sanctioned, are
you going to come down on your RL friend as harshly?  Even if it might
strain your friendship?  Even if it means you might not be able to use his
condo in Aspen this year?  Over an incident in a video game?  Where the only
negative in not doing it is that someone 1000 miles away whose real name you
don't even know might feel hurt?

It's really a small hypocrisy that lots of people are willing to live with.
