Welll, it was based on something someone here posted and so I killed SE last
night and installed the original version and I'm still having the problem,
so the most recent reason is moot.

I can't remember the other reasons...I fiddle with PCs at work all the
time...the only thing SE seems to have going for it is the ICS.  I've had
trouble getting CD-ROM drives detected on SE where I didn't have any problem
at all on 98.  Just piddly stuff mostly.  I'd EASILY prefer to have SE over
ME though...that sucker is flaky.
