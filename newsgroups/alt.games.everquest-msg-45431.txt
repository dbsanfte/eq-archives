Another approriate question to ask is how this guy is measuring his xp
so exactly.  How did you manage that, Winston? You need to kill a *lot*
of skellies to go from level 9 to level 10, etc. Each kill moves the old
blue xp bar up a smidgen. 
 Could you post your research results and how you obtained the numbers?
Are you running ShowEQ?
