Actually I use the following macro for assisting:

1) Target the person I'm going to assist manually (by clicking their name in
the group box)
2)  Macro is as follows:

line 1) /g assisting %T in combat!
line 2) /assist %T
line 3) /em Bashes %T over the head with his fists.

This does 2 things:
Allows me to change assist targets dynamically without having to constantly
re-type my macro

Allows the group to know what I attacked so if I'm on the wrong target
(tanks sometimes switch) they can tell me.\
