Hi,
Contacted GM about how my screen was freezing just for a few seconds every
now and again especially after zoning - the answer was that my computer and
graphics card determine the how the game responds on screen.

I have a Sony pc which is six months old Everquest already installed! and
use a cable modem at full speed. Don't know the full spec but I know its
very good.

I decided to switch servers from Kane Bayle to Tunare (no reason just
thought I would give it a try) and guess what? there is no freezing. Not
sure if anyone else has ever had this, just the fact that my game play was
always spoiled by this frustrating problem.
