Subject: Bandits in the canyons in East Karana gone??

I have ran down the canyon in East Karana 4 times since last patch and it
appears that the Bandits have abandon their posts in the towers.  Has anyone
else noticed this?  It is sorta of a bummer because if I was running thru to
get to Everfrost or Qeynos I would always stop to kill them.  Killing the three
of them usually got at least one bandit sash that would be worth 2-4 pp,
depending on what Chesgard Sydwen gave to you for turning them in.  It
depresses me that such a simple, quick way, that I used to make some tiny loot
is now gone.
