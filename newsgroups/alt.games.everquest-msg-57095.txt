Notice I said I am in the UK and it's AOL *UK* I was talking about.

I bet you are in North America ?. Here in the UK we do not have free
local loop calls, we pay through the nose for them. AOL was the *only*
ISP in the UK offering unmetered net access for a flat monthly fee
with no cut off period. Ideal for online gamers!. Nobody here actually
used any of the AOL services, we just minimised their crap and used
our normal preferred programs. That's what they've now screwed us out
of. Hope that makes it clear. It's was the only reason UK online
gamers used it for EQ, DAoC etc. otherwise we'd be running up *huge*
'phone costs. If you get your local loop calls for free you're a lucky
man indeed. We are not all so fortunate. It's even worse in some other
European countries where they start to pay as soon as they lift the
phone and get the dial tone, so even if the number is engaged, or
rings out, they are still paying. As I said you're a lucky man if you
live in the US as far as telecommunications choices are concerned.
