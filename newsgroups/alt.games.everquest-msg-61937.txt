"Zymyool" amused me no end by writing:

You sir are a pompous pedantic bureacrat, you probably design tax return
forms for a living and have a colour coded sock draw.
In that exchange the 'd00d' might be guilty of lazy typing but you are rude,
arrogant, obnoxious, obtuse, smug and self-satisfied in a way only little
hitlers like you can be.
Instead of simply saying to him "Your improper use of the english language
offends me so i shant buff you" you decide to dick him around for no other
reason than to amuse yourself and gain a little 'victory'.
A server for those like you should most definately come online so the rest
of us can just get on with playing and enjoying the game.

> Seriously, what pisses you off the most about EQ?
Without a shadow of a doubt people like yourself.
I remember now why I quit this NG before.
