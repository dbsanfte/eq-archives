Define better gameplay.  The game will be the same, though there is
supposed to be more GM interaction, and a much higher number of GM
events.

It's the same game, just more GMs, and more GM run events.

It's coming to all servers, though they are working on a GUI for it.
I would have been perfectly happy with a command-line interface, but
I've long since realized that the majority requires a GUI to operate
anything.

Exactly.  Or you like the idea of a more interactive and changing
worldscape.

I am thinking that those who have been complaining about the lack of a
truly interactive world, one where your character can change the
direction of the story, should jump on this with all due haste.  I
also think that those who are excited about the idea of Neverwinter
Nights should at least try this.  I am hoping that Verant hires GMs
with experience as DMs, who know how to tell a story, and with a lot
more CS skills than the average GM to support the new servers.
If this takes off, and Verant doesn't fuck it up, this could be a
great thing for roleplayers.  I keep seeing all the negatives, but I
haven't seen a single person mention anything about the interaction,
and the increase in GM events, and all the things that should be able
to be better on this server.
Some of those yelling the loudest about this are the same people who
bitch about how they refuse to take part in GM events, because they
are nothing but newbie slaughters.  I've only taken part in 3 GM
events, so maybe my experiences are unique, but I have yet to die in a
GM event.  I never got any great loot in a GM event, but I did have a
great time playing along.  I hear all the horror stories about how GM
events are ruined by the ill-mannered sub-humans who think it's fun to
nuke the main character, or to pull a train of whatever high-level mob
they can find, or to start talking sex to the GM character or whatever
other anti-social scheme they can devise.  I would hope that on
servers with a much higher GM concentration, and with regular GM
events, that these people would quickly realize that they behavior is
absolutely unacceptable on this server.  If for no other reason than
that, I truly hope this server succeeds, and give those who really
value RP a place to be.
I most likely won't be moving my characters over, since for me there
is still a LOT to do on the regular servers.  I don't think that I
need a huge backstory to want to kill dragons in VP or ST (never trust
a dragon I say, they feel to their very core that they are the supreme
beings on Norrath, and have no feelings for other sentinent beings).
I understand the economics involved, and really don't think there is
any way for Verant to provide this level of service for the
$9.89/month that regular accounts cost.  I don't disparage Verant for
that, and I think this is a reasonable compromise.  They will take a
bunch of heat, and most likely will suffer endless attacks on how
their CS has suffered because of this, no matter what the facts are.
I'm sure a better solution would be to sell mini-server modules to
allow people to GM their own games, but I suspect that the costs to
rewrite to engine to allow this would make it much, much more
expensive, plus the cost of hardware and bandwidth and all the other
ancillary costs.
