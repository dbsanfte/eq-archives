You didn't get my point at all, did you?

I did *not* open up the debate on human rights - it's been going on
without me, for quite a few posts now.

What I *did* do was comment on what I feel is a category
mistake being made by the poster here, who addressed
AI's status as a _moral_ authority.

All that is necessary, for the discussion that was going on
here before I added to it, is to assess AI's status as
a *reliable witness*.

In a trial, a witness doesn't have to prove that he is *moral*,
he just has to say what he saw, and if the witness cannot
be proved unreliable and prone to lying, his testimony is
taken into account.

It doesn't matter whether the witness is a drunk, or a
bigamist, or sleeps around - it only matters whether
he is telling the truth or not.

Is that better for you now?

And, no, I will not start another thread to continue the
discussion that has already begun in this thread - especially
not just because *you* think I'm off topic now.
