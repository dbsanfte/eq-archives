Of course the stuff could be for undiscovered quests.
VI do consistantly say that not all quests have been discovered and
there seems to be an assumption by players that everything is known and
available on the web.

All that said I agree that VI should test all the quests that they have
implemented now and ensure that they can be completed and offer
reasonable reward for the effort. I expect that they will start doing
this immediatly that SOL is released.
