Recently (Post patch) I was working on tinkering, doing combines which 
cost me 45pp or so, I could sell the successes back for 38pp and change.

Profitable?  Not at all, not even discounting fails.

Not worth selling successes?  Nope, each success only cost me 7pp, 
versus fails which cost me 45pp.

Because of this, it was also worth sticking a little closer to my 
trivial level; instead of something 100points higher than my skill 
level, which I'd fail almost always, it was better to use something only 
20 points away, so I'd succede a lot and get more of the money I spent 
on components back.

Of course it also helps that tinkering is done in tinkering kits, not on 
a ground unit, so that there were no "few steps" involved.

Way back when I was doing smithing (a long time before the recent nerf, 
or even the one that lowered trivials levels) I took two smiths up into 
the 150 or so range.  One destroyed or gave away all the banded, the 
other (poorer), sold banded to the vendor, or to players at roughly what 
the vendor would pay.  Hundreds of pp difference over the banded 
range... the former character was higher level and it wasn't worth the 
hundreds of pp to bother worrying about it.  But to the latter one, it 
very much was worth the extra time and effort hauling the stuff over to 
the vendor, with SOW and Yaulp and reckless strength to help me move 
while that badly overloaded.

Splendid
