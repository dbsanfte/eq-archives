April Fools joke?

At level 40 you should be pretty danged close to 170 INT minimum.  That's 30
INT (240 mana) more than you have now (1200).

Buffs:  Augmentation on a full group (except people who never should get
hit, like wizards), 540 mana every 27 minutes.
          Clarity on casters (average of 4 per group), 300 mana every 27
minutes

Buffs alone take 70% of your mana pool.  At 170 INT it's 58% leaving you a
HELL of a lot better off when you get to the next section. Unless you force
your group to fart around while you med up, here's what you're looking at:

Per fight with 360 mana left:
Slow - 100 per attempt
Mez - 85 per attempt (if any)
Root - 80 per attempt (if you don't use Immobilize as your primary root,
you're freaking nuts)

Assuming no adds and the critter's not particularly mad at you, you're in
pretty good shape (260 after Slow).  Add even one critter and things are
starting to look a little more interesting (down to 175 mana).  If that
critter resists your first mez it starts getting scary so you root (down to
95), back up, and mez him (down to 10 mana).  Obviously this is simplified
but you won't have any more than 100 mana tops at this point.

If there's another Add and your group is in serious trouble, and no good
enchanter ever has trouble with 3 average adds on an average pull.

In regards to charisma, my level 57 enchanter regularly has only 115 CHA and
had no more problems than usual mezzing stuff in Fear this weekend, charming
giants in the ice house in Kael (a semi-tough area if you're doing the Dain
cycle) or hunting in The Grey (typically kind of annoyingly magic
resistant).  At level 40, yes, you'll probably want more than 115 CHA
because you have a lot more "red" to you than I do, and it's supposed to
help there, but I REALLY wouldn't bother with more than 170-180 after buff.

Eh, final word...when you get to be in your 50s AC and HP are more important
than INT to a point but 140 INT is still insanely low in all but a very tiny
percentage of encounters.
