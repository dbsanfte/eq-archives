What CK just wrote is 100% pure grade A bullshit.

(quoting another post)
"Even GMs dont give a sh.. if you lose items/plat. After a servercrash I had
lost a gem-inlaid-longsword (btw most people on luclin lost items/ complete
equip too this time)... they wanted me to prove where/when I have got this
item with log and people that have been with me ... would be interesting to
prove it if you have lost a few thousand pps..... They will tell you they
have no access to logs of your char and you ll have to live with the
situation ... I for my part never will rely on a GM/guide anymore, even less
have trust in the programmers (every human can make mistakes).
(/quoting another post)

I know from personal experience that this is completely false.  E'ci crashed
while I was looting my corpse, and I had to petition over lost items.   Not
only did they not demand (my) logs and witnesses, when I offered to supply a
witness who was knowledgeable about my gear, the GM told me directly that it
was not necessary, they had thier own internal logs that they were checking.
All they needed to know is generally when the crash happened, and what zone
I was in at the time.

After some quick checking (once the GM got to the scene it was quick... just
took forever for him to get there.) the GM appologized for the delay, and
handed me a bag containing everything I had lost.   Two pieces of no-drop
armor, and my backpack containing my resist gear and Cobalt Bracer.

It may have taken (IMO) unreasonably long, (the server was crashing
regularly at the time, so I suppose they were busier than normal.) but not
once over those two+ weeks did I talk to even one guide who was anything
less than sympathetic.   None of them even hinted that they might not
escalate the petition, and several went above and beyond, letting me know
what they were doing, between posting on the "Needs GM attention" guide
message board, up to and including directly discussing the situation with
the GM.
