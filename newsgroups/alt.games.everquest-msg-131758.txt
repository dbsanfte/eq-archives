Time to brush up on your reading comprehension....

First off the original poster posted to an EQ newsgroup requesting
information about performance issues with EQ and WinXP. I am a tech,
and I know for a fact that EQ runs better overall on Win98SE. EQ has
MANY problems with soundcards when running under Win2K/XP, and anyone
contemplating an upgrade needs to take that into consideration. All of
the major benchmarking programs show Win2K/XP to be slower than
Win98SE on all tests that indicate gaming performance.

I said..."If Win98 is tuned and working well for someone they have
NOTHING to gain by going to 2000 or XP". 

I stand behind that statement. 

WinXP is a $200-300USD upgrade depending on which version you buy and
where you buy it. A *LOT* of older hardware does *NOT* have full
driver support under WinXP. Many older games/apps fail to load or run
under WinXP (even when using Win9X compatibility mode). Many
experienced users (like myself) dual-boot our systems in order to play
older games or run older apps.

Cosmetically WinXP has many differences to Win98SE. Unless the user is
familiar with NT/2K they will have a tough time at first finding
common utilities due to differences in location and naming. It won't
take too long to figure most of it out, but there is a learning curve
involved.

The average home user does not need the advanced networking or
security functions provided by Win2K/XP, if Win98SE meets thier
current needs. If a new 2K/NT users loses thier admin password, or
screws something up while logged in as Admin they are hosed. There are
no "easy" cracks to get back into the OS once you have buggered the
security.

Win2K/XP take up a *MUCH* larger memory footprint, and use more
resources than Win98SE (some of this is mitigated by better memory and
resource management). If a user has a low-mid level machine it is
likely that they will see a significant drop in overall system
performance. If that is the case, it isn't much of an "upgrade" now is
it?

Since you brought it up....

I am a tech. I support more than 130 PCs and Servers. Half of the PCs
are Win98SE, and the other half are a mix of Win2K/XP.

I *KNOW* how to properly setup a Win98SE box, and the ones in my
office are just as stable as the Win2K/XP machines. In fact when
dealing with Novell networks and clients they are *faster.

If you use/support Win98SE machines, and you are plagued with
stability problems, you should take a hard look at what you "think"
you know. 

If you encourage people to upgrade without first carefully weighing
the pros and cons you are doing a *HUGE* disservice them and to
yourself. 


*The Novell Netware client does not run efficiently on Win2K/XP, and
there is an obvious and noticable "lag" when opening or browsing
network resources.
