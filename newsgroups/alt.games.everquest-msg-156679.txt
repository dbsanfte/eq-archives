You know, we Pallys used to be known for being the biggest whiners.  I think
we're going to have to give up that trophy.  Wizards are bitching up a storm
with this one.  They have godlike damage output, and a small nerf has them
whining.  So you have no flippin HP or Melee, so what?  YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO!  Paladins have no useful nukes, no DOT's, and no ability to do damage
from a distance.  You guys are great soloers (and don't bring up the damn
"necros do it better" crap, that's what necros do, that's all they are),
great in groups, and a major factor in raids.  You were before manaburn, you
still are now.

It's odd, the class that really has been unfairly impacted by the quad-nerf
is the clerics via the mod rods.  I haven't heard a tenth of the whining
that I have from wizards.

Whether you think the nerf is just or not, don't sit her saying that your
class is broken now.  That's just insulting to those of us who have to get
along with far less.
