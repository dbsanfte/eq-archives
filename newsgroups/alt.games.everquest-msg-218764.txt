Hi all,

I'm thinking about investing in a second account, so that I can two-box with
my ranger when I cant get a group. So just a couple of questions for people
who run this set-up.

First off, what would people recommend as a two-boxed partner for a ranger?
I guess I'm between a cleric, shaman, druid, or chanter? Maybe even a bard?
I've been told that I can program a gamepad to twist for me, and I guess I
would only need two twists (slow/haste/regen, and regen/mana/mana).

Secondly, how easy is it to powerlevel with a ranger? What is the best way
to do this? Should I be asking for help from my guild to powerlevel my new
toy?

Thirdly, If your going to recommend a class, could you recommend some twink
gear as well? I've got a fair idea of what I'd get for a cleric and a
chanter, but I've not played a shaman or druid above about level 20...

Thanks,
    Andy.
