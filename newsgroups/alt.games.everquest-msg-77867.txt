Wizard pets can be killed by AOE, and in fact are rarely cast in an
AOE environment for that very reason; apparantly if the pet is
killed the wizard takes damage on top of what he just took from
the AOE itself!

On the other hand (haven't checked this out) it looked to me like
the pets listed there are buffable only by the caster?  If so, a wizard
isn't going to be able to do a heck of a lot to help his pet survive...
