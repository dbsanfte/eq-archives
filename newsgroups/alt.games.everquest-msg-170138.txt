Here's my thoughts

Gandalf solos the Balrog... Ding! ooo new Robe and staff!! LEET! ... ooo 
and got the name change petition to go through to a full GM... what a 
lucky bastard!!

Into about the first 15 minutes of the movie... Gimli just said twice as 
much as he did in this film than he did in the last one. Cool!!

If anyone tosses MY dwarf, they're gonna have to go elsewhere for a rez.

I didn't know Arwen was a high elf cleric with a 96 rez.

You know someone is going to demand that sliding on the shield thing as 
an AA ability.

Go on, Frodo, kiss Sam. You know you want to.

And I really really loved the Ents. Really.
