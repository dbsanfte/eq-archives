There are a couple high end quests in the game that drive this
bizzar bazaar behaviour.  The coldain shawl quests, when you
follow them up to 7th or 8th level, yeild arguably the best shoulder
item in the game for some classes.  To complete the quest, though,
you need to make some combines of drop items that are annoying
to get, using a variety of trade skills.  In order to reduce your
failure rate, you get the underlying skills waaaaaay up, over 150 at
least.   To do so, though, takes in many cases dropped components.
One route to smithing skill goes thru Fine Steel, which means leather
padding.  While its quite possible to collect your own pelts and
spiderling silks for this, its simply faster and probably a better use
of your time to purchase them, spending the time you would have
spent hunting instead killing exp mobs or ones that are far more
lucrative per hour than the spiderlings and lowbie animals.

Another powerful quest is the POTC/earring one.  For any class
this yeilds a great earring, for druids, run it a second time for
another great earring.  This requires nine items and uses all
the trade skills, although the items aren't no drop, so you can
specialize in one and trade them around.  Still, it helps drive
the demand for trade skill raising items up.  But it also requires
spider silk, I think 9 per attempt, and most people fail
it a lot.  Since the rest of the components for a robe are vendor
buyable, about 10pp worth per fail plus 150pp worth per success,
you are looking at 9 spider silks potentially turning into a robe that
sells for 3kpp.  Pay 10pp each for the silks, succede once every
ten tries, and you still paid 900 plus 160, or a bit over 1kpp for
an item that sells for 3kpp... and you got 10 potential skill ups
in tailoring, at probably the lowest cash outlay per that is reachable
in high end tailoring.

HQ bear pelts, on the other hand, make ONE item, the tailored
backpack, which used to be in demand as a bank stretcher, but
subsequent introduction of LOTS of cheap 10 slot bags has shot
that market all to hell.  You can't get your skill very high with them,
they make a now pratically useless item... question isn't why are they
selling for so low, but why still so HIGH?  Answer, I think, is nostalgia.
We all remember the joy of looting one of those things, 40pp, an
unimaginable fortune to a non-twinked sub 10th level!
