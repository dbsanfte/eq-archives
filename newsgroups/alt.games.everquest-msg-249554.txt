Lets also not forget that a Beastlord is some DAMN Nice DPS for an LDoN /
Grind group :)

IMHO  42-49 are a bst's "hell levels" ( Such as they are ), as your 39 pet
is really starting to become a lot weaker compared to what your fighting.
Anyhting you can do to get through those levels as painlessly as possible
will be quite welcome. LDoN are good for that.

49 though is a whole new ball game. 49-51 ( at least 51... thats as high as
Ive gotten so far ) are AMAZINGLY fast by comparison. The 49 pet is a
monster upgrade.
