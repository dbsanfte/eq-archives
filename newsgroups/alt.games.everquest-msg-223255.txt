The enchanter epic is the hardest in that none of it (except a few really
easy parts) are MQable.  Mage is even easier since the hardest piece CAN be
bought. :p

My advice for your enchanter friend (from someone who has the enchanter
epic):  Do NOTHING until you get Shissar in Fear, then do VERY LITTLE until
you get that stupid Hate part.  After that you can get the epic within a
week if you're in a 55+ guild (but more likely a couple months for most
people...which is but a blink of an eye).
