BINGO!  That's what I look to do each time I'm able to play.  Maximize
efficiency.  For no other purpose than tthis:

My buddies and I don't have a ton of time to spend online in a given week,
so when we get the chance to play together (a rarity due to schedules) we
don't want to spend a bunch of time performing tedious chores like travel.

Best way I've heard it described yet.
