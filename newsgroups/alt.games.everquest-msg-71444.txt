/cheer soulsowers

About time these came into the game. Everyone sick of /ooc for a sow and
having to bribe a sower.

e.g. My lvl 7 monk twink went from Qeynos to fight in the commons. Went to
Freeport bank and sent tell to a lvl 28 Druid sitting there asking if
they would mind sowing me please for a donation.

,.... no reply

/ooc Paying 30pp for sow at bank. Lo and behold suddenly mr druid wants
to sow me, took the sow from someone else though

This will make the game better for non self sowing classes. They can now
travel to different places and sow as they go along in the nearest
available town. /cheer verant


/cheer soulporters

About time these came into the game. Everyone sick of /ooc for a port and
having to bribe a porter.

e.g. My lvl 7 monk twink went from Qeynos to fight in the commons. Went to
Freeport bank and sent tell to a lvl 49 Wizard sitting there asking if
they would mind porting me please for a donation.

,.... no reply

/ooc Paying 30pp for port at bank. Lo and behold suddenly mr wizard wants
to port me, took the port from someone else though

This will make the game better for non self porting classes. They can now
travel to different places and port as they go along in the nearest
available town. /cheer verant

(Sorry, couldn't resist)
