With the changes in The Hole I have been reading about I am wondering how that
affects the shaman epic mob.  Has anyone gotten their shaman epic piece since
the update or been involved with a group that has?  I am still kinda new to the
game and I haven't been to alot of the zones, so I don't really know what the
"old" Hole was like, but I don't think I like what I am reading about the "new"
updates.

Thanks for any information.
