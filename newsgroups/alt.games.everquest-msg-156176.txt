ok lets give you a couple of real examples here:
Gnollslayer sword (deluxe lighted whack a gnoll version)
quest part 1: Go kill this level 18 or so SK gnoll in Blackburrow, and
recover Baby Sayer.
Low level person loots the (nodrop) baby and goes and get gets the (nodrop)
Gnoll Slayer Mk I (worse than a fine steel sword but with bane 5 vs. gnolls)
quest part 2:
High level guildmate goes into infected paw (a 25+ dungeon) and goes near
the back, and kills the two quest mobs back there, which drop an eye and
something else (sorry I forget). You would have to have at least one group
of 35s to pull this off at that level, and you'd have to work together very
good.
Go back to Mr. Sayer, get both high level guildmate and low level person
there.
High level guildmate hands in his two quest items, Mr. Sayer says something
about needing everything he asked for to finish the quest.
Lowbie hands in the Gnoll Slayer Mk I. Now Mr. Sayer has recieved everything
he needs to trigger the quest reward, and assuming the low level person has
good enough faction, hands the last person to hand something in the Gnoll
Slayer Mk II, a decent damage/delay longsword with gnoll bane 10, GLS light
source, and 2 charges of the lowest level shaman pet (very nice for a level
20 warrior).

Example II
Wizard Bob KS's Enchanter Phil using his manaburn to kill the AC in Southern
Ro, and loots the (nodrop) Ancient Ring. He then goes and kills shadowed men
till he gets the (nodrop) rapier. One of his guildmates checks that Hasten
is up in Rathe Mountains. He ports up to the bazaar and auctions MQ Jboots
5k firm. He gets a taker, who picks up the gold to give Hasten (part of the
quest) and they port down and run to the Rathe. Bob's guildmate (tracker)
goes and finds Hasten and 'chain hails' him so he'll stand still, while they
lumber over to where he is.  Wizard hands in the rapier and AC ring,
followed by the gold from the intended recipient, who ends up with the
(nodrop) Jboots.
(note: I know 4 people who will give Hasten the required amount of gold just
to screw these people up... some people have toooo much money).

Basically it's a method for circumventing the 'you must do all the parts of
the quest' nodrop tags that Verant puts on things. If Verant really really
wants to make you do it they make the quest require everything be combined
in a container. (example, the Enchanter epic has one little bit at the
begining that can be multiquested, but the rest of the quest requires the
enchanter gather all the parts (except for 1 purchasable piece) because they
must be combined in bags before turning them in.
