Wrong. I've seen them roam twice without being pulled; and the character I was
using has a Harvester, so don't try to tell me they were being pulled by
someone invisible.

Agreed. I got killed once because of this; fortunately everyone knew who was
responsible for this, and he was denied healing, rezzing, buffs, etc. by
everyone for the rest of the day.

Happens way too often from what I've seen, unfortunately. A member of my guild
was killed by Specs twice in one night because a Bard didn't warn people when
he lost control of his pulls.

Amen. I ripped into the Bard for being careless, and he blew it off.

I live for the day when I can make the Bard in question train-fodder for his
foolish actions.
