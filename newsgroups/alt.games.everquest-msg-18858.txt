Give him a proper surname - ala Jones, or Smith. A family surname that
is - rather than those thrice-damned 'title-names' you get in lame TSR
novels, or bad CRPG's. "Hi, my name is Trubeard Elvenfire! What, why
are you laughing?"

Hmm, suggestions you say? Kronk, possibly. Kogginn Kronk has a certain
... texture to it, if you will. A certain appeal. Something guttural I
would imagine - Dwarf-ese is usually pictured as a guttural rough
language. Perhaps a stroll around Kaladim would give you some ideas
for how Dwarves do surnames - extrapolate from there?

Perhaps go the old -son route. Kogginn Smithson, Kogginn Brakson -
something along those lines. Or perhaps the Dwarves are like Scots or
the Irish - and place an appelation at the front - MacBron, or
McAllister possibly - albeit with the proper dwarf appelation, rather
than Scots/Irish - unless you want to come off as Scots/irish of
course.

Just stay away from those damned 'Metalbeater', 'Goodhealer',
'Blooddrinker' names... I cringe every time I see them. Personally, Id
rather be known as Sutter Cain, than Sutter FastFists.
