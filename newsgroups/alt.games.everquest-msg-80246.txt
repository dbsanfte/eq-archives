The 10 most common zones for a warrior, in decreasing order of
population, on Seventh Hammer are:

  lvl 51-55: dreadlands, ecommons, nexus, karnor, velketor, commons,
    maiden, shadowhaven, dawnshroud, bazaar

  lvl 46-50: dreadlands, ecommons, karnor, soldungb, commons,
    thurgadina, greatdivide, lavastorm, akheva, beholder

Unfortunately, my numbers are raw and unedited, so you're not seeing
that many of the high-level folk in dreadlands are just passing
through. Also true for commons, ecommons and nexus. Karnor,
Velketor's, Maiden's seem to be good answers.
