I've heard of level 29 pallies running around with their epics.  Clerics can
have their epics at level 1, but can't right-click rez until level 50.  The
Magician epic is a level 46 spell, which obviously does a level 1 no good.

Most epics have been outdated by other spells / weapons anyway.  Right now
my level 44 paladin is running around with not one but two weapons that have
better DPS than the pally epic.  So while it might be the ultimate twink
statement to be running around with your epic, in most cases the effort is
not worth the reward.  About the only exception is the cleric epic, which is
still an essential item for any high-end cleric.
