Pretty good point.  I got fed up with EQ when my lvl 70 Beastlord
couldn't even solo a light blue/green in the latest zones.  My pal's
Druid who had several thousand AA points (I just don't have his dogged
determination) and excellent gear as often as not had to flee a zone
as he couldn't do likewise.

If the player numbers had been there to group with, that would have
been fine, but the most you saw/heard in EQ zones was tumbleweed and
crickets.  I just got sick of having to try and solo.

After that, ANYTHING seems easier.
