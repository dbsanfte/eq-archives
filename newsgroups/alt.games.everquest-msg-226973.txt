Not just that.  Many people have admitted that they only play EQ because
of their friends in the game (unless they are all just lying and don't
want to admit they are addicted, that is  possible).  Grouping is where
most people make those friends.  Thus I'd imagine SOE equates grouping to
how you keep folks from leaving.  But I'd say what Dennis pointed out is a
big deal too.
