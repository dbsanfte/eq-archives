Sorry, bullshit.

Mightystrike is fun, but it is in no way significant.  It'll perhaps double
your damage output for 10 seconds, which will likely add up to a couple
hundred points of damage.  Considering the fact that the mobs you are fighting
will have several thousand hp, thats not all that much.  And noticing the 55
rogue standing behind it double backstabbing for 400 each puts it even more in
perspective.

And in a VS fight, it's about the least useful thing you can do.   For some
strategies, Furious is used to block his hits and do riposte damage, but often
the most important discipline is once again Defensive.   The main tank has to
live long enough to be runed again and CH'ed.   If the main tank dies because
he was trying to squeeze out a bit of extra damage (amounting to about 1 - 2%
of VS's total life), then aggro will fly everywhere, hits and lifetaps will
start landing, and it will most likely end up causing a wipeout.

That being said, I don't see anything wrong with using mightystrike, even
waiting to bezerk for it, in controlled fights to have a bit of fun.  That is
what the game is about, after all.  But always be aware of the possibilites.
If you think you might need defensive within the next hour for any reason,
it's not worth it. Thats a long time to work without a net, sometimes.   It's
an experience camp toy, not a useful or class defining ability.
