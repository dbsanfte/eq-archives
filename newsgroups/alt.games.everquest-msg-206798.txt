All sorts of misconceptions regarding shaman vs enchanter slow.

To set the record straight, ignoring the fact that shaman do get a 
disease line of slows for those that are too magic resistant.

Levels 5 to 11, only a shaman can slow, 11% to 12%.

Levels 12 to 38, enchanters slow better than shaman, anywhere from 5% 
better  to getting the same slow effect one level earlier than the 
shaman.

Level 39+ is where the shaman regains his advantage, and never loses it 
again, anywhere from 10% at level 39, up to 12% at level 43, then sits at 
a 5% difference from level 44 on up to level 65.

To add to the mix, at level 65, Beastlords get a 65% slow, all of another 
5% slower than the best enchanter slow, making it 10% less than the best 
shaman slow.  BLs get a 15% to 22% between levels 20 and 49, then at 
level 50, they get a 50% slow, which puts them 5% behind enchanters, 10% 
behind shaman.  The BL 50% slow does not get better with level, so at 
level 64, a BL slow is 25% lower than shaman, 20% lower than enchanter.

The other advantage the shaman has is an AoE 49% slow at level 58 that 
increases to 50% at level 60.

I'm sure if I missed something here someone will be more than happy to 
point it out to me.
