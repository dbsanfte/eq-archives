You're assuming a master database for all of EQ.  I'd doubt that's
the case, myself.   Rather than a huge database having all toons
and items in it, it's a lot more technically feasible to implement
a database for each server.   When you select the server, it simply
passes in your account identifier to enable that database to pull
up characters on that server.

The implementation itself speaks for that from both the interface
(a screen to select servers followed by a screen to select toons)
and hardware (master server with associated zone servers)
perspectives.  I could be wrong, but I don't see anything in what
I do know of their implementation to suggest it.  And I certainly
do see a number of reasons to implement it in a distributed
manner.

Furthermore, I believe Bertoxx had a database problem which
caused all characters there to have a roll-back of data recently.
That's pretty difficult to explain in a one-database scenario.

That ignores the point, of course.  You can't magically "nuke the account
which deletes the characters" without deleting the characters.

Sure.  And yet the obvious question remains.  Your argument is that
they get rid of the account which gets rid of the characters.   So how
does that eliminate the (trivial) task of deleting the characters?  It
doesn't.  It implies a "for each character associated with this account,
delete" logic.   Of course, if you have some way of deleting master
records w/o deleting *obviously 'owned' secondary records* while
retaining database integrity, I'd love to hear it.

Total number of records being totally unrelated to size, of course.
But you can add "taxed for storage or by retreival issues generated
by the number of records" if you want.

Re-read the paragraph and note the quotation marks around the
word 'lazy' this time.
