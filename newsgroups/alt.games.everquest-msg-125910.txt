I know it involves a lot of tradeskill work to creat the spell, however you
go get a nice earring with Flowing Thought I with the spell when
finished....but they did say you could buy it once the first person figured
it out, but I think it's alot of work to make all those gifts...Then again I
haven't read too much up on it :)
