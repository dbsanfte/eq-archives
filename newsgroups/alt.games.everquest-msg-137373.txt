 Well I regular solo but I don't really have enough room for the amount
of bandages I'd need. If I had one of those banadage summoning items,
then maybe. But, since I don't, I live with Invigorate healing.

 I'm sure I'd like it if I had it trained, but that's a whole lot of
points that I can spend elsewhere. I'm sure I'll get it eventually and
will like it. It's just not a priority at the moment.

 Not a wide variety of useful things to train in class. How about
improved safefall or whatever? Yeah, I'm going to spend points on that!
The only (only!) way I'd train that is if it made me immune from 10k
falls.

 Normally I can get their dot in the first slot, so dispell works.
However, in rare occassions everyone is already dead and I just watch my
HP get to 0 and I die. Which isn't fun. I'd probably only use it a few
times a month maybe, so it's also not a high priority. But at 9 points
it's not really that expensive.
