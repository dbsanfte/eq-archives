You clipped out her quote showing how she isn't concerned about being unfair
about reimbursing others. Here you go:

****Okie doke, from here on out, dots get sold right along with the rest of
the loot and everyone gets an equal share... No special consideration given
for dots at all since they really don't drop all that often as it is and
would be unfair to give one to Cleric and not to Chanter or Necro if they
are in group as well...****

A reasonable person would have wanted to compensate the other classes that
used reagents as well. However the information that she was going on was
somewhat flawed so I added some more information about the reagents used by
the other classes she mentioned. Her knee jerk reaction was to not
compensate anyone, leaving more to split for herself.

I've been posting in this newsgroup since the beta, where did you come from?
