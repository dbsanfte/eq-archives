I have a chart printed out here from a post someone made back in July of 
this year, with most of the zones in the game and their ZEMs.

Oddly, though, its missing a few zones, in particular, its missing All 
the old planes

Sky (once known as Air), Hate, Fear, Growth and Mischief, all missing.

I recently did a Hate raid, and the new hate looks like it could be an 
exp group zone, blue mobs that didn't seem difficult to kill or to 
single pull, the zone in itself is a safe spot.  Having to have a hate 
stone and a wizard to get there would be a nuisance, though, and the 
fact that most of the mobs were under 55 doesn't actually speak well for 
it as an exp zone... but I was curious.

I know many people have spoken about doing single group fear, again, I'd 
think the mobs a bit low for real exp there, but they were easy enough 
to kill from what I recall back in the day.

Growth, other than the annoyance of sudden massive faction hits and then 
something I heard recently about them restoring aggro on the POGs, looks 
like a great way for a group to gear up in velious junk; comperable 
class drops to thurg/SS quest armor, but better drop rates and no need 
to mess around getting faction and gems; kill mob, loot armor, done.

Air, I'd fear to tread without at least a small raid, and the quest 
stuff from there seems tedious to accumulate, I don't recall mob levels 
at all.

However, that leaves one zone.  Mischief.  I'd never set foot in there 
back in the day with any of my other characters, a trip thru NTOV 
requiring raid level forces to get somewhere without raid level targets 
never seemed to be in the cards.

However, while playing my mage up thru the levels, they moved the POM 
entrance to GD, an easy jog from POK.  I stuck my nose in a couple times 
once I hit 46 (heck, I tried before that, and ended up ported across the 
zone to the succor spot, too low to go in), safe spot where you zone in, 
KOS mobs around that.

A few days ago, though, I found a bard LFG and convinced him to go give 
it a shot.  Yard trash mobs turned out to be single pullable, non 
summoning, levels 54 or 55 for the most part, and not too hard to kill. 
Soon we had a necro, 4 mages, and a bard whomping around the yard 
killing everything we could find, I did 4 yellow in well under 4 hours.

Since then, I've gotten the Winterfury team hooked on the place, its 
easy to get to, filled with easy to pull and kill mobs, nice exp and 
fairly effortless compared to what we'd been doing otherwise.

We're getting ready to go inside the castle, or at least up on the 
walls, where the mobs are 55 to 57 instead of 54 to 55; the exp bonus 
should be much heftier this way.

At any rate, I was wondering how the exp per kill will compare to 
similar level mobs in POP.  The Ease of killing certainly seems to be 
higher, so the exp per hour may well come out ahead even if the ZEM is 
much lower.
