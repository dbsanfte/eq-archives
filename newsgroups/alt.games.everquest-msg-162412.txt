Erm... what do you mean if the price changes?  The price *doesn't*
change.  It still says '19pp'.  It means per, but I don't remember
seeing any instructions about that myself.  Nowhere in the bazaar or
trader windows will it tell you the total for multiple units until you
have purchased multiple units, when you are told "you hand so and so
much money for stuff you don't feel like getting yourself".
Personally, I just went and found someone selling something cheap that
I would use and bought two to see how it worked when I started a
trader.
