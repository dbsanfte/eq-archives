Yes, that was a faction merchant (City Guard, Temple of Life, etc) and
you need a rating with them before you can buy anything - you get a
bettwe rating with them by doing writs.

There are also City Merchants scattered about (I use the one near
Qeynos Harbour docks) that have a large selection regardless of any
faction ratings.

Note - you need Status Points, as well as cash, to buy things from
them, and afaik, SPs can only be earned when you're ina Guild and do
writs for various faction (as well as certain quests).

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
