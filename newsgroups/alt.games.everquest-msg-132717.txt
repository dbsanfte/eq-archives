All mobs, even KoS mobs, take a moment to notice you.   The amount of time is
dependent on your faction level (at least at one specific point, maybe others)
and on your current character level.  There are two blue guards in Echo
caverns that are very KoS to me right now.   I can run past them without invis
on, but it doesn't work every time.  And if I hesitate, even a moment, within
thier aggro rage, they are both certain to come after me.

Mobs don't constantly check thier faction to you / distance to you to
determine whether they should begin attacking or not.   To save some CPU
cycles, they only check it at various intervals... or when an event happens
near them (like you attack the mob next to them.)

Is it possible that using /con would force a check of the faction level at the
current time, and set off the aggro routine?   Yeah, it might be.  But would
it have not attacked if you hadn't conned it?  More than likely.  Especially
if you paused within range of it instead of continuing running.  I've never
used /con to set off aggro when aggro pulling.   Even if it has an effect,
it's not necessary.   Just pause for a second and it'll happen on its own.
