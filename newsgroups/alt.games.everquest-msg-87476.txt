Way we run it in our guild is hold the spot for the person that went LD for
at least 30 min or so.  Gives most people enough time to reboot their CPU
(if need be), and reconnect to EQ then return to group.  If someone wants to
group while the person is AFK due to LD you just tell them they are a fill
until the other returns.  Most people understand this.
