I am in the UK. Played for 3 hours early this morning (between 1am and 3am)
, seen ping as low as 45, never fell below 100, still got lag and fair
amount of packet loss, but wouldn't expect otherwise. As for zone
overcrowding, there was more people in Everfrost than I have seen on US
servers. In saying that at such an ungodly hour I can't believe the players
were in the majority, not UK based, just US and Far east players checking
out a new server.

The funniest thing was that it was impossible to get lost in a zone that is
IMHO difficult to get around, all you had to do was follow the trail of
bodies <g>
