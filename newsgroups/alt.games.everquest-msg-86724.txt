Just as a side note, dragging a corpse should be easy if you do it this way:

Make a hot key to do

/corpse

Put the hot key in slot 1 of one of your hot key banks.

Click on the corpse and take off at a run towards your destination.   All the while
chitting the 1 button rapidly.  You can even run at SoW speed dragging a corpse
this way, invised.   I haven't tried dragging while levitated,  but I bet that would work too.
