Thank you jaZZ.  The reason I chose amazon.com is that it is a
generally well-known site that is concerned with selling you
information.  I figured that even a complete and utter moron would
understand that if we're defining obscurity you have to have some way
to measure it.  I'm looking for something close to an objective
measurement here, and seeing as how I don't have access to the entire
Library of Congress at my fingertips, I figured the largest on-line
bookseller would be a close approximation.
Bizbee, you are a fucking loon, you made an asinine statement, and you
just look like an idiot trying to defend it.  You're not the
anti-christ.  Hell, you're not even offensive most of the time, but
sometimes you have your head so far up your ass, you taste the food
twice when you eat it.  
I challenge you to find any reasonably acceptable general purpose site
that pulls up 10% as many hits for Mesmer as Freud.
