Bah, ignore my blank reply to the next message down the thread.  Only on my
first cup of coffee this morning.  :)

A) Warrior job is to *take* damage.  They aren't really considered a
damage-dealing class (that's monks, rogues, rangers).  The fact that even
the "mediocre" warrior blows magicians out of the water means that magicians
are *not* damage dealers.  Not.  Not by any stretch of the imagination. 
Nuking as best they can and with a pet up and fully buffed, a well-equipped
shadowknight or paladin is going to outdo a magician.

B) "damage" "over the course" "wizard"  ?!?  Wizards do damage *now*.  "Over
the course" they fall behind most anyone that has a damage output.

Yeah, druids can fill in as a healer.  Magicians can't.  Druids can snare. 
Magicians can't.  Druids can root.  Magicians can't.  Druids can buff. 
Magicians can't.  Druids can damage shield, and whaddya know, so can
magicians.  Druids can evac.  Magicians can't.  Druids can make it easier to
get a replacement member in a group, and whaddya know, so can magicians. 
You have problems getting a group with your druid?  That's cause there's 20
other druids in the zone.  There aren't 20 other 55+ magicians on the whole
server.

Simply put, magicians don't compare well to any class.  Wizards, who do have
a worse over-time damage output, still come with snare, evacs, root, and the
ability to do all their damage *now*.  And when a magician has had to ditch
their pet for whatever reason, that wizard is still operating at the same
level.

In other words, magicians don't have enough utility for it to be even
considered in grinding or raiding (mod rod 2 and the focus items did help
out with this a lot).  And that leaves their damage as their selling point. 
Which, as you can see, is not a very good selling point since there's so
many people you can pick instead and get better damage.
