	Codswallop.

	Poor experience is only one reason why people wouldn't have gone to
underutilized zones.  Other reasons: poor access, difficult CR, mobs with
abilities you don't want to deal with (e.g. any zone with Enchanter mobs),
poor loot, area requires specialized groups (e.g. you NEED a Rogue, you NEED a
Cleric, you NEED an evaccer, etc.), etc.

	If people don't go someplace, it means the area is broken, not that the
players are wrong.  Prior attempts by the designers to entice people into
underutilized areas by raising experience have all failed dismally.  Velk's
had to have its experience modifier raised TWICE, its mobs retuned, its loot
redone at least once and given an item needed in bulk for a major quest before
people started going there.  That's why this time they didn't just raise the
experience in the underutilized zones, they lowered the experience in the
zones people liked.  This amounts to telling the customers that they are wrong
about what they want from the game, which is an excellent strategy for
reducing profits.
