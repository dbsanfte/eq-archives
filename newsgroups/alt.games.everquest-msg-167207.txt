I don't hate PvP.  I hate grief players.

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure that the vast majority of players on the PvP
servers are fine and honorable people.  But it only takes one.

I just prefer being able to play the game without having to worry about
someone taking out their insecurities on me.

I will admit that I've been tempted to try out a PvP server, just because
there are some people I've wanted to smack upside the head a few times, but
I've made a significant investment on Povar, so I'm probably there to stay.
