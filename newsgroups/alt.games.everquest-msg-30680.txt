Why not druids though?  I fought a blue griff last night in EK (my first yay
hehe) at full mana and really just root/rot'd it until I used maybe 3 cl's
to finish it off - leaving me oom.  Am I doing something wrong here at 19 I
wonder?  It resisted a whole boat load of roots and I think I worked it long
enough to have to use 2 snares or maybe 3 during the fight.

Now I understand what people say about blues though.  I've noticed that now,
these things in EK that con blue to me, *most* of the crag spiders and the
dark thingys and the gorge hounds - will rip huge chunks out of me if they
get a chance to land one on me.  Second thought forget the crag spiders,
I've had to zone both times I've attempted them now after eventually ending
up in a losing kite battle trying to keep just far enough away to get just
enough mana to get another swarm or whatever off.

On topic with the thread, on the night of my discovery of EK, I spent some
time waiting for my buddy to connect at High Pass from Ro.  I dropped into a
pickup group there and made just over a bubble of experience (at 19)
fighting orcs in a very fun group - run by a little warrior (Daniek(sp) on
Brell) who decided after a bit he was bored and was heading off to Runnyeye.
I felt sorry for the folks that lingered.  Either everyone of them in the
ensuing minutes either zoned out near dead or came back to HP shortly
thereafter, in their birthday suits.

I like to play on my own terms but after watching that almost liquid flow of
exp from that group....
