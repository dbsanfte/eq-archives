Hehe I will never forget the clerics reaction on the first big pull.  It
turned out he had never been to Sebilis before, and had never done an AE
group before (he was level 57 at least)... I think he turned a shade of
white in r/l

20 is about average on an AE pull, most i've personally had on a disco ae
group is 32 mobs..  your probablly thinking its lots of downtime, but it
isnt :)   looking at the next fight in my log, it was 5 mins downtime

[Tue Feb 12 19:14:34 2002] You tell your party, 'wee lol'
******
[Tue Feb 12 19:21:22 2002] Logging to 'eqlog.txt' is now *ON*.
[Tue Feb 12 19:21:22 2002] Dunatis tells the group, 'nuke'
[Tue Feb 12 19:21:23 2002] Froglok dar knight is stunned by scintillating
colors.

Now I need to find my 59 pb ae (very rare) or hurry and level to 60 for the
60 pb, then those hits will be for 1k+ each :)

The server is Prexus, tho I am a brit, and debating porting one of my chars
across, or starting a new char on AB.. I raid every single day, and it would
be great to raid at a decent time for once, I couldn't bear to port my wiz
and lose his epic though, or all my monks nodrop stuff
