I don't see a current thread on the topic, nor have I seen one
in quite some time.  New players all the time, new people on
the web site all the time, old hands may have new viewpoints...
and heck, the guild I'm in recently changed policies, I'm irritated
and here's a good place to vent.

"this is liberty hall, you can spit on the floor and call the cat a
bastard"

Unfortunately America isn't exactly liberty hall anymore in that
sense, but how about the internet?

I can't see how its anything but fair.  Then again, I don't believe
in luck or bad luck.  Everyone present has an equal shot at
any item that dropped.  Heck, they were part of the machine
that killed the (whatever it was) that dropped it weren't they?

Now other systems can -also- be fair, and whatever inherant
unfairness for-the-short-run they have may be offset by -for-
the-long-run fairness... but I find they all tend to be biased in
one direction or another.

Oddly, no.  Most high end guilds on Morell Thule use some form of
points system.  If anyone can point me to a random loots guild,
or one that uses some other form of distribution, I'll be happy to
look into them.  Part of why I joined the guild I'm currently in was
its lack of a points system, and heck, part of why I left the one I
was in was a growing disgust with the flaws of the system they
were using.  On the other hand, there are lots of other things that
are important about a guild, and I'd be a fool to join a guild that
I disliked otherwise simply for its loot system, or to leave one
I otherwise like for -its- loot system.

While "love it or leave it" sounds good on a bumper sticker,
in reality "love some things about it, put up with others, try
to change the rest, or leave it" would be a much more rational
approach

If 99 people think something is right, that doesn't make them right
and the one person who thinks otherwise wrong.  And if you see
a group operating with a set of rules, that doesn't mean everyone
in the group agrees with those rules... it merely means that, like
me, those who disagree with some of the rules have nevertheless
decided for one reason or another to stick with the group.

Its possible, in fact, that a majority disagree with some section of
the rules and would like to change them... in fact thats what has
recently occured with the guild I'm in.  They -had- a random
loot system, and have -changed- it to a points system.  Not
everyone liked the old system, but they stayed.  Not everyone
likes the new system, but a lot of those who don't will still
probably stay.

Welcome to realpolitik

At the Top End you don't see many defections, particularly when
there are no real alternatives; its not as though you can become
more powerful by jumping ship, as you see happening constantly
in all the lower level guilds; this is the nature of the Top End... or
so I'd surmise, having never been in that rarified level, as a lowbie
59 cleric
