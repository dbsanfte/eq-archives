I would say the easiest skill to take off from the beginning and at low
levels is either fishing or tailoring.  Fishing can return a 500-800%
prophit even 1st level.  It has no large scale modes of prophit and all
monies gained will be about 5-7 gp per stack of fish.

Tailoring on the other hand can be done with mob loot.  Everfrost is perfect
for this as spiderlings drop silk which can be made into silk
strings.....these can be combined x2 for bandages or x3 for cords.  LQ bear
skins and 1 cord can make a tailored bag which sells for an easy 5pp.
