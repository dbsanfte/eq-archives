Ha! Thank you for possibly inadvertently leading me to insight on a 
problem I've been having.  To quote from the page you liked to:

Finally, a WARNING to Nvidia users.  Avoid the newest 52.16 drivers like
the plague!  A friend of mine hosted a Gaming Lan-Fest this weekend and
almost everyone there with an Nvidia type card was having problems running
most of the games we planned on playing, not to mention one of my users
couldn't run EQ Zone Viewer!  We found version ***45.23*** to be the most
compatible driver to date without losing any of the key features.

I do believe I just upgraded to those drivers, and I've been crashing 6 
ways to sunday.  I'll have to check when I get home. :)
