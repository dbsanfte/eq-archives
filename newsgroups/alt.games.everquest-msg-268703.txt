I've soloed both a priest and a scout in EQ2 at the tiddly-newbie-levels and
its perfectly possible with both, although obviously much easier with the
priest who can effectively double or triple his hit points in a fight. 

I'm a very pro-immersiveness player; I hated the POK books eventually, and
when Luclin first came out did /feedback thanking them for not immediately
putting druid rings everywhere - the feeling of running long distances and
*exploring* reexcited me about EQ.

EQ2 feels... hm. A little more arcadey than EQ1, certainly easier, but not
really less immersive. Its different, but the 'locked combat' hasnt spoilt
the illusion for me yet - you can still get in all sorts of trouble on
your own (I died 6 times trying to solo a red con named , getting tantalisingly
close to winning each time on my scout ;) ), and it only really cuts out
the annoyance of other peoples inepetitude infringing on your play time.

I dont like the inability to drop items, or the continuing reliance on
placeholder mobs for quests (Newbie shark quest requires killing lots
of trigger fish to make the sharks spawn - a game mechanic requirement
that should be 'masked' from the end player frankly. The first time I
tried it I swam around looking for sharks, and it took forever. The second
time I killed all the lil trigger fish and lo, hundreds of sharks.  I was
hoping that by EQ2 they would say 'if player on quest y in area x then
spawn mob z at rate of q a minute' type affair).

But... overall.... Im liking EQ2. Its very polished, and seems less
grief prone and dude ridden than EQ1... but I've just gone from the
top end of EQ1, a few mobs from Anguish, to newbie land again, and that
refreshing change may be a large part of it too.
