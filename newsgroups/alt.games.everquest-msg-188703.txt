A Corrupted Knight with Rune of Death on it does 700+DPS.  Your group
doesnt.

Not a different issue at all.  The issue is that the charms are
overpowered, whether or not they are used by a solo enchanter or one in
a group or one with a partner.  You mentioned some problems people
charming encounter, and I offered the most common solutions.

Why are you even arguing when its obvious you dont know wtf you are
talking about?  No one charming for fast xp resses their corpses right
away.  Usually they will wait until the timer is getting low on the
oldest before getting one, or wait until they are done xping.  Some
players dont even bother getting a res period, the xp is that good.

You are wrong.  Again.  There is not a lot of 'risk' doing anything in a
PoP zone.  A 56 plus res is usually minutes away and your body goes to
the fucking ZI in like 30 mins tops.  Since PoP went live I have seen
Druids soloing in plenty of zones.  I have seen some train, sure.  But
so what?  It happens and soloing players, or druids, by no means have a
monopoly on
trains.

Neither are forgone conclusions.

The PoP roots stick well enough to make good xp in Storms Valor and HoH.
They stick even better on most things in Tier 1 zones.

I play a Necro.  So I have plenty of experience root cooking, soloing
and aggro kiting.  The only conclusion I can draw from our observations
is that you know shitty druids and I know good ones.

Wrong!  Even if you have a great group that is all business and no BS,
you will have a tough time finding a spot that can support the kind of
constant short range pulls needed to make xp as fast as a soloist can
with a small camp of static spawns.  Using the example I provided above,
in HoH I can keep a 6 spawn on a 20 min timer clear.  This gives me an
AA an hour.  Now, your full group would need what, at least 30 kills in
the same time frame to match my xp.  Thirty kills in 20 mins.  That cant
be done in any place that I know of.

> Oh, and interesting contradiction in your post:

> > and you dont need an uber rare charm spell to do it

You took that out of context.  Charms are still overpowered.  Is all I
was saying with the line above was that you dont even need charm to make
xp twice as fast as a full group.  But with charm you can double that
already high xp
rate.

You do need charm to kill things like the Diaku Overseer or Paffa with 3
people.
