L3 and 4 are the hardest levels you'll see until L30. Kinda weird. :-)

That assumes you're still soloing as a L3 or 4 newbie. Some classes
are better than others at this level (especially the pet classes). A
lot of people are still stuck with fighting L1 and 2 monsters rather
than evens and it takes a surprisingly large number of L1 and 2
monsters to level a L3 and 4.

After that you move to better monsters, and the leveling speed shoots
up again. But L3 and 4 can be really irritating.
