Oh. I guess I just don't understand how pulling Statue differs from
just aggro'ing and turning tail and running like crazy.

Surely you still can take it better than than the Kleenex classes,
can't you? I'd be interested in seeing how a wizard would do pulling
comparatively speaking.

Of course.

That would just make you too similar to the tank classes once again.

Or maybe he would adapt as you undoubtedly will.

It is still possible for Statue to be pulled, possibly just using
different tacticts, yes? Sounds to me they have just made a mob that
had gotten routine for you a good deal more challenging, thereby more
interesting.

That's good for the game in my book.
