Wow, after quoting all that you snipped something?  I don't even know

I didn't put anything in the bank, good point.  Should have tried that 
just for more data on the experiment.  Only one character per server as 
I understand it, does the shared bank slot not work? If it does, you 
could save 20 items worth of stuff that way.

Aye, your hide skills will be pretty low.  Races that get hide at least 
start at 50%, but thats still not exactly high reliability.  Good to 
know it works as expected though.

You can't move in hide mode, you have to also successfully sneak in 
order to get moving hide.  From your description you may have been doing 
one without the other, more likely in sneak than in hide.  Once you do 
have success with hide, if you stay still and don't attack, it should 
stay on.  Likewise, sneak should stay on, although its nearly useless in 
PVP as it only works when behind someone, and if you are behind them 
they can't see you anyway.  But rogue hide + sneak allows movement while 
totally invisible except to people with see invis on... and thats kind 
of a high level spell for this server, seems to me (a vital one, though)

But if it really does work as you describe, with hide popping on and 
off, then its not at all as nice as I'd thought.

Splendid
