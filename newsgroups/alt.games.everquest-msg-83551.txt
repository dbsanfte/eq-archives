     Spoken as one who has never been celibate 
any extended periods of time.  I am a navy wife.
My husband goes away for six months at a time.
Right now he's stationed in a different state.
We've been apart for about a year, this time
around.  I love him, and will hold no other while
he lives.  So I know of what I speak.
   Celibate people are obsessed with sex.  We
think about it all the time, dream of it, 
and.... I can't even finish this sentence, I'm 
too busy thinking about...  Well, you know.
I see alt.sex.celibacy as a place where all
the poor, down-trodden celibates such as myself
could gather together in a climate of tolerance
and understanding to support, sympathize, and
talk dirty to each other.
