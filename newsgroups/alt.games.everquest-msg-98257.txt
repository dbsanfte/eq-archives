Ok...here is my opinion of all trade that happen.

to Rangers:Pavel Bure

to Panther:Filip Novak
           Igor Ulanov
           1rs rounder

both switch 2nd rounder if panther finish below rangers.

Well this one,even if Novak have a great potencial,rangers screwd the 
phanters.Sure they get 10 millions to cover...but bure will be back as 
the dominant player he was.Ulanov is a choke and the 1rst rounder for 
next year draft is also is..consedeting its going to be one of the 
cheapest draft ever..no talent there(well no potencial 50 goals scorer)


To Colorado:Darius Kasparaitis

to Pisstburgh:Ville Neminen
              Rick Berry


Colorado get a good dmen with experience for a dmen with no expericen but 
that will be better later.Berry is one of the top prospect for colorado 
and i think its a high price to pay for kasparaitis.Nieminen is a throw 
in.


To Montreal:Stephane Fiset

to LA: Future draft pick.

Montreal get an experiecne goalie to give Theo some rest.Good move by 
Savard here.


To Philadelphia:Adams Oates

To Washington:Maxime Ouellet,1rst,2nd,3rd rounder in 2002

WHAT???Adams Oates is good....but giving so much for him is too 
big.Clarke will regret this mvoe later when Ouellet will be a top goalie
(and when the flyers always have problems with their goalie)


To rangers:Tom Poti
           Rem Murray

to edmonton:Mike York

Edmonton win on this deal.They get a top notch offensive player in return 
of a young dmen who simply play like crap recently.They throw in also 
another average prospet who never turn out to be as good as he was 
supposed to be(Murray).It will help rangers a bit this year in 
defence...but they will miss offensive contribution from York


thats it..would like to hear you tough too =)
