Actually, it updates when I root them too, no DD in my root.  It just seems
to require a spell to be cast on the mob to get it to update.  Being as I
don't have a snare, I always sit too far away for the bar to be updated, so
I have just had to learn about how many DoTs it takes to take down a
particular mob.
