A reverse LFG flag would be good, ie a group can advertise they are
looking for a player of type X to kill y.

Another simple way would be to have higher server populations. More
people mean more people around looking for groups. When EQ2 launched I
had no problems finding groups to do major quests now I can hang around
for ever waiting for a group. Not surprising I don't bother to wait
and go off to solo elsewhere.
