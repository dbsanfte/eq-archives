} I just hit lvl 28..and now freeport guards con yellow to me.....how long
}before them dirty bastards con blue? Im looking forward to doing the soulfire
}quest and killing Lucan...

In general, there are three levels between when a mob first cons yellow 
and when it first cons blue.  It will be yellow for two levels, and then 
even for one.

However... Sir Lucan is lvl 48, and only a couple of the guards are lvl 
30... Most are about 35-37.  You still have quite a ways to go...
