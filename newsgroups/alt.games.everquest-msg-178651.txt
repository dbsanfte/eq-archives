I *understand* why you stayed.  I'm guessing alot of people's stories are
similar, and I applaud someone who's really in it to help out their friends.  
What's irritating to me is the guy that's running around "/OOC LFG", joins up
with you in a regular pickup group, and goes silent 10 minutes later.  What's
with that?  We've disbanded a couple of people for that, and *I* always worry
about them, leaving someone standing there all alone.  On the other hand, why
the heck was he LFG anyway if he was tired???? I don't get it....
