Hehe, I think if my hubby were to try EQ, I'd probably sit with him,
not on eq and talk him through things, give him some ideas of some
things you pick up over time, but, I wouldnt want him hanging on to my
shirt tails like a lost puppy only able to be playing when Im there..

Im glad you both play as individuals, I think thats a good thing
