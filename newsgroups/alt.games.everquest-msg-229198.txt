Oh, I dunno...if the shield had insanely sweet saves it might be worth it
(I have no idea whether it does or not).  AFter all, I hear furious bash
is fairly craptastic.  It only works well for knight classes because it
goes off when they cast their own aggro spells, but if they can cast those
spells they don't need furious bash.

Except maybe that particular furious bash shield is one of the ones good
enough to be worthwhile?  I know the one from Auliffe Chaoswind is
considered just a toy for warriors and gets bagged, sooo...if this one is
similar, it wouldn't really help anyone else much more.

Can't say I'd blow my own points on it though, unless it looked really
REALLY cool and there was nothing else I wanted...which is unlikely.
