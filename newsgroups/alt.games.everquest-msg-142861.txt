9 minutes actually, according to spdat.  It could be 10 though, not like I
usually have to refresh it anyways (except Elysians)

Pff, wussy druids that can't take a hit.  The last 5 times I've died soloing
other than LD were, being trained, being trained, accidentally rooting
myself next to an Elysian =o, falling off a cliff, and getting assraped by
my train in the Grey after a wandering golem stunned me with his proc.

The way the spell database works doesn't allow different durations for
separate slots of a single effect.  Hell, the reason the druid epic dot
lasts 3 minutes (which is a lot longer than the oft compared shaman and
necro epics) is because originally the snare effect was seen as a bonus by
VI (prior to 'immune to runspeed changes') and a 1 minute snare was seen as
too short (even though necro snare/dots are like 48 seconds /shrug)

Also, removing the snare component on the druid epic should allow the druid
and necro epics to stack, currently they don't because the necro epic has a
greater snare modifier, and overwrites the druid epic, and due to the
inability of separating slots on different effects, the necro dot overwrites
the druid epic dot also.
