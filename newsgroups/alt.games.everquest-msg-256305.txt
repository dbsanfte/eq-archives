I don't think Streakiness is really the right word for what he seems to 
be complaining about.

Chunkiness would be more like it: if you rely on avoidance to reduce 
your damage per minute, then you see damage coming in big chunks that 
are hard to predict and hard to know how to heal; a few missed avoids in 
a row with all the blows hitting for max and you might be dead before 
that heal lands, or a few extra avoids and you might be wasting most of 
a CHeal.

Contrast this to mitigation, where more blows land but for less damage, 
and you get a smoother damage run; this is much easier to heal because 
its much more predictable.

 From a cleric standpoint, two guys who take the same amount of damage 
per minute, but one via avoidance and one via mitigation, the mitigation 
guy is preferable.

My Berserk suffers from much the same effect; a chain class I tend to 
take high damage per blow, but get chunks where I avoid whole tics of 
damage, and stun lands and I avoid more tics... then suddenly I'll get 
hit by all 4 of a round or two in a row, and my hp bar will jump down quick.

And I apply the same principle to my foes; my big slow axe comes out 
with pulses of single or double hits every few seconds instead of the 
stream of fast double hit double attack light blows that rangers tend to 
spam out, and then I add in Frenzy to this; frequently I can take a mob 
down to just above where it will cast a heal and then get lucky and 
slaughter him before he gets a spell off, while the steady damage output 
of a more traditional melee will get the same distance in the same time, 
overall, but doesn't have the "sprint" that can push from before heal to 
dead without giving him more warning.
