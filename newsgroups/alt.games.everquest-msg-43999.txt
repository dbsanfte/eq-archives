Thinking about a visit to the Hole. (At least just the entry area to
check it out unless we get a lot more people.) Couple of questions:

The key: Is it no drop, or can we just take an alt, give him some money
and have him buy it for us? Getting faction up there could be a time
consuming nightmare. (Yes, I've heard some folks can squeeze in there
without a key, but somehow I don't think my fat troll butt if pulling
that off.)

Access to/from the zone out point: If you only go in as far as the first
hall where the six elementals spawn, or maybe beyond that to the "ledge"
I've been reading about, can you turn around when you're done and
walk/swim back out to the zone line? Or is it one of those freaking
one-way entrances and you have to port out?

Entry spawns: Allegedly there's a number (six or eight?) spots where
elementals spawn shortly after you come out of the water. Maps make them
look fairly close together. Can they be single pulled? Or is this a "no
enchanter, no pulling" sort of area?
TIA
