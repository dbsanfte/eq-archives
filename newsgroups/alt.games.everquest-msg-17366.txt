Did they convert?  When you go and preach to them do they "see the light"
and leave behind their heretical ways?  No?  Send in the Paladins.  It is
time to "cleanse" them because the Fairies are unredeemable, and it is
better to be rid of them before they corrupt others.

That is the fanatical way, and "gods warriors" are intended to be fanatics.
