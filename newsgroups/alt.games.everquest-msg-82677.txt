Yuck.. I've never heard of that. The 1.5 to 3 meg a second (you sure
thats not 3,000,000 mega BITS though.. that would be 300,000 bytes..
which is what I average for download on a cable modem) is nice but
having ot upload through a regular modem is criminal.. also what is
the point? If they are downloading to you I can't see how its that
much of a stretch for them to upload from you. I thought I had it bad
getting up to 400,000 bytes per second while only uploading at up to
30,000 or so.

Its very important to find out what that 3 meg is a second. There are
Kbs and kbs which they often reference. One is bits and one is bytes.
I thought DSL in my area was a good deal at 500,000 Kbs download (or
whichever one is bits) until a friend explained to me that would only
be 50,000 bytes which really would suck ass after having cable modem
at 400,000 bytes. Besides that the dsl was very expense.

Whichever, your set up would not really be horrible for EQ.. much
better than just a regular modem anyway. You'd be getting the packets
sent to you fast which is the important part and far less info is sent
from you to them anyway. Its pretty much like the disparity in regular
net surfing, for example I open up zone alarm and for the little I
used the computer today after rebooting I sent 179,000 bytes while I
downloaded 3.61 mbytes.
