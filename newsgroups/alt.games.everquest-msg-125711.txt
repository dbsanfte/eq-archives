I hated LOIO when I went there with my ranger, lots of deaths, idiocy on
shout and ooc.  When Luclin came out, Paludal was my fave zone for leveling
up from mid teens to mid 20s.  Just went back there with my druid...it's
getting as bad as LOIO...same idiots shouting idiotic things at each other.
Good xp there tho, just wish people would just keep the group going and get
the xp so I can get to 24 and not need them as much.

Oh well, gonna try again tomorrow I guess....when do the children go back to
school?  /sigh, it couldn't be next week could it?
