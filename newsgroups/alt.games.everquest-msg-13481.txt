    *chuckle* How does the game engine handle FD, though? Does it treat it
differently from an actual death? Can you imagine the horror if your
so-called "fix" meant that if a puller died while pulling, all the mobs he
was on the hate list of would become immune to FD? And to make something
recognize that a specific player has Feigned near them - well, if mobs can't
remember who's done a quest with them, I hold faint hope for a FD solution.

    Nothing important can be done client side. Nothing. If it's meaningful,
it will be hacked.

    They don't want people under the bridge. So don't put anyone under the
bridge. I got that from reading what's been presented so far. UNDER THE
BRIDGE IS BAD.

    And VI doesn't like it, either. They've said that, but they cannot think
of a way to stop people  from trying to flee danger, nor do they think
people shouldn't try and get away. They HAVE given warnings to people who
have done things like zone-kiting, however.

    Off topic - one of our guild shammies reported that a zone-kited mob
doesn't lose health anymore - zone back and he's at full health. Has anyone
else noticed this? It sounds like DoTs that become unattributed drop off the
mob - which would be the logical solution to the poofing corpse problem they
supposedly solved a while back.

    If you don't know, then ask a GM. Yes, it CAN be done.

    I can guess at why. If I the player control an NPC (pet/charm), I can
whack away at an NPC that stays in water normally (fish-type NPCs) and never
worry about being hit. If I get my positioning right, and have a
spellcasting NPC (charmed Deepwater Goblin in Oasis, say), then my NPC may
never be exposed to danger, either. I don't agree with VI's direction here -
I'd rather see fish fly out of water than have to deal with the exploits
that can occur with people crossing the boundary - but I'm not VI.

    Because such a list would be a nightmare. You'd either be telling
everyone exactly what cheats were available in game by being specific, or
you'd be general enough that you'd get every rules lawyer in the game
throwing a "justified" tantrum whenever they got caught. Again - if you feel
any uncertainty, then /petition and ask a guide/GM if what you're doing is
an exploit. I'm sure they'd rather talk to you about that now as opposed to
warn you and put up with flak later.

    Then ask the only people whose judgement matters - the support staff.

    I have. Early reasons for it included (but were not limited to) stopping
players from rooting/snaring a mob, and simply evading the mob's attacks.

    Yeah, I wish it were that way too. Unfortunately, I doubt VI *can* code
a world working as intended. Whether it's lack of programming skills, lack
of desire/manpower, or lack of a proper solution (like the water/air thing),
I doubt we'll ever see an EQ where such broad-based rules aren't necessary.
And again - if you are in the least bit unsure, ask.

    Sadly, however, VI defines a bug as a coding feature that has unintended
consequences, NOT as a pure flaw. So if you find a way to fight risk-free
using the water/air boundary and spells, for example, then you would be
exploiting a bug as nothing in game was designed to allow you to fight
risk-free.
