I finally saw the bear Mammoth today.

Tried to feed him some Regurgitonic, but he agged on me first (I was a
little slow on the draw, being in shock at actually seeing him and all, and
he resisted my Calm spell....)  Once a critter aggs on you, you can't do a
trade with them.

I had to Flash of Light him and then Gate out so all his Ranger and Druid
friends wouldn't rip me to pieces.  I returned back to the Glade just in
time to watch him de-spawn right in front of my face.

Question:  Is Mammoth's spawn rate random?  Or is it a fixed time?  If so,
how long will I be waiting before I have a chance at seeing him again?  And
once he spawns, how long does he stay? (it seemed like he was around for
only about 10 minutes total).

Thanks!
