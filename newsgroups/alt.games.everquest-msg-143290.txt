Sigh... we just did this one.  It was a sub-thread of the humongous HIV 
muppet thread.  We already have different rules if you kil someone by 
accident (manslaughter) from killing someone on purpose (murder), so there 
is precedent for discriminatory enforcement on the basis of presence or 
absence of a motive.  Then there's the various degrees of murder...

We also have different rules for crimes against police officers versus 
crimes against non-police officers.  This is probably the best example of 
'special rights', as they have been called.

The hate crime legislation is generally not discriminatory as written.  It 
doesn't say, "for crimes against XX group", it says, "For crimes on the 
basis of not liking a particular characteristic".  Ie, rather than "for 
crimes against blacks and gays", it would say "for crimes motivated by 
race or sexual orientation".  So if you beat up a straight WASP because 
he's a straight WASP, you're still in deep doodoo.

'As written' and 'as enforced' may be a problematic distinction, though.  
But the lawmakers' intents seem clear enough.

It's really not that far-fetched to prosecute differently on the basis of 
the offending party's motive.  Why -shouldn't- two offenders get different 
sentences on the basis of motive?

If you're really interested, go look up that subthread.  We wasted the 
better part of a week on it, and I have no urge to rehash it all again.  
Maybe we should add it to the FAQ...  Hey, theres an idea... Someone 
should make a FAQ of all the questions that have been flamewarred to 
death, so we can just point people to the right part of the alt.flame 
heirarchy and be done with it.
