Lambent stones are not a no drop item but they are Lore I wouldnt pay more
then 10p which is double what they can be sold to a vendor. In Rath Mts in
HG Valley they are left on HGs all the time for anyone to loot because they
already have one. Depending on your level you can head there and get them
for free.
