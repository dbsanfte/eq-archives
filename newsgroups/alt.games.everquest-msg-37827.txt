October 16th for DAoC.

Like many AO players (now numbering more players online at peak times than
AC - not bad in 2 months), I am having a lag-free, disconnection-free time
on AO. I don't knock EQ, just pose the questions. I find the timing of the
disappearing server numbers more than a little coincidental, especially as
no meaningful reason has been given.

I won't disturb your camping any longer :)!
