Lol, it happens.  The other day I was invited to a group in WC with my alt
(lvl 12 bard) for derv camp...
"Play heal song, we don't have a healer", they said, so I do and 5 seconds
later these donkeys pull every single derv in the camp who all in turn aggro
on me because of heal song.  I didn't even have enough time to turn it off
before all the dervs are pissed.
Down I go.
"WTF" the leader says..."You died?  You suck!"
I just let him stew over it and found another group.  Better that way...
