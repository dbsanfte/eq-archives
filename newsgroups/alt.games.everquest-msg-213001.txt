Aye, I was a bit unclear there, but thats what I meant by it being "silly since
you have better HP buffs, including Temperance," putting the lesser Valor on
people means their HP is smaller than it could be.  But unless you are fighting
mobs so hard that CHeals are necessary, taking a couple hundred HP hit in your
maximum HP can be well worth it for the 1200 extra HP per minute in free
"regen", its just a matter of choosing your targets with a little care.  I
wouldn't reccomend this strategy in POP for example, where the mobs can easily
do 1200 hp damage in 6 seconds and you'll never notice the "regen" cause your
tank will be dead before the minute is up.

Symbol will still land, as will the AC buff, but not the regular HP buff, nor
will the Aego line, which now extends down to Temperance; thats the biggest
problem with this plan, when I was using it there was no such spell, so I
wasn't sacrificing nearly as much to use it.  Now there will be a palpable cost
in peridot, having to refresh symbol instead of getting Temperance duration out
of that same stone.
