I really would give EQ a try, in that case. A self-sufficient class such 
as a Druid would be right up your street; you don't actually *need* 
anybody, but you *can* be useful to others if you feel like it. 
Admittedly, you may never get your Epic weapon, or get into Vex Thal, 
but that is a very small part of what the game has to offer.
