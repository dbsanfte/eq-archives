You're missing a fundamental piece of the points system. Looting an item
costs you points. The exact numbers you'll have to tailor to suit your
raiding needs, but here's an example

A raid on Mob01 is worth 1pt
Hat01 from that raid is uber, and worth 10pts
Belt02 from that raid is fairly nice, so worth 6pts
Ring from that raid is fairly junky, so worth 2pts

Out of a possible 20 raids:
Raider01 attends 16 raids = 16pts
Raider02 attends 11 raids = 11pts
Raider03 attends 5 raids = 5pts

Raider01 can buy the hat if he wants, but that would drop him down to 6
points, and it's not a big upgrade. If he bought the Belt, he'd only
drop down to 10 points, but the hat is so much better, and there's an
uber belt worth 15 points he has his eye on from another mob. He could
buy the ring for fun, but why waste 2 points if he isn't going to use
it?

If Raider01 decides not to buy the hat, Raider02 gets a chance. It's a
bigger upgrade for him, so although looting it will drop him down down
to 1 point, it's worth it in his opinion.

Raider03 doesn't have much use for the ring, and can't afford the hat,
so doesn't buy anything

Now:
Raider01 = 17pts
Raider03 = 6pts
Raider02 = 1pts

Next day they kill Mob02 (worth 2 pts), and he drops the 15pt Belt that
raider01 has been waiting for. Raider02 looted something yesterday and
wants to rebuild points before buying something else, so doesn't loot
anything. Raider03 couldn't make it that night, since he's not on as
often

Now:
Raider03 = 6pts
Raider02 = 3pts
Raider01 = 2pts

So, in the space of 2 raids, the top guy has moved to the bottom, and
the bottom guy to the top. The part-time guy has first refusal on the
next thing he wants, but if he wants a major item, he'll have to wait
until he gets more points. In that time the regular players will have
gotten more points, and looted more items, but they will also need fewer
low-priced items, preferring to concentrate on the big ticket items.
Part-timer can either hold out for ages for the big drops, or take the
drops the major players prefer to skip.

In 5 raids, assuming none of them loot anything the values will be:

Raider01  = 10pts
Raider02  = 9pts
Raider03  = 8pts

Raider01 loots something else major, so does raider02, but raider03
holds out for the big ticket item. 10 raids after that they're at:

Raider01 attends 16 raids = 11pts
Raider02 attends 11 raids = 5pts
Raider03 attends 5 raids = 13pts

Raider03 loots his big item in around 3 times as long as it took
raider01. Seeing as raider01 raids 3 times as much, that seems fair.
Raider03 also has to option of picking up several smaller improvements
for less points instead of waiting for the big drops, so gets several
items. Or raider02 can... blah...blah...blah


I could go on with numerous different variables, but points is basically
a balancing system. You have to balance raids and values in such a way
that a few people can't loot whatever they want, useful or not, and
still stay in front. So that not everyone holds out for the major items,
but chooses lesser items instead. Over time that will change, so you'll
have to tweak the system from time to time. Most points systems start
with a model from a different guild, then gets tailored to specific
needs your guild has.
