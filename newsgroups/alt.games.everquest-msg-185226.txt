From the EQlive site...



Maelin Starpyre is the name of the brand new server opened in EverQuest. This is a standard rules, non-split, server.

As part of the launch of the Maelin Starpyre server, Sony Online Entertainment is also offering a specially revised Character
Transfer Service for this new server only.

For a fee, characters can be transferred to Maelin Starpyre with all equipment and coin intact and there will be no wait.

Normally when a new server opens in EQ, there is a customary waiting period of 6-months before character transfers may be requested
to the new server. Just for Maelin Starpyre, however, character transfers are available now!
