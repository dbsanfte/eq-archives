I'm leveling two Clerics on different servers on a very casual basis at
the moment. A month ago, I took the Dwarf from 20-22 on Enraged Goblins
in BBM. I'd log in kill the 3, then log to another char. Recently, I've
noticed that while leveling the High Elf Cleric from 18-19 at the same
spot, xp is significantly slower despite his lower level. Other than
this specific case, I can't say that I've noticed any difference
elsewhere and I solo quite a bit of the time lately.
