Having a drink in Slarena's honor.  Frozen Toe Rum comes from Halas, the
hometown of his character, a lvl 60 female Barbarian shaman.  Slarena
was one of the nicest people I knew on Povar.  It seemed only fitting to
drink a toast to that character's life.  

At one point there were 160 people in Lesser Faydark last night,
including 6 GMs (one of which was the lead GM for Povar), with at least
one person from almost all of the high-level guilds in attendence-- and
several mid-level ones, too.  I hear people say it's only a game and
that we shouldn't get worked up about people we'll never see
face-to-face.  That sounds callous to me, because that can be used as an
excuse to take advantage of other players, to treat them as things.  I
hate the circumstances that brought everyone to Lesser Faydark last
night, but I'm heartened to see that there are people out there who do
not regard their fellow players as quirky mobs and NPCs, but as real
humans.
