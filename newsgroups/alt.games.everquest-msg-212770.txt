This may seem like a very stupid question but..  can warriors use items with
a focus effect and actually *get* the effect? I've noticed that in the list
of classes that can use some of the items, is listed "warrior"..   but I was
under the impression that you had to be a caster of some sort in order to
get the effect from those items. Am I wrong? (it wouldn't suprise me if I
was. lol)
