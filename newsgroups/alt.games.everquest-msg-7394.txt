"Doing it wrong"?!?
Keeping my group alive and getting "mad exp" along with "phat lewt" is
doing it wrong?  What's doing it right?  Dying many times and running
to my corpse naked?  :-)

You mean like, "pull, kill, loot, pull, kill, loot, pull, kill, loot"
sorta repetition?

Let's put it this way, it's a safe bet I've played more characters,
more classes, at more levels than you have.  Admittedly, that's like
claiming out of all the people who have no lives, I'm king of the hill
(or damn close to it), it is unfortunately for me, the truth.

About the only class I have not played to 55+ is a bard...quite
frankly, I don't need carpal tunnel that badly.
