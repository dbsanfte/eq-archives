Hiya Gang!

I have Grim's rune and now I need to get the heart from Inferno Gobby in Sol
A.  I bumbled into Grimmy's rune when a very nice uber Druid killed him and
asked if I wanted the rune since I was only ranger in zone at that time.
Now I'm wondering if I stand a chance in Hades of surviving Sol A long
enough to get Heart.

I'm less than one yellow bub away from 33, so would it help out much to stay
at Paw and get 33 before heading for Sol A?  I can get some Guildies to come
along, but I worry about getting people killed on a quest that is strictly
to get something to benefit my character.  If I can just sneak in there with
Camo, find gobby, kill it and providing it drops the heart, book it out of
there I would rather do that.

The odds of that are basically slim to none from what I've read however...
LOL

Anyone have any advice on how to get the gobby I need aside from going
there, sitting inside the zone and asking for permission to loot the heart.
I don't do that either, but I have seen plenty of other folks doing it.

Thanks!
