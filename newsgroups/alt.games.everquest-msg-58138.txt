If you're going to try to backpedal like that, you should really try a
forum where you can erase your previous posts so they aren't sitting
there waiting to make an ass out of you. Let's see what you said that
started this little tangent, shall we?

Lol thats complete crap.   Excluding uber mobs (on the level of Vindi,
Statue and King Tormax) a SK makes as good of a MA as a warrior, and in
some
cases a better one.

Anything else to say? No? I thought not.

Bzzzzt. Wrong again. Trying to backpedal to cover up the fact you're
passing off fucked up information is hard with all your previous posts
right here. And as to your "my gear is nothing special", yeah. We *all*
have low level characters with fungi tunics. LOL!

*sigh* And again, I suppose we'll have to go back and *QUOTE* for you
what you just posted, since you're obviously too stupid to remember what
you type:

Hrmmm..... "...when I was being stupid.. like HTing a level 50 mob when
im level 6..."
I wonder where on earth I could have gotten the idea that you were
talking about HTing a level 50 mob when you were level six? I really
must brush up on my reading comprehension skills.

Oh, dear. All this cutting and pasting from your OWN fucking posts may
give me carpal tunnel, but if it helps you in some way, I suppose it's
worth the selfless sacrifice on my part.

So if you *always* press the taunt button, (and that's not out of
context folks. It's your entire statement on the subject) then I guess
in fifty some levels you've never been in an xp group with a warrior
tank? Give it up junior. You said every bit of the bullshit I'm
responding to and been called on. Own it or quit.

That's too funny to even respond to. Unless you play with SKs who never
cast their spells and never go after any weapons besides the rusty
longsword they had in E. Freeport at level three. But if you're so sure
that the SK's will not outdamage the warriors, then I guess we'll never
have to worry about the warriors holding aggro around them, right?
(Let's wait and see what you have to say about that at the end of this
hilarious post.)

To answer: Fifty-one champion. And yes, we're all in awe of how uber you
are. (Everyone /bow down to martin now until he stops pouting.) But
oddly, I still get asked to go there all the time. Many spawn areas
(though certainly not the King) can be done by low fifties groups
without uberguild backing. Oh, and by the way... in that last paragraph
you just once again said that any warrior under 58 can't out taunt your
SK who was.... what level again? And you still think SK's don't
outdamage the warriors? Or are you just mashing your taunt button again?
