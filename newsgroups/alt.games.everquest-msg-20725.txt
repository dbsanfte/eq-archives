 I think I have been playing long enough, I didnt start right away like some
I got EQ about 5 months after it had hit the street. Im sure there are a lot
of people who like and want to have naming rulse, I am NOT saying we should
throw them all out the window. There are a lot of people who like to
/report/ petition if they see a name that they feel does not meet the naming
policy, I have no problems with them either. If there were no rule about
"game genre" would they still /report/petition? no because no rule was
broken. The rules are too open to interpretation, mine, yours, Verants...
why can't they fix them? I don't like vagueness in rules. That's why I have
a problem with them.
And why is it whining to try and get something changed?
Look I follow ther rules as they are put down too, I just don't like them.

400,000 subscribers...did you realize if thats true they are raking in over
3 million a month?
