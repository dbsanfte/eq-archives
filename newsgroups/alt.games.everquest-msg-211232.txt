Couldn't agree more.  It's just a game, for God's sake.

Intentional separation by any one group tends to give rise to animosity from
those not of the group.  That extends to the individual as well.  I realize
this is a generalization, but IMO folks tend to not want to make the extra
effort to get the wallflower off the wall ... they just dismiss them as
'antisocial' and stay within their own group of friends.

To return this to the game setting, every guild I've ever been in had an
individual who always soloed ... no matter how many times someone asked them
along on a hunt, they politely declined.  After a while, you just stop
asking.  You think, "Why waste the keystrokes?".

Separation by choice is still separation.  If being separate is what you're
hoping to achieve, great.  If acceptance from the general population is your
goal, though, taking bold steps to separate yourselves from that same
general population is probably not the best way to do it.
