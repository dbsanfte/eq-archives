I disagree, after 20th INT items are the way to go.  nothing wrong with
having mana items also, but you should run a calculation on Castersrealm to
see which items your considering will give you more mana.  also INT items
are nice if your SK/necro/mage/enc/wiz for training in trade skills.  my
understanding is it uses your highest INT or WIS for increases.

that is usually the biggest problem with groups.  you can have a tough time
on your own unless you know exactly where to hunt, and what to do.  You can
spend alot of time looking around trying to find the right spot, and you
probably should do this if your interested in solo-ing.  I remember grouping
with others and dying alot, which would frustrate the hell out of me.  When
you find a good group though, you don't die and do very well on exp.

Unrest, Guk, and Mistmoore come to mind. all are good at 20 + level.  at
25th I found the dungeon near Feeroot with lizzies to be fun, cazic thule.
I'm sure their are a ton more places to hunt with kunark and velious.

If someone tells you there is only one place to hunt, its a joke.  tons and
tons of places to hunt at every level.

I've started running a necro on sullon zek, and found I run out of mana fast
even at 4th level.  I found the need to conserve casting.  You should only
use the big Dot's when you need them.  Another idea is to group with an
enchanter, since they can breeze you (16th).  The mellee buffs and debuffs
easily change a fight from losable to winnable.  not even counting mezzing
adds/multiples.
