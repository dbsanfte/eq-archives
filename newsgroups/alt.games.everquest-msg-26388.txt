    It could be cycled quite quickly. Kill the pet (no faction hits?), Mem
Blur Tovax and the very next thing he'll do is.... summon another pet.
Cha-ching!

    There used to be several NPCs in game that didn't assist their pets when
the pets were attacked - Cynthia in Rathe Mtns. was the most famous. Since
pets are quite weak for the level, generally have no faction hits, and since
the pets would be instantly re-cast, people would make crazy XP on them. I
wouldn't be surprised if on either a poor, new server (Sullon) or if an
older player came across this that the player wouldn't sit and kill the pet
over and over.
