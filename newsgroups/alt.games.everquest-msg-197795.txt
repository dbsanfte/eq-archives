I've never once seen banishing work out in trials.  I can see how you might
get lucky and have say two rocks spawn per wave and get no resists, but the
resist rate is high enough that you really can't count on banishing to get the
job done, and its very expensive (not counting the PP cost) to use and fail
with.  Often a failed banish means a failed trial, even if you can finish that
wave off, you've lost so much mana that you can't make it up in the long run.

I've done trials with mages and druids both who did -not- use banishment, and
had much better luck that way.

Trouble is, its not a single mob that you have to get, its an endurance test
as much as anything else; people say its DPS, and it is, but its also
-sustained- DPS, kill mob after mob after mob with little rest.  You need to
be able to repeat your kill consistantly, 4 times in a row, 4 clusters in a
row.  To get enough rocks that banishment will make a difference, and yet get
no resists, means relying too much on sheer luck.

Absent Banishment, you get a substandard DS, a substandard healer, a
substandard nuker, no slow at all, and someone that can't take a beating if
they get heal aggro or nuke aggro.  Druid is a great class in many regards,
but in the tight confines of a trial group, "second best in several
categories" doesn't make up for "not the best for the job" in any one
category.

Mage gives you better nukes, a pet, and a better DS; given a choice between
the two, I'd go with the mage here, even if the druid had banishment and a
pocket full of star rubies and the mage did not (not uncommon to find a mage
without this spell)
