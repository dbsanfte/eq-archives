Just FWIW: This has been the case since day one. It actually seems better
now. Dan's suggestions were good but I would substitute the shallow
breath/choke line of spells in there before any the feeb stuff. Fear is
really nice and Chaotic Feedback is a great burn spell you get at 8. Some
spells that you will use a lot in crowd situations you really don't need
until you are high enough to get in crowd situations.

Doesn't matter. You can either be given your spells and not need money or
just buy the ones you need and have more then enough money to do that.

The other thing you will notice is that your needed spell casting skills may
not go up as fast as your level. If you ever make it to a dock and see half
a dozen people casting spells on themselves, that is why.

If you chose agnostic under religon it makes a huge difference. An 8th level
agnostic Dark Elf chanter is IMO the best money maker in the game until
level 24.
