I've raided every pre-Luclin high-level zone OTHER than Sleeper's Tomb.  In 
other words, I don't just poke my head in an mark it off of a list.  I haven't 
explored them completely, but I've seen a lot of places that most level 60s 
never have or will.

OK, then I guess you have reading comprehension problems.  You want a zone where 
only appropriate level people can get loot, Verant puts those zones in, you 
claim to have visited them, yet you still whine that we need zones where loot 
only drops for appropriate level people.  You're whining that something doesn't 
exist when IT DOES EXIST, and the vast majority of players found they didn't 
like it at all.

Oh, excuse me for assuming that you have any logic.  You write a whiny post 
about how all the expansions are for high-level characters, crying that they 
need to create more low-level content.  Then you admit that you haven't come 
CLOSE to experiencing all the level-appropriate content?  Are you serious?  Can 
you be this dense?  Why would you be any more likely to explore the new content 
than the existing content that you haven't seen yet?

Ok, you are an idiot.  A complete and utter ignoramous.  How many fucking zones 
do you want?  In the latest expansion the following zones have mobs in the 15-30 
level range:  Marus Seru, Dawnshroud Peaks, Netherbian Lair, Twilight Sea, Echo 
Caverns, Shadeweavers Thicket, Paludal Caverns, Hollowshade Moor, AND Grimling 
Forest.  That is 9 new zones, for low/mid-levels, and you're still whining.  Go 
fall in The Hole.

Maybe because you hang around sheep.  Why don't you talk to the people in your 
server's raiding guilds.  They're the ones who are asking for the new content, 
as they're the ones who actually have explored 90% of the high level zones.

No, someone who whines about not having a feature in the game, and continues to 
whine about it when the desired feature DOES exist, and has this fact pointed 
out to them is either an idiot or a troll.
