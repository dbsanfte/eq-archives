Right now, my level 24 beastlord is hunting in Marus Saru for
Greyhoppers. They drop hides that sell well in the bazaar. Also, LDoN
adventures can net your group between 25 and 50 plat for each person
in your group per adventure, depending on how many gems, weapons, etc
drop off of mobs. Also, at that level, LDoN is a great way to earn xp.
And at higher levels, you have even more options available for you to
earn money, such as hill giants, higher level LDoN adventures, better
drops off of mobs to sell in the bazaar, etc...
