The giant and barbed bone skellies run in the low to mid twenties, so
you'd need to con them and be selective on which ones you attack. The
Skeletons seem to run the upper end of the range and can be mid to upper
teens, and should still give xp for you in many cases. Dry bones are 15
to 20, same there. But don't limit yourselves just to them. There are
drakes of nearly every lower level range in Rathe, and if you're evil
types and not worried about faction, a variety of NPC's in the
teens/twenties you might pick off. Check the beastiary for more details.
