With male-male you'd also have to have a host parent unless someone manages
to develop the technology to carry the baby to term in an artificial womb.

Speaking of which, if it could be proven that there would be no harmful
effects to having a baby carried in an artificial womb, I think that could
turn out to be something worth having... I've known a few women who would
love to have kids but are terrified of the various difficulties of
pregnancy/pain of giving birth... an artificial womb would solve those
problems, although, again, I'm not sure whether it would be healthy for a
baby to be carried outside of a human body, in fact I don't know what
effects it might have on the baby's psyche at all, assuming it would even
work.
