There probably is a way to find this out.  If you click on the Rank by
Population option in the Server Select screen it will still sort. My guess
is that the information is sent to your computer anyway, just not displayed.
It would be a fairly simple matter to make a program that could decipher
that information.  Of course doing so probably breaks Verants very harsh
"Vision".
