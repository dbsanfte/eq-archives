LOIO is where my Druid achieved 20 and 21 this weekend. Go by the Mill and 
find a tank to partner with. Let the tank go grab stuff while you guys med. 
The tank comes back, you DS him, snare the mob, DoT it (if it's white or 
higher), and med for heals and the next pull. Strength of Earth, Skin like 
Rock, and SoW the tank as necessary. The only buff yuou need is Skin Like 
Rock, SoW, and Barbcoat. With this arrangement, and a fairly safe camp, you 
should be able to suck up exp. The big thing to worry about is overpulls, 
but with the FV zone so close and your attention to SoW that should not be 
a problem.
