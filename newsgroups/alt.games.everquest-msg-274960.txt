1)  Logged in, and went to the Crypt of Betrayal to see if I could get into
a pickup group to do Armor Quest 4. No luck finding a group.
2) While waiting for somebody to show up for AQ4, I decide to
try to solo the blue con mobs I need for the quest. No luck
soloing them since Sony instituted the anti-soloing nerfs.
3)Waited another 15 minutes for a pickup group. No luck finding a
group after another 15 minutes.
4) Gave up and ran to Thunderring Steepes to see if I could find a
pickup group for the Spindlecog helm or dwarven boots quest.
No luck finding a group in the Thunderring Steepes instance.
5) Zoned into the second TS instance. Find a group camping
the spawn I need for the boots quest! Cool! Come to find out
one of the toons in the group is eight levels above me - meaning
I can't join their group and get credit. No luck finding a group.
6) Run back to the crypt of betrayal to see if an AQ4 group
is forming. No luck finding a group.
7) Log out after a couple of hours running around looking for
a group.

I'm *this close*  (holds figurative fingers an inch apart) to canceling
my eq2 account.

I'm even playing a healer as my main since I thought it would be easier to
get pickup groups.

Blizzard - save a place for me on one of your servers.
