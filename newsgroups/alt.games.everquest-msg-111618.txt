You're complaining about how Verant isn't going to give you a free
gift for all the time you've spent playing EverQuest. The reality of
the situation is that the only free gift you're ever going to get for
playing a lot of EverQuest is a flabby midsection.

There are numerous things that people should be complaining about when
it comes to Verant (fuck the regulars in this group -- they're a bunch
of lapdogs). This isn't even on the list.
