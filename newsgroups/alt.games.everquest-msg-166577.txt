one of the most signifigant things you will soon find is the East
Commonlands tunnel is a ghost town with the advent of the Bazaar zone
introduced in the Shadows of Luclin expansion, and the Translocate line of
spells.  Another plus you'll find is with the introduction of the Planes of
Power expansion, high end dungeons of old, such as Trakanon's lair, Sleepers
Tomb, Temple of Veeshan have been vacated by the likes of the guild Ascent,
thus paving the way for more moderate guilds to get some of the nice Velious
armor and weapon content previously less available.  Best regards, its a
great time to experience Everquest as you couldn't before.
