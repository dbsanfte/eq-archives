There really is only a few places at which to camp without having wandering
Goblins coming around.  I have found, at least while soloing, that across from
the Wood Room (see atlas) on level four is a decent place since the wanderers
are few and far between.  Once the wood room is cleared, you can usually pull
only one or two at a time and not have to worry about a massive train forming. 
Plus, you are very close to a merchant and a bank which will allow you to
sell/bank without the long run to rivervale.  Blackened Allow drops pretty
frequently off the goblins on level 4.
