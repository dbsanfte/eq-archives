What's the point anyway? He can reset the password any time he chooses.

The only thing that can happen is that his char's get stripped clean, but
the account is his again so he can fall back.
If this was a true thing you simply ought to get him to cancel his
creditcard and stop him from getting a new one.

Anyway, sounds like a "I want to annoy this person big time" more then a "I
want to help this guy".
