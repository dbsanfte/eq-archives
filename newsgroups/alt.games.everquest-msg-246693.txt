Yes we will see but as I said the full DX9.0 compliance is with P 2.0
(Pixel Shaders) and Nvidia has a very kludgy way of implementing them
which is why their cards are so much slower.

Agreed but I said why would SOE go for a half baked solution for DX9
and why switch to DX9 at all if they are not?

Because they have said they are on their dev boards.  In fact they are
using this excuse as to why they are a bit strapped for time atm.  If
you are interested do a search for Brenlo or Ashlanne (one of them said
it.

Precisely my argument no mention of a third party solution so imo they
are heading for full DX9.0 compatibility.

Nvidia will finally catch up to the the DX9 spec in DX9 9.0c.
