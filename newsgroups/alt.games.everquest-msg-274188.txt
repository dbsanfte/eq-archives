I see the concept of simile is lost on you.

The definition of pussy meaning coward is derived from the vulgar term for a 
female's anatomy.  The fact that you emphatically deny this without any 
proof does not change that fact.

Coward != cat, what's so hard to undestand?  Why do you think we started 
using the term pussy to refer to a wuss?  Are words not derived in your 
bizzaro world?  Do we just pull them out of thin air without concern for 
precident or usage?  In answer to your question, what's so hard to 
understand is why you refuse to accept that you're wrong.  Have you somehow 
become so vested in your argument that you can't back down without it 
destroying your tender ego?
