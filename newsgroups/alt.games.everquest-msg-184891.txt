Hmm I'd disagree with that. Anarchy Online must be more like Daoc I
think, or in the middle maybe. In AO you kind of "hard zone" (like you
zone in EQ) Only once in a great while usually.. from one huge square
area to the next. You can kind of run forever before you hit a zone
though, like forever forever. Like the way they talked up how big the
EQ world was at launch really IS how big AO is, and more. They talked
EQ up a lot but you could run across the entire thing in around 45
minutes. I've been out in AO with a run buff on and lots of points in
run speed, at level 36, and ran for that long WITHOUT ZONING.

Not zoning makes it seem a heck of a lot larger to me. You actually
get scared out there in AO.

AHAHA yes. Something else that always bugged me is a guild guy
wants you to get rabbit ears or rat ears or something. You are an
adventurer, the elite, yet for some reason whenever an npc wants stuff
like this you have to kill 3 billion mobs before one drops rat ears.
Try this in real life:

Send me to an area with rabbits or rats with a gun and a pocket knife.
Tell me you want "rat ears" or "rabbits ears."  Not even knowing what
the heck I'm doing, you'll have them in 20 minutes. You kill the
thing, its laying there dead with ears, its not rocket science.

No, you build up xp debt. So if you are 5,000 points into level 3
(just an example) then you die 3 times you might build up 10,000 
points of xp debt. You still stay where you were in level 3, but
before you can progress beyond that 5,000 you have to go through that
10,000 xp debt. Sounds pretty horrible, but I heard you can reduce it
by performing quests or something at your guild.

On the official EQOA board is seems not a lot of people in game have
keyboards. Its something that a pc user would do right away with a
EQOA setup, get a usb keyboard cheap. Some people who have played 
regular EQ say they get the keyboard and only use it to chat a bunch,
otherwise they use the ps2 controller.

My guess is grouping is very random and pick up. I don't think you'll
ever see people on cell phones like that office guy and such talking
about killing a dragon, yeah.. right.

Have you not played EQ lately? WIth legacy of ykesha you auto record
what an npc says, then you open up that UI window at the top and hit
save. You can also delete all the stuff other npcs said you don't want
to save. This is great for keeping track of where you are with quests
in an area.

You also can take notes with

/note
