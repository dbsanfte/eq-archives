This is class dependant for soloing... but generally any group gets 
better exp per hour than any soloer, and groups are rarely so dependant 
on class or type of mob.

Soloing, I found that the break point was level 62-63 for my cleric; at 
that point getting exp of any type, solo, became much more difficult, 
and it would literally have been worth my while to lose a level in order 
to get AA much faster.

But then I got into group mode for a bit, and pumped up to 65 in under a 
week.

This was before the radical changes to group exp, which makes a group 
much much more worthwhile than it used to be; formerly the bonus was 
barely large enough to make up for the hassle of having more people who 
might  go afk or do something silly; now its so huge that when it comes 
to a sixth person, you are literally better off picking up someone who 
will put you on Autofollow and go afk for the next three hours than you 
would be staying at 5 people.

But even then, even a semi decent group pretty much eliminated the "wow 
those mobs went light blue on me, what do I kill now" worries.

Oh, additionally, they changed the level range at which mobs go LB for 
the 60+ crowd, and they added even more enormous bonuses for killing 
mobs close to your level;  so again a group (which can kill higher level 
mobs fast enough to make the bonus worth the trade in kills per hour) is 
often a much better way to go.
