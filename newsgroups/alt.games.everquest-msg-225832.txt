Thanks for all the replies, guys.  I talked to a few lizard owners and none
had found any special qualities that horses don't have, so that combined
with the lack of information on the net leads me to believe that the rumors
were just that: rumors, no more.

I decided, finally, on a nice red (well, red and white) drogmor, but bought
the wrong drum and wound up with green.  I might eventually trade it in and
eat the 2500 plat to get the color I want, but for now, I stand out with the
green--I don't see many of them on my server.

I opted for the drogmor because my Enchanter already has a horse, and
targeting is a bitch.  It *is* easier on the drogmor.  Plus the little
(Gnome-sized) lizard is kinda cute.  I'm finding it invaluable for the
character I put it on--a (then) level Gnome 10 necromancer.  ::blushes:: My
first ever serious self-twink!  (Some other chars of mine got tons of nice
handmedowns from guildmates.)  Now I can't imagine playing a necro without a
mount.

And would you believe I never knew the /dismount command until you guys
mentioned it?  That's what I get for not playing for ages.  It's a lifesaver
now that I know it.
