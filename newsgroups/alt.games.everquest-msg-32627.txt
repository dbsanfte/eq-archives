Yes, I realize this.  I weigh the decision to depart heavily.

I only do one private tell the the offender.  If they don't stop, I do it in
group say.  If they continue, I tell the group I won't continue being part
of the group if the offending behavior isn't stopped.  If the group members
don't say anything and the jerk continues, I tell them good-bye and gate.  I
do wait until the current pull is over and then do it.  I've only rarely had
to go to this extreme of a measure.

Normally what happens is after I do the group say, at least one person pipes
up and tells off the offender.  Not surprisingly it is the enchanter.  As
far as my experience goes in the game, it seems us clerics and enchanters
watch each other's back and pipe up when the group is doing the other wrong.
Anyway ... I also get private tells from group members at this point.  I
quickly know who's on my side and who isn't.  Sadly it is usually a tank
that is the problem and if it gets past this stage, they're also the group
leader.   If they continue misbehaving past this point, the offender usually
gets booted from the group or, if they're the leader, the group disbands and
reforms with me as its leader.

If the no one in the group pipes up for me after I've done a group say or,
after the jerk does the offending behavior again after I point it out in
group say, I really don't want to group with any of those individuals ever
again.  If they whine to their friends, I figure I'd get the same treatment
from them so would actually appreciate it if they do whine.  I've also found
that members of guilds reflect their guilds.  If they're a jerk, their guild
is full of jerks.  As for fearing that I won't get able to get a group in
the future, I really don't.  At my stage at least, being a cleric, I never
have a problem getting an invite. Maybe that will change as I raise in
levels, but so far just the opposite has happened.  Also, happily fewer and
fewer of the episodes have happened as I've risen higher and higher in
levels.

Ugh.  =(

I've heard of this loot system but in all 34 levels I've never experienced
it once.

Never heard of this plat for Symbol.  Anyone else experience this loot
system?
