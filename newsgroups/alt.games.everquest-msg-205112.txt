If that were the case it would be "required level" and not "recommended
level", don't you think?

That's quite a leap between your alternatives there.  I hadn't realized
that there was no middle ground.  :-p

Looks to me like James is right, with a recommended level giving
full use of the item to a character who would be a liability to
a group in the zone (due to agro issues) it looks like a pretty
clear case of "designed for twinking".  If it were required level
of 45 and recommended level of 55, for instance, it would look
like "designed as a reward for the character(s) looting it".

just my 2 cents,
