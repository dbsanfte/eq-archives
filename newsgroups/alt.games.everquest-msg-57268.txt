Assuming that druids are like the rest of the casters, in your guild
area there will be at least two different types of NPCs. One type are
the trainers. If you right click on them you get the training window
where you can put training points into skills. The others, however, are
vendors. If you right click on them, a vendor window will pop open with
all the items the merchant has to offer. If you left click on any given
item, the merchant will state what it is, and how much he charges for
it. If you elect to buy it, there's a little "Buy" button down below
that, when clicked, will purchase the item, deduct the money from what
you have on you, and move it into your inventory. (Assuming you have
room, of course.) 

Alternately, you can right click on any item and hold down the mouse
button. This will bring up a window in place of the chat screen which
will show you not only the name of the item, but any relevant
information. In the case of spells, it will tell you if you can use it,
what level is required to use it, what type of spell it is, (e.g.
divination, conjuration, etc.) casting time, mana cost, and other stuff. 

Some of the merchants will be selling general merchandise, food,
containers, weapons, etc. You're looking for one of the ones that sells
primarily spells. The icon for the spells will look like a piece of
parchment.

Hope that helps.
