Yeah, the point of playing a mob is not to hunt to players, but to
hunt OTHER players playing mobs. I played for a long time on test.
Mobs can do emots, at least skeletons can dance, bow and everything a
regular player was doing.

Remember, keep run off, always walk in a striaght line, don't use
mouse look, and you can survive a little longer than the moss snake
you see spinning around and running all erradic, like players normally
do.
