Oddly, I have found that if you target yourself, then /assist, you can
get your attacker targeted, and sometimes the spells will go off. Once
targeted, I con it, if I can take it, I try a spell. If the spell
goes, I start underground kiting. Run by walls and cliffs, you can
sometimes pull them out from under the world that way. 
Of course, if you are a meatsheild, you are pretty screwed.
