Easy, there, Ms. Ranger Lady, Ma'am. I'm just a conservationist.
I clean up the bear meat that the OTHER poachers leave lying around
Norrath and make something useful out of it. Heck, I'm not close to
strong enough to go picking on bears. (Well, I think I could take a
black bear now, but I haven't tried it yet.)

Heck, I'd much rather be making Mammoth Steaks. Bigger stat bonus
and more servings per hunk of meat. I'm just not brave enough
yet to head to the Great White North and look for dead mammoths. :-P
