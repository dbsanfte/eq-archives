If X drops randomly from all over the world nobody will devise tactics 
to fight the death touching dragon god with the 6000 dd aoe.

So far so good.

Yup. Instancing works well for this. It doesnt' require a massive amount 
of work to implement and it gets the job done.

Not necessarily. Although it helps.

No. It just moves the bottleneck to the trigger.

The general premise of EQ is that to get a specific reward you need to 
defeat a specific sort of encounter. Its not the only premise for loot 
distribution, but its not a bad one, and EQ players are pretty happy 
with it overall.

That's a 'feature' of EQ, and it is part of its flavour. People like the 
idea of: If I want an X, I must find and kill The Great Keeper of X to 
get it. His name is Great Keeper of X and he dwells in heart of the 
Temple of Xness.

There's something missing from the experience when you decide you want 
an X, and your solution is to find a corner of the world that has 
unengaged mobs and slay them until an X drops. Even having the named 
randomly pop in the temp of Xness sucks... you get players who simply 
camp the door... why fight my way to the heart of the temple if the X is 
just as likely to pop and drop right here.

Its one of the things that differentiates EQ from D2.

Instancing lets more than one person invade the temple of Xness fight to 
the heart and slay the great keeper of X at a time, and that is a *good 
thing*.

Increased drop rates by themselves simply reduce timesinks and 
ultimately increases the mudflation rate.

Personally, for EQ, I'd favour something that hasn't been done yet: 
microinstancing. Where the dungeon is shared as most are now, but 
instead of spawning the great keeper of X, you go to the 'Temple of 
Xness' and you obtain a key to the heart of the temple of Xness. And 
that key opens a door somewhere in the dungeon that takes you to a 
microzone called the Heart of the Temple of Xness. And its a tiny zone 
with a scripted encounter with the Keeper of X and his closest minions.

Everyone can get the key to X by hunting wherever they want want in the 
temple of X... but they don't miss out (or can't "skip out" depending on 
your perspective) on the journey to the heart of the temple, and the 
unique encounter with the Great Keeper of the X.
