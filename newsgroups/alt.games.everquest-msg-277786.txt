I'm not sure if it will turn out to be a big deal. Buying and selling
items for real money happens now on all servers. Legitimising it will
encourage more people to do it but many won't

And if it's just on a few servers those servers will end up as gettos
where I won't play on.

As for crafting not having to make all the sub combines will help. As a
provisioner you used to be able to buy them, you can't now. If you
have to make them, make it so the trivials ones take no time at all to
make.
