I just gave this feedback to Verant the other day while playing. Some idiot
and his cronie were purposely taking a camp spawn that I had been working on
all day. Everyone in the zone agreed that I had been there all day and this
guy was using the excuse that he was KOS and the Camp just agro'd on him and
there was nothing he and his friend could do, yet every time after taking
the camp, they would sit right in the middle of it and it would all start
over again. One thing leads to another and unfortunately a pissing constest
insues.

I used the /feedback command in game and my suggestion was that they add a
feature to the /ignore list that you could comment on why a player is there.
Being a former guide and having knowledge of the soulmarking system, they
could implement the same type of thing with the /ignore command. You could
be able to type /ignore <playername> KS's and general mischief and that way,
when you pulled up your ignore list, you would remember why a player had
been put there and you could weed them out at a later time.

Anyway, you might try putting your suggestion into a /feedback command and
maybe Verant will get the idea that this is a badly needed feature.
