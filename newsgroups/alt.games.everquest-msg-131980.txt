 Just rattling your cage!! LOL ,I have no sulutions to the prophecy at
 hand! I am simply amazed that the  bible's Revelations are still
 pointing fingers at Isreal ,being the main topic of concern.Seems as
 though Nastrodamous might have had visions instead of Quartrains.
 However a persons heritage should not play favoratism.I believe JESUS
 was not Mexican but was a Jew and he would have made a fine Vice
 president same as Chaney could have been the President .I did not
vote
 for Bush but If he runs again I will. Was that politically correct?
On second thought I do have an opinion as to what is happening.I have
been mighty fortunate to be born an American and not had to cope with
such dreadful things.It seems to me like I am stuck in a time warp and
things that should have been improved have not progressed at all.Like
the days of the gladiators fighting till their death to please the
crowd.To me this is Barbaric had civilization not froze in time and
education was plentiful then teaching men to be fishers to provide for
themselves would feed them for a lifetime.But what went wrong ?The
educated learned how to decieve the less fortunate and keep them at
bay.Then greed set in and there was no other way but to survive except
through evil deception.Now we've been reading this for centuries and
have not believed in it's truth.So what to do a drastic change has got
to be made or there will be no getting along!!Traveling down the same
path will always lead to the same place in time! The problem is its
not the "yellow brick road" its reality!!
