Err, it's not like I go out hunting for infractions. Someone catches
my attention with a blatantly bad name, it gets reported and I go on
about my business.

And, by the way, it's not "page"...

Tell me, how does someone reporting a name harm the atmosphere of the
game? You don't KNOW they reported the name unless it happens to be
your name and the GM shows up to change it, and even then, as far as
you know, the GM just happened across you in his travels...
