You're speaking to the person who wears black chitin leggings over
gatorscale leggings for looks, remember?

You are right about me thinking of forking out 400pp/265pp +whatever
profit margin the jeweler wants for 5.8 mana as a No Brain
investement, though. 

(Getting velium diamond rings was a justifiable good thing, since I
didn't already have plat diamond rings. Upgrading my plat wis jewelry
to velium when there are so many other things that'd make for more
interesting upgrades when I get around to them? No thanks.)
