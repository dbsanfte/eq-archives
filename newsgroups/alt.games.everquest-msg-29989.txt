I first ran into in Oasis.  I am going a bit slower there now because I need
*extra* mana beyond what any blue target will require, simply so I can
finish off the target faster if someone jumps in.  In fairness though, 90%
of the people that jump in on something I'm root/rot'n will apologize and
back off once they realize what I'm doing.

Worst so far was another druid who couldn't have been more than a level
difference of me who stood and watched me root and launch swarm then decided
to open up whupass on the critter.  My mojo was stronger I guess as I
finished *my* kill, and took *my* loot.

I just discovered the Eastern Plains of Karana last night!  This is gonna be
some fun.
