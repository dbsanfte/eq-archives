I just installed my new Leadtek A250 (Geforce4ti4400) and after installing
the drivers that came with the box my whole gamma/contrast and most
importantly digital vibrance page has been replaced with just my monitors
color profile. Everything looks so dull compared to what it did on my GF2. I
promply went to nvidia's site and installed the newest drivers from them but
my digital vibrance bar is still gone.

Can anyone please help????
