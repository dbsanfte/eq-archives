Really the only why this could be done is if the bug still works. Other wise
the "hacker" would have to have hacked into the server and IF they keep
passwords stored there, would have to de crypt it. The only other thing I can
think of is that your friend gave out his password or he is trying to pull off
a big scam. All the log proves is that all the items were givin to this guy,
that's ALL it can prove, and to my understanding, last time i checked, this is
not against ANY rules to give people your stuff, it that was the case next time
someone pisses me off i'll hand them all my stuff then report them that they
"hacked" me. just lame to go acusing someone of hacking your account because
they recevied items.
