 I just have a Quick Question I am playing the game as a Dark Elf
Necromancer, and I have been Collecting Wolf Meat And Bear Meat And
Chunks of Meat Along with catching my own fresh Fish.  This may sound
stupid but I just started out and just ran out of the bread cakes you
start with my question is will my chracter eat the meat, or do I have
to bake it or somthing along those lines?  And I am now at level six
thank-you in advance for any help.  Also What do I need to Bake my own
Bread?

Thanks again Nightwind
