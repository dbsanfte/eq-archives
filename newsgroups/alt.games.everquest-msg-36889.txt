The best place for rezzes are where lots of player go and that means lots
die Rathe Mts. Lower Guk Ocean of Tears, Lake of Ill Omen, Eastern
Wastelands. Just to name a few. The going rate is around 50p for a 39 100p
for a 49. And for the beggars just ask them what is your exp worth to you I
have to med about 5 min after a rez and heal.
