Most of us didn't want a game that was non-stop action like a fps.
First person shooter != role playing game. If you wanted that, then
you are part of the poison that has so damaged EQ to date.

It was one factor, yes.

Real life has a lot of other things going in its "immersiveness"
favor. Don't make the mistake of thinking one thing by itself means
anything by itself. The role of PoK in the context of EQ was
world-damaging. That does not mean there is no place for books that
transport people in any game ever.
