No.

Your mana is based on your wisdom times your level.  More wisdom means
more
mana at every level, from one to 60.

Over 200, wisdom only gives you one mana per wisdom, so getting it any
higher
than that isn't very useful.

The rumor you heard has been twisted at some point; the actual logic
goes like this:
at level 25, one point of wisdom is equal to five mana.  Mana items are
relatively
cheap, and at levels under 25, have a larger proportional effect on your
mana
than do wisdom items.

Because of this, people who have access to both wisdom and mana items
tend
to wear mana items from 6 to 25, more or less, and then swap in their
wisdom
items as they become more effective.

On the other hand, wisdom also influences your success rate with trade
skills,
so if you are doing some work on those lines, then wisdom items are more

valuable to you than mana items (which don't do a darn thing for your
successes)
