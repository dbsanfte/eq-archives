Yeah, that was my experience precisely.  Except for the UP part. :) I 
noticed it not working when I was trying to avoid faction hits in KC, and 
kept getting them anyway unless I spent 200 mana or so a mob.  I've noticed 
that the blur component in mezzes seems to work suprisingly often, on the 
other hand.  If I mez, debuff, and then mez again as the last step, there's 
a fair chance the mob won't come for me.

}hate.  Kinda like it.

I should really get around to trying that more often.  Although it never 
answers what I really want to know:  Will the mob hate me most if I sit 
down now? :)  Savin' up for that horse... :)
