VS could be done "in the olden days" (velious) by 2 end-guild people (a
guild who at the time had nToV and Sleepers gear, but not AoW loot)..  its
up to you to decide if clearing velious is "uber" or not, but whilst back
then only 1 guild per server could do it, Id hazard a guess 15 guilds one
each server can do it now.

This was before AA's and SoL, and whilst I don't think your gonna see it
done with any less people now (because that would require a solo kill), more
people can likely repeat it with the same numbers.

I would have no problems attempting to "solo" VSR (using my bots), and I'd
fully expect to win too.
