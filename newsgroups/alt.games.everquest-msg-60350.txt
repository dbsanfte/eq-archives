Hmm, my Human is nowhere near good enough, plus also I'd need an Ogre to
speak it fluently as well. Or maybe spend a few hours learning Ogre - IIRC
language skill increases are capped at one per hour.
I actually made the trip all the way to Ogguk on the off chance but I was
KoS/Dubious in the Shadowknights guild. Was a long return trip for nothing;
but I see that as part of adventuring (My Iksar just loves hunting in
Kunark).

When I looked it up at eq.castersrealm.com it listed Ogguk as being the only
place where it could be bought. Annoyingly, I had the ingredients for
researching it but, whilst the useless spell like Voice Graft combined ok, I
lost them on a failed combine. Spell ingredients tend to drop off mobs 4
levels higher than the spell I think. Certainly all the Words I so far find
are for level 16 spells - I just keep checking all the vendors for the ones
I need and sooner or later I will get lucky - or will find them by /auction
in a city zone.

However one patch day I experimented with a Halfling Rogue on Test - as all
my chars so far have been casters I really enjoyed this one so I duplicated
him on Antonious Bayle. So now if I want to solo I will roleplay my Necro,
when I want to be sociable I will bring out my group-dependant Mob Mincing
Machine (gotta love Dual Wield,Double Attack and Backstab when they all fire
in the same round).

Basically I haven't felt like soloing for a while so my Necro is languishing
at 21 and my Rogue hit 16 last night.
(My 'main' is a level 22 Druid - I started EQ in May and have been a
perma-lowbie - but now I'm sticking to these two)

Cheers
