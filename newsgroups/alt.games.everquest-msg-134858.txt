Not so bad for a druid.  Search the bazaar for what you want.  Look
down.  Track player selling what you want.  Keep looking down and use
tracking to locate them.

That said, I also tried it with all the Luclin models turn off and it
made things MUCH nicer.

Managed to pick up Fixation of Ro and Foliage Shield even.  :-)

Even with the HORRIBLE frame rates, the Bazaar is GREAT for selling.
I felt like a teenage girl trapped in a mall with daddies platinum
card.  :-)
