It strikes me odd that one of the aspects people often uphold in a
roleplaying server is one of racial prejudice.  Dark-elves should never
group with wood-elves.  Trolls should never group with Humans. And so on.
Anyone not of my origin must shunned if not killed.

There is also religious prejudice.  Someone worshiping a good god should
never group with someone who worships an evil god.  Anyone not sharing my
beliefs must be shunned if not killed.

But if you look at a non-RP server, people group with who they are
compatible with without regard to their race or religion.  They seek out
people who are like-minded to pursue common goals without prejudging them.
They only shun people who's actions bother them.

Did we learn nothing from "Shrek?"  Even an Ogre can have a good heart, even
if he does just want to be left alone.

Of course, the real reason it's like that in RP is that it makes it so easy
to see who's "good" and who's "evil".  "There's someone with different color
skin! He's EVIL!!! Kill, Kill, Kill!!!"  No need to waste time trying to get
to know him.
