Hi guys, I play a level 36 shaman on Drinal named Lril. I hope you
guys don't mind me joining this forum, I want to join so I can talk to
other people who play EQ, and to keep updated on things going on in
EQ. Some of my other characters names are Necronomicon (21
necromancer), Boogeman (25 bard)Deathhopper (47 warrior), Jrross (32
rogue) and Livinglegend (level 10 cleric). Just thought I'd introduce
myself. Some of you guys have already seen me on the serverwide chat
channel, but to those that haven't met me: Hi!
