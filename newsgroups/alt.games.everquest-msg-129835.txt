Spotting a promising post, Hawk swoops in on  jennaii@aol.comnojunk
(Jennaii) and hears:

>>The guy who installed my cable and cable modem told me that the signal was

Exactly what Jennaii said, the "booster" is normally called a house
amplifier, the division I work at (Raleigh-Durham, NC) it costs $75,
$50 for the equipment and $25 for the install.  If you buy your own,
any good electronics store, should be able to get it for $50 or less,
and we'll install it for $25 (again, my division, R-D, NC).

Just make sure it boosts the whole signal, as the regular TV service
is at about 3000-3500 MhZ, and you're RR will be more like 7500-8000
MhZ.  Same goes for splitters, allowing the signal thru, as older ones
cut off the signal over about 3500 Mhz, and thus RR or digital cable
if you have it will not work properly.  If you want to make sure you
have good splitters and such, call the TWC office or go to a front
counter, we sell the amps as above (although we only sell an amp with
an install) and you can get splitters just walking into the office.

Also, you can get a "home run" line, which is what Jennaii describes
above, with two lines running into the room.  One will be on the
splitters inside the house, your TV will go to that one, the other one
will be a line straight from the Telecrafter box on the side of your
house into the computer room with no splits on it, your RR goes on
that one to ensure maximum signal.

Anyways, that's the cable modem lesson for the day : )
