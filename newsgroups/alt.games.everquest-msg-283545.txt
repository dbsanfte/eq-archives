good call! do you sit behind me in evidence lectures?

there's a certain poetry to all this, really ...

i started out posting here ("adam diero" and "chris monster" and probably 2 
or 3 other aliases i don't even remember) because i wanted help ... i think 
my most infamous post was back in 2000 or 2001 about how i would dodge in 
and out of melee contact with NPC's on my little ranger and brag that i got 
hit less ... obviously, i had no idea how the mechanics worked, but that's 
just an example ... and now i have a pretty jaded feel for the game (who 
doesnt?) and have probably posted more to help others than to ask for help 
myself

and this crowd has changed a whole lot as well ... but i still feel like the 
old memories, the old secrets, the whole of the obsoleteness of the game - 
now being revived - has a home with this crowd, and if i'm making a home of 
my own, it just feels right to invite this crowd in =)

that's how it goes - but if a lvl 6 is online and asks about the quest in 
the neriak necro guild for the 2-charge bind ring, it might be a lvl 50 or 
another lvl 6 that has the answer... i don't think AGE was ever a place for 
LFG'ing or guild recruiting (at least not first hand), but rather a fun 
forum ... and in coming to life in the game, i would expect that our 
playstyles would mesh a bit but that the forum feel would stay alive

that said, read on...

the 5 of us have a 5-level rule: don't go beyond 5 lvls higher than the 
lowest lvl in our 'fellowship' ... that, of course, is a rule that applies 
only to that 1 group (each of us as a dedicated "5-lvl-rule-toon") ... but 
we might do that with our alts, if they work well, but as the guild grows, 
we're hoping that it just works out

but just among the 5 of us, we have different playtimes and hours, so it's 
likely we'll each be running a host of alts

i know just for the sake of meta-gaming, we have 2 parallel groups already 
set up:

-mage, necro, shaman with a druid/wizard and a bard (and an extra mage or 
necro, likely)
-war, cleric, bard, rogue, wizard, enc/monk

(we kind of want to see how the pet group moves as compared to the "perfect" 
group)

sure, there are always tops and bottoms to the ranges ... we'll just be 
hoping that the lowest don't feel left out and that the highest don't split 
off to reform --and, of course, that the middle can move together through 
the 20's, 30's, and start practicing some raid tactics (remember raiding 
without an epic cleric? weeeee! /gems!) in the 40's

i know for my small group, we have enough disparity in our playtimes that 
we'll be doing sub-groups probably from day 1, so there's no reason anyone 
should feel left out for a while
