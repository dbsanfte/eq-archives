My cleric used to do this regularly; once the mob was well engaged by 
the MA, he'd walk up next to it, swing, sit, wait for mana tic, stand, 
swing, sit, repeat.

Sort of the opposite of the druid plan where you try to guess where the 
tic will be and sit as little as possible; I used a very slow very big 
weapons, so I lost very little swinging, but I was more concerned with 
never missing any mana.

At any rate, my point was, while mobs do indeed hit you for full damage 
if they hit you while you are sitting, if they are hitting something 
else then thats not important.
