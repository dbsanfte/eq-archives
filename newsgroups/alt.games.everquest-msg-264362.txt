You don't know that the "missing pieces" in WoW are going to be "core
pieces". They could end up just being minor "flavor". You're making
assumptions at this point. The game is more polished and in-depth
right NOW than most games are months AFTER release. In it's present
form, it's a product that countless people (either in beta or who did
the stress test) say they're willing to pay for if it released TODAY.

Doesn't sound like anything "core" to the game is missing to me.
Racial traits? Yeah, we know what a "core piece" they are in EQ...
