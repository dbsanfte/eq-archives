My ex-employer had an automated invoicing system:

Vendor wrote his order
Vendor's handheld transformed their format into the open DEX format
Vendor plugged into our system and uploaded invoice
Receiving clerk verified amounts on his handheld
Receiving clerk closes invoice on his handheld
After close of business AP system generates electronic payment of
 invoice amount.

Very nice, very clean - so why did we end up printing 3-4 copies of
EVERY STINKING INVOICE?  I swear we used more paper that way than 
under the old manual receiving system.

BTW - in Portland, at least, there is a non-profit called "Computer Geek".
You bring obsolete comp. equip. to them and they test and build systems
out of them.  In order to qualify for a system you can come in, are taught
how to test components and build systems - then you build X systems for
others and you get yours for free.  Yes, you aren't playing the latest
games on them, but this gets computers into the hands of folks who 
might otherwise be left behind.  Additionally, they dispose of all
irrepairable equipment properly.

They get anything that I can't see any further use for.  (I'm an awful
packrat, and I end up with a lot of obsolete stuff sitting around because
"I might find a use for that!")
