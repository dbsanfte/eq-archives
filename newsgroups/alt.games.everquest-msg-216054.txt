Which is why you're not a warrior.   Unstunnable from the front is huge.
For a warrior, "a few seconds of your DPS" is all you're able to use to
maintain aggro.  And raid level mobs stun you a *lot*.

Even if you are a raider... you don't generally go from "newbie without
guild" to "raiding guild" and instantly are handed 150 stamina worth of
gear.  Gaining that gear is the result of months and months of post 65
raiding, even in the most uber guilds.

Hell, you're unlikely to even get into said guilds these days, unless you're
level 65 with 50 - 100 AA and several flags.
