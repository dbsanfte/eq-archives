Removing the straps limiting you to 33.6 will not help the original poster,
he is using two modems and 'multilink' software.  I would be curious to know
if anyone else is successfully using the same configuration for playing EQ,
or any online game.

By the way, 56K connections perform rate shifts, rate renegotiations, and
retrains all the time on some lines (many line-types actually).  Keeping
your modem strapped down to V.34 speeds will definitely give you a much more
stable and consistent connection.
