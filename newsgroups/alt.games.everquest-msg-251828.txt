Ok, so I'm on FV and only have one char per account. I'm feeling the
need for another class to help me out (a chanter to level up to summon
vials of mana, etc.. for purposes of tradeskilling) or simply go the
whole way and 2-Box a Warrior to compliment my Shaman for soloing.

What I need to know is the little details.

Can I simply double click on my EQ icon and a second instance opens up
and I log in with the alternate username and password?

Do I need to install another copy of EQ?

I used to have another account with them, can't remember the password.
I suppose I could call up and get it reactivated.
