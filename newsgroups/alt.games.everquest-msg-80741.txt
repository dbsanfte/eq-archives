My guild recently had a raid in The Hole,(my first time there) where I
looted a couple of unusual items.  I've searched a few of the usual
websites and haven't been able to find out what they are for.  I was
hoping that someone here might have any knowledge of these items:
1. Living Heart of a Brell Minion (lore)
2,Holy Dirt of Brell (no-drop)

Note that since I was the only cleric of Brell on the raid, I was
given the honor of looting the items.  (no one on the raid or in my
guild has any clue what they are for).  Since the Living Heart isn't
no-drop, I suppose it's possible that it's just vendor trash (with my
awesome 45 points of cha, I could sell it for 6 gold I think== dont'
remember for sure).  I also suppose it's possible that the dirt is for
a quest that either has not been implemented yet, or has not be found
or solved yet.
