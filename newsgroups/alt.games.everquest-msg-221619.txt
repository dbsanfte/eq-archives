Okay, goodbye, /i

Routinely, I would set out adventuring with my old guild (guild
groups), with two necros, a SK, one or two casters (wiz/mage/enc), and
a rogue. The guild was evil ONLY, no goodies, so no Druids, Rangers,
and Troll or Ogre SHA.

We had no probs, the only one who needed heals were rogue and casters,
and they were not supposed to get hit. We had Clerics, but scarce.
