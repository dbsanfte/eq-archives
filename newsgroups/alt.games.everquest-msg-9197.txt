Most any kind in Kunark.  If they give a LegionOfCabilis
faction raise, they'll do.  A lot of them were the newbie
goblins around the Cabilis outpost in Warslik's Woods, those
can be mowed down like wheat in a thresher.  And a lot of
the other ones were the goblins in the Goblin fort in the
northern end of WW.  I cleared the fort many times hunting
for Grachnist (eventually got his Totem of the Warrior Spirit,
woo hoo).

And all goblins of any level apparently gave the same
size of faction hit (1.0), since my Trooper faction maxed out
after exactly 2000 goblins/sarnaks/bone-chip-quests combined.

Yup, I was there for about two weeks solid (but not all at
one stretch).

When I write up the details of my adventure, I'll give complete
guides to these things, but in short it's best to leap into the
NE corner of the "pond" in East Cabilis shortly after zoning in,
and then swim over to the bank.

Trying to go south along the east wall of Cabilis (via any path)
gets the Furscales boiling out of their house after you (they're
on shaman faction).

Going west along the north wall is ok if you hug the "pond" and
don't get too close to the shaman's guild that you'll be passing by,
but when you turn the corner and start heading south to the bank,
you can get jumped by "Grype", an NPC who is sometimes upstairs in
the building with the brew barrel (he's on necro faction).
One of these days I'll try sneaking along BEHIND the building he's
in to see if that gives enough distance to escape his aggro range,
but it's going to be a tight squeeze.

So there's really no safe way to simply walk from the FoB entrance
to the bank, without hopping into the water and bypassing the two
danger points that way.  Coming back is a reverse of the above,
except for the tricky part being that there's no ladder where you
need to get out of the pond.  But with a good swimming skill it's
possible to leap up and out of the pond like a dolphin leaping for
a fish on a pole, even without a ladder.

But other than those two spots, I'm golden all over East Cabilis,
and ok most places in West Cabilis except for the Necro guild itself,
and the "Hermit" alcove near the LOIO zone point.  But both can be
walked around quite easily.
