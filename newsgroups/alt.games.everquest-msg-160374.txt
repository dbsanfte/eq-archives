I setup the Trilogy (stripped down) on my old laptop (P2-366 384MB RAM 8MB
Video) and it runs, but very crapily.  My biggest gripe would be ultra low
FPS on the video and choppiness of the whole thing.  Don't know if you'd see
much better from that desktop PC.

FYI, i just used the latop to setp up a mule while i was playing on my other
account.
