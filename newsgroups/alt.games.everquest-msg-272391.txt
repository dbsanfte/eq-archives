Yeah? Well you are not worthy of EverQuest that's all. Oh, and can I 
have yer stuff? LOL!!

I'm sorry! Just kidding! Just kidding! Although I have met some people 
who were not very nice and I do not have experience in any other MMORPGs 
except for Asheron's Call, EverQuest has not seemed a bad place to me 
overall.

I have been playing for a year so far and in that time have put 3 people 
on my ignore list. That's not too bad considering how many nice people 
I've met and enjoyed playing with.

I don't know how to address your generalization the EverQuest people are 
somehow more unfriendly in general than people are in other games of 
this kind. Honestly, I find that kind of hard to believe. It's just a 
game full of people like the many others you listed above. How likely is 
it that any one game would somehow have a disproportionate number of 
difficult people vs. the world at large? I guess maybe a game that was 
all PvP might. I don't know that but maybe.
