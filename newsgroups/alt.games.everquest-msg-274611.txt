At least clever is something that can be attached to the things I do, which
is quite unlike your entire life history.

Neither can you. Fortunately for us, that isn't important. The original
poster DID have context, and from that context, only you have had trouble
understanding why there was a problem. Ever stopped to consider that when
the rest of the world disagrees with you, that you might be wrong? No, of
course not. Keep on howling at the moon baby!

More proof that you are an idiot. I know, I know...hugely redundant, but
still fun.

I see no need to repost a dozen links that other people have provided just
because you lack the intellectual honesty to acknowledge them yourself.
You'd just ignore what I said too, so what's the point?
