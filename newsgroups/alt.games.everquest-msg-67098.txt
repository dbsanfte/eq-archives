That must be the part I was thinking of Jazz, Thank you!  I don't play a
Warrior...  I have a friend who does and we were discussing Epic quests and
he said the last he had heard, the Warrior Epic was broken and had been for
forever...  I'll let him know it's been fixed for sometime.  He had said
something about an NPC that didn't do anything when you hailed it or
something.

Thanks again!  :o)
