Ok, hide is just not reliable enough, imho, to use to break charm for
a bard. At best, I think I see 1 in 3 attempts work.  Even worse is
that when I press hide, I'm really not sure it's going to work, and am
usually surprised when it does actually work, and I get bonked by my
former pet.

So, with the 39 charm, the trick is to switch instruments to your
flute, and start singing invis when your mob gets within 10 seconds of
death.  Sometimes that's hard to gauge (depends on how many mobs are
beating on your pet), so I usually try to error on the side of being
conservative and break the song earlier.

So start or continue running circles around the pet, sing invis, and
as soon as charm breaks, switch back to drum and begin chant kiting
the pet down.

Works for 100% of the time me when I have everything set up right :)
When I don't, and forget to get everything arranged just right, it can
be very clumsy.  So my first pull of the session of swarm kiting is
very conservative... like maybe 3 mobs max, so that I can flush out
the problems in my setup.
