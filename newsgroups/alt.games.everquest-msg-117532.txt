Im against ebaying chars as much as anybody else here,  but boy do some
people make this too much of a BFD.

Somebody buying EQ and then not liking the game, decides to sell their
software and whatever newbie chars are on the account is NOTHING like
selling your 50+ char for $500

I mean god damn, its likely they won't even know the characters exist,
unless out of pure luck they pick the right server (from a *long* list)
