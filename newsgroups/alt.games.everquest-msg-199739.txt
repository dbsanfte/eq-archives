as for hands,  id say impskin gloves they go for usually under 1k.

back i would say Loam encrusted  should be 500p or less.  gives ya 3cha 1int
and a few stats.

neck i would look for a sarnak arcane fetish,  give ya nice int and charisma
.

you can make yourself  some  +charisma  rings too ,

you should be able to get a braided cinch cord  for yer waist   that has
+5int  fairly cheap.

  i suggest alsoowing out the shissar  dagger and getting an opal encrusted
stein that has +25charisma on it they go for around 20plat

 for a face slot you can either quest ,  or  buy an incandescent mask ,
again a VERY nice item  for an enchanter

for head you should be able to get a runed cowl  or nightshade wreath
inexpensivly

if youcan only upgrade 1 item 1st i suggest the sarnak arcane fetish  with
6int and 5cha IIRC


focus items dont make or break you.  so dont  kill yourself over them. i
played my ench to 57 and only focus effect i  had  was the one on sarnak
fetish.
