can someone explain what's going on?

first off, thistlecoat, according to lucy, has no regen (looking on the test
version of spells)

it never did ......doesn't now

why, assuming i've botched something, would a spell with 5 regen (uppped
from 3) make its user a "powerhouse" ?

if graeme's original post were sarcastic, why would there be two serious
responses?

am i missing something dreadful? =/
