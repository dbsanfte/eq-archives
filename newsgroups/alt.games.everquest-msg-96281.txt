When my chars travel from Firiona Vie to Lake of Ill Omen:

Druid: SoWed and Greater Camoed (Which some of the spiders can see through.)

Bard: Will be playing the Clouding song (Which some of the spiders can see
through.)

They will run along the stream (While I, hold my breath.), dodging spiders
as best they can.

How do you run to LOIO from FV?

Is there a better (safer) method of traveling between these zones?

Is there some place high enough a druid, with levitate, can begin running
that allows them to run over those spiders?
