They can drop off any of the magicians in Najena .... I'd had earth, air and
fire for ages and ended up running around the zone trying to get the water
page killing them all with the 49 earth pet. I'd do the mages on the main
lvl after the terrors and in the crystal room then head downstairs to the
jail after there I'd go and bop the goblins and do the 2 in najena's room
and finally head over to where trazdon spawns as his ph is a DE mage and
there's another DE mage on the ramp below him.

Trying to get power of fire to drop off blazing elementals now and it looks
like it's gonna be a loooonng camp :( ... I've read that the lava elementals
drop it more often but the ph is a clockwork ... but as a gnome mage it's
not good for me to start killing them.
