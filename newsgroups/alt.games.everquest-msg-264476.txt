Yes, that took a bit of getting used to.  Took me a few levels to realize 
why I wasn't seeing messages such as "You have become better at dodge". 
There certainly appears to be no skill increase for just practicing a skill, 
you get ALL of your current skills increased on level up.  Not sure I like 
this part much.

I could have sworn I saw an SOE post indicating that you would get skill 
increases for actually using your skills in EQ2.  So I'm not sure if this is 
just one of those items that they haven't actually 'plugged' in to the game 
yet or not.  (I hope that's the case).
