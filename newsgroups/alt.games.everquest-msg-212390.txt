In the newsgroups I some times see posts referring to a "Troll-Meter" and
"He is a Troll." Heck I once was called a Troll. I suspect it is a term used
to label someone in an un-kindly way.
Heck I might be doing something right now that would be considered Troll.
Unfortunately I have no idea as to what constitutes being a Troll. I am sure
there are others on our news group who are in the dark as well.

Thanks
