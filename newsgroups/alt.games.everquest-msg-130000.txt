It's just *you* deciding that what the Israelis do is not "terrorism",
therefore they get the moral high ground.

not one of them supports a peaceful solution.  Yet all the Israelis

The Israelis doing the killings of Palestinians are enrolled, paid
soldiers in the Israeli army.  I'd imagine quite a lot of Army mothers
are proud of their sons, just like in the US and Britain.
