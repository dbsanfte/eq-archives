Different guilds have different rules for enrolment the (sometimes) lamer
guilds tend to lose that many members they are constantly inviting anyone
who shows a interest while the (sometimes) better guilds will expect you to
jump through hoops ie. register at a website, group with some members,
become a member of a feeder guild etc. before they will invite you and even
then will not allow you to get any good loots from raids until you have
earned so many raid points.
Your best bet is to look for a guild you find interesting and send a polite
tell to any one of the members asking if they have time to chat about their
guild and find out from them (remember they will be biased).
