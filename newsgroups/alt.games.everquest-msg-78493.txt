I've noticed that if ya wanna go and  med up and not be bothered is to sit
on one of the pillars and sit on the side facing the ocean.  heheh I've doen
that many a time whenI was hunting in Oasis and wanted to keep my pet medded
up and healed up and went AFK so I could go catch a couple hours of shut eye
in the process. Wonderful thing about that  is I could do so undisturbed and
not worry about being aggroed by anything.
