Perhaps it's one of those things that some people can learn to do, and
others can't.  I have no trouble reading the subtitles and following the
movie.  Like TH, I don't even notice that I am reading the subtitles, and I
very much agree with him that hearing the original voices with the
intonations makes a big difference.  I have seen some dubbed movies that
were well done, but most of them have been badly dubbed.  I used to watch
quite a few foreign films, and always opted for the subtitled when it was
available.
