Technically Sony could solve it by handing out uber gear to all players, 
levelling the playing field. We agree this would be a bad idea if it 
were done just like that. However there are some compromises, like raid 
gear with +raid stats that could serve to level out the 1-group game 
while still differentiating what a raider can do vs what a 1-grouper can 
do.

By 1/5th your gear, I'd have thought it clear that I mean gear that is 
1/5th as good as yours in terms of an abstract level appropriate sliding 
scale. Not in terms of absolute stats.

Suppose you pulled a stupid and destroyed your breastplate, and then 
spent the last year at level 65 playing 8 hours a day and ended up with 
an AC 150BP, it should be obvious that another player who did the same 
thing but only playing once a week is going to have better than an AC30 
BP (1/5th your play time) at the end of it.

When comparing gear you have to set a reasonable baseline using marginal 
gear. At 70th level you can trivially obtain a breastplate with AC50+ in 
a few hours, probably you can do better. In otherwords, the most gimped 
of all 70th level players with no time investment at all whatsoever, 
should have at the very least an AC50 bp.

You need to look at the distance between the baseline and what you have, 
not from naked to what you have, because NOBODY, not even the gimpiest 
gimp plays naked. 4/5ths of the distance from a reasonable baseline to 
your gear will be (And should be) more than simply 4/5ths your stats.

Further the weighting and relevancy of the stats should be incorporated. 
HP (for a tank) should be weighted higher than int. Focus effects that 
make healing spells 10% more efficient are worth far more than +100 
mana.

I think claiming there is no solution is a weak substitute for actually 
looking for one. I agree that its not a mechanics failure of the game, 
but that doesn't mean its not a failure that can't be resolved or 
compensated for.

EQ raiding is essentially a team sport like hockey. People who can't 
show up regularly for games and practices can't play. EQ 1-group is more 
like drop-in games. In hockey, you can 'handicap' the pro-players to 
level the playing field for these games to make it fun for everyone.

Golf works the same way. In fact most sports that have situations that 
mix pro and amateur players have found solutions to level the playing 
field.

No reason EQ can't.

Good point. Your right, I hadn't factored the soft caps in. That -does- 
change the diminishing returns evaluation somewhat. As things like 
deltaAC and so on get weighed downwards. Although the exemptions of 
mana/hp, and nature of the procs/clickies/foci are still very important, 
and are indeed key defining differences between much of the 'good gear' 
from its '1-group counterpart'.
