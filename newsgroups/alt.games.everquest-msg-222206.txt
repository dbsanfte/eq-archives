No. Its not painted on the walls. Or baybe it is....

'Follows the rules he's set for himself' leaves morality in the hands of 
the individual. Clearly then morality is arbirary and meaningless. I do 
not agree. There are better models.

Christianties' maxim "Do unto other others as you would have them do 
unto you" is actually a beautiful axiom of morality. Kant rephrased it 
thus, and crystalizes the concept:

"Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will 
that it should become a universal law."

Consider that this dictates a morality that very closely matches 
traditional morality, without requiring explicit divine commandment, 
without making morality arbitrary, and without imparting any moral 
judgement of its own.

It allows us to be self interested, and come up with altruistic values. 
Because ultimately its in our best interests to for society to have 
these values.

Another theory, the 'social contract' also explicity relies purely on 
self-interest in society to generate morals. Its similiar to the above, 
but has weaknesses because society is ill-defined, and it breaks down in 
inter-societal interation/contexts.

I suppose. I could make a case that its immoral to be disrepespectful.

I disagree.

First, Rewarding service with a gratuity isn't a 'moral issue'.

And second, prostitution is a tricky moral issue. Even if we set aside 
moral issues regarding infidelity, lust, and ignore any social mores on 
the 'sanctity of sex' which are grounded in both religious tradition and 
biological factors.

That still leaves us with a situation where for it to be moral it still 
presupposes the whore is there by willing deliberate informed choice not 
unfortunate circumstance; prostitution in theory can be moral (with some 
higher class 'escort services' for example)... but in practice on the 
street (where your dirty low down sonofabitch is likely shopping) it is 
more like drug dependance and violence enforced slavery... and 
perpetrating the situation by patronizing the service is immoral.
