Thanks to all who submitted questions for the Q&A. As soon as the
answers are in from the producers, we'll make them available.

In the meantime, please see below for some exclusive screenshots from
POP.  If you'd like to use them on your site, or would like higher
resolution please let me know.  It would also be terrific if you could
link to them.  Please let me know if you use them so I can take a
peek!

Also-- as an early warning- we'll be launching a PoP contest in the
next few days.   Details as we get a little closer.


Exclusive!
