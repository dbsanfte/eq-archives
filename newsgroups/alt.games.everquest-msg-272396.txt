I don't think we are talking about changing the rules of the game per 
se. We are in this case talking about extending the game to accomodate a 
substantial number of customers who would like to see solo play exist in 
the game.

The fact that WoW and some other games to varying degrees allow for this 
says to me there is no reason it cannot be done with no ill effects to 
those who strictly prefer group play.

I guess one could argue for the idea of a grouping only MMO and insist 
that those who don't want to group play some other game. And of course 
SOE can do that with EverQuest II. But from a business standpoint that 
does not seem wise to me as it will result in less subscriptions and 
therfore less profit.

I thought I had read somewhere that SOE has heard from enough players 
who want solo capability to exist in the game that are planning to 
introduce some changes in the future to facilitate this. Is there 
anything to that? Has anyone else read similar information? I wish I 
could remember where I saw that as I'd include a link.
