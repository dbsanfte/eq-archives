I admit it.  I am surprised.  First I get the downloading eqgame.exe notice,
then can't log in.  Checked the website and saw the "scheduled" patch
message (posted at 1627 PST).

What are they thinking?  Don't they realize that I have no life and want to
play on my day off?  Shouldn't they have consulted me about this?  I would
have told them that this was a bad idea.  Well, I'm going to play DAoC, now.
Verant really screwed this one up.  I'm never coming back (not until the
patch is over, anyway).

It actually does surprise me that on one of the 3 days in America that all
the shops are closed (except 7-11), the Powers That Be scheduled a patch.
