TSR et al have  said they have it trademarked...and indeed there
specific expression undoubtedly is trademarked. There are a number of
variations and additions from the old folklore, specific skills and
powers, a specific look etc all derived from older myth or for a lot of
the D&D drow simply added and expanding on the original concept. They can
protect all of that thats in their expression by trademark quite
happily. 

If you look up folklore stuff then you can see where the idea came from
originally.....it is obscure, I remember taking a long time finding
references, and I honestly cant remember where I got the reference from
originally. I better go and try and find it again.....

This was gone through on a D&D newsgroup ages ago (probably has recurred
several times since) and thats where I dug out the folklore reference for.
