The only time there will be a problem is when theres a dispute over
the account. As long as SOE is getting paid, they dont care
(unoficially of course - officially they *can* ban or suspend accounts
as per the EULA). The only other issue is when trying to move
characters to different accounts. IF the OP later creates an account
of his/her own and wants to move a character from the old account to
the new one, it will be refused.
