There are quite a few newbie zones already, at least for values of
newbie where you're above level 6 - in Qeynos, you have Oakmyst
Forest, The Caves, The Down Below, The Peat Bog, The Forest Ruins, and
Antonica, plus the city itself (lots of fedex quests that give good
exp and coin).  Those zones can probably support a few hundred newbies
(without instancing), which of course won't be enough at release when
the hordes storm the servers.

The problem with Antonica isn't room, they could easily support more
than the 300 characters that is the limit is now, but that the server
it runs on can't handle the load.  It sounds like they're expecting to
be able to increase that, though, hopefully it will be high enough not
to be a real issue.
