Or to have people sensible enough not to engage unslowed mobs.  Root, 
mez, stun, heck, just running mobs in a circle, anything as long as you 
don't insist on accepting damage from the mob till its slowed.

This is a matter of definitions.  If your group is entirely self buffed, 
then rezzed deaths are no more than a hiccup in the flow of experience; 
the question is whether everyone is netting positive experience per 
hour, not whether there are zero deaths.  Some play as though death was 
somehow the worst thing that can happen in the game; but if the bodies 
are easily recovered and rezed,  death may be no more than a mild 
inconvenience.  Having a 65 cleric alt  logged out right there ready to 
go make risks a lot more acceptable.

That said, I certainly wasn't seeing a death every half hour, and I 
can't think of a single one that was due to a bad run of slow resists; 
look at my description of the requirements, -one- mob and a tank who can 
hold aggro even with stocism running.  Deaths were due to overpulls that 
didnt' get controlled, to aggro trouble, or in a few cases to people 
insisting on meleeing unslowed mobs; you could argue that that last is a 
result of slow resists, but I say it isn't; they were clearly  advised 
not to try that, to wait for the "slowed" message.  And since in raid 
situations, the ability to follow simple instructions as to when to 
engage is critical, I put it to you that this is an excellent learning 
experience for the tanks that couldn't maintain a "look but don't touch" 
policy on demand.

To me, outclassed is when you can only kill every second mob, when your 
exp bar moves slower than it would in whatever zone you just "outgrew", 
when you flee to zone more than once after working out your best strategy.

Its not "gee, these mobs are tough, lets go to crushbone I hear we can 
make a fortune selling CB belts."
