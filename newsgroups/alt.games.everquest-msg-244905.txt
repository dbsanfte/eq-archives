That was true for most single-group content.  Not in raids unless they
had been trivialized by gear.

It fixed mid-level Warriors.  Highend Warriors were already ok via
+hate procs.  The big huge balance stink arose because SOE's attempted
"fix" to Warrior woes (+hate proc'ing weapons and augments) had not
helped much outside the highend.

Knights get aggro just fine, although highend Warriors now exceed their
aggro capabilities by a significant margin vs. single targets.  The
problem is that GoD carried on the PoP/LDoN-hard path of making shorter
nastier fights.  In PoP this meant you needed to land a slow fast.  In
GoD it means that if you're not disc'd you're dead.

> Whats changed since then, from a knights point of view?

You can't tank if you can't live.  It's exceedingly difficult to cast
spells when you are getting hit hard and fast.  It's impossible to
cast spells if you are a corpse.  Stuns have little value against
stun-immune mobs (aside from aggro).  A 1k heal is pretty pointless
when the mob is averaging 2k DPS.  Trying to heal yourself, even if
it works and happens to make a difference in your survival, ends up
losing aggro (your healers are spamming fast heals, CH is simply not
useful in some of these fights) and wiping your group anyway.  It
takes two Clerics (or a Cleric and a Druid) to keep a defensive
Warrior alive through some of these forced (as in instanced)
single-group fights.  Rangers are better tanks than Paladins and
Shadowknights because they can Weaponshield (for a whole 12 seconds,
think about that).

Warrior +hate capabilities cannot fizzle or be interrupted.  Unlinked
dics allow them to chain Furious to Defensive vs. nameds.  Warriors
have substantial frontal melee stun resistance (via AAs) even if they
are not Ogres.  Warriors have an extra 500hp via GoD AAs.

The worst of this is in forced single group content, but Knights are
also incapable of tanking many raid adds, and can't stun for fear of
drawing aggro, and can't heal for fear of drawing aggro (in Uqua
every PC death results in mobs spawning).
