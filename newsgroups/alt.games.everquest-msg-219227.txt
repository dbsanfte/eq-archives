The monster summoning line is primarily for fun -
focus items don't focus them, the MSIII pet never
got upgraded when the GV pets did and the fact that
MSII comes a short level before Voc earth gives it
a limited usefulness.

However - MS pets have earth hp and don't cast.  This
results in higher DPS (mage pets cast, bl/nec pets
proc) when the spell is either non damaging (earth) or
doesn't hit what you're fighting.

Also, you used to be able to get a MS pet that would
DS itself - essentially giving you a earthpet with a
firepet ds and max melee dps.

So, MSI 34-38 if you don't have your stein, MSII for pet
canni (no different than 49 earth though) and MSIII is
completely useless.

There's a reason mages are still bitter about our velious
spells - a useless line of MS pets, and the incredibly 
poorly thought out dots (worse damage/mana ratios than 
our nukes) and no improved invis, which every other int
caster got.
