There is a good way to raise it. While killing bandits and such kill
gnolls for teeth sometimes. When you turn in gnoll teeth to the
captain in qeynos, you get a moonstone. Mneal jacob, or whatever,
gives a quest/faction for the moonstones. You raise karana residents
as part of it.

A lucky thing is there are usually many player sold moonstones on
vendors. My dark elf bought over 26, got a bunch herself for gnoll
teeth and finally got non kos to the millers/karana residents.
