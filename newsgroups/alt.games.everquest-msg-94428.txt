    Keep one of each on you. Pop the CT potion to escape danger - that area
of the maze is apparently free of wanderers and statics now. Then, use the
Thurg one to get to a safe place.

    GMs are apparently chaging the zone back and forth from one config to
another to help get people out that did exactly what you did. And as for
camping where you were, near the AoF room, you'd have LOVED it now. Yes,
that's right - the AoF room is now the site of
yet-another-Ring-of-Fire-event (TM). Because real boss mobs don't waste
enough time!
