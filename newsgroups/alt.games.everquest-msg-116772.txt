I have no idea what level you are but at level 60 I'm horribly
scrabbling for mana (not to mention spell slots) most of the time.  If
I have KEI then this lets me hit Calefaction as soon as it refreshes,
heal my own AoE and riposte damage, cast assorted buffs on others as
well as Snare, break Mez with Root etc.  If I don't have at least
Clarity *and* I'm expected to pull then I'll need to sit down at least
once every 20 minutes or so.

Interestingly I was grouped in Cazic with one of our small race (so
high Int, large mana pool) Grave Lords and he was struggling to have
enough mana to keep aggro as he was chain casting debuffs and 'taps to
keep mobs on him, in this case his large mana pool didn't really help
as we had minimal downtime so mana regen was the limiting factor.
