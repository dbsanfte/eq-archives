My bard and my wife's ranger have been hunting recently in Dalnir's and
in FM.

When we fight bonecharmer goblins or coerced iksar, they seem to have
a damage shield that gives this message "YOU are tormented!"  and then
we lose about 50 hit points or so.

What is this?  The ranger tried casting "Dispell magic" on one and it seemed
to work, but it didn't on another.  She even cast it twice, landing it both times,
but we still were tormented.  Net result was that we still killed the mob, but
lost a lot of HPs to a blue-to-us mob.  Nasty little buggers, these.

I'm starting to think that maybe they have some magical armor or something that
does this, and it can't be dispelled.

It may be time to do some chant kiting <eg>
