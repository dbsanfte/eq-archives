ahahahha he's 30 and he owned you in the face

anyway, more along the lines of what i imagine you'd want to know, based on
your post, i think i can provide some help-

enchanters DO stack; you just need the insight to see what you can do best

(these are all suggestions based on many different zones and situations; you
can never do ALL of these things)

tash the other enchanter's mobs

refresh mez (say you're doing it if you use a spell that gives them the
'worn off' message)

use your slow on mobs that are resistant, even if soemone else is casting
slow

i guess you can nuke? i'll laugh if you say that's what you do, but it's
possible =p (don't laugh about dots though)

charming is a great way to contribute if crowd control is elementary

you can cast aggro buffs and un-aggro buffs (the visage line) .. i rarely
find anyone doing that, even when i'm with 4 or 5 other chantys

if you know what you're doing, you can pull

you can aoe stun . . there's never enough aoe stun

you can help pullers with the lull line, making it cake (making the other
enc's bored too)

you can cast debuffs. . .  enc's get soem debuffs no one else gets, yet in a
nickel 'n' dime situation, those stat debuffs help

MAKE JOKES

turn your group mates into humans, then make you can cast UV on everyone

practice your jewel crafting . .. (i *am* joking about this one)

cast rune spells

stand near your fellow enchanters so you can target their resisted mobs
faster



most importantly . .TALK with your other enchanters and see who is
using/doing/wanting/afraid of what
