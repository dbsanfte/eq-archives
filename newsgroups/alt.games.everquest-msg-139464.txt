Nonono, we are discussing having a porter in your group.  He's
in your group already.  You don't wait for a port, not xxxx time,
not even xxx or xx or even x time.  Now.  How long does it
take to mem?  point 000000x time.  Porter  good.  /auction WTB
port bad.

At 55?  FIFTY FIVE?  Boggle.  Shake head.  Try to imagine living
to 55 at strolling speed.  Try to imagine living to 40 at strolling speed.
Try to calculate just how far my EQ disc would fly if used as a frisbie
after the frustration of living to 50 at strolling speed.

OK, (puts the whole thing out of his head) If you are running a long
distance, SOW versus TBoots -is- an issue.  TBoots are as
fast as a level 9 shaman SOW.  A SOW from a 55ish druid is
vastly faster.  Make that a 55ish shaman, since the druid could
have just ported you and made things much faster still.

While the lack of nexus might have made your plan slightly more
understandable back in the dark ages, it doesn't apply to the
current situation, which is what we are discussing now.

Getting a REAL group and doing seb, HS, chardok, Velks, SG... heck,
SF even would probably be better than a clumsily built pickup group
in seb, judging from the only similar zone in Morell Thule, which is KC.  You
just don't get a well balanced group in that environment very often, you
gimp along on substandard group construction while conducting bidding
wars for the missing elements.  Compare a ranger/ranger/monk/druid/cleric/cleric

group to a chanter/cleric/warrior/druid/monk/rogue group.  If the first
group is filled with good players, they can certainly do all right.. but the
second group can do more at lower levels safer, faster, and with less fuss.

No, its not terrible really.  And there IS an arguement for finding something
that works and sticking to it.  I know I got a lot of my exp soloing in
CS, not because it was efficient (cleric, solo, in a no bonus zone... I
hardly think you can call that efficient) but because I was able to do
so with no wait for group to form up, move around, get into position...
Log on, kill, med, kill, med.  If I wanted to group, I'd LFG on but that
wouldn't cost me any solo time.

What would have worked in a similar vein would be for your monk
to find a spot where he could solo, but reasonably near a port, and
LFG for groups with porters.  If you don't group with porters, then
for this plan to work you need a solo spot near a group spot

Again, no, paying for a port is a rich mans way of denying wizards and
druids the fun of grouping.  Don't pay for ports, group with porters,
and then make a point of using the porting ability just as they make
use of your FD and massive damage output.

I'll grant you there is something to the "work constantly" plan that offsets
the sub-optimal nature of what you are doing.  Especially if you are
on in short chunks, form up time DOES eat into your exp production.

On the other hand, what a boring, driven way to play.  Go to an exp
zone, stay there till its no longer good exp, move to the next.  You see
what, a tenth of what the game has to offer?  And you end up poor
as a churchmouse, because the best exp tends not to be at loot zones,
and much of the loot is lore anyway, so you can't pack much of it
out with you... if you were bothering to do so at all.  Over the lower
levels, your refusal to deal with the "petty cash" loot splits means
you throw away most of the capital gains without even realizing it,
then you whine about not having 100pp to your name while level
55 to 60.  Well of course not, you weren't doing loot splitting
properly... which is back to my original thesis!

Seb is the worst example here, since there is actual loot to be
had, some of it lucrative but lightweight and Stackable.  If as
a monk you arrange to have your share of all loot paid in gems,
you can reasonably expect to not have to leave before you've
got over 100Kpp on you!
