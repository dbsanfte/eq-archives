Tonight I twice saw a message that I'm sure I've never seen before.
My monk had feigned death, and after a while I was told, "Your enemies
have forgotten you!"  Has anyone else seen this, and do you know what
it means?  Sure, I know FD tends to make mobs forget me, but at my
level (mid-twenties) the effect seems pretty reliable, i.e. I can
stand up even if I haven't been told they've forgotten me, and they
don't come charging back for me.  So just what is it that's different
when I do get the message?

In each of the two cases, the "forgotten you" message was almost
exactly 2 minutes after the feign, but with only two samples I can't
be sure that the timing is consistent.
