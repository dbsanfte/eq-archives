Since the drained effect only seems to happen on light and minor
healing [& healing] why should it really matter.  As you said you
suspected that you would have gotten the same heal back as if
you did not have the Healing item, so getting a 20% boost every
now and then is still great.
Who knows why the programmers put it in, but does it really effect
the way you play your game?

ps. Looking through my old message about it looks as if it will
drain for 'healing' as well.  Greater healing and Superior seem
to have grown out of the phase of needing to feed the focus
items.
