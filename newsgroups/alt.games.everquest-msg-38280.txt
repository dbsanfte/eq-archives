Within 60 seconds of saying hi to my guild, or within 5 minutes of
logging in, I get requests to join groups or to partner with friends.
It is often hard to do anything *I* want to do, because there's always
someone who wants my help.

For the past week I haven't had anything I've wanted to do, so I've
done nothing but socialize: I've helped guild mates track mobs and
complete quests, I've ported people all over Norrath, I even joined in
a Corruptor raid and got stomped by a Reaver.

My xp bar is irrelevant. I have no pressing need to gain a level; in
fact I'm dreading level 36 (31 was a "hell" level for me, far more so
than 30).

I don't especially want to take a break. I guess I just want to
rediscover the fun of the game.
