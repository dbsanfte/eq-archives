I don't understand.  Are you saying Gore will agro from a long way
away?  Like if you are standing at Karnor's, she will agro?  Gore
wanders around in the snowy area.  She will agro if she sees you, and
she does have a pretty big frenzy range, but you can get close enough
to take a look and not get agro.  You can even hunt in the snowy area
as long as you don't go too far east, as far as I know.
