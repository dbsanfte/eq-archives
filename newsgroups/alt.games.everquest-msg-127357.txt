}Procs can add several hundred damage to each fight.  Aside from that, it's the
}only proven (useful) effect of higher dexterity.

Some procs can also do useful and clever things like slow (in case you 
have no shaman/enchanter) or snare (druid, wizard) or clockwork poison 
(ok, I just think that one's -cool-. :) Plus, I lucked into the weapon for 
my 18 Rogue... only 32 more levels til it starts procing! )

}> Dex = Ranged... IE Thrown (a Rogues only chance to CRIT) weapons.
}Woo...  and exactly how much damage do those throws do?    Ever wonder why you
}don't see Rogues doing the same kind of bow kiting that Rangers sometimes do?
}Ever see a rogue stop in the middle of combat, back up and start throwing
}daggers while the mob is being tanked?  No?  Ever wonder why?

Well, actually, I've seen that.  A good friend of mine is a 56 rogue... 
When she was 52ish, she started throwing stuff a lot, and it'd go crit! 
crit! crit! And I'd go "ooh, neat!".  then a week or two later she stopped 
doing it, and I asked her why.  "Because it's stupid." "Oh."


}> Stamina items aren't hard to come by... it's just that STA is never the
}> primary stat of the items people sell in EC/Gfay.
}If you say so....

Well, Crusty is god for Sta.  Can Rogues wear that?  In general, I agree, 
good Sta stuff is hard to get.  Well, Sta stuff where you're not giving up 
having something really good in that slot to wear it.  Like AC/HP or 
something.
