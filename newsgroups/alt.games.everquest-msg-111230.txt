Taking the advice of several members of this froup, I decided to give FG a 
second chance.  I popped in there early Sunday morning, saw a couple 
guildies in the zone, so sent them a tell.  They were grouped with 3 folks 
from other guilds, but all 55+ and folks I've grouped with in the past.  
We were a pretty balanced group, warrior, rogue, bard, shaman, mage, 
cleric, and were easily able to keep 3 shroom patches cleared, along with 
pulling any blue or light-blue bug that wandered within range.
After an hour or so, other folks moved in, and the shrooms were not nearly 
as numerous, so we started discussing moving to the bandit camps.  I had 
done the bandits one time previously, and hadn't found them difficult, so 
I was quite suprised when everyone else in the group was apprehensive 
about trying bandits.  I was even more suprised since I've done quite a 
bit of duoing and grouping with the mage, and he knows that with the 
cleric the three of us could probably do the bandits.  We discussed it for 
a while, and decided to give it a try.  On the move over there we made a 
*slight* tactical error and somehow aggrod 6 shrooms, but I was able to 
keep 4 locked down and keep the 5th off the skirts.  If nothing else this 
convinced the 3 non-guildies that CC wasn't going to be that much of a 
problem.  
We finished off our overpull, and the adds that came from who-knows-where, 
and the rest of the shrooms we could reach, and then finally started on 
the bandits.  It was the most anti-climatic camp-break I've ever seen.  We 
pull a few, I mezz a couple, we kill them all, repeat.  I'm not saying it 
wasn't fun, just that it was very, very easy.
Am I just getting jaded?  Have I been running with so many 60+40AA folks 
that I forget that many exp camps are tough?  Are most players just sheep 
who never try anything other than the easiest possible exp-giving mobs.  
(Hmmmm, based on how much trouble I have convincing folks other than 
guildies that CT is a great zone, I think I've answered my own question.)
