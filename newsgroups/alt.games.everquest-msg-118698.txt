This question gets asked a lot. You should do a search at
groups.google.com using the key words "EQ best duo".

To answer you question quickly...

Melee + Healer

The accepted "best" duo for 1-60 is Shaman/Monk
You can also make a strong argument for Shaman/ShadowKnight

For 1-50 Druid/Melee may be the "best" overall due to added
convenience of travel and the extra damage added with damage shields.
50-60 you really need to be able to slow mobs if you want to grind exp
efficiently.  

The qualities you need the most are to be efficient...
1. Healing
2. Melee (ie manaless) Damage over time
