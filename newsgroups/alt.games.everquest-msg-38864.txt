 God yeah. ToV is friggin annoying. I don't know how many times a night
we have to petition due to bugged corpses that can't be ressed (even if
the resee relogs). Plus they get sent to the zone so now you have to CoH
them back. ToV is the buggiest zone I've ever seen.

 Just a side rant... That place just gets me severely disgruntled.
