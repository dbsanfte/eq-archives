I think one of the reasons they want people down dungeons is that dungeons 
are sort of the focus of the original RPG concept.  It isn't Big Open 
Fields and Dragons, it's Dungeons and Dragons.  You don't have a Rolling 
Hills Master, you have a Dungeon Master.  It's rather like asking what is 
the use of having any race other than human; it's part of the genre.
The thing about dungeons in EQ is risk v. reward.  Dungeons require more 
skill, require a group to work together well, and require additional 
tactics, AND as a result of the increased risk, give out better rewards.  
You complain about mobs that run or gate, why not complain about mobs that 
cheal, or charm you, or even fight back?  The idea is that you have to 
learn tactics a bit more involved than pull one wandering mob, all attack 
that mob, repeat.  You don't have the luxury of pulling low blue mobs when 
you're trying to get nice gear, and if you haven't learned how to deal 
with runners, healers, gaters, etc; you're gonna die alot.
