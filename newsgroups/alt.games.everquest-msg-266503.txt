I admittedly have a better video card than you do (GF6800GT), but with
256MB memory, turning on maximum quality textures doesn't have much
impact on performance and looks _much_ better.

The flora is, I think, absolutely wonderful.  I wish the grass in
Luclin had been like this (and IIRC pre-release screenshots shows
something a lot more like EQ2 than what actually ended up in the
game), but considering how much it takes out of the graphics card and
processor, perhaps it's just as well it wasn't.
