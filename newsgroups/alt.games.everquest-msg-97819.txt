My friend is trying to finish some Magician quest which requires him to
obtain a Ring of Evolv (or somesuch).  In olden tymes (last week) they were
reportedly frequent drops from the alligators in Cazic Thule's pool.  Last
Wednesday we spent 5 hours, and this past Sunday we spent 8 hours, hunting
and killing alligators near the ramp of CT in Ferrott.  Now we were
frequently distracted by Tae Ew, and sometimes there was an astonishing lack
of alligators at all (perhaps spawns are timed to the time of day), but in
all that time we found NO rings and only one torch.  We did literally kill
dozens of Alligators (no, not Swamp Alligators).

Has anyone else noticed a problem with the loot on this spawn since the
change or are we the unluckiest players on Norrath?  Has the loot been moved
to another MOB?
