    Perhaps just delete the plat automatically and send an email to both
accounts explaining why, including the evidence from the logs - ie no
contact between the characters before or after, no believable motive for the
transfer established.

    Yeah, the good thing about an automated system is that CS don't have to
deal with anything except people bullshiting when their plat gets deleted.
This could be minimised by banning accounts of people who are clearly lying,
and by the wording of the automated email.
