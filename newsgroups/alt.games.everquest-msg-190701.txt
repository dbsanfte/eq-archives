Actually, does anyone know of any relevant case law for click through
EULA's being binding?  I don't just mean a decision, I mean the appeal
and decision that make it part of the body of case law.

IIRC (business law was ages ago) there are types of contracts where
one party doesn't have any bargaining power, and some clauses of
those contracts can be unenforceable.  The name for this sort of
clause escapes me.  But it does mean that, just because we click
through a EULA, doesn't automatically mean we are in fact bound by
all the terms.
