Sorry to be a bit slow but the advice on Cleric Spells has got me
confused. Looking at the Casters Realm info on spells describes the
basic function of each spell and whether it is a DD AoE Buff etc which
is clear enough. However, some mailers have been talking about some of
the buff spells as if they have healing properties as well, how can this
be?
I have an 18 Cleric just about to go to Unrest and I really need to know
how I should be using my spells properly or I fear that I wont survive.
My second point is about mobs beating on me as soon as I heal a group
member. What is the best way to reduce the chances of getting hit cos I
am already getting fed up with dying?

Thanks for a great group
