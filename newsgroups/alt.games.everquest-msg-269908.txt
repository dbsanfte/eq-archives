Paying X for the EQ2 box includes the ability to make 20+ classes, the 
13bucks subscription includes the content for each of those 20+ 
classes... your paying for all that content, but your prevented from 
using it. Unless you *double* your payment.

Doesn't make it right. I presume you enjoy living; that life has value 
to you? would you pay someone 500 bucks a week not to shoot you?

Did I say that? No, I didn't.

Ideally enough to enjoy all the options the game has to offer. (ie one 
for each distinct class would suffice as a minimum.)

I don't much care. Once the basic package comes with a reasonable value, 
I don't much care what they tack on as extras because I won't need them. 

They're selling a car and charging you extra for priviledge of using 
your trunk. I don't care how much they charge for a trailer but I expect 
to use the trunk for free.

That's a stretch. I'm not asking for much. Enough character slots to 
play all the paths the game has to offer is not that much.

Its amazing how people will put blinders in front of their own eyes to 
justify their own purchases. Enjoy your extra character slots.
