<snip some valid points>

I believe that levels 1-6 can be done in 30 minutes, is how it was quoted.  
Probably the sort of thing where new players will follow a hand-holding
quest to learn how to play the game, and for them it would take several
hours due to following quest steps and learning the UI, but for those who
know it, they can skip the quests and zip through it fast.  Also worth
noting is that until level 6 you do not choose your starting city (unless
your race only appears in one city), so that is also the moment where you
set your allegiance.

What will come to pass from 7-29 I can't say, but I *can* say that it is
highly highly unlikely they will allow you to skip levels if you already
have high level characters. They intend to put enough fun content in for
low levels that I don't think they would be pleased to let people bypass
it.  So let us just hope that it isn't dull to repeat the same archetype.
