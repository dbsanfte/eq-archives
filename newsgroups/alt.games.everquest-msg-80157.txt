Oh mighty helpful minions.  Question of the day is Ranger's get Instill
Doubt at 22.  I've been told my many that they do not and that there is a
typo in both of the books that I have that say they do.  So the question to
all you Ranger's is:

Where is the trainer for Instill Doubt?

I've been through SFG and their not teaching it there.  I've been unable to
get out to Kithkor, G-Fay, or Luclin.  Can someone please give me directions
to the trainer of Instill doubt, or tell me why there is a typo in two EQ
books that says we get it at 22?  You figure one typo is okay two through in
two different books is a issue.

As always all help is much appreciated

Fred
