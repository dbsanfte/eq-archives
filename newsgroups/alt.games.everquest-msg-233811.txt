My feeling is that :-

1) The amount of cash coming into the game is at an all time high as people
have levelled up.
2) Most of the really good items are no-drop

Which means that any items that are not drop but which are really good will
be in really high demand and people will have more money to pay for them so
prices rocket.
And not so good items have no demand at all so prices will drop to zero in
that you can't sell them at any price.

Which means that the money ends up concentrated in a few places.

I think this probably is the cause of any economy problem more than any
paranoid thoughs about widespead cheating.
