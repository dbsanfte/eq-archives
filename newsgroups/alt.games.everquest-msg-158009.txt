My disk2 sent to UK was corrupt

I opened folder progrma files

Started installation to default

Alt tabbed to open folder and opened the sony/everquest folder
Made new folder called temp
When disk 1 finished installing I moved all the PoP files into the temp
folder
Started disk2 and as it installed files into folder i moved them to temp

Once ther error reported I amde sure all files and folders were moved and
then cancelled the error so installatio nstopped. I copied all the new
isntalled files to my regualr EQ dir and ran patcher. THe patcher then
updated all the files that were missing
