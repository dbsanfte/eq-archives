Depending on what and where you are hunting, baking can be
quite profitable to sell to merchants.  Everfrost is a great
zone for this.  as a newbie you hunt bear cubs, wolf cubs,
etc, and they tend to drop meat.  combine this with a piece
of bread for a sandwich.  then sell the sandwich back at a
profit.  or keep it for yourself so you don't have to by
other food.  As you move up to mammoth calf's is when money
starts coming in better.  one mammoth meat, one slice of
bread, 5 sandwiches.  As your skill progresses you can move
up to steaks, which also will sell for a profit, but reduced
due to more ingredients.  however steaks and beer braised
meats have stats associated with them now.
