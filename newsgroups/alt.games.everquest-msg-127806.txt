Standard Win XP problem here. Previous versions of Windows will check to see
what refresh rate your graphics card and Monitor can do for the Resolution
you are running. Win XP defaults all to 60Hz (mucho flicker). I use a
utility called Refreshlock to cure this. Try at peril as it has been known
to dislike working on some systems.
