OK, so thinking about this, the problem is:

Specific to one character.

Spread across multiple machines.

Spread across multiple zones.

Not universal to all machines.

This suggests to me the problem is on my machines, stored in a file 
associated with my specific character.

Its probably being caused somehow at SOE's end, because I haven't done 
something that I've shared from one machine to the other... but whatever 
it is, it seems to me there should be a workaround on my end.

After discussing it with some guildmates, I've now gone in to my 
Everquest folder using windows explorer, found the two files:

Berg_Combine
and
UI_Berg_Combine

(presumably .INI but for some reason I can't see what their suffix is 
with my primative windows skills)

and changed their names to .OLD

Logging out on machine number three, and now trying to log back in on my 
desktop.

Cutesy messages about polishing erudite foreheads.

Picture of FV on a pirate ship, with no message

Mouse cursor still works
  Goes to crosshair sort of look instead of an arrow

And I'm in.

Funky.
