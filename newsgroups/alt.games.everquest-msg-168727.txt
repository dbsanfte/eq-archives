    Not all of them were crooked, I bet. Take myself. As recently as this
weekend, I still needed two level 61/62 spells: SotP and Faith. Neither was
important enough that I'd shell out what people were asking to buy them, but
I'd still like to have them. So if you asked me if I "needed" a parchment,
I'd say yes because I do. But when I do the turn-in, I very likely won't get
SotP or Faith. So what should I do with the spell? I give my extras to my
guild, for other clerics, but if I wasn't in a guild or had a guild that
wasn't feeding me spells back I'd likely just sell it.
