I have to disgree with this part. It's *not* a free market. A free market
allows participants to enter and leave the market freely. The current
situation has several "camps" available to chanters and if you don't have
one of those camps then you pretty much have to wander from zone to zone
to "sell".

The market in KEI is effectively an oligopoly. A limited number of
participants with supply artificially constrained, and entry to the market
restricted by the number of "camps" available. In a free market an
additional chanter would be free to set up next door and sell for a lower
"donation" (sic).

Admittedly it's possible to ignore those camps but on the few occasions
I've seen it done the person doing it was subject to endless grief by
the chanters already holding the "camps".

The pricing on KEI can be defended in several ways but saying that the
free market sets the pricing is not really true.
