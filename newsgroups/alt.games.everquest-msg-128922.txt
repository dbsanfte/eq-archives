PARENTS BASEMENT-- Jesse Bergevin (not his real name) is not satisfied 
with the quality of computer games he has been pirating off of the 
Internet lately. "Jesse", an avid gamer, doesn't believe he's getting his 
"time's worth" with the recent crop of PC games he has illegally 
obtained. Jesse has been pirating gaming software since he was 13 and 
thinks that this year has been the worst year yet for quality titles.

Most of Jesse's gaming software is acquired through binaries newsgroups, 
FTP sites, and through friends. Over the years he has played many high-
quality games, such as Quake, Unreal, and Half-Life, none of which he 
paid retail for, yet all of which he enjoyed. However, recently, Jesse 
has found that many of the programs being distributed are disappointing, 
and he has become disinterested after playing them to completion.

"I spent two-and-a-half hours downloading Dungeon Siege off of a private 
FTP server, and another twenty minutes finding a crack for the executable 
file," said Jesse. "After playing the game for a week, putting in 
approximately 29 hours of gameplay, I was absolutely bored with the 
point-and-click style of game. That's two blank CDs I'll never get back."
