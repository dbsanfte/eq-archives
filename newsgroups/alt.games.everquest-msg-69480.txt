 Clockspeed mockpeed.....Take a look at the benchmarks. Seems Intel broke the
2.0ghz barrier....but their chip is poo. The 1800 athlon out performs the 2.0P4
in over 90% of these tests..plus its cheaper? I cant see why VI would want to
attach their name to a P4 when AMD out does Intel is directx..o well its a
matter of marketing and kickbacks..
