I have seen the Everquest games on the shelves for years but never paid much
attention to them. So for Christmas I bought the Trilogy, not reading the
fine print and not knowing much about the game. Thought it looked like
Warcraft or Dungeon Siege.

My first misconception was that it was, in addition to being an online game,
a stand alone game. I thought I could hone my skills and understand how
things worked before venturing forth to do battle with the wiley vets out
there online.

Apparently it is not playable except online.

Second false step was the news that there is a monthly fee involved to play
online. But nowhere on the package or the web site or anywhere else with any
prominence does it tell me how much it is going to cost me.

I installed it and started the account setup, and went through this lengthy
process of giving all my vital information, name address, phone number,
hobbies, interests, political affiliation, religion and sexual orientation
and a lot of other information I do not want to give out and just said
"Screw it."

At this point I uninstalled it, removed all registry references to it and
package it back up.  Before I take it back and get a refund, I thought I
would check in at a newsgroup and find out if there were any compelling
reasons why I should not take it back.

Can I play it offline? Do I have to pay a monthly fee (I get the first month
free I see as a new gamer). I have not gamed online, other than over a home
network, so I am ignorant of the joys to be found in online gaming. But I am
willing to be enlightened.
