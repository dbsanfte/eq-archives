Perhaps saying that it justifies our being there was a bit much. I'll 
concede that. My feeling is that there are obviously terrorist factions 
still in operation there that pose a significant threat to U.S. citizens.

However, I'll stand by my point that what those morons did to those Iraqi 
prisoners in those photos does not even *remotely* compare to the 
beheading. I also feel that it was demonstrative of the capacity for evil 
shared by a great many more than just those five individuals - certainly 
not the Iraqi people in general, but the terrorist group(s) these five 
represent.

I will say that the world is justified in hunting down *anyone* who would 
commit such an atrocity. What they did is just evil under any 
circumstances.
