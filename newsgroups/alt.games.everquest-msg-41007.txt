Nice observation, but you need to work on your history.

Although I am not Australian myself, I can tell you that Australians here
are as shocked and dismayed as those of you in America must be. The news
here is already trying to assess how many Australians died in this tragedy.

Idiots abound everywhere, and Australia certainly doesn't have a monopoly on
them. I don't know how you can let this guy push your buttons so easily.

My sympathies to anyone who may have suffered in this terrible event.
