Yep - monthly fee (omg what is it now? 15$? I need to look at my
credit card statement more often instead of just looking at the amount
due). The Realm? OMG is that still up and running? Never played it,
but from what I heard and shots that I saw (a loooooooooong time ago)
- comparing EQ to The Realm is like comparing Halo (xbox fan here) to
Pong! Ok - well not that severe - but you get my drift. I imagine The
Realm ranks just barely above Meridian 59 but below Ultima Online. But
pshaw - i never played it - so im not a fair judge, but I think its
REAL safe to say EQ is FAR better.
