Saw something interesting on Test last night.

I rolled up a Bard and /testbuff'd myself to level 25. I immediately
noticed in the spell book a level 25 Spell "Selo's Rythm" or something
like that. From the description it looks like a selo's that works
indoors. I didn't have time to test it last night, but the thought of
moving through a dungeon at warp speed sounds appealing. 

Is this something new, or I am just out of the loop again :-)
