Why not just link to the thread?

This is the best you can do bizbee?  Come on!
The grand master of flame and Usenet search god, himself, and this is it?
You yank out a thread in which *you* call me out by name, *first*, I haven't
used my name to post in *Years*.  I responded in kind, and you proclaim that
thread to be "proof" that I'm stalking you?  Who was it that went rifling
through the Usenet in the first place?  Do you think anyone is that stupid?

You're not some Usenet noob.  You've got other aliases (everyone knows it,
your mistake btw.), I suspect you forge posts, cancel other peoples posts
and use re-mailers to post anonymously to Usenet.  I'm sure you "stalk"
yourself via re-mailer anonymous Usenet posts also.  You're an old pro and
this is all old hat to you.

I do find it brilliant on your part, you know, the removal of myself from
your killfile, the set up (to bad that week-ago forged post of yours didn't
go through) and then the anonymously posted crap that had been posted by you
at least twice before.  Nicely played for a noob but for you, a really poor
effort.

If you thought I'd stop reading your posts, pointing and laughing when I
thought you were funny or pointing and saying what a jerk when you were
being a jerk, you're wrong.   Nothing has changed.  You post publicly and I
am free to read your posts and comment if I so chose.

I enjoy reading your flames and complaining about complainers daily because
this is what you do best.
You continue, your posting style and I'll continue enjoying reading it.  I'm
free to do so, I'm free to comment on the posts and you're free to do what
ever you wish in public yourself.

My posting to this thread really isn't about my innocence necessarily, at
least at this point.   Some day in the future you'll pull the same scam on
another hapless individual and perhaps just perhaps they will come across
this lovely thread and grasp the concept.  That bizbee is a Usenet player
extraordinary.

Hats off to you sir!
Thank you.
