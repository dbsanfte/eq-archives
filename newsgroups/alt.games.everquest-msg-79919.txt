The trouble with waiting until 60 is that before you can train in ANYTHING
on the 2nd or 3rd tab (level 55, 60) you must earn a certain amount of
points before.

For instance, I have a level 55 enchanter.  I qualify for the 2nd tab but so
far I've only earned 2 AA points so I can't train in my 55 stuff.  Before I
can do that I have to put at least 6 points in the GENERAL skills. :(  I
BELIEVE that before you can train in level 60-specific stuff you have to
have spent at least *12* points but considering how long it'll be before I
get there I haven't paid too much attention to it. :)

The General tab is pretty boring.  If my cleric was 51-54 I'd probably put
the first three in "Innate Running Speed," and the other three in WIS.

Actually, my druid is level 52 and I plan on changing him to 100% AA when he
gets close to 53...I want him to be able to do Naggy and Vox a few more
times and I might as well get SOMETHING from keeping him at 52. :)
