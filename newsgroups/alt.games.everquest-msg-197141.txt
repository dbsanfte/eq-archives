I'd start pushing AC. Also remember that KEI adds 25 to WIS. My 54 CLR
has 230WIS unbuffed (255 obviously with KEI) and 1070AC 2850HP when
self buffed. OK, my resists are poor unless I switch to resist gear,
but I carry some of that in a Haversack ready for raids. Always max
your Defense skills, 1hb and 2hb when possible. Don't forget bash too.
