They wont be able to run around with your 5000 and 3250 for hasten. Get them
to pay you at the bank before you start. Ive never found any need to
compromise... ive MQ'd the boots 3 times now and never spent more than a
couple of hours finding a buyer who will pay up front. Put a link to the
ring, and advertise in both bazaar and on your /auction channel.
I camp the ac in sro in case anyone is interested. It takes more of my time
MQ'ing the rings than finding them, on average. Every time so far ive had to
spawn Hasten. In case you need to, 2 of his placeholders are "maldred the
malevolent" and "a drake"
