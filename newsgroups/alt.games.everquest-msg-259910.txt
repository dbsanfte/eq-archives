What on earth is your point?

I played HC exclusively. I killed exactly one other player, in a server 
running team duels at level 35ish or so.

I wasn't a greifer and I despised greifers. I didn't even enjoy dueling 
much. But the pvp in D2 was very easy to avoid if you didn't want to 
take part.

It was trivial to play games where people you didn't know couldn't get 
in. It was trivial in D2 to bounce from the server the moment someone 
hostiled you.

I was pkd exactly once, due to an exploit I wasn't aware of. Once I was 
aware of it, I was able to avoid deaths as a result of that too.
