Welcome to Blackburrow. Have a nice train.
;-)

No, seriously. Get used to it. Some zones are just train magnets, and
that's never going to change. Generally, these are the lower level
dungeons wehre people are learning their way around (BB being one of the
worst) but you'll run into them all through your career. At level fifty,
you'll see exactly the same shit in Karnor's Castle as all the three
zoners desperately try to figure out what to do in a dungeon when
they've never set foot in one before. Just stay alert, hope people
/shout TRAIN to give you warning, and always remember: Nobody is
responsible for watching your ass but you. So keep an eye open,
particularly in train infested holes like that.
