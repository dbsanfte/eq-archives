At one point, I was levleing up a rogue (notice the spelling?), but 
decided I wasn't having fun with him.  Soooo, I started a wizard.  I 
haven't benn PL'd, and all I got from the rogue was some plat to buy my 
spells.  My armor is all newbie quest stuff (and pretty good, 
considering).  EVERYTHING  Miznit has (other than spells) was earned the 
hard way...quests or fighting.  I think I "gave" him about 700pp to jump 
start his spells, and some of that went to my DE Necro I started as a 
diversion when I was frustrated with trying to find groups (pre-LDoN, 
btw).  Since then, I have gone through that money and more, either on 
spells for Miznit and/or Pewtriid, or (mostly) tinkering stuff...I made a 
bunch of fireworks for the 4th of July, and tinkered bait and collapsable 
fishing rods for a friend. 

Is that considered twinking - or a minor helping hand?  Not that it 
matters in the grander scheme of things, but curiosity leads me to ask.
