I disagree with that sentiment. Some people have to learn the hard way
that the world doesnt revolve around them. Yes, being in a group
requires a group effort, each has his/her own responsibilities in the
group. If one isnt living up to it and refuses to be a contributing
member of the group, then they dont deserve the benefits of the group
IMHO. Perhaps a better method would be to explain to this person (not
that they would listen) as to why they are being considered to not be
rezzed, giving them a second chance. A simple refusal to rez might not
communicate why its being done and will just be seen as a rude
gesture, but saying why will be more effective.
