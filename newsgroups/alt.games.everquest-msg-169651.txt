Just wondering if this is a known bug.

repeat steps:

1) cast improved invisibility on yourself.
2) have a group member cast group foliage shield.

result:
-you a message like, "someone tries to invis you but you are allready
invis".
-the improved invisibility icon on your buff list is replaced by foliage
shield.
-if viewing yourself in third person. your name has parenthesis around it as
normal.
-when you lose invis, you get the foliage shield message (your shimmer of
leaves fades or whatver).
-if you try to cast improved invis, it fails becuase you are allready invis.
now here is the bug part
-you are NOT invis. monsters and players that cant see invis see you just
fine. Going through an area
of hostile creatures that cant see invis, they will attack you.

Ive tested this many times and it repeats every single time. I /bugged it
but was wondering if this was allready a well known bug.
