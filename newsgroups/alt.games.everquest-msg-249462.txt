Sounds like you were applying the wrong strategy. Invis to undead gets 
you past most of the level 1 mobs... and to get the key you need to kill 
a lowbie sk that should be an easy single pull if you fight on his spawn 
point... worst case you might have to out damage a couple necros within 
healing range.

Worth grouping to go in? Yeah absolutely. If you like an interesting 
adventure its a great lowbie dungeon.  :)

If you just want to PowerLevel go back to PC for a bit. :(
