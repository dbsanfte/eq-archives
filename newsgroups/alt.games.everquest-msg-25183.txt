> What does ending a sentence in "P" mean?

In game, EQ cuts out a colon if you don't put a space between that and the
next letter.

What is actually happening is they are ending it in : P

The emoction, as everyone else is saying.


Same with every time you see a sentence in EQ end with )

They actually typed :) and forgot to add the space.   The colon was hacked off
and the smiley became just a close parenthesis.
