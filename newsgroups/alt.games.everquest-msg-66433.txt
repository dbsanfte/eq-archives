I use this Radeon card and the 7189 drivers do not work well with EQ
on my system.  Everything is fuzzy or blurry.  I have loaded the 7075
drivers and everything looks great. Any ideas

Everything looks good except for the TEETH when I am fighting.  The
ATI VE and Vodoo do not have this problem.  Any ideas?
