No, I'm not that concerned. The slight difference just gets more
annoying in 55, where it's more visible than it was in 54 and I was
barely into the level as it was. It was annoying that night because I
would have gotten the little percentage if the bard hadn't gotten
himself stuck, and because group falling apart meant I didn't get
those three kills to make up the difference until the next night.

If I die, I check zone for 56+ cleric, then see if a guildie is
available and willing, and then gladly take a 49+ rez.

And words cannot describe how grateful I am that my pally friend went
up after the bard and rezzed me instead of me trying to find my way up
by myself to get my stuff and camping as a level 54.

(Psst, georg: I'm a she.)
