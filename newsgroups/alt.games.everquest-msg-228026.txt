I think you have that backwards; ogre = 10% penalty, troll = 15% penalty

I also think that of the two, I'd go ogre; his ability to not get 
stunned from the front (which is where the fast majority of mobs hitting 
him will be standing) will make him better at his job of getting and 
holding aggro, and at his secondary job of dishing out some damage while 
doing so.  Regen, on the other hand, only really helps out in the very 
early levels (when it is, admittedly, godlike) or when you have no 
healer at all; its slow enough in its effect that with a healer you'll 
never notice it's going on.  If you plan to solo a lot, a race with 
regen might be a better choice; it will help if you can also twink him 
out with lots of regen items.

But as others have said, none of the racial abilities are really 
overwhelmingly important... and ANY exp penalty might be not worth 
paying.  How about Gnome SK?  No exp penalty, and the advantage of being 
one of the few, instead of one of the many!
