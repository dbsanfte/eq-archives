Personally, having a 54 druid and 57 shaman, I would tell you the shaman is
MUCH better at soloing...sure you can't quad, but when you get your pet at
lvl 34, you really never ever ever risk dying solo again (if you play well).
You are also ALWAYS in demand for your slows and haste in groups, so you
really have the best of both worlds...I think given a choice between a druid
and a shaman, groups will opt for a shaman every time...btw, you can also
tank quite well as a shaman...prob twice the hp as a druid....
