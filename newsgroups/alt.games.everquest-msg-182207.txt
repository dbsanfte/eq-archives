Snare is not root -- it slows the mob down so he can't catch you
and keeps him from running away at the same time.  DOT is damage
over time, such as poison.  So you snare-dot-kite by snaring the
mob so it can't catch you, dotting it (poisoning or otherwise),
and then running around with it tailing behind you like a kite.
Get it?

There's also fear-dot-kiting in which you dot the mob and then
cast fear on it so it runs away in terror.  While it's running
around in terror the poison does its work.  When the fear breaks
it comes running back where you dot and fear it again.  Repeat
until dead.  While it's running around you sit and med.

You can also kite using SoW -- simply dot the mob and take off
running.
