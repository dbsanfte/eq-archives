Let the Warrior pull and wait a couple of ticks when he attacks it
before engaging.  This means you get to med between kills and gives
him a better chance of keeping at the top of the hate list once the
mob is in camp.  Don't snare until the mob is well under 50% dead.
Don't use Flame Lick/Immolate at all.
