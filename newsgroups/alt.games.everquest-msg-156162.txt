OK, Ive done an initial adaptation of the OLGA (online-gamers anon)
version of the 12 Steps. Feel free to add or alter as necessary.

NOTE : this is meant as a satirical retort to those who prefer to
think that our EQ community is "evil" and so on...

(if ye needs to seek help if yer an addict, maybe go here? :

1. We admit that we are  powerless over on-line gaming, and that our
lives have become unmanageable.
 
  
 2. Come to believe that a Power greater than ourselves can restore us
to sanity.
 
 
 3. Make a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of
Tunare as we understand Him.
 
 
 4. Make a searching and fearless l inventory of our charachter(s).
 
 
 5. Admit to the Gods and Goddesses of Norrath, to ourselves and to
all our comrades the exact nature of our wrongs.
 
 
 6. We are entirely ready to have a friendly enchanter remove all
these defects of character.
 
 
 7. Humbly aaccept Sony/Verant's decision to reset our shortcomings.
(LOADING, Please wait!)
 
  
 8. Make a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to
make amends to them all, by /ignore
 
 
 9. Make direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when
to do so would injure them or others (as per the EULA).
 
 
 10. Continue to take personal inventory and when we accidently
ninja-loot, promptly admit it.
 
 
 11. Seek through research and meditation to improve our conscious
contact with Uberness as we understand it, praying only for knowledge
of it's will for us and the power to carry that out.
 
 
 12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we
carry this message to other compulsive on-line gamers and to practice
these principles in all our affairs. (IE: a very sucessful VT raid!)
