Did some googling around, turned up with nothing good. So I went to
Norton's site to RTFM, and i found this:
http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/nip.nsf/4a29389c214c78ea88256c75005f451a/e3df3ed85f8500f388256cc90071f722?OpenDocument&prod=Norton%20Internet%20Security&ver=2003%20Professional%20Edition&src=&pcode=nis&svy=&csm=no

which links primarily to this:
http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/nip.nsf/docid/2003022714315536?Open&src=&docid=2003021012444836&nsf=nip.nsf&view=4a29389c214c78ea88256c75005f451a&dtype=&prod=Norton%20Internet%20Security&ver=2003%20Professional%20Edition&osv=&osv_lvl=

(man gotta love the length of those links)

anyway, that looks like exactly what you were looking for. hope this
helps.
