When Q2 came out a good system was a p166, 32mb and a Voodoo (1) card.
When I started Playing Q2 I was on a PII 266 64mb and a Voodoo 2 (then 2
voodoo 2's) (again this was considered a good sys at that time)
UT was released slightly before Q3 it supports 3dfx (if you use a 3dfx based
card you are laughing) and the Pentium III 600 was considered a high end
Processor at that time. Your spec is ahead of the games you are talking
about (WAY ahead of Q2) try running RTCW or (even) Q3 Team Arena on that
system and then come back and say it's upto the job.

The graphics engine on EQ has always been poor, it was actually better for
many ppl (including me) before the DX7 patch. It has been in dire need of an
overhaul for sometime but when was the last time you played an FFA with 100+
on the map? As for the recommended spec being so high, well I imagine RTCW's
recommended spec is around the same level.
