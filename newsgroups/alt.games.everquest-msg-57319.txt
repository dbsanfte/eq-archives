Why not limit the ability to play as a mob to one zone, and
publish that zone once per day?  Limit the number of players
playing mobs to the normal number of mobs in a zone.  Can
you imagine Karnor's with intelligent Drolvargs?  How
about Kael with intelligent roaming giants?  Velks with
intelligent spiders?

The daily "smart" would then take on an almost event
like spirit.

This would be much better than the current situation of
bluebie would-be griefers logging on in droves and making
the newbie areas tougher than they have to be.

What do you think?
