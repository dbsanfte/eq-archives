    In my opinion, no they don't. 20% more experience required for each
level has a compound effect that makes me absolutely cringe.

    The reason is that at higher levels you gain experience faster, even
though the levels come slower because they require more to ding. Taking 20%
longer to get to each new level means you're delayed at each stage before
your experience income goes up.

    Being blunt about it, regen for a warrior would have to be last on my
list; if you plan on soloing a warrior you're better off closing your
account now. Unstunnable from the front would be second last on my "most
wanted" list for a warrior. You don't cast, what does being stunned
interrupt? A few seconds of your DPS, when you *have* agro. Sorry, just
can't see it as a big deal.

    The extra stamina..... well, every tank finds themself craving that with
passionate abandon in their 50's and 60's, if not before. But look at any 65
raiding guild tank's profile online - 305 stamina unbuffed isn't uncommon,
and just about everybody's got enough STA that a shammy buff will take them
to the cap. Stamina is less effective at levels below where CHEAL is
prevalent, so there's roughly a 15 level window where being an ogre will be
great fun. But it will take you worse than 20% longer to get to that point,
and worse than 20% longer to get through those levels.

    The end result will be the same, taking an ogre in will make it more fun
getting there but take longer. I Say more fun because as a human SK, who (in
line with advice from websites I'd read and verant's little blurb on the
matter) put his starting points in str, I've felt the papertank syndrome
quite severely in my 50's. I'm rapidly overcoming that with gear now though,
and its only a matter of time before I hit the cap too.

    One last thing. Arguably the greatest tank in the game is a human
warrior.

    So pick the race you like the look of is my advice. Forget stats, forget
the numbers. In the end none of them matter.

Regards,
James
