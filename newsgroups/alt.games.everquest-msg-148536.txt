At level 60, all in all, Shadowknight is the strongest. The outcome of
many fights is determined by gear, then skill and class. These new
resist changes are strange, though. Getting snared with 160+ mr is not
my idea of a good time.

As an enchanter, if I attack before someone sees me coming, it's
almost a given I can win the fight if I want. However, if someone is
prepared, crimson potions make mezzing a PITA.
