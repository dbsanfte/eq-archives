Just watched this movie for the first time.

Ack.

Awful movie, don't watch it.  Rot your brain.

Ok, that said, its really fantastic bad movie fodder.

But put aside all the gore, all the horror, all the annoying
giggling.

Whats really going to stick with me is the scene where Ash is
standing there while his sister attacks his friend.  Just
standing.  Holding the axe.  Backing up a bit to stay out of the
way.  But not holding the axe in an aggressive manner, nor an
offensive way, not even really like its an axe, it could as
easily be an umbrella he happens to have in his hands, he's not
paying any attention to it.

The situation is entirely beyond him and he fails to respond to
it at all.

Thats genius.
