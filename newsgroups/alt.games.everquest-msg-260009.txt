Sounds like you had fun anyway, which to me is the important 
part=) I love a good ring war...did a whole series of them last 
summer on SOl Ro. Had a regular little group, and they used to 
put us on last ditch cleanup by the waterfall. We stopped more 
random giants last second! I think out of 13 ring wars we only 
lost 2 [mainly for the same reason, not enough people]

One organizational point, our fearless leaders would do a more 
zone defense sort of thing, and he tried to make sure that there 
was a snarer and a rooter in each group, and as my groups 
cleric/rooter I was ordered to pound them with root as soon as 
they hit 25% and keep them rooted as long as I kept my group 
alive. We also tended to have 2 or 3 epic clerics and assorted 
other buffers doing nothing but playing rez tag with people and 
hitting them with heals and buffs.

*sigh* I really need to log in and see if there is a ringwar any 
time soon...I am getting SO tired of killing gobbos in nurga for 
faction=(
