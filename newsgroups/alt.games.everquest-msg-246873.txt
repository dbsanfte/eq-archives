Go to the last character at this URL...her name is Usenet.  ^_^  (Because
"Flamer" was already taken.)

I think I've settled on those three characters on Virtue.  Foxeye is still
my favorite...I switched her from Empathy to Kinetics.  I've probably
screwed her for being "in demand" by dropping the best healing powerset,
but frankly I'm having a lot more fun with her now.  Being really good at
running away (kinetics is the choice for the cowardly types, heeheehee)
seems to fit the way I woudl want to play a 4' tall fox.  She's really
more of a roguish type than a Florence Nightengale.

Teaming her up with my husband's controller was the most fun I've had
yet.  I think maybe I was missing out by doing a tank/healer combo in
EQ...would have had a lot more fun with a caster/caster team. ^_^
