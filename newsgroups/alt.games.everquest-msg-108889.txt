    Yup, 30. For Rastus: as a general rule, they have to be hurt to summon.
So with two of them, try training your pet to get away as opposed to DoT'ing
the second. They'll also chain-summon when you get low on life, which is
real fun - you'll get summoned, and the mob that summoned you will have just
enough time to take a swipe at you before the second one also summons you.
At that point Harmshield and maybe Feign are your only hopes.
