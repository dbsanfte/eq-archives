Most of the better charm kiters will get to numbers around 20-25 if they
can. It makes for your pet going down VERY fast.

I do as many as I can find, and have gotten up to 20 or so a few times. My
problem is usually one of targeting. I have a nasty habit of getting off on
my targeting and subsequently not getting full xp for the mobs.

For the original poster, the other posts here have outlined it fairly well,
but to summarize:

-do damage on your would be pet (dot it at least once)
-either before or while doing this, drag the pet around trolling up more
aggroed mobs - do not let your pet get too far down, or you'll miss the
point.
-Charm your mob, and have it attack something else in the pack - ideally
something towards the front of the pack
-The pack will usually "swarm" your pet. I say usually because you'll have
more that ignore your pet if you chose mobs that aren't very social. The
more social, the better.
-Have your pet report health OFTEN. Depending on the swarm, the pet will go
down in health FAST.
-When the mob is low (how low is a matter of taste) on health, break the
charm (invis - most prefer to have an insta-click item for this).
-Chant the mob to death
-Pick a new mob, wash, rinse, repeat.
