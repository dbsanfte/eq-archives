Yes, kill dead frogs and the live ones, along with Gukta frogs, will
like you for it.  Avoid killing live frogs unless you are a monk going
for an epic drop.

> Are the undead shin frogluks harder to kill then dead?

Yes and no.  They are about the same level as the live froggies,
however they are a bit harder to get to and more dangerous to kill. 
The live frogs in lower guk are found near the zone in.  For the dead
frogs you have to go further in, further from the zoneline, and to
places where you will have more problems with adds.  At 34, Guk is
horrible for adds...

> Any tactic recommendations?

Take a group.  I don't know for certain, but at their level, the Shin
Ghoul Knights probably pop in the bedroom (it has a bed in it).  See
if you can get a group there.  Past this point, the whole zone gets
much more dangerous at your level.
