I have never been in a situation where a two-boxed cleric could be (or
has been) considered as effective as a single-box.  No one would be
naive enough to think that a chimp could play a cleric.  You still
have to time everything correctly, be ready to switch tanks, MGB
Ethereal Elixir in some fights, DA in others (such as the Arch Mage in
Plane of Fire), and basically be flexible enough to handle mistakes
made by others.

To answer the other question, yes, parsing the seconds does make more
sense.  The chance for human error is significantly decreased with the
/pause command, and therefore my tank is less likely to die during a
complete heal rotation.  So what if people DO think that a chimp could
play my character?  They would be incorrect, and I know that.  I won't
increase the chance of death for my tank/failure for my raid out of
pride in my ability to count seconds.

As I said above, I can and have done rotations either way.  It does
not bespeak my skill or lack thereof that I prefer to have the /pause
command available to me in my hot buttons.

Actually, in my opinion, one has to be more vigilant because of the
/pause command, to combat that kind of laxity in case something goes
wrong.  It's a tool, like any other.

How many clerics do you know who are in a healing rotation for the
entirety of a raid?  We still have to handle our groups in between
killing named.  That's where the true skill of a cleric is shown
anyway - not in a complete healing rotation that, no matter how you do
it, amounts to paying attentiont o what the cleric before you has
done.

If you ignore changes in the situation in favor of merely looking for
the "Cast CH NOW" message and hitting your hot button, you will not be
successful as a cleric, because things change, strategies change, and
fights have a way fo taking on lives of their own.
