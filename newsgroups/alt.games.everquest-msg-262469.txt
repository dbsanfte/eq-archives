Why set yourself up for disappointment?  Seriously...  Can you even point to
a presidential candidate that hasn't lied to the American people at some
point?  They say George Washington never told a lie...  but I wouldn't bet
on it.

No, what's sad is that the Bush administration thought it was necessary,
when there were plenty of other legitimate reasons for the war on Iraq.

Of the sanctions on Iraq imposed after the first gulf war, not a single one
of them wasn't violated.  The UN, demonstrating just how useless it is, did
nothing.  The UN should thank the US for preserving some of its credibility.

Though you are correct.  Clinton never promised anything.  Ever.  He was
really good at saying something that he could then claim, and be technically
correct, that he never said.  It was a talent, and will undoubtedly be his
page in the history books.  =)

I was wondering the same thing when you implied that Clinton had "reversed"
anything.  =)

Correction, I express no approval for republican policies or democrat
policies.  I find both sets of policies abhorrent, ethically bankrupt,
deceptive, and in general stupid beyond belief.

I find Clinton to be the worst president we've ever had, which is a pretty
impressive achievement.  In my lifetime, Carter and Ford would then come in
as #2 and #3 in that list.  Notice, a republican does make the top 3.  Ford
was an idiot.

As I've mentioned, here and elsewhere, I don't vote.  I have too much of a
conscience to choose between stupid and evil.  When someone runs for
president that actually says something I find worth supporting, I will run
out and vote for him.  I'm guessing I will die an old man without ever
having voted.   =)

I disagree with the Bush administration on government spending, government
regulation of health care, and use of the military.  I don't agree with the
Kerry campaign on anything.  Oh wait, I just said I don't agree with the
Bush administration on anything.

Neat how that works.

Though I've gotta say, Kerry must be the most boring person to run for
president since Bob Olde, er, Dole.

Why would you say that?  Enamoured with psuedo-celebrity?

Or were you commenting on the fact that Bush, Sr.'s "voodoo economics"
being used by Bush, Jr. shows a lot of conviction?

I meant to point out the incongruity of that paragraph in the first run
through, but it's since been snipped.  =)

I tell that to every Lexus, Benz, Volvo, BMW and Jaguar-driving person I see
who has a "Kerry 2004" bumper sticker.  =)

I think you'll find that all of those countries have at one time or another
(usually at the height of their military power) been economically powerful
as well.

You'd be hard pressed to find praise for Bush in anything I've posted.  It's
amusing that you see my post as such.

The tax cut was a simple, across-the-board, tax cut.  100% of the people in
the country got 100% of the tax cut.  The wealthiest 10% in the country
accounted for 90% of the actual dollars saved perhaps, but that's mixing
un-like percentages.  Now compare what percentage of taxes those 10%
paid compared to the other 90% of Americans.

And you wonder why people might assume you are a closet Marxist, when you
