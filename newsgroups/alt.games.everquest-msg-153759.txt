just a thought on the monks getting less damage than a plate wearing
class.

Ok big beast hits you in plate... you cannot move very quick due to
the cumbersome weight, and Smack hits you, now armor protects you to
some extent, but that area is crushed in on your body... next hit
crushes even more.... less mobility at this point.  You are not a very
mobile individual.  You take the brunt of the damage, no real damage
mitigation except for reposit.

now a monk.... big beast hits monk, sure he's wearing a dress/robe.
but he can move like a reed in the wind...  move with the blow.  hence
damage mitigation. along with dodge, and reposit, even more damage
mitigation.  I think of Jet Li in black mask when he does battle with
his friend,  He just avoids the blows, never really taking the full
force.


again just a thought and i'm sure full of holes like swiss cheese.
