Legality aside (for the sole station owner in the example is being
greedy and opportunistic.)

This is not an example of a "free" market. In a free market, there are
"many" sellers and "many" buyers who all have choices to make. Their
choices (sellers setting prices of their products or services based on
their perceived needs and buyers seeking goods or services at a price
that meets their perceived needs) will eventually boil down to the
argued about "market price" (which will change over time).

This is an example of a monopoly situation (and an opportunistic
response to the stipulated situation) of one seller and "many" buyers.
Again, legality aside, this the kind of situation you get when you
have ONE seller and lots of buyers OR ONE buyer and lots of sellers.
Lacking alternatives, the sole supplier or the sole buyer has
virtually unlimited ability to set the price of a product or service
regardless of what the "fair" value might be. I write "virtually" for
it is possible for a sole seller to set a sale price noone can or will
pay or a sole buyer to set a "will pay" price that no seller can or
will accept.

In fact, the hypothetical greedy station owner is being foolish by
setting a set price. He'd probably get more if he could get people
together and have them bid on a tankful of gas (not withstanding the
approaching disaster which created the circumstances).

In this situation of a major emergency, government interference (e.g
anti-price goughing laws) is not the problem. If the owner's concern
is getting the maximum number of people out, he'd ration how much
anyone could purchase. If it was a use it or lose it situation (think
of a supermarket without power facing loss of all perishable food), he
might just give it away for free (and still ration it).

And this example is not one of a free market.
