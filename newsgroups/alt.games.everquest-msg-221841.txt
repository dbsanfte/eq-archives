Then the druid was the Backup healer.  Backup healer is ready to
heal when for whatever reason the main healer cannot.  With a
shaman main healer, a backup healer is a particularly good idea
for just the reason you describe.   However, based on level or
just on raw massive mana regen, the shaman can still be the
better main healer.
