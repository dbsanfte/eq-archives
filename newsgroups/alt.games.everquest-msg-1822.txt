I wouldn't try going around the edges, the one time I almost tripped over
a spider was when I tried that.   Also, you'll have to go way out of your
way to get around them all.

Just keep your eyes open and walk right down the middle next to the
river.   They're not too hard to get past if you take care not to go too
close to them (as someone else said, very small aggressive radius.)
I've done it visible and without SoW 20 or more times between levels 20
and 35 and never gotten attacked.   As I said, the only close call even
was when I tried hugging the wall from the Dreadlands tunnel to Ill Omen.

But, then again, I'm an acknowledged nut.  I successfully crossed
Kithicor Forest in the middle of the night at level 14, un-sowed and
visible.   Now *that* was fun. ;)
