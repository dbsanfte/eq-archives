Looking forward to next move and again seeking advice from those who
have gone before.  Assume a 44 Warrior and 40 Cleric.  Both with fairly
"middle of the road", definitely *non* twinked armor, weapons, items,
etc. full compliment of spells for the cleric.  Hoping that the
warrior/cleric combo is a good one to form the base of a group and
attract more quickly.  Looking for good zones with decent xp and
hopefully some fairly impressive loot, but mostly a chance to find some
other classes looking for pick up groups.  Would prefer a dungeon for
the xp bonus, but any zone that's not exclusively b.y.o.g. would be
great.  Have both expansions, willing to travel. (Will not do windows or
vacuum.)
