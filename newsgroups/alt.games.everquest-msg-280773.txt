I wish there were a server for original Everquest.  By that I mean with
*no* expansions.  No Kunark, no Velious, no Luclin, no lizards, cats,
or frogs.  No bazaar, no book of knowledge, no maps, and none of the
other "enhancements" that have taken the thrill out of the game and
replaced it with monotony.  I want it to be challenging to get from
Freeport to Qeynos -- either sneak through Kithicor or find a wizard.
Run like hell.  Make the journey more fun than the destination.  It
used to be that way.

I want there to be a meaningful penalty when you die.  I want druids
and wizards to be able to make a living teleporting people. I don't
want magic trails leading me to my goals.  I don't want NPCs chasing me
down to give me quests.  Make tailoring a valuable skill again -- no
armor quests.

Make the game hard again.  I'd be glad to pay a premium to play on a
server that had no expansions or enhancements.  Bring back the original
game.

Anyone else?

Larry
