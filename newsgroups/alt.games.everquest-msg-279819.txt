Heh... you could always fund an alt outside of the guild, lol.

Or just buy the equivalent from that gnome in SolA. Of course, in my 
case I don't have them. I don't need them. I have enough WR bags that 
I'm not overburdened... beyond that big deal.

A monk might really care... but a smart monk won't want more than one 
anyway, and can probably make do with a rallic pack, EE bag, or 
something until haversacks are available. :)

Paying even for "level appropriate gear" undermines the point. If its 
truly level approrpriate go get it yourself. :)
