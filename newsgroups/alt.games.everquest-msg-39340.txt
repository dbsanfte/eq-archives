If it makes you feel any better....

Over the weekend I got a pair of Tolan's Darkwood Gauntlets. The guy I got
them from was in the Great Divide and my ranger was in Dreadlands, so I went 
up there with my druid to pick them up. Flew back to my wife in the Dreadlands
and handed the gloves to her to give to my ranger.

Of course by then a group of friends had gathered and were demanding the
services of my enchanter. We spent the morning adventuring and when it
was over we made a few exchanges to alts, banked and quit.

Later that day we got back on and I asked my wife to finish the exchange
of the gauntlets. Her first response was "oh no....", then, "you are
going to hate me...."

Yup, she had sold the gauntlets to a vendor, and I don't hate her. I just 
hope she remembers this the next time I do something dumb.
