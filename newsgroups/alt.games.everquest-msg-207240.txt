Actually, go check out the magelo profiles of bards from uber guilds...most
aren't using the Bard epic, it seems.

While doing that, I also checked out Wizards, since my main is a Wizard.
Jesus, those uber Wizards have some impressive equipment.  4589 HP, 1043 AC,
all resists over 300 except one at 275, all stats well over 200 except
charisma (most near 300, int 355).  Flowing Thought 15 (the cap).  Jesus!
