Yeah, they could fix it pretty easily.  Underground mobs are usually
well below the lowest spot in the zone, so a simple periodic

	if ( mob->z < zone->lowest_z )
		mob->z += 1000;

would do the trick.  It would be entertaining, too, as mobs that get
under the world would then fall from the sky.  Note that since mobs
don't take falling damage, they would not even have to move them to a
safe spot.  They just have to get them above the world and let them
fall.

If they are reluctant to add any periodic code to the server, the
other way to fix this is to let the client do most of the work.  The
EQ server sends to every player in the zone the position of every mob.
That's how ranger/druid/bard tracking works: everything is sent, and
then the client checks your skill and position, and decides what to
show.  They could make the client do under-the-world checks on nearby
mobs, and if it finds one under the world, the client could tell the
server.  The server could then do some verification and reposition the
mob.
