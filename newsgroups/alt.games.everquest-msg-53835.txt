I will have to try that, I thought about seeing if I could level up my
necro the rest of the way in OOT, looking at the bestiary with
allakhazam's it seems like it should be possible but i found the aviaks
there were either green or red at my level.  Would like some more
experience i think before i risk the reds.  I am getting a little more
comfortable with hopping the boat in OOT so I may try actually binding
in the zone.  A thought, what levels are the brothers on brother island
and what faction are they on?  Is it human like the fisherman in Oasis? 
Haven't found anything else on Human faction yet.

Can't remember to Gargs count as undead for purposes of lull undead?  I
know the lull spell line is about useless, it's designed for starting
trains of undead i think.

Thanks for the advice, i was enjoying OOT while hunting the sisters of
erollisi.
So I may be headed back there.  It was fun to basically say the hell
with faction while hunting the sisters too.  I have avoided the bard
camps though so as to maintain my faction in Freeport.  At least until I
am ready to make the Militia into my undead army that is
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA.

I never hunted the crushbone orcs, got a couple faction hits against
them when they aggroed me when i was low level and passing through
butcher block, but i never actively hunted them.  I wanted to keep my
neriak factions as unblemished as possible.  I found later that really
wasn't necessary as the indigo brother hood doesn't leave the warrior
guild but no loss there, i don't need to deal with  elves.
