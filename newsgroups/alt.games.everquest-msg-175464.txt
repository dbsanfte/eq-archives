Given the sheer amount of hype that we're getting, and how utterly cool
everybody thinks it's going to be, he's probably right. He doesn't say
it's going to suck. Just be less wonderful than everyone thinks.

I can understand why they're planning the expansion already. What's Star
Wars without the Stars? If people didn't think the space part wasn't at
least in the pipeline, they wouldn't get nearly as many players.

I'm just wondering how they'll be implementing the planets... will each
server be a planet, that you can travel to? Now *that* would be cool.
None of this messing around with character transfers.
