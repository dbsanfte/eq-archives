Stop in EC at the last middle inn, by the zone to WC. There is an erud
lady indiff to all (beta neutral) who sells unlimited rat ears and
other reagents. Buy a bunch, go to rephas, allied fast.

Knights of truth have nothing to do with Arcane scientist raising, 
but is easy to raise killing EC, WC and now Nektulous!(Four camps
there, usually deserted of players, same factions but no belts) Orcs.

Druid turn Lenny into a wolf. Lenny do quests with Rephas.
This quest can be done at dubious as far as I know.
Note: That quest raises arcane scientists but lowers opal darkbriar of
the east freep sewer and lowers the militia.

You might want to do jenam and rebby (see allakhazams east freeport
quests) a bunch first. These raise militia and things, then go do rat
ears with rephas, then more jenam and rebby, etc.
