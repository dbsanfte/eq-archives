anyone who is going to play on both Test and proddie (regular) servers 
should have  2 directories for EQ.  Just make a new folder titled testEQ 
and copy all your EQ files to that, then using the testeverquest.exe 
from that folder, patch and then play.  Should have a large patch the 
first time you patch.
If you don't have 2 folders for EQ, when you go back to proddie server 
you have to repatch alot of stuff.  Test and proddie are totally 
different files, alot of things on test are not on the regular servers. 
  Patching and re-patching is a PITA.
