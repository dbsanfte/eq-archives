I *have* gotten off the island. I just couldn't get off with my first 
char, and there were several others there that couldn't either. Not to 
mention things like adding to a collection quest randomly starts the 
quest all over again and a ton of other bugs and that was just on the 
starter island that should be really polished by now. There are lots of 
other problems once you get off the island too.

Having said that, there are also some very cool things. Like clicking on 
a hidden barrel starts a quest and other similar random quests that fit 
into the world environment.

So far, my opinion is still that WoW is the better game, but I think EQ2 
might just hold my attention longer because of the slower leveling speed 
and more PvE encounters for high end raids/groups (that is if they live 
up to their promises). WoW could also be interesting long term as well, 
however, because I am not a PvP fan, but I really liked the way it was 
implemented in WoW - so much so that I am seriously thinking of playing 
a full-PvP server at launch.
