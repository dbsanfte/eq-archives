Ghoulbane drops in Guk (forget which one) and should be attainable around
level 30.  There was a quest for it, but I think the quest is broken since
they removed the skeletons in Najena.

Wurmslayer is a quest, requires you to kill high level dragons/wurms, you're
better off buying one, I see them from 5-8k.
