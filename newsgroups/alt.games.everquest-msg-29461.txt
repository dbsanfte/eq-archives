Just for fun and being able to do it, how can I increase my faction with
Dark Elves?  At the very least, I'd like not to be KOS to the guards when
running through Nektulos Forest to get to Lavastorm Mountains.  I'd even get
a kick at being able to walk around inside Nerviak.  I'm sure I'd surprise
quite a few Dark Elf players by doing so.  So is there a way?  I've been
asking this of players for a long time now and no one knows how you can do
it.  I'm figuring I'd have to kill something next to the zone lines, but not
sure what or which zone line (Lavastorm's or Commonlands) is best.
