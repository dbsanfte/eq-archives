The time I got my flag the healers (me and a druid) were so LoM on the 
boss the only thing that saved us was the ench chain runing the tank. He 
landed 10-15 runes on him.. :)

Yesterday I was helping a friend through, failed on boss because shaman 
and pally were mezzed by a rare on last wave.. Should've had someone 
kite him I guess but noone thought about that :)

Been in quite a few trial runs to date, it's amazing how much a couple 
of 'uber' melee's can do for the group. Some groups just own the place, 
kill quick enough to get bored waiting between waves, other groups every 
wave is a stretch of the limits. A mage with epic or 61+ pets are also a 
very good addition to any trial group.
