Yeah, but what would be the point?

It doesn't make that big of a differnece, as Esorpa of the Ring is the only
RoS dragon that actually stays up for any length of time on my server...  and
if I did make the effort to fix it, a few days later I would still be killing
Gorenaire for scales and books, or Sev for scales, or Talendor for more books,
or the guppy for Leafblowers... and have to fix it all over again.
