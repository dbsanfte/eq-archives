How about taking the idea a couple of steps further?

Animals that hibernate and migrate anyone?  So in the winter all the 
bears and squirrels disappear, and snow wolves are seen again.  It 
might be that some races can get into dangerous places in the winter 
when everything that hates them is sleeping, providing they're gone by 
summer of course!

How about quests tied to the seasons?

Khayden says, "Hail, a random_quest_NPC"
a random_quest_NPC says, "Hail Khayden.  The citizens of village_01 are 
in need of supplies before Winter arrives.  Can you [help us collect 
firewood]?"

I think this would add an interesting dimension to the game.
