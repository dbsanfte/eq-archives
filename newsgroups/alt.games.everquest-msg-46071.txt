Saw something like this in DL a few days ago. 3 mages, 1 necro and 1
enchanter. They literally wiped the east side of KC clean.

But in any case, 3 or more mages in any group is simply amazing. The dam
output of both pets and nuking stuff to death from 40 to 50% health is
simply astonishing. Everyone should see a group such as this once in their
Norrathian careers :)


Kilmir, having fun with his new dot
