To answer that question, consider this. You're around level 12, and you're
looking for a group in, say, Crushbone. You say /ooc "Level 12 Warrior LFG".
A second later another /ooc pops up "lvl 11 twinked war lfg, warrs roxor!"
Some people would be more likely to choose the twink, which would bug you
since you spent more hear-earned time to reach that level.
