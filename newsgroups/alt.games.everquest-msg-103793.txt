To add to that, the real reason you are going to be able to get a group is
because you have played with lots of people and they know you are good in a
tight situation (i.e. you follow directions, think reasonable, know your
responsibility).  Monks are loved in the middle years for pulling, and at
high end for dishing out damage.  Just solo at the low end with them.  Bards
usually don't have a tough time finding groups after level 6 (heal song),
but solo'ing isn't really fun till 26 when you get your fear song.
