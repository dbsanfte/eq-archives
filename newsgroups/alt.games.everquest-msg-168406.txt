Yuh, I'm doing 20/80 at lvl 57 and it looks like about the same rate.  I 
wasn't very anal about measuring it, though.  

I'd generally be of the 100/0 or 0/100 school of thought, but... somehow if 
I'm in a group that's getting unbelievably good exp I can't resist the urge 
to twitch just a bit of it into AA. :)
