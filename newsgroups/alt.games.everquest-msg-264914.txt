Hmmm...is that a reference to some movie, or is ground shaking as undead
rise up a common thing in horror fiction, or what?  I'm curious because that
is pretty similar to the message that happens in DAoC in a zone that has a

or legend about undead that both sets of zone designers were drawing from.
