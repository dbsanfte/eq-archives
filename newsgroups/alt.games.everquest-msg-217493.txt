Sad but true. And the hugely successful launch of SWG (only in terms
of sales $$$$) only reinforces the "rush out the door" mentality of
the corporate big wigs. I was horrified when I was beta testing SWG
and wading through the mire of bugs and lack of content when they
announced the launch date 2 weeks ahead of time. I had hoped the
MMORPG world had learned from the mess that Anarchy Online offered at
launch (which btw has done a 180 in my book). How wrong I was.

On a slightly different note, I must give SOE kudos on LDON. It was a
suprisingly smooth launch compared to the other expansions. Perhaps
they've finally got it down and EQ2 will be just as smooth (HAHAHAH ok
- ive had my morning laugh).
