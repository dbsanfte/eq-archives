If you're already fighting "challenging mobs" that are deep blue to you
(i.e. 52+ mobs) then it sounds like they will still be blue at 61. If
you are the type more used to grinding out enless AA points on stuff
that's hardly challenging for a low fifties group, you'll have to move
on.  Big deal.

Your description makes it appear you fall into the first category, so
you have nothing to worry about. Those who follow the easiest path will
continue to do so, and likely not bother you.

You make it sound like there's only two places in five expansions that
have mobs higher in level than 52. 

As to you comments about "two planes open" in PoP and the rest needing
keys... isn't that the point? So get a key. We haven't even stepped foot
in it yet and you're writing off the entire expansion as useless for xp?
Personally I hope to find new places to xp there.

New Stuff = Good  (Even if it's broken to shit and takes a month to get
the bugs out as usual.)
