No, he's not.   Or at least he wasn't the last time we did a collect.
Anything that he came into range of aggroed on him as he was walking.   He
did not fight once we pulled it off him, but he definitely gets attacked if
you left something up in a room he has to pass through.

Mobs switch off pet and NPC targets instantly when you get on the hate
list... so as long as the group walks with him instead of running ahead and
splitting up like idiots, theres no real chance of him dying.
