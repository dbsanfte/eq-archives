I've been playing my baby Bard  again lately (haven't palyed him in quite
some time), and got him to level ten.  At ten, you get dodge, and meditate.

I'm still learning the ropes of playing a Bard, twisting songs and all, and
was wondering why a Bard really needs meditate.

Is that just to help mem songs quicker?
