Long ago and far away, a friend of mine had a D&D campaign that had
exactly that.  When you drank from "The Fountain" the DM rolled a d6
and you went up or down 1-3 levels.  If you went below L1 you died,
if you drank from the fountain a second time you died (no Raise Dead
dead possible, there was no body, you just poofed).

One day this fringe member of our little gaming community, a guy
with a special talent for annoying people, brought a character in
from some Monty Haul campaign.  He was told about "The Fountain",
including the strict warning about drinking twice.  Then, after he
had his drink, one of the women in the group used the spell Whisper
to tell him "Go ahead, drink again, it's all right... for you" (i.e.
she surreptitiously passed the DM a note and he then told the victim
about this voice he heard in his ear).  So the genius drank and
vaporized, ridiculous gear and all.  Which just shows to go ya that
"grief" play dates back to the PnP days (someday perhaps I'll bore
you all with the tale of "The Saturday Night Massacre" from yet
another campaign).
