If I recall correctly, there some spells you need to buy at shadowknight
guilds.
Easiest would be to make a troll mule and buy it at grobb SK guild, or if
you prefer doing it in character, pay some newbie troll to go and buy them.

There should be a SK vendor under freeport that sells these, but I wasnt
able to find it. I think I ended up getting a port and buying them at the
paineel SK guild.
