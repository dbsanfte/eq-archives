One of the best cheap newbie weapons out there is a smoldering brand.
9/22 ratio with a minor DD proc that procs at first lvl. It's also a
1hb so almost any class can use it. It doesn't have any stats but
those are meaningless at that level anyway and you should be able to
pick one up for under 100p.
