Hi all
Maybe someone can help me. I can get the Investigator's Badge with no
problem.
The 2nd Badge is giving me a tuff time. I turn in the 1st badge in NQ and
get the book.
After which I give the book to the Investigator in SK. Then after he says
follow me.
He gets to the Hermit's place and stops. He doesn't do anything further.
I've tried everything I can think of.
Has anyone done this quest on the Vazaelle server.
