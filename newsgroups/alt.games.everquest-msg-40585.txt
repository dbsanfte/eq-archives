Yep, although the level cubed part isn't as scary as it sounds - the XP
needed to complete this level is (thislevel^3) - (lastlevel^3), i.e.
the *difference* between the cubes of the two levels.

To finish a given level L, you need (L^3) * 1000 * M.  1000 is the
constant multipler, M is the level modifier - this starts at 1, and
increases by 0.1 at certain levels, the hell levels.

So to finish level 1, you need (1^3) * 1000 * 1 = 1000XP.  To finish
level 2, you need (2^3) * 1000 * 1 = 8000XP.  But you already have
1000XP from completing level 1, so 7000XP is required to get from the
start of level 2 to the end.  Then level 3 requires 27000 - 8000 =
19000XP, level 4 requires 37000XP, and so on.

Racial penalties/bonuses can adjust these figures a little (e.g. Trolls
level slower than Halflings), but there are no class penalties
anymore.

And a hell level example: to get through level 29, you need:

  (29^3) * 1000 * 1 - (28^3) * 1000 * 1 = 2,437,000XP

To get through level 30, you need:

  (30^3) * 1000 * 1.1 - (29^3) * 1000 * 1 = 5,311,000XP

And to get through level 31, you need:

  (31^3) * 1000 * 1.1 - (30^3) * 1000 * 1.1 = 3,070,100XP

Note how the modifier goes from 1 to 1.1 at level 30, causing a big
spike in the XP needed to finish the level.  This is how all hell
levels work.

Hmm, too much time on my hands :)
