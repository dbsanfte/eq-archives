the other thread about rangers sucking...i was the guy who said my 40ish war

seriously though, i doubt they have as little ast 40 dps....tanks at 55 have
more than 40 dps...i've parsed 52 and 53 monks with 60+ dps with [pretty]
similar gear

well, again, thanks.......still, i don't want to think that monk dps has to
get 'turned on' after the correct sequence of obsessive gaming (aka
leveling), because that's why i stopped leveling my ranger ( a good thing
IMO; i'll play my ranger when i want to play a ranger, not when i want to be
a manaless 'nuker')
