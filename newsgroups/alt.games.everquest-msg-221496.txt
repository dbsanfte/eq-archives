It -is- a role playing game, at least theoretically.  While its
all well and good that 99% of us live in a perpetual
communist/startrek all for one and one for all, share and share
alike mode, if someone happens to want to play a capitalist
character who is willing to negotiate a "what the market will
bear" contract, whats wrong with that?

I think the market won't bear anything at all, myself, and that
this attitude is going to leave the cleric in question festering
in a vat of loneliness and despair... but then maybe I'm too big
a Roddenberry fan.
