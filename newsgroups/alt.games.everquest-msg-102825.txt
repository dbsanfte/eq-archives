Excuse me?  Are you having a problem with your reading comprehension?
Or perhaps you have a special definition of hypocritical you'd like to
share with the rest of us?  His statement is that _because_ sales of
EQ items and platinum for real-world cash occur it could be argued
(presumably by the government, in court) that EQ gambling is real-world
gambling.  Because of this Verant cannot provide gambling in-game.
There is no shred of hypocrisy in that statement.  It is clear, direct,
and no doubt dictated by the Verant (Sony?) legal counsel.
