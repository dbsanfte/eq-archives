Thanks to everybody... you gave great advice!
I did what I thought I might want to do and joined a guild.
I absolutely love it.  It's more of a chat guild than anything, which is =
just fine by me -- gives me something to chew on while medding for 10 =
minutes at a time.  But, the people are very friendly and helpful... =
much more forgiving than the general public can be if you need to ask a =
question/sell something/etc.

I'm not sure if I'll continue to feel this way, we all know how things =
can change... but for now at least, I'm thrilled.

Thanks again!

~Nikki
