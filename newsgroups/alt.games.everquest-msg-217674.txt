    Thanks for posting that. I found it:

    'Hidden revenue streams are just starting to be understood. Sony runs
about 42 versions to avoid overpopulation in any one world. But instead of
simply load-balancing the number of players per computer, it allows fans to
relocate their characters to different worlds on other servers -- for $50 a
move. "Would you believe we've generated over $1 million in revenue simply
from moving characters?" Smedley marvels.'

    That sounds to me more like they're delightedly surprised with the
income from player moves rather than seeing it as some sort of expensive,
man-hour intensive chore.

    GM's probably look at it as category 2, if they have anything to do with
it at all, but I imagine they haven't seen much of that "Over $1 million".

Cheers,
James
