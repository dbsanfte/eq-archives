Well, it is possible and I'll clarify since I didn't elaborate and it wasn't 
left very clear.

Regnor - Beta2, Level 24 Mystic/L24 Alchemist (was my main till the end)
Redbeard - Beta1, Level 21 Mystic, Level 18 Scholar (Officer in the guild 
"Testers of Beta" and no, I didn't pick that name)
Kesha - Beta2, Level 15 Rogue, Level 3 Artisan
Winterfury - Beta1, Level 9 Fighter, Level 9 Artisan
Raskolnikov, Beta3, Level 6 Fighter (220%), Level 3 Artisan (<---- probably 
the most fun character)
Herbalist - Beta3, Level 6 Mage, Level 8 Artisan
 ... half dozen or more Herbalist clones, each to limits of the Isle (level 
6), various Artisan 6 through 9
 ... and another half dozen more KeshaB clones, each to the limits of the 
Isle

Isle noobs are fairly easy to level, both in adventuring and artisanship. I 
tried going a variety of paths, sometimes doing every quest I could find, 
sometimes heading straight for the deer and off the Isle at 5. Deer were the 
best for that purpose as they are very easy to kill, provide good experience 
from 4-6, drop many hides and chests for loot, and spawn faster than they 
can be killed in the very first area off the front end of the zone. It's no 
way to enjoy the Isle, but it's the best way to get a new character to town 
as soon as possible to test other things as I could get from new character 
to Qeynos in less than an hour.

There were a number of reasons to test noobs fresh off the Isle. The biggest 
one was the constantly changing tradeskilling content that benefitted from 
starting a new character and watching to see how each would react to the new 
changes on an almost daily basis at the end. This was particularly true of 
the Harvesting changes, where I found and reported bugs related to spawning 
and skill-ups. As you know, existing characters had their harvesting skills 
reset to 10 or 15 while having their wholesale societal tasks set based on 
their adventuring levels, which made it virtually impossible for an existing 
character to complete them. I avoided this problem bu creating new 
characters almost daily, often several daily.

Oh, and by testing all the even con recipes at every level of artisan after 
each change was made, I discovered and reported several cash exploits that I 
might not have found otherwise. It was a pretty instructive process, 
although mind-numbingly boring after a while, but omg there were so many 
things in flux at the end in tradeskilling it was the only way I knew of to 
make sense of them all: by experiencing them.

The character I may have enjoyed the most was Raskolnikov. This guy was 
never intended to hit the mainland, he was a permanent resident of the Isle 
of Refuge. Once he hit the cap of 220% experience, he stopped getting 
experience completely and his sole mission was to continue discovering and 
completing every quest he could find on the Isle. He solo'd the named shark, 
gobbo, bear, spider, skelly, even the Chieftain and his group. The only one 
he was never able to successfully solo was Captain Rockbelly. I tried that 
one three or four times before finally concluding that it was indeed a 
Group-required event. He never even tried to solo the Orc, but did kill him 
probably a half dozen times and had a fun time joining Orc groups.

If you take out the "freebie" levels I got for each character starting on 
the Isle, it's still probably more than 70/50 "earned" levels, dunno, it was 
an approximation I pulled out of memory based on a mental estimation. Kesha 
was 2-boxed as an experiment and several of the artisans were also 2-boxed, 
so you might discount those, too, if you want.

I regret hearing that this came across as my trying to get attention. 
Granted, anyone who puts this amount of time into playing *and* writing 
about a game is probably feeding a variety of complex inner needs. ;-)  But 
the reason I stuck that reference up front was to distinguish my reports 
from others I've read (in connection with many games, not just EQ2) which 
were based on limited in-game experience. I've always tried to quality my 
comments as limited to the levels that I've actually experienced, and the 
reference was simply meant to establish some basis for an informed opinion 
on what followed.
