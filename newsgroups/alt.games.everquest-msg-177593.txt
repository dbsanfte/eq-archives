That's an unjustified over-generalization, which is your fault for
believing that your singular experience holds true for all other
players and servers.  That makes this one of those much ballyhoo'd
"Teaching Moments" where you have an opportunity to finally learn
something your parents (hopefully) have been trying to teach you
since you were about two years old.  Namely that you are <not> the
center of the universe and your experiences and opportunities are
<not> identical to everybody else's.  In my experience it would've
depended on the server being played on and the time of day.  I've
played several servers, and on those where North Freeport was an
active auction zone you could easily get bound there most any time,
on other servers your odds were much much better at the gates,
especially in off-hours when the server pop was low, because most
folk just passed through as fast as they could and never set foot
in North Freeport.

Good for you.  How does that affect somebody who plays on a server
and/or at a time when casters are not hanging around there?

I believe that was her point, or more specificly that the lack of an
option now provided by the Soulbinders wasted her time.  Hell, I can
recall it taking 30 to 60 minutes to get a bind in GFay, where the
bank, the vendors, and the newbie garden are all in the same zone.
