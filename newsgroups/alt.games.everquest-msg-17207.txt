Hey, I saw Jakys in SK this weekend. I would have said hi, but I was
helping a guildmate :-)

Verant has a policy of NEVER admitting they've broken a quest. Hell, there
have been quests that have been broken for years (the 'baby snatching'
quest in Qeynos Hills comes to mind) and Verant still has no official word
on it.

However, the answer is simple: SK always has people in it. No one has seen
these gnolls spawn in several months. NOT ONCE. Therefore, the quest is
broken.
