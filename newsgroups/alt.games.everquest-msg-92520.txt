I love answering questions for true newbies (hell I love answering questions
for anyone).  I don't enjoy hand-holding though...it takes too much time out
of my day.

You're pretty much stuck with doing what everyone else did...trial and
error.  The first 10 hours in EQ going in cold (no friends to call) can be a
bitch and frustrating.  It's not an addicting game until you figure out the
basics so I'd recommend you quit now while you have a chance. :)

Asking questions about game play here is a good resource.

Some tips:
- NEVER EVER ASK FOR ANY ITEM, CASH, OR BENEFICIAL SPELL (buff) FROM
STRANGERS.  Whether someone is a beggar or buff beggar they still suck.
Obviously if you're grouped it's in the group's best interest to keep you
buffed.

- DON'T BITCH/WHINE/COMPLAIN ABOUT VERANT HERE as the central theme to your
post.  We don't care, and chances are we'll tell you we don't care.  Free
Speech definitely rules here, and you have a RIGHT to break this tip, but we
have the right to flame you for it. :)

- DON'T ASK US WHAT RACE/CLASS YOU SHOULD BE.  We aren't mind readers...this
is a game and you have to live with your choice for over a year (almost 3
years for me now)...you'll be a LOT happier making your own decision based
on what "feels right."  I choose gnome whenever I can, including my new
warrior.  He's got serious disadvantages starting out as opposed to an ogre
or troll, but damnit, I like gnomes.
