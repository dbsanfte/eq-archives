Actually we have a currency, the platinum piece. It doesn't have to be
a real object. Look at your paper dollar, a $20 isn't worth more than
a single, in paper. It represents more money though.

We can also have futures in EQ, if we like. We already have loans, it
is just hard to enforce the loan.

There is nothing stopping someone from saying I will buy two stacks of
Viscious (sp?) Mana from you for 15pp each now, deliver them tomorrow.
That sounds like a future to me. If you are not an enchanter, then
that is a speculation, that you can buy the VM before tomorrow for
less than 15pp.

We can extend this ad nauseaum. The more I look at it, the more I am
convinced this is a good teaching tool for capitalism.
