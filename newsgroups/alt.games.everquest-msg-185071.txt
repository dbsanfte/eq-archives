Yes. Level 1 up.

Look for a book on a lectern - there's one near each starting city, and
the PoP manual gives brief instructions on finding each book. Click on
the book to zone to PoK.

Once in PoK, there are obelisks for each zone - click on the obelisk to go
there. All books should be usable at all levels, except the Plane of
Tranquility which requires level 46.

Horses are actually a Luclin addition - you can buy them in the Bazaar.
You can also buy a giant lizard (a drogmor) that acts like a horse
from the lighthouse in the Legacy of Ykesha expansion.
