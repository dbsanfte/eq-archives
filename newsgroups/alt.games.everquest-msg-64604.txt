Your computer is fine.  It is the DX 8 dll file that they are using.  When
the test server came up, it said people could help by switching their dll to
the dx8 version and the text has been messed up everywhere extending beyond
the boxes both in the normal game and in the test server.  Now, after the
patch, we don't have the option of going back to the uncorrupted dll.  It
isn't a big deal but is normal.  I am using a Geforce 2 Pro 64M.  This
should be one of the easier fixes for Verant in view of everything else they
are dealing with.
