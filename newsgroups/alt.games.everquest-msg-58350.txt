There was a computer magazine that had the basic game plus a ten day trial
on the cover last month.

Though in that 10 days you'll have to work fairly hard to make sure you
get above 5th level and actually enter the playing section of the
game...should be enough to tour a bit, interact with a few people and try
out a range f a few character types although unless you pick one and work
it you may have difficulty seeing the full range of the game as im at 26
of 60 levels and still finding new and interesting things to do n amongst
the xp/skills grind at the core of any computer base rpg.
