one caveat - it is not 1.5 times the lowest level, it is 2/3rds the
highest level rounded down.

a 38 gets xp when grouped with a 58 (which would give a false negative
under the 1.5xLowest rule)

This from empirical observation (IE 38 was where I stopped using the 
/pet get lost method of PL'ing and just grouped him with my mage and 
started killing things as fast as possible
