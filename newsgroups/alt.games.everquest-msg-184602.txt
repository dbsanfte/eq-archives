All of these assume you know how to sneak around without getting killed. Sow
and invis are important


All in Luclin:
Bind in the Nexus.
Check out Shadowhaven
Get a port to Twilight Sea -- one of the most beautiful zones in EQ -- but
kills your frame rate.
Run to Katta Castellum-- very cool Goth city
Gate back to Nexus
Try to run thru Netherbian Lair -- if you are careful you can avoid the
mobs -- zone into Dawnshroud Peaks for a quick look but be careful of trains
to zone
Head back into Netherbian and go to Sanctus Seru -- avoid the mobs again and
go to beautiful city of Marus Seru

Kunark is not as nice as Luclin but you can use the POP books to see parts
of it
Take the Overthere book but avoid the Evil outpost - you can run from there
to Skyfire if careful --and if really careful you can run along the zone
wall to Frontier Mountains to see the Giants and even Warsliks Wood.
You can also take the Cabilis book to see Field of Bone and Kurn's Tower.
The Kunark nexus spire will take you Burning Woods to which is usually safe
if you are careful -- you can even head to Dreadlands and  Karnor's Castle
(KC) but don't go past the entrance to KC.
Then if you want you can run to Firiona Vie behind KC or use the POP book
