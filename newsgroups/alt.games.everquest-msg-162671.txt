They can breathe underwater

Yes they most definately can.. There is kind of a trick to it though.. If
you hand an elemental
multiple peices of armor in one trade, then it will only wear one of them..
So
what you need to do is hand the armor to the elemental peice by piece.
Also, unlke pc's elementals can hold more than one lore item.. So you can
give
your elemental a sliglt hp boost by summoning a set of focus items for him..
giving them
to him one by one, then summoning a second set, give them to him, then
summon a third set
for yourself. This is quite time consuming, so I only do it when i plan to
keep a pet for several hours.
here is the full list of equipment i give to my pet. when soloing in one
area and not chain-casting

-2 summoned mystic dagger or sword of runes
-full set of summoned plate mail (except bracers)
- elemental defender
-focus necklace
-2 focus rings
-2 focus earring
-2 focus bracers
-coldstone


After doing this, you will notice a _signficant_ increase in the
survivability of your pet while tanking.

Im not really sure about this one.. But i will say once your pet gets dual
weild, your much
better off giving him two summoned weapons. If your pet cant dual weild yet,
then give him
2 elemental defenders. one for shield slot, and one for back slot. I dont
THINK they will bash
but really not sure.


Another interesting thing is that if you give them a proccing weapon to use,
they will use the proc.
Go ahead and farm up some gnoll hide lariats, ykesha's, daggers of dropping,
serrated bone dirks, any weapons with damage dealing procs.. You can give
them to your pet, for a large dps increase in tough areas.
