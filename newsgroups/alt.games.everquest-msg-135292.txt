He didn't say "when a battle starts going wrong", he said "when a battle 
starts getting hard".  And yes, it IS annoying when you hear your caster 
shout "RUN!" and cast 'gate' while you're standing toe to toe with a mob 
and - oh my god - losing a bit of health.  It's then, when you're no 
longer getting the heals/quickens/mob slows that you need to make sure 
it's *only* a tough battle, that the fight starts to go down the toilet.
