True to an extent.

The legal system isn't *that* complicated, and any citizen ought to have 
a working grasp of the laws, particularly those applicable to oneself, 
particularly if one runs a business and is exposed to the possibility of 
this sort of lawsuit.

But how about a salient reference... would that go a ways towards 
placating you?

In a case of a man who wrenched his knee by slipping in a puddle of 
homogenized, the California Supreme Court has made it much easier for 
injured shoppers to show store owners should have cleaned up hazards. 
Lawyers for retailers worry the court's decision could mean stores 
sometimes will have to prove they didn't cause injuries rather than 
plaintiffs prove the stores did.

Generally, someone who wants to sue a store because he was injured by 
slipping in a spill or tripping over a stray object must prove the 
management knew, or should have known, about the spill or object. That 
is, the plaintiff must prove the defendant store had either "actual" or 
"constructive knowledge" of the hazard. The most common way for a 
plaintiff to show constructive knowledge has been to prove the hazard 
was on the floor for so long that a "reasonable" storeowner, using 
"ordinary care," would have found it and cleaned it up.

In a decision issued a few days before Christmas, however, the Supreme 
Court held unanimously that an injured shopper doesn't necessarily have 
to prove how long a spill had lain around untended. Instead, he can show 
simply that the store had not inspected the area recently. From that, a 
jury may infer the spill had been there too long.

"We conclude that evidence of the owner's failure to inspect the 
premises within a reasonable period of time is sufficient to allow an 
inference that the condition was on the floor long enough to give the 
owner the opportunity to discover and remedy it," the court held.
