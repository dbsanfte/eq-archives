They group outside the guild.  The tags that appear in those groups are
pretty limited for the most part, though there are always random "crossover"
grouping situations that crop up.  Just pointing out that even among guilds
competing for the #1 spot on the server where gear obviously isn't an issue
(Quellious has 3, well 5 if you count alliances separately, that are like 1
or 2 mobs apart in progression) "culture" can prevent intermingling.

You big softy!  Not what I would call a prevalent attitude in modern
society, much less in game.  =)

I know someone that does it with a ranger, which requires just a bit more
insanity...  I've never been there when he does (as me being there would
probably mean I'm the one doing it), but he's the one that clued me in on
the mission and how to do it.  =)

I tend to be a very focused and goal-driven grinder.  I'm either hunting an
item, or I'm buckling down and grinding AAs.  If I'm hunting an item, it can
be a relaxed camp that I will freely walk away from at random when I get
bored and just come back later.  I find I usually get the item just as fast
this way as bulling through and doing the 6-hour stretches waiting for it to
drop.  When I'm grinding AA, watch out because you might start to realize
why I'm called the Mad Monk without the need to see my raid pulling.  I can
go a month without getting an AA (well, not entirely true, I get about 3 a
week purely from raid exp) and then knock out 30+ in a weekend.

You may be right, if talking only about DoN gear, but I know of more than
one person who has switched main characters to a warrior and done fine after
a fairly short time of equipping (all had plenty of platinum to throw at the
problem, which helps).

Also true, as it should be obvious that many guilds, for reasons of
survival, have relaxed their standards to reach down farther into the pool
of potentials.

On my server it was semi-popular again after the revamp (ghost town now, but
that's due to level range of the largest portion of players).

There are varying levels of organized and focused, no doubt.

I was a guild officer, leader, raid leader, lead puller for 6+ years.  Every
guild on my server, including most if not all of the Quellious-native ones,
and many guilds scattered across all other servers has people who "grew up"
under my direction.  I, quite literally, pulled and led a guild from ToV to
Time/GoD.  My current guild, where I have taken a non-leadership position
for the first time, has not one but two *officers* who grew up under my
direction, and the allied guild also has one officer who did so as well, as
well as many members in both.

I don't group with five dorks.  =)

But I do see your point.  Best I can say is work harder.  I did, and I would
never have such a problem, so I know that working harder is good advice.  =)

That's a large part of it.  It's just the inspiration for the actual reason

I have noticed this more in my current guild/alliance, so may be more the
norm.  Wasn't how it worked under me.

That's one reason why former members under my leadership occupy officer
positions in many guilds now.  I trained leaders when I found people who
would be good leaders, something that can only be found when they are given
an opportunity to try it.  I really think there are too few players of my
type left in the game.

See, earlier, re-re-re-reflagging in PoP.  Hell, see being a monk in
general.  Many are the raid targets that offer absolutely no possibility of
personal progression, and I enjoy them all.  =)

Even that guy only maxes at about 6k in a single round, and that's if you
are unlucky.  With strategy and tactics, he never does much damage to
anybody.  Most melee have a riposte disc, so you're unlikely to be there
without at least one person capable of tanking him long enough for the
enchanter pet to destroy him.  =)

It's harder for a tank, just like it's utterly easy for a finger wiggler
(who don't even need the DoNs to be adequate).  That's a different
discussion.  We might even land on the same side in that one.  =)

I would agree.  I would also point out that wiser time management could
probably result in both better rewards and less time expended, without ever
joining a raid.  One can always work harder, or more efficiently, or with a
better plan.

That amount of improvement applies to everyone (who has taken advantage of
what is available).  Mudflation rolls on...  Wanna know how long it took my
first character to get to level 50 compared to how fast I can do it now?  =)

Of course, but not all that far behind.  =)

I think the number of people who can honestly claim to fall into that

There are no uber family guilds.  =P

In an "uber" guild, someone saying they need five other people of specific
classes, screw you beastlords, is understood and not bitched at for being a
selfish bastard.  Though actually, that does seem a bit more familial than
the response one would get in a so-called family guild.  =)

No particular reason.  So you better ask nicely.  =)

I am ~13k hp and WoS is trivial to me.  While waiting for a raid to start in
Anguish I often pop into groups randomly for short times (I'm a fidgety
person, I *need* to be doing something).  I've met more than a few clerics
who, even after I told them that I wasn't at all fragile and please use CH,
were convinced that they were mere seconds away from doom and would spam me
with inefficient quick heals.  If they start out doing that, I expect it
(monks aren't great tanks *until* the stuff is trivial).

If they continue doing that after it becomes obvious that I'm just as good a
tank as any random warrior, that's a lack of skill and/or adaptability. 
There probably is a solution for that, but I'm not gonna try to come up with
it in the 20 minutes before a raid.  =)  If they can't adapt to me when I'm
making it *easier*, they surely don't have the ability to adapt to a tank
that adds difficulty.

Maybe that's it.  The mobs themselves are easier, but due to zone design the
camps are often more difficult.

But now we're talking about perception of need vs. actual need.  Perhaps a
valid discussion, but not one I'm nearly as interested in.  =)

I've watched a SK "turn it on" and both out-dps me and out-tank a warrior,
simultaneously, while needing no heals for a short period.  Handy ability to
have.  =)

By the way, if you haven't already.  Get fearless.  Then ask to tank Inny. 
Your guild will thank you if they aren't already using such a setup.  I used
paladin/SK to tank several Time bosses to great effect, but the biggest
differences were on Inny and CT.

More perception.  More explainable too.  I don't know SK AAs, you don't know
monk AAs, and that guy over there doesn't know warrior AAs, so without the
knowledge to know whether the answer is a good one, you ask a different
question.  Some of this is pure laziness no doubt, but not unexpected.
