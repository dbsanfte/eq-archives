We'll level the chanter to 34 at least first, though. Preferably
get him into 35 too. Send him to OT just to grind safely or
sunnink, I guess.

[How far up the tower can we go?]

Sounds nice, and I bet the cleric wouldn't mind playing undead
wizard, I know I love to do that when I get the chance. And
I think we'll stay at the second floor for a while first, these
guys aren't as used to dungeon adventuring as my "regular" group
(which is weird, these guys are EQ veterans, been playing for a
couple years. That's what soloing necros and druids get ya...)
and we have no evac...

Yeah, I figured 4th would be pushing the envelope until it burst
open, exposing its gooey innards. Had some problems there with
a low-forties group with my main. Bedroom on third, got it.
Someone posted links to some nice ToFS maps some time ago, does
anyone remember the link? Guess I could google for it.

Well, yeah, that's why I asked what level would be needed,
ya know? We'll probably head back to LGuk, and hit CoM
quite a bit before we try something like that.

Good idea, I'll remember that one.

Rune, should be leveling his main, having way too much fun with twinkie.
