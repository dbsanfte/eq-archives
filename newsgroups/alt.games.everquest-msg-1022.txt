The way I see it, Verant doesn't mind the buying/selling.  What do they care
who pays, as long as that $10 comes in.  The reason that they state that
they will ban you is to cover their backsides.

Suppose Verant said it was ok.  Then somebody goes out and pays $1000 for an
account, but the account doesn't come with the gear that was promised.  The
buyer would then whine to Verant that so-and-so ripped them off.  This way
Verant can calmly say "I told you not to do it, *poof* no more account".  By
having this policy, Verant keeps anyone from coming to them with these
issues.

Its just good business sense.
