Like ads at the movies, for example. I mean, people must love them... or
movie theatres would offer alternative showings without them... right?

Companies get rich by offering services that people will put up with because
they don't have a choice, because the companies form monopolies. People may
hate them, but they feel helpless.

Who exactly is the "you" in the " If you want to start a new MMMORPG
tomorrow, you can. "? Bill Gates perhaps? Not many individuals have the dosh
to develop, market, mantain a MMORPG.

Hundreds of channels controlled by how many companies? If there were a
billion channels but they were all owned by Rupert Murdoch, would you say
that was a triumph of the free market?Or perhaps the term "cartel" is more
accurate, is that a triumph of the free market as well? Like when OPEC
created the Oil Shock?

After all, if oil gets too expensive, you can always just stop using it.
