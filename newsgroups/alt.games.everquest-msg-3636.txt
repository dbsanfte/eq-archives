I took my Barbarian warrrior to Qeynos for the first time last night and
found the PvP Arena (Grounds of Fate) there to be between me and the Warrior
class hall.  Lots of people happened to be there beating the crap out of
each other at the time, and me being only lvl 7 and ready to log out I
didn't bother to stick my head in!  So, I'm wondering if you have to cross
the PvP area to get to Qeynos' warrior guild.  Don't have time to play right
now so thought I'd ask on here and be prepared this evening.

 BTW you can call me chicken if you want to; when everybody in a PvP area
cons red to me I'll just be over here peckin' corn!

Chris
