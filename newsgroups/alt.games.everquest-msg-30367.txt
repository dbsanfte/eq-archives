I have no idea who he is...at least I didn't until I did a search and
started to read the transcript of a show of his with Steven Wright, Ben
Afleck and couple of Christians (with opposing views on Jesus) and I am now
being given funny looks by people in my office.

Obviously the logistics to getting the rest of Europe's roads to conform to
ours would be an absolute nightmare and we can't really expect them to
change all their cars to Right Hand Drive, just wouldn't be fair on poor
Johnny Foreigner. So, they'll just have to put up with it when they come to
blighty. That's what you call good will to your neighbours and people call
us xenophobic, pah!

I know what you said and meant. I never had a problem with it, other than I
read it twice :ï¿½P
I agree with it, I don't actually care what side is decided but fior
arguements sake, right. Then should the same go for Dreadlands when zoning
to KC for safety? Zoning right would mean you zone into the medding crowd
and so are safe BUT that would mean that if the medding/saftey crowd want to
zone out they may find a Ravager on the other side waiting for them and
Zoning left would put you into a possible Karnor's train...think I'll take
my chances with the Drolvargs.

Actually my post was just meant to be a pedantic dig but, having re read it
I can't really defend it in the way you've taken it, fucked if I'm going to
apologise for it, tho'

CF
Actually after reading some of that Bill Mahr show, I may apologise...when
I've finished.
