I spend enough time in a given workday worrying over code.  I'm content to
let the folks who're getting paid to do it at SOE worry over thiers.  I know
that it irritates the crap out of me when users back-seat drive a decision I
made that was for their benefit, so I'm reticent to back-seat drive someone
else.

If they make the decision that the servers need to come down in prime time,
and they're willing to catch the heat for that decision (and they know good
and well that if they drop the server in prime time it'll get warm), then by
all means drop 'em.

Just as easy to go read a book.
