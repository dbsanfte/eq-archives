I like the forceful use of capital letters.  Shows authority.  Too bad you
have none here.

If I seem a bit irritated by it, I've spent the entire day dealing with
people trying to impose authority they don't have.

Order of the Mallet
--

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
