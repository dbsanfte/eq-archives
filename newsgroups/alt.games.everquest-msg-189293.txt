I heard that the folded medicine bags will fit inside another bag.
I've also heard that they don't work for all potions.  I looked on the
web for details but I guess they are too new.  So what's the deal with
these bags?  Do they offer anything such as an alchemy boost?  And how
are they made?

thanks,

Robert
