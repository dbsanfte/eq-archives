EQ playability was a big factor in my recent notebook purchase. I
bought a Toshiba Satellite 5105-S607. It came with P4-M 1.7GHz, 512MB
DDR RAM, GeForce4 Go 440 32MB DDR video and a 40GB 5400rpm HDD. It
runs EQ very nearly as well as my desktop (P4 1.8MHz, 512MB RDRAM,
GeForce3 64MB DDR, 80MB IDE RAID-0 drive array) with all options
cranked up. I believe one of the primary factors is the 5400rpm HDD.
The hard disk tends to be a bottleneck still for laptop computers.

I would highly recommend this notebook to any EQ fan. Price was $2495.
