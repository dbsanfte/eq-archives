|Any forum about warrens tactics?

	This zone is completely useless except as a source of faction.

	It's too densely packed and respawns too quickly to be fought in casually.
It was intended to be played using the same raid protocols you use in
high-level play.  This makes the zone suitable for no one, as newbies don't
have the skill and no one will do that kind of work for a level 14 character;
might as well go hit Kael instead.
