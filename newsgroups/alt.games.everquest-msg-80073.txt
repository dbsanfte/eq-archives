Might be a reference (though waaaaay obscure) to the punk band. Not sure
if it's the exact spelling, but close. Why, at my age, I even know of
the *existance* of such a band is a mystery. My only defense is that I
correspond with a lot of people and we get into frequent sidebar
discussions. Personally, my involvement with punk music stopped at the
Sex Pistols and the selling out of Billy Idol.
