Ah, look at the egos coming out now. :-) If it were just that, no one
would have ever brought it up. But some people *cough* seem to drone
on and on, post links of their best gear at least twice a night,
"reverse complaining" like slapfish mentioned, or just plain old
outright demonstrations of how much better they think they are over
everyone else.

I never thought Martin was really doing anything on purpose. But some
other people have way too much of themselves wrapped up in their in
game persona. What a psychiatrist would think of that I hesitate to
speculate.

:-)

P.S. those who really are the shit don't have to constantly rag about
it to convince others....
