Wow! I've been killfiled! LOL!!

I'll admit that perhaps the bitter, lonely misogynist line is a touch on 
the edge. But I've seen enough abuse cases professionaly, personally, 
and just knowing the folks involved to see a lot of flags going all over 
the place with this guy. I'm just going to have to walk away from this 
thread. Reminds me way too much of the Nazi breeding program, and of 
course whenever someone has to drag Nazis into the thread, it ought to 
be ignored.

And now back to EQ. Any one else out there not able to log onto EQ since 
GoD's release? Been talking to tech support and I'm getting NO 
assistance that actually works.
