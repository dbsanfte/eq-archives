wtf you think we're gonna do with all that pH@+  l3w+ ?

sell it to a vendor?  Yeah, I get irritated when I see other (level 1) bards
in full lambent while I'm still in bronze/banded.  But hey - do they last?
Nope.  Most of the crap you find on monsters is NOT decent for your same
level.  ie, you get a sword off a 27-30 mob, it's practically useless to you
at that same level - whereas a level 5 alt can get some MAJOR use out of it.
