Hee hee hee.  I hear that a lot of this happened when the Iksar first came 
out, though the male and female Iksar are more differentiated than the 
Frogloks.  The main thing I noticed about Frogloks is that the males have 
much brighter, more vibrant colors than the females -- which fits, since in 
the animal kingdom it's usually the males who are the prettiest and most 
show-offy.

That, and the male Frogloks are entirely bare-chested when naked, whereas 
the female ones have a bit of a top tunic thingy.  Dunno why... it's not 
like they have frogboobies or anything.

Nobody *ever* mistakes genders in Vah Shir, though.  Wonder why!  ;)
