I was in City of Mist from 35 - 41. A little early, and at first i didnt get
my share of the exp, because i was maybe 2 or 3 level to low. I normally
grouped with players from 40-50. I got my maddest exp when i - at 37 -
grouped (full group) with a lvl 51 ranger. Very fast killing... Shamans are
of course welcome, because of slow, speed, buffs and heals.. I couldnt
effectivily slow at first, because mobs were TO red. But later on, it really
make a differnce, having a shaman in the party.

So - from 35-41 there. Only won roll on a Firerune Brand and 1 WBHammer. GJB
dropped, so did lost staff of the scorned. Never saw a wu, though.

From 41-46 where i am now, i ventured through Crystal Caverns, Eastern
Wastes, Dreadlands. And lately i have been in CoM again... it is quite
boring now, though, since i know all the places where a pre-50 can go... and
hunt. But that also makes it a very safe hunting place for me.

I will soon go to Karnors Castle, Kaesora, Skyfire. I *hate* places like
Lower Guk and Sol B. Confusing, overcamped and farmed and very dangerous...
too dangerous for a safe-player like me =) Besides, i dont go places where
my pet cant follow me around easily...

Btw - If Crystal Caverns isnt to high for you, that is a *great* zone. And
even a bank in the buttom of the zone. Beware the orcs though. The first
kill i made in that zone dropped Crystal Covered Shroud lol. 1k in da pockat
=) Next kill was a herbalists who dropped that herbalists bag, who has 10%
weight reduction.

Now im 4 bubs into 46. And have really stepped off the hyped "fast-exp
train". Now im having fun. Adventuring... helping newbies in all zones to
have nice stats, speed and haste on. Handing out the armour that only sells
for a few plat to the merchants, anyway. Bronze, ruined scale from CoM
(looks very cool.. dark green, my cleric loves it. no stats though, so its
not too much twinking IMHO) and perhaps a few weapons too. Have been killing
spectres in Oasis, Giants in FM etc...

On to the game =)
