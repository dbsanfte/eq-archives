The Guild I am in we try to get a arena event going every second Saturday,
and for the players that don't like too Duel (Not many that I know of) we
have 1 section for Language Lessons & another section for Trivia, most of
the players end up at the triva section for most of the night.  The reson we
have it every 2 weeks is that it gives everyone that wants to go a break
from straight LvLin and Raids, we usually have a very good turn out at them
all.
