At least on Torv*, Sebilis is completely devoid of pickup action and
Velk's is more for the 55+ crowd. If you want a pickup group at 51-54,
you go to Karnor's, Chardok or, more recently, Fungus Grove.

Banishing level 60s from a zone doesn't magically make more under-60
groups show up. It just makes zones empty.
