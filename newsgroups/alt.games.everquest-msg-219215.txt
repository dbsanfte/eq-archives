Moopy addressed this to some degree as well but I think its important enough
to merrit additional consideration.
The major reason for using 2hs over dual wield is to reduce riposte damage.
The reason that so many rangers tank so poorly is that they insist on dual
wielding fast weapons and then wonder why they take so much damage. Now
admittedly there are some mitigation issues at play however Riposte is a
major issue especially in PoP where the mobs hit so damn hard. In a way
using a War Marshal's over a windblade only exacerbates the problem you are
trying to address.
The WMBS is a 31/28 weapon which means its hitting alot almost double the
number of attacks as a windbalde with its 50/45.
The most important thing to remember about riposte's is that its the targets
damage potential that is realized not the weapon in use. So while the WMBS
may do marginally better dps you'll be taking almost double the number of
Riposte's as you would with the Blade. And each hit made by the attacker
provides an oportunity for a riposte so more attacks means more oportunities
for a riposte.
This is where the Windblade and other high delay weapons win out few swings
mean few oportunities for riposte's which means less damage to the tank. The
higher damage also means that the tank lands bigger riposte's which are tied
not to the tanks delay but the targets.
The as an added bonus the slower weapons are less deadly in the case of
enrage and with mobs hitting as hard as pop mobs do means that a moment of
inatention with a fast weapon set up or a little lag can melt your tank in
the last seconds of engagement. The slower weapons while not negating that
problem do reduce the severity of it.
When just consentrating on DPS from behind a mob the WMBS may win out
slightly in the damage dept but the diference seems to be rather modest and
the advantages for when the mob turns or the tank drops outweigh the
increased damage IMO.
A final point in the Windblades favor is the extra AC and while it may be a
minor advantage and you will get tons of debate over the value of AC every
bit does help. Perhaps not a lot individually but a little bit hear and
there can make the difference in how much damage the tank is taking
depending on the mobs relative atk.
For Knights the slower harder hitting weapons are a no brainer as far as I'm
concerned. Their strength is in tanking and they serve their groups best if
they consentrate on that str rather than trying to increase their dps.
The relative advantages of the two weapons are quantified by their values.
Windblades go for 5 to 10k more than WMBS's and that should tell you all you
need to know as far which is the superior choice.
So to wrap this up. My advice would be to go Windblades and save the extra
inventory slot for loot.
