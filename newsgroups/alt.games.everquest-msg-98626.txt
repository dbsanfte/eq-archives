I picked up the new summon corpse at the Paineel Shadowknight guild.  It
cost about 20pp with ally faction (after I remembered to take off all my
negative charisma items).  The same vendor also sells the coffins, which
aren't stackable, but also aren't containers.  The coffins cost about 31 or
32pp.
