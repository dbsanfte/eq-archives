This is pretty much what I gathered. I read both sides of the story and no
matter how I looked at it...it just seemed that CT was wrong on both counts.
Most likely because xanapox's arguement was so childish and self righteous.
I really should have kept my mouth shut but when I saw him start whining
because FoH did the exact same thing to him, I just couldn't stop myself. My
bad...I apologized and walked away. This was very useful for me...although
our guild is small...we're all starting to hit the high lvl's at the same
time and are looking forward to bigger raids and ubermobs. Whether it be
just our guild of 20-25, or joining up with another guild to get the job
done. Now I know that we need to start looking for some type of calendar or
organization for our server, so this doesn't happen to us.

thx info
