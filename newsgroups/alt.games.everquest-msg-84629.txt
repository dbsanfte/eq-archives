And somehow, immediately, this turns into a dickwaving contest about
who's a better "expert" on guild communications? *sigh*. (And remember,
we're talking about *GUILD* communications which have different needs
and modes of operation than RL. Fine. Let's compare.
Bizbee: Has stated that he as <never> been and <will never> be a member
of <any> guild. Experience in Guild communications? Appears to be zero
to me.

Jazz: Between Warrior, Monk, Wizard, and Necro, a combined 128 levels of
being in guilds, with three positions as officer and one as Raid Leader
and Coordinator. Hrmmm.... you make the call.

Yep. And in rare cases, there's an exception for it that any
_reasonable_ person would understand and forget about the matter. (e.g.
went on a Fear raid last night with an ally guild, told us was turning
of /gu, forgot to turn it on today. No biggie.) That's very different
from the asshole who *never* has it on because they think anything being
said by the rest of the guild is "blather" unless <they> need something
right then.

Couple of interesting points there, Biz. So you would "be there", huh?
How many Ragefire camps did you do prior to the recent change? They can
go on for up to a week. The whole guild would <know> about it and be
prepared, but the *ONLY* people who would "be there" the whole tedious
time would be the cleric and a rotating crew of their closest, most
devoted friends. You don't tie up three dozen post fifty mains non-stop
for up to a week to sit in an empty cave and pull three stupid FG's
every hour or so. At best you have those mains camped there, and they're
off playing alts, or offline but ready for a phone call, etc.  But for
the online ones, having /gu turned on is still the fastest, and really
the *only* way your'e going to get assembled before Rage is taken. Rage
is only one example of course. This scenario applies to a whole slew of
things.

And I see you're still hung up on the whole "port bitch" and "taxi
driver" thing. If you find a guild like that, where everyone really
treats the porters like that, you *should* leave, because they'll never
get much further than raiding the orc camps in S. Ro. We have more than
half a dozen post fifty druids in our guild. And when we log on and need
to go someplace else, yes, the first thing we do is a /gu "Anybody
porting? We're heading to GD" (or wherever). The standard convention is
that if any of the druids or wizards aren't busy and feel like doing it,
they /gu "Sure. Meet me at xxx ring/spires in five."  If they are not,
they either say nothing, or just say /gu I would, but I'm in a good Seb
Jail group now, sorry."  And nobody bats an eye. I take the spires up
and down, or pay for ports, or just plain *walk* plenty, and it's never
a problem.

Again, I've never heard of a guild that bad that made it past the
Mistmoore raiding stage. Maybe it's differnent on Tunare. *shrug*

Again, you're in a rowboat with no paddles here. Obviously you'd be
aware of all the *planned* stuff and be ready for it. But a lot of the
coolest things that happen in the guilds I've been in are spur of the
moment. You've also mentioned that you travel /Anon a lot. (Apologies if
that's incorrect, but I seem to recall that.) So if you are online, have
/gu off, and are Anon so you don't even show up on a /who all GUILD,
then how the fuck will you know when something hot is about to go down?
Anwer: You won't... no matter how much you "keep up on guild
activities."

"When" you wanted to play with them? Wouldn't all the "mindless blather"
drive you "insane" in the meantime?

Again, the whole "port bitch" thing. If that's your picture of what a
typical high end guild is like, I feel sorry for your in game
experiences to date, because you've run into some shitty ones.

Translation: Held a different opinion than you, expressed it without
calling you names, degrading your mother, etc. Asked follow up
questions. Yeah, real "ape shit" there. I might be pushing ape shit
*now* since you decided to drop into dickhead mode after one post, but
it didn't start that way.

Answered in a previous post in this thread. The difference is fucking
night and day. I *know* you aren't that fucking stupid, so you're just
going into "mouse in the corner" mode. It's obvious what the difference
is, and it's huge.
