Wait till the snare wears out :)

You are welcome to go to Hate alone <snicker>.

No, but you gotta love the DE goons posted right next to the Wizzie tp in WC,
wich although it is nothing to your exalted high-level selves is a concern for
teh vast majority of players. And considering that all a druid has to do is camo
the victim...err...customer before tping it is no big deal (same goes for a
Wizzie tping to WC). there is a workaround for everything.

More people get SOW more often than those that travel to Air or Hate.

SOW the wizard. We are talking group situations, after all, not even considering
the sow potions you mentioned previously yourself. I have yet to argue with
anyone who has ever told me, "only an idiot would pull without sow."

You don't always want to be pulling singles. Well, I don't, but then I regularly
quad-kite.

What percentage of zones have skeletons, much less ones that loot bone chips?
(rhetorical) Thus, even a necro is doing a little walking frequently, and it's a
lot faster to buy 3 stacks of soemthign than to hunt them down or wait for
someone to respond to "WTB stacks of bone chips"

Wanna bet? I don't even have to ask someone else to win. Worst case with bone
chips is having to hunt them yourself, at 0-2 per mob, once you get to where they
are, at 0 exp each.

10? that's not a pull, that's a rout.

So pull with a level 1 (?) offensive spell. if you are pulling with a magician,
which is laughable.

You have based several ratings on a certain class having a certain item.

Slightly? Maybe if that cleric is wearing cloth armor. most clerics I have seen
even at 20 are better-adorned than the average ranger, much less druid.

Is that worth the 59 levels you have to get through to get it?

If you keep it maxxed (who hasn't gotten sick of every monk gagging and falling
over next to then during any period of downtime?) it's not that negatively
affected, except against mobs 4-5 levels above the monk.

That's fine for L60 rogues. More than 99% of all rogues are not level 60.
