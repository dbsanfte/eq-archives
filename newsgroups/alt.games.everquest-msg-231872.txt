The people who set the limits set them for the worst possible situation: 
a large truck, driving at night, in the rain, in traffic.

This isn't a bad thing, because if they set it higher, say at what would 
be equally safe to do in a sports car during the day when its bone dry 
and there isn't a car in sight...people wouldn't go any slower at night 
in the rain...

I still maintain cops have better things to do than chase the 'villains' 
who push the posted speed limit in optimal conditions.

75mph is fast all by itself, never mind adding it to the posted limit... 
I can't see a justification for going that fast almost any 
circumstances. 25mph otoh... I can think of a zillion places where I 
could add 25mph and have it be perfectly safe... unless its dark and 
raining......

Yep. Theres a stretch of highway nearby that's 90km/h (between a 
mountain and the ocean), except a mile before town it drops to 50km/h, 
and after that mile it becomes a regular city street. Now everybody (and 
I mean everybody) sails past that sign at 90 but are doing 50 long 
before that mile is up... but every time a cop is low on quota he sits 
on the sign and pulls people decelerating to the new limit of 50 but who 
are still at 65 or 75.

Guess everybody drives like idiots, and the whole lot of us should have 
our licenses revoked...

It rarely has to do with an inability to read the sign.
