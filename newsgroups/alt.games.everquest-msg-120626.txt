OK.  Now let me ask you this.  Consider if the punishment had been
appropriate . . . if, for example, the guilty party had gotten drunk (a very
bad thing to do on this particular deployment, and pretty much all others
for that matter).  Now, if it were shown or just accepted that none of us
had known where this individual was during the commision of the offence, as
was in fact the case when the phone call was made, should we be subject to
punishment under those circumstances?

The only difference here, mind you, is that, in case the person had snuck
off and gotten drunk, they would definitely be due punishment.  But would
the people in his temporary barracks who knew no more than that he was going
out for a walk?  And if we were due punishment, why should our senior
leaders, who lived in the same building on that deployment, be exempt from
the punishment, as they were in the real life case I described originally.
Because the definition of "team" regarding collective punishment is
arbitrary.  Otherwise, the entire Armed Forces should be punished equally
for every individual's infraction.  We are all one big team, are we not?

I saw many, many situations like the hypothetical above.  Sometimes, the
squad was punished, sometimes the platoon.  I once was in the front leaning
rest position for about ten minutes with a little over 1000 fellow soldiers
because someone pissed the Colonel off.  I had, as said before, nothing to
do with the offense, and took no good lessons away from those experiences.

Having said this, I believe we have spent enough time on this topic,
interesting discussion though it is.  Whatever your response, I will read
it.  But I will not post a rebuttal to it.  As they say on one of those
debating programs on TV, "You have the last word."
