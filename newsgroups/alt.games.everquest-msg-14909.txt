VI knows they were in the wrong but refuse to  let everyone else find out
they knew. In fact  the e mails that were posted on the EQ site were
severely edited (surprise, surprise). It seems good old Brad offered to let
them "buy" back their guild in exchange for all the loot they had gotten
from the warders. Can we say extortion?
And much like prenuptual agreements, verain't's EULA wouldn't stand up in a
court of law. They all (software co's) make "agreements" like that to
intimidate people and make them think they don't have any legal recourse
when the co's screw them over.
