"Except" you stated that you would pull exactly like me.  So "if" I start at
100 mana and you start at 100 mana, the first time my cleric dips below 80
mana I pull ahead in pulling because the *only* way you can actually be
arguing with me is if you stick to your style of playing.  Otherwise you're
willing to pull at less than 80 mana and have no business arguing with me.

"If" I start at 80 mana and you start at 100 mana, the first time my cleric
dips below 60 mana I pull ahead in pulling because the *only* way you can
actually be arguing with me is if you stick to your style of playing. 
Otherwise you're willing to pull at less than 80 mana and have no business
arguing with me.

"If" I start at 50 mana and you start at 100 mana, the first time my cleric
dips below 30 mana I will pull ahead in pulling because the *only* way you
can actually be arguing with me is if you stick to your style of playing. 
Otherwise you're willing to pull at less than 80 mana and have no business
arguing with me.

Is that clear enough?  Or are you going to come back and say "but, but, but,
the *difference* is that we're playing exactly the *same*" again?
