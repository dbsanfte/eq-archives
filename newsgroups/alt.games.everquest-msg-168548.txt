Com�mu�nism
 n. 1.A theoretical economic system characterized by the collective 
ownership of property and by the organization of labor for the common 
advantage of all members.
    2.Communism
        a.A system of government in which the state plans and controls the
          economy and a single, often authoritarian party holds power, 
          claiming to make progress toward a higher social order in which 
          all goods are equally shared by the people.
        b.The Marxist-Leninist version of Communist doctrine that advocates
          the overthrow of capitalism by the revolution of the proletariat. 

So�cial�ism
 n. 1.Any of various theories or systems of social organization in which
the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by 
a centralized government that often plans and controls the economy.
    2.The stage in Marxist-Leninist theory intermediate between capitalism
and communism, in which collective ownership of the economy under the 
dictatorship of the proletariat has not yet been successfully achieved. 

So I'd say the difference is that communism is a mythical beast, while 
socialism is what actually happens.

Just for completeness,

Cap�i�tal�ism
n. An economic system in which the means of production and distribution
are privately or corporately owned and development is proportionate to the 
accumulation and reinvestment of profits gained in a free market.
