AH ok. Yeah that sounds more right.. 50 to 51.. YES that is DAMN way
better than middle of 51 to 52. 51 WAS PURE HELL ON EARTH. 50 to 51
WAS CAKE. Wow that would be SO COOL of verant if that was true. I'd
quit trying to get beyond the first bubble of 55 and just rack up some
points fast.

Ahh ok that makes sense too, that the better skills might cost several
points. THNX INFO!!! ;)
