I don't recall that bit. All I recall is they had logs of the
conversation among the guild. I don't recall a single mention of the
GM communicating over the guildchat.

The fact that they've been unable to act without /reports of abusive
language in /guildchat tells me that they can't. As a matter of fact,
all the evidence I've seen suggests that, while they can pull up logs
of guildchat, the logging has to be activated and is not constant,
either....
