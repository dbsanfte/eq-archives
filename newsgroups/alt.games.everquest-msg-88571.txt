One of my chars zoned int Velks last evening and was promptly tossed
out to the desk top. I spent several hours trying to get back into the
game, but could not. I did everything all these post recommended with
no luck. I finally got a friend to log my char on, he did,
successfully, walked me out of Velks, Logged. I logged back on ,
successfully, and have been fooling around in GD and Trurg most of the
day. Zoned into and out of Thurg several times with noproblems.A
guildie to me to de-check the Human stuff under options at start up to
prevent this business of being kicked out. I have do so , but have not
tried to zone into Velks yet. I am back to the 2311 drivers.
