The only infrastructure i want or need is that which provides for the common
defense , and secures the rights of the people. EVERYTHING else goverment
tries to do with my money is questionable at best and downright theft most
of the time. If you need additional services from goverment then pay for
them with use taxes. Gasoline taxes do not offend me if the full proceeds go
to roads, I do not mind a tax levied on food to pay inspectors to keep it
safe, etc.

It of course isnt the immorality, or unjustness that is most egregious . It
is that it punishes people for working hard and rewards people for being
lazy and useless. You get less of the conduct you punish and more of what
you reward. People working harder produce income with no direct need for it
. This income is called investment capital . Investment capital is how we
increase our effeciency in production and the ONLY way we do so. If you
steal it then your economy does not grow as fast. We each of us get some
small share of the overall production for our work. The net result is that
our bad tax policy has slowed our economy by a vast amount over the past 50
years . I know that my income purchases half of what it should ( I am twice
as poor) because of this. It is hard to get people to realize this since
they cant even tell you how much money they make each week . They only know
how much they 'take home' . Of course if they ever do realize how much of
their future has been stolen they will want vengeance and this absolutely
terrifies the socialists ( thus the schools that fail to teach ) .
