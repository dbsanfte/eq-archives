This is quite possibly the funniest sour grapes post I've seen in a long 
time!  He uses a third-party hack to hose his EQ installation... and he 
even knows what he did wrong to screw it up, but oh no it's not HIS fault, 
it's not even the hack's fault - it's EQ's!   What a rube...

"Atrocity is recognized as such by victim and perpetrator alike, by all
who learn about it at whatever remove. Atrocity has no excuses, no
mitigating argument. Atrocity never balances or rectifies the past.
Atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-
perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
