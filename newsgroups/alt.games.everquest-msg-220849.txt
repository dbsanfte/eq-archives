Tiru is a grumpy old dwarf, and a terrible weakness for the ladies. He 
can't help it. He likes them wood elf chicks. He also knows he's too old 
to be taken seriously. He drinks heavily when not on a religious errand, 
and that is usually when he is working on cleansing Norrath, or doing 
other sacraments (tending to the dead and performing weddings). He acts 
accordingly. Lots of ayes and yers sprinkle his conversation, but Common 
is fine. He's delighted to listen in on the darker conversations, as 
they help him prepare for what is coming. And he's always loved to work 
with his hands at the forge, like his daddy did before him.

Tarre is pretty emotionally distant. Thin the herd of the weak is her 
motto, whether you are killing relatives in Neriak, or stretching the 
limits of one's abilities by taking on an_uber_mob01. Flirting just 
doesn't really register. She was cursed by her adopted uncle to enter 
into a caring a supportive family, and it burns that she cannot injure 
these people. So she helps them out with not visible sign of resentment. 
Yet if any suggest she is weak, she will return their barbs, and 
threaten to turn their hide to bind her next book. She is very self 
sufficient, and prefers to make everything she needs, instead of 
purchasing the skills of others. She is proud of her rune-embroidered 
shawl, as much as she resents the uncle that prohibits her from harming 
dwarves. She will swerve to kill an elf though, just because she knows 
how much he loves them. She does not bother with Dark or Drow speech, or 
pidgin languages- if she must communicate, there is no point to wasting 
time arguing with translations. Unless of course, she is home. Then she 
will only speak the language of her elders.

My gnome mages talkreallyreallyfast and don't usually 
botherstoppingforbreath because gnomesarefullofenergy and hyperkinetic. 
You want earplugs around her. Gnomes R fun. She'll talk in whatever 
language appeals.
