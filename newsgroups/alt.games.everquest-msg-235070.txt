I experienced this last night with my Bezerker.  I had to find another
hunting ground.  I'm perfectly fine with lowbies wearing cloth armor
and working their way up like so many of us did in years past.  Now, I
do agree with what the OP said in regards to upgrading from one No
Drop item to another.  The item that was replaced is still good, but
most likely it will have to be destroyed because you could eventually
run out of space in your bank because of all the good no drop gear you
may earn.  I think more items should have level requirements instead
of recommendations.
