Good ideas thanks. I've been living in Dragon Necropolis of late which 
remains popular among level 80s I note who probably want Zlandicar or 
perhaps like me, a willsapper for an alt. My little sk is camped in 
Zlandicar's lair which I had the good fortune of clearing solo. It was also 
fortunate the little SK was there as he dropped two Cowl of Mortality, one 
Zlandicar's Heart, one Zlandicar's Talisman. That was quite a haul for one 
kill. It was good fortune the little SK was there as the Cowl is lore. I've 
looted a number of nifty old twinks like a sword that procs a long blindness 
and attack debuff, Chetari staff, cloak, etc. Now if I could just my mitts 
on Vaniki but no....
