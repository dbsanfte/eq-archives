	Exactly.  I got tired of having push a regular mouse all over
the desk in order to get the cursor to go where I wanted it to.  Made
it really difficult to play games, IMO.  With the trackball, the mouse
stays still and I just have to move the ball around.  It also doesn't
get dirty as easily either.
