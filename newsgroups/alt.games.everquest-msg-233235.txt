Can anyone help me work out how the one way door system works and how you
get to the part of the sewers on the other side of these doors?
I have only approached and entered by swimming in and up therefore am not
aware of any other entrance.
I am doing my Enchanter Epic so need to kill Vessel Drozlin in the sewers.
Unfortunately this mob runs through these doors when he gets down on health
and I dont want to lose him. He is high MR so probably can't be rooted. (At
least he doesn't gate).
Also will invis be enough to get my party in through the zone or will I have
to project illusions on all of them?

Thanks

Ian
