Not only that, but we only knew where he would be because we
had cracked the Japanese codes and often ended up reading
their messages before the intended recipients did.

Plus, Yamamoto was a stickler for punctuality, so when
one of the coded messages said that his plane would travel
from X to Y at such-and-such a time and land at such-and-such
a time, we knew *exactly* where he'd be and when.

But the location was still at the extreme range of our
fighters.  So we had only one shot at him, we didn't
have any spare fuel for hanging around after arrival,
or going hunting for his plane.  We simply thrust our
planes over the ocean, stretched them to their range
limit, and got there exactly at the same time as Yamamoto.

And shot him down, demoralizing the entire Japanese
armed forces, who nearly worshipped the man.

Indeed.
