Err, the final Tynn bracer are a GREAT monk bracer. You should try to 
look at the stats, sure you havent just looked at the wrong one?
These are the stats on it, a GREAT monk bracer:

Shackle of Tynnonium
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP
AC: +12 Str: +10 Sta: +10 Agi: +10 Magic Resist: +10 HP: +25
Weight: 0.1
Classes: Monk
Races: Iksar Human
Inventory Slot: Wrist



And as for doing the part where you need to get a item from OT outpost, 
thats some of the fun of the quest. And not at all hard to do. I did it 
at level 24. You need 1 carnelion (to trade with the gargoyle), and 2 
invis potions, thats all. Go to OT and go near outpost. Find the 
Gargoyle tunnel, guarded by 2 gargoyles in outside end, and 2 or 3 
gargoyles at the other end, including Tektite, the guy you need. Use 
invis potion, and go behind the first 2 gargoyles, and into the tunnel. 
Go to other end and stand behind Tektite. Sneak, THEN drop invis (cant 
trade with invis). Then give him carnelion and get his eye. If all goes 
well, you invis again and go out. If it dont, you run back out, anD try 
madly to FD on the way. If any case, the CR just need 1 invis potion, or 
a friendly invis caster that can go near the area.
And if you think thats bad, you probably dont even wanna think about 
going up and do handin to CT in Fear for the Whistling Fist, that you 
need the Tynn shackle to do.

And youll never be powerfull enough to go into the outpost with your 
monk, its called faction, work all over the game, if youre KOS, you 
either get better faction, or need invis or FD flopping to go into town.

Look at stats on bracer. Compare with human sash and headband. They look 
like same class of item? Nope, right.
The sashes are part of epic, and because of that every monk who want 
epic need to do it, INCLUDING iksar monks that will have problems doing 
it. Luckily theyre tradeable, so can get a mule to do the quest.

Also, the sash and headband are easy, can be done at level 35 solo (i 
guess, were higher when i did it), whereas the Shackles are a 
progressive quest, starting at level 1 where your ikky monk start out 
getting the first one, and then through quest upgrade it all the way 
through his career, and somewhere in his fifties might get the Tynn 
Shackle (with a buffer for 1 fight, and a little luck on which subquest 
you get), a well equipped level 51 monk can solo it.
Also, after getting it, you can use it to do the Whistling Fist quests, 
which are doable by 1 group for the nastier fights, rest soloable, 
including the mad FD flopping though a full pop of Fear to do handing to 
Cazik-Thule, WITHOUT getting aggro from anything, since that means 
instant death since he assist whatever aggro you (ikky monks not KOS to 
him, but to everything else, human monks gotta use sneak to get behind 
him). The 3 hours i spend on doing the handin to him are by far the most 
exiting quest i done in EQ so far.
