Yeah, I wasn't pressured (unless you wanna call numerous
and frequent tells even though I was marked AFK pressure)
but I can see the potential for it.

We have a 250 tinker who sells his geerloks for well under
the 'going rate'. I've talked to him a couple of times (I
pick up geerloks at good prices and pass the good prices
on to guildmembers or, in the case of *really* good deals,
donate the geerloks to our guild vault) and he's still
skilling up on some of them, but his prices are still
giving him a slight profit. If someone is satisfied with
their profit, what can you do?

But, then you have the 'bad' version of this. Someone who
is willing to lose money for a while, in hopes that every-
one else will drop out of the business and leave them with
a monopoly. I really don't see how that could work over
long-term though with so many people in the game.

I can see where it's annoying and unavoidable. Maybe in
a few months, I'll be here complaining about that very
thing. LOL

Tracey

For some items, that can kill the market quickly.

Nothing that can really be done about it - but it's still frustrating. 
Someone on our server is selling Gauz presses for less than the cost of 
the mana battery it takes to make them.
