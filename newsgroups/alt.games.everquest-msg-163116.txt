Unfortunately, it doesn't always get better at higher levels.

I was MA on a Hate raid today, and several people had to be
booted from the raid because they simply could *NOT* manage
to a) assist on me instead of attacking a mob at random,
and b) attack a mob only when I gave the "attack now" signal (in
raid channel *and* /ooc).

This was despite halting the raid several times to explain
what they were doing wrong and how to do it right.

It ain't rocket science.
