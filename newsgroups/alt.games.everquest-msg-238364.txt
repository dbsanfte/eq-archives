Seems like too much effort, we had zero problems with adds at the port in
area. (was a group of 5 65's though)

Remember the deathtouching boss spawns around 60mins after you kill the
first mob on this island.

He is a fun kill with just 5 :) Took him down in 31 seconds (he deathtouched
twice, second person to be DT (as we planned) dropped as the boss did).

/hug trueshot + rogue dps :p
