I've been reading a lot on the mobs in The Hole lately, mainly for Epic 
reasons.

Keeper is on a rotation and I'm going to add our guild to the rotation I 
think, but would like some information about it first.  None of the things 
I have read have mentioned what kind of battle to expect - just what kind 
of force it takes and how to get there.

Is he a caster?  Any nasty proc ( like the Scalekeeper )?  Anything 
interesting at all or is it just a melee battle?
