Yep I bound a troll there lastnight, he swam off the boat and went along to
the beach to the right of the outpost, I was able to bind him there safely,
he swam around the outside of the stonewall so make sure you do the same
(pretty sure you might agro a guard off the wall if you swim inside it,
can't be positive though since i haven't tried =P)
