Why does that surprise people? It is an EQ server and business as
usual no matter what it is labeled. Also, the people who keep
requesting that other people roleplay in shout please stop it or at
least look up the word "irony" in the dictionary. If you were really
roleplaying you'd ignore it or act like you have no idea what they are
saying.

Ahaha gratz you and the lizard regen ;) 

Oddly enough I saw the exact opposite in the barbarian area on my
shaman barb (now near level 9 and about to get sow) In fact, this is
the most crowded I have ever seen qeynos and the everfrost areas. 
Everyone was helping everyone quite a lot, healing each other, saving
each other, helping with extra kills. There was lots of cameraderie
etc. Really if you think about it that guy was sort of roleplaying an
iksar opportunist ;) The iksars are not exactly supposed to be loving
and in fact only the strongest survive.

There are usually about 119 in the qeynos newb area and about 145
people in everfrost now. I call it Qeyfaynos. Many of the barbs seem
fairly ignorant at the ease with which we can make patchwork and the
fact that everyone now has a loom in their city so hey, free sewing
kit ;)  Although rather held back from leveling due to the SHEER
NUMBER of other players, I had full patchwork nearly by level 4 then
ran through bb (actually quite easy due to the number of players ;) )
and started doing the clover shipment, 3 bard mails at once to qeynos
and lion meat delivery quests. I had forgotten that in addition to
getting a spell each time you return the clover, or a piece of
patchwork, you rarely get the coveted (well that low anyway) polar
bear cloak. I got one the second time so am now running around with
it. I also got the shaman innitiate thing at level 4 (great overlap of
quests to and from qeynos and WK for barbs) so its great to summon
magic hammer for me and any clr or pal. I just wish it was useable by
rangers and others so we could take out wisps now.

I was further slowed down from leveling because EVERY spawn place in
qey hills was taken up by rabid grizzlies and willowisps (over on the
harder end) which no one could kill yet to free up) finally at level 8
right when a ranger and I were grouped killing the then yellow rabid
grizzes (gad the xp is good from them and their pelt ;) ) a red to me
mage had cleared them all out first and he was also about the only one
who could already kill wisps (pet can hit magic) So knowing that guy
will accel fast, my barb told him that though he might not be able to
yet when he could I'd gladly pay him 5 gold for a bind in qeynos. He
said ok but could not yet. I'd guess he was level 10 or so then.

Aahha yeah he got his. My shaman really enjoys saving people actually,
I was running around with the ranger guy and rescuing overzealous
monks with ghetto innerfire buff/healing action.

Ahaha nice, yeah they said there MIGHT be a bit more GM action on this
server in the way of quests and such which I guess might mean they are
paying more attention also?

I wondered that, I thought that lake of ill omen would be a fantastic
place for an iksar to grow fast because its not the default newb area.
I started my twink iksar there on trib and loved it. I almost made an
iksar shaman but selected barb for the ability to be neutral and
group/guild with anyone I ever choose. Even with the 20 percent minus
(barbs have 10 though anyway.. so not a huge diff) you'd probably do
quite well with only 23 in the zone. You'd do much better than the 145
newbs in everfrost anyway.

Once I got to 7 and was in WK though it was quite nice.. there were
only 19 or so people there many that I did not see and some using that
second tower for a base like the ranger and I. Once you get a bit
ahead of the masses in the newb area I guess anywhere is ok.

AAHHAH it was like that in the barb area for a while. I ran by and
called it our barbarian tower of power.

A funny thing to me is that people are turning on plus pvp even on
this server. I thought people knew better by now. I saw 3 people with
it on and their characters are totally ruined of course. I explained
it to one guy and he just said "i kno I am pvp.." so I gave up. Of
course he will eventually learn that his char is shot.

I am having fun and am near to getting sow now, killed trumpy and got
his head at level 7 (now just have to turn in dwarfland when I feel
like going there.. maybe at 9 with sow) have bought out 65 or so bone
chips from vendors in halas at a time to do they pally quest in qeynos
(silly barbs.. thats some fantastic xp with 6 chips in the box at a
time) So even though I've seen a couple barbs yellow to me and a red
ot me mage I feel I'm ahead of the game in resources. I'll be able to
afford the 5 plat for sow when I get it in 3 orange bars. Then my next
plans are maybe getting my hammer from the dwarves then getting the
blue pally quest diseased shark bp from erudin around level 11 or 12,
then going to warrans maybe at 14 or near that (when I or some caster
there can bind) then getting some armor and later around 31 or 32
getting some blue chain armor from stonebrunt kobolds or whatever.
