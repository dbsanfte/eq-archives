Frankly, I don't think that even the wizards who *did* it gave a fuck
about any of the politics involved. It was mostly a sort of way to show
that it's no different than any other group of six level sixty people
with good gear and a lot of AA taking down some big mob.

On another board where we had this discussion, the only *semi* valid
response I heard was that it was "too easy" and "no risk" for a wizzy
manaburn team to take the dragon down. Dragon had no chance to fight
back, etc.  And they actually had the nerve to say that if a group of
six rangers did it (or five rangers and a cleric, let's say) that would
be "ok", because they were engaging the mob "the way you're supposed
to."

Ok, now they are doing it where the mob get's a full minute to fight
back and attack. Maybe evne a bit more.

Think this will shut up the whiners?

No way. It's still wizards casting big "KABOOM" spells, so it's wrong
for them to win a dragon encounter.
