Uh, no -- It means groups don't have to pick a cleric
over a shaman or druid for *any* mob.   All priests
heal equally well, just in different ways.   And the same
is true for other archtypes -- tank classes tank equally
well (although differently), and so on.

They eliminated the need for any particular *class*
in a group -- the need for certain *class types*
still exists.  AFAIK there's no "magical" class
that people won't fight without -- and that's as it
should be.   A druid LFG should be able to heal
for a group as well as a cleric;  likewise, a cleric
should be able to solo as well as a druid.  And so
on and so on.

That's an entirely different idea than balance within class
types -- and one I can't address, not having a 50 char
who has attempted every mob in the game...  But some
mobs are more resistant to certain types of damage or
have more HPs and less resists, etc -- same as in EQ.
