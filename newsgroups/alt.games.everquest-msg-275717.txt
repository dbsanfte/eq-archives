I've done plenty of dungeon soloing, and death was very rare.  I have 
just gotten pretty sick of soloing.

Necros are still in general much better soloers, they can get xp far 
faster than a soloing SK, as can wizards, druids, shaman, enchanters at 
the very least.  Necros also can do quite well in old world dungeons, 
with fd, single target mez (multiples if undead), and great pets.
