	Bite me.

	I've looked at the spell list for Bards.  Most of it, as with most
classes, is junk.  Resists are great, if you need them for the encounter.
Haste is good if you don't have an Enchanter; if you do, you only want the v3
songs.  Mana/regen is always nice.  Runspeed/invis/lev if you're moving.  The
rest, as far as buffs go, is pretty much attribute buffs, which are garbage.

	They stack.  With both, I can pretty much cast at will without running
OOM.
