>Then I might go off to try to obtain that elusive last pearlesent shard that I need to complete the set of four for my epic ONE.

The fragments aren't that hard to get if you can find a little help
with it.  I did my hunting out in the middle of the zone where there
are endless mobs to pull.  I try to avoid the Chromos but it's not the
end of the world if one finds ya.

I recently did the Cleric epic for a friend's cleric.  He had 1 shard,
nothing else.

I got the othe 3 shards in a litle over 1 hour using a high level mage,
SK, and Shaman.

Two days ago, I reactivated my 2nd account and decided to do my
cleric's epic again ( yes, again, first one is gone ).  I went to Lake
Rathe.  Begurgle's PH wasn't up.  I killed all the other goblins and in
about 20 minutes Begurgle spawns.  I kinda felt bad for whomever killed
that last PH and left.

So, I run to Sol A to camp for the night at the Gimblox camp.  I kill 1
PH and start reading the Rogue epic for my low-level rogue.  I finish
reading the epic and wait for the next spawn before camping.... Gimblox
spawns.  Kill; Gate; Camp.

Next day, I take the same 3-some to Skyfire ( and camp my cleric there
) and get 4 fragments in about 1.5 hours.

I'm going to try to 4-box Overking tonight.  I really really suck at
2-boxing, so 4-boxing is going to be horribly ugly but at least it will
be interesting!
