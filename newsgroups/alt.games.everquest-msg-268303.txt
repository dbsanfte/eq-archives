I found it.  Had to sift through a few thousand lines of log getting
rid of the spam (starting by searching for lines that said "you"),
and finally noticed a place in the middle of the boss fight where I
was "blessed by the boon of the fateseer".  I looked that up on Alla
and found it's a clicky effect from the Shaman epic 2.0; a 1-minute
buff that includes a chance for crits.  So someone must've tossed
that into the mix during the battle.

Hm, speaking of group buffs, a related question: what does it mean
when a spell is described as target "group v1" or "group v2"?  Does
that have to do with whether it's MGB-able or something?  Having only
recently gotten a character into the high 40s I'm trying to learn more
about how the high-level buffs work.
