i haven't been on an eq1 server in a year, but here's my answers
(because i recently resubscribed and will be on this week, haha!):

charm viable? absolutely, but there have been some changes

as much as i loved complaining (because it was really just reminiscing
of when we were so clearly on top), enchanter charm has moved in line
with what's generally fair; don't expect to be godlike and don't
expect it to be easy ... it's still work and it's still powerful but
there are better soloers out there

the coercer is eq2's enchanter, in terms of charm (the illusionist is
the other side of the enchanter .... kind of a long explanation, but
coercer is what you want if you liked charming)

it's a great ability and it plays out well, but eq2 is really very
simplistic

sometimes you'll enjoy that, other times you'll miss the reward that
comes from mastering a class and knowing how to bend to fit with other
classes and adapting to new situations, etc
