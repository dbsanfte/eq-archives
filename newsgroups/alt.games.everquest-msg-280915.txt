Well, yes - common sense I would have thought.  I started with a
couple of RL friends a few years back, and we just automatically made
the same race/same city characters, just to hang out and learn the
ropes.  It seemed the most elementary thing to do.

Mainly because the quests are so incredibly crap, by and large.
Mostly, you grind away trying to get several items that hardly ever
drop, off a mob (or mobs) that spawn once in a blue moon - and you get
a crappy item with 5ac and +2 to Wis and Dex or something.  I have
looked many quests over at Allakhazam's before wasting time on quests
for junk, and honestly, you can buy better for lunch money in the
Bazaar.  Believe me, I'm no powerleveller, either.  I enjoy the game,
but sitting on my ass waiting days for a pop is NOT enjoyable.

This is what I meant when I mentioned "fundamentals" in a recent post.
I don't want a stream of expansions featuring stupendous "this and
that" when you get to 60+...  Spruce up the old zones by having an EQ
World War or something and add new content and mobs/loot THERE, for
god's sake.  Make *getting* to 60 fun again.  The old zones have been
moribund for years
