    It is true that this summit message does not mean that the concerns of
the general community will never be addressed.  But it is very
disheartening that the first words that  they write after the summit
address the concerns of the high end raider types more than the average
player.  Given that we all know the type of person that made the invite
list, it reinforces the notion that perhaps the upcoming improvements are
not being made with many, indeed, most of us in mind.

   Even taking the argument that they just listed a bunch of quick fixes
they could hammer out in a flash before they got to the real meat and
potatoes stuff... why couldn't some of the quick fixes have been geared for
the more casual player?

   Because the didn't ask us, is why.  And given that, it is easy to make
the conclusion that they don't care about us at all.
