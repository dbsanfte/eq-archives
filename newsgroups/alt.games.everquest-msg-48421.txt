First off, never call me sunshine. I will fucking own you.

>a seriously disturbed head and is illegal to boot.  

Sure, it's illegal. Normal, law abiding people break some mundane law every
fucking day. It's not like they were putting hydrochloric acid in the soda. 
Granted, it's mean, seeing as visine gives you gas and the shits, but you try
being a waitress for one day, and see you much you like drunken bum trying to
feel up on your tits or something similiar.
And you'd be surprised how many angry teenage cooks "fuck with the food".
Especially in McDonalds.  (no, I do not, nor have I ever worked at a McDonalds.
I'm currently training to be a professional body piercer.)


>How about you two nasty fucks get a room k?

How 'bout I plonk you? And better yet, you can use YOUR killfile appropriately,
and we'll never have to deal with eachother again, k? That is, assuming you
know what a killfile is.
