dude i agree with you on the gameplay thing, im a gameplay freak. Although i
never realy plyed snake much, i found it dull. Especially since i'd played
the same thing on Windows Entertainment Pack 3, years ago. But its a decent
game, perhaps better if phones had a controler. :P um, anyway, what should i
say... GAMECUBE rewls! suck bloody Defxbox and its gforce 3, At least
Nintendo is still making games like they used to (AND better)
