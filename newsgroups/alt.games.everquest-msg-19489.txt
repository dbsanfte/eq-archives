What gets me most about this, is that they don't want to let you take your
items and cash with you to another server.

It's about time they gave up insisting that things like that will "ruin the
server economy". Because there isn't one, in most cases, on any of the
normal non-PvP servers. They're already completely flooded with plat and
items, and the only real outflow of those items is through character
deletion or corpse loss.

Put a limit on the amount of money they can take along. Put a limit on the
amount of equipment they can take along. But don't make them go naked and
claim it's bad for the economy otherwise, because it's really just not true.
