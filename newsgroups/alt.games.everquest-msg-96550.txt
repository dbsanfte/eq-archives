I disagree.  My main is a necromancer roleplayer, he's evil and he
deliberately trains other players all the time.  My favorite is to go
somewhere where there are many undead, and with a helpful SoW (best when
bestowed by an innocently helpful 3rd party) provoke several undead into
attacking him.  Then he spurts toward the nearest "safe" spot, casts
invisibility just before he gets there, and quietly sits down in the back of
the crowd.  Undead, you may recall, hit the closest living PC.  Much fun for
everyone!

It's an interesting experience in social dynamics too.  The players have
never figured out what was going on, they just suddenly get hit by swarms of
undead.  Despite being wounded and surprised, they tend to rally very well
and causalties are actually surprisingly rare.

I have several other tricks to amuse my evilness, but I'll withhold the
others for now.  I prefer to torment dwarves and the "especially good"
classes.  Before all the roleplaying paladin-scum start whining about the
unfairness of the universe and how a GM would shudder at what amuses me let
me remind that what other players aren't aware of can't be reported.
