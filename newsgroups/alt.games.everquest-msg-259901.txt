I think what's different is that in EQ there's plenty of ambiguity about who 
owns the mob, and the result over many years has been an ettiquete that's 
evolved to determine the fair result. In my experience, most players abide 
by these protocols and you have to have a certain level of maturity to be 
able to handle that kind of discipline. It's pretty amazing that it actually 
works out most of the time and I attribute this to a more mature and 
seasoned player population with very strong peer pressure enforcement. Hell, 
you even see these characteristics in the alt.games.everquest newsgroup.

When a game lays down a black & white rule and decides for you the rules of 
engagement, there's no longer any need to be reasonable or accomodating and 
you start to see the kind of behaviors I witnessed where people would *try* 
and "steal" camped spawns from each other and then gloat if they succeeded 
or swear and start the namecalling if they failed. I'd be willing to bet 
that some of these guys had already fulfilled their quest quotas and were 
hanging around camping additional spawns just out of *spite*.
