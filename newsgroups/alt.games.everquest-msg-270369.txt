Most games post-EQ have not really developed much of a usenet presence.
There's a brief spurt for a few months when the game is new, and then most
activity seems to be on web-based forums.

Here's how many posts Google has in alt.games.anarchy-online each month
for the first two years, starting at March 2001:

    6
    44
    92
    3238
    9164
    3704
    1336
    899
    389
    89
    137
    96
    114
    93
    44
    123
    129
    62
    38
    13
    21
    27
    48
    75
         
The DAoC group shows a similar pattern, and the SWG shows signs that it will
do the same thing.  For whatever reason, it seems that most games since EQ
have had most of their discussion activity in web-based forums, rather than
on usenet.
