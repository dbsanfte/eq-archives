Same level and aprx stats here.  Rathe is also heavily camped on my server,
but I've found that there are certain times of day that it's not as busy.
Because plat adds up so fast here it's really not a problem to log on early
in the morning 5-6 AM and grab some quick cash from time to time.

Another suggestion I've heard, but not yet tried myself are the Nobles in
HighKeep.  The problem here is from what I've heard this is also a very busy
spot but loot is good and you can still get exp here.

I've also recently heard that Neriak Commons is a good place for cash.
Check out Shamans Crucible hunting ground boards for more details.

Another option is Stonebrunt.  There are some quests there that require
killing of Ancient beasts of various types. The items are all sellable and
are decent items and not hard to do at your level.  While you are waiting on
these to spawn killing the Pandas can net some gems similiar to the value of
those you get on the Cyclops Island in OOT.

Then there is the Cyclops Island in OOT.  Cyclops's drop a variety of gems
that sell from 15-90 pp ea.  I have a friend who financed a horse this way.

I've never camped the Geonids myself because they are heavily camped on my
server but I've heard the loot is great.
