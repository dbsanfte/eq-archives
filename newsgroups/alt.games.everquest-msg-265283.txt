Welcome,

Nope islands are not mixed either, they don't want anyone using some sort of
blackmarket unground other than their own for trading goods I guess, at
least until you've made your mark cause eventually the two sides can meet
but it will take quite a few levels before your safe enough unless of course
you become a traitor to your side.

As for favorite character and classes, I can only speak for myself, Rangers
are as good or better and much more popular from what I see, Casters
especially Conj. are not simply because of the pet issues but eventually
that will change when people start seeing some of the amazing pets for that
class, and warriors can be found everywhere as they tank us alot for healing
when they need it most.

Yes it will be fun, yes it will be different, yes you will most all be in
awe.
