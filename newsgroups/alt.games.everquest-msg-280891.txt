i never pulled quavonis, i always stood by the wall, polishing my armor or
ae-buffing something stupid, depending on the toon

i forgot you can't pull the monk out of the lava...again, i had to wait on
the side for that one too...stupid non-fireproof robes =(

and no, i have never been to sol c ... always meant to do it, never got
around to it

as you can see, the one time i DID jump in the lava ruined my whole
perception of the greater experience...still haven't 'found' pain and
suffering, either

and incidentally ... the lava you must swim through in...what's that zone,
with the trolls and the pig from Lion King, where innoruuk can spawn and the
loot is really bad? you know, the one you enter just off the side of the
zone where everyone trains from the beach, in that expansion that no one
wanted that should have just been a patch?

ok, going the wrong direction here, but you see what i mean =)
