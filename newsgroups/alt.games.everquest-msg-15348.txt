You know I can cheat a pinball game by using a magnet on the ball.
Should I do it, just because I can? Or should the pinball manufacturer
change the material of the ball? Then again I could just take the machine
apart and fiddle with the mechanism. Then should the manufacturer make
the thing out if titanium and weld it together to prevent tampering?

Get a grip.

Verant can fix all the bugs they want, until the sun goes nova.
But the cheating players will ALWAYS find and use some game flaw
or mechanic to get an advantage. So all Verant can do is set some
rules down and punish the transgressors when they find them.

Just like Police in real life can't stop crime but they can keep it down
to a reasonable level. I like to say they keep the honest people honest.
