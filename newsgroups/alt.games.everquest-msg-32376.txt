Speaking for myself, I only bother to report names that are fairly
blatant violations, such as the one mentioned in that thread. Despite
what some here no doubt think, I don't make a practice of checking the
/who list in every zone for petitionable names. If someone with a dumb
name brings it to my attention, by shouting or being annoying in some
way, then I have no qualms about reporting them.

As for your idea of reporting all names, obviously that's not
possible. For one thing, you can only have one petition in the queue
at a time, which right away slows things down considerably.

Further, while I find them annoying and sad, I just don't think the
countless variations on Muad'dib and Gandalf are worth the effort.

As would we all. Unfortunately, some players insist on ignoring the
naming rules, which in turn ends up occupying that valuable GM time.

The problem isn't with opposing viewpoints. The problem is in *how*
those viewpoints are presented. All too often, the 'new poster' who
you see getting flamed opens up with some sort of insulting comments.

As a recent example, take Menotti (not picking on you Menotti, just
using your posts as an illustration). He recently started a thread
about "People who play on blue servers...", and was resoundingly
ripped for it. It wasn't his observations that got him attacked, it
was how he presented them. Menotti is rare, though, in that he got the
point, and tried again. He started a new thread on the same subject,
but presented it as a discussion starter instead of an insult, and was
much better received for it.

> or are accused of being the same person.

That kind of accusation comes from the number of times we've seen that
exact behavior here in the past. It really does happen, sadly.

None taken, because of the way you presented your points.

If every new poster actually showed some intelligence and
consideration, as you have here, well, this would be a much quieter
newsgroup, at the very least.
