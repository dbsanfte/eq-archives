I've been led to realize by the benevolent force that has been guiding me
that I would make a decent Roger Corman replacement. I am good at seeing
talent, good at knowing where it should fit in in the grand scheme of things
and good at making it productive, good at knowing what is art and what is
not. I think I have a fairly decent grasp of film and I always seem to have
money. I think I would make a good executive producer, and perhaps I should
try making a film from that standpoint instead of as an editor or writer or
director. It seems like an executive producer does these things.

Initiate projects based upon an idea someone has and find the funding for
them or provide it yourself.

Posess a general understanding of film concepts but don't need to know all
the latest technologies, although how much they cost to implement is
important.

Organize the production at the highest level, choosing the key players like
the producer, director, cinematographer, writer and meeting with them on a
regular basis to find out what they are doing and giving them advice or
encouragement or negative reinforcement if they need any.

Based upon those rules, here is what I would like to see

Producer: Wheeler
Director/Star: Diesel
Cinematographer: Ittenbach
Writer: Ashton

I can get 10K of my own money if I can get it out of my mother, and maybe if
I tell her that I want to make a movie for a profit and can prove I am
serious maybe she will give it to me. I expect half of all profits and the
other half will be split among everyone else as I am the one putting up the
cash.

Id like to make a movie about the last interesting idea he was talking about
which was a movie(he actually wanted to do this in real life)about a guy who
is sick of working at his dead end factory job making nothing and wants to
live the good life by turning to a life of crime and he rents a wherehouse
in the middle of San Jose for 6 months and fills it with weed and grows it,
then sells it for a fortune and moves to a foreign country and has 5 wives
and is the ruler of the country and lives happily ever after.

It seems like the first step is to create a script. So I will do this with
my friend, sit down and write a script of at least a very detailed concept
with the things that happen on the way to the end, then I guess send it to
Wheeler who seems to know a lot about filmmaking and the people who take
part in it.

I'd like to try to make a film every year if we could and be successful
enough so all people involved could take 3 months or so off every year. The
angelic voice that is guiding me has taught me a few tricks to help me in my
trade which include sending expensive gifts to people who you want to help
you and always carrying a pack of cigarettes and lighter just in case you
come in contact with someone who smokes so you can put them at ease. (This
voice must be an angel or something)

So we are going to make 30 films one each year. Films I would like to see
would be all the films that the major 4 would like to see. I only really
know Ashton and Wheeler so these are some of their ideas I remember

Thomas Covenant Trilogy by Stephen R. Donaldson(maybe the last 3 books but
that would be pushing it) I think the 1st 3 would be adequate.
Some sort of an apocalyptic good evil trilogy, maybe
A movie about destroying the Silicon Valley called "The Big One"
Perhaps a movie about an army of giant robotic soldiers controlled by expert
video game players?

Right now I just want to make a movie about a guy who doesn't like his life
and turns to a life of crime and suceeds and gets everything he wants as a
result, it doesn't need to be a great film, just a decent entertaining movie
that people will pay to see.

I will start by getting a script or the foundation for a script with all the
key elements completed, then find Mike Wheeler's address which is located in
a book lost somewhere in my room, then send him the idea along with a decent
bottle of liquor that I think he would enjoy, a copy of the movie that he
made as a tribute to his greatness, and a nice letter written on good paper
attached to the idea and ask him if he wanted to make this movie and if he
does then he can and then I guess he will figure out how much it will cost
to make and hopefully figure out how to pay for it with my 10K as seed money
to start with, and then I guess we will just see what happens from there. If
it doesn't work out then I will be completely penniless and without a job,
but I don't care because my life is a complete fucking piece of shit right
now and I have no where to go but up and God himself has told me that I
cannot fail, I need only try with the barest amount of effort and I can
succeed.

I'd like the film completed by Oct.14, I'll give myself a month to have the
concept finished and locate Wheeler's address(which is the hardest part for
me)and a suitable bottle of liquor, out of the 4 I was led to purchase last
night, I think he should get the most evil looking one I could find in the
whole store, (shit i gotta go out to my car and see what it is called and
what it looks like be right back)
