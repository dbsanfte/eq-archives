Level 39 Paladin, and the only character I have, well apart from a couple of
real low level ones.
Suppose I should think more about developing others?
But hey! Im quite fond of  my pally, and I guess Im learning all the time.

Been playing for around 6 months, and I appear to have hit a stop!
I have spent some time on tradeskills, 5 skills are 140 plus, and done a
huge amount of farming pelts and silks in North karana but the XP has really
dried up....I seem to have spent the last 6/8 weeks going from 37 to 39, and
really think I should start to move on?

I have fairly good stuff, my HP is 1450 unbuffed, and my Runed Frost Blade
hits OK, if a little heavy. I do have 1hs and Sarnak sheild too.  Plus my
Ghoulbane. I have all my spells.

Being in UK and playing on Saryn server means the times I seem to spend
online are usually quiet. UK time 14.00hrs.

Therefore I tend to mostly play solo, apart from some late night sessions
grouping in High Keep Basement, and my early days visiting various Orc and
Derv camps in the Commons. I still owe that Dorn B' Dynn chap in the desert
too! Though Gix has been paid back many times.

Anyway, I suppose Im asking where next?

I have looked at Atlas and alakhazm and think maybe I should venture to any
of these?

1 Rathe Mountains
2 The Overthere
3 The Burning Woods
4 The Dreadlands

Any comments or suggestions would be gratefully received.

Thankyou
