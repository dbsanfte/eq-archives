But the way you put it meant to imply that he was. Hence the
'overpowering' aspects of it. It shouldn't be overpowering to hold
agro over any particular class that isn't trying to take it.

Agreed here.

I guess the key word you used here was special. It was assumed you
were meleeing, the catch here was your admission the pally wasn't
trying to agro.

/shrug. I don't care your views on my attitude, I'm not here to make
friends or stroke your ego. That having been said, my views on the
instanced zones are true. If you think otherwise give the new zones a
try and peel your characters off the sidewalls of Tipt from mobs that
quad-1200 and can smoke 10K+/1900 AC+ tanks if taken head on. You've
either got to reevaluate what you and your group are doing as a
Warrior or play chauffer to a chanter pet. And chanter pets can have
their own sets of problems that cause much pain.

Or.. you can LDoN ad infinatum.... xp in the planes, even elemental,
all you'd like. They are nice safe places and relatively easy to get
to and set a group up for in comparison, and you can just tank all day
long with no problems whatsoever. CR's are just waiting for your body
to pop and rezz. So, if I make the comparison between the minors and
the majors... these examples are simply a measure of why.
