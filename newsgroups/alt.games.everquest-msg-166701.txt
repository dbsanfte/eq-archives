I never mentioned a time frame for military power, only economic.  And
post-civil war is too broad for the economic power that the US gained.
Almost every other country was devasted by Germany in WWI, leaving the
US almost unscathed economically.  And again during WWII it was even
worse for them and better for us.  We were the only ones to come out
standing, with the USSR down on one knee and all others flat.  This
was due primarily to our location, Hitler (and the Kaiser before him)
couldn't easily get to us and had to concentrate their resources on
europe, and asia eventually.

That was my point.  Location, location, location.  We were isolated
physically and economically, though I didn't really clarify that.
