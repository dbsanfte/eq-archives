Both systems (no drop & attunable) undermine the multiplayer game at 
hand.  I think we do want players to interact; but we still want some 
control over where the items go.)

No drop eliminates interaction entirely. And attunable drives mudflation 
faster than ever before, because attunable items will be much cheaper 
than regular items because they are much more limited.

It sounds like the helmet is essnentially beneath your level at this 
point; given that you claim you completed the quest yourself in 2001.

In my proposal for a variable decay rate & repeairable items system; I 
would be confident that anything that you personally earned and put 
minimal maintenance into it would continue to serve you indefinately.

The decay rate and repair costs would be designed to be a burdon on 
heavy twinks, with level far beyond what they could loot themselves.
