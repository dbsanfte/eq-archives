My hafling druid has done that, but I like to make a game of it. Distribute one
or two nice lowbie rings to mobs in the Qeynos newbie area -- cutthroat dervish
rings or silver resist jewelry (I've been training an enchanter.) Then back to
the gate and start ooc-ing: "I've dropped my ring and some critter ran off with
it! Could anyone help me find it? I'll pay a reward!" Of course, nothing anyone
brings me will be "grandma's sapphire ring", so they get to keep what they find.
