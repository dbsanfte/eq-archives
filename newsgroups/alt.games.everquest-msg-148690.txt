While we're on the subject of sound <hijack>...

Ever since the patch where they "fixed" the clink of coins in the bank, I
now have abnormally LOUD effects for opening containers, changing money and
rain.  If I turn the sound effects down, then alll the other effects are too
low.  Anyone else notice this?

I have an SBLive X-gamer card.
