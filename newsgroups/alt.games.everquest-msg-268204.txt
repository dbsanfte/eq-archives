Quest XP is better than group XP.  Killing in a raid
gives everyone the same quest messages as if they
were in a group.  A raid can kill mobs they couldn't
in single-groups.  Assuming XP is point-based as
in EQ, people will level faster in raids doing
high-orange quests faster than they would doing
level-appropriate content.  The only real limiting
factor is some quests won't be provided based on
level.
