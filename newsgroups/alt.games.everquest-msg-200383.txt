Level 60 or higher enchanter actually.  The actual effect of KEI is, boost 
mana regen by 14 points per tick (every 6 seconds), add 25 to Wisdom, add 
25 to Int, and add 250 to the mana pool.  KEI lasts for a minimum of 2.5 
hours which is what makes it so amazingly popular.  At level 63 Enchanters 
get an upgrade called Tranquility, which is 16 mana/tick, 26 Int/Wis, 260 
mana, but only lasts 1 hour 20 minutes minimum.  At level 65 Enchanters get 
the final upgrade, Voice of Quellious, which is 18 mana/tick, 28 Int/Wis, 
and 275 mana.  Like Tranquility, it lasts for a minimum of 1 hour 20 
minutes.  Due to the duration, KEI remains by far the most popular for 
paying an enchanter to cast on you.

Just to clarify on "nerf", it applies to anything that is reduced in 
utility, a spell, a skill, an item, etc.
