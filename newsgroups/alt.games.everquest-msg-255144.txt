Actually, its quite likely not a -virus-. Virii are defined by their 
behaviour of self replicating and spreading, typically relying on an 
indirect action (e.g. opening an email attachement) but occasionally 
being able to spread entirely without help.

If I write a peice of software that formats your HD when you open it, 
and you get my software by downloading it youself from my website 
because I lied and told you it was an animated valentines day card. Then 
its not a virus and is unlikely to be picked up by NAV or anyother av 
application.

Just as spyware and other malware may be highly undesirable on your PC, 
its not picked up by antivirus software because 1) its not infectious 
and isn't their mandate, and 2) The folks at AV developers are unlikely 
to ever obtain the signature for the software in the first place because 
it is -not- infectious; ie because unless I tell them to go to my 
website and download my valentines day card they'll never even encounter 
my little piece of malware.
