I'm almost through the fansub Inu Yasha series. I think they're still
making the series in Japan, not sure. It's kinda hard to get the
episodes DLed, there are something in the order of 130 of them. I've
been grabbing 10 at a time. Just gotta search one episode at a time
and use 3 different variants of the title. ( ie "Inu Yasha 20"
"Inuyasha 20" and "Inu-Yasha 20" ) Usually you'll get multiple
versions, and sometimes you have to try to DL them all to get one that
actually downloads. (One thing that bugs the hell out of me about
Kazaa... The search turns up results, but it tells me "needs more
sources" when I try to DL. If there weren't enough sources, why the
hell does it give me a hit on the search?! :( )
