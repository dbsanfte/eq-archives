Of all arguments ever offered, this is always the most specious.  You can't
justify one evil by pointing to another.  What's the point of it?  Where do
you go with that? Such whining rhetoric has no force of validity in logic
and it makes no progress toward a solution of anything.

When you have read both texts, only then will you see the huge difference in
degree, as to which of these contains the greatest frequency of the said
"deadly verses."  Until then, until you have read them, all you can do is
just as you do, to parrot the mawkish sentiments that we hear every time
some ill-read blatherer on tv opens his/her mouth to continue the blithering
of snot-nosed empty platitudes.
