Me too.  I sort of wish they had indicated that a little more prominently.
I logged in, got aggroed, and couldn't figure out why I couldn't attack.  I
ended up beating the mob to death with secondary attacks as I scanned my
hotkey menu to see if they had changed it or if I was suffering from a
pretty severe bug.

I mean seriously, after reading a couple paragraphs of most patch messages,
my eyes glaze over and I just say the hell with it.  It was really easy to
miss that pretty fundamental change.
