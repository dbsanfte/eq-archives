I'd definitely argue that pre-KEI, the balance was shifted to the side
of the melees. My untwinked Iksar monk always solo'd faster than my
shaman, at any point up to 50th lvl. He just had to be a lot more
selective as to targets. Don't forget that pre-Luclin, Fungis where
cheap (bought mine for 25k, only item I own that went UP in value<g>),
0.5 ratio weapons where relatively easy to get....

Same way a caster affords KEI? Plus you really don't need it, my monk
solo'd fine without it, and I always went after mobs I could take at
half hitpoints, if I had to wait for Mend to pop between kills, I
wouldn't bother. I did have the advantage of FD of course which meant
I could live closer to the edge. Admittedly, my warrior is a pretty
serious twink but he'd solo to 50 if it wasn't so damn boring a lot
quicker than any other class I can think of.

Upper and lower Guk at the zone woulda gotten you to 40, Tundra yeti
in DL to 45, BW or LoIO Aqua-goblins to 51 (not sure at what lvl they
can be single pulled though). I'm leaving out all the cool solo camps
that a monk can (could, pre-nerf?) do. I know of one warrior that is
staying 60 and working on AA just so his favorite solo spot doesn't
turn light blue. . 

If you're argueing that the balance has now turned back to casters, I
wouldn't argue but it sure isn't as bad as people are making it out to
be. 

As for my view on KEI, my shaman ignores it. I won't even zone once to
hook up with a free KEI. My wizard twink hasn't been without either
KEI or PotG (usually both) since he was born, and I still have
downtime at 17th lvl!
