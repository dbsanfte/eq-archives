To my knowledge, there is no trick to getting either to spawn.  Everyone who
swore they know the 'secret' was unable or unwilling to share or verify it,
which to my mind makes it sheer boasting.

The South Ro Ancient Cyclops is on a spawn table with some other mobs (like
every other mob in EQ).  All of the mobs on that spawn table wander, and
there are four confirmed starting points for that table.  Thus, the simplest
solution (and the one most likely to bear fruit) is to wipe the desert part
of the zone and keep it wiped.  Otherwise you can't be sure you're killing
the mobs on that spawn table.

Quillmane is also on a spawn table with other mobs, and those other mobs are
also not confirmed.  Quill at least has a confirmable path once she's up.
I've gotten two feathered cloaks for friends (and innumerable feathered
leggings) by using my bard running a square bordered by the Shadowed Men
camp, east to the zone wall, south to the zone wall, west to the zone wall,
north to the Shadowed Men camp - with tracking running nonstop.  (No, I
didn't run all the way to the zonewall, I ran to within tracking range.)
Continue until you're tired to death of it, then keep going more.  When she
hits tracking, engage immediately before the other fifty people in zone KS
you.
