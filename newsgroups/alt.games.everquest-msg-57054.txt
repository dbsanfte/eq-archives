Yep, it looks like it. Unfortunately they were the *only* ISP offering
unmetered net access, with no cut off period, for a fixed monthly fee
here in the UK. We don't have the luxury of free local loop calls here
and broadband is still limited to only the very biggest cities. I
can't get broadband for any amount of money and I live in a regional
capital city. Pathetic considering the UK is one of the worlds largest
economies. Looks like my EQ days are done, or at least will be
extremely irksome. Who will want to group with a player who disappears
every 45 minutes ?. Nobody!.
