Yeah. I created the Krew to deal with the "noise" problem on the UO newsgroup.
I had hoped this place would be better. Oh well. 

The beauty of actively killfiling people is it makes Usenet a much more
productive resource.

Kind of like the good cable remotes that let you lock out the Golf Channel and
ESPN.

================================================

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
