   I can understand where you are coming from.  My EQ account is still
active, but I haven't logged on for to actually play for almost 4 weeks. 
And I'm not missing it.  I was so into the game for so long that I am
hesitant to take the next logical step and actually cancel, but there is a
good chance that I will.  Maybe.  It just seems too weird to write that.

    Now me, I have no plans to leave a.g.e. Whatever else EQ might be or
become, it is the largest, best know and groundbreaking MMORPG to date. 
Even if it gets taken over by some new game down the line, it will still be
in my mind the First Big One that introduced so many to the genre.  Even if
I permanently move on to some other game, I will be interested in what
happens in EQ if for nothing more than academic reasons.
    Anyways, that's what I'm telling myself now.  Plus, I don't really feel
like giving up the FAQ either.  It isn't that hard to maintain and keep on
the web, and since it is the age.faq and I am still active in age, I feel
that I still have a valid context in which to remain the keeper of it.

   Thanks for the special treatment, sorry to see ya go.  But do keep
checking to see is alt.coh has been picked up.  I just found out this
morning that Charter ISP now carries it, and I never did ask them too. 
That suggests to me that slowly, but surely, it is getting picked up.  So I
hope to see you there!
