OH NO WHICH POST AM I REPLYING TO?  THE ONE ABOVE ME OR THE ONE ABOVE
THAT?

I must be so elite to have a MOUSE WHEEL where I can roll it down and
instantly be at the bottom of a post.  Then I push my finger to hit
the "clicky" button and suddenly I am able to type at the bottom of
any post!

Just thought I'd say that to my newsgroup and all our wonderful
friends in the 9 other newsgroups this is crossposted to.  Because
supposedly crossposting is so bad, but really it is fun to interact
with other newsgroups! ^________^!!!!!!!!!!

I would like to point out that no one from AGFF has whined about
crossposting yet.
