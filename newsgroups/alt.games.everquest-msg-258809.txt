That was a factor I didn't consider... but halflings aren't all -that- 
far, and think of Humans, who have to first make it out a tunnel that is 
one of the few places in the game where you are penalized for being 
night bline, then cross the "high level" zone of QH in order to get to 
Qeynos for a POK book.

Woodies would be OK I guess, as would Half Elves if you pick Tunare... 
and even if you picked Karana you'd at least be able to see in the 
Surefall tunnel!

But the point wasn't to kill high level stuff, it was to kill LOTS of 
stuff, so I wanted to kill the easiest things I could find, as fast as I 
could.  Instead of Temp, which could result in down time, SLN, which 
reduces or prevents down time while killing easy mobs, seemed the way to go.

Well, remember he also has an Ikky chestplate, so thats 5 more hp per 
tic... the effect of lots of HP regen is cumulative, as my berserker 
could tell you (41 hp/tic standing regen)

He's a twink, his AC is outlandishly high for his level, although 32 
more wouldn't hurt of course.

Question is, how many hp does 32 extra hp save per blow?

Yes, if winning a tough fight and then sitting and getting all those 
lost HP back is your goal, Temp is unquestionably superior.  I'm just 
suggesting that if killing as many mobs per hour as possible is your 
goal, that SLN might be more help.

Its not about the HP totals (which are only important in tough fights), 
its about the effectiveness of 2 hp more per tic versus the 
effectiveness of 32 more AC

So a hotkey:

/track
/forgage
/autoinv

placed in hotkey slot 10, and tying the left turn arrow to slot 10, 
would work?

Maybe some delays?
