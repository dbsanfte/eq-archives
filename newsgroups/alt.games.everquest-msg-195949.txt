Shaman slow and tank mez mobs quite a lot with that torpor trick, and its
amusing when they and their pet end up killing their victim before the main

as a Cheal (or Supernal Remedy for that matter) barring focus items or AA
expenditures.

Not that I don't toss em off whenever I feel like it, mind you.
