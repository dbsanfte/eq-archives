This isn't really a gripe, *most* of these people are only trying to help,
I'm sure

Just 2 examples because they are on the same mob

Monday,
I see a griffon in WC while talking to friend and we both agree that my
chances of solo'ing said mob are low but I figure if I take it to zone line
and fight there I can always bug out. I do so, starts badly but then the
Griffon stops landing and my Yaks start proc'ing,Griff turns I give chase
after the wounded animal but I'm not in great shape. Then a spell goes off,
the griphon is rooted, it can no longer run so it turns to face me again, it
finally dies when the caster nukes it, but I am down to under 100 health
(thats pretty much 2 hits from a griffon)
I approach the caster and say "Rooting that nearly got me killed" I am not
that happy, the reply "Haha.."

Yesterday,
Pulling Griffon to WK zone in NK (away from path) I'm sow'd from a potion
and have to keep stopping and waiting, all of a sudden it's miles
away...hmmm I must have outrun it's aggro radius, np I'll just go back, I
get closer and closer until I finally I'm in it's (rediculously large)
attack range and on the wrong of a quad attack I back away and then notice
the druid standing not so far away, I receive a tell "I've rooted it for
you" Argh! I tell her I didn't want it rooted as I was pulling it to the
zone to fight, rest of the conversation goes along the lines of I was only
trying to help...I prolly would have just laughed it off if it wasn't for
last time I tell the druid she is welcome to it I'll get another, and rest,
I don't respond to the offer of that one, in case I say something out of
turn that, in this situation isn't called for.

I know the last one was actually trying to help and may not have seen me
stopping constantly and waiting for the Grif to catch up but the first guy,
I dunno what he was thinking, by the reply I doubt he was trying to help me
much.

I don't play any casters so I don't know the situation and I suppose for
every one time you get it wrong there 10 other occasions you get it right
and save someones hide, I just always seem to be 10%  :ï¿½)

When you see a bard, running in a circle, being chased by a squeeling
beetle, please don't nuke the beetle, the bard's not in any danger, or he'd
be on his toes and out the zone.
