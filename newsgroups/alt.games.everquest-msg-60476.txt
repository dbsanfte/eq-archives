I am also using @Home cable modem, and I never had a problem playing EQ with
@Home.  I did occasionaly get packetloss and high pings, but it was
rare...and even then only during peek playing times.

I'm not sure what to tell you.  But the fact you're using a USB ethernet
device sure is suspicious to me.

You really should buy a normal PCI ethernet card.  I use nothing but Linksys
cards in my machines, but that's just personal preference.  Windows is good
about detecting and configuring ethernet devices.  And ethernet cards are
cheap.  If you want to play EQ right now, you could pick up a network card
at Best Buy for around $20.  (You can get them cheaper if you bought them
online, but then you'd have to pay for shipping and wait 4 - 6 weeks for it
to arrive.)

Do you have any other USB devices that are pluged into your USB ports?  Like
USB sound speakers, etc?

And don't listen to anyone who says anything about "firewalls" or "open
ports."  The very fact you are able to get to the character select screen
and enter the world at all tells me there's no problem with firewalls or
blocked ports.

Install a PCI ethernet card.  And tell me if that clears it up.  And
completely unplug your USB ethernet device.
