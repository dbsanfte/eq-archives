Sure we are, you have to get your sniffer properly placed, and Thats
simply not going to happen.

Yes, out of the 200 million Internet users, there are 1 M hackers and
Skript kiddies and 300 K  EQ users.  of those 1 M hackers and Kiddies
there are  10 K who play EQ.  of those 10 K,  1 Percent have the Skills
to gain passwords, that 100 persons.  I'm not going to do it, so that
leaves 99 people.  assuming at least 50% conform to the casual sort of
ethics that are more common among those who can.  we have 50 persons who
might have motive and ability to steal passwords.  They are going to be
attacking soft targets(Universities or cable connections).

Yes, but competition to sit at that point is fierce, and there is an
electric fence with an armed guard walking by every hour.

ITS A HARD TARGET.  Don't compare the techniques used to attack soft
targets to the ones used to hit hard targets.  Someone is wearing body
armor, you don't use a pistol,  Someone is a martial arts expert, you
don't attack them with a knife.  Someone is wearing Plate mail, a steak
knife won't be too effective.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
