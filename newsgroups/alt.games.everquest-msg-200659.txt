You project a fascinating persona here in this group.  Sadly, you
are showing yourself as unworthy of the respect I felt towards you
some time ago.  And yet, clearly deserving of an entirely different
sort of admiration.  The latter is not so complimetary as the

yours is not closely related to the person behind the keyboard.
But still, 'tis better to have encountered you than not.

Sorry, simple contradiction does not an argument make.
