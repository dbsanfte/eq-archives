Yep.  As I recall, in networked Doom, if you used any of the cheat codes, 
everyone else would get a little message to let them know you'd done it, 
so they could decide not to play with you anymore.  But sometimes, they're 
very fun when you're just playing against the machine and want some of the 
ol' ultraviolence.  Or when you're testing new levels you just made.

of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of
attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the
overabundance of information sources that might consume it."
