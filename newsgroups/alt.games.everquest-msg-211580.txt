Just to clarify.  There are two "Harmony" spells.  There used to be
just one.  The old spell was an area of effect spell that would never
be resisted.  Sometime around PoP, they made it so Harmony wouldnt
work on high level mobs and forced you to purchase a new spell,
Harmony of Nature.  Harmony of Nature can be resisted and is single
target, but it works on higher level mobs up to level 65.

When Harmony of Nature is resisted, it aggros on me almost every time
(on rare occaisions it has not).  Many times that means I get to eat a
death.
