Laws are applied on trees, not forests.

Yep.

A hate crime is a crime committed against a person because of
the group(s) to which that person belongs.  A random mugging of
a gay person isn't a hate crime;  a mugging of someone because
they're gay is.

To re-summarize my opinion:  It's wrong to include "hate crimes"
as a separate category of crime.  Why?  Because detailed inspection
of the motive isn't relevant to conviction.  It's enough to know
they had a motive.  We don't want people convicting based on their
prejudices.  A hate crime, for instance, can be applied as easily
to black-on-white crime as white-on-black, correct?  How many
juries in rural Alabama are going to convict on hate crimes (with
stricter punishment) than "normal" crimes?

Bring it in as a special consideration to be considered at the
time of sentencing.  That allows consideration of it outside the
realm of determining guilt, at a phase where the guilty will be
punished anyway.  Specification of a hate crime when charged
invites prejudiced juries to convict *or find innocent* people
based on the popularity of their hate, not on the facts of the
crime.

It's a fine line, but it's a line anyway, and one I don't think
we should cross.
