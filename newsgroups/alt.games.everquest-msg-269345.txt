The problem I've found is you are total dependant on your mana, if that
runs out your buggered. If the creature starts to resist spells you can
end up in trouble very quickly. I've had creatures nearly dead and my
health in green but my mana ran out and I was the one that ended up
dieing!! My shaman is totally useless at melee attacks. If the creature
starts to resist spells you can end up in trouble very quickly.
