That "pathetic state" wasn't understood until the early ninties when the
USSR collapsed.  At the time, economists were spouting about the moral
equivleancy (or superiority) of communism, and explaining how it was a more
viable economic system than lazie-faire capitalism.  Many conservatives felt
that they were "on the loosing side of history," even as they stood their
ground.  To almost everyone, it was amazing when the wall came down, and
then the USSR collapsed.  Very few expected that.

In the end, it turned out that Reagan's "arms race" was nothing but a ploy
to overclock the Soviet economy.  He was one of the few that understood the
folly of communism.

Yes, and it's most apparent when we attempt to emulate the failed policies
of the Soviets and Europe.
