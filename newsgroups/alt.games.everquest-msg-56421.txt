okay an example of multiquesting that i see more often.  Say your in
South Karan and you get a Aviak charm to drop.   You have a friend in
your guild or whatever that has a warrior that doesn't have crafted
gauntlets yet, and is really two low to hunt in SK, but he can afford
the gems for the quest.  you turn in the charm, he turns in the gem and
gets the crafted gauntlets from the quest npc.  This can also be done
with no drop items and people frequently do it with things like Jboots,
ie High level kills AC and gets ring, turns in ring, low level turns in
money, gets Jboots.
