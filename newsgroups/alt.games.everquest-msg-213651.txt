That's basically what I'm talking about.  I wouldn't go around EQ
slinging my name and email address to everyone I meet.  However, there
are a select few that might earn that privilige over time.  

I think it's much easier to meet in person first.  Let me explain.  If
I go to a Fan Faire or just accidentally meet someone while out and
about that I liked who also played EQ, it would make a big difference
in the game.  You are playing EQ with someone that you have actually
met and got along with.  You have one up on most people in the game
who you don't even know.  I'm just curious if these types of
friendships can progress OR if they turn into some delusion with one
or the other party thinking they have made a real friend when they
have not.
