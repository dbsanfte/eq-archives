I'm pretty sure that the bad sound isn't a result of low quality in
the source files, but rather poor coding of the sound generating
routines in the game.

Having a CPU pegged wouldn't really bother me, if the performance of
the engine was much better. Since I can't shell out of the game
anyway, it might as well use all of the CPU. I just want much smoother
performance as a result.

In fairness to EQ, this isn't a very valid comparison. From what I
understand of UT (I haven't played it myself), the amount of
information it has to track, graphics-wise, is much much smaller than
EQ. The 'zones' aren't as large, they don't contain as many active
players, they don't have MoBs, etc.

But still, your point is well taken.

City zones, while often the most stunning, are disappointing
performance wise. They're still worth seeing, though. In the outdoor
zones, I've only rarely noticed any performance problems.
