Yes.

No.

The problem with AoE bard songs is that the monk can come
within range of the song without bringing the mob within
aggro range of the group/raid.  When that happens, the song
heals/buffs/whatever while the monk is standing.  When the
monk feigns, the mob 'forgets' him and goes after the bard
who healed/buffed/whatever the monk while he was standing.

I'd guess the same is true for songs which pulse, where the
monk can go pull on the first pulse of three, then have the
second or third pulse hit while he's standing and transfer
aggro that way if he feigns as well.
