They are not sure if they are going to implement that in game, banks
may be global in the end.

Yes Sony can and probably will kill EQ, why because they OWN it. They
have not 1, not 2 , but 3 new mmorpg's coming out that demand much
more support. First off , if your someone that never played EQ and EQ2
is out why buy old one if your computer can handle new EQ2, I've
already seen people in this Newgroup say they are leaving EQ when SWG
goes live.just go to the Dev forum and look at the question from
everbody and you know they are EQ peeps . Planes of Power will problay
be the last Expansion for EQ, consider the fact that most of the
people that worked on it where shipped over to EQ2. This won't happen
overnight mind you, the other games won't come out for a year so I
personally give Old EQ 1 and a half to 2 more years of life with maybe
( big maybe ) one more expansion.But get ready to merge server ( and
knowing Sony at a cost ) .
