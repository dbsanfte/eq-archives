I can think of nothing more horrid. You'd like people who at least
know what they're talking about.. triple-box, 100 hour or no.. a rep
from a GoD/Time level guild on each server will at least know what
they're talking about when it comes to the content having lived it
both in raiding and in grouping and at least draw more respect than
someone who just dinged 60.
