I think that was DT's question. :)  I used the /loadskin window and had Use
INI button pushed down.  I have no freaking clue what that button was for,
but I didn't want to chance having to fix my damned windows and fade level
again.  It didn't work (no duh)...brought me back to default, but thankfully
without screwing up my windows.

Typing /loadskin dan 1  (same as /loadskin dan true) I got my custom UI back
up.  I only use 3 mods though.
