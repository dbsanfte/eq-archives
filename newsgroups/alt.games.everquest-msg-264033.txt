Ah, so if I wanted to be truly deceptive, I should make my alias Peter 
J. VanHousten, posting from pjvanhousten@telus.net. And thus you'd find 
me more credible. 

I can do that if you'd like. But it still wouldn't be me.

You see the posters 'posting under their real name', aren't necessarily 
doing anything of the sort. Unless you try and look up their home phone 
number, and cross ref it to the geographical locale of their posting ip 
and find a match. But what if you don't find a match? Do you assume that 
they are they the most devious trolls and cowards? Or perhaps they're 
just living with their girlfriends...

Meanwhile, I'd have to question one's own sanity if one felt compelled 
to root through someones posting history, online phone books, message 
headers, etc just to try and justify a silly point. (Recall that this 
branch was precipitated by Ross who was looking to 'prove' that I have 
never seen the outside of a.g.e, which itself was in defense of the 
silly dick-waving proposition that his newsgroup was a 'bigger fish'.

At any rate, I like '42'. Its more honest than Peter J VanHousten; 
there's no pretense its a real name. I'm not trying to fool anyone.

Plus its a reference to Douglas Adam's work, and coincidently a trivial 
cypher for my initials. (All of which is already known to anyone who's 
actually read my posts as '42', and cared to remember of course.)

Or simply wish to limit their exposure to the 'kooks'.
