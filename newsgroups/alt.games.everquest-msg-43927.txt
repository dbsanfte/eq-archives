My ZoneAlarm log shows 11.

(1700 * 16)  / (12 * 3600) = (approximately) 0.62 hits a second

Gosh, I am so worried about the performance loss of less than one connection a
second. And you expect me to dedicate hardware to this? Maybe for a company this
is acceptable, but I'l go have my daily Mocha Almond ulta Espresso Elite Pro and
consider it money better spent.

For the simple reason that I am not fucking with leased equipment. @home tech
support is enough of a pain in the ass already. Just because I know how to
program a router doesn't mean I am experienced enough that I am 100% sure I won't
make a mistake and have to spend the next 3 days on the phone with @home
employees accustomed to dealing primarily with people who don't know enough to be
dangerous, the whole time without internet access at all, as I long ago abandoned
the fuss of dealing with POTS modems and sold off my old USR 56k internal for 10
bucks.
