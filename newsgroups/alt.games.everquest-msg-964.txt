The rule seems to either be:

Low member's level x 1.33 or
High member level x .66  (I think this is correct).

A level 29 x .66 is about 20, so yes, they'd share xp.  Not much, especially
after the upcoming changes (if I read it right), but some.

Until level 18 or so I'd go with 3 levels between low & high.  In the 20s, 5
levels.  Thirties, 8 levels, and 40s, 15 levels (preferably 10).

My highest is level 47 and I try to avoid grouping with anyone above level
54 but I might be overly paranoid.
