My first char was level 6 when i bought SoV, just to get the GUI 
enhancements. We can mention the see-through inventory (pretty sure you 
had to go into the "windowed" mode to see inventory earlier), ability to 
run all windows in the same screen resolution ("windowed" mode was 640 * 
480, to your screen had to switch mode every time you wanted to see your 
inventory). And of course the new velious graphics dont work without SoV.
