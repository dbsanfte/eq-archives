Ahh.  So what, exactly, does it take for a rule to be real, I wonder.  It 
is true that newsgroups tend to transcend the jurisdictions of civil 
authorities.  I assume you would accept laws as 'real rules'?  Does it 
follow that a rule is real if society attempts to enforce it in some way?

There do exist 'rules' regarding newsgroup posting.  They appear in the 
oft-quoted RFC 1855.  They appear in several netiquette guides.  And they 
also appear in the FAQs of many newsgroups, including this one.  You are 
quite free to argue that these rules are not 'real'.  They are not, after 
all, obviously enforced.  No one will take you to court for breaking them.  
You will face no stiff fine, jail term, or other 'real' penalty.

You will, however, be forced to endure boring threads like this one about 
the virtues of the rules.  Is that not punishment enough?

There is no 'real rule' that one should throw out the nearly-empty milk 
carton, rather than putting it back in the fridge.  There is no 'real 
rule' about putting the seat back down in the lavatory.  Your girlfriend 
may still grumble at you for not doing so, though.  And make fun of you to 
your friends and hers.  Is it worth it?

}and since most pay for the
}connection and thus have the right to decide for someone to claim the only
}proper way is "A" and anyone posting as anything else is "insert insultive
}here" is nothing more than childish banter.

You're right.  Posters pay for their connections, and readers mysteriously 
get them for free, hence readers have no right to dictate the manner in 
which posters post.

Oh wait.  Readers pay for their connections too.  Maybe you're not so 
right after all.

}I've also seen an increase in
}the claim that if you dont provide a working but anti-spam email address
}your a few other choice names. A simply stupid idea being the hsitory and
}attitude of the party's in some of the newsgroups. Nothing more than some
}trying to define what they think is the right way for it to be.

*Shrug* I've seen very few complaints about not working email addresses.  
Mine works, is not munged, and I delete over 100 spam emails a day.  
That's the risk I chose to take.  I wouldn't require others to take it, 
since I can always respond to them in the group, if I so choose.

Graeme correctly said:
}> Actually, bottom posting or interleaving your reply is the generally
}> accepted norm for this particular newsgroup.

Not only is it the accepted norm, as Graeme points out, it is even 
included in this newsgroup's FAQ.  It is a very good FAQ.  I highly 
recommend giving it a reading before posting further.
