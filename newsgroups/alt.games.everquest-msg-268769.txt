This is the nature of a progressive game, and will be as true in EQ2 and WoW
as it was in EQ1.  The best gear a L30 has ever seen will be trash to a L50.
It's unknown how the high-end will play out, and whether the best gear of
a solo L50 will be trash to a grouping L50, whose gear will be trash to a
raiding L50.

More likely, they'll add levels to continue the progression before it becomes
that obvious.

Umm, that's a bad reason to switch games.  There are good reasons, which may
apply, but keeping up with the joneses in an MMORPG is simply a lost cause
unless you have infinite time.  In EQ2, 14 is about 1/20 or less of the way
to 33, much like EQ1's L58 is about 1/10 of the way to high-end (level 68-70,
200 AAs, most spells and decent non-raid gear).

If you're not dedicating your life to the game, don't bother to compare
yourself with those who are.  If you think EQ2 will be more fun, then by all
means switch to it.  If you think you'll never catch up in EQ1, get used to
the idea that you also will never catch up in EQ2, or WoW, or most any other
progression-based game.   Find a way to have fun at whatever level you play,
you'll enjoy whatever game you're in far more.
