1. Grouping with random players is risky, no doubt.  But not all pickup
groups involve unknown players.
2. For classes that do not solo well there are very few good solo spots
and they are usually taken (ex: soloable undead camps tend to be well
known to Paladins, Clerics, and gimp Necros), availability cuts both
ways.
3. When you have to walk everywhere you go, and the potential soloable
camps are widely spaced, it can easily take an hour just finding a spot
where you can be "next".

I'll agree that it is possible to find a group that's worse than [fill
in the blank, there's always some collection of idiots somewhere worse].
But with a weak solo class, like Paladin, that just gives you an easy
rule of thumb when you aren't sure if it's worth staying in the group:
when group xp over time is less than triple solo Paladin xp it's a
pretty safe bet that the group or the zone or the other players in the
zone sucks, in any of those cases there's little point in staying.
