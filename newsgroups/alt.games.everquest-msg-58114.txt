Lol, i love how you resort to such silly childish insults, as if it
reinforces your point any more.

What does my monk have to do with a comment I post about cheal?  Get over
it, geez are you jealous or something?

As for your guess, sorry to say your wrong.  56 Cleric, so I would say I
know a thing or 2 about cheal and what gets cleric agro or not.

LOL, let me ask you now.. have YOU leveled a cleric to 50+?   Get a clue ok,
cheal is more mana efficient on a warrior then celestial heal will EVER be.
As for the agro, bs does it always.  If the cleric doesn't cast full heal
too soon, and doesn't immediatly sit right next to the mob after giving an
early cheal, the chances of cleric agro are greatly reduced.

> just never been partnered with a good one, but it's low aggro, keeps

It does have its uses, im not disagreeing with that.  On a tank though, no
it doesnt.  The only time celest would be used for a tank is if they needed
a heal within the first 10 seconds of the fight (i.e weren't healed from the
previous fight) because a cheal so early on WILL get the cleric agro.

>Clerical fear isn't an option, so "fear  kiting" is out of the question for
a >cleric/warrior twosome.

Do you read? I said a RANGER and cleric.  And i quote "Also, if you had been
a ranger with the cleric (could fear kite) i bet the cleric wouldn't even
use 1/10th of the mana all those celestial heals burnt up."

No, you just don't know how to read it seems.

So answer the question, what level is your 50+ cleric?

going on)
