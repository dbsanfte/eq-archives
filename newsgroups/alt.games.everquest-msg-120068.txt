For your necro:

Base mana, according to castersrealm, at 200 INT is 546.
With 210 INT, it would be 604, for a gain of 58 INT.   If
you can med to full at 200 INT, then put on an extra 10
INT item, you *should* see the mana bar suddenly be
58/546 (10.6%) less than it should be.   Ten percent of the
mana bar is half a bubble, correct?   So, if you drop half a
bubble, that calculation is correct.   (To within the accuracy
of observing the pixels, of course.)

The other way is to calculate it by casting a spell which can
be chain-cast.   Count the number of times you can cast it
from a full mana bar with 200 INT, med back to full at 210
INT, and then count the number of times you can cast it
again.   The difference, roughly, between the two counts
multiplied by the mana cost of the spell would be the mana
gained by adding the 10 INT.

For your necro, casting Deadeye (35 mana, insta-refresh) and
switching immediately to Sense the Dead (5 mana, insta-refresh)
when you can't cast Deadeye anymore, you should be able to
get close to a "real" value.

The "problem" with that is standing mana regen rate and the
low cost of Deadeye for granulation checks would mean some
variance but it would still be pretty close, IMO.

(You could do the same with your druid, of course, but you have
to watch specialization savings even for the ones capped at 50
skill.)
