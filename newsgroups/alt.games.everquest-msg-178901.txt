Twilight of the Gods
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Insania 20 14

We've thrown away our former gods
Controlling our day
We have created better ones
So we control the way

We are the ones with the power
To hold down the enemy
Our gods are perfection
And they are protecting our lives
We still need some more of them
To be safe from the other side
As long as we're stronger
Nothing will happen to us

Fireflash in the night
Just an evil dream
Holy war in the sky. . . .never

Insania 20 16

Error in store 103
We watch the sun at night
The pretty gods we've built ourselves
Now terminate our lives

Silicon brain powered voices
Are crying "attack" tonight
In anger, burning our world
Doomsday has come
And there is no place to hide away
The future is over
And there is no turning back

Fireflash in the night
Now reality
Holy war in the sky. . . .

Chorus
Twilight of the gods
Insania's dead and gone
Another world was born
But the twilight soon will come

Fireflash in the night
Now reality
Holy war in the sky

Chorus
