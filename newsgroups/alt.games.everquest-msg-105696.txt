And some of us have administered commerical news servers AND know EQ.  
Having in-depth technical knowledge about rather obscure text-based 
information exchange tools used to indicate that you also knew how to find 
information and how to at least look at a couple posts in the group you 
were posting to.

Most posters here are aware of the reputation of battlenet.  One of the 
reasons for playing EQ for many people is the integrity of the game.  A 
number of posters here came from UO, which I hear was almost destroyed by 
various cheats and dupes.  We are aware that other games were damaged by 
cheats, and have heard of the DoS attacks.  That hasn't happened in EQ, 
and hopefully never will.

My point is that they have both caused the same amount of disruption to 
Everquest servers, zero.  She's not a total newbie.  She is a usenet 
junkie, I assume she knows how to search Google/Deja, and she most likely 
knows that you should read the FAQ AND scan a few posts before posting.  
This isn't some babe in the woods here, this is someone who seems to be 
very familiar with Usenet.

As far as anyone knows, there are no exploit programs.  There have been 
several functions moved server-side to stop minor cheats; random is a 
prime example.  You can't alt-tab out because Verant doesn't want you to 
do so.  It's been discussed and discussed here.  If you want to write a 
cheat program for EQ, it's just as easy to sniff the packets from a second 
computer.  Or run EQW.

Probably because EQ is so free of cheating, duping, and griefing.  Hell, 
you should see us turn on the PvP folks, even the EQ PvP folks.  We like 
having a game that works, and doesn't allow you to just write a script, 
and come back as god in 4 hours.

Or just read the FAQ.  Or just read a couple posts.  Not only does she 
start a 100+ post thread, she has stalkers and sycophants follow here 
here, and she continues some totally unrelated pissing match.  Looks 
green, smells bad, talks in ughs and duhs.  I think it's a troll.  :)
