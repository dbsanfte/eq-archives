So what you're saying then is that you don't have a job in
computer security or system administration?  ;)

Without any scheme at all in place for security, I wouldn't
be at all surprised to learn a good number of EQ accounts
have the password "password" and that a significantly higher
number have a password that's shared with at *least* one
account.  In fact I'd be willing to bet that there's a *significant*
number of accounts with passwords shared with more than one
other account.

Then figure in that the majority of players just hit the Enter
key when they get to the server select screen and you see
someone pop-up on into someone else's character without
any random chance of missing it once they get that far...
