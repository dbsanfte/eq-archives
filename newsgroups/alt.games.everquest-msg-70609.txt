Well, that's a separate issue. EverQuest has never been very good as a
RPG--maybe better than anything else out there, but still really bad.
It's not structured like a RPG. Static spawns and static quests make
for a VERY limited RPG.

As a philosophical point, I believe that a simulation like a video
game should either be a faithful representation of what it's
simulating or else allow you to do things that you wouldn't be able to
do without it. In neither one of these is EQ a successful RPG. You are
greatly limited in the flexibility or dynamic content. The advantage
that most video RPGs has--the ability to play alone--is lost in
EverQuest to a large extent. If you want to play with your friends for
most of the game, you need more people, not less.

Also, there is no game benefit to most RP actions and often a very
real penalty. If I want to RP my rogue as a good and loyal member of
the rogue's guild, I can kiss my epic goodbye (no pp'ing the GLs for
me.) If I want to play my Iksar as distrustful of mammals and
preferring the company of my own kind, I would never get to group with
a cleric, an enchanter, or even a rogue. RPing cripples your ability
to advance in the game.

A good OLRPG should at the very least (1) reward role playing and make
it harder to advance if you don't RP, (2) be dynamic and flexible, and
(3) facilitate one or more aspect of RLRPGs. EverQuest does none of
these things. As an RPG, it would have been far less playable than it
is now.
