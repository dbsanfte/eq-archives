As a fellow caster, I have to agree. I have noticed both points I have put 
into it so far- my next purchase is SCM3.

The net effect is to add to your mana regen. Just play like a cleric and

Spell haste helps a lot when you are tossing lots of mezzes around too I

For me, I REALLY wanted out of Baroness. I play my froglok as a male, but I 
*so* wanted the black-and-white model, and it only comes without dangly 
bits :( Baroness was not making me very happy.
