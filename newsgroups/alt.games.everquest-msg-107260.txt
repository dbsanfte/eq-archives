I have no real intention of doing the epic with my wizard so I don't know
how rare Quillmane is, but I DO know that the Grimblox (whatever) camp in
SolA is a cake walk.

Two days ago a guildy started her epic.  When she got to SolA she had to
wait 30 minutes.
Last night my best friend started hers as well.  Went to SolA.  Had to wait
a whole hour.

Your cleric had a lot of buffs to trade for it.  Even if you were a jerk you
could have traded.  What's a wizard have?  Cash and a DS.

It was one KS of a critter of totally NO USE to Mechanical except xp.
ASSUMING THE KS WAS INTENTIONAL (and I'm NOT stipulating that it was) then
GET OVER IT ALREADY.  Jesus Christ it was one fucking spawn.  Mechanical is
being a SERIOUSLY anal asshole about this whole thing.

Should she have purposely KSed?  No, of course not.  Should we give a fuck
that she did?  No.  Who cares?
