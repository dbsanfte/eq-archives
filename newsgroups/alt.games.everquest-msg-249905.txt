And i don't buy the fact that platinum is a scoring mechanism. It may
be a dick-measuring contest by the participants.. but you win nothing
having more.. it is used in no contents in-game, and is simply a
quantitative figure denoting how much cash your character has.

By that measure.. are you implying that Donald Trump has beaten you in
life cause he has and spends more money then you will probably see in
your lifetime?

PP score.. you know how obsessive that sounds? If someone comes to me
and says they have 4 million pp on their account my response is.. good
for you. Does it mean i feel the need to get 4,000,001 pp to make sure
i can thumb my nose at them as being 'better'? No.. because i'm not
that way. Mainly because the accumulation of pp isn't what i consider
a contest because both people have equal opportunities to accumulate
as much pp as they can. Trying to beat someone to a spawn for drops?
That's a contest because only one group can have it. But the
accumulation of pp can be done by anyone with the will and the work.

So i suppose when the US bails out Mexico and loans them lots of funds
that means Mexico doesn't have a 'real' economy? All you are adding is
another source of capital into the enviornment. If you want to make an
analogy.. Everquest is a huge island with its own monetary system. It
doesn't allow any other monetary funds to be used, and a black market
has arisen by people using boats to go to the US and get cash to buy
stuff with on the island. All that is being suggested is that an
official way be sanctioned whereby the two economies can be mated. Via
either an exchange rate or allowing the transfer of US dollars to the
island. Personally... given the option i'd say setup an exchange rate
of 1-1 of a new island specific currency and allow the use of that for
items. That then keeps the seperation while allowing people to invest
capital on the island.

And when you start to realize the economy of Everquest exists in the
real world, not some fantasy land in your mind, you'll realize these
things have gone far beyond just a simple 'game' analogy. The entire
Everquest economy takes up physical space in this world, the island
analogy is quite appropriate. That the island happens to sit on
Everquest servers.. and the space on their hard drives has been
annexed, partiitoned, and rules devised on item acquisition.. is
largely irrelevant. They are the same and as people get over the fact
that this just happens to be contructed in bits and bytes rather than
dirt, brick, and mortar.. we'll start to advance in what can and
cannot be done.

And that clear philosophical view is changing. Period. Fantasy rpgs
stopped becoming 'fantasy' when they moved off paper to the computer
and full economies were constructed to support them.

Its very relevant. Its as relevant as any other economy in this world.
Economies have good times of strong growth.. and economies have bad
times of stagnation and inflation. You think the Russian economy is
doing cartwheels at the moment? After all.. you can take as much USD
into that economy as you desire. Just the simple allowing of USD to be
transferred to the EQ island doesn't mean the economy will grow or
even be strong as a result because people have to want to actually
invest in that economy and play the game..

Ya.... but that would happen now. If unemployment in RL shoots through
the stratosphere, subscriptions fall through the floor.. plat becomes
scarce as it is consumed.

What people do with the game within the game rules should be their own
choice.

>Billy finds an exploit and generates 60,000,000,000,000pp

Wonderful things happen when anonymity goes away. Billy finds an
exploit, doesn't report it, and tries to use it for his benefit..
Billy gets banned. And banning a Gaming Account from use in EQ is not
the same as banning an EQ account as we know it since it ties into
Billy's real life identity. As such, he cannot just setup a fresh
gaming account and come back in game. He gets banned, he stays banned.

>and then spends the next year trying to pull it out of EQ without

A flag system could be constructed similar to what the SEC uses for
suspect stock trading. Once a red flag gets raised, transfers on the
accounts are frozen while an investigation examines the account to
determine if rules were broken... and if they were a penalty occurs
whether that requires a black flag against access for a period of time
or a fine against the EQ account can be raised. With back-end
penalties that actually hurt... someone will be very hesitant about
trying to run an exploit for pp.
