Well i have no issues with the 9700 pro under any DX9 game, and i dont 
believe there are any (which havent been corrected by a driver update), if 
this was true then you would either see a product recall or class action 
lawsuit against ATI.   As i can play all the DX9 games and i can use all the 
features of DX9 through tests such as, and not limited to 3dMark2003, i 
would call this a proper DX9 card, hardly a marginal one.   If it was an 
issue i would just buy a new card.

Also note that at the time period the 9700 was released almost every 
hardware site hailed it as best card currently available, for image quality, 
stability, performance etc.   Surely if the card had issues it would have 
appeared there.

 When i play EQ i either play at 1280x1024 (i could goto 1600x1200 but the 
monitor will only show it in 60hz) with everything maxed out and depending 
how long im going to be on, i will have FSAA on 2x/4x.  Either way i get the 
fog since the new patch.

Back on subject, i wouldnt worry to much about the graphics card SIRG, if 
you have a TI4200 or above at the moment that should be adequate.   I placed 
my nephews x800xt into the system to play EQ and there was almost no 
difference in framerate, although you could have a higher AA on, which made 
things look better, the system then was using a 2100xp cpu.  Im now using a 
A643400+ cpu (with the 9700)and i have noticed a big frame rate gain from 
this, rather than the GPU.  Seems the engine might be CPU limited at the 
moment.
