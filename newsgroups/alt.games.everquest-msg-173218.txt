I think the difference is in the strength of the beast, and the 
unwillingness of other world powers.

Saddam has no supporters, and those countries around him would love for 
the UN to get rid of him. He has possible ties to Osama. He has no nukes 
that we know of, but might have soon. He is a loose cannon, but wants to 
look like the good guy to his people.

North Korea on the other hand doesn't care if they look like a good guy 
or not. They are pretty strong militarily, and they know it. They have a 
million man army, and a very strong Air Force. They are extremely close 
in location to China, Japan, and (duh) South Korea. They have nukes, and 
if pressured too far might use them. They must be dealt with carefully. 

I don't think it is fair to try to equate the two.
