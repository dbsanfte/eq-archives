Yes, the lawyer is to blame for the mess, however, the lawyer states that
Verant is fiscally responsible for the actions.  She herself has admitted
her son had some problems, and last I heard, most family members do take
some concern about their own relatives issues if they believe it was life
threatening unless they felt no obligation to help them.

What this mother is doing, while under the auspicies of trying to get
'information' suggests she did not really give a damn about the situation
until her son died.  It almost smacks of 'money-grubbing' because now she
wants "warning signs" put onto a game she accuses was partly responsible
for her son's suicide.  I mean, this is almost like the whole McDonald's
Coffee thing, where an old lady sued McDonalds to put a warning label on
the damn coffee cups.  While she did get third degree burns, the fact that
you are ordering hot coffee suggests it is going to be hot, so should we
start putting warning signs for something that should be common sense?

As someone else posted, the Kunark Box states "addicting", which suggests,
*gasp* that it might be addicting.  The mother herself said her son had
irregular attitude prior to EQ, and the warning signs were there, yet she
chose to ignore it, and now wants Verant to 'own up' to it.  That's just
plain wrong, it is right up there with the parents who bought Mortal Kombat
in the 80s and 90s for their kids and then complain about the content when
it is literally WRITTEN on the box what was involved.
