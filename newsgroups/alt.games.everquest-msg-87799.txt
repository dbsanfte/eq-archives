My choice would be Warrior, Monk, Druid, Enchanter. True, that druid won't 
get rezzes, but up until about 30 or 40 he is a competitive healer in 
regards to a cleric, and much more versatile to boot. Additionally, this 
druid/chanter combo allows for clarity and regen, which is almost as good 
as having a bard around for downtime.

The standard tactic- monk pulls and "dies" at the warriors feet. The 
warrior takes over aggro with taunt, while the druid DSes the warrior and 
the chanter tosses out hastes or mezzes. When the mob begins to flee (Flee? 
Ha! Enjoy snare, monkey boy!) the warrior finishes it off while the monk 
goes hunting.

Just my 2 copper.
