I still have bad sound when running and when casting.
All other sounds are ok. The funny thing is that my onboard
soundcard (SoundMAX) is much better than my SoundBlaster 128 card.
And the SoundMAX is not among the supported cards. Only reason I
bought the SoundBlaster was to be sure that the sound would work in eq..
