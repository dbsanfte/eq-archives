Yep, essentially you'd get the best stats of your epic and your best
"weapon of the moment" combined.  Too powerful?  Maybe.  But
something along those lines would be a welcome change from "man
I worked like a dog for this... guess I can use it to hunt in crushbone"

Lazy bards don't wring every last bit of power out of the class.  Good drums
will increase your damage output via chant by half again, other instruments
also see increases in their song types.  SSS is at its best with voice
songs, where the fact that its not as powerful as amplification is
compensated for by not having to keep that song up, sacrificing one
song per 9.

There you go, thats the spirit!
