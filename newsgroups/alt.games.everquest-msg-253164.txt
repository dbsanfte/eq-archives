Yup, 9 times out of 10 if it isn't a guild group and in a higher level
area... its anything but need before greed. It just a way for some
people to try to cut down on the number of people they have to roll
against and increase their odds of being able to sell an item to buy
gear they really want. I loathe Need Before Greed outside of guild and
in particular those that try to push it on a pickup group. Inside of
guild? Hell ya give it to a guildie if its an upgrade.
