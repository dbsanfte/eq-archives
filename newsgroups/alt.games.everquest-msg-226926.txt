In most of the LDoN groups I've been in *noone* wants to loot.  My ranger often
gets stuck with it, my cleric won't because she's usually too busy.  Inevitably
the corpse is either in the wall with just his toe sticking out or a *ghost*
you can barely get a lock on, (even locking on their names is hard sometimes).
I always make it a point to thank the person who does the looting.
