Nothing stopping the company suing in small claims for monetary dammages.
Nothing stopping the company for swearing out a warrant for theft by
deception. The way that is written makes me think that the defrauded company
is really a single guy with no buisness experience trying to run a small
buisness that everyone hates so he cant even ask for advice.

In other words all options have not been attempted yet.

p.s. The eula is worth exactly the paper it is written on (sarcasm). The
reason sony dosent shut down plat sellers is that they cant. They tried and
suceeded with ebay briefly but then someone said sure we will fight in court
and it was all over.
