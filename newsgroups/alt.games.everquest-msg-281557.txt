I had a strange (to me) situation arise tonight, and wanted to see
if anyone else has had this happen.

I was running a 29 SK with a couple of 30s in the Mistmoore graveyard.
(Taking advantage of the reversion of MM to its previous occupants.)
At one point someone fell through the hole in the mausoleum and ended
up training out the room.  The other two of us didn't realise quite
how bad it was and ran up to help (at that point he'd just said he was
rooted) so we had a wipe: puller died, cleric managed to gate out, and
I feigned death.  Or so I thought at the time.

I did notice that I had the Screaming (mez) icon while I was feigned,
but didn't think about that at the time.  My monk is able to feign even
while mezzed, so I'm used to seeing the combo.  Though I did wonder a
little why the mez hadn't interrupted my casting.  Anyway, I lay there
while the mobs gradually dispersed.  One mob stayed nearby, though, so
I couldn't stand up.  I did risk opening a tradeskill container and
making a bit of food while I was waiting; that didn't seem to break
the feign.

A little while later, the courtyard began to repop.  Just as I was
starting to remark on this, the mobs jumped me.  I joined the corpse
run crew. :-)  But I couldn't figure out why they'd attacked while I
was still feigned.

Well, looking at the log, I see my feign spell.  While I was casting
it, a mob began to cast a spell.  My feign went off, but a few seconds
later the spell hit me and broke the feign.  But the spell was a mez.
So the feign cleared aggro, and the spell didn't undo that because
mobs won't aggro on a mezzed PC.  When the mez wore off, apparently
they were starting from scratch as far as aggro, and I guess they were
all far enough away that they just headed back to their room.  The one
that stayed behind was the caster himself, I think.  His aggro to me
may've been in a particularly weird state.

And then, when the courtyard repopped, eventually one of those mobs
was close enough to notice me and the others then joined in.

So, has anyone seen something like this?  Does my interpretation of
the events sound right?

	-- Don.
