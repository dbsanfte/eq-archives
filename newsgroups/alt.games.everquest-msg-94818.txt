Yeah, but, on the other hand, there are cases like I've run into
quadding Ulthorks where someone pulls right through my path between me
and my pack and gets aggroed by part of my pull. I end up having to
run back and try to get the one that aggroed them to come back after
me, which usually works when I get closer because I'm higher on the
hate list. It's not a matter there of me controlling my pull, but them
controlling theirs. Doesn't matter to them, they bitch me out and tell
me to watch where I'm going anyway.
