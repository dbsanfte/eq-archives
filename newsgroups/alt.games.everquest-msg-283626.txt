That wasn't it - I just downloaded the trial, logged in then
restarted and it downloaded everything through GoD for me
(in 5 hours).  I knew about the 9.0c thing, and about the 
fact that the one I had probably didn't have the correct file,
so I'd already taken care of it.

Then I ran into the most appalling thing - I knew the luclin
models were oddly proportioned, and was ready for it.  What
I had forgotten was just how bad the animations were.  I made
a wood elf - and flat out couldn't stand my usual over-the-
shoulder veiw because I had to watch how he ran. 

Good god, did none of these guys ever run track or cross country?
That is not how people run.  Of course, as good as most of WoW's
movement is - there's still the issue of their horse models.  When
I first got my charger as a paladin I almost couldn't ride it - the
horse's butt was narrower that its shoulders by a HUGE margin.
Once again my first thought was "WTF, didn't these guys at least
LOOK at a horse before modeling it?"
