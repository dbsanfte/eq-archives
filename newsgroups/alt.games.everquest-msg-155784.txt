I warned you...but if I was not so dang frustrated with my current situation
I would not have posted here in newsgroups.

You obviously have not played on Bertox lately, I agree that a ranger can do
alot of melee dmg. I for one take pride in my abilities as a peeler and a
caster shield.

This sentiment seems to be the same one that is expressed on my server. I
have spend 2 years of my hard earned money (paying the fees not ebay
twinking) and time to get to the higher game only to hit a ceiling. I am
seriously considering dumping it all and leaving EQ. Let me ask this, do you
get to play 24/7 and do you have to work for the money to pay for your
account. (not meant as a jab, just a curious interest in your point of
perspective.)
