I've tried every trick offered here and on MS Knowledge base. None of
them ever worked on my systems. Those tips and tricks are not sure
fixes. If they were, MS would not list removing physical ram over 512
as a last resort.

Do you know anyone running Win98 with more than 512mb of physical
memory with no problems or glitches? If so, they are in the minority.
Hence my statement "almost impossible".
