Where can mid 50's hunt nowdays,without being overran by all the level 60's
coming out of the closet?It seems impossible to find a group anymore without
level 60's sucking all the exp.Don't get the wrong idea,I am glad verant has
givin the game a boost for the level 60 people(advance point system).I just
can't see spending 2 to 3 times the effort in making a level,compared to
normal.I was just wondering,if anyone has found a zone for the mid 50's to
hunt in and still have worthy exp.I have all the expansions and I'm on the
Quellious Server.
