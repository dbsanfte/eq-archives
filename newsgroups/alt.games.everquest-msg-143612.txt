Just play without a guild for a week or so on your server and I'm sure =
that you'll be in numerous groups with people asking you if you want to =
join your guild.  I played my rogue to lvl 35 before I joined a guild, =
but I was getting constant requests to join prior to that.

Perhaps it was my awesome playstyle, supurb character or ph4t l3wtz, =
either way I eventually decided upon a guild worthy of my m4d sk1llz =
recently.  Or just stay guildless unless you plan on doing raids etc. =
for the big lewts...  I've always thought it looked neat just to see a =
high level guy without a tag or last name. =20
