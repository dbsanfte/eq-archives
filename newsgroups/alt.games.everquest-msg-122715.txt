The only place I tend to have problems with mob's shot at Max range is
in Kunark.  I have seen it happen it FM, DL and LOIO.  Hit the mob at
the edge of it's range and it takes off running the other way like a
bat out of hell.  Forget catching it unless you are a bard, in which
case you didnt just fire an arrow at it LOL.

Eventually (usually around 5 minutes later while you are wrapped in a
new battle) it will return and attack.

I dont know if this is a problem with the Kunark coding or what.
