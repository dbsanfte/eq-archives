I play a bard, a damn good one too, I think, at least people have told me
that I am pretty good.  The other day I was grouping with a friend and his
roommate.  His roommate has a bard, a few levels beneath mine at the time (I
think I was at 41 or 42, and he was at 35 or 36) and I do what I always do
when I am in a group with another bard.  This is what follows:

"What songs are you planning on singing so that we get the biggest bang for
our buck?"

"Um, I don't know."

I roll my eyes and send a tell to my friend, "Is this is first character?"
and he tells me yes.  I roll my eyes a few times and then take a deep
breath.

"What songs do you have?  Do you have a mana song? or Catana of Soothing?"

"Where do I get those?"

"You're 35, and asking me where you get your mana songs?  Either go to
EQdiva.com or casters realm.  Catana of soothing is picked up in Ice Clad on
the first island in an igloo.  You're in a big guild, (number wise), ask
someone to pick it up for you, not expensive, if they are going through IC."

So the rest of the time grouping, I keep on getting tells as where to get
certain songs.  Hello, there are three bard guilds on Norrath, and one (2 if
you include Katta) on Luclin.  If you can't get a song in Kelethin, hop the
nexus high way to qeynos, and see if you can get it there, if not there then
selos on through to High pass, you might find a song there, if not, selo's
on over to Freeport.  With a drum, any drum, and at that level it's pretty
fast.

Folks, here's a clue (sorry, a bit annoyed), a bard should never, never,
never, ever be a first character.  In fact, I wouldn't even make them a
second character and before you go make a bard, research it.  Lyrral, is my
5th character, but more or less my main.  I have a cleric and warror on
different servers who I played before Lyrral and are high levels, but not
that I am mostly on Povar, I play Lyrral.  (With an occassional break to
Bristlebane or Lanys.)

It used to be that if you had a bard over level 20, you had to be at the
very least decent.  If you're bard hit 40, then you had to be at least good.
With PL'ing, and twinking (I saw a level 3 bard in SS the other day, almost
cried.) that's no longer the case.  Bards used to be an underrated rarity
(at least on Povar), now they are more common than woodelf druids
*shudders*, but it's nmot the end of  the world , I say to myself.  They
will get bored eventually.   They will give up eventually, and bards will go
back to being what they were.  A class played by devout fans.  One that
wasn't about getting the phattest loot, or the best experience, but instead
about playing a class that used to garner respect from players who had been
around for a while.

Okies, done ranting, thanks for listening :)
