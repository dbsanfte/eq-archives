    I feel sorry for you if that's the quality of player you're used to
encountering, /comfort. I'd go bonkers if I had to deal with that every time
I wanted XP.

    When I'm with my RL friends, goofing off on an alt, I am. They defer to
me, and I enjoy showing them stuff so when they group with others they can
anticipate problems before they explode. In the average guild group, though,
I enjoy being humorously entertaining and unassertive unless there's some
sort of problem. That shaman I used as an example - it took a while before I
asked him what he was doing and why he was doing it. I was hoping the group
leader would take it up with him.

    That still surprises me. You'd think, given the opportunity to see where
the group is deficient, the leader would at least make a decision that was
remotely useful ("casters OOM - STFU and play mana song!") and not actively
malevolent.

    Question, and I'm not copping an uber 'tude or anything by asking: would
you say most of your grouping experience comes at the lower end of the level
spectrum, or higher (50+)? I'm pretty sure your paladin is up there, but by
mentioning playing across six servers it's possible you play lower level
characters more often. The reason why I ask is this: most of my playtime is
with the 50+ crowd. By that point, most people have a clue as to what works
and what doesn't. If they don't, Darwin usually keeps them from the 50+ game
or at least fights a prolonged delaying action. At the lower end, though, I
could see someone being much more ignorant about really fundamental things.

    I never dread a new player, until they start to behave oddly.

    Another winner I remember was all the way back in my Sebilis days. Group
needed a snarer, a wizard was available, cool! The wizard said it was his
first time in Sebilis. I think it might have been his first time in a
dungeon. Would not snare, we were getting adds but so far nothing we
couldn't handle. When asked the wizard said the snare was AoE so it got him,
and it had a lot of aggro, and couldn't he just burn the mob down if it
started to run? No, please snare, you won't die from snare aggro, you will
die from trains. Then he starts stunning instead of snaring. Please snare,
um OK, but I know I can stun. Finally, we get past the doorway leading into
disco area and start pulling from the floor so we can move to the beetle
room or the stage. He doesn't snare, it runs around a corner before he can
get a spell off, and goes right into the middle of the repops behind us. We
barely manage to survive this massive train, which is lucky because he
doesn't have evac up either. When confronted, he wanted to know how often
we'd fight near corners, wasn't that a rare thing? At this point I told the
wizard to evac us to the zone line, and once that was done I had his arse
booted from the group. That's perhaps the only time I've had someone removed
from a group, for ignorance in the face of common sense.
