No.

I have enough friends that aren't idiots that I don't need to cower in fear of
possibly offending some moronic jackass that might be able to help me sometime
in the future (as if these people were ever the helpful type.)

The only way I would ever end up near him in PoH would be on a public raid,
and an cleric who refused to rez another raid member... well, first one of the
other 7 clerics would get it, second, it would be his last raid, more than
likely.   A couple of weeks ago we had an idiot cleric invited on a Hate raid
who refused to heal the ranger since the ranger wouldn't give him constant
updates on whether his mobs were up on tracking.   We were in the process of
arranging to translocate him out when he gated of his own accord, and he will
never be returning with us, nor any of the other guilds we are friendly with,
nor 2 of the 3 public raid leaders.  (the third public raid is run by one of
his guild members, so they might let him in there.)   I wonder if it was worth
it for him.
