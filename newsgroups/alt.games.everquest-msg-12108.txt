The time commitment needed is seriously huge. Want to do something like duck
over to another city to help a friend and it will waste a whole 3 hour
session easily just getting there.

That is assuming you don't get killed in any of a hundred different ways
enroute, and spend the next days session too on corpse recovery....

As you can see, it can be as frustrating as heck, but also because of this
intensity it can be a lot fun too - and addictive.

 I would recommend waiting for something better.
