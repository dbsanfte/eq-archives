My credit card has expired, and I need to change the number, my
account has been inactiveted already, so if I try to use the Change
billing button inside the games login screen, it just says that I dont
have a subscription. On station,sony.com I can see the subscribtion,
but I cant change cardnumber there either, couse it just says that I
cant change it until the account is closed.

Should I close the account and reregister for subscribtion? And where
do I do that? I cant see that anywhere on the webpage....

Please help if you have an idea, Id like to get back online soon.....
