I think the actual casino is somewhere in Shadowhaven, but I've
never been to it.

I was curious about the Highpass casino, though.  I talked to
Dealer Shonta there, and got the bit about how her table has
a 100pp minimum.  Not being the richest bloke on the block, I
wasn't willing to hand her 100 plat just to see what might
happen.  I looked at the other dealers and found I could open
them like merchants, but they had nothing for sale.

I checked Alla's for these folks, and didn't see anything about
what they're for.  Is there anything going on in that room, or
is it just there as a hunting ground for all the "evils" I see
lately coming through to kill the nobles?
