I was dreaming about something along those same lines, only for a new
'Swashbuckler' type zone made especially for Rogues and Warriors (much like
Unrest and Befallen are geared towards Clerics and Paladins).

Have an ocean cliff area just off the Qeynos Hills with narrow pathways
along the ledges that lead to hermit caves and a big pirate cove cavern.
Have treasure chests that rogues must lockpick, guarded by traps they must
disarm, and guards they need to sneak past.  Have a random spawn of a Pirate
ship that sails in and docks in the cove, unloading a crew of pirates
(potentially trapping any rogues trying to lockpick their treasure chests!)

Also have full scale player-manned ships that can sail over a wide ocean
area that have a pilot house, where one person can steer it just like a
canoe.  Those ships cannot zone, but can be used to hunt down the Pirate
ship spawn in-zone.  I can just see shiploads of Rogues and Warriors on the
high seas, their raipiers drawn, faces into the sea breeze......
