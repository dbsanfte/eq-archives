At 20, they're high enuff above you that literally nothing you throw at them
will stick. They run like the wind when not slowed too. And, if you gotta run,
make your turns wiiiide. I'd say as a druid, wait till around 32. Just my 2cp
here, but my main is now 42 and they are still dark blue to him. Almost no
resists now with the new resist system patch of last month. (finally!) Good
luck.
