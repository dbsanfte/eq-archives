Why are we going in game to kill mobs? I would like an /autocamp
feature, where I can sit myself down and kill mobs in a camp
automatically, loot them and wait for the next spawn.

That way I can come back and check through MSIE how my toon is doing
at the camp, and how much stuff I got. That way we won't be burdened
with actually playing the game, it can play itself....
