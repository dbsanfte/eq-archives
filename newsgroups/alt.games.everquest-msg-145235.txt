Touche.

But I did want to make a paladin, you know, its just that
the guild I was in needed a cleric and had tons of paladins
already.  Course that was two years ago, six guilds ago,
and this is my second cleric... turns out there's something
I like about clerics.

I suppose those tank wannabe rangers could be in the
same boat, wanted to play a tank but got caught up in
the ranger mystique.  I do know, having played a ranger
just to 10, that its incredibly hard to give up REAL
track, my druid and bard both cringe every time they
use their weenie version, and thats a LOT.
