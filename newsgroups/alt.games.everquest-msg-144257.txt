Messenger of the Queen, Paladin 2H Piercer from Crystal Caverns.
Worth about 20pp due to lack of demand and unimpressive stats
compared to, say the common as dirt Black Alloy Bastard Sword.
I'm not the only Paladin who had zero interest in raising <another>
melee skill from zero on the off chance I might maybe be able to
get Tantor's Tusk before I find something better that is 2HS or 2HB.

Kaev <--- who knows there are other ok 2HPiercers out there, and
doesn't much care.
