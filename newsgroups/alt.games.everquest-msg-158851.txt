As others have pointed out, it will take a lot of money and/or time to
get to a profitable level. However, one combination of skills apparently
makes a LOT of money at the top end.

One of my guildmates has a ranger for a main who is a grandmaster in
fletching. He created a gnome alt specifically to get up to a high
enough level in tinkering to make cams trivial. (Cams are used in making
high end bows.) Between the two characters, he apparently makes bows
which sell back to vendors for a *lot* more than the cost of making
them. He's made tens if not a hundred of thousands of plat that way and
bought some very high end gear upgrades for his ranger with the money. 
The secret apparently is to be able to tinker the cams yourself. If you
buy them off a fletching vendor they are so expensive that they cut the
profit margin on the bows to nill. 

Or, of course, if you have a high end tinker in your guild who's willing
to make cams for you "at cost" that will work just as well.

But be warned, it took a lot of time and cash for him to get up to the
high end of fletching skill.
