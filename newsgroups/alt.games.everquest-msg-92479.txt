EQ sucks for newbies since it gives next to no help at all and is 
positively hostile to beginners for certain race/class combos where 
guilds are miles away down dark tunnels and so on. The best thing you 
can do is play a human warrior or something like that for a bit until 
you get the hang of the controls and what you're supposed to do.

/shout and ask where the nearest newbie zone is, head for it and kill 
small things like rats & bats. Once you get enough experience you raise 
a level and get stronger and can kill tougher things. Sell pelts, silks 
etc. to afford new spells and better armour / weapons. Repeat.
