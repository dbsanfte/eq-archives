I had the same reaction you did reading this article. Legal quandary?? LOL. 
Some nutcase killed a human being. The victim wasn't an intruder on the 
property, this wasn't a burglary;  the murderer (Qui) went to the home of 
the victim (Zhu) and stabbed him in the chest because of some prior dispute 
(which happened to concern virtual property).  Whether or not there was a 
"theft" of property has no bearing on this intentional homicide. Case 
closed, no legal quandaries here. Move along.
