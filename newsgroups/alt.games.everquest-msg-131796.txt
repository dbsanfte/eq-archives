My guild is going on a raid to SolA Sunday.  I wanna go too, but
according to the plans you need to be at least level 30 to go.  Luckily,
I found out about this the day I joined the guild.  I've been grinding
almost non-stop whenever I'm on since Sat and have gone from 10 to 22. 
I know though that the level requirements are going to keep getting
harder though.  Will it be possible for me to reach 30 by Sunday,
playing 5 - 7 hours a night and probably 12 to 14 hours on Saturday?
