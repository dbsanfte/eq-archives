Well, for one thing, the defense has to be successful every time, the 
attack only needs to be successful once. If Russia were to develop (or 
even give convincing evidence that it may be developing) a new 
generation of missiles that could, by speed, decoy or stealth, get past 
ABM, they only need to build a dozen at the cost of millions to force 
the US to upgrade the whole system at the cost of billions.

There's the rub. You aren't rendering nuclear weapons obsolete, you are 
only rendering one particular delivery vector obsolete, and Russia sure 
as hell will not sit back and allow itself to be open to an attack that 
it could not retaliate against. Hell, chances are they would probably 
sell off that technology to god knows whom to recoup some of the costs.

The way to deal with nuclear weapons is getting *serious* about 
scrapping the whole lot of them, and then invest the money in 
intelligence and information gathering to make sure nobody gets around 
to making new ones. That's a much more worthwhile goal than any science-
fiction defense schemes.

See above.
