Also not too difficult...it would have either been a rogue or a warrior,
because both had a 5% experience bonus.  Also, halflings had a
5% exp bonus on top of that.  The rogue in question also had a perma-
group of RL friends, that grouped with him in SPITE of him being
a rogue (which was still nice at the time).  He had no trouble exp'ing
in the only two real 40+ zones in the game, Sol B and L. Guk.

When I saw my first epic'd vah shir rogue 2 weeks after Luclin
went live, I knew things were a bit better for any rogue made
post-Kunark...
