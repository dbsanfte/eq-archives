My advice: Dont try any of the expensive tradeskills (Jewelcraft is
probably *the* most expensive tradeskill there is to level up) until
you have at least one character over 50, perhaps 60.

Do that.

-Only buy the spells you need.  Ask around, find a friendly level 60
and ask him if you really need.  For example, looking at castersrealm,
you probably wont need the following level 34 spells to badly:

1) Fury
2) Shiefting Shield

...since you won't be meleeing much and your AC buff line is a joke
compared to others.

Also, you may not need:

1) Charm Animals
2) Scouge
3) Shock of the Tainted
4) Winter's Roar

...if you dont solo.  In groups, at your level, shaman begin taking on
a support role.  They dont actually do much damage to the MOBs, but
rather buff up everyone else, and debuff whatever they are fighting. 
Ask other shaman ahead of you and find out what they say though...I
personally havent played a shammy past level 16.

You have options, such as spider silks and crystal caverns (located in
Velious) groups (geonids = incredible cash for your level if you can
get a group for them.  Spiders there drop some pretty good loot and
sellable silks).  However don't bust your ass too much trying to
compete with all of those twinks out there.  Get the levels and the
cash will come later.  Certain gear does help you do your job better,
but you will find that groups will prefer a shaman with mediocre (by
twinked standards) gear but good skills and the right attitude a much
better partner than a moron twink who pisses everyone off.

...I made the mistake, with my first character, of tradeskilling at an
early level.  I wasted a few hundred plat (made by farming
*Blackborrow*, which aint exactly plat heaven) and got blacksmithing
up to maybe level 50 or so.  That represented a few days of
farming...My character was broke, almost naked, and missing half his
spells.  I had completely wasted my time on those tradeskills.
