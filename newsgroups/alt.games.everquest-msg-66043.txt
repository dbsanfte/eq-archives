Then again, you wouldn't have had those problems to start with if you
moderated yourself, played EQ two or three times a week, for an hour or two
per session, and kept track of your schoolwork and social life.  I know what
it's like.  I flunked out of my first year of university about 5 years ago
because I spent more time in bars and movie theatres with friends than
actually writing essays and studying.  I kinda got my act together, and
ended up graduating from a different school, despite going to bars and
playing EQ, and having sex with my girlfriend of the time, simply by
managing my time better and setting priorities.
