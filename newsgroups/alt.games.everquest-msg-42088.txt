Its amazing what you can find with 20.5 seconds in hotbot.

Excerpt of main part:

"The leader should present this color guard with the Flag which has
been selected for its
final tribute and subsequent destruction. The leader then should
instruct the color guard to
"hoist the colors". 
When the Flag has been secured at the top of the pole, the leader
comments: 

"This Flag hs served its nation long and well. It has worn to a
condition to
which it should no longer be used to represent the nation. 
"This Flag represents all of the Flags collected and being retired
from service
today. We honor them all as we salute one Flag."
The leader then calls the group to attention, orders a salute, leads
the entire group in the
"Pledge of Allegiance." and orders the Flag retired by the color
guard. 
Slowly and ceremoniously, the flag is lowered, then respectfully
folded in the customary
triangle. The Flag is delivered to the leader and then the group is
dismissed. This
concludes the Ceremony of Final Tribute. 

Ceremonial Burning

Fire and Flag Preparation: 
The burning of a Flag should take place at a campfire in a ceremony
separate from the Ceremony of Final Tribute. The fire must be sizable
(preferably having burnt down to a bed of red hot coals to avoid
having bits of the Flag being carried off by a roaring fire), yet be
of sufficient intensity to ensure complete burning. 

Before the ceremony begins, the color guard assigned to the Flag opens
up its tri-corner fold and then refolds it in a coffin shaped
rectangle. 

When all is ready: 

All assemble around the fire. The leader calls the group to attention.
The color guard comes forward and places the Flag on the fire. 
All briskly salute. 
After the salute, but while still at attention, the leader should
conduct a respectful
educational program as the Flag burns: e.g. singing of "God Bless
America"; offering an
inspiring message of the Flag's meaning followed by the "Pledge of
Allegiance"; performing
a reading about the Flag; reciting the "American's Creed"; etc. 
When the Flag is consumed, those assembled, with the exception of a
leader and the color
guard, should be dismissed. They should be led out in single file and
in silence. 
The leader and color guard should remain to ensure that the Flag is
completely consumed,
and to burn additional Flags, if any. 
The fire should then be safely extinguished.
