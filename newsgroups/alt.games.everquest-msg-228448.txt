And its worth pointing out that by "round 4" of the documentary, the 
author concedes that AMD dropped the ball, and that P4 is the better buy 
at the moment.

Like I said, when it was the Athlon XP 1900 and P4 1.9 you were dead on. 
AMD smoked intel to the point where it just didn't make sense to buy an 
intel (and which is why I bought the Athlon at the time :) ... but now 
the 3200 vs the 3.2 ... its a much more level playing field, with intel 
generally considered to be on top... for the moment at least.

-thanks again, interesting reading.
