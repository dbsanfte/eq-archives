No, it will never improve for a shaman, it is just an innate ability for 
all Barbarians.  Only players that choose a class that gets the bash 
skill will see improvement.  The only real use I have for it is the 
occasional interrupt of a caster it causes.  It is too unreliable for me 
to rely on it, but, it does help sometimes.
