"We" reffers to everyone who is not you. 

I say "We" because I identify with the logic of the people who posted.

I have not contributed because, like you, I am not at the level to take part in the trials. 

I am however able to follow the argument and spot who knows what they are talking about and who doesn't.


I chose to comment now because it is obvious that you will never change 
your oppinion and thus the thread was rapidly becomming bickering. With 
both sides flogging dead horses (You could be right in theory, everyone 
else is right in reality)

I'm trying to do you a favor.
Really.

BTW you cut your "last" post :
