It appears so...several people told me that as I was trying to sell
it.  I ended up trading it for a plat ruby veil, and 2 wis rings that
I forgot the name of, that add 7 each.  Much less than my original

for 100 hours like some people I would have definately held on to it,
and waited for the best possible deal.
