No the No Drop ones, it doesn't.  :-)

Too bad, it would sure be nice to recharge my Soulfire without
doing the quest all over again.

Personally, I think it would be great if there were a "recharger"
NPC in some not-too-convenient location who would recharge items
for an appropriate fee.

(This would only apply to items not marked "expendable".  That is,
items which don't poof when you use up all the charges.)

Charges on items are nice, but nearly useless in the long term.
You either use up the charges quickly and they're gone forever,
or horde them for a real emergency, which never seems to come.
Either way, what real good are they?
