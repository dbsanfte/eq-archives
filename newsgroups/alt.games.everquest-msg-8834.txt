Critical hits that happen while you are beserk (under 1/3 life left) are
automaticly upgraded to Crippling Blows.   They do roughly twice as much
damage than regular Critical hits.   They can happen at any time after you get
the ability to do normal criticals.

The first line of the critical hit is the base amount of the blow.   The
second line includes your level damage bonus that your primary hand gets.


And yes, the level damage bonus is level based (as the name implies) and will
continue to go up as you get higher in levels.   It is applied to all hits,
btw, not just criticals. (This is why a 9 damage 18 delay weapon is *much*
better than an 18 damage 36 delay weapon in your primary hand.  It will hit
much more often and get that 8 points of damage added to each hit.  However,
both weapons will be exactly equal damage output if placed in your secondary
hand.)

It's all based on level.  The strength bonus is added into the normal hit.
(first line of the critical).
