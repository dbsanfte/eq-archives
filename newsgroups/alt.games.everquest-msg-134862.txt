That's what I was talking about...

The only thing better about a CR in CT is that you don't
have to have a wizard port up to get you there.  As far as
mob difficulty and such, I'd much rather do a CR for a single
person in Hate (even fully popped) than the Maze in CT.

It could just be my opinion, but I know how the mobs
move and such in Hate, as well as exactly what will
bother me.  Getting to the 'port spot in CT without a group
of 6 rogues always seems to me to be a "oh, shit, invis
dropped...ever seen Jurassic Park, guys?" type of fight.
