I know that's the case now but was it the case way back when the guy did it?
When kunark came out?

I would have thought that under the current system of aggro that either the
bandits would kill him, or not aggro at all, even with the pet. Maybe it's
now possible to have someone twinked enough so that no aggroing mob in that
cave would ever kill him no matter how long he was afk, but in those days,
people wore bronze armour! I don't know what was hip in shaman fashionware
way back then but it certainly wasn't ornate chain ;-)

 I'm pretty sure people could tell the pet to attack all mobs, and then they
would find out that that meant ALL mobs, eg your own guards i.e. LOADING...
