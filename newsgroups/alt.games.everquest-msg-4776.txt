(snips 6k of total bollocks)

Well, this is a new one.....  I now think I'm in charge, do I?  And everyone
knows it, do they? .

Most people give their opinions, not you....  you hand down statements. You
spout edicts, and portray as a heretic, any who disagree. The Pope issues
Bulls and you issue bullshit. Stick to the game and you will be ok.

I really do not understand why you people feel so threatened. A few new
arrivals and you all form into a defensive huddle. Some of them believe they
are as Pizarro, come to conquer the New World and tear down the old order.
Some of you act like some bigoted group, frightened of the arrival of boat
people, and fearing they won't assimilate into your nice cosy world.

Just what is it you feel you are trying to protect?

You go on and on about killfiles and ignoring posts, and then do exactly the
opposite. You talk about idiots and morons and "short buses" and then go on
to engage in meaningful conversation with the very people you believe do not
have the intelligence to understand the point you are making. You write
enormous tracts about how they are not worth talking to, and act peeved when
they respond.

You are a dinosaur, biz..... look up in the sky, can you not see that bright
light falling?

I don't respond to 99.9% of these morons.....    bizbee
