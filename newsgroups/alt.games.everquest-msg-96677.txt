Since he's talking about "removing" something, and the raid channel
would be an "add", I'm guessing not. More likely referring to the
alleged removal of the hell levels, which personally I hope does not
happen. Much like the spell book that all the low level casters whinge
about, I consider them more of a "rite of passage" sort of thing. It's
been part of the character of the game for too long, and removing it
just makes EQ less of the challenge it has been and one step closer to
turning it into a playstation game because the players whine too much.
