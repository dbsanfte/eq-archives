The entry zone is Barren Coast and the level 56s would get chewed up.
There's a ton of undead that has a rather nasty assist and aggro range
and the normal animal mobs like to swarm you if you aren't amiable to
them.  The level 65s would probably find it a challenge but do-able if
you found a nice pull spot to pluck singles from.

Beyond here you're most likely looking at a full or near full group of
baz geared 65s for any form of safety.  Think maybe MPG to RSS
difficulty mobs.  Most things don't summon and it's outdoors so that
makes things a bit easier.  A bit.
