In "the old days", when LGuk was one of a very few
dungeons appropriate for high-level characters, I'd have
agreed with you.

But now there are so many places to go that it's not
unreasonable for groups to hunt larger chunks of
real estate in order to keep themselves busy.  It 
makes more sense than the old days of everyone 
being partitioned into a single room or hall, 
killing the spawns when they pop, then having
nothing to do for the next fifteen minutes except
wait for them to spawn again because other groups
were sitting in the surrounding rooms doing the
same thing.  Booooring.

Hell, my 55 Paladin can *solo* the Sav/Cav/Sage/Exe
camps and keep them cleared, and I've done so late at
night when no one else wanted them.  Or at least I can 
when I kill only the frogs I actually need to kill while zapping 
the "named" frogs -- there's no point in killing all 
the Exe's "honor guard" when he or his PH can be single-pulled.
