Or as Brian just pointed out: pry the fuckers off your keyboard.

My keyboard has been sans windows key for about 3 months now and the only
adverse affects I have notice is that it is easier for the sesame seeds to
fall from ones turkish bread into the keyboard through the resulting larger
gaps.

Still, being able to easily watch all the civilisations develop under the
keys from the primordial soup of spilt beer, food and dermatalogical
detritus sure as hell beats Gems in downtime. Right now on mine the
Visigoths from the tilde key basin seem to be advancing towards the left
control key plateau, but as always you should never forget to factor in the
endless tide of Huns always threatening to spill in from the number pad...
