All is not lost, however.  It seems you can multiquest the letter
to the king.

First, go to Mignah, and get a new slate, then go and camp next
to the registrar.  Then create a new kitty, give your note to 
your trainer, then take the new note to Bindarah, go get your
tax document - hand only it into Bindarah, camp.  Log in your
original kitty, and hand in your slate.

Voila, you should have a note to the king, so you can complete
the citizenship quest again and get a new cloak.

This is much easier with a buddy to create the disposable Vah shir,
as then you don't need to play around with logging in and out between
giving the items.
