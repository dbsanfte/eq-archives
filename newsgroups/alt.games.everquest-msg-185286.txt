This new server is going to be the worst server in the entire game. Every
uber guild who sees themselves as "second" or "third" on their server is
going to want to leave to it.

Instead of 2 or 3 or 4 guilds full of level 65 characters in the upper
planes, there will be 18.

Enjoy your new server, those of you who have 75 bucks to throw away in
getting yourself into an even bigger competition for the "big targets".
