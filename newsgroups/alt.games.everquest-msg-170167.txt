I stopped playing EQ about 4 months ago after getting my necro to 60. 
I have a friend who still plays and was going to come back play again
as a duo.  Since I soloed pretty much all the way to 60, I was looking
for some recommendations of duo's that work well together and
compliment each other's skills. Any advice?
