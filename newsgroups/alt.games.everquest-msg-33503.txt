It worked for "Avatar", an online multi-player dungeon game on
the old CDC "Plato" computer network (in the 1980's).

The idea was that time online would age the character (slowly).
Other things could age your character faster than the "normal"
rate, such as having a rez fail (there was always a chance
of that, it would "damage" the character somewhat, but then
you could just try another rez), or teleporting into rock
and having to be magically extracted, etc -- such things
would "take years off your life" due to the wear and tear.

As you approached and/or exceeded the "normal lifespan" for
your character's race, he would begin to have a chance to
just drop dead from "old age" without warning.

But he could still be rezzed normally.

The problem was that as he got older and older, the odds
of "natural death" kept increasing, so if he got too old
you'd barely be able to make it out of the city without
croaking again after each rez.

In practice it seldom got to that stage, because there
were magical potions that would make you one year younger
per dose consumed.  They were rare, but old (and thus
likely high-level and powerful) characters would pay lots of
money to the players who were lucky enough to loot them.

I liked the system, and it worked just fine.

There was another multi-player dungeon game (Moria) on the
same Plato computer network where when you died, you were
*DEAD* -- time to start over.  The risk, and adrenalin
rush of near-death encounters, was half the fun.
