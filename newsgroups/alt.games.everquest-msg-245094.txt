Not not all well equipped are gimps.  It's just that I have found out with some
I have grouped with, not just monks, any class, that if they are very well
equipped, and get their "twink buffs" (KEI, Virture, etc.) before heading out
for a crawl, sometimes that is a handicap.  One bad mob that dispells their
buffs, and suddenly they panic.  For some reason the cleric or chanter that is
in our group, that can give Temp or Clarity II, is not goot enough.  It's not
Hand of Virtue or KEI or higher.

Now, a good player, with good gear, then all the better.  And I praise them for
taking the time, however they did it, to get their good gear.  If they didn't
farm the items themselves, their main did.  Either way, they took time, nothing
wrong with that.  It's the people that can't do anything without being fully
raid buffed I was calling gimp.

And those are always the most fun groups IMO.  The non-standard groups, where
someone that is not normally the healer, playing the main healer, someone not
normally the slower, being the slower (some melee pulls out slow proc weap,
procs, pulls back out main weap, etc.), etc.  If nothing else it gives me faith
that people can adapt and play a slightly different role, and still be very
successful.  Too many times I've been in a group that didn't want to move
because one specific class was not available.  Now, I wouldn't crawl if all we
had to depend on were bandages.  :)
