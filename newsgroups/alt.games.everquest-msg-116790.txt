Actually, it's three hours *online*.  Offline time does not run out
the rez timer.  Many times I've camped for the night and successfully
gotten a rez when I logged back in the next day (in one case, about
24 hours later).

This can be verified even more easily now that you can /con a
corpse and read its rez timer.  You'll find that for the
corpses of people who are logged out, the rez timer on
their corpses is "frozen", and does not count down.  For
people who are online, you can /con their corpse repeatedly
and actually see the rez timer tick down.

There are a few catches, though:

1.  Sitting at the character select screen counts as "online" time.
Be sure to camp *all* the way out for the night.

2.  Running a different character on the same account *also*
counts as online time.  To preserve your rez timer, get entirely
out of the game.

3.  Some people have reported that their rez timers have
kept running if they /q out of the game.  This doesn't always
happen, though, it appears to be in intermittent bug.
But to be safe, if you're camping out to preserve your
rez timer, get out of the game the slow, old fashioned way
to ensure that the game knows you've logged out:
Sit, /camp, then hit the "Exit" button on the char select
screen, then again on the server select screen, etc. until
you step out of the game.
