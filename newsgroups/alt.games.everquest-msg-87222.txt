Sweet sword.  My guild leader just picked one of those up, while he's
working on his Nature Defender.  AMG, that looks awesome.  I lucked out and
got his shieldstorm when he made this his main sword (just a loan, really,
so I can build up my 2hs, he still needs it for raids).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
