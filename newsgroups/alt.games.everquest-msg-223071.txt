Right. So equality is neither a result nor a premise.  I believe all the 
people we're discussing here are rational (ie, having reason or 
understanding, and possibly competent to stand trial. :) ) as is 
demonstrated by the fact that they could read the Golden Rule, rationally 
apply it to their situation, and derive advice from it.  The issue isn't 
their rationality, so much as that they desire different treatment from 
the 'others' they are 'doing unto'.

All integers are rational.  Well.  That was an easy blanket statement to 
find an exception to. :)

}But its equally impossible to make a blanket statement that sex for 
}money is inherently good. (And of the two options the 'its bad' version 
}is less jarring, at least to me.)

I would find "sex for money is neither inherently good nor inherently bad" 
least jarring of all.  Consider that the 'its bad' version may be less 
jarring in part simply because you've heard it many, many more times than 
the contrary.

Almost all cases I'm aware of, of it being good -or- bad, and I've seen 
plenty of cases on either side, there is something outside of the question 
"was there sex for money?" that determines the goodness or badness.  Ie, 
did the sex for money occur to obtain money to feed an addiction?  Would 
the john have had a reasonable chance of getting a date in some other way?  
Would restructuring the sex-for-money interaction as a sex-for-dinner-and- 
a-movie interaction have produced any benefit or loss for either party?

Is selling hamburgers either good or bad?  Probably not.  Is it reasonable 
to expect the purchaser of said hamburger to consider whether or not too 
many hamburgers may eventually lead to atherosclerosis (the leading cause 
of death in the United States)?  Is it reasonable to expect the seller to 
consider whether the increase in cattle-raising their business may entail 
may lead to the destruction of farmable land?  There's good and bad on 
both sides of a simple McDonald's transaction.  Is the existence of the 
bad enough that we should outlaw hamburgers?  Or should we let people make 
their own informed decisions in this regard and deal with the 
consequences...
