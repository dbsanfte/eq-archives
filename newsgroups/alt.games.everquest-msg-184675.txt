Ignore it. Get inside the hut with the hermit before you attack.
Go to the back and stand by the chimney with your nose in the corner as
far as it will go. Treeform. Press forward, remove treeform. You are now
in the hut. 
Go to the opposite corner from the Hermit. He is non aggro to 99% of all
Druids. He has no faction hits for killing, thus he will not become
aggro either. (For ease of recovery, I bound a little ways off in some
trees).
Become a tree again. The regen will help, as will the slight AC
increase. Nothing that wanders nearby aggroes trees....

Buff up and med up. Then:
Target Hermit
TAB
Cast your damage shield
TAB
Root
Snare
DoT
DD,DD,DD,DD,DD,DD etc. until root breaks.
Melee/DD until out of mana or Hermit dies.

At 19 with only Wicker armor, my Druid was able to do this and have 2
full health and 1 full mana when it was over. Drop the rest of your mana
in heals, then med until repop. 2 minutes, I think.
Rinse and repeat until level 23 or so... ;-)
