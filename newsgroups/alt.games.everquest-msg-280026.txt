That would be those people who are clueless as to what the various buffs 
actually do for them.  For someone who is not going to be hit much, and 
is a melee class, SoT > SV > BBB.  They also like to have Champion or FA 
tossed in as well as the lowly Bih'Li.  For melee types, ATK is quite 
important, to a point.  If their attack is already so high that they are 
at the point of diminishing returns, then it might be reasonable to take 
more hp instead.
