Or, if his wife is a druid - druid snares, tosses in a flame-lick or two,
and runs in a controlled circle.  Backstabbing rogue follows behind the mob
playing poke-in-the-butt.  Evade once in a while to keep from pulling aggro
from the druid.  Good old-fashioned aggrokiting.  Mana expenditure is, lemme
see, 40 or so for Ensnare and 10 or so for each flame lick, call it 60 mana
per mob kill.  If necessary, this could double if more flame licks are
required...

Um.. you do have an Evade hotkey, right?  Or did you stop using that at
level 15, like the warrior who never trained Taunt?
