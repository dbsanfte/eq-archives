OK, so at 39 grouped with 57 I was getting 39/96ths
and she was gettting 57/96ths of the mob*ZEM*105%

Mob was blue to both of us so we should have been
dividing the exp by the same factor, and then that exp
was applied to our total, and displayed as a fraction
of that needed to reach the next level.  Since I was getting
about 40% of the exp off the kills, this looked like about
half a blue per, while her 60% of the same kill applied
to her 57 to 58 leveling bar didn't even move a pixel.

By the old system, where these things were based on
relative exp rather than relative level, we would both have
experienced about the same bubble per hour rate.  Now,
though, while its great for leveling me up faster, it sucks for
her, I'm clearly not doing 40% of the labor but I'm sucking
up 40% of the exp.

What on earth motivated them to change a nicely tuned
system which encouraged people of a wide range of levels
to work together to mutual benefit into this monstrousity?

This would be consistent with the system as described, divvy
up the exp and -then- apply modifiers to it based on
each person's level versus that of the mob... green to you?
Your modifier is times zero.

This would mean 4) based on split C) or roughly 40%
what he would get soloing the mob.  Of course if the
high level is killing the mobs anyway at least 40% of the
exp isn't going to waste.

Hmm, getting in more low levels would then mean that
even less of the exp would be wasted.  With 5 level 40s,
a level 60 killing greens would see (60/260 23 % of the
exp) which would be discarded, and the other 5 would each
see (40/260 15% of the exp)... and that would really be
applied to 120% of the mob*ZEM exp, due to the GEM,
so it would be 18% of what they would get soloing the
mob... but if thats say 5 bards singing to a wizard, then you'd
be looking at a lot of mobs per hour compared to what the
bards could take down soloing.
