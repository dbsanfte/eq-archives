I had the same problem (Vice City installed DX 9). However, after 
Googling around I used ALT ENTER to switch to fullscreen and Gamma 
started working again.

During the search I also found out what the far clip slider does, moved 
it from 0 to 100 . First thing I noticed was I could see across the 
Nexus, I then went to Hollowshade, absolutely amazing when standing high 
up.
