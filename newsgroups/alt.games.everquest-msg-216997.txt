I like it as a puller.  Of course I'm only a ghetto L55, so my MR
doesn't go over 100% without a buff unless I trash my ac/hp.

As for Enchanters, unless the mission is a slam dunk (I've been grouped
with some overpowered characters who made missions near trivial) I'd
much rather have an Enchanter than not.  If you're rushing to try to
finish when time looks tight it's much easier to go for 2 to 3 mobs
per pull, which is gonna suck for a group that isn't totally dominating
the mobs unless you have an Enchanter or Bard in group, and Enchanter
mez doesn't push the mobs around.

just my $.02
