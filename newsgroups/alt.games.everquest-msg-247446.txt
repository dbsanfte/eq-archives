Does anyone know how this thing works?  What is it that you get back?  I
have a fledgling ranger that was being used to help out someone in AC, and
got ambushed.  We hardly ever play some the 7 day issue is not a factor.  I
just need to know if I should drag his body back out, or just wait for it to
show up in Shadowrest.  Sorry to say, I am more worried about the equipment
he has on the the char.  I have more fun it seems on my new toons, but have
started to get into  taking them to the higher lvl.  Thanks for your time.
