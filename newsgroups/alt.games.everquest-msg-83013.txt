Not bye bye character, bye bye corpse (and whatever was on it).  Your
character is indestructible and will always remain (barring a bug)
unless YOU decide to delete him.  It's entirely possible to keep on
playing even if your corpse has poofed.  You just go to the bank and
get out any money, equipment, etc. you have stored there and keep
going as best you can.  Of course, it's most likely that all your
_best_ stuff was on the corpse, but recovery is possible and has been
done by many of us.
