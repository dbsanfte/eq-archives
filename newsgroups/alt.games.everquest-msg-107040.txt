Right, there's no problem at all seeing the keyboard, it's like
wearing a pair of sunglasses (with a clear lens).  The software alters
the view on the screen so that when you view it with the glasses it's
real 3d.  I got the wireless because i don't need any extra cords
coming out of my PC, but I asked about the wire and they told me it
was very thin and about 8 ft.  i doubt it would be a problem, but i
just wanted the convenience of no wires.
