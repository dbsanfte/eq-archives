The problem is, of course, warriors never come into their own.  The will
always need someone else around to group with.

I do notice that warriors tend to be the chattiest chars out there.  Necros
are the most closed-mouth.  Shaman tend to have the best sense of humour.
Druids are the greediest (blatant attempt to slam the druid population
noted.  No, I really like druids.  I do.  I love their ports and am always
friends with them.  I swear.).  What other trends do we notice?
