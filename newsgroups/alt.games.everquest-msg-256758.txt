From what I have read, attack buffs, +attack effects, strength, and
most anything that increase your attack rating other than weapon
skills and related effects will do nothing to increase your chance to
hit.  I don't claim to know for sure but that's what some BL claimed
after parsing for many hours.

Perhaps you are hitting just as often with attack buffs on, but they
are non-zero hits, or some other deceptive result.  I don't know.  If
I find the article, I will link it.
