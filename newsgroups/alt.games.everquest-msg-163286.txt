-- The Paladin "snare undead" spell.  Oh, wait.....

-- Honestly, the fixing of the hybrid XP penalty.

-- The presence of unique paladin buffs (brells)

--Druid and Shammy CH because it leaves Pallys as as distant third healers.

-- Reliance on Proc buffs to balance paladins.  They're just waaaay to
unreliable to be useful.  I've had IoN go off six times in one fight, and
then gone a half-hour of solid melee without one proc.

-- Whatever they're doing to slowly lower my hit rate.  And average of one
in seven hits tonight.
