TO say Windows XP/2k/98/95 compatable Microsoft requires a set of
standards. You can say Windows required, but this is different from
fair use.

MS has always had a set of standards that it requires you to follow in
order to certify as Windows compatable. Most developers follow them
for the most part regardless of certification level.
