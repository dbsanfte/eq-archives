That's good to know, although I'll assume that in cases where the mob is
slowed early in the fight, the importance of the stuns is greatly reduced.
They would still come in handy against casters in LDoN, and, given what I
see as a less than overwhelming DPS difference, I would love to use WoX over
Servant of Marr for its tanking abilities and the aggro generated by its
stuns.  The problem is that whenever I use WoX, a couple of fights later
people are complaining about the push.  One of the regulars wants us to get
flagged for HoH, so maybe my little WoX will finally have his day in the
sun.
