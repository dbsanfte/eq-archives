Amen. Uninformed voters hitting random levers are doing FAR more harm to
the system than people too uninformed or apathetic to take the time to
form an opinion and go vote who wind up staying home. I leave some
levers unpulled on election day from time to time, and it's usually
ballots on various bonds that are requested, etc. where I had no
interest in the subject, or no opinion either way. Also on some local
and state level elections where I honestly knew nothing about the
candidate and didn't involve myself in the race. (I couldn't tell you
who our County Executive is, for example, and did not vote for or
against him/her in the last election.)
