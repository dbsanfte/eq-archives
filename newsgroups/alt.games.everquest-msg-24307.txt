In Sony/Verant's eyes, that $9.89/month is their redeeming quality.

Well, snooped 'em huh? I'll cross respect for others privacy off your

Not everyone can devote 24/7 to a game. You shouldn't be so critical of
people that only find 8-10 hours a day to play. I am lucky to get in 3 hours
a day which makes me an absolute pariah, I'm getting tired of it!

Average person in the USA watches 6 hours of TV per day. Most people just
replace TV with EQ.
> Are all you people that pathetic?

Compared to say... yourself? Pathetic is such a relative term. I mean
compared to someone who spends all their time and money running a free
health clinic I'm pretty pathetic. Compared to your average dope fiend or
pimp I am pillar of society. I think most people fall somewhere in the
middle. Let me check... yeap, compared to you I don't feel pathetic at all.
On some levels, like not having to hide behind an anonymous email address to
do my trolling, I feel downright superior.

I have Three kids, 2 of which are married. That productive enough or would
that be reproductive vs productive.

When was the last time you got laid? Is getting laid more productive in your
hierarchy? I mean if you could spend 8 hours a day getting laid, would you
think you were be more productive then say a TV viewer or EQ player? If that
is your standard then there are a lot of people in the "pathetic" catagory
above i.e. pimps and dope fiends, that are much more productive then either
you or I.

Acutely aware.

I've read where people have ended up making friends or getting married after
meeting in game: It's called "spin". Sells newspapers, magazines, nothing
more. One week a magazine will have an article on how someone's marriage
broke up, sells a 100k copies. Next month they will have an article on how
many people are finding true love online, sells 100k copies. Don't take
anything you read seriously.

See? Here we are subjective again. If I spent 8 hours a day smelling roses,
drinking beer, kissing girlfriends, I would end up with hay fever, beer
belly, and chapped lips. Most people I know would consider it a pretty
pathetic life.
"Hey, whats your father doing?"
"He is in the park, smelling flowers, kissing women, and drinking beer."
"Oh, I'm sorry. Any chance of having him get professional help before he is
arrested?"

Hey! You to! You kind of made mine.
