Im curious if there are ruled creating a guild. I want to create a guild of gay
teens and have it like........i dunno maybe i can think of a good name for now,
but i was wonderin is this against the rules since im not including strait
people? Or can i chose whoever i want in my guild? I really wouldnt have a
problem with having the guild have both strait and gay people, but guilds are
supposed to have something in common, u know? so.......anywayz, is there a rule
list anywhere of what guilds can and cannot do or wahtever?
