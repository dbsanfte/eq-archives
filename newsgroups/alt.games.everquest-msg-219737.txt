All the time.  I dreamt the other night that I was medding in BB waiting for my
group to head to LDoN and all of a sudden they ported me into some raid zone. 
I'd never been to a raid and didn't recognize the area I was in, (which is
really odd if you think about it).  And all the raid people were yelling at me
to get out because I wasn't part of the raid.  I kept trying to explain that I
didn't *want* to be there and kept trying to gate out but I was bound there!!! 
It was a nightmare.....
