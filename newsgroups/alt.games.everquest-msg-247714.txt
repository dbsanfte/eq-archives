The people who told you that were wrong.  The rules specify engagement - 
first person/group to get aggro.  If you /assist the mob after rooting it, 
you will see that the mob knows you engaged it. :)

Mobs not showing damage, like the HGs some druid snared in Rathe 
mountains, make it a lot harder for others to tell you've engaged it.  So 
mistakes will happen, and people will accidentally KS you and then try to 
rationalize their action.  They're wrong, according to the rules, but it's 
an easy mistake to make, so a certain amount of forgiveness may be in 
order before completely going off on them.  Explain they can tell you've 
engaged it by /assisting the mob.  If after that, they keep doing it, 
they're probably lying sacks of shit and can be dealt with accordingly.  
But mostly, people say 'oh, oops, sorry' and move on. :)
