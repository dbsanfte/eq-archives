Three necromancers held in attack Camping, hate crime alleged in
assault on female town merchants; Racial motive suspected. Incident is
fourth in area committed by adventuring group

 Three dark elf necromancers have been charged with armed robbery and
a hate crime in an attack that left a elvish Felwithe waitress in need
of greater healing while raising concerns about the safety of the
city's zone, a guard said yesterday.

 Takarra Treehater, level 27, of the third gate of Neriak was charged
with offending guards, scowling, faction hits, felony camping and
possession of a undead pet with intent to abjure after a merchant was
attacked and hit in the face with a DD.

 Treehater also was charged with violating a law against racial and
religious faction, a guard said.

 A girl and boy, both level 24 and from Neriak, were hit with faction
losses in the incident. A guard did not release their names yesterday
because of their level.

 Treehater was being held without bail at the bind point in
Butcherblock, authorities said. The boy was being held in a bind point
in Steamfont. The girl was being zoned into Lesser Faydark.

 Felwithe guard spokesman Guard Stormwalker said other necros also
were involved in the attack and that city guard expect to make "one or
two" more attacks soon.

City  Guards said Treehater led the attack on Shop of all Holds
waitress Teena VonDoogle, who was walking to her car near Duke of
Felwithe about 11:00 p.m. when she was rooted and dotted. A guard said
a man struck VonDoogle with a DD, stunning her, then sent the pet in
while a boy ran up and repeatedly taunted her.

 The assailants then looted VonDoogle's backpack, which contained her
coin, several spiderling silks and a +4 int pair of earrings, and
zoned, a guard said.

 VonDoogle suffered a loss of HP, which required a rez, and needed to
med  to recover her stamina and mana, guard said.

A city guard said that after VonDoogle turned when down to 1 bub of
HP, the necromancers continued to attack her.

 VonDoogle is elvish; the suspects are dark elves.

 "It appears to be racially motivated," said Crane. "Looting was the
not the main motive. They had specific targets in mind." In a similar
incident two days before the waitress was attacked, a elvish mage was
assaulted by eight to 10 dark elf necromancers near The Bank of
Felwithe , city guards said.

 That assault remains under investigation. Guards will train soon..

 The assault on VonDoogle, the latest of four attacks by a group in
Felwithe from mid-June to late July, raised concern among zone
merchants and NPCs about safety near the zone line.

  City guards said they increased patrols of the zone area in the wake
of the attacks and emphasized that the roving group of necros "is not
an organized guild." "In EQ, there are always concerns for people's
safety, whether it's retail or people leaving their place of
employment at 2 or 3 in the morning," said Stooner Samarian, past
president of the Felwithe Business Association. He said the recent
string of attacks was unusual for the area and added, "Hopefully, they
got the right PCs."

 This is not a new revelation. dark elves are the foremost
perpetrators of "hate crimes". 30,000 elvish women are raped by dark
elf males every year. Over 5,000 elves are assaulted just as occurred
in the above crime every year, usually with more severe HP loss. 1,800
elves are murdered by dark elvles every year.
