  Yeah... I have been keeping my eyes open for a "broker" since I started
playing in Firiona Vie... since you are limited about where you can /auction
and VERY few items are NO DROP.  Just about anything can be bought and sold,
IF you can actually find a buyer... which is not as easy on other servers
where you can buy and sell virtually anything as you run through EC. :P

  Of course, as of yet, my level 13 shadow knight hasn't really found
anything worth selling to other players, and hasn't really had the money to
buy anything of much value from others, either.
