Hehe, as a 33 druid, i do often also get asked to PL for free. I dont do
it either, i can kill giants in FM and get XP in that time, or kill
spiders in Guk for my tailoring skill instead.
Highest offer i have gotten was 9K from level 6-20. Turned it down, dont
wanna spend days playing PL slave for someone.
Sometime it seems like newbies dont know how long PLing takes, and just
think its something you get for free.
Sure, sometime i PL, if it fit into my plans (PL a level 15 warrior in
guk spider cave get me silk just as fast as i could get it myself. Then
i dont mind PLing. Or recently i have done the foraging parts of my
epic, dont mind playing buff/heal/DS station for the newbies in the area
when i can be there for hours, and dont need my mana anyway)
