Thanks, EqC.  I left off the Darkwood out of my list ( in a reply to Tiru )
because these guys are not ones to camp something when the camp doesn't
yield Exp - as opposed to myself, who spent ungodly hours in Qeynos Hills
chasing Pyzjn around.  I did read all the threads on the CDS shield and I
think I will obtain one for Draglorvin and Duesservus in my own time.  That
will give me something to do while I am waiting for my buds to log on.

Thanks again!
