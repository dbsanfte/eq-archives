  Now I feel really stupid -- that's exactly it.  My teenager made
this char and took him to level 3 before giving up the game (thats
when I got addicted, but I started with a Mage).  He made him a Rallos
Zek guy.  That didn't occur to me because I make all my characters
agostic to avoid things like this.  I just recently took over the old
warrior just to see what life is like on the melee side of the fence,
moving him from 3 to 13.

  Obviously, me getting past the guards and the guy at the dock was
pure dumb luck, until it caught up with me.
  
  Thanks.  I knew there was a reason I posted here :)
