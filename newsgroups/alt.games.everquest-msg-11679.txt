For WIS at or below 200, mana from WIS is (WIS/5+2)*Level.  Above 200,
the formula changes so the effect of more WIS is indeed very small, but
I don't know the formula.

However, this does not mean getting WIS over 200 is not important.
Suppose you got to exactly 200, then stopped getting WIS items.  Then
you went to fight, say, Nagefen, and needed to put on a lot of fire
resistence and magic resistence gear.  You will probably end up losing
some WIS.  E.g., my Wizard has 197 INT, but when I put on my Nagafen
gear, which is just barely enough to get my resistences acceptable for
Nagefen or similar dragons, I lose something like 30 INT.
