1)They will have 2 of their characters in a LDON group.  All zone
inside dungeon.  Within 5 min of fighting, one of their characters
goes LD.  Then they inisist on pushing forward.  Then just moments
before the adventure is over , the LDed character is logged back in to
help out with the final Boss if there is one.  Otherwise, they don't
bring the LDed character back in. The LD character receives any points
if available!

2)Another trick is to never have ANY intention at all of playing in
LDON, but they still want the points (full/partial).  What they will
do is realize that they have a GUILD raid comming up in 30 min.  So
they will run to LDON camps and get a group.  Then once inside the
dungeon they will say, 'Sorry guys but I have a guild raid to attend'.
 They zone out, but never leave the adventure.  So should the
remaining 5 member party recveive full or partial points, they receive
them also!  Its point leaching!

I have decided to start adding point leachers to my ignore list.  Fool
me once, shame on you ... fool me twice, shame on me!

Players be aware that this is an increasing trend amoung guilded
players.  They are trying to burn the candle at both ends at your
expense!

I personally try to build and join groups were there are a few guilded
players as possible!

*Rant off*
