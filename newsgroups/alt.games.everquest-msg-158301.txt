So what gives? Do Druids stop being usefull in groups in their
> mid-late levels?


Yup. Personally, i never group a druid since I can get a shaman and they do
everything better. Plus, no one really likes druids, simply because they are
whine boys that piss and moan. And usually dont know how to play their toons
in a group. Since I play a dark elf I also tell my wife not to rez pouty
druids that have died taking 4 of our mobs from a camp we were hunting at as
well. Its really quite funny.

ALso you are f***ing worthless past level 49 by the way. Even with your cry
baby complete heal.
