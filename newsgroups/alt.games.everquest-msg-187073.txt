Weeeell, they did push it a little far on this expansion.  Take, for
example, the Shaman spell that cured both disease and poison counters
(Disinfecting Aura, I believe).  When "Pure Blood" was added, Disinfecting
aura was changed to only cure...ack, one or the other...but not both.  
So, in effect, Sony took something away, and if a class wanted to have the
same ability they previously had (or in this case, a watered-down version
of what they used to have), they were forced to buy the expansion.

Now try to tell me that ain't stinky.
