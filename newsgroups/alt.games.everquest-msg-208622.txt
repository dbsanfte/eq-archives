Done Saryn and the zone has been fine however we've also had the zone
crash mid Saryn fight, this has also happened to us with Agnarr
recently except Agnarr was dead and the loot had been distributed
when the zone decided to go down losing the lot (flags too).

Not a whole lot you can do about it other than grit your teeth and
hope it doesn't happen next time. :(
