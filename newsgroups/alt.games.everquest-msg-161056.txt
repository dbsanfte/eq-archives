Actually, there's alot of fun you could have if you use faction as an actual
stat.  I always thought that the strength of a Paladin's spells should be
keyed off the faction they have with the appropriate cleric's guild.  If you
want to use BMB, you need to be at least indifferent to his temple in
Kaladim.  Anything less, and it won't work, KOS, and it backfires on you.
As you go higher in faction, the spell becomes more powerful.  Alas, that
would require more roleplaying.
