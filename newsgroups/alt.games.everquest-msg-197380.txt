Hmmm...bitter about something?

Games ARE work, for a particular reward.  Hell, PLAY is work, in most
cases - if it weren't work, we would not consider worthy of
consideration, because very little satisfaction comes from things that
are easy.  Work can be fun too...but work is predicated on the
appropriate "payment" at the succesful completion of said work.


Access to high-level planes was not a reward - it was (and is, at this
date) recompense.

You are either: a.) on a very populus server where large numbers of
people have managed to make it through killing Manaetic Behemoth, b.) 
talking out of your @$$, or c.) both.

I can only speak regarding my experiences on my server, The Nameless: 
while some trash talk and VERY sporadic trains/bs happen in Tactics,
the majority of the people there are considerate of each other, and
the zone is not overrun with people at all - usually no more than 40,
which appears to be only slightly less than the zone can handle for
experience.  These people have killed "an unkillable monster" (per the
storyline), and have been paid, in essence, for that by being invited
to meet Rallos Zek.  In addition, they are being paid with the best
experience in the game outside of the elementals and Time.  I can
predict what will happen with this zone on the Nameless, because it
has already happened in PoN, PoV, and is beginning to happen in BoT: 
trains, ks'ing, bickering, trash-talk, and general bad times for those
who come to this game to work and have fun doing it.

Flags are a great idea that was not implemented correctly, thus
destroying badly put-together guilds (aka, guilds with an
"every-man-for-himself" point of view) and RL friendships of people
who could not see the fact that, in your words, "this is a game".  PoV
and PoS, I can see opening - but the opening the other zones merely
marginalizes the accomplishments of those who've been able to continue
the larger PoP quest.
