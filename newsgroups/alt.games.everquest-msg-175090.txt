when you con a monster, what you're really getting is a straight
numeric comparison of the mob's level vs your level.  it does NOT
take into account how *strong* you or the mob actually are.

some mobs are quite overpowered for the level the designers decided
to assign to them.

and they were caster mobs to boot, which are more difficult for a
melee to kill.
