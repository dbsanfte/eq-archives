Yes,

Or plays loud music in the middle of the night, or stands around naked
waving body part at passing motorists.  There are obligations to society
that need to be followed, or you have anarchy.  Want to know what that's
like, I can get you a ticket to Baghdad (I saw what it was like in Sarajevo,
I assume it's not as bad in Iraq, right now, but close).

I know, your response is along the lines of "How do you equate cyboring with
anarchy?  That's a real stretch."  It is, but it is a slippery slope when
you start to allow a few to "get away" with violating social mores because
it suits them.

Maybe something that is more appropriate to you... Loud music at a party
next door, middle of the night, with lot's of drunken swearing.  I assume
it's ok with you.  You would not report it because you were eavesdropping on
the language and the music (even though it was in your face).  Never mind
that it's againt the law to violate noise and obsenity ordnances, those are
just others imposing their morals on the people attending the party
(therefore, based on your argument, they shouldn't care what others
see/hear).  Would you be a hypocrite if you called the police?
