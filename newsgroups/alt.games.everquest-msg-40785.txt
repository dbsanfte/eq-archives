Ok I know what my station username/password is but when I click connect it
will just say something like "The username you've entered has not been
registered,   please click on the new accounts button"  If I try to start a
new account it says  the cd-key is already in use. I've tried e-mailing
Verant (no response) and calling (just got busy signal) with no luck.

Can anyone help? Thanks
