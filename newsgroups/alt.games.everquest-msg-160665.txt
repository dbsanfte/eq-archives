All giants in KD have a chance of dropping armor.  I've seen drops off the mobs
at the WL line.  The chance of a drop seems to be proportional to the level of
the mob... at any rate its very low on a per mob basis even on the highest level
mobs.

What I'd strongly advise you do if what you want is maximal chance of getting
some plate for yourself would be to get partners who are of non plate wearing
classes.  That leaves leather, silk, and chain.  Say monk, necro, shaman, for
example.  You'll kill at least 4 times as many mobs per hour, and yet won't have
to compete for the plate drops at all.  If that was as far as it went, well, you
could certainly keep all loots and try and trade for plate... but plate is used
by more classes and thus is more desirable/harder to find available.  Further,
its silly to suggest that your group will be killing at a rate only 4 times what
a solo 50 cleric can... its probably going to go thru 20 times what you can
solo, or to go thru higher level mobs that have more frequent drops and are more
rewarding in terms of experience.
