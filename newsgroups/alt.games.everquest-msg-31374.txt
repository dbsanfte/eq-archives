As a half elven ranger I'd say Wood elf may be the right class "stats" wise
for the high wisdom and agility - just shove your points in stamina and
you're away.

However, half elves look nifty and not like prepubescent vogue models. ;-)

It depends on the maturity of your server as well - for a long long time
the HP difference just isnt that large and warriors are going to be wearing
the same or similar armour as rangers. Banded -> crafted is pretty damn
similar to Banded -> Ivy , so unless your server is at the stage things like
the enamelled black BP are going very cheap the difference may not be as
large as you think.

A *well played* ranger is probably a 4 out of 5 - the ability to aggro manage,
tank a while, put out decent damage, pull, track , snare and do out of combat
touch up heals is all very useful, but much like the druid there are a variety
of useful abilitys in one package that aren't the absolute optimal at any
point; so really, if the person behind the keyboard has the nouse to use them
correctly a ranger can be a super-valuable addition to the group.

WRT to the rest of the post I feel you may have underestimated both necro
and enchanter group ratings, and made no mention of shaman slows ;)
