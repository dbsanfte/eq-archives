About a month ago someone on the FV server (where most items
which are normally No Drop aren't) discovered that one of the
quest items you get by speaking a trigger phrase to an NPC
sells to vendors for a moderate amount of cash.  And since
the NPC which gives the item was itself a vendor, he set
up a program which repeatedly spoke the trigger phrase to
get the item, then sold the item back to the vendor, and
repeated indefinitely...

He was caught, but only warned from what I've heard.
