Just think of it this way.  If you want to go to Katta at a very low
level, there isn't much better character now than a level 9 bard.

Equip that drum, and take off.  If you die, you respawn with all your
gear.  Make an adventure of it.  In the far past, my first character
was a bard.  Before he was level 10 I'd seen parts of almost every 
zone on Antonica.  Great fun.  (just to show how long ago that was,
I was making big PP by running down to Innothule, buying netted
gloves, then selling them to 10-15th monks who wanted to hunt wisps.
Oasis was almost deserted when I crossed it :-)
