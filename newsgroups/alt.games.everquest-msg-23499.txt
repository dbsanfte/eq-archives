I have now petitioned about and i was picked up by god and put on the
island where the icebrekar is :)

No problem at lvl 18, i have been there at lvl 16 and at lvl 4, not
hunting only going to the town to look for words for my necro research
and some nice weapons, and the TGD portal key :)
And besides i do anything to get away from the begging going on almost
everywhere now days :))

Right now i can't get back in at all, was kicked out while standing
invis in the eastern wastes zone *sigh*

/Regards Berth (Thotamon (hopefully still alive) lvl 18 DE necro
luclin)
