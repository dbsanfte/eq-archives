Since I work swing shifts, 6pm-2am, I am finding these current rash of 
patches to be very annoying. In fact, I have been keeping a little tally of 
EQ "down-time" since mid-February. It might interest you folks to know that 
since I started keeping track (February 19th) EQ has been down 78 hours 
(approx.), but NO month has been as bad as this month, May. In May EQ has 
been down nearly 40 hours, 34 hours to be exact. They have had 2 6 hour 
patches run into 10 hours and 8 hours respectively, plus the array of minor 
3-4 hour patches. I contacted SOE and the reply I got back simply said, 
"Your data is in error." That's it, well, it did have who to contact if a 
need further assistance.

Go figure!
