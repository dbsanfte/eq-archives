Holy crap!  You're Notwen!  I had NO idea...

Another point, "Blackballing" is generally considered rude form by
most of the other RP guilds, and probably won't make them too many
friends.  And if they can't RP with the other RP'ing guilds, well..
they're not gonna be RP'ing that much.
Blackballing is something you only do when it becomes obvious that the
rest of the community simply cannot deal with the *controller* of a
player, and it usually takes a pretty bad offense to do so, and a
number of them.  Simply putting someone on the shitlist for a name you
don't agree with is both petty and childish.  There are lots of people
in the RP community with names, that, while not being d00dish, are
certinanly on the "imaginative" side.

not to mention, having /shout turned off is just plain stupid.  How
many TRAIN TO ZONE messages and other helpful information are you
mssing out on?  And are they gonna turn /auction off, too?  Come to
think of it, what's the point of this being a social game, if you've
cut off the major areas of your communication?

It's silly, if you don't want it to be there, just ignore it.

Not to mention, power levelling is sometimes something you *need* to
do in order to get your frinds up to the level at which they can hunt
with you.

And yes, hunting is gonna be a big part of the RP.  The best events
are the stuff that happen off the cuff, and that usually happens
sometime when your'e out running around looking for stuff to kill.

There's plenty of RP in EQ, if you bother to look for it.  And the
Fennin RP community is a great one to be involved it.  It just takes
time to find it, is all. I was level 20 before I even realized that
there were epic storylines and such going on in the gameworld.

And yeah, it does seem like this guy is a disgruntled former member of
a RP guild.  

D2, you're simply being too strict, and unrealistic in your
implimentation.  This is classic RP "Nazi" behaviour.
