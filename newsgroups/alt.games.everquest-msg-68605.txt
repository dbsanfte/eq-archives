but how long did the  remaining 3 take to get?
this was my experience as well...got the first two very easily...went and got some
experience, and when I started working on the quest  again, the remaining three
took a week, 4-5 hours a night, minimum, every single day.

fortunately, I succeeded the final combine, so I didn't have to start over...
