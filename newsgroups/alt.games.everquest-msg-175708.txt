Almost everything on this newsgroup is a matter of opinion.  I just
assume everyone understands that a statement like "SWG isn't going to
be as cool as everyone thinks." is a matter of opinion.  I obviously
can't speak for everyone factually.

Actually no.  Most of the core design team for EQ is gone.  What's
left are people who know how to program but not necessarily design a
game.  Big difference.  The original talent is all but gone, that's
not to say there isn't any talent left at SOE merely that the talent
you are alluding to is no longer present.

I never said it sucked, you even quoted me so you should have seen it
too.  And I think it's flawed to say  no one knows anything about it
except what's posted.  Haven't you ever seen a movie that wasn't yet
in theaters?  Haven't you ever received a draft copy of a book not yet
in print?

So, for the sake of the newsgroup community, let me re-state:

It's my opinion that SWG will not be as cool as everyone thinks, and
for all the reasons already covered in this exhaustive thread.
