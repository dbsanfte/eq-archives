I have never seen an actual GM event in the (just over) one year I've
played. I wasn't able to play during the big halloween event, so can't
really count that.

I have heard of two GM events happening on one of the two servers I play on,
both were on other side of the world from where I was. Of course I had just
run from there!

I play on Ayonae Ro now, used to play on Rodcet Nife; still do if I want to
get away from the guild for a while (shh don't tell em).
