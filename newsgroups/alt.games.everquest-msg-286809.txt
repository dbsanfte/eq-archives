No, it's not "good" exp ever.  The mobs have too much hp for their level. 
It's a simple equation that decides whether exp is "good".  One large
variable in the equation is how fast the mobs die.  In BoT, the answer is
not fast enough.

It is "easy" to get to and "easy" to find a spot to camp, though.  Those
aren't variables in my grind, but I can understand how they might be for
others.  That doesn't make it good exp, just easy.
