This is kind of exciting.  How did they keep something this big a complete
secret?  Did anyone know anything about this?

I can't get the ordering information to come up.  I was wondering how much
they are charging for it.  Also wondering how they are handling the
different release dates?  You sign up and then use your code to download
each piece as it becomes available, or you can pre-order now, but none of it
will actually be available until all the parts are available?  Also,
wondering where they are going to start the Frogloks?
