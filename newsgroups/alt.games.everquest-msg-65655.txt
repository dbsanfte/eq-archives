You are better off with the new PCI card. The i810 graphics are built
into the motherboard. The i810 has 4 megs of video built into it. If
it needs more memory it steals it from the main system memory. On top
of that the i810 is marginal at best when it comes to 3D games and
applications.

You did the right thing by upgrading.

Cheers
