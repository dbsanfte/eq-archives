I wish there was a better way for alt characters to exchange items.
My suggestion would be to open the bank in the character selection screen
(where you select which character you are going to play).
On that screen, one character could get something out of his bank vault and
give it to an alt character that is already standing around on the same
screen.
They should be able to exchange anything they have, items or coin.

There, I have said it..    Let the flames descend.
