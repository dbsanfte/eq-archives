There is a major flaw in how you have come to your conclusion: you only
tested the difference AC makes for the first four of the sixty levels in EQ.
No doubt there is combat code that reduces the effects of extreme twinkage
at low levels.  You have merely determined that for levels 1-4, AC is not
terribly important.  What about the other 56?  The only way you can make
such a broad conclusion is by obtaining a broad range of experimental data,
which you have not done.  I am not saying that I can scientifically tell you
that AC becomes more important as you level, but the evidence presented here
certainly does not convince me otherwise.
