Hi ya's Bill!

Sorry I have to reach back remembering here (haven't been 12th on a druid in
a while.)  I believe you can hunt two places out of Gfay.  Crush bone, true,
on higher level crits that are mixed in you will probably need group help.
Think Lego's are red or yellow to you at this time and you might *barely*
win against one solo on a white con.

I would recommend Steamfont.  Over behind the windmills there should be
several monsters your size.  Lesser Drakes, Harpies, and Earth Elementals.
Around your level you should have a spell that is very much like a
necro/clerics ward undead.  This spell however works on summoned monsters
(elementals) and hits hard.

Remember with Lesser drakes they use fire based damage spells in battle.  I
hope that helps a bit more :)
