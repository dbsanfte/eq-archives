The thing is, that while by Verant's PnP policy, he was within the rules to
take the mob, that does not make it the acceptable way to do it in the game.
Players have evolved some generally accepted customs regarding camping, and
you broke those customs.  Admittedly, the guy was being a jerk about it.
The thing about the 3 camp thing in L Guk is different, that is not a
generally accepted custom of the game, taking one camp is accepted by the
player base, taking multiple camps is not generally accepted.  Just my 2 cp
worth.
