 >Wonder if they have any ideas how to correct this mess or not.

Without hurting people who really didn't know what was going
on, too. Take me, for example. I don't have anything high-
priced on my trader but if I *did* and someone came and
bought one or two or all of them with duped plat, what is
the correction going to entail? Will they/Would they/Do they
delete the plat that, I, an innocent bystander in the whole
thing, received for items I offered for sale legitimately?
