There is no restriction.

However, if a mob cons grey to anyone in the group - it cons grey for
everyone (meaning no xp or loot). Hence the lower level guys
won't get xp for attacking that mob, even though they could
get xp attacking that same mob if ungrouped.

As far as yell goes - there is an option to allow anyone to
break the encounter (i.e. 'yell'), or only the group leader.
