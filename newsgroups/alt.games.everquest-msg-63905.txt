The 'protocol' (in this case NEtBEUI) is, simply put, what language the 
machines are talking to each other in. You have myriad options for this 
because you may be on a network with bizarre servers speaking strange 
languages - they may not necessarily be Windows boxes you are trying to 
connect to for example.

You don't need to use NetBEUI as the protocol for your machines to talk to 
each other, you can use all sorts of things. However you *do* need to have 
TCP/IP available so your machines can talk to internet servers (i.e. your 
cable company's gateway etc). Since Microsoft File and Print Sharing will 
work quite happily with TCP/IP instead of NetBEUI, I simply use TCP/IP for 
this too. Note that this is secure on my LAN because I have 2 NICs in my 
main PC, one for connecting to the internet via my cable modem and one for 
connecting to the LAN through my hub. The internet connection is then 
shared with the other computers on that hub using Internet Connection 
Sharing (a software router that comes with Windows). Microsoft File and 
Print Sharing is only bound to the copy of the TCP/IP protocol that is 
associated with the NIC connecting to my LAN, so I'm not sharing my files 
and printer with the whole of the internet :)

It sounds like you have 2 discrete IP addresses supplied by your cable 
company, so each machine is on the internet directly, as it were. In this 
case, you have probably been advised to use NetBEUI for security, since 
this protocol is non-routable (only machines on your own subnet, i.e. your 
home LAN, can see the NetBEUI services).

Although random bods on the internet can't print to your printer and snarf 
your files using NetBEUI, I would still run a firewall to guard against 
people installing services that *would* give them access - viruses/trojans 
like BackOffice etc. The free version of ZoneAlarm would do, and seems to 
work OK with Everquest, once you set it up to give the patch program and 
eqgame.exe access to the internet.
