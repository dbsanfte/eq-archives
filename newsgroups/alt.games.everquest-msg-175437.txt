	No.  It means they are NOT blue to a level 50 or 51 character.

	At level 63, something blue to you is going to be WHITE or higher to a
level 50 character.  Furthermore, a level 50 Storms/Valor mob is considerably
tougher than a level 50 terrestial one.  PCs below 60 simply can't carry their
weight in those zones.  For that matter, if you even tried to get a level 50
flagged, you'd might as well have the level 50 guy go stand in the corner
while the other five guys fight.  He'll have the same effect on the fight's
outcome.
