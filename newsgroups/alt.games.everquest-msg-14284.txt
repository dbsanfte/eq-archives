As a level 40 cleric I prefer using Complete Heal as it is very mana
effecient But Never and I repeat Never when I am the only Healer for one it
takes 10sec to cast and is a major agro. If I was in your group I would be
through out Greater Heals most often and a few Superior Heals as needed.
This sounds like a newbie Cleric I dont know if SKs can taunt but even if
you had a couple of Taunters with max skill you can do a thing to keep a mob
of a cleric that just cast 2 complete heals back to back.
