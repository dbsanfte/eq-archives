Don't switch targets when you are DoT kiting.  Just chant one target
down at a time.  If you have all 5 DoTs available, you *can* keep all
5 up and cooking about 95% of the time, despite the wear off messages.
 This is because DoTs only cook on server ticks, and you often have
time to re-DoT the mob before the next server tick.
