For 20pp you will probably only be able to buy one good weapon, but you may
get lucky.  For 2hs I would look for an Axe of the Iron Back 16/37.  For
1hs, look for a Crystal Fiber (8/26) or a Silvery War Axe (6/22). Since you
are in the area you may be able to zone into Permafrost and auction for the
War Axe if someone is camping the King room (be extremely careful traveling
there though, might want to ask for sow and invis).

These are all magical weapons which will allow you to kill the willowisps
you have seen floating around QH and WK, also the ghouls in the SE corner of
WK, although they are too high level for you right now.

For piercing you may be able to pick up a Drachnid Leg Tip (6/27?) cheap,
although I don't think many players carry those around auctioning them. If
you're REALLY lucky you may even get a Messenger of the Queen (20/40) from a
frustrated seller, they are very common and tough to sell.

For your shield, you should be able to pick up a Shiny Brass Shield, 10ac
10svm for around 10pp.

As to where to get these items, head to the auction zone on your server.
Ask around if you don't know.  These zones are usually East Commonlands,
North Freeport, or Greater Faydark.
