I was soloing fine at 49 before the AC nerf. Now at 51 with better 
equipment I can barely solo the light blues I was handling with less than 
half a life bar at 49.

The one thing I am finding that might save my bacon in this regard is 
Instill Doubt... My ID is 167 ATM and rising, and I have the timing down so 
my DPS does not go down to far when using it (as it will not work when your 
special is greyed). I have Run3, which is the thing that makes this 
somewhat doable. Now if only I could find a snare clicky item ;)
