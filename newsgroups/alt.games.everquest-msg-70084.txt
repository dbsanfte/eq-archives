    The second part is the accurate description. On the fairly high MR
spiders in Velk's I've seen it again and again - druid aggros spider, backs
off while tanks do their thing, sits down a fair ways away, and as soon as
Root breaks spider beelines druid and tears him a new one. If you have good
tanks, and if Root lasts, it can get a mob off a player - otherwise it's a
temporary respite.
