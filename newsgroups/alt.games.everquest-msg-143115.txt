I should have been reading more carefully...  you said "INT items" in the
subject.  INT is good, but mana and AC are important to any caster.  HP will
help out more and more as you move up to Call of Bones and then Lich.

That's why the bazaar is so great... you can search by slot and stats.
You'll be able to see if something else better costs slightly more :-)  If
you see an item you like you can search for that item to find the best
price.  From your description it sounds like you're wearing an advisor robe,
which is good.  If your necro were human or erudite I would recommend flayed
skin, since a full suit can usually be found for under 100pp and it has nice
stats, but it is not wearable by dark elves.  I'm not sure if there is
something similar; shadowbound armor might be something to look at, but I
have no idea how much it goes for.

Prices have come down a lot since the bazaar, (at least it seems that way).
Just go there and search a lot, you'll start to get a feel for what
different items cost.  A lot of items that have a sort of "set" price are
higher-end items that cost a lot.  You can probably find lower level gear
that would be an upgrade for you, that people just want to get rid of, so
they sell it cheap.
