What do clerics get that is uniquely detrimental to a mob?

How about rangers?  Sure, they get AM3/EQ, but before those AAs, a warrior can
do as much if not more damage than a ranger with archery.  Don't believe me?
Get a non-AM3/EQ ranger, get a warrior with a good bow, get the warrior into
berserk, and have the warrior back up and just plug away with arrows.  Seen it
done, and it made a number of rangers mad, even ones that did have AM3/EQ.
Sure, each bow shot costs the warrior more vs. the ranger with EQ.

I can't think of anything uniquely shamans, necros, enchanters, bards, paladins,
shadowknights, berserkers, druids, wizards, or mages get either that is uniquely
detrimental.  More than one can snare, slow, debuff, DoT, pet, nuke, stun, mana
drain, fear, DC, banish, mez, charm...
