Bazaar casinos are player run, and are anything goes.  Most either 
blatently favor the house and rely on people using poor judgement, or 
are actual ripoffs; its a simple matter to log on with a free account, 
run a casino till you are hit with a huge payout, and then quit, having 
dumped all the cash you've been bringing in to your real account.

The casino that this thread is talking about, however, is run by SOE, 
NPC's doing all the work.  Its scrupulously honest, which means the odds 
favor the house but its possible to be a winner and walk away feeling 
like you got the best of the situation.  Its far more likely that you'll 
walk away having lost your shirt, but that's how an honest game works.
