Okay, I can't stand it.  I gotta post it.
*Warning - MS lightbulb jokes below*

Q: How many Bill Gateses does it take to change a light bulb?
A: One. He puts the bulb in and lets the world revolve around him.

Q: How many Microsoft executives does it take to change a light bulb?
A: We can see no need for uninstallation and have therefore made no provision
for light bulbs to be removed.

Q: How many Microsoft support staff does it take to change a light bulb?
A: Four. One to ask "What is the registration number of the light bulb?",
one to ask "Have you tried rebooting it?", another to ask "Have you tried
reinstalling it?" and the last one to say "It must be your hardware because
the light bulb in our office works fine..."

Q: How many Microsoft Programmers does it take to change
a light bulb?
A: None. They declare darkness the standard. bom bom.
