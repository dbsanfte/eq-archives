There's a limit to how many peridots I would want to have. I'm only
going to get temperanced so many times in the next year after all.
They have limited value. If yantis wants to buy a few thousand from a
merchant and sell them for $$ what do i care? I stipulated plat drops
would be significantly increased... buying a stack of dots should be a
minor excersise at 50th level...  I don't see a market for them.

>blue diamonds,

Same as dots...I don't die needing a summon corpse *that* often. (And
recall that sellback prices on stackable items have been nerfed so
they can't act as currency of exchange they don't have sell back
value. They only have value in terms of their actual utility; once
everyone's got a couple dozen of these they aren't going to be
terribly valuable to anybody.

Not enough of these to form a basis for a currency. And I don't care
if yantis manages to obtain a few (by trading to the player other
items he wanted) and sell them for $$... that doesn't affect the in
game economy measurably.

Not at all.

I don't really care if the pok buffers suffer a bit... i suppose they
could survive by asking for what they want... be it spider silk or
bone chips or whatever, even plat (to buy a 'horse' layaway token)..
Groups would be unaffected... "bring your own dot".

Clerics wouldn't leave.

Sure.

Also true.

The solution won't prevent him selling stuff it will virtually
eliminate his impact on the market though.
