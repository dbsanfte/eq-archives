A lvl 22 druid friend has offered to power level my lvl 14 druid in EK.

This sounded like a great idea until someone mentioned that PL'ing sucks for
several
reasons:

1) No skill ups on the skills that don't get used.  For example, he was
going to cast
    Shield of thorns on me, and have the mob just damage itself as it
attacked me.
    So if I'm playing porcupine, I can't cast much because of all the
interruption...
    therefore no skill ups on casting.  Trying to skill up later will be
painful because
    I'd have to fight at least blues to get skill ups.  Fighting blues
without good skills
    can be tough unless grouped.

2) Not learning the tactics.  Getting through the levels on your own kinda
forces you
    to learn and develop the tactics that work with the tools you have.  If
I get power
    leveled, I won't learn them as well, or at all.


So, I'm thinking that PL'ing a level or two might be ok, but anything beyond
that is
dangerous.

Other thoughts?
