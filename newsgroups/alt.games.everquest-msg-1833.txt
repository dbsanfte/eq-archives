>There is a reason for that.  No class is as efficient at soloing as a necro.

I'll give ya that (not that I can prove or disprove it either way). But 
there 
are some "inefficiencies".. like extra corpse retrievals because you are KOS 
in your own hometown. Or, having to travel further to buy food because 
merchants won't deal with you. I hated having to zone back into FP from NRo 
because the merchants at the inn wouldn't sell to me.

I guess what I'm saying is that you have to look at the overall class/race 
and 
decide what works for you. Can a necro solo better than a monk or a mage? 
Probably. Does that mean I can't enjoy soloing a monk? Or a mage? Nah. :-)
