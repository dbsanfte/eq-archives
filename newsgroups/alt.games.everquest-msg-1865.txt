"KK-Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"

(moments later)

"I guess making that running leap from the top balcony of the Tower of
Terror after handing in my guild note wasn't such a good idea after all.
Hey at least my first death wasn't by HAILing the guild master."

(by the way-63 points damage from fall {out of 31HP total}).
(also, I have NEVER died by HAILing the guild master and not mapping the
autoattack key first. Not even my first time....I had practiced on a Qeynos
guard first before I even met the guild master...they can hit HARD too.)

What other moments like that has anybody experienced?
(I read a reply (my news server SUCKS so I didn't see the original) of
someone who was bound to the lift in GFay with the lift in the UP position.
Guess what happens when you respawn and the lift is DOWN.)
