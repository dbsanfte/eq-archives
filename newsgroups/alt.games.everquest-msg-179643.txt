that and agp cards run smoother then pci cards..and your other card sounds
like some no brand thing and may not support alot of things EQ runs such as
T&L and tying to push alot on it. Turn off new models on all but vah shir
(because u cant) put on some of that cache stuff in options, turn off social
animations, all that junk that soaks up ram and cpu power..either machine
really is not cutting it anymore for EQ. I suggest at least max out the RAM
in the computers, youll notice a difference..Its a cheaper upgrade then
replacing cpu which would probabbly reguire a new board.
