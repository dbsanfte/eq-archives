But we arent discussing those people who play nice and wait until
the end, we are discussing in this thread when to bail out from
an LDoN group gone bad.


Let me make it graphic:

Scenario: You are the party cleric and your group is about 30
minuites into the addy. The Bard pulls and gets 3, chanter parks
one, one is being OT'd and everyone is with the MT working on
his. The Rogue spots a chest and opens it, releasing 5 to 10 of
those little spiders. The spiders, of course because you have
been both healing and trying to med between heals, go for you.
Everyone is busy with the pulled mobs and your HP is dropping
fast.

What do you do?

This was exactly the situation I encountered 2 weeks ago on Tarew
Marr in BB. I gated when my HP hit 30% and said "Game over."

What did the rogue get? Just a Failed LDoN, the chest was empty.
And added to my /ignore list so I wont group with them anymore.


Several people in this thread have tried to put words in my
mouth, or are taking what I say out of context of this thread. I
have never said that those who want to do the chests cant, I just
dont want them opened with me in the dungeon anymore because of
the bad experiances I have had with them. And I consider someone
doing so [opening chests in the middle of the addy] the point
where I consider the group gone bad enough for me to leave.
