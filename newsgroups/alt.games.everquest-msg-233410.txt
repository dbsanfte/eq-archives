I'd agree with your sentiment.  It's hard for me to comment on LoY in terms
of content and groups because I've used so little of it.  Meanwhile, putting
up LFG and getting an invite to an LDoN group has been pretty easy.  LoY has
some nice features to recommend it - maps, bank space, LFG tool, drogmors -
but it hasn't seemed to create the same kind of buzz that LDoN has.  I've
seen all kinds of characters doing LDoN, including guys with Elemental
Planes gear, so it must have something to recommend it to a wide spectrum of
players.  In general, I would recommend LDoN over LoY.
