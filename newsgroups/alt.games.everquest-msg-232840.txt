I think this is because non merchant mob corpses over level 55 don't
poof where a PC is somewhere (no matter how distantly) on the hate
list.  From memory they coded it this way a few years back because
occasionally a raid would fight Uber Mob X and the pet of a LD caster
would sometimes cause the corpse to evaporate if they got the final
blow.  Which didn't go down well.
