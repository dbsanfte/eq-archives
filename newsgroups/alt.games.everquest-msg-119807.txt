Anyone see a problem with a MONK being the group's puller, main tank, and at
the same time being loot hog for heavy bronze weapons?  Over 2 hours, they
only went to sell one time (apparently had backpacks they were filling).
I'm not complaining so much about the looting of the corpses as soon as the
mob dies (going into a right click frenzy when mob gets low on HP). But the
fact that the monk, who needs to watch their weight, being the main tank,
puller, and carrying heavy items?
