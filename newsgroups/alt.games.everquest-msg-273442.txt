This is the A Cynics Summary of that letter, courtesy of my husband. Gave
me a chuckle or two, especially point #3.


The entire letter can be summed up in three points:

-> Yeah!  We're listening to you.  Trust us, we really do!

-> You maggots don't group enough.  Fine, we give you more solo stuff just
so it'll look like we care.

-> We don't care about the glaring bugs, balance issues, and missing
content that we promised -- but you see, we *care* about the game, we
really do.  Just ... buy the adventure packs, willya?  It'll all be ok if
you do.  No no no, we're not pressuring you.  You don't *have* to buy the
adventure packs, no -- we're still going to focus on nerfi-- I mean adding
bugs-- errr, I mean changing the law of gravit-- dagnabit!!!  I mean we'll
make it better!  Really we will.  Trust us.

Oh yeah, and buy the adventure packs.
