Ok, so being someone who can't stay away from the latest gadget, I
picked up a pair of the 3d glasses from edimensional.com when Casters
Realm came out with the review. I figured they sounded pretty
intriguing and with a money back guarantee what the hell. 2nd day air
and in 2 days they were on my desk at the office (had I gotten it sent
home, I could hear my phone ringing "um, honey, you got ANOTHER box in
the mail today. What did you do now?"
Installation:
When I first got them, installation was fairly straightforward. I have
a visiontek geforce3 and a AMD 1.4 Ghz with 512 RAM. I installed the
latest version of the nvidia detonator drivers 28.32 and the stereo
drivers, both which came on a CD. It actually came with 2 CDs, the
other one being more for ATI cards so I tossed it aside. Actually
plugging the things in took literally 5 seconds. I got the wireless
ones, which come with an adapter that goes between your VGA card and
your monitor cable (pass-through) an infra red transmitter with a
piece of velcro to stick it on top of your monitor, and the glasses.
The glasses themselves were very lightweight and adjustable, so they
fit over my eyeglasses surprisingly comfortably. I was ready to
roll...

Starting Up:
Ok, my first impression was, um, what's going on here. The HUD was a
little off and characters appeared a little pushed to the front. Being
11 PM, i figured this would have to wait until tomorrow to contact
support, but then I remembered it said 24/7 so i decided to see if
they lived up to it. At 11:13 PM, my call was answered on the second
ring. Not bad. The great thing was, the support was helpful and knew a
lot about how to adjust the settings in EQ in particular to make it
look optimal. Not just some guy telling me to hit random buttons, but
he told me how popular they were for EQ and he knew all the best ways
to make it look amazing. I'll pass that info along here to save you
some time:
UseUmbra=false fixed my problem with the NPC's and PC's being drawn
2D. The controls straightened out when I randomly hit cntl-f10. All
the buttons and health bar went to 2D. The mouse pointer is still 2D
which works great for the 2D interfaces but makes targetting the 3D
world a bit more difficult. It'd be nice if the cursor would toggle
between 2D and 3D. Then, CTRL F2 takes the heads up display out of 3d
mode while keeping the rest of the game in 3d.
Ok, so I had the guy still on the phone as I was doing this. OH MY
GOD!!!! OH MY GOD!!!
He started laughing. I almost dropped the phone. My jaw nearly hit the
floor with it. I was in the 3D EQ world...IN 3D!!!Everything looked
AMAZING, I just ran up to creatures just to look at them, like they
were really standing there. I could just reach out and grab them!

Warning:
Everquest is already addictive, so if you are on the verge of total
addiction, DO NOT use these glasses

Conclusion:
Overall, I think these should be at the top of everyone's list of
purchases. If you're really into the game and want to truly feel like
you are a part of it, these are a must have. Great product well worth
my dough and even the Mrs. was impressed! If anyone has any questions,
feel free to shoot me an email at seetheflash00@yahoo.com and i'll do
what I can to answer any questions. Enjoy!
