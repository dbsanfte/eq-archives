I would have to agree. The one poster's suggestion to scale raid-level
gear up when in a raid encounter or "raid mode" and down when they are
in normal group content is kind of ridiculous. The problem isn't that
the items are too powerful outside of raids, it's that they *need* to
be that powerful inside of raids. Raid gear should be better than
anything else, but there are far better options to limit the ways in
which it trivializes group content than introducing an overly-
complicated mechanism like equipment scaling.
