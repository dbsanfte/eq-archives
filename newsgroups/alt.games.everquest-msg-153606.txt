Yeah, this is more what I was  getting at.  Guess I should have been
more clear about exactly WHY I figured Clerics would be screaming.  It
just seems like a real "double nerf" when you combine the fact that
not only is complete heal TECHNICALLY no longer a COMPLETE heal, but
they've also recently given druids/shamans a "baby" complete heal, AND
reduced their healing penalty.
