After the first time, explain to them why they can't run.  Be real direct.  "I
can't hit it if you're running."

I'll give them two freebies, trying to teach them each time, maybe more.  But at
some point, if they haven't already died from running around, I give up, turn
off attack and say, "I can't hit it while you're running.  Sorry.  :(  See you
when you get back to your corpse."  I'm not trying to be shitty, but sometimes
that's the ONLY way they'll learn.
