What often happens is the AC is engaged (therefore it becomes that
characters target, unless he zones or dies) but is killed by someone else.
KS'd in other words.
I didn't make that part clear in my post.
Yes the zone is FFA and until engaged it is anyones but even after it is
engaged it is such a desirable quest people will Steal anyway.

You're right, you can just keep trying, as it would be a single offense
there would be little point in reporting it.
