Heh, senseless isn't it?  Oh sure, naturally I'd want to use parts that are too
big for me to wear in order to make something only the smallest race can wear!

The gloves require no cloth part at all, and oddly a brownie leg.  The cap is
the only underlying part you can wear until you get the drops you need to make
the quest one.  Other than that, you end up with a bag full of clothes from the
big and tall shops that simply aren't going to be worth a thing till you do the
quests.
