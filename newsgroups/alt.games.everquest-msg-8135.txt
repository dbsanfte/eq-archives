Well, maybe I'll try to make some high level friends! :-) My poor Iksar monk 
has a CHA of 55. The silly gnome will probably charge me 15000pp just out of 
spite! :-)

I also read on a message board that a vendor Ak'Anon sells the bag as well. 
That seems like it would be WAY easier, especially if I made a baby gnome to 
buy it for me.
