And they took responsibility for it. It was *officially* sanctioned.

No one is defending 19th century imperialism here. The poor behavior
of imperialists in the past (and that includes the US, btw, both the
Phillipines and Cuba were imperialist acquisitions) doesn't excuse the
hands-off imperialist behavior of multinationals today, most (but not
all) of whom are based out of the States, which *doesn't* take any
responsibility for it.
