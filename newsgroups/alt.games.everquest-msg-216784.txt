i heard that 'the whole nine yards' comes from coal purchasing in the early
20th century (OOOH we all sound like we live in the future now, boy!)

i don't remember the specifics, but it was something like..........coal came
in some kind of yard-length unit, and the delivery trucks only held nine?
i'm pretty sure there's a truck involved somewhere, but nine one yard blocks
of coal sounds like an awful lot if the units were cubes, but not very much
if they were flat, like a pallette-full-o-coal.....see now i'm going on and
on, and this is why i don't tell jokes

*grumble* =P
