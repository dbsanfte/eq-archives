This was what the original plan was all about. Since I was bored with what I
could do on Faydwer at my level, why not take a trip across the other
continent, pick up some songs, hopefully some xp and come back ready for DC
and Lfay. Of the 13 songs between lvels 14 and 24, 6 are either in HH keep
or Erudin (3 apiece). I had built up some extra PP, why not buy the songs
and bank what I couldn't use? Plus I figure that every area has something
for you to check out. What I didn't count on is how dangerous some of these
areas are. I figured High Hold Pass/Keep would be like any other city - a
fairly safe zone. And at this point, the only thing that has smoked me on
the road is a higher level bard. I also had this delusion that now I had
raised my AC to over 300, I might be able to take some blows and keep on
running. A kodiak bear disspelled that illusion today when I was trying to
kite him. My old friend "you are stunned" came up (is this just a bard
thing, or does this happen to everyone?). Anyway, I made it as far as
Rivervale and chickened out as I began to read a few of your posts. Kited
Kodiaks up to lvl16. Now I'm back in Rivervale and I think I may use one
suggestion. Bank anything I'm not attached to and make a run for it. The one
twist I think I'll use is to buy some cloudy potions and use them. Go io
HHK, buy my spells and book back to Rivervale. If that works, I'll think
about Queynos. Yeah I suppose I could port there, but what is the adventure
in that? It's fun beating up the MOB's but it's more enjoyable to win a
challenge then a barrell shoot. I'll just have a fresh change of underwear
ready for when I zone into Highhold and see "There is one player in this
zone". And that would be me.
