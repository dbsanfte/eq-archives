My Paladin just hit 40, and will be leaving the Thurgadin mines soon.
Looking at my equipment, I'm a bit on the hurting side for some of these
things.  Can anyone give me some pointers on what I should be wearing at
this point?  Note, my guild is a social guild, so simply snagging some Kael
armor isn't quite in the picture.  Also, I'm one of those fashion freaks.  I
finally stopped getting asked for SoW when I started wearing plate, and I
don't particularly want that to change.  I've added the specs so those who
want to respond don't have to go look them up (hey, I'm asking for help, the
least I can do is make things easier for y'all).

Weapon:  Shieldstorm - 22/45 AC 15, Str 5, Dex 10, AGI 15, Resists 5
(ghoulbane and a Clay guardian shield when I'm fighting casters or undead)
Ear:  Cougar Claw Earring - AC 4, Str 3, Dex 2, Orc Fang Earring - AC 3, Str
3, HP 15
Neck:  Azure Stained Leather Gorget - AC 8, Str 3, Wis 3, Mag 5, Fire 5
Face:  Silver Ruby Veil - Str 4, Wis 4
Head:  Helm of Ro - AC 13, Wis 8
Shoulder:  Adamantite Epaulets - AC 9, Wis 7
Finger:  Silver Jasper Ring x2 - Wis 2 (bah, these seriously need an
upgrade)
Wrist:  Serpentine Bracer AC 1, Agi 9, Dex 3, Hardened Kodiak Bracer AC 6,
Str 3
Arm:  Fine Plate Vambraces - AC 10
Chest:  Breastplate of Ro - AC 20, Str 4, Fire 10
Back:  Dire Wolf-hide Cloak - AC 7, Str 5
Feet:  Charred Boots - AC 6, Agi 3, Poison 5, Fire 5
Legs:  Greaves of Ro - AC 13, Sta 6, Cold 10
Waist:  Flowing Black Silk Sash (the -only- roll I've ever won) - Needs no
introduction.
Hands:  Sebilite Scale Gloves - AC 12, Agi 4, Int 4, Mag 2, Disease 2

The Ro pieces I quested myself.  Very rewarding to finish a quest with
something that was actually useful to me.

I'm looking at the Blessed Knight armor quests (twilight sea), anyone have
any thoughts on that?

Thanks in advance.
