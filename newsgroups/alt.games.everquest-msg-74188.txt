Ok, I'm only allowing myself this one post, since I'm sure quite a few don't
care. ; )

But for those who do, last night at six am, I finally managed to make Warlord
status.   I must say too that that last blue bubble of 59 was painful.  I
think the damn thing took over three hours to fill....  but there was no way
in hell I was leaving while I was that close. ;)

The fight was somewhat less than dramatic.  I didn't time it so that the exp
from getting an epic weapon would put me over the edge or anything *grin*
(besides, I doubt I'll ever finish the warrior epic.)  The final mob was a
level 50'ish Gorgana Lookout in The Maiden's Eye.     It missed being the
level 58 Gorgana Chieftain (who dropped his rare, a 15 AC 15 Wis 15 Int 35
mana range slot item) by about 5 kills, and missed being a Xin Thall Centien,
55 - 58 mobs, very tough, by about 2 kills either way.  We had just killed 2
and I was clearing the way back for 2 or 3 more when I dinged.


It came at the end of a very good day.   Our guild got invited by an ex-member
to send people to help his guild kill Trakanon.  I went along with 7 others in
guild, and we were successful on the first try.  (not even very many deaths)
One of our guild rangers ended up getting the Tolan's Chestplate from that
fight.   Our newsgroups own Dennis, who got the legs off VS less than a week
before.   (Congrats! Venture Uber Ranger!)

Ok, I'll stop bothering you guys now.   Just really wanted to share. ; )

Dearic
Arbiter Warlord of Kaladim
