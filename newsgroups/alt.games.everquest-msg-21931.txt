Stun and Fear use very little mana, most pulls I have to throw a celestial
at someone, too... but a fight lasts plenty long enough to med that back
My group mates are constantly reporting 60M and 50M at fights end
and growling at my 95M reports!

When a pull goes bad in a good group, I have my party hand over the
mod rods, mage make a few more maybe, celestial myself, and I'm
back at 60M+, fully healed and ready to go.  Mage has to burn lighter
than normal for a pull or two till she's handed out a new set of rods
to all, but no biggie.  Alternately, Necro Lich up, pump mana to me,
I celestial him, repeat... its obscene how  quickly that combo can
put a duo back to 80M each and full health.

Bards are more than adequate for mana supply, but for mez they are definately
running second fiddle, much like saying if you can't find a cleric a druid will
do as a healer.  If you are relying on a bard for crowd control they need
to be very good (and a very good bard is indeed a joy to behold) while a
chanter need be no more than adequate in most circumstances.

Because you grew up in dungeons and I've spent 90% of my life outdoors...
even indoors I mainly am in big zones like Kael Drakkar, where there's plenty
of room to do root parking without adds.

Celestial is the premier heal in the game, no question.  Whatever did we
do before velious came out?

Aye, I delight in having more mana left at end of fight than the others,
although I wouldn't feel that way if I didn't think I was contributing
-significantly- to each battle.  Getting the fights tuned up so that
I don't have to chain heal and burn mana as fast as a wizard trying
to KS the AC is one of my goals in life.  Imagine my surprise when
testing demonstrated in a recent battle that chain celestial-ing my
paladin partner was my most mana efficient strategy.  Me, a healer?
Who'd have thought?

That is an alternative, and it has the added feature of instant mana
regeneration,
you can just stack the bodies neatly to one side and res em all afterwards
so as not to have to suffer mana loss and regen effects during the raid!

I stopped caring about exp when I hit 49, actually.  Wanted that
90% res in the worst way, and it astonishes me to this day that
especially towards the end guildmates weren't lining up to come
PL me.  After all, they were certainly using my services regularly,
despite the fact that I winced every time I cast the little 50% res.
I finally got so desperate that I spent half of both levels 47 and 48
soloing!

On the other hand, I have an inherant dislike for the KS strategy,
if we are raiding a place together, we should all be getting
our share of the benefits.  The "fun" of being in a raid will
happen regardless of who gets the exp, so although its frequently
brought up whenever the exp factor is mentioned, its really unrelated.
Similarly, the loot factor is normally distributed fairly, so it is also
irrelevant...or worse yet worsens things, as most of the people on
any given raid find themselves not eligible for the drops in that
area anyway.  If you can thus isolate exp, the big difference
between a raid and a group is that in a raid, each kill one
group gets all the exp.  In a fair, well set up raid, the kills
generally fall back and forth more or less evenly, at least
with a little work structuring groups.  When you see all the
nukers in one group or another going balls to the wall in
order to get the EXP, then you have a broken raid.  Further,
you see me having to res those people again and again when
they went overboard and aggroed things they shouldn't have.

When you set up a raid along strategic lines instead of in some vague
effort to be fair, then I'm not the least bit worried about exp, never was.
It can really be pleasant, too, not the least because the pressure is
off.

The atone for XP thing, few times I've done it, was not anything I
was doing secretly.  Plan set up in advance with the raid leader,
we used me so that there was no need to worry about the delicate
balance of damage production... each group could be told exactly
when to dump an extra nuke in to get their turn at the exp trough.
Alas, that was on a different server, in a guild that (as the golden
haze of nostalgia shows it) less filled with greed and more with
a desire to make sure everyone was benefitting from whatever we
did as a unit.

Back at the level when I first got my third stun, aye, it was mana intensive.
But now, many levels later, casting a series of low level spells in order to
assure shutdown seems pretty inexpensive, most fights even if I lay
chainstun on start to finish take less mana than two celestials would.  On
the other hand, I'm also not in a situation where I can shrug at the effects
of most casters like you suggest.  Drakes AOE strips buffs and does
up to 500 damage per person, thats a -lot- of mana wasted reapplying
buffage, even if I don't have to res one of the casters for the crime of
staying in range long enough to get hit twice.

I hear that the changes to DA mean you -won't- have things on you, but I
see a flaw in that reasoning.  If you DA, that's 18 seconds longer the mobs
have to kill your buddies, while you can't be evaced out or healed or
do anything constructive except perhaps run for the zone line or mem
something you should have had ready beforehand.  DA, it seems to me,
is best situated on a hotkey

/shout CLERIC CAMPING OUT
/cast 8

in order to limit the amount of time the mobs have to beat on my defenseless
body while I camp out.

Celestial lets me heal tanks =before= they need healed.  I can hit
every tank in my group with celestial in a chain of casting, and go
back and patch the one with main aggro with superior or complete
as needed.bits not good for non tanks, I'll grant you, for them I have
GHeal, if Celestial is too slow then so is SHeal, not to mention that they
probably won't be using all the heal.

Thing is, other than the longer cast time, celestial isn't much worse
than GHeal on its first tick, and they will be getting several more
ticks of heals.  Although its not all that much more heal than
superior, its less likely to be wasted

One stun does that job more reliably than "heal and hope it pisses him
off,"  I find, as it doesn't even have to distract.  Heal for aggro works
fairly well when the puller is inbound, to get -all- the love, and then
depending on the amount of overpull I may actually be unable to
channel anything at all.  Immobilize might be the most practical
plan there, as I can back away and have less to channel thru for
the next target.  Again, my imagination puts me outdoors with
lots of room to space em out though.

Still, if I need to get it off the chanter ASAP then I sure can't
rely on heal to do that.  Nice that the chanter gets healed
whether it works or not, but for the enchanter to get the love
in the first place, she's tried something (and likely failed it)
that already has her high on the list.  While heal can and
does overcome that, I've never found it reliable... I get
aggro when I didn't want it and not when I do.  Only
benefit of the heal to aggro strategy I can think of is
that its good at pulling -all- the adds that haven't been
touched by anyone yet.

Yep, I love the outdoors.  My first cleric spent about 70% of her time
indoors, while Bergh has spent more than 90% of his life in the great
wide open... which as it occurs to me is bass ackwards for a Brellion,
but Bergh has always focussed on the heavy drinking portion of Brell's
teachings.

Don't use the word nerf in the same paragraph with celestial please.  Oops,

Haven't tried that yet, after all my "love the wild outdoors" posts I'm working
the indoors area of the grotto.  Least it isn't as tight as LGuk.

Also, been playing more with people of long association, so the "move its
rooted"
strategy is already in place.
