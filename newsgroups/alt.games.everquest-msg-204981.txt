Hi folks,

I remember reading from one of the threads that you can add a line
into the eqclient.ini file which will cut down on the zoning time.
Something along the lines of LoadUmbral something or another, heh. Is
that for Umbral Plains only, or did I remember it completely wrong? If
this line cuts down load time for all zones, what does it actually do?

By the way, any other lines I should add/edit into eqclient.ini
(besides the Luclin models whihc I have disabled)? Just started EQ
this past weekend.

Thanks.
