Hi Wayne,

You got to go to http://www.station.sony.com/en/services/help/help.jsp and
click on the "Chat Live with Customer Support" link.
The link is only active during the hours the service is open from 9AM to 9PM
PST, monday to friday.

This is efficient. A friend used it 2 weeks ago because he had problem to
create a second accountfor his wife (they just bought a 2nd computer). They
couldn't create the 2nd account for some reason and a tech sorted their
problem very quickly.

Hope this helps, and best of luck to have your character back.
