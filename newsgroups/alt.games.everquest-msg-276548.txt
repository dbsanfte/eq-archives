The Concordance of Research is ONLY for the practice runes. It will
not show other recipes.

There are two places I check when I need something that I can't find.
If it's used in a tradeskill, odds are the www.eqtraders.com will know
where to get it. If not in there, try Allakhazam's site. The comments
underneath an item are sometimes more up to date than eqtraders.

Another problem you might be having is that not all recipes will be
listed in any container. You will have to do a successful combine
before certain recipes will be listed in your container. EQTraders
should be able to help you out on making a successful combine even
without having the recipe in either of your books.
