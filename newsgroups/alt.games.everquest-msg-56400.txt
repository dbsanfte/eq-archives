Did you even bother to read my original post?  Obviously not, or you're too
stupid to comprehend what I posted.

It has nothing to do whether or not anyone agreed with me.  My question wasn't
"who likes aol?", my question was "does anyone have problems with aol 7.0 and
eq?"

How about you go back and read my original post?  Then perhaps you could offer
some insight.... oh wait.... you couldn't do that even if you wanted to.

Troll.
