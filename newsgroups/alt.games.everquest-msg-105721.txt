I've saved numerous people this way.  See someone jumping and strafing to 
stay just 1 step ahead of a nasty mob, invite them, wait for the 'OMG this 
is fast!'

This was probably true at one point long ago, resists over 255 wrapped, 
which was rather annoying.  It has not been true for a long, long time.  
It has not been active since I've been raiding.  Every few months someone 
else brings it up in /ooc, and we have nice, zone-wide discussions about 
it.  We had been in ToV for the previous 3 hours though, and I was sitting 
with resists of 300-400 and taking minimal damage from AE, so it wasn't a 
global problem if it's not intended.

I figured as a Euro you would kill Wuoshi pretty regularly.  Until Verant 
started staggering post-patch spawn times, Wuoshi seemed to be killed 
immediately after a patch by whichever guild had enough force (generally 
Euro or Asian).

I tested it last week in Western Wastes.  One of our Paladins had just 
received his Holy Steed, so we decided to race from the Myga pulling rock 
in the SW corner to the SG zone.  I took off, looked back, and thought 
that he didn't hear the start signal.  I turned around, ran back, and 
passed him just as he finally got up to speed.  I turned around again, and 
was well behind him.  I passed him, ran to the CS zone line, said hello to 
a cleric medding them, then ran back out of the tunnel just as he was 
running in.  It's really, really fast.  I *think* I run at 255% of normal 
running speed, which makes perfect sense now that I look at the number.   
(If normal runing speed were 60mph, I would be running 153mph.)
