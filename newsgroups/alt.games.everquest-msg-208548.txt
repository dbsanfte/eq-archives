Nowhere have I said that a caster wouldn't make that choice. I probably
would myself, though I'm far from an uberguilder and my character's int only
is maxed only because I haven't spent the AA to raise the cap.

However, if  you look at what I actually wrote, you should be able to infer
that I was talking about extending this trend to several slots, and then the
decision becomes a bit more difficult.

Call me crazy, but I suspect SOE made a mistake, and that +25 wis was
intended to be +25 int.

And lay off the personal stuff, it doesn't help your argument in the least.
