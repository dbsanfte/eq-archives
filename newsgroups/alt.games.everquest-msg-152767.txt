I am, the Greek Pantheon, specifically Artamis, but I don't ignore the
others.  Interestingly enough, I was talking to a friend the other day and
besides having a few other things in common that are quite uncommon, I
learned that his wife is also a Pagan.  How cool is that?

I am upfront when people ask me about my druid's name, mostly because it
pisses me off to think that people think I named my character after Sailor
Moon.  *bigggg shudder*.  Even Lyrral's name was taken from the name of a
Nymph, but it's pretty much too obscure for those who rely on Disney and
Xena for their Greek Pantheon lesson.
