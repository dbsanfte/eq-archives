Id hazard a guess the top 100 monks in the game don't rate MB as "THE" monk
site.

Just because nothing else is available / widespread / popular at your level,
doesn't make MB gospel, nor does it make the random "l33t" players any less
stupid for flaming rants demanding root, snare, slow, root in order to
regain "class balance".. lmao.  Add insta cheal to that list too.. or maybe
just immunity to all spells and hits.. maybe that will appease some people.

Wha wha wha.. melees and casters will NEVER be balanced. What the fuck does
this paste have to do with the argument at hand?

Btw.. fear doesn't work on mobs 55+.. which is almost all of PoP and GoD..
and monks DO get fear anyway,
So.. grats on pasting a dumbasses post. I can see why you took a shine to
his words.

Lol, good old MB. The board has a nack of making all other classes look like
kings. I mean if you believe the shit posted there, Paladins are really
close to monk dps !!

My guild has a broad mix of monks and bards.. we have some exceptional
players, and we have some very inexperienced / nonhardcore players...

I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt, our less experienced bards do
not even come CLOSE to touching the monks for pullability.  We do have one
bard, a very modest chap who won't admit it, but plays an absolutely dream
bard. He is easily the best bard I've ever seen (across 2 servers)..
exceptionally skilled..  in the right environment, he can be a real star, to
monk and higher level.  The right environment isnt that cut and dry though,
it doesn't include GoD raid zones for a few reasons, and in potime they
cannot perform at the same pace as monks because mana could just not keep up
with the continous fades required to split p3 into smaller pulls.

I would take him on pulls over anybody but the top monks in my guild, but
with those, he/we are all just part of a core team that excel in different
situations.  In the same way our top bard can do so called "monk" pulls
better than our more lacking monks.. our top monks can beat bards hands down
on so called "bard" pulls if the bard isnt at the top of their game.

Well sure, a dumb bard can beat a dumb monk because they start out with
spells that can "automatically" split mobs.
A monks splitting skill is a time learnt process (which started before the
days of lull). Learing the tricks of the trade takes you far above that
level though.

So sure, monks are not necessarily automatic pullers of choice now, not
pullers of choice in every single scenario, but then neither is a bard.
Different classes are stronger in different areas, which is pretty much the
whole point of the game. Different classes come together to compliment and
enhance each other, to achieve better things by working as a team.

Yes bards offer a lot of other things too, CC, slow, mana, haste etc... but
those are all skills more along the enchanter line. They don't offer the DPS
that monks do. I don't see either class always getting picked ahead of the
other, I do see a group that has an enchanter or shaman already more likely
to go for a monk, and vice versa, though.

The guilds i follow with interest all use monks to pull their raids.. which
whatever level that may be.. is an equal challenge to the guild.  Nerfs sure
didn't make pulling easier, but it also sure as hell didn't cripple the
class to stop them being able to do so.  Recent enhancements have also gone
a long way to counter-balancing the mitigation nerf too.

You have 2 choices in the game. Sit and cry, stamp your feet that AC nerfs,
new pathing systems etc have ruined your class, or you can get on with it.
Adjust to how things work now, and rise from a nerf to be even better, to
gain newer better skills in dealing with the same/different situations.

Some people are never happy with what they get.  Sure monks could use some
new features, im sure every other class would say the same too. But they are
FAR from being gimped, useless and ruined classes.
