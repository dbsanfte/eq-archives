You definitely need to have a warning about the great many inaccuracies
contained in the EQ manual.

You should define acronyms the first time you use them.  Also, MUD is
not in glossary.

I believe the statement that people with the expansion could advance
beyond 50 is slightly inaccurate.  I think that after RoK was released,
everybody could advance past 50, just not go to Kunark or start an Iksar
character.

I think this should be changed to "misguided and ineffective effort" but
that is a completely personal opinion.

You might want to include a line specifically for Outlook users since
they are the biggest sinners in this one reguard.  I'd include the
instruction for how to make sure this is turned off in Outlook, but I
don't have it installed on any of my computers at home.

Don't underquote either.



All in all, a pretty good first draft.
