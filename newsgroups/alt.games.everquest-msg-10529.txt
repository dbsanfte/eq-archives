You see my point?  This braindeadnik thinks its just fine to have posts
flying around entitled "The Jewish Plague", but it is an abomination in his
sight to see:  "My Big Kosher Pickle: eat it."

He better fucking eat it.  He *will* eat it.

You see my point, how this totally unconscious rat-turd for a mind thinks he
can get away with perpetuating this Anti-Semitic trash and suffer no
consequences for it. There need to be consequences. There may well come a
day that he'll need a lot more than a "killfile" to crawl into, if there is
any way that a Jewish Underground can come into existence which will have a
"killfile" of its own.

But, like both Jews and Gentiles around here say, I'm not Jewish so it's not
my red wagon, is it?  I will just pray for the day that big brave Jews will
wake up and decide to deal seriously with these Anti-Semite rats for once
and for all in a Final Solution.
