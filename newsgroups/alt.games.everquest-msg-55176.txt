OOT, after gathering in East Freeport, and the Deep Tomb didn't look
like any ship I have ever seen before. I didn't get any pictures of it
before it 'disappeared', but it was see-through, had a skull at the
bough, a large room with a roof on the deck - reminded me more of the
boat to FV than of Bloated Belly.

By the way, I strongly recommend heading to www.afflictionguild.com
(Cadfael's guild) and reading about the uberquest they got on
Tuesday...
