Yeah, but a duo should be able to make the trip easily. I held king room 
in SolA at 25th with a Pali friend. (I had a bard, both characters would 
have fit within your guilds rules if it had been around at the time... I 
was wearing quested newbie armour had bogling weapons, and was farming 
the lambant bits at the time, pali was wearing the Deep Sea Mail stuff 
for Eru palis -- the bp from Mugglewump. and the matching legs/arms; not 
sure whether he'd finished questing Ghoulebane at the time...)

Getting to the gnome was already trivial at that point.

Specters in Oasis are probably doable too...they're nice and slow so not 
having sow is less of an issue, and the scythes they drop range in value 
from a gold for a rusty to a dozen pp for a regular. They tend to be 
easier than giants, imo, and the xp will be pretty solid too.

Hunting in SolA itself is also pretty good... FS drops like water in 
there.
