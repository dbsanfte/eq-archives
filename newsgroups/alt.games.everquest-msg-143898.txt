    We just got to the area prior to Aten last night, and there's a few
"features" in the area that might constitute the "mitigating factors" LoS
cites in their defence. There's some teleporters, one-way walls, and the
Grav Flux variant the mobs cast is pretty buggy. How buggy? We had a crowd
of people trapped against the roof, in a pile, for a minute after one GFlux.
They couldn't fall until other people in the pile ducked, pushed, and
managed to squirm their way loose. In that one area it was typical to get
trapped against the roof after a GFlux (although we learned quickly how to
get down fast). I could envision a scenario where someone gets blown up
through the roof and on top of the room, runs around up there looking for a
way back down, and finally drops back down.

    Now I'll say for the record that I have no idea if that happened, or if
they did use dubious tactics to do the pull. I just hope we don't "exploit"
tonight. =(
