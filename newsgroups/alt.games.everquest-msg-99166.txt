Nek forest is a lot tougher for that than it used to be.  Pick a nonsocial
mob for your fearkiting.  Be sure you snare the mob fist with you clinging
darkness, that way he won't run very fast.  My cleric has been fearkiting
yellow skeletons in Nek when he can find them.  The problem he has is a
complete lack of ability to hit the broadside of a barn due to extemely low
offensive skills at level 4.
