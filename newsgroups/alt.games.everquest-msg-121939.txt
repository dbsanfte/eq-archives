Yeah..it breaks the rules, but only the one about drug references. Hemp has
been used for hundreds of years, for various purposes, so the name itself
would be in keeping with the time-period of EQ. Was this guy a renegade
druid or ranger? As we all know, these classes are treehuggers (hippies) and
it would be in keeping with the roleplaying side of the game to have the
possibility of a druid or ranger who just doesnt know when to stop.

Also Shaman should have a right to use psychedelic drug references in their
names, as shaman have historically used these types of drugs in order to
produce visions.
