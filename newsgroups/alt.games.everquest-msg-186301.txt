Hey man the fact the server's economy is so depressed is the only
reason I have hope of affording the legs at ALL. :-p

Fierce Heraldic armor is for the most part better than Skyshrine quest
armor for warriors. On test, where E/WToV are never done anymore, that
is by far my best hope of decency.

I'm slowly moving up though. :-) Two pieces of cobalt and one fierce
healdic. Still have major problem spots at legs, shoulders, and back
though.
