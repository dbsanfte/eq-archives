It is good experience, no doubt about it.  I first hunted it back when
hoi polloi were still in SK quarreling about every last chicken wing,
and I was amazed.  It isn't so much the experience per kill as the
incredible spawn rate and the sheer number of mobs (much like kodiaks
in GD at, say, 35).  But, like you and Richard, I either hunted with
friends or soloed.

I still take my alts there.  But I wouldn't dream of joining a pickup
group and I turn ooc off the minute I arrive :)
