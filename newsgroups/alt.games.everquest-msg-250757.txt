This looks like a very common assumption that it doesn't pay to spend 2x to
gain 1.5x. But I don't think that's the approach that analysts will use. I
believe analysts are going to try and divine a long term view (most of them
are making recommendations to institutional investors who are primarily long
term growth investors). A good analyst recognizes that companies need to
make investment in growth, they will always cut you slack on this if they
believe the plan is sound and the execution ability present. And over what
period of time do you measure the results? Investment in growth by its
nature occurs in the years prior to reaping of the benefits, so a proper
analysis should look something like "given the company's current cash
position, can they afford to make the current investment and if so what will
be the return on that investment in x years forward". Suppose analysts come
up with something like this: "The company will spend 2x in year 1 as an
investment in future growth for the product line. This year's earnings are
expected to remain flat or possibly decline minimally due to charges related
to this investment and an anticipated 1.5x return in year 1, but earnings
are expected to rise substantially based on forecasts of 3-4x revenues in
years 2-3 and even higher in years 4-5". That kind of report could up the
rating and have a much larger impact on shareholder value than any short
term (temporary) hit to profitability.
