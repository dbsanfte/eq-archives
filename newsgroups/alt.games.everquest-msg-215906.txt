It's monks and rogues with instill doubt.  :)  Paladin and the two clerics
were the only possible fear'ers (unless it was an animal mob for the
rangers, and...  don't know many rangers that keep fear loaded unless they
are soloing).

I actually use instill doubt constantly in LDoN, but that's cause it's about
the only "taunt" I have available and I haven't successfully feared a mob in
about two years now (and never did have much luck with it even when the mobs
weren't too high).
