It doesn't takes more than a couple of hours to get a level unless you solo.
Had a full group in wailing caves, all level 13 or 14, for about 3 hours
during which we all got a level. The next day it took me less than an hour
to get another level by going and talking to a few NPCs to complete the
quests I had gotten the kills for in the caves.
Hardly call it a grind if it takes 4 odd hours for 2 levels, most of it in a
talkative group.
