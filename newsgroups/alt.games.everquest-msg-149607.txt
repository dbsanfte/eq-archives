I posted here a few days ago with a problem I was experiencing when I tried
to play EverQuest with my new Linksys 4-port router (model BEFSR41 ver. 2).
I was experiencing frequent disconnects. The longest I could stay connected
was about an hour. Sometimes as little as 10 minutes. Apparently, this is a
known issue with that particular router.

Here are the steps I followed in order to get it working.

1. Updated my firmware at http://www.linksys.com/download. I am now running
version 1.43 (9/4/02). I'm not sure if this is necessary or not. Probably
not. But I did it anyway.
2. I went into my router setup ( http://192.168.1.1 - default password is
admin) and then clicked on ADVANCED / FORWARDING / PORT TRIGGERING.
3. A new window will pop up. For APPLICATION NAME, type EverQuest. For
TRIGGER PORT RANGE, type 1023 in the first box and 9999 in the second box.
For INCOMING PORT RANGE, type 1023 in the first box and 9999 in the second
box. Then click APPLY.
5. That's it! I played for 3 hours last night without a single disconnect.

I hope this helps someone else. And a big thanks needs to go out to the
people in the group for pointing me in the right direction. THANK YOU!
