Hey Annie...good point, Tunare knows that I've had my fair share of "d00d,
sow me" .... I don't know what a good compromise is, but it just seems like
a lot more dumbing down lately.  Even if I didn't play a Druid, I still
think that the PoK books were more detrimental than beneficial.  Since PoP,
it's not really a world anymore...more of a big room with a lot of doors.
Maybe I'm just too naive, and hoped that they'd address actual problems in
the game rather than just petty nonsense like a new port stone or whatnot.

Cheers,
-Wal
