Ok, I use this "arrow key to ability" technique ALL THE TIME :-)  It is great and
really helps with skill ups.

Here's what you do.  Dedicate one of your hot keys (I make mine #10) to be the hot
key that gets hit whenever you hit your left or right arrow button.  Then you either have
something safe in the hot key slot or nothing at all.

Ok, let's assume you picked hot key #10 like I did.  That's the lower, right-hand one.

1) Hit F10 to get into the non-windowed mode.
2) Click Options.
3) Click Keyboard.
4) Click the down arrow icon till you find User-defined 10
5) In the first of the two boxes beneath it, left-click your mouse.  The cursor should now
    be in the first box.
6) Hit your Left Arrow button.
7) In the second of the two boxes beneath User-defined 10, RIGHT-click your mouse.
    The cursor should now be in the second box.
8) Hit your Right Arrow button.
9) Hit F10 till you get back to fullscreen mode.
10) Click Abilities
11) Click drag and drop Sense Heading (or other skill) into Hot Key 10.

Now try turning left or right... you should see Hot Key 10 gray out as if you had pressed it
directly.  You can also place socials (macros) in this hot key slot).  On my monk, I use
it for training feign death, so it does a feign death, then stands up again.

Some might call this an exploit.  I'm not convinced it is because the things you are practicing
are things you would be doing anyway as you are moving around... sensing direction, practicing
sneaking, feigning death  (lol).  It's a bit of a gray area, admittedly.
