At 26 you will do fine in a group. Forget all about casting on the monsters
or meleeing (shouldnt have to say this anyway), as they will be all red. You
have greater heal, and thats all that matters. Some people wont know any
better and will say 26 is just too low (which would be right for most other
classes), but with the demand on healers in OT, i dont think youll have too
much problem finding a group. I went to OT at 28 with my cleric and had no
problems at all.
