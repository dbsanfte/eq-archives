Dfinitions vary slightly. Some people only consider it twinking if the
gear came from one of your own characters. Others only consider it
twinking if the above is true or it came from a friend. Random
donations don't count to them. Hardly anyone except purist elitists
really seems to have an issue with twinking, though.
