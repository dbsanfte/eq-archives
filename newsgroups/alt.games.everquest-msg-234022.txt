I do use spellsets, and I'm not talking necessity, I'm talking about
something that would be nice to have.  For example, I usually don't have CoH
memmed, but it would be nice to be able to have it up and ready to pull
someone out of a tight situation on occasion.  I don't understand anyone who
doesn't think that more spell gems is better.  Maybe not a necessity, but
better.
