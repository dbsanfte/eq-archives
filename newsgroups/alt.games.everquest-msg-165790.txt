Maybe the cleric epic is common on your server. I saw my first one on
Firiona Vie a few weeks ago in the bazaar and I haven't seen one since.

I didn't say I was recruited by end game guilds. On our server there are top
guilds depending on what level you are. In fact, there's really only one
truly uber guild for the end game on our server and one that's close.

Raids are also sadly less common.
