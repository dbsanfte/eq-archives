No, you are talking elitest rubbish and class envy. Warriors are not
build to do damage, they are built to take it, and even paladins and SKs
have comparable AC these days at the highest levels. Hell, we've even
got a druid touching 15000AC I think. Exactly what high level raids
SPECIFICALLY have you had experience on to be able to talk about 'MOST
raids'
