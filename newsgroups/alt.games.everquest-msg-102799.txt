Just a friendly thought Bebinn...if you know you made mistakes when starting
the first time...start over!  I have played multiple characters and deleted
many, including  46 paladin, 40 cleric, 34 druid, etc...all deleted because
I found issues with them I didn't like.  Don't be afraid to use what you
have now and start a new character...seems tough I know, but you will be
surprised how fast you will level second time around...especially with new
ruleset (no equip loss till lvl 10, no book at all while medding...super,
duper exp 1-10 and in dungeons...heck, I started a new chanter on Friday
around noon and dinged 16 around 8pm CST Sunday...and that's with doing RL
stuff here and there (though admittedly I had 14 hours playtime by
then)....but my BEST advice would be to start over and distribute your stats
better...no one is perfect in their first RPG experience and mistakes are
just that...to learn from...enjoy...
