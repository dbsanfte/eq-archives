I find that console games are more replayable than PC games because
console developers can't rely on a hardware upgrade every 6 months that
will provide 90% of the appeal for the new title. At least that's how it
was before they realised how crap PC games were and started using lazy
"complete the game 300 times on Hard to unlock a new loading screen"
excuses for replayability.

It already happened. That's why all these companies are going bust. They
gambled on having high sales for a couple of months due to the graphical
supremacy.

For fifty dollars I once bought about 100 books. People who see newly
released movies and buy newly released games are the biggest morons in
the ENTIRE world.
