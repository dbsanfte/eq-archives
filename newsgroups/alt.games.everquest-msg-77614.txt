Not sure, but seems to me the fix for this would be rebuilding the zone,
something they seem to do very rarely since the downloading of new zone
files is such a large amount of data and in some parts of the world
folks are still using telephone modems to connect (!  the horror).  Mobs
in the pit tend to path into the wall and right on through.  Unless you
have a necro/sk type pet who can ignore the z axis and keep hitting them
or you have non LoS spells to finish the mob all you can do is run for
the zone or die.  To prevent them from doing this would either require
some really heavy duty pathing code which they don't want to do (see
mobs hitting through walls in any zone as an example of why not) or
remaking the zone itself with pathing barriers like they use at zone
edges to prevent both mob and player from passing, resulting in that
download they don't want to force on everyone.  I wouldn't really expect
this to be fixed based on that.
