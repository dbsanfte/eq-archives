German history. A guy start world war 2 and kill around 5 million jews.

Ireland. People kill each other due to a religious conflict.

European history in general. People kill each other due to religious 
conflicts.

World in general, both history and now. People kill each other over 
power, money, religious conflicts, arguments, jealousy, stupidity, and 
loads of other reasons.


Conclusion:
Mankind been killing each other since we came down from the trees, 
nothing changed due to computer games.
