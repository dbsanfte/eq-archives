Blargh, meant generalization, not justification.  In reference to the 'by 
definition' argument elsewhere in the thread, specifically the second 
definition.  You have proven that all AA is racism if we accept that all AA 
is either prejudicial or discriminatory.  If you believe that, I would say 
you have not sufficiently researched AA.  And the reason the broad 
generalization can't be justified has nothing to do with that, even, but 
rather with that it's talking about actions performed in its name rather than 
by AA itself.  That's a huge spectrum of differently motivated people you're 
calling discriminatory there...
