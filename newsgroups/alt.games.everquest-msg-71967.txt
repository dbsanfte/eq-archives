But that's just it.  There isn't any NEED to use XML for this.

There are already pre-existing INI (or even registry) API calls to handle
that kind of stuff.  No need to include an XML parser at all.

Something I've noticed in a lot of places I've worked is that if you give
someone a spiffy new tool, pretty soon they'll start to use it for all kinds
of things, even things that it's really not the best choice for.  But it's a
cool toy and they like playing with it, so that's what gets used...
