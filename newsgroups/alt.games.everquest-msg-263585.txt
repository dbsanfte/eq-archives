I'd like to see someone do the system that was planned for UO2.  Basically
similar to EQ2 and CoH, but debt would decay on its own over time, both
online time AND offline time.  If you were a heavy player, this would make
no difference, as you'd work off the debt before it decayed any significant
amount, but for casual players, it would make a big difference--they would
be able to die, and log out, and have their debt gone by the time they next
got back on.

Also, with that system, if you are just having a bad night combat-wise, you
can step back, and go do qwests or tradeskills for a while, letting some of
the debt work off.
