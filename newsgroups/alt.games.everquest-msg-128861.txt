I have recently gone to FM to the giants fort as a 35 chanter.  I only got
to play a few minutes with a group, but did it not say that they cannot be
mezmerized? WTF?

What then is the strategy for a chanter in a room full of giants - alacrity
the fighters, clarity the real casters, slow/disempower the giants? Can you
charm them (if you were inclined to do so?)
