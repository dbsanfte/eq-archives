I have beaten the ikkinz trials with 1 cleric.. with a paladin.. with a
shaman, all the so called "undesirable" classes who have no chance of
beating the Ikkinz trials...

Compared to somebody like a beastlord, the slowing job is harder to come by
for shamans.. but for healing and slowing, the shaman is in his own.
Cleric+Shaman is enough healing for all 3 trial mobs, including each named.
I don't think the class is really hurting that bad.. their GoD spells at
least are pretty damn good.
