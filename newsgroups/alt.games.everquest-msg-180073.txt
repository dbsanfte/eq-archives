Don't know what this has to do with EQ but...

God's plans don't include making people into robots. We have free will
and my favorite bibical verse is the one that says something like
"time and chance happens to them all." God is not going to control
some female and drop her out of the sky making her attracted to you.
You have to play the game and keep on playing if that is what you
want, God has nothing to do with it. God is not going to make her like
you, tell you she is the one, cause her to get hit by a bus if she
isn't the one, etc. 

Stuff that happens is not "in god's plans" while stuff that doesn't
happen is "not in god's plans." Its called free will. I don't think it
was God's Plan for the greater good that two big buildings fall down,
it was the free will of some people to make a good plan and execute
while not worrying if they died or not. I also don't think its
something God "allowed" to happen because America is immoral. God
doesn't seem to be playing an active part in allowing or not allowing
stuff to happen, though everyone says he is when its something good or
says he didn't when it was something bad.

God hung himself on a cross for you, the only real plan is that you
get that. After that its all choice and free will. In the great scheme
of things a girlfriend means jack crap and don't expect one wrapped up
in a bow.

Finally, never apologize to France ;)
