Reading this, are you under the impression that soloing grizzlies gives more
xp than soloing other mobs of the same level? I hope not. I've heard the
myth before about bears giving more xp. Trust me, it's not true...

Anyway, my ranger and druid both will hunt animals. RP-wise, they hunt for
food and make use of all they can from each kill. They still loathe those
who hunt for sport. IMO, this is very appropriate. I mean, hell, if a druid
would never kill an animal and frowned on the act completely, where do you
think they get their LEATHER ARMOR? ;-p

*Still wonders why wolves and bears are friendly to druids but not
felines...*
