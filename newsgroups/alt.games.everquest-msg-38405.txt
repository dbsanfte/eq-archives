Ah yeah, I read more stuff on it and the EQ caster's realm thing. I
also sent something to Absor on the verant board about confirmation,

beyond the appearance that you are on a horse. I'm trying hard to
believe that verant would find that worth bothering with. The only
bonus I could think of to Verant would be testing horses and things
for this game to really have them in the sequel or such.
