a couple things to try..
when the bells start, just /q out of eq, or camp, and see what programs are
open.
Do you bump your start key shortly before this happens? or do you hit alt or
tab much?
and if you dont wanna put in too much effort you can always disable the bell
sound.. hehe
take a mental note of the last few keys you push before it happens, also, do
you have any virus programs? try shutting them and everything else off, hit
CTRL+ALT+DEL and kill any program that you know what it is that isnt part of
windows, then see if it still happens, then you can have a fun process of
emilination if thats the case....
