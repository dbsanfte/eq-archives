| Hurray sanity at last !
|
| Okay so Sony f****d up on the original release which is daft
| condiderring how long the beta ran for.
|
| But they also did something sensible at last ... they logged who
| handed in what so that they can make the exploiters suffer rather than
| everyone!  WTG Sony !
|
| For all of you who handed in giant snake fangs or bought loads of
| worthless items from the bazaar ... you KNEW that you were using an
| exploit so TOUGH !  Why can't you just PLAY the game and enjoy it
| rather than trying to cheat it???

Have you seen the new values? Everything has been way undercut, many things
far below market value. Everyone that turned in items is going to take a
certain amount of screwing, the amount depends on how much they turned .
