Which is the key to it all - IMO.  It's like a sport.  If you play the
sport with the same people, you get an understanding of how they behave in
certain situations.  You understand not only what you are capable of, but
what your team-mates are too.  You know when to pass the ball, even before
it's obvious, you know when to take a tackle, you know when to do whatever
it takes, before it's obvious, because you're working as a unit.

I know when I can start nuking, not because of some percentage value, but
because I know when the guy who's tanking has aggro, when our Shaman's
gonna slow, how long till the Druid has to cheal, how long our monk is
gonna stay lying on the ground.  I know these things because we've done it
before, a lot, over and over.

I know if the Shaman gets aggro and starts gettin' hit that I'm rooting the
mob, not the druid.  There's no confusion, no conversation, no doubt, no
delay.  Just a root.  I don't need to announce it - the Shaman knows it's
coming, knows how long it'll take to arrive, and knows when to back off
once it's stuck (as one example).

If we get adds, we know who's root parking (or mezzing if our monk is
dressed up as his enchanter), we know which one to kill first, etc., etc.,
etc.

Because we're a team, and we work together to make it work like one.

And that for me is what makes fighting in pickup groups so frustrating, not
because of skill level, hell I suck at this game, but because there's
always some doubt, some confusion, some delay, some duplication.  You can
get a similar level of satisfaction from a pickup group, if people find
they work well together and confidence builds quickly, but there's nothing
like a regular group of friends working together well to give me a feeling
of succeeding at the game.
