Now you've confused me.. you contradict yourself it seems... ?
Does it work with the MOBS or do they see through it?  Like I said, you stay
hidden unless you're attacked by something that can see you... most things
can not see you (at lower levels) however, like I also said, if something
that can usually see through Invis or Camo it will more than likely see you
as well.  HOWEVER if you read the information on the various rogue sites, it
seems to hint that rogue's hiding are often better off than a camo druid
when it comes down to what sees you and what doesn't.
