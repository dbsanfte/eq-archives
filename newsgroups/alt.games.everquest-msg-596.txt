Substitute a Mage for one of your tanks, and have the mage do the
pulling.   The mage pet makes a pretty decent tank on a single
mob, and the mage generally only casts in an overpull if you are
running a meatgrinder... no time to med up from serious burns.

This means that the mage is largely a third wheel; direct pet and
wait for disaster.  Making him puller takes none of the firepower
out of the group insofar as the normal kills goes!  ON overpull, the
mage stays and does his job, if things are well under control, he
runs out and finds the next prey, timing the pull to bring the target
in as you finish up the previous one.

"/pet guard here" is essential, of course

Constant communication is essential.  Mana reports are essential.
Mana conservation is essential.  Doing this right takes a well-oiled
machine...and the rewards are phenomenal.

OUtdoors it is often a fabulous tool... indoors, due to verant's coding
which
does -very- funky things with floors, cielings, and walls, it is often
suicide,
and likely to wipe out not just you but anyone else in the dungeon.
