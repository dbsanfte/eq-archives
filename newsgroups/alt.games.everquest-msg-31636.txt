Tell you what, how about I just cut out the rules that don't deal with
copyright or offensive content, and leave the rest to you as an
exercise...

- Non-fantasy oriented names from popular media. These names can be
either fictional (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader) or non-fictional (e.g. Garth
Brooks, Pierce Brosnan, Ronald Reagan, Michael Jordan).

- Common words and phrases that would not be found in the place and
time setting of the game (e.g. Switchblade, Phaser, Toaster, Cannabis,
Sloegin, Anyone).

- Proper names from EverQuest (e.g. Rathe, Karana). This also includes
the first or last name of any significant EverQuest NPC (e.g. Dorn,
Trumpy, Karn).

- The names of senior Customer Support Representatives or employees of
SOE or Sony Entertainment (e.g. Absor, Abashi, Aradune)

- Names chosen with the intent or possessed with the effect of harming
the reputation of a player or Customer Service Representative. 

- Names containing titles within them, such as, but not limited to:
The, Lord, Lady, Master, King, Knight, Sir, Father (e.g. Sirtallon,
Lordeagle, Mothermaggy, Darksister). 

- Names that contain sentences (Ikillorcs), phrases (Ontop), or two or
more words that do not form descriptive compound words (Petcarbob,
Diediedie and Tablechair). Descriptive compound words are allowed in
first names and are encouraged in surnames (e.g. Treehugger,
Giantslayer). Descriptive compound words (each separate part of the
word and the entire word) must otherwise adhere to all other naming
rules. 

- Names where the combination of the first and last name form a phrase
or violate a previous rule (e.g. Crymea River, Bran Muffin, Story
Thyme) 


>Note: the "immersion"  argument is quite feeble

Since it is a stated reason for the existence of the naming rules, I
would say that this complaint is invalid. In case you missed it:

"Character names in EverQuest should reflect the genre of the game.
Original, high-fantasy names are desired."
