Affirmative action is racist by defnition:
racï¿½ism    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (rszm) n.
1. The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or
ability and that a particular race is superior to others.
2. Discrimination or prejudice based on race.

Fits definition (2) to a tee. (Definitions from
www.dictionary.com, American Heritage Dictionary).

However, that doesn't mean that affirmative action is
necessarily a bad thing. It *does* need to be applied
with care; the idea is to counterbalance that racism
which *isn't* officially sanctioned with that which
*is* (but in the other direction, obviously).

Denying that affirmative action is racist is just silly.
It's necessary, instead, to acknowledge that it's
an attempt at cancelling a greater evil with a lesser one.
Whether the attempt is successful is another matter...

On the whole I think that it's basically a good thing,
but it *does* need to be applied with care, and
with eyes wide open as to possible consequences.
