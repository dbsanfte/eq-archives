Do you actually think before you say something?

He's not running a business, that would imply he's making a profit or
at least that that is the goal. The site is up as a service, and he's
doing what he can to cover the costs. Most people will say, from what
I've seen, that Alla's is one of the best EQ sites out there. However,
web hosting costs money. He's falling behind even with the premium
service funds. People are INCREDIBLY cheap when it comes to websites.
Their heads are stuck up their asses thinking that they shouldn't have
to pay for anything ont he web. So, they'll make do with lesser
service or steal passwords/hack/etc their way into pay sites.

I hate pop-ups, but they are a necissary evil to cover operating costs
when subscriptions don't cut it. It's not a matter of the service not
being good enough, it's a matter of people denying him the funds
needed to keep running.

And, look around. Other EQ sites AREN'T "thriving".

Do try to think about what you're saying rather than spewing crap
simply for the sake of starting an argument next time, will you? The
routine is getting tired.
