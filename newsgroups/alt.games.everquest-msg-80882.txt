The whole stamina issue, (and I mean the yellow bar, not the STA stat,
which CAN be critical in certain things) is pretty hazy and in most
cases useless. From my own reading and experiments, here's what is
known, or at least *thought* to be known about stamina, including boats,
etc.:

When you ride a boat, Verant, for whatever reason, doesn't want you
staying on there, fighting, holding parties, etc. (Why anyone would want
to is a mystery, since the boat code is so freaking buggy.) So if you're
a caster, you can't cast. And if you're a fighter, your stamina gets
sucked out of you while you ride. I don't think it's a bug. It's
intentional.

When you are swimming on the surface, that stamina bar doesn't mean
shit...... ever. (unless of course you are fighting while swimming under
certain circumstances... see below)

If you are swimming under water, your stamina *bar* doesn't really mean
too much, but your STA stat will determine how long you can hold your
breath before you begin to drown. (See Iksars for the exception to this
rule.)

When you are running, AFAIK, your speed does NOT go down when you run
out of the stamina bar, no matter what your STA is. However, you will be
unable to *jump* and in certain places (the ice floes in IC come to
mind) that can be death if you're running from something(s) nasty.

When you are fighting (this applies primarily to melees, of course) it
is said that your attack delay will start to increase, or you'll hit
less often or some bullshit like that if you become fatigued (stamina
bar runs out) *IF* your STA stat is below 100. I've never found a way to
test it, but I hear it enough that I'm willing to accept it as accurate.
If your STA is above 100 you can go on merrily swinging all day with an
empty stamina bar. Believe me on this. I do it on every raid.

I'm sure other folks could add other pertinent and interesting stamina
bar and STA tidbits, but that's the basics as I know them.
