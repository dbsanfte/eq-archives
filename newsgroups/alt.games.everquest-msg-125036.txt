Biz, I'm not going to play your pathetic game. I told you that. Give
it up. You make an obvious snipe by shooting a sarcastic question and
try to backpedal when called on such unwarranted bullshit. The "Here
we go again" bullshit changed it from a "simple question" to a direct
jab and you damn well know it.

Goodbye. I'm done with you on this line. Find someone else to harass.
