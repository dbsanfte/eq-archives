The main thing?  Whichever one bores you the least.

Secondary, NOT jewel craft, tinkering, poison making or alchemy.  Those are
all class or race specific (either in fact or in reality).

With few exceptions trade skills won't turn a profit...you do it as
something to kill time or to have fun when you don't feel like doing hack
'n' slash.
