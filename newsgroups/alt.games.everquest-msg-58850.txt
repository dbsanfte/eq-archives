This is a little bit like the tactic you use in a lot of RTS games, where
instead of just throwing all your men into the middle of the battlefield to
attack whomever they wish (though I know many who use this tactic :-) ), you
concentrate all the attacks of your men on a single unit of the enemy at a
time.  For a bit of trivia works extremely well with Longbowman in AoK :-).
Essentially it is all about battle efficiency.  20 arrows hitting a Paladin
at once means that he will never touch the longbowman, and probably the next
Paladin won't either,a and maybe the next after that :-).
