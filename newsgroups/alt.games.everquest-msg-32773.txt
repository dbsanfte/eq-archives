    He admitted to KSing?
    this becomes real easy (at the time... useless now)
    /report
    /petition ksingasshole intentionally kill stole a rare spawn after I had
engaged it, and admitted to it, as I have /reported.

Well, shit!

Had I known that KSing is totally acceptable, I would have my effing JBoots
now.

I could have EASILY taken the ac from the group that had him last night...
stupid me, just assumed that since I know this is a petitionable offense,
and a violation of the PNP, I let the guys I knew had it aggroed have it.

After all, it still looked like it had full health... and it was just
standing there... and there was a /ooc that it was taken... by the guy who
was standing next to it... kinda just like this case.
