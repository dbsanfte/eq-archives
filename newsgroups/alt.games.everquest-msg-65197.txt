Actually they are legally bound to have to support what they
advertise.  The other day I went to buy a DVD and the store had an
old price on the shelf from a previous sale they had.  I got the
movie at that cheaper price because they have to honor what they
advertise.  That is the law.  I know many here suckle at the teat of
their great mother Sony and there for will never fault them for
anything.  But Sony has to honor what they put on the box or suffer
legal ramifications.  But with the money they pull in every month
they likely don't care.

All that being said if I had win 95 I would just go buy an upgrade
for my OS or return EQ if purchased less than a month ago and not
wory about it.  It is only a damn game after all.
