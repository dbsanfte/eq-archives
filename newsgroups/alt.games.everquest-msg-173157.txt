I was hooked from hour one too - and there wasn't near as much content
the day after release as now :-P 

While it was tremendously harder to advance then, that was offset by the
fact that everything was new.  

When I got to level 6 and had my drum to use on Selo's, I roamed far and
away from home :)  I was able to go to Innothule and buy netted gloves
from the trolls for 1pp and sell them to high (10th!) level monks who
wanted to hunt wisps for 10pp or more.

Those runs allowed me to buy my first magic weapon - a Tentacle whip
(the 4/25 one that procs lifetap).
