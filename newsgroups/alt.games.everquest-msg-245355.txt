SWG was a success and a failure for me, and I quit playing, although if EQ1
folds and SWG is an option, I'll go back and have a look.

To me the most annoying thing was micromanagement. A solar power generator
had to be continually adjusted because the type of power it produced was
deemed to alter constantly and you had to turn it off and reset it every
day, basically. Maybe it was running windows :*)

I liked the semi-permanent structures, but to me, continual maintenance
payments are boring. I you are paying your acct, you should have a certain
amount of 'real estate' reserved for you. If you lapse payment, then having
the items go back to deeds would be ok, or even losing the items, but to get
sick or suffer outages (which can last for weeks) and come back to find
everything you had built was gone, despite continuous payments from your
credit card, is heart wrenching, and I fear EQ2 will use the same scheme.

Tradeskilling was the best thing about SWG. I often look at everquest's
tradeskilling and wish it were more like SWG. Instead of having the market
flooded with cheap skillups, the skillup items were more often converted to
pure xp. In EQ terms, the tradeskillers would be able to make the best
armour and weaponry and even make you a palace... and often produce items
offline.

The graphics were great. The dancing has to be seen to be  believed. Combat
was a bit dull, and the system tended to make it so that wookies didn't use
bowcasters, and a beastlord type character was (at the time i left)
extremely powerful (and kind of weird and un star wars).

 Everquest may have broken or obsolete quests but there's a hell of a lot of
character to it all. I think it's a shame they don't update old world
graphics more, allow for religion changes (most people play as agnostics,
and I think killing your god should automatically qualify!), give more
faction hits (and let you see the numerical value of your factions) on
beasts so that an iksar can be 'redeemed', or a human walk the haunted
streets of cabilis (the old bone chip method was nerfed and was painful at
the best of times)... there's so many things I think they could do, but
won't because at the high end game noone goes to cities except the ones in
the latest expansion, where there's a multi-racial mix anyway.
