Actually I'd say you can't have it both ways. Getting skill high
enough to make backpacks is pretty darn easy. If you are going to SELL
the backpack for 100 plat, you should be willing to BUY the skin for
50 plat. Buying the skin for 20 or 25 plat is FINE if you then sell
the pack for 50 plat. When you try to gouge people by buying skins for
25 plat for a combine, at a skill that is easy to get, then sell the
pack for 100 plat they kind of frown on that.

For one thing tailor made backpacks are totally worthless when I even
made the trip with a level 6 newb char to buy gnome toolboxes, with
money I made myself. The 10 percent weight deduction is more or less
useless. I can't figure out why someone would even pay 20 plat for a
tailored backpack now. I'm a tailor and I don't even find it worth my
time to make backpacks now, or to try to sell them. I've got them in
every twinks bank slots and that is enough (with some deluxe sewing
kits to hold GIANT items.. if there were any ever) Instead I make much
better use of high quality bear hides:

My twinks save them for when they want to auction for a teleport or a
wolf form or something for faction getting, works better than hundreds
of plat to encourage someone ;) The other thing which works great is
60 bone chips, for "faction raising." My twinks own druids ;)
