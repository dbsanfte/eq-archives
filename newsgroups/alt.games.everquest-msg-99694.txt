I'm in a parallel situation.  My 35 monk primarily soloes.  But sometimes my
wife wants to group her 24 cleric with me.

Everything I fight is red to her.  I can solo them all just fine and take
all the exp for myself.  But I love it when she groups, and not just because
I enjoy playing with my wife.

The EXP flows so much faster with a healer that it's not funny.  Normally I
have some downtime between kills while I bandage up and mend.  With her
around, there is no downtime - it's just continuous killing.

So don't worry about who's sucking exp from who - you're both profiting a
lot more from the pairing than either of you would seperately.
