I didn't say Warriors fast aggro was poor, just that Knights are
still better at it.

On single pulls my baby Warrior has the same success,  glad to hear
it's true at high level as well.

Compared to the old days, yes.  But the difference between a skilled
Warrior and a clown is still huge if you're doing anything more than
just the safest most boring XP camp you can find.

One other thing:  Warriors remain more dependant on their groupmate's
competence than Knights, which definitely adds irony to having all
these half-competent DPS and support toons demanding over-geared
Warriors to compensate for their own inadequacies.  A lot of the XP
groups at my level are an absurdly inefficient waste of the tank's
time, the tank typically being higher level and much better geared
than the rest of the group (rarely there will be a higher level
Cleric and/or Enchanter instead).
