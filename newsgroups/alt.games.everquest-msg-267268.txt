Well, if you have it, then it may be useful in the caves. I'm playing a 
fighter, and the last time I went into the caves I was around Lvl8 and 
found myself running away a lot...

No. You automatically get new skills. However, you can then buy 
'upgrades' to these, and also get them from other players who make them, 
and as rare drops.

For example, I got 'Wild Swing' at an early level, and it comes at 
Apprentice 1 level (all arrive as that). I then purchased upgrades for 
it (and others) to Apprentice 2. I think you need crafters to get you 
Apprentice 3 but I'm not sure. You can then (through differing means) go 
up through Adept 1-3 and Master.

Np. I'm very new to all this, but finding it pretty straightforward by 
playing in game, and asking a few questions OOC. There's already several 
sites offering swathes of information, but I tend to avoid them as I 
don't want spoilers. The Newbie Yard on the official forums, along with 
the specifice forums, can be very useful.
