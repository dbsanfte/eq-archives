Rings don't appear on a keyring, keys do...

If the ring happens to be a key, and you have used it once to put it on 
your keyring, then, yes, you can destroy it.

That is a flag, not a key.

The way the keyring works is that any key that actually goes on the 
keyring (not all do), will be put there automatically, when you use it to 
open the door/zone into the zone that the key is for.  After it is on 
your keyring, you can delete the key.  You will get a message that it has 
been added to your keyring, and you can see which keys are on it by using 
the /keyring command.
