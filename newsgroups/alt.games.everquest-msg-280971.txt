Everquest:

EverQuest Ultimate Ban Secrets added 10 new obvious methods for making sure
you never access the characters on your account again.

> Gate Plugin: Instantly gate to your current bind location no matter what
your class. With this plug-in you will never die again.

Yeah, they're called gate potions. Shammies make them.  Or spells.  Pure
casters get them.  Or the Origin AA ability.  Don't know how it makes you
invulnerable to dying.

> Instant-Zone: Instantly move yourself to any adjacent zone. Never waste
time traveling again.

It's called walking.  Most bipedal sentient beings figure this one out
pretty young.

> No-Stun: Never be stunned again.

Make an ogre character.

> Jump: Allows you to jump with 0 endurance

[Spacebar]

> Infravision: Weak human eyes? See like a dark elf.

Go buy a dark elf illusion potion.  Rogues and bards can get a mask.
Enchanters get a spell.
