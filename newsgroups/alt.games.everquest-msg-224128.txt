Well, this problem, for me and one guildmate anyway is no longer an
issue.

I was contacted last night by the Lead GM that I had been dealing
with. She told me she had done some research and would like to help
me. I was told of a quest involving Solomen in the Temple Of Solusek
Ro in Lavastorm that, once done would fix the faction problem.

For me, this was not an option as the original GM had reset my faction
to base. All she could do was complete the quest for me. But my
guildmate was refunded her tear and told she needed to deal with the
npc. We ran up there and she did the quest. Well, to make a long story
short, she got the 'can't get any better' faction message again, so we
figured that obviously something was still not right. We ran a group
down to CoM, spawned Rak, she turned in the tear, same thing. He won't
talk to her. GM is petitioned and in about 30 minutes, my guildmate
had her epic as well.

I would like to note that for an experiment, another guildie killed
Solomen to see what it would do and his True Spirit Faction went down.
So, in fairness, perhaps by 'dealing with the NPC' she actually meant
to kill him? I can't confirm. All I can say is that another shaman
with max ally faction did the tear turnin and failed, although as
stated, we both recieved our Epics.

I will be very interested to see if news of this 'quest' being
involved witht the shaman epic faction issue is actually publicized.
The GM told me it was discussed in their forums, but I was unable to
find where.

Thank you, all who supported me on this issue and thank you GM
Solanafinn for your help with finally completing our Epics.

I only wish now that by me getting through this I had some advice to
others wondering if they are in the same boat, including several more
in my guild.  Unfortunately I'm still as stumped as I was in the
beginnning.   =/

Side note:  Group was (2) 65 Shaman, 65 Cleric, 65 Druid, 65 Paladin,
and a Rogue alt which I'm too lazy to look up his level.  Fire AoE was
a pain as usual, but he went down quickly and no deaths.  The cleric
even stepped in to Melee for a bit because he was bored just standing
there, heh.  I cast Blood Of Saryrn twice with no resists although it
annoyed him enough to summon me =)
