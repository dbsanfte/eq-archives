Interesting. I hate drive by healing being possible. It trivializes the 
game and rapidly turns it into a PL fest. I want encounters that are 
challenging, I want defeating those encounters to be a reflection of the 
fact that the group acted capably.

I do not want to mow down mobs with a max-level healer yawing in the 
background making it impossible for anyone in the fight to do. Why 
bother even playing.

Don't get me wrong, I know you've only defended drive by niceness, not 
systematic PLing... but the mechanic that allows for one allows for the 
other too.

Further... does the guy who heals you in CoH derive any benefit 
whatsoever? Is he awarded xp and influence for his action? If he's not, 
its pretty much irrelevant to the KS discussion at hand.
