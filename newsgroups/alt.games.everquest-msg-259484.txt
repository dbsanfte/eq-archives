Sort of a long post....


So I was in DSP with my 51 necro heading to GE.  I see this other necro, who
conned green, running in front of me.  I thought he was probably going to
the ME or GE entrance to fight tribals.  Anyways, he gets attacked by a
shroom and I notice that there is a wolf dangerously close to him.  He's
soloing the shroom, so naturally I think he doesn't notice the wolf.  Like
any high level character would do, I start killing the wolf that I *think*
is about to kill this necro.  As soon as my pet says "taunting attacker,
master" i see that the wolf turns towords my pet, but doesn't run up and
attack.  So the wolf is obviously rooted, but I seem to remember wolves
being extremely hard to solo (even as a necro) back when I was fighting in
DSP, so I decide to kill it anyway, because if I didn't this lower level
necro would probably have run or FD'd after the shroom was dead.  SO....then
the shroom he is fighting dies and his pet goes to attack the wolf.  I'm now
a little confused whether or not I should help this guy (after all, he's
obviously not a high enough level to hunt in GE or ME, and at the levels
when DSP is good XP you are far below the wolf's level).  I call my pet
back, hoping this guy doesn't think I'm KSing.  The wolf goes down and I run
over to the other necro to say "Sorry for KSing."  Now, I don't know if the
shrooms in that zone can pop out of nowhere like the wolves or if I just
didn't notice these ones, but I find that I have 3 shrooms on me!  It didn't
take them long to start attacking the lower level, so I root and sick my pet
on them and see him back off.  I notice that one of the shrooms is dark
blue, so I root, snare, poison, and splurt, assuming that the other 2 are
greens and my pet can take them.  The shroom I'm soloing goes down quickly,
so I go to help my pet, who is getting rather low on health.  I notice there
is ANOTHER dark blue shroom (which was surprising cuz I didn't think there
were any dark blues in DSP at 51, maybe the stonegrabbers, but they're
indifferent so I've never taken the time to actually con one and find out).
I quickly realize that that is why my pet is so low on health so I root the
DB and call back my pet.  Green shroom follows pet, sick pet on green
shroom, that's taken care of.  While my pet pet beats the hell out of the
green shroom I poison the DB shroom (I hadn't used my level 49 pet for this
kind of stuff much, so I was surprised that he was able to get the shroom
down to 30% on his own).  It's a pretty good DoT, so I figure that shroom's
as good as dead.  On to the green one.  Sadly, my pet was so low on health
that he only got the green one down to 50% before he died.  I root it,
lifetap, and am OOM!  Crap!  Quickly get lich up and med for a few seconds
(go necro regen!) then I have enough to lifetap one more time.  3 shrooms
down.  The whole battle took like 3-5 minute probably.  By this time that
low level necro must think I'm the biggest asshole in the world, so I want
to appologize, but he's gone.  I search through my spam box to see if I can
find a "so-and-so begins to cast a spell" messege, but all I see is his pet
tanking messeges.  So now I can't send this guy a tell.  I just /shout,
explaining what happened (both so I wouldn't get any "don't KS" tells, and
so the necro would know it was him I was talking to) and saying I'm sorry
for KSing and training him.  Zoned out immediately because it was dinner
time, so didn't hear if there was a shout back.  I didn't recieve any tells
either.

If you're still reading, good for you!  You made it to my question!  Did I
do something wrong here or was this just a bunch of unfortunate coincidences
that ended up making me look bad?  After all, I was only trying to save him
from being attacked by a wolf.  Wouldn't anyone save a lower level character
from something they didn't think they could kill?  I just hope he heard the
shout and doesn't report me or anything....
