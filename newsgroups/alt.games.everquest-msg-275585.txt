 Tradeskill experience gain has been doubled for the weekend! French and
German servers will receive the same bonus XP next week.
- Crafted products will now sell back to NPC vendors for the cost it took to
produce them. This value is stored on each item, so two of the same item may
sell back for different values depending on the cost of production of each.
If you bought components from an NPC merchant, the merchant cost will be
used as the component's value. Please note that this value does not take
into account any profit made by other players selling components used to
make the finished item, only the manufacturing cost of the item itself.
- NOTE: The new sellback pricing only applies to items created after this
update went live. Unfortunately we cannot retroactively calculate the
production costs of items that were made before this update.
