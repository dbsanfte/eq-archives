Why yes I have, and it's far from an "animal" disease as there is an
equivalent malady suffered by humans.  I actually know a woman who suffered
from the human version.

I had a puppy get hit by a car once when I was a little kid.  I guess I
should have had its legs removed based on that logic.

Or, to put it another way, that woman didn't start a mandatory uterus
removal campaign because she realized that...  wait for it...

Life happens.

Let me know if you ever intend to make an actual point and I'll plan on
addressing it.
