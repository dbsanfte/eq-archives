Look Call us what ever names you want, your going in my kill file after
this anyways, Just because you have become bored with and no longer
enjoy the game, doesn't mean that others don't still enjoy it.  Plain
and simple, you don't like it don't play it, we don't need to see your
idiotic rant here.
