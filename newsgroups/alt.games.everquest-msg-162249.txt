Tyger...  Try one again.  The new gereration of RF cordles opticals is
outstanding.  The 1.0 versions were very flighty, espesialy when they got
just a little drained..  I bought the logitech cordless desktop when it
first came out.  The mouse was jumpy when the  battery indicater had just
hit low...  I was told there shouldn't be any degridation until it said
Critical, so I tried moving the pickup around a couple of times, but that
didn't  work.  Finaly i told them that new bateries where only lasting about
3 weeks with reliable results, and they sent me out one of the newest
versions..   Much much better.  The new mouse last's about 3-4 months on my
nicad recargeables(1800 amp/hour) i got for a profesional level remote
control.  That is about what should be expected with a good alkali batery as
well with some taper towards the end of its life. (alkalies put out a very
constant amp output, untill they loose about .5 volts, then they go down
hill very fast)

If you where interested in a cordless optical the new Logitech MX700
Coerdless Optical Mouse reseaved a Kick Ass award from MaximumPC..
(something they said last year that they could never see a cordless mouse
gettting)  It has its own recharging cradle.  Standerd Left, Right And
center/Scroll wheel.  It also has 5 aditional butons.  two above the thumb
rest on the left side, and three in line with the scroll wheel, one above
and two below.

Hope this info is of use to some people.

As a last note....  ALWAYS CHECK YOUR POWER LEVEL.  it sucks to get into
that 30 minute fight and not have any mouse because you have to go to the
mouse properties to update the battery.

Omiin.
