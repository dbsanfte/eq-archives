No, but you could also try ICSconfig and the associated Everquest config
file, available from www.practicallynetworked.com - they're a pretty
reliable source. The program is a generic ICS utility, not specific to
EQ, and the config file is just a couple of lines of text listing EQ's
required UDP ports. I'd doubt very much that it was written in order to
steal EQ passwords etc, in fact I doubt the author even plays EQ, and
I've seen no odd activity through Zonealarm while using it.
