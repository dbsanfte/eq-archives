Pentium 4's do not mean you need RDRAM.
MOST P4 systems use SDR and/or DDR memory.

Only people who went out of their way to buy i850 chipset boards will
have to buy RDRAM.

RDRAM was priced even HIGHER than it is now.
You didn't think buying a motherboard that specifically required RDRAM
was a stupid move when you bought it given the more than 5x price
RDRAMs were just a few months ago?
