Would you rather lose a character for good that you put months or even
years into playing? This ain't D&D. Death is a LOT more likely.

Besides, the whole death not being for good thing is a standard in
CRPGs. Even in D&D, though, a dead character can be brought back...

Welcome to the wonderful world of CRPGs.

Interaction with other people, perhaps? If you want roleplay, find a
group of people who roleplay. There are whole guilds dedicated to
roleplay on some servers. If you want something to do that's not
mindless killing, look into tradeskills (though, you'll need tons of
cash to get them high, which is acquired mainly through hunting).

The thing that makes the game isn't the game itself, it's the fact
that there are so many other players to interact with.
