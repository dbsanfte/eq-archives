  That's true, but most of the platinum sinks he mentioned aren't huge
sources of player revenue anyway.  Very seldom do you see a character
offering to pay to be healed.  Sometimes you will see people paying
for SoW/Breeze/Clarity, but I think there are few people out there who
really make a substantial profit.

  Getting rid of money (and/or equipment) is really one of the key
aspects that's necessary for a balanced game economy of any sort that
does not begin to suffer from Monty Haul syndrome.  There needs to be
a drain on the economy or else it eventually becomes a balance issue.
If you have money and equipment constantly flowing in to the system,
but little or no way for that equipment/cash to removed from the
system, what eventually happens is that the "overall standard of
living" for players keeps going up and up... and inflation.  If money
and equipment simply changes hands and isn't removed from the system,
more and more it becomes common for people at lower levels to have
nicer gear, and for people at higher levels to have excellent/uber
gear.

  This can be viewed as a major problem.  If characters keep on
getting more and more powerful as the availability of better gear gets
better, then areas and mobs which were formerly a suitable challenge
for a character of Level X, no longer are.  This leaves Verant with
two fundamental choices: watch some of the challenges of the game
evaporate, or continually make mobs tougher, or do nerfs.

  Not really.  As long as there is a continual flow of items and
platinum in to the game and as long as gear continues to play a key
role in a character's effectiveness, there will always be a player
driven market for such items.  The prices may go down, yes, but that
is not in and of itself a terrible thing.
