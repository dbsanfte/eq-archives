I've never been so excited than when I got an unexpected drop in the beach
on gunthak (I was gathering finger bones for that ring quest)...a
sharpened jetsam I think it was. That 2 by 4 with nails stuck in it, 30/35
2hb for monk/beastlords.  My beastlord is something I always thought of as
being a real grouchy, bruiser of a girl, so when she picked that thing up
I *knew* she'd found the right weapon for her.  and, well, whilst 30/35 is
fairly good for a beastlord in her low/mid levels, it won't hold her if
she starts to get into her 50s. Because H2H has a higher cap, I assume
that a 2hb would have to be *really good* to be worthwile (ie, really slow
to avoid riposts, because DAMN those H2H weapons have scary
ratios...unlike my rangers DW, a beastlord's DW probably is still superior
to 2handing...based on both itemization and skill caps).

So, anyhow, anyone know of any weapons besides the one from gunthak beach
that has that graphic? I'm assuming it would come from nadox or hate's
fury. I'd check myself in Allakhazam, but, hrm, I haven't paid for a
subscription.
