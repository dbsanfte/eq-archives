In the end, even those with 41% haste on an epic end up bagging it.   The
base ratios on the weapons stay the same, and at the end of the day, they
are still Kunark era weapons.   As you start getting into Velious and Luclin
level raiding, it becomes relatively easy (1) to move your max haste to
another slot, at which point that 16 damage 19 delay plus an assload of
stats dagger looks *much* better offhand than your old 15 damage 25 delay
Ragebringer.


(1) - Well, it's never easy, and it's often costly, in terms of platinum or
DKP.  But haste items drop often enough that every raider should be equipped
with 36%+ haste in an off slot relatively painlessly after a few months.
