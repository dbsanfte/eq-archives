Hehe As a street racer back in the 70s I can tell you that my 69 Chevelle was a
real sleeper. Stock look and even had the original 307 emblems on the fenders.
BUT under the hood sported a 390 HP 427 with square port big valve heads,
Eldebrock torker intake with a holley 1100 double pumper carb, roller cam and
rockers, turbo 400 transmission,1 1/8" headers with 3" dual exhaust, a 4.11 12
bolt positrack rear end, with 4 point solid bushing suspension.

Yes I did get a little perturbed when they wanted to look under the car on under
the hood. After I had won the race and took their money THEN I would let them
look.

Hehe


My best friend had a 68 GTO with a 400 with 389 heads which was good for a 13 to
1 compression, 6 pack intake, Block had been blue printed balanced and built
with aluminum rods. Ran the street like that.


So your comparison lacks a little.
