Call me Mr Hard-to-please :o)

okay... I like the fact that the 'baby fear' lands... whereas before it
almost never landed, or faded almost immeadiately.
It's just that I'd like to see more of a 'middle ground' approach. I've
never claimed to be much good as a Necro... but now even I can cruise thru
by soloing at least yellows

Nowadays I have the following on my latest baby Necro... built and twinked
from the ground up, especially to take advantage of spell effects

Best Pet for level... guaranteed
Cheaper Pets (Reanimation Efficiency II, Plat Skull Ring)
Faster casting Pets (Reanimation Haste II, Robe of Enshroudment)
Longer lasting DoTs (Extended Affliction II, Serp Bracer)
Cheaper DoTs (Affliction Efficiency II, Grey Flesh Gloves)
More chance to land a spell, thanks to Resists changes
I'm still looking for Affliction Haste II or III to upgrade my Ring of
Goblin Lords :o)

... and all these are in the last few months.

Were melee characters THAT much more powerful than casters?
