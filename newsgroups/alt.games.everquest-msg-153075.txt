There's no 'some sources' about it.  That's what heathen means.  And as you
say, 'pagan' is from 'pagani' meaning 'country dwellers'.

Both terms were used in a derogatory manner in the Roman Empire to describe
those backwards rural folk who hadn't yet caught up with the people at the
bustling hub of the Empire in adopting the new religion of Christianity.
