They're up to 2100 now, and it's a significant price difference.  That's 
why I went with the 2000.

I built the entire thing for about $1200.  It would have been $100 cheaper 
had I been able to get the ECS mbs working.  Knowing what I know now, I 
suspect you could do the entire thing for $1100 as I have it spec'd out.
Going with the ti4400 vs. ti4600 saved me about $100 for a very minor 
performance degredation.  Again, one step below absolute best seems to be 
best value.
