You can wet your feet in PoJ - the easiest of the planes and very
do-able with a small group in low 50s. While not the best of xp
compared to other planes, still a helluva lot better than any other
50ish zone. Pickup groups are very common here (on CT server anyways).
None of the mobs near the zone out summon (that i have noticed anyways
in the many hours of hunting here) and they dont hit like most planar
mobs (ie fast and hard). You dont even need a shammy/chanter to slow
altho still nice to have. Pickup groups are still possible tho in any
Tier 1 plane - ive jumped into groups in PoD and PoI as well, but
these are harder than PoJ. Loot however pretty much sucks in PoJ
though. Youll get a rare diamond off of a sentry, and a few other odd
ball things on rare occasions, but thats about it.
