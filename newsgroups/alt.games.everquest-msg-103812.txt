Well, after way too long, and way too much work, I finally have my new 
computer up and working.  I got the OS up about 11pm last night and 
immediately started FTPing my EQ directory over.  I probably should have 
moved all my screenshots to another directory, but I wasn't really 
thinking at that point.  Anyway, got everything moved, could get EQ to 
load, but kept getting disconnected at character select screen.  
Downloaded the reference drivers from nVidia, installed, rebooted, tried 
again, and WOW!  I don't think I've been able to play video lag-free since 
Kunark was released.  
This is what EverQuest is supposed to look like.
I was in Kael, so I immediately zoned out into Wakening Lands, which had 
always been a terrible zone for me.  Hmmm, everything looked great.  I 
turned sky back on (double-layer even!), spell effects back on, particle 
effects to high, and clip plane all the way out.  Started running through 
zone, no lag at all.  I then moved the resolution up to 1600x1200, still 
no lag.
Zoned back into Kael, no raids, only single groups exp/faction-grinding, 
so no real test, but still no lag.  Ran through EW & GD to Velks, noticing 
how pretty everything looks.  Zoned into Velks, 40 in the zone, all 
grinding.  I was able to stand on the ramps and see 3 groups fighting at 
once, with all spell effects, plus my AE manasong hitting everyone, still 
no lag.  I'll do further test tonight, but I think I am finally going to 
be able to actually see what I'm fighting.  OMG weeeeeeeeeee!

Here are my system specs.

Network	DLink 10/100

OS:
WinXP Professional

Current Issues:
Music poor-have Turtle Beach Card to test with
No registered DVD player software yet
Need to move all my preferred apps over

Issues with the install:
2 bad CPU/MB combinations--RMAs in progress
Memory a bit difficult to get installed and recognized 
Video card restricts access to lowest drive bay

Really, really nifty feature of MB:
ASUS POST reporter voice status reporting.  If you plug speakers into the 
on-board audio, the BIOS test will tell any errors, ie 'System failed 
memory test.  System failed memory test', 'System failed VGA test.  System 
failed VGA test', and 'Self-test completed, booting operating system'.
