Dear gamers. The Guild of Blades has a problem. We have too many games
and our warehouse is getting full. We need to free up some shelf space
to make room for our upcoming productions. Our options are to get a
bigger warehouse or have a sale. We're chosing the sale. As such, we're
offering you some great deals on a number of select titles.

Come stop by the Guild's invetory reduction sale web page at
http://www.guildofblades.com/sale.html and see what we have available.

While there you can also check out our stock of out of print game
titles. You can get a great deal on some older, discontinued Guild of
Blades products while quantities last.
http://www.guildofblades.com/clearance.html

Sale available for a limited time only and subject to product
availability.

Thanks,
Ryan S. Johnson
Guild of Blades Publishing Group
