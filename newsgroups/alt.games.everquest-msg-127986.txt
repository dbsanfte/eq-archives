54 isn't too bad.  It's worse than 53, sure, but I'm 4 yellow through it in
3 weeks, and should finish it this week, and that's including spending 2
days on my PotC earring, should make it to 55 (whee, bear pet) either
tomorrow or next week (when I next get on).

3 people (for me it was 54 druid (me), 54 warrior, 57 mage) in their low-mid
50's in Kedge near Undertow's room can keep the temple and the seahorse
caves.  The exp bonus in Kedge is insane, I got 4 blue in about 3 hours
there, then after we left, I got another blue in 90 minutes, WITH KEI, doing
Tro Jeg in SD.
