So that's all expansions, right?  Here's what I suggest.  Copy the 
everquest directory to the new machine.  That'll save you having to 
install, patch, copy settings, etc.  Now you have EQ on two machines and 
you can play your existing account on either one of them (but not both 
at the same time.)

To be able to play on two machines at once, you need two accounts, just 
as if you were two separate people.  So get yourself to the store and 
buy enough CDs to get you the pieces you want on the second account. 
Perhaps EQ Gold would do if you also activate LoY online.  You do NOT 
have to install the CDs at all, just enter the CD keys in to activate 
the new account.  This will give you a second account, with no 
characters on it.  You can create new characters and PL them using your 
primary account.  Now you have two accounts, and you can play either 
account on either computer.

In theory it is possible to get characters transferred from one account 
to another if they have the same billing information, so if you think 
you might want to do that, read up on it on SOE's web site before you 
enter your credit card information.  I believe there's a fee, like $50 
or something.

The method I described preserves logs and UI settings, though if you 
want them to continue to be the same you'll have to make any new changes 
on both systems of course.

I haven't done this in the last few years, but you used to be able to 
just copy the .ini file with one character's name into the .ini file 
with the other character's name.  Hopefully someone will be able to give 
better information.
