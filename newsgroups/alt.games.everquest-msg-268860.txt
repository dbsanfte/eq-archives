Hmm, I tried everywhere I could on the shelves, but no go--I ended up 
putting it on the windowsill, I think.  Or maybe it was the table.  Anyway, 
I haven't been back to the room since the first "day", and so far haven't 
discerned any particular reason I need to.

Is there one?  A reason to use your room, that is?
