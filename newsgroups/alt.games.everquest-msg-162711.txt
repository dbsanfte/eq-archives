Now stop a second and think about it.  What if you'd been trying
to kill mobs during that span?  Can you imagine the fizzles, the
resists, the wipeouts, and the corpse runs?  Be glad you were
just making cheapo smithing goods!  :)  The RNG is part of the
game environment.  Do you really want all of your results to be
so boringly predictable?  The possibility of horrible results is
side-by-side with the possibility of wonderful results.  Although,
If you prefer to look on the dark side of everything, you can be
bit on the ass by good results too, if you mistakenly assume that
it really is that easy to do something and head out confidently
to do battle with inadequate forces, or end up with egg on your
face from having promised friends glory only to deliver ignominy.
But hey, that's EQ:  die and learn.  :-p
