You really need to learn the difference between a dark fantasy and an
idealistic fantasy. Most RPGs are dark fantasy... The world is far
from perfect, sometimes even farther from it than the real world.
Racial hostilities run violent as common accepted practice.

Also note that the stereotypes in a fantasy setting are the almost
always true. Exceptions are an extreme rarity. The prejudices in a
fantasy world are well justified.

This ain't Barney, kid. No, we can't all "just get along". What would
be the fun of RPing a world where everyone loved each other?
