Actually, acceptability is an opinion unto itself. Obviously you find
certain ideas and methods acceptable, whereas I do not. 

But I don't mind backing my opinion up...

My assertion of "price gouging" being an unacceptable form of business
practice is based on a foundation of well established legal precedents
and  philosophical arguments.

 If I wish to become the owner of some (owned) good, I must offer the
owner of that good a sufficient amount of other property that I own to
persuade him to part with his property. 

In other words, I must offer him something he prefers more to the
property he currently owns. While in principle I could offer him just
about anything (as in the case of barter), on the free market
exchanges take place in terms of money property, with the value of
money property being derived from the effort I've placed in obtaining
it. 

("I'll carry 100lbs of potatoes for you, if you carry 100lbs of
tomatoes for me" would be an equal (if pointless) exchange)

 Such indirect exchange avoids the problems of an absence of a double
coincidence of wants, and the exchange ratios in  terms of money
property are what prices are.

In the case of consumer goods, an exchange takes place based on a
direct comparison of utility.  To become such owners, they must meet
the requirements of the current owners of the goods in question.

The real question we're debating is whether the price paid is equal to
the effort involved to obtain enough property to exchange. 

If it takes me 5 minutes to farm a low quality cat pelt, then its
obviously unfair to expect you to part with plat that values in excess
of my 5 minute invested effort . 

("I'll carry 10lbs of potatoes for you if you carry 25lbs of tomatoes
for me.")
