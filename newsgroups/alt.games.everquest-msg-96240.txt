Hmmm....wonder if they will do something for higher levels in this
direction?  What might be good would be to make it work as follows
at higher levels:

1. When you die, you leave a corpse with your equipment, like now,
and have 3 hours to get an XP res.

2. When the res timer expires, the corpse moves to a safe spot in
the zone.

3. Add a command "/summoncorpse", which can be used to summon a
corpse to the safe spot, but which removes any remaining time on the res
timer.

This would keep the need for corpse recovery if you wanted a res, and
keep the penalty of having to travel to the zone you died in to get your
stuff back, but would eliminate the risk of losing your corpse, and
eliminate the need to get a corpse *just* to get your stuff back.

Along with the new res spells for lower level clerics, this is a good
sign that Verant has realized that EQ has *way* more downtime than is
necessary.  I don't know if they came to their senses on their own, or
if they noticed that certain other games are doing fine with much less
downtime, but whatever the reason, it is welcome.

I predict we'll see more changes to cater to the casual player.
(Downtime is a big detriment to casual play).  I think what we are going
to see over the next few months and beyond is the rise of the multi-game
player.  People aren't going to be as willing to devote long blocks of
time to one game.
