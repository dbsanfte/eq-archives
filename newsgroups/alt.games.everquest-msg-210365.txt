Nope, they don't.

Reason for this is that in addition to being a DOT, the Choke line also has a
STR debuff component, and same line debuffs don't stack (if they did you could
find ten chanters and get a mob's str down to zero... which if stats really
mattered would be astonishingly effective)

I've only seen a couple people excited about the str debuff portion of the
choke line, and I'd think a simple solution would be to remove it from the DOT,
so chanters could stack their own DOTs on, or stack DOTs with other chanters.
But since chanter DOTs are generally fairly inefficient and tiny, there's no
real movement out there pushing for this improvement.
