}Voodoo 3 and 5 are now shown as supported cards for the upgrade.

And, in fact, my Voodoo 3 2000 16MB actually works!  Yay!

I'm running it with 512MB PC100 Ram and a Duron 800 on an Asus MB. 
Win98 (not SE).

I was able to get the game running with all character models.  I had to 
turn off facial expressions, dynamic lighting, and set texture quality to 
low.  Its was very laggy in places, but bringing in the clipping plane to 
about 1/3 of the way out helped considerably.

I was unable to download the new Voodoo 3/9x driver from the heavily 
impacted sony server, so I got the same filename from voodoofiles.com.

I did experience one direct crash to desktop, and a couple of blue screens 
of death when trying to start the game...  But it was nowhere near as bad 
as I thought it would be. :)

Still can't wait for my Geforce 2 Pro to get here late this wek. :)
