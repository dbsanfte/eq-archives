No when they lowered the price at the same time they increased the
content. Has nothing to do with difficulty because that's not
something Joe Q public can judge from a box. They certainly can say to
themselves however "Hey I've seen this game on the shelves for a year
now, and its price has dropped and hey look there's 50% more playing
area and a new race. Hmmm maybe nows a good time to pick it up."

Blizzard sells well because they have a rep for quality and fun.
Diablo 2 IMHO is the first game from them that hasn't lived up to the
fun factor they always delivered before. I think they took way to many
lessons from EQ personally. Still a good rep isn't ruined by one
product unless it's obvious your shipping "Crap in a Box"(TM Funcom).

They think that people will make new characters to get the goodies
instead of paying some lowbie to help them. This will increase farming
not decrease it. And since an appropriate level player is the one
farming the item there is no way to invoke the Play fair rules either.
If they included new character slots with the expansion maybe it would
fly but they are not and thus this expansion immediately excludes
players with all their slots filled to above 30. It also forces a
player to decide between the time cost of releveling a new character
or the time cost of getting a friend or guildie of appropriate level
to help them.
