I bet you hate those little sprinkles on your cupcakes too.  They don't
add to the flavor and they are only there for show.

And you don't have any t-shirts with writing or picture 'cause that would
make other waste there time trying to read it as you walked by and it doesn't
add to the functionality of the shirt anyway.

And you never pick a face for your avatar.
And you hate the trees in Kunark.
And you they should get rid of spell effects.
And the way a Wisp bounces around has no purpose.
They should just stop trying to add flavor to the game.

Okay, I'm done ranting now.  Obviously it's way past
my lunch time and I'm being cranky.
