It seems Nvidia's legal wrangling was not how you make it out to be.. They
benchmarks were all found to be correct in the method of testing the new
chipsets, and Nvidia was found to be correct!

Kinda like the old processor speed comparisions, they were all correct just
reporting them with a skewed view. Much like P4 versus Athlon.. even still
going on today..

But discussion aside :) I don't forsee either cards making a huge difference
in the system you have listed...
