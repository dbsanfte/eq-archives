But then again I bet you 'll have fonder memories of that toon. Just because
of the challenge.

I still think back on my uber rogue in the 30's with banded/black iron
wielding a bloodclaw and scout blade dreaming of owning a SBD. hehe

Just to see how much the game has changed I started a warrior on kane server
to see how much wealth could be gotten fast. Created Dec 10. played 1 to 2
hours a night every other night. I wish /played filtered out /trader time.
But level 13 and have about 2K plat and bought ~3K of gear with about 2K in
inventory to be sold. Rather amazing. Naturally on a brand new server it
would be better to focus on exp only but still on a what 6 month old server
a level 13 can amass 7K. wow.
