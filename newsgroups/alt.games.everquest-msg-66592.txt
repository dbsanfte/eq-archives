I have had the same problem.  I haven't checked available memory, but I have
logged back in without rebooting, and the game loads fine.  The problem only
exists when I go LD or exit the game, and don't go completely back to
desktop.

I've found the only way to exit the Black Screen is to reboot (WinME).
