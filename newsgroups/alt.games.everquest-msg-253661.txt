Seems that no matter how high a level I get, or how much money I spend
on armour, I still look like i'm wearing ugly green pyjamas :) I look
like the pied piper.

I've started doing the elysians for their druid armour and have gotten
a few pieces and it does look a lot better, though stat wise it's not
as good as what I already have. 

With all the great graphic updates they have done lately I wish they
would spruce up the poor old druids so they don't always look like
they're wearing a jolly green jumpsuit :)

Cheers,

The hardest thing about this world is living in it.
