And what about invitees...i get invited to raid because they CAN'T find 
a guildie cleric to go along. What? You want me to pay for my own dots 
[of the last 5 raid invites i have gotten, 1 would pay me out of guild 
funds for dots, 4 would not] and risk dying and losing a small portion 
of my xp, or dying repeatedly and losing a small portion of my xp[and at 
55 raid xo is so infinitesimal i tend to put raid xp towards aa 
points]...and I dont get to loot.

Gee, I happen to have 3 components from Hate for a gem quest...but 
*your* uber guild who cant field a cleric *wont* let me loot an emblem 
*i* need to get a gem that will eventually give me flowing thought and 
make me a more efficient cleric...all because I am *not* part of *your* 
guild...

And people wonder why I don't do raids any more...other than ring wars 
[killer faction=)] and epics for *very* good friends.

I will stick to LDoN for a while i think...at least i can augment what 
goodies I have, and some plat to pay for dots and other goodies...
