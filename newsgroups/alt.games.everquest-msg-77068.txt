It's an ingredient in certain baking recipes. A bit grisly; but they do increase
stats a bit. For instance, Blackened Tier'dal (dark elf meat, spices, garnish)
gives you 1 dex, 2 int, 1 agi when eaten. Dwarf chops (dwarf meat, spices,
garnish) add 2 str, 2 sta. Elven veal (high elf parts, spices, garnish) adds 1
to dex, wis, agi, and int, all 4.) Gnome kabobs (gnome meat, spices, jug of
sauce) gives you 2 dex and 2 int. Smoked wood elf (wood elf parts, spices) adds
2 wis and 2 agi. You get the picture. Most of this stuff has the added advantage
of next to no weight; it's very nice food for an iksar monk or certain
necromancers. =P

To say nothing of the incredibly satisfying reaction when you offer than
annoying dwarf cleric (I won't mention any names) who claims to have smoked your
parents who sadly disappeared mysteriously when you were a child [/em sniffs a
bit, and blots her eyes] that nice stack of fresh dwarf chops. (This druid had
an *excellent* role playing reason to kill those nasty, little dwarven horrors,
thank you very much. =P ) Or perhaps an appropriate gift for a beggar, if you
happen to have the right kind of cannibalistic food on you when he makes his
plea. [/em grins evilly]
