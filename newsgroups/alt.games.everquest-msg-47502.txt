I know you didn't read his/her entire statement and later said that you
didn't catch it.. but.. I just wanna add onto this.. :)

Another "neat" example is that pesty dog/wolf in Rivervale.  Whats annoying
about this mutt is that it will attack even a halfling with ally faction
with everyone in Rivervale.

I once had it attack me when zoning in from Misty Thicket (since it is of
course just the best place to port/bank at) and there it was, somewhere
around a corner from me as I was running to the bank I suppose it followed
me (it didnt hit me even once)... but then I heard it.. I looked back and
sure enough the mutt was attacking me.  Knowing it gives bad faction to RV
if I kill it, I just let it have its fun, trying me as its chew toy.
Welllll, long and behold thats when a friendly level 20ish comes behind
it/me and kills it.  I was sooooo upset, you just dont know.  I said simply
"why?" the response was "it was attacking you" my response was "I appreciate
the thought, however, lacking it was... it hadn't hit me once, though I know
received bad faction for you killing it while it was attacking me."  I
suppose I figured anyone who would bother killing it or could, would simply
leave it alone as I was full health and wasn't /yell'ing for help.

That night I went from Ally to Kindly.  Not a huge deal, but, wasn't too
happy never-the-less. :(

Moral of the story.  Dont help a level 56 Druid when they aren't /yelling,
attacking something (which is level 10 at best) or otherwise asking for
help. ;p

I feel I might have been a little hard on the person that killed that mutt..
but... knowing I took a faction hit, I couldn't remain as calm as I would
have liked.  Oh well, went out killed things in Misty, I am Ally again.
<shrug>  It's funny when I look back on it.. a little.

Another thing.  Some lowbies sometimes have a desire to heal someone without
first looking around them.  In one particular case, someone was kiting (or
trying) a FP guard in EC.  As he was running to the WC zone line to get off
its agro and otherwise LIVE, this poor lowbie healed him (with her maybe 10
hp heal spell)... said failed kiter successfully zone (had sow or jboots
definitely).. guard comes along, takes one swing at this poor level 11-12ish
Cleric... Cleric dead. :(
