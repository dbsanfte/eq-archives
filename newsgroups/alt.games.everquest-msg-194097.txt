Umm, VOV?  Instead of say VCOC?
VOV: Str 30, Agi 30 AC 21 Haste 30%
VCOC: haste 45%
MRR: Att 14, Str 20, DS 8, Haste 22%

You'd take VOV over MRR when its only an 8% boost to haste, but take VOV over
VCOC which is a 15% drop in haste traded for some stats and AC?

At any rate, look at my post again, you'll see I say "If the group has a spell
haste on, then the question is meaningless" so my intent was to ask only about
cases with no chanter haste on.

Yes, I understood this, the reason I posted was in hopes of seeing some
discussion as to what various situations might be where one or the other was
better, so as to help weigh the descision.

Say I'm grouped with one melee, whats better, more attack and DS or more
haste?  What about with 2 melee?  4 melee?

How about the mobs, do they make a difference?  Low level mobs, more haste,
high level mobs more attack, say?

Lots of mobs, go for the DS, single mob go for the haste?

I'm not a melee oriented bard, so I haven't really examined the relative
effects of haste, DS, and attack; this means I don't have much of a handle on
the relative usefulness of each.  Up till now, I haven't really had to choose
even in a group, but here's a song that makes these distinctions vital.

Its no use being versatile if you don't know whats better in one situation over
another.  Thats not "versatile" its "scatterbrained"
