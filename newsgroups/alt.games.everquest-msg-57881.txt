I normally don't answer top posters, but I'll make an exception in your
case since it's a short post and I'm in a good mood today.
:-)

The Sleeper is, effectively, the "Boss Mob" of Norrath. He's at the
bottom of the highest level dungeon in the game. (Ok.... *ONE OF* the
highest level dungeons.) Mega destructive dragon. One of a kind. There's
a whole history of him on the Sony Home pages if you dig for it. Likely
he will never be killed. But he stays asleep until somebody kills all
four of his guardian "Warders" who are there to keep him asleep for all
eternity. Then, once awoken, the warders are gone forever, apparently.
Don't know if the Sleeper remains in his zone later on to be attacked or
if he just disappears. When you wake him he goes on a multi-zone rampage
killing everyone who comes in his sight.
