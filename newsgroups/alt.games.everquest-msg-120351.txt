Today's highschools, the silent guy isn't always just dumb, many times he's
drugged, which is why all the sluts/girls like him.

It's funny today, to read some of those ads from girls or guys looking for a
boyfriend/girlfriend.  You often wonder how the hell they expect to find
anyone with what they right.  Either coming right out and making themselves
look like a less respectable person, or other things such as saying they
want a nice mature person, and all they want to do is party.
