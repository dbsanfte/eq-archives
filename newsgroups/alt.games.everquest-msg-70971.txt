	2HS is preferrable to Dual Wield until at least level 35, and more like
the 40s, ceteris paribus.  (It is unlikely that you will have a quality 2H
Blunt weapon until much later in life.)

	Reason: you do not get a Double Attack check on the off-hand until the low
30s, assuming you keep the skill capped, and it takes a while before you will
get enough Dual Wield and Double Attack successes to really dish it out.

	You should Dual Wield some 1H weapons when you level, to keep your skills
capped (and preferrably keep 1H Slash, 1H Blunt and Pierce all capped), but
once you've done that, get out a two-hander.
