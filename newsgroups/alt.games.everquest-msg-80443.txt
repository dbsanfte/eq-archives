You can do a search using the word "everquest" and you'll get a ton of
hits. Almost all the good sites have links to take you to even more
sites. You can do an even more indepth search by typing " everquest
spells components" and you'll likely get hits. My newbie site of the
moment is    http://eq.castersrealm.com/   It's really not just a
newbie site, I think it's a little more user friendly for the new
comer, however.
