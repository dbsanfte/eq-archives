The only reason a Druid would be better in a group than a Shaman is when he
gets his evac spell.  Other than that, I cannot see any good reason for a
Druid in a group.  Now with POP expansion out, traveling around the world is
a breeze so needing a druid for teleporting is no longer needed.

Druids are better soloists than Shamans.  But if you are looking for soloing
then go for a pet class like a Mage or Necro.
