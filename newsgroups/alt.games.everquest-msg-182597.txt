Ok, I'm assuming that you never got the lvl 20 fire pet.  Getting it is
pretty easy, but has a small amount of risk.  All of the lvl 20 scrolls are
on sale from an elf named ELESSERYL TERUSSER in the Ocean of Tears.  Check
out "Ocean of Tears Map 2" (http://www.eqatlas.com/ootmap2.html) from
www.eqatlas.com.  Catch the boat that goes from Freeport to Butcherblock.
Get off at the first stop, which is an island with a dock.  You need to swim
west to the island marked as "8" on the eqatlas map.  When you arrive at the
island you should see a that it is a big hill with a building at the top.
In the building is the vendor.  Buy the scrolls you need and gate back home.

Risks -
There are pirates that roam the island that you disembark on, so invis
yourself or summon a pet the second you step off the boat.
The island with the vendor may have a cyclops on it, so keep alert.
Going to the wrong island - not recommended.
If you are evil, I don't think the vendor will sell to you.
