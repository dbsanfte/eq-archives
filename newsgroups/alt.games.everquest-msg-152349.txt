I'm currently using a 33k hardware modem (old one)- supraexpress336V) on a
AMD450 256ram 16mb graphics (probably upgrade to a 64meg one b4 w/e). I seem
to be able to set the speed to 57600 or 115200 - whether it actually uses
those speeds when i do I dont know.

I lag like hell in 6plus grp raids but its workable, especially using f9.

This weekend Im goin to fear with a 6grp raid force , all previous raids ive
done have been dragons so Mezzing wasnt an issue.

Now what Im wondering is should I plug in my old 56k software modem even
though it will use more system resources ? Oh and I have never had any LD
issues with either modem in a large raid force scenario.

Any advice greatly appreciated :)

Cheers

Kev
