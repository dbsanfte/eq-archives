Nah, it's cleric gets first 3, then alpha.  Unfortunately, my name starts 
with Z.  The real problem, though, is I never, ever seem to win a roll on 
something sellable, as opposed to something that's actually an upgrade for 
me.  Just seems like no matter how ya slice it, 5KPP is a fat lot of plat 
to dump on something I can't even use indoors.
