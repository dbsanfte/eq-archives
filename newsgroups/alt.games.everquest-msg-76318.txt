  Maybe, but "I'll tell you a secret" sounds very suspicious.  Even if
the quest doesn't lead anywhere, she should give at least SOME
response to someone giving her a drink, even if the "secret" she tells
you is the equivalent of "I'm not wearing anything beneath this chain
mail."  There's not much point in an "interactive" NPC to add "color"
if that NPC doesn't actually interact with you.

  This is really stupid "flavor" if that is indeed what it is.  My
suspicion is that it's a broken quest, though I could be wrong.

  I suppose you also tried, "What secret?"  It's also possible that
someone elsewhere knows what her favorite drink is.

  I was pretty easily able to tell just from following the dialog to
it's conclusion that it was a "joke."  It basically goes like this:

Hail, Lady.

Lady says, "Hi, could you leave me alone, I'm not doing so well."

Why not?

Lady says, "Because this stupid guy keeps bothering me.  I told him
that I wouldn't talk with him until he made me a burynai bundt cake."

How do you make a burynai bundt cake?

Lady says, "Burynai bundt cake?  There's no such thing!"

  It was pretty obviously a joke, in my opinion.  A guy she doesn't
like is bothering him, so she tells him to earn her respect, he has to
make a cake (which conveniently doesn't actually exist.)  I'm not the
most terribly clever person, but the "joke" of this dialog seemed
pretty obvious to me.  I got a good laugh out of it, too.
