Depends on the group im in. usually i stay back with the group singing,
while a "tank" pulls (my ac is 830 so no trouble there. but I cant sing mana
*and* pull.)Thus I dont get hit on a lot, and im lucky if I get any defense
in groups. Defense is inredibly hard to train after about 180.

I want to get it maxed and out of the way while the blue mobs are still only
hitting for 60 and 70... not wait for another 5 levels when blues will be
hitting for 90's (and more often too)

I make a point of keping defense maxed till at least 34 or 35 as a druid.
Its free ac. People who dont train it are just short changing themselves. In
fact, with decent cheap armor and maxxed defense, it takes a lot less
downtime using thorns/dot/melle than kiting or root kiting. As for offense
and weapon skills, yeah I couldnt care less about them as a cleric or druid
in the long run. My druid doesnt even use a weapon anymore... got a paw
instead. I dont even bother carrying a weapon. Sometime ill do the epic, but
right now im busy with my alts.
