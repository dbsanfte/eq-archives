I'd be awfully wary on that point alone.

On the other hand, if you can afford the loss, then you *might* reap a
reward out of it.

I've had a stranger take a chance on me.  He was selling an item for 6k that
I knew I'd never see at that price for a while so I offered him my 2.2k from
the bank and he allowed me to pay in installments (took about 3 weeks).  I
care a lot about my rep, being a rogue whose class is often maligned at
higher levels (when they start picking blue diamonds, etc).  When you're
looking for a pickup group most of the time, rep means a helluva lot.
