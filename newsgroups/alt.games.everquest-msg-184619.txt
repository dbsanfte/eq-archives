Actually, windowed mode and fully screen are completely different,
regardless of the size.

In full screen, you mouse is controlled by EQ.

In windowed mode, your mouse is controlled by Windows, which passes the
mouse information to EQ. In fact, everything is controlled by Windows and
then passed to EQ.

Settings are set depending on what mode you are in. EQ settings only take
effect when you are in full screen. This includes brightness. To make
changes in windowed mode, make changes in the Control Panel. This also
includes brightness (which is changed in Control Panel, Display, Settings,
<your video card>).
