    The other night, a cleric that had the spell took two people in guild
(cleric and druid) that needed it and got it for both of them, so I'm hoping
with just a partner it should go fast. Now, to find the partner!

    Yeah, against tough mobs your damage is pretty much from MoR and the

Cleared to a friend in Frenzy in Lower Guk recently, rather than invis in,

here!

    As someone with Infravision, I can't stand Ultravision. Gives everything
an annoying blue tint. But it sure is clear.

    There's many of them in my guild. The more mature environment is very
enjoyable.
