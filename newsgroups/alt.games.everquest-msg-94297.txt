To be SOMEWHAT fair...  He did post his message PRIOR to the patch being
made.

Well, the other problem is...  90% of the consumer base assumes that things
are easy fixes.  A good deal of that consumer base has no clue on
programming issues, or believe they do, but have no inkling about the code
in question and claim they could fix things.  One guy, Miller something,
went on about how Verant should focus on the critical bugs instead of the
cosmetic bugs of the game.  While that is fine and dandy, it shows that
this guy has no concept of proper programming, especially since GUI/Client
Programming != Ingame Coding/Scripting nor does it != Model coding.

It is always a 'joy' to listen to players who lump various types of
programming into one thing and expect miracles to happen or believe
something that is not necessarily true.  And this isn't ass kissing, this
is just me going, "Get over yourself." cause I do have people expecting me
to fix things that are out of my hands.  (I even had one person criticize
me with, "Well, why the hell did we hire you if you can't do it?" from a
secretary on something that I had no hands on to begin with.)  In general,
the consumer expecation has always been radically contradictory to what is
possible.
