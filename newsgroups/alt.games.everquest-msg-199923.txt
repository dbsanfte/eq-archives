 Depends on where you are trying to go. That's the part I wasn't clear
on since I didn't know which he was referring to. Once you have your
flag from SolRo (Plane of Fire) you don't need the minis. We've had more
than a few missing minis that can zone into Fire just fine. What I was
seeking clarification on was access to his chamber because that's still
a pain each raid to get everyone into his room.

 Hmm hadn't thought about that one. I have had a theories because the
Raid feature does seem a bit buggy. Will have to test that one out next
time.
