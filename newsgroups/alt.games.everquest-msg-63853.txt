1. Make sure "File and Print Sharing" is enabled under network
properties. (Right-Click on Network Nieghborhood, and select
properties.)

2. Open up Network Neighborhood on both PCs (Double-Click desktop
icon) and see if you can browse "Entire Network" on either one of
them. If F/P Sharing is working you should be able to browse to the
Workgroup you created. 

My guess is that the GW you reloaded cannot browse, and the IBM can.

3. Check the Network settings on the IBM (Right-Click on Network
Nieghborhood, and select properties.) You should see two Clients
loaded (Client for Microsoft Networks, and Microsoft Family Logon)
Also take not of the protocols loaded. You should have TCP/IP and
NetBEUI loaded. 

Make sure the GW has the same Clients and Protocols loaded (I am
assuming that the settings on the IBM worked prior to the format, and
that nothing has changed on the IBM.)

4. Create a "Shared" folder on each PC. This will cause each PC to
broadcast the availablity of the share. It takes a few minutes for
Windows PCs on a LAN to sync and establish communications between each
other. Once both PCs are able to "Browse the Entire Network" without
any errors, you should be good to go.

Cheers
