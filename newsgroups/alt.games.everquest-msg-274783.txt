It should be obvious and it may be accurate but it is useless. The site
doesn't tell you which fighter can use bows, dual wield weapons, throwing
weapons, different kind of shields etc. It took me some time and money to
find out that I couldn't use dual wield weapons, but I had the skill to use
it as a one hand weapon but I couldn't figure out how to equip the second
dual wild weapon. Lost a few silver on that :o)
