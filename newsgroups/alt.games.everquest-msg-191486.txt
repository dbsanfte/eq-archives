   My beloved ogre Lenny just retired from the navy, and he spent
years working with the email process aboard the USS Fife.  I have
asked him to read your message and give his take on it, which I
well render for clarity's sake.  

   He says it seems to be of one of two things to him.  Either
the server stateside is full due to the satellite connection
being severed due to security concerns (some not so bright
sailors have been know in the past to make such faux pas as
emailing sensitive information to non-authorized recipients), or
the satellite is connection is still up and sending, but the ship
has blocked all incoming messages except for those going to
certain email address, such as the Caption of the vessel or other
high ranking officers.  Again, a security measure.

   He says the chance of getting the message you are getting due
the death of the server message is very unlikely, in his
opinion.  He recommends you step back into the last century, and
use snail mail.  If you really want make an impact, put said
snail mail in a box filled with Gummy bears, jelly beans, and
gumballs.  I have employed this method in the past, and Lenny was
able to purchase much love and respect amongst his fellow crew
members at a very good exchange rate.  Plus, nothing says "I'm
thinking of you and I care" than a box of bad-for-you snacks.

   I hope this helps.

Annie
