Wait, but aren't you the very same person who will run to zone, turn 
around to check on the mobs, then type a /say to the people there, and 
then zone?  How is that any better?  At least the guy fighting is buying 
time for people who are afk or medding or whatever.  He's an idiot, but 
he's trying to do the right thing.  I'm still waiting to hear your 
justification.
