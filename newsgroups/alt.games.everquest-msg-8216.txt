And the answer is that it's neither, it's the JourneymanBoots effect.

Which doesn't make it the same thing as SoW.

Correct.

Not that I know of, why?

No need for apologies.

I was just (slightly) correcting your post, pointing out that
the JBoots/Traveller's Boots effect is not quite the same as SoW.
People contemplating purchasing the boots need to be clear
on the exact effect it confers, and its pros and cons.  It is
similar to SoW, but there are key differences.

Nothing personal in that at all.
