If you're on your first character or don't have high level characters to get good 
eq then I'm sure you can find some good things in the bazaar assuming you have 
Luclin. I'm on my first character, level 40. Before the new UI and the bazaar I 
had pretty basic stuff, I was even pretty lucky to have some decent donations 
(Ivy Braided Cords, Lockjaw Hide Vest, Polished Bone Bracelet, etc.) Once the 
bazaar came in I took a trip there and while I didn't have much money (certainly 
not 500pp) I did manage to buy little things here and there that were a lot 
better than what I had.

As for leveling I might suggest the Lake of Ill Omen or the Frontier Mountains 
(one zone over from the Lake).
