What of it? Getting an "A+" Rebuilding an engine yourself in shop class 
is not the same as paying a mechanic to do it, winning a marathon is not 
the same as buying a red ribbon, climbing a mountain is not the same 
thing as chartering a helicopter to drop you off at the top.

It doesn't matter where he got the money or how hard he worked for it. 
His only achievement is flipping 20,000 hamburgers, or selling crack to 
children or whatever it was he did for the money.

No.

Some things aren't for sale. Personal achievement is one of those 
things.

If you try to buy it you just cheapen it for everyone, your a poser.

Max level, items, flags, are thought by many to be personal achievments 
in EQ. For them the point of the game is to achieve them, if you buy 
them then you didn't achieve them and it cheapens it for everyone.

A hockey hall of famer, father of the year, military promotion, olympic 
medalist, oscar nominee, etc are all examples of RL personal 
achievments... if you could just buy them on ebay they'd lose their 
meaning to everyone.

People who do buy olympic medals and then wander around wearing them 
earn the same disgust and disdain that ebayers in EQ frequently run into 
for the same reason. You *didn't* earn it. You bought it. So what if you 
earned the money? That doesn't mean shit. An olympic medal recognizes 
excellence at a sport not your skill at flipping burgers and ebay 
sniping. One cannot be legitimately traded for the other.

Now the counter argument is that you aren't buying the "A+" you just 
want the rebuilt engine to stick in your car and drive around... and 
that's perfectly valid counter argument... except that in EQ, the A+ and 
the engine are the same thing, and a large number of the playerbase 
regard the items, levels, and flags as the trophies they've earned. Even 
if you don't view it as a trophy, and just as an item to use you are 
surrounded by people who do.

That's why i think there should be two games... one for those who want 
to pay for items, one who want them to just be earned. Ultimately 
neither person is inherently more right, and when you mix them together 
they just fight endlessly. =)

If SOE wants to sell items, fine by me, as long as they also create a 
server where you can't, and get banned if you do.

For the record I'd play on the server where you were not allowed to buy 
or sell items or characters for RL cash.
