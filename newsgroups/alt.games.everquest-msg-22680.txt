On a similar note.

I was playing my new Enchanter in Qeynos. Every time I'd go to Sneed's to
sell stuff I'd kill the Sewer Rat upstairs to try and get the head (for
faction). Anyway, I run upstairs and a high-level Dwarf is up there asking
if I saw a bag anywhere. I think he had just tried to twink an alt (bad
choice of location LOL). I said no and he continued looking around.

Is it possible that the Sewer Rat picked up his stuff while he was logging
off and on?

I know regular NPC's pick stuff up, but Mobs?
