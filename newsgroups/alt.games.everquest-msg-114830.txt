This is EXACTLY what progresses a guild. It keeps both old hats wanting to
raid and newcommers wanting to join and raid. If you are not going to give
newcommers any loot they will figure it out and leave. If you are not going
to give certain classes loot untill other classes are full then they will
figure this out and leave too. You need them all, while it is nice to have a
tank with a ridiculous ac this does you zip good if there is no one to
support that tank. Uber equipped tanks have a nasty habit of leaving for
greener pastures as well.

Officer called loot only works when it approximates what random should have
done anyway ,with the advantage that the last piece someone needs gets sent
to that person. It is impossible to be unbiased calling loot. No matter how
hard you try you are going to piss people off. If what you offer as a guild
can not overcome this then you cannot afford to call loot ,it will just send
people straight out the door.

You where pissed enough to come write about it exactly because you
desperately needed that cleric and where shafting her for loot as far as she
was concerned.
