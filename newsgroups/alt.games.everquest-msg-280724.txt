It has become more unstable in the last 2 years,for example when
switching chars,I am almost every time thrown back to the server
select screen,watching for 5 minutes or so the dreaded "you already
have a character logged in" box.
An issue I never had before a year or 2 ago.
Probably a symptom of adding too much expansions without proper
quality control,game was much more stable when we got an expansion 
once a year,but hey why not try to squeeze the last cents out of
existing customers,because they have no intentions to win new.

And before you come and say its my pc,Morrowind,NWN annd assorted
other games which are as hardware demanding as EQ or more,almost
never crash,even when playing for extended times.

And as another poster mentioned,what about the map background,thats
most annoying,this cant be hard to fix,clearly a sign they dont care
for quality.
