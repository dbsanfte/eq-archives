Offense and weapon skill-ups

Defense and Dodge, Parray, etc. skill-ups

Handy for weaklings to avoid encumbrance, helps the weak-minded
feel better about themselves.

Can be useful at low levels to get melee's STA up to 100+.
Adds noticeable HP to tanks at higher levels.

Yes, the first AC buff is stupid, wait for the next one.
My Paladin main assures you that AC buffs are worthwhile, Paladin
is such a weak soloer that the effect is quite noticeable ("Woot!
I lived this time!").

It's still most mana efficient heal then, don't get better until
Regen.  Unfortunately it is such a small heal that its usefulness
declines steadily, I used it a whole lot less once I made L19 and
got Healing.

Agreed.  Only one I can think of is if you are fighting alot of
Drybone Skeletons then any boost to Fire Resist is helpful.

A bit weaker than Druid nukes, but starting with Spirit Strike
they are sometimes useful.

Your baby slows make rerooting fairly easy.  My Inny Shaman
(Troll) hasn't got his snare necklace yet, but he's not high
enough to make that very painful, plenty of places to hunt
where mobs are either not social or have small social agro
radii.

Correct, slow is wonderful for soloing.

It's useful if you're fighting mobs that stun a lot and your
MA is not an Ogre.

It is no damage.  Your DoTs won't break it all that often, chance
of break seems to be scaled to size of DD hit so the 10 dmg my
current poison DoT does (at L22) rarely breaks root.

Short duration charms suck.

It's a loooooong stinking wait, and my Troll is KOS lots of places.

Gotta DoT 'em all!  Chain-casting Inner Fire after Dotting has
worked well in groups (don't bother with Disease DoT when groupped).
