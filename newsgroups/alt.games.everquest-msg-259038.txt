Yeah, that's what commodization does, but it's not an irreversible trend 
that rules out other approaches. Collector's Editions are becoming pretty 
common and they present another alternative. There will probably always be a 
market supplying those of us who still enjoy that sort of thing, while the 
rest who could care less about anything other than the bits on the CD will 
always get what they want. Guys like me will probably help finance it. ;-)

Yeah, and I know a lot who do, so what does that prove lol? Every time this 
topic comes up there are voices on both sides of the issue. But whether we 
care or not, it's going to come down to economics and game publishers are 
already pretty strapped as it is in a tight market, so it won't surprise me 
to see the current trend continue for a while. All things considered, I'd 
rather they made money and continued providing me with games, no argument 
there.

Many of you guys who don't care about manuals seem to be saying the same 
thing: "I'd rather see them put more money into a good game.". Well, DUH. Of 
course I'd rather have a better game in the first place, I don't see anyone 
arguing that game content should be sacrificed so that we can have better 
manuals lol! But you can do both and it's been done plenty of times and 
profitably. Certifiable monster titles like Morrowind, C&C Generals, 
Baldur's Gate, Warcraft III all had manuals I enjoyed spending time with. I 
remember Warcraft III having an excellent manual with maps, lots of 
backstory, unit and structure descriptions, pretty substantive little book 
as I recall. Wargames, virtually every RTS I've ever owned, and so on. It 
doesn't have to be an either-or proposition.

Give me both! Give me a nice manual to enjoy and anyone who prefers instead 
to watch a computer can do that too.
