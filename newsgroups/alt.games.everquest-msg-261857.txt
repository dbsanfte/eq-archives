Hello,

I just got a laptop to play my other account.  I would recommend atleast 512
Ram and 64mb dedicated Video Card.  That is what I got fairly cheap and it
works great.  I got the NVidia 64mb FX 5200 Go card, and no problems yet.

You should probably read the tech support forums also, because Sony does not
"officially" support EQ on laptops.  Hope this helps.
