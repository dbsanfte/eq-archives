Not really. Stupid e.g. follows :

Group of 6 kills HG
HG drops 200pp 1000gp 20000sp and 11cp 

1) Divied "wholes" = 33pp 166gp 3333sp 1cp [4 calculations amount
irrelevent]

2) Randomly assigne remainders 
Amounts remaining are 2pp 4gp 2sp and 5cp thus = 15 more calculations

Notice that the amount of coinage does not change the number of calcs,
only the size of the remainder.

6000pp is dealt with with 1 calculation
11pp takes 6
Maximum = 1 + (5 *4) = 21 calculations.
and you can hit this with only 5pp 5gp 5sp 5cp

Note smaler groups less calculations.

This solution seems to be very scailable.

Not saying that the server could take it, but the amount of loot would
not change it.
