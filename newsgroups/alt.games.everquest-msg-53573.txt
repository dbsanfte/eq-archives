Deaths that you can be rezzed from, locking in a dungeon box, these
things are all far too short term to make a real difference to the
dickheads in question. And insta-banning accounts is too drastic the
other way. I *still* maintain that the best solution is a massive
faction hit. No matter what your "base" factions were, or what you've
improved, altered etc. when you go in and attack/kill one of the quest
NPC's, you get a bottom of the barrel, maximum KOS to whatever
applicable spread of NPCs accross Norrath would make sense. Maybe some
long, really fucked up quest required to be able to fix it. Publicize
*that* really well all over, on the home page, in patch messages, at
log-in, etc. and people just *might* start playing along, or just
skipping the GM events if they don't want to participate in the spirit
of it.
