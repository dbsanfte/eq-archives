I dunno that taking a break from EQ to watch TV is an improvement.  TV is
totally passive and totally lacking in community. Forget the quality (or
lack thereof), it's more a matter of TV being so completely isolating- You
sit and stare at this picture you don't interact with in the least, and even
if someone is sitting next to you, you don't talk to them (some exceptions,
I know, but as a rule)..  As repetitive as EQ is, you do have to think at
least a little.  You do, for the most part, have to interact with people.
Your brain does have to be active.

During my EQ breaks I take up something that "produces" (writing,
programming, etc.) rather than "consumes" (TV). Or something that gets me
out of the house (hiking (man, those mountain graphics are impressive),
bowling, etc.)  Or even something that puts me in contact with other real
life people (going out, meeting friends for dinner, etc).

Of course, trolling the more annoying people in this group (hi biz!) is also
fun, if not as social as it could be.
