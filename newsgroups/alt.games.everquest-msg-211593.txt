This is  a very serious accuastion regarding this player, surely at the age
of 43! you you must be  aware that the best course of action regarding an
incident like this, would be to contact the Gm's in game. via the /report
command. If that doesn't work then the next course of action may be to
E-mail sony customer services direct.

By purposly posting this information, direct to a public newsgroup, it is
more indicitive of the postings of  a bored/spotty youth, who may have  a
grudge against the said player. And is hopeing said character will get
spammed with in game tells!. Then the concerns of a mature and responsible
adult. Perhaps you should consider the implications before public posting
accusastions such as these.
