They don't. They never have liked soloers and have always geared the game
towards forced grouping. The only difference before is they left some
"holes", ie Necroes and Druids where you could sacrifice your grouping
ability to gain soloing ability.

They just closed that "loophole".

Sure, they changed group dynamics and made these classes more useful in
groups with this patch, but they totally nuked *all* soloing beyond pathetic
limping from the reading of it.

I don't solo because I want to play a Necro, I play a Necro because I solo.

There is a reason I don't group, it is because I am a complete spastic moron
in a group. I am the one who gets everyone wiped doing stupid dumb shit all
the time. I am not anti-social though, I am guilded and keep my guild
entertained via /gu chat and rescue fellow guild members when needed. But
having said that - they are all fully aware I am not shirking by staying
absent from raids and xp grind groups - I am just doing my collective duty
to it's fullest.

My accounts going back into the closet for a while, thats for sure. And no,
no-one gets my stuff ; )

I am sure that at some time in the future this chance at getting a life
again will only end in disaster as per usual and I will soon be back into
the mind anaesthesia of EQ picking over the crumbs of what I had. Bugger.
Maybe it's time for the garbage bag of NO2 and a panduit strap after all. My
RL job just got nerfed to fuckhouse as well.

How are us lunatics meant to keep it together when both reality AND
make-believe gank us? In the epic words from the script of  "four weddings
and a funeral":

"Fuck....Fuck....Fuck....Fuck....Fuck....Fuck....Fuck....Fuck....Fuck....Fuc
k....Fuck....Fuck....Fuck....Fuck........"
