or for most lv51s, go for something VERY fast. its unlikely u'll see a CoL
or ssra blades for a while yet, like 55+ so try something like lammy,
defiance, hell, start your epic.

upgrade your ears, orc fang, pfft, for 1k or less grab a vah shir claw
earring, try something else in other. not sure what tho =)

bow, get the 25/35 bow, not sure of its name, ssra bow? cant remember. its
nice and cheap

bp - try for something with a hell of a lot more AC, even a barbed bp would
be better (2kish) or acrylia breastplate (less than 1k)

bracers - dwarven?* never seen the stats, so mebbe not, but bracer of
defense is always nice for 1kish (ac15 3sta 15hps)

back - dire wolf-hide cloak is in price range of 500ish, so that is np
