Yep, VP key over 2 months before, and 5 nights in VP before I got the damn 
HS key.  The really stupid part is that I generally do explore the unused 
dungeons much more than the average player.  I kept meaning to get the HS 
key, but Xalgoz wasn't up when I went to Kaesora for the ground-spawn for 
the VP key.  I should have been able to solo my way into Kaesora and camp 
Xalgoz, but it is soooo damn risky without a handy escape plan.
