Earth to bizbee, you're a stalker/Usenet kook.
What are you planning to do with that super secret publicly posted for
anyone to find information?

Until you get off your ass and actually go kill someone, your Google
stalking just makes you look like a kook.    Kick it in to high gear and get
psycho stalker status, because Usenet Google stalking kook status is really
pathetic.

In case you haven't noticed and I'm sure you haven't, if it weren't for
idiots like you, no one would have to post X-No-Archive: yes.
