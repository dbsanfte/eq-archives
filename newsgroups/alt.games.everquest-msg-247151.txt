I was trying to get the last few threads in velks for my coldain shawl when
I came across an interesting problem. A group of level 65's had claimed the
floor as their camp and suggested I move up the stairs. I'm not tough enough
to do that and I was surprised, as groups had always shared that floor
before. "We can take this whole dungeon", they said.

Now the level bar is being raised to 70 and I wonder if we won't get to the
point where someone will be claiming PoJ or PoD as theirs and trying to get
rid of all the people ksing 'their' mobs?

What do people think?
