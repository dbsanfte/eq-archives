I'm still looking for a safe place for a LV10 Iksar Shadow Knight to hunt
in. Field of Bone's pit is either green or red, rarely anything I can get
EXP from, Swamp of No Hope is great EXP, seemingly enough yellow cons, but I
lose EXP from the wandering Frogloks and the evil Iksars faster than I'm
gaining it (spent about 8 hrs here so far only to lose half a bubble EXP
over all and now in danger of losing my LV). So I've left there. Any other
ideas of where I can hunt SUCCESSFULLY? Lake of Ill Omen was working at LV9,
but that was mostly blue cons and still I had trouble of not being able to
find anything near my LV very often (rarely found anything above blue but
below red).  Any ideas on zones, and especially AREAS OF ZONES of where I
can solo hunt? My grouping experience in Kunark hasn't been that great. Only
idiots who aren't organized and either zone out and group elsewhere and
ignore your questions of "where are you at?" and anything else you say, or
people who don't con before pulling, run around constantly and train
multiple mobs on you thinking that a group of 3 (LV7-10) can take on 2 LV14+
at the same time. If I'd been having better grouping experience I'd be doing
that but I've only lost more EXP in grouping than even in the past few
nights of Swamp of No Hope and constant corpse runs.  LV10 for Iksars seams
to be a hell level, not in EXP gain, but in finding EXP to gain.  Anybody
else experiencing same or similar problems?
