hmm, sounds like another quest they rushed out the door.
I'll take my druid over there and see if I can find some kobold heads 
just to verify they drop. Quick check at eqtraders newbie quests page: 
Pally quest is posted as needing a poacher's head, sure you need kobold 
heads?  scratch that, checked allakhazam for cleric quests, you need 
kobold skulls, they are dropping in the warrens as an uncommon, so don't 
expect them every loot.
As far as spider venom, I think the 'spider venom sacs' is what will work.
Usually when doing newbie armors, you combine the materials you were 
supposed to gather in the box you were given and you get some sort of 
plate or fabric, then you combine that with the mold or pattern you were 
given when you asked about the piece in a forge or sewing kit, depending 
on what you have.

Have fun
