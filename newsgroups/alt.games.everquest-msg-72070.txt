Which, while not a syntax issue, is certainly a textbook case of
arguing semantics over common usage. Based on game emotes, every one
of my characters has been a caster, including my rogue and warrior,
whenever they activated a right-click item. Of course, this is an
absurd definition of the term and a call for "caster gear" would be
exceptionally unlikely to get me offers of a Bloodpoint or even a Jade
Chokidai Prod. Most people, yourself included DT, know that in under
such a usage, what is meant is "INT caster gear." Pretending that you
don't just makes you look more interested in winning theoretical
points in an argument than in whether or not your information is
correct.

And reptiles are not lizards, no matter how many of the proto sapiens
that live around your neck of the woods use the terms interchangeably.
