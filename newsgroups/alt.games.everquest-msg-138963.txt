Not 100% sure about ME, but here is how I get to it on win2k:

START -> CONTROL PANEL -> SYSTEM

In the "System Properties" Dialog box choose the "Advanced" tab:

then the "Performance Options..." button,

in the "Virtual memory" frame choose the "Change..." button to alter minimum
and maximum page sizes (this is where I made my change).

You will probably need to restart the computer for the changes to take
effect.
