Along these lines, I just found out yesterday that the Shaman epic quest can
be started by killing PegLeg in Butcherblock.  I was wandering through on my
way to Dagnor's Cauldron, working on my totemic armor, when PegLeg attacked
me, his friends didn't help him, as they were too low lvl.  I killed him,
and lo and behold, a lesser spirit appeared.  I used the correct key
phrases, and got my gem to take to the spirit in barbarian guise in
Freeport.  I realize that I will not be likely to complete the quest anytime
soon, but thought others would be interested in this tidbit.
