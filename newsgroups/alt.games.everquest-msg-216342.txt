At the beginning of the mission, you start at FM.

You enter the dungeon, start pulling.

Cleric mana drops to 80.

You either A: pull fast as you can for five minutes, getting cleric mana to 30, then dial it back to a
normal pull rate for the next hour or B: pull at a normal rate from the beginning.

If you need FM for mini bosses or for the big boss fight at the end, group A sits on their cans for 10
minutes waiting for the cleric, group B sits for two minutes.

If you don't need FM at all, nobody sits for any length of time.   However, group A finishes about a
minute faster than group B, because they pulled the first few fights a bit earlier.

If at any point something happens that requires more than 30% cleric mana, group A wipes, group B succedes
and either slows down a little or suffers a short down time getting back up to 80%, depending on just how
far down the mana pool got.

Also, if the rest of the group is at FM but the cleric is at 30, then the rest of the group is doing
something wrong; nuke more and the fights will be shorter, so the healer will spend less mana on it.  The
general idea is to balance out so everyone is at about the same level of mana use vis a vis their own mana
regeneration ability (so the shaman should be burning about twice as much mana as anyone else...)

And of course as I pointed out in a different response, the key to not wasting resources is to never ever
get to FM unless you Need that for a big pull; every tic at FM is wasted mana regen, but no tic at less
than FM is wasted; so if the cleric is regenning from 50M to 80M and the nukers are going from 70M to FM
thats Not wasted resources; its normal down time.  Something to avoid in general perhaps, better to have
more controlled pulls such that there's no sitting between pulls at all and all mana needed for a fight is
generated during that fight... but its not wasted.

Again I challenge you: given that you are going to pull at a controlled rate for an hour straight, keeping
mana regen and mana use balanced that entire time, what benefit is there to selecting 30% instead of 80%
as the point where you intend to keep the party (and particularly the party healer)?

Another thought; how would you feel if the party healers elected to keep the MT at 30% HP for the
beginning of each fight?
