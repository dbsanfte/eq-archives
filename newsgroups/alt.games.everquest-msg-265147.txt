I've found some fine steel weapons as well, but it does seem to be
that the special drops come only from the commanders, which thank
heavens do not come near the PoK book or LDON camp.

From the sound of it, you're hunting in Butcherblock?  (The skels
appear in 5-6 zones, as I recall.)  Try wandering further afield,
especially southwest from the camp toward the Dagnor's Cauldron
zone, and you should find lots to keep you busy. :-)
