Get some practice in with your Happy Hammer of Pharming. Find a dark
blue, melee it for a while, when you're at 30-40% root it, heal
yourself, then start in on it again. If you're falling behind on mana
root the MOB and med for a while.

The hammer is +25 DEX and Yaulp V is +75 DEX. Since melee skillups
have DEX as the main stat determining skillups, your skills should
shoot up pretty quickly. At 56 I had 1HB of 105 or so, Defense 150 or
so, bash at 35. By 57 1HB was maxed, Defense was maxed... the only
combat stats not maxed were Bash (which I keep forgetting to do)
and 2HB/H2H.

I recommend Kunark era MOBs for this BTW. They tend to hit somewhat
quickly but not very hard, which is the best combo for defense
skillups.

The main advantage to the proccing hammer in the long run is that it
lets you farm^H^H^H^H kill greens without burning mana. Eventually
you reach a point where you're only spending mana on heals and maybe
on your hammer pet.
