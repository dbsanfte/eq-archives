Yep, Seafury Cyclops are great, best hit one got on my Druid was 70 (while
medding) and I rarely had to heal my warrior ('clops slowed with shiftless,
Chloro on warrior and blood point proc'ing meant I went no lower than losing
one bubble) they are easier than hill giants for better exp (or more
importantly, they give exp to a 52) loots not bad, let my partner keep all
the jewellery, got a couple of emerald rings, fire emerald, mith amulet and
a saphire + the plat that dropped he should have got 400pp+ from that night.

Corrupted? Erm...they con yellow to my Warrior at 52...ooops.
