>- Atol's Spectral Shackles has had its casting difficulty reduced

I never noticed any problems with Atol's.  As soon as I got it, I
switched from Bonds of Force to Atol's, expecting to have to switch
back, because of the storied I'd heard about fizzles and resists, but
never had a problem.  My Wizard solos for XP, so uses this spell a
lot, do I'd expect to notice any problems.

Anyway, I have no problem with it being made easier...I just don't see
why they did this. :-)
