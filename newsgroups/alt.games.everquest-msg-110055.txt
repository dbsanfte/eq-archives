I was in the Great Divide hunting solo and started off by killing a few of
these Tizmak Warriors. I suddenly realized that they weren't actually
hostile toward me. I even went as far as medding right at the feet of one of
them and it never bothered me. I hailed it and I got the message that it
Gurgled something and nodded it's head at me. My character is a Wood Elf
Druid.

My question is, Does anyone know if the Tizmak Faction can be built up like
others, or is this just strange coincidence?
