Totally agree on the sentiment on BF1942.  What I would love to see is a
combo of CoD and BF1942.  The detail of shooting (let's face it, sniping in
BF is a bit odd sometimes, while in CoD it rules once you get the hang of
the realistic floating site) and the strategy and teamplay of BF1942.

We play both games at LAN parties on the weekends every now and again, and
both are quite fun.

And yes, BF1942 is an awesome game even if you do suck at it.  LOL
