Supposedly every time.

The problem I see with spdat parsers is that there's really no telling
what other hooks the software has in place for determining this
type of data.   Unless you go nuke spiderlings or orc pawns, you get
some resists, etc etc etc.

No idea, but look at the casting time.   It actually notes the new,
improved time when you're wearing the item, so I'd assume it
works every time.    As far as messages go, who knows?  Maybe
the client/server is smart enough not to flood data?

You begin to cast Ice Comet.
Your Bracelet of Quick Hand Waving begins to glow...
Your Tyson's Fist Amulet begins to glow...
Your Mirrored Earring of Objects are Closer than They Appear
begins to glow...
Your KMart Saver's Earring begins to glow...

etc etc etc etc etc etc...

A fully-equipped, upper-level caster would pick up tons of spam from
just the items at times, I'd think.   One of the manaburn wizards on
Zeb was buying just about any III item he could find last night, for
instance.   (And, since they're farming Kunark dragons, he's certainly
got the money to do so...)
