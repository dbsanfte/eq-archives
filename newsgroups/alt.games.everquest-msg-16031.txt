perhaps hiding is was a bad word.  i did not mean it in that context.  i
should've meant to say play in a pk-free environment.  pvp is not even the
correct word since ganking is not really pvp (unless it is a guild war), but
rather pk and grief playing.  i had no intentions of meaning PvE players are
subhuman or cowards.  afterall, i play on erollisi marr, don't i?  i'd be
insulting myself.  sorry for the misunderstanding. :P

You are acting as if I am putting down PvE players and I am not.  I never
even mentioned anything bad about them.  I simply said that the future
market is gravitating towards PvP and that it is my belief that the majority
of players will soon lean in that direction as well.  My opinions seem have
strong backing as you can see every upcoming MMORPG is supporting PvP as a
major part of their games.  I never stated what you personally like or
dislike in a game, nor put down any players that like to sit back and hunt
monsters.  I also believe you are making ganking out to be much worse than
an issue then it really is.

I don't know.  From my experience playing UO, AC, EQ... I'd rank EQ on the
bottom of the scale as far as maturity goes thus far.  It really goes like
this though.  Most mature = Asherons Call..... BIG HUGE GAP.... UO....TINY
GAP.... EQ.  I never really compare EQ to Q2, Q3, Tribes,etc.  Not much into
FPS. :)

Sure there will be grief groups out there.  But just like in UO and any
other game, they will get what they deserve.  I generally play an ANTI-PK
and have a blast hunting em down in MMOG's.  I never said you have to like
the same things as I do.  I encourage you to play as you wish and what you
wish.  Like I said, I was just making general predictions based upon my
beliefs on where the market and genre is heading.  I am sure there will be
great amount of players who want nothing more than to be left alone and
battle mobs and that is perfectly fine.  If I had a problem with that, I
don't think I'd be playing EQ at all, would I?  I don't really think every
MMOG has claimed they'd be different.  And obviously none of them have
succeeded because none of them have been released yet.  But we will start to
learn in a week or two when AO is out and see if they succeed or not.  I'd
also like to point out that a previous poster was correct when he said none
of the upcoming MMORPG's with the exception of SB provide forced pvp.  It
sounds quite easy to avoid it in the others and seems to be given equal or
lesser weight than the PvE aspect.  I really don't see PvP taking hold
strongly until 3rd generation of MMORPGs.
