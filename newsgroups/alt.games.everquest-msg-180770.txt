G'day all,

Recently got an Ashenbone Shield (nodrop 25AC and 100hp) in a raid I
stumbled on in kith... i was the only SK so i got the SK nodrop item :)

Anyway, my 1H slashing skill is 85 or so, along with bash, so its not tooo
far behind to bring up, the problem i have is that I don't have a decent 1H
weapon. My current 2hander is a weighty polearm, which was a great buy at
250pp ;). My pally friend has forked out for a mace of the fallen crusader
and I cant find any SK 1H weapons that come close to its ratio for anything
near the price. Everything is like 9-12dmg, early to late 20's delay or
worse...

Are there any out there that cut the mustard and might be worth the trouble
getting? Or should I just give up on it, stick to 2h and let my uber shield
go to waste? :(
