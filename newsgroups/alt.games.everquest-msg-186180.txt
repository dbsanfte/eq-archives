Whilst just about everyone will proffess to be attracted to all sorts of
noble traits I reckon a safer bet is to rely on peoples complete and utter
shallowness. You get dissapointed less that way...

For a bloke: study hard and get a well paying stable job. Be well groomed
and above all hygenic. Dress well. Don't be an asshole if you you have any
measure of self control.

Also - think in business terms as relationships at it's lowest level are
marketplaces, subject to the same laws of supply and demand as any other
business. You yourself are the product. Not selling well? Well - either
change the product (yourself) or find a market where you will perform
better. Not all cultures value the same thing.
