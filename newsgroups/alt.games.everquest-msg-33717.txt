Ah some player here mentioned something about faction cap
message and someone else said you have no way of 
knowing, now i see what first player was talking about.
Evidently it was in the patch message but:

"FACTION CAP MESSAGES

As many have already noticed, the faction cap messages have not been
appearing since the last patch. Absor posted to the Developer's Corner
with an explanation of this anomoly: 

At this time faction cap messages are broken. Players that are at
their cap (either low or high) are not getting a message telling them
that their faction cannot be raised/lowered. The caps are still in
place and everything is working as normal. No caps were changed. It's
just the messages that are broken. We should have this fixed with the
next patch.
