No need to thank me, I just followed directions. Thank Verant for finally
doing something RIGHT about quests. I would never have thougth to hail Voleen
or Karn if I had not read the newspaper. And according to another source, the
same muffin quest is given out by the merchants in "the inn in North
Freeport." I have no idea who exactly gives it, or whether that person gives
the same "pick up bread" quest. If so, I expect a LOT more money for trotting
(ok, well, porting) to SK to fetch it than a measly 13gp. Will investigate
this after work today.

/em wonders if the allegedly many "still undiscovered" quests might be
revealed some day.
