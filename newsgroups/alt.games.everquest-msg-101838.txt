It's nothing to do with your system, that's just network lag. The EQ 
server tells your system that the mob is near you, your client draws it 
there for a bit, you lose a bunch of packets that contain the information 
that the mob has started running and, after a while, the server tells 
your client that the mob is actually a few yards away. There is nothing 
you can do about this other than getting a better connection, although 
perhaps turning off the firewall when you play may help.
