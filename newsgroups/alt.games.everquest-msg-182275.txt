Another reason to stick near the Sanctus zone - The only KOS mobs in
the zone (aside from the other set of humans aside from the guards
that wander the zones, but those are only KOS if you hunt them too
long), the guards will clean up without bothering any of the other
types you happen to have pulled. True, the mobs are high HP and loot
sucks, but it's a quiet zone and fairly easy pulling.
