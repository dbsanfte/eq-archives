    Or thought out, perfectly valid BUT dissagree with most people in here,
hence gaining mucho agro from the nerdy flame types, as well as some
excellently reasoned arguments from all (including the nerdy flame types)

    The really funny part is... I'd bet my goranga idol that the
overwhelming proportion of people flinging mud at KEI in this thread
*regularly* use it and would be dissapointed if it got nerfed :)

    Tho i do agree it can be used as a crutch to let people do easy things
with no effort, it can *also* be used to let people with a bit more
imagination do otherwise impossible or non-viable things, and that's what
makes it cool. Anything that opens the way for another possible tactic gets
the thumbs up from me... so long as it's not ridiculously powerful, which
KEI certainly isn't for me.

Cheers,
James
