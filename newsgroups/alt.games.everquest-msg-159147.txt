I was looking over some of the spell changes on Lucy and noticed that
they've added level limits to the Lull line as well as Harmony.

I see the effect of Pacify (the best Lull available to my Paladin at
54) listed as 1/55 (reduce frenzy radius to 1, level cap 55) which
could actually prove very useful, especially if the classification
of "beneficial" means that it won't cause agro when resisted.

Another thing that jumped out at me was the level limit on Soothe,
the click effect on the DW Vambraces which is not usable until L45,
which is 40.  So they've made a nearly useless effect completely
useless (I know, useless effects are not rare on Kunark class armor),
well unless you want to pull with it, but the Stun on the bracer
seems to work a lot better for that.
