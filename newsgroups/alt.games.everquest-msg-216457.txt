*chew lip and read that 3 times*

So, err, I'm confused...are you arguing that your DPS is greater than a
ranger's or druid's (or paladins...I forgot earlier they could root), or
did you just see "shaman DPS" and feel like sharing?  

Mind you, nothing against sharing...I'm just not sure if you are
disagreeing that your DPS is probably the least of the
"fast-aggro-grabbing, can-take-a-pounding root mezzers". My husband
contributes a good chunk of damage to our duos through his poison DoT,
rain spells, and velium strike (now that he has an item with anger of e'ci
I get to hear happy giggles...1000+ nukes makes baby Cazic Thule smile).  
Nonetheless, my DPS is still better than his, so it's smarter to let him
do the rooting.
