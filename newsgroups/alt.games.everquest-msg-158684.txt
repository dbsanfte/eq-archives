Think of them as "keys" that give you access to certain planes,
locked doors, or quests which you couldn't access without the flag.

Looked at another way, they're "marks in your permanent record".
Let's say you do a quest that helps NPC Soandso rescue their brother.
The flag you get as a reward is a remembrance of your deed,
so the next time you run into an NPC allied with Soandso, they
say to themselves, "hey, there's that guy that helped Soandso,
we'll give him extra special treatment" (like letting you do
special quests with them, opening locked doors for you, etc.)


>and also, how do i get into other planes besides pod pon poi and poj?

You get into PoV by completing a test of battle in PoJ.  Not sure
about the rest.
