I've never understood WHY people bitch about down-time?  I can see if
something goes wrong and the whole infrastructure goes down and things BLOW
UP and everybody is fucked -- yeah.  I can see bitching then.  But... you're
right.  it's all scheduled, the down-time is minimal (it's not like the
verant guys are sitting around eating pizza and playing tony hawke or
something while they're supposed to be working...) and it's back up in no
time flat.  Are people actually THAT addicted that they can't deal with two
hours of downtime?  uh... sad!  heh.
