I love MS,personally.  :)
All my Alts go there at level 20 and stay there until Rockhoppers turn
green (around lvl 30).
Nearly every Rockhopper drops a "Greyhopper Hide" or a "Low-Quality-
Rockhopper Hide".
Staying there from 20 to 30 nets around 300 LQ-Hides,if you planned 
ahead from the start,you will spend levels 1 to 7 in Shadeweaver for
Shadeling silk.
Combine Shadeling silk with LQ-Hides for leather paddings,going
price on SolRo is 40 p per padding,300 *40p=12000p,not bad for
a level 30 char.
And dont hunt at the so called "Rock"- spot,entrance to Seru
is safe,and as a "good" class you can bank in Seru.

Oh and it never rains in Southern California,ahem in MS.  :)
