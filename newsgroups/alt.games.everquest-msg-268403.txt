An "ok level" seems to imply that leveling is important to you. I have
been playing since the second week, casual at best, and I just left
n00b isle yesterday. My level max'd a few days ago (pre citizen
cap)and my artisan capped at level 9, 10 impending.

Just because the game says you can leave, or do this or that, doesn't
mean it is in your character's best interest to do so. I stayed around
n00b isle because I wanted to max my artisan skills. Being on n00b
isle made maxxing it easy because I knew where the resources spawned
and I knew what named dropped items that I could sell to the merchants
for money to fund my artisan crafting. By the time I left yesterday, I
had lots of backpacks, all my app 3 spells, and a minor armor upgrade.

If getting to the next zone that offers the best exp is your forte;
well then you'll have little time for much else than your main.One
thing I did notice was that with artisan crafting, you have moments
where you push all the right keys and things still go wrong (less than
pristine) and have it do so two times in a row. So god help those who
figure they'll go back and do this later when this is all they focus
on. I try to at least keep artisan and class levels pretty much at
parity. Keeps the frustration/burn out level low.

So it's not that there isn't time, it's just how you use the time you
have. EQ1 taught me that class leveling as an "ends" is an endless
treadmill leading to burn out if that is all you focus on. Slow down,
enjoy the game, explore the zones, see what trinkets you can make,
ect...
