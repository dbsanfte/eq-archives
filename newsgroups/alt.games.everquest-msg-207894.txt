Since I spent my entire weekend in Charasis, I thought I would do a
follow-up to share my experiences. :)

So far I've seen that the West Wing boss is always on track, but the North
Wing boss was something we had to camp.

*grin* Or have a map that shows you which rugs are bad...some rugs are
really hard to not step on, so it was good to know they were safe.

Actually, at level 60 I pulled him single with snare without a hitch.

Correct on all accounts.

I agree on there not being a safe spot in North or West.  In the North
Wing I found it was fairly easy to just sit in the last place we
slaughtered, such that I felt I was in a perpetual safe spot. The West
wing was more hairy...but eventually I found one place in a hall where
there was only one wanderer to worry about.  

In the south wing I believe the "cave" hallway only has one wanderer, so
that was a nice place to sit.
 
But yes, the upshot of our adventure was that we could duo the north and
west wings with confidence.  Once I had the south wing key I found I could
single pull mobs from that first room before the one-way wall without
trouble, though rak's 38th level pet had to be left out of the picture due
to low level aggro.  

We got to 61 (starting at 0 xp when we hit charasis) in a very short
time. The experience there is staggeringly good for LB/DB mix of mobs
that, beyond the HT, are pretty wimpy.

Now that we have turned 61 and we have  58th level shaman pet and his
25hp/tick regen spell, I'm fairly confident we can duo the South Wing with
impunity.  I got to experience part of it witha  larger group that didn't
seem to care about trying to pull singles, and my sense is that assuming
there isn't an aggro issue with me being only 61, I now know the tactics
of pulling single in that zone.  Even if we get 3 at a time, Rak and I
were handling adds of up to 5 or so in the West wing (though it got a
little hairy when they all look the same, so Rak wasn't sure which one he
had put 70% slow on yet), so I think we'll be ok.

Honestly...no more need to duo the east wing. :)  South wing will be fine
for me, now that we have his 7th cudgel taken care of.  Have to say I have
a *serious* love-hate relationship with HS...love the xp and non-crowding,
hate the impending doom of how awful a CR would be.

Inc 62 :) And yes, he has his 7th cudgel now.  We just need to gather up a
good enchanter, a good cleric, and maybe a good tank (I can tank in a
pinch, but I'd prefer not to risk losing the turn-in components for this
event).
