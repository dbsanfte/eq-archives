Hehe no, I have no envy for forced raids/forced attendance.  I mean, wow,
you killed Emporor AGAIN? *yawn* How EXCITING...no, REALLY.  You gathered,
waited an hour to get everything right, and you killed something.

I just can't take raid guilds seriously.  First to see VT...that's
nice...and how is that different than, say, TOV or even Naggy?  What's the
difference between those besides levels?  Why is that exciting?  I just
don't get it.

But that's ok, I'm having a fun time in the game by doing my own thing.

Envy?  No, sorry. :)  The VAST majority of raid guild members bore the shit
outta me with their immaturity.  There's some good ones, but the bad way
outnumber the good.
