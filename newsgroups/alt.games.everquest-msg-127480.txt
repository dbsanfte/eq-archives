 Fixed in what way? Just actually raises you con a level or two?
Shadowhaven faction hasn't really proved to be useful for me. Then
again, faction in all of SoL is pretty much a disaster. I think Verant
got a little carried away with faction thing in SoL. When you kill a mob
you should NOT see 9 faction adjustments. That's just ridiculous.
