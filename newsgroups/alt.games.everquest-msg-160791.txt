There is a newbie quest in Qeynos where you lead a level 1 NPC Monk
back to the guild in town. When you go through the dialogue to get him
to follow you, he becomes your "pet". Before the patch that changed
the warders I buffed him with my 39 Pet buff, SoW, Spirit of Inferno
(fire based process), Dex, and strength. I then zoned out to release
him back into the "wild"......

He doesn't agro on players (just gnolls)...

Poor Fippy never had a chance heheh :)
