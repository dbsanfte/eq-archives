At least he's got a decent reason, as opposed to the people that I did my
corrupted seahorse with (yes, a pickup group in Kedge, wtf) who wanted GM
rezzes because the corrupted spawned through the ceiling to a different part
of the zone (it hadn't agro'd us at this point), and when we tried to kill
it there, 4 of our 6 members died.  THEN, we went and killed a tainted
seahorse while the corrupted was up... no corrupted spawned, gj morons.  I
ended up pulling the corrupted to the zone in and we killed it with only us
2 survivors and a 58 wizard who was coming to join the Phinny feeding. (I
have NO idea how I pulled it, all I was trying to do was get a fish at the
bottom of the main tube to the zone in, the corrupted was just outside
Cauldronboils room where we got owned, thx bot wizard doing Supernova
instead of Evacuate.)
