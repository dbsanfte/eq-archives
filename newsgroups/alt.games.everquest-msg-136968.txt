No prob.  You can also look up Library Of Parliament publication
BP149e (1997 rev.) which explain Section 33, its intended uses, and
some pro/con arguements for its existance.

As you point out "affirmative action" and anti-discrimination laws are
two different concepts.   Funny how such a recent document still dates
itself, though.  Never mind the margin note, they also use the term
"disability".

I agree with your concerns about 15(2), but I also see some need for a
similar clause, and honestly don't know how else it could be worded.
You wouldn't want a school for the visually impaired, for example, to
be accused of discrimination against the sighted.

Pretty much my feelings.   The document was created in politically
turbulent times, and 33 was very much a compromise.  Then Prime
Minister Trudeau was reluctant to approve, although he softened his
stance later.

Hmm, another tongue-in-cheek observation:

US- a collection of states each doing their own thing, with a central
government also doing its own thing.
Canada- a collection of provinces each being a busybody about the
other provinces' business, with a central government trying to
micro-manage everything but pay for nothing
