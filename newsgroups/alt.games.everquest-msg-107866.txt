Vambraces:  19 AC +35 HP +3 DEX +2 WIS

This is a bit of a dissapointment, less AC than Donals and no clickable
effect at all?  In exchange for 35 HP (not as much as any single blow
from
any mob thats hit me in ten levels) 3 Dex (what am I going to do with
Dex?)
and 2 wis.. which translates to 10 mana as my wis is already over 200
even
without the inevitable wis buff included in C3 or slapped on by more
pedestrian
chanters trying to make good.  Ooh, where I was once totally OOM, now
I'll be able to cast DA.

Thurg quest legs were so good I really expected these to be at least
halfway
decent... now I'm thinking of MQing the quest to a guildmate who might
get
better stats with their class.

greaves:  7 WT, 24 AC, +40 MANA, +80 HP, +10 WIS, +3 SV COLD,
EFF: WORD OF HEALTH

Are any of the Plate class thurg quest arms actually desirable?
