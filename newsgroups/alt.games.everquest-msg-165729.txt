While the 11/18 seems massive, and the 21/18 seems outrageous, the key to this
weapon is the proc.  Proc rate on the hammer of judgement is insane compared to
any other weapon in the game.  Proc rate gets higher on the higher level
hammers.  As you face higher and higher level mobs, your capped out weapon skills
mean fewer and fewer hits, but the proc goes off on its own timer/RNG regardless
of whether you are hitting or not, regardless of how much damage you are doing.
60+, you can pretty much ignore your melee damage output, its ALL about the
procs.

This being the case, you want to cap out your dex.  Luckily, Yaulp V, the other
necessary compontent for cleric melee, boosts your dex by around 75 points, and
the hammer itself has 25 dex on it as you can see above.  Get Focus whenever you
have POTC on (POTC/Focus/Symbol is more HP than Aego+BAOR, and same mana regen),
and there's another shaman buff that stacks and takes your dex even higher.

You also want all the haste you can get.  YV is a 25% haste, and wearable 22%
haste in the form of SCHW is cheap to get, but you should keep your eyes open for
upgrades to haste equipment that are cleric compatible (SBOC is actually less
haste, but only marginally and better cleric stats, Shroud of the Dar Brood is a
nice upgrade to haste that's also pretty nice for a non combat cleric, etc.)
Caster haste will increase your swing rate dramatically, though, SOS off chanter
epic doesn't even cost anyone mana, or higher level hastes like VoG and SoV have
long enough durations that most chanters will see the advantage to keeping it on
you if you are tanking.

Your damage rate comes directly off your dex and haste and level of your hammer,
as its these three things that affect your proc rate.  Your melee damage will
also be fairly impressive against blue mobs while you are in your 50s, but you'll
actually be doing less damage this way on higher level mobs, while their HP
totals skyrocket.  Over 60, the rate at which mobs become "green" goes thru the
roof, so that you lose the option of going after mobs on which your melee output
matters.

Oh, and the proc is irresistable.  If it wasn't, this might fall into the
category of amusing toys.
