If I had the OP's dilemma, which of course, I once did, I would not take that 
as proof.  After all, the price not changing could mean that when you add to 
the stack, it changes it from selling 3 LPs for 20pp to selling 17 LPs for 
20pp.  Joy, I'd still be screwed.  Thank goodness they actually made it work 
in a sensible way.  Given Verant/SOE's past history, though, I'd never count 
on them to have made it work in a sensible way.
