First of all, what kind of Internet connection do you have? If you are
using a 56K, you will experience lag. That's just the nature of the
beast. High-speed internet is becoming more and more "mainstream" and
therefor alot of the online gameplay is going to require more and more
bandwidth conspumption. That's not to say a person using a dial-up
connection will not be able to play the said game, but that person
will have lag. Once again, it's the nature of the beast. While I am
sure that Verant does everything they can to reduce the lag, they
cannot completely eridicate it. Especially when there may be thousands
upon thousands of people on the same server/network.

When I first started to play EQ, I was on a dial-up connection and
yes, at times the lag was almost un-bearable, but since I went to a
cable-connection, the lag has been very minimal.
