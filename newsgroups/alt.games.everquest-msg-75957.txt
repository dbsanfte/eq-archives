So I ported into BB, and saw on tracking that the shore dwarves were
up  I shouted camp check, no replies while I cast wolf form and medded
up.  By the time I had all three snared, a druid shouts "Shore is
camp, I'm sorry".  Then "Dang it, I go afk and someone takes my
spawns".  Now, this was at night, and you probably know about the bug
with wolf form where druids often appear as tiny black wolves. I would
have not taken them if I had seen him sitting there.  What was I
supposed to do since  had already engaged them?    

Afterwards, I get a tell "I appreciate your taking my spawn, I was afk
making breakfast".   Now, this isn't the first time I had druids who
were mysteriously afk while the shore dwarves were up and then get mad
when I "take the spawn"  Most likely those druids were  off killing
the dock dwarves.  

Anyhow, being a rude druid myself, I said "no problem", greeting
sarcasm with sarcasm.  He pitied my guild, said that he had a family
to make breakfast for (like I don't have that problem(?)).   I
commented how the druid campers were so rude here and explained that I
did not see him there.  He said the rudeness was called for (towards
me) since I had run right by him to take his spawns (after I already
said I didn't see him)  Then he said to take the "freaken camp".  

After I medded back to full I just left.   [Question:  what would you
have done in my situation?  Bitten back and stayed,  reluctantly give
in seeing as how he was probably there, or be good natured].  In the
past I wouldn't have sarscastically said "no probem" but I'm tired of
explaining to druids,  "well gee I didn't see you there and the spawns
were just sitting there for a few minutes".  But I don't feel the need
to apologize.   

Other druids have come by after I killed the shore dwarves (and I did
the camp check) saying they had been camping these dwarves for the
last 3 hours and that I should leave.  These are the druids who are
also holding the docks but due to medding must wait several minutes
after they spawn before engaging.  

Unfortunately, my druid  turned evil and I just use her to (slowly)
make pp for my alt.  Myself a druid, I am losing respect for druids in
general.  But to be fair, maybe most players get uptight in higher
levels.
