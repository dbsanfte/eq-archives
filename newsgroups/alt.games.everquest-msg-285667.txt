	Kurns->Unrest->Veksar ?

	There's a little bit of a gap between Unrest and Veksar where
it's hard to find high concentrations of non-runners...  Echo Caverns
(undead miners) or the druid port in in FV spring to mind but it's too
easy to clear all the mobs. TOFS, maybe?

	I once got a lot of mileage out of the skeletons in ME, near the
vampire forts.
