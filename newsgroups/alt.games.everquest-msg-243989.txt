I exaggerated somewhat. Revise 'uber endgame' to the wordier but more 
accurate 'well travelled 65th with a large number of raids under their 
belt' (and an FT priority).

Even so... Raid (Itraer Vius), Raid (Itraer Vius), Raid (Tormax), Raid 
(Brynju), Probably a Raid for Coldain Shawl not to mention lengthy 
quest, Solstice is just cash, and LDoN of course is 1 groupable. As you 
say very doable, and yeah, its not endgame, but its definately high game.
