I just discovered a great spot. The poacher camp in Jagged Pine Forest. It's
a bit late for my level 53 druid, as about half the mobs are light blue, but
it could be what you are looking for. No casters (I think they are all
rogues). Easy to single pull. Loot is not great, but they do drop quality
pelts of all types, so if you are into the leather padding thing it could be
really productive. As a troll your faction with the Jagged Pine folk would
probably be bad, but you get positive faction with each kill, so you should
soon be able to buy, sell and bank in the same zone. If you stand by the
river and pull from the tents nothing paths there that I've seen. Good luck.
