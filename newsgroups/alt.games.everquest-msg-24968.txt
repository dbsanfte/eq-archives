Part of the problem for me is just the general lack of realism. How
can you convince yourself you're in an alternate world, when even the
smallest details don't feel convincing? Even the shops aren't useable
much of the time.... when did you last by armour or a weapon from a
merchant?

And as for the world not changing.....

I used this example a long time ago in this newsgroup, but here it is
again:

Say I've just crossed the continent from Freeport to Qeynos, after an
extended absence. I meet another character along the way, and I'm in
this for roleplaying, so I ask him "what news of the struggle against
the gnolls in Blackburrow my friend?". Well, I already know the
answer, don't I? Nothing has changed. Gnolls still spawn. People still
kill them. They can NEVER be permanently banished. Now, he can
"roleplay" by telling me something like "the heroic struggle goes on,
blah blah", but essentially, it's a load of crap that he's just making
up for the sake of roleplaying. He can't reply in any meaningful way.

Now, I'm not blaming Verant for this. To be fair, I think it'd be very
difficult to create an MMORPG where the world was dynamic enough for
roleplaying to work properly. I mean, no-one permanently dying (I can
spell it too!) is kind of a serious obstacle to realism. How could you
have a realistic struggle between two opposing forces, for example,
when each side permanently re-spawns?

Kithicor, Runnyeye, and Befallen are the exceptions, not the rule, and
don't in themselves make for a dynamic game.

If you can roleplay in the environment of EQ, and have fun, then go
for it. It's just that personally, I can't really see the point.
