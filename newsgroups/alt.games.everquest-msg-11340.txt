My wife uses both the button and the hot key with her ranger, and I've
seen other people do it too.  Now I'll have to ask her why :)

Maybe the answer is so that they can see it cycle.  The button greys out
after they make a melee attack.  During that delay they might want to do
something else.  This is especially important for clerics that would
want to med between melee attacks, or hybrids that might want to cast or
shoot arrows.  The flicker of the button is a good indicator of how
often they attack if they have their own misses turned off too.  

I could be wrong of course, I haven't played with this much.  Maybe they
just like buttons.
