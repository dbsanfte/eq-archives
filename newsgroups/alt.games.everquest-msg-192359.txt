Here's what I found on www.everquest.com

   1. Run testeverquest.exe
   2. Do NOT click "Play"
   3. Exit testeverquest.exe
   4. Go to your EQ folder and copy EQMAIN.DLL to your
      desktop (or anywhere "safe" where it won't be overwritten).
      It should be dated 04/10/03.
   5. Run Everquest
   6. Wait until it finishes patching and DO NOT click "Play."
   7. Copy the EQMAIN.DLL you saved off in step 4 to your Everquest
      folder.
   8. Now, click "Play" on the Evequest patcher and log in.

At this point, I've had success by:

   a. Going into "Chat"
   b. Selecting "Play" (or "Join" or whatever it is to get in) from
      there.

The TestEverquest.exe definitely downloads a different EQMAIN.DLL
than the Everquest patcher.  (The testeverquest.exe DLL is dated
04/10/03, as stated before, and the Everquest patcher downloads a
DLL that is dated 04/08/03.)

This worked for me, it might work for you as well.
