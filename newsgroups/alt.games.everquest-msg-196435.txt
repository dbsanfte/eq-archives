That's what I've heard (errr... read). It used to be a great place to level.
Unfortunately, I've just recently (a month or two now) started playing EQ
and it seems like everyone and their brother is there trying to level and
many of them are immature punks.

On the other hand, Crushbone doesn't seem so bad now. I first went there not
long after I started the game and found it to be a chaotic mess like PC is
now. It doesn't seem so bad now. Do these zone go through cycles?
