	The being you are describing is no god.  He can be wrong.  There are
limits to his powers, there are things he can't do.  He's bigger and stronger
and smarter than me, but that doesn't make him god, and it sure doesn't make
him a supreme moral authority.

	If you use the Upper Case you are invoking a presumption that you are
discussing the deity commonly so addressed in our culture.
