I just downloaded instructions to get an incandesent wand. I read a lot of
notes sayin' it was a boken quest, I was wondering if it had been fixed yet?
I am about to quest for this item ( a little out of order ) My plan was to
goto Unrest first, get the silver powder, then move on to the rest of the
quest. However it makes no sence to do so if it won't work, or if the quest
has been removed?
