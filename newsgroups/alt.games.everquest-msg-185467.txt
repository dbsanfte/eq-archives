I am not 100% certain on this, but I have heard people speaking out of
character and I believe the twigs are found on the ground in either Greater
Faydark or Lesser Faydark.  I've picked up a few things from the ground
though and have yet to get a twig.  Seeing they are called "Faydark Twigs"
though, that would make sense.
