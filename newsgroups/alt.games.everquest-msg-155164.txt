Well, dwarves can't be wizards.  It'd be "in character" for DEs to kill
him.  Gnomes are also popular and could RP tension between Gnomes and
the "lesser" Brell race.  Erudians could RP something as well, as could
humans.  The only wizard race that would have to "reach" to kill dwarves
are the high elves, and even that's certainly something that can be RP'd.
