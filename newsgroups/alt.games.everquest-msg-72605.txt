Well, not always.

Melee alone maybe, but I managed to porcupine pretty well through level 47.
Most of the MOBs I fought were HG's and Bloodgill goblins - maybe not the
toughest MOBs, but good exp for 47. I averaged 20 pts every 3 secs with my
Dark Ember (From log files), or about 2/3 of a Drifting Death. Coupled with
with a DS (around 50-60pts every 3 secs) and Chloroplast, it seemed pretty
effective for solid Blue MOBs.

Of course mid 50's may be entirely different, but porcupining and melee
still have their place through the 40's for single, non-spectacular MOBs.

BTW, hit percentage with 200 offense, 167 1HB is 65% (from log files). I'm
not saying Druids should (or can) tank, but porcupining still has a place in
situations.
