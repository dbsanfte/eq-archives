Awww... Fabno is cheesed off that I insulted OS because his character
is ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED there and he always gets a group.

Glad you enjoy it so much, but if you step back and look at it, 
it's the same old shit as Lower Guk and so on.  Just as you are
the SAME old shit that you were at level 1.  Sure you've got a
few more trick and a few more hit points... well, the frogs in OS
have a few more tricks (summoning, increased agro radius and
they hit FUCKING hard) and they have a LOT more hit point.
With your little pet, you could solo the frogs in the Qeynos sewers
and in Innothule and in the entrance of Upper Guk.  After that,
you needed a crew.  The reason for this is because, while you
got stronger, the NPCs got ALOT stronger.  So much so that
fighting an "even" con mob at your level is an exercise that
requires multiple high-level crews.  Really, though, if you 
get down to brass-tacks, it's all the same and you could have
saved yourself a lot of time and effort if you'd simply quit at
level 20 when you could still solo even-con frogs.  At least
then you'd feel like you were still pretty strong relative to 
the mobs.  It's kinda like those fire beetles (Klickniks and
Klacknaks) that you cut your teeth on.  Is there much 
difference between those and a Lava Duct Crawler in
Sol B?  The LDCs have more hits, hit a LOT hard and
are generally a pain in the ass.  You get slightly more loot
from an LDC than from a fire beetle.  But... I thought the
point of gaining levels and going to new places was to
actually SEE SOMETHING NEW.  Largers Kobolds and
fire beetles on steroids isn't exactly what I had in mind.
Undead Frogloks which are simply redressed Frogloks
which are crap that I fought in the Qeynos sewers at
level 6 hard qualifies either.  If you're having fun,
however, then knock yourself out.
