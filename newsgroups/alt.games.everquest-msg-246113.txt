Yes, this is your best bet. /target, while better than mouse-targetting, is 
not as good (or fast!) as the F keys. Be careful, though- hit the F-key 
twice and you will target the players pet. This has the added advantage 
that you can quickly target your group and do something *other* than the 
one spell you plan on using(like LoH for example).

That won't work. %t interprets as "the name of whatever I have targeted"(so 
it won't switch targets) *and* it interprets with lower precedence than any  
other operator in the script, meaning that it is replaced with orc_pawn_01 
*after* the command takes place. Do a /w all %t some time to see what I 
mean.

It *is* useful to have a macro for a healing spell. Mine look a bit like 
this (as a cleric):

/sit off
/g Incoming (( NameOfHeal )) for (( %t )), x seconds, yyyyHP 
/cast 1
/cast 1
/cast 1

This will stand you up if you are seated, let the other healers in the 
group know what you are doing, then cast the spell. The reason it has three 
cast commands is to gloss over fizzles- if you use this macro a fizzle only 
adds like a quarter second to your casting time.
