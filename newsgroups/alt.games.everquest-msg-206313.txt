Well currently, maybe not.  But if you are in a major raiding guild you are
well up on the self-improvement thing.  That includes planning ahead for
maximum efficiency sooner rather than later.

Also as an elemental flagged character he can make an astronomical amount of
AA's in a very short time

Well it keeps Virtue up longer, BoR longer, it makes elixir heal for even
longer - I'd say thats spells clerics cast continously, not on a daily basis
but on an hour, even minutetly basis.

Slightly different for shamans, in that their LoY spell is already group
based.
On the cleric and shaman I found RC1 to be only a minor bonus in PoE exp
groups (it would clear malo, but not the trees snare etc) - rc3 is the shit
though.

No wonder he has so few AA's if he solos!

With a monk or ranger, you could of duod the lot in a fraction of the time,
for better exp/hour i bet =p

Har har!  Actually this time we didn't lose any clerics to them. Just our
