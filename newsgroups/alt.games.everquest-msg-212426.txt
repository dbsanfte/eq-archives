Yeah. It is a matter of perspective. Most of us will never be able to
say we suffered more than a part of God did. "Were you ever nailed to
a tree for three days, dying while having your arms slowly unsocket
themselves?" 

"well.. uh.. no..."

"I did that for you."

It is really all about free will, otherwise it would be a puppet show.
Its sort of like if you could magically wave your wand and have a
perfect child who never did anything wrong, never had to be taught
anything, never grew up to be something bad, would you? Would you
rather have this perfect robot or a child you raised from birth, who
was a mystery?

I always think that misery and toil are things which cause us to
search. All of these bad things are also hints that nature is
corrupted, since the fall. 

The long time period is to teach everyone that Lucifer and one third
of the heavenly host was clueless. If Lucifer led a rebellion, then
was simply wiped out with the wave of a hand, the other angels may
have said "Hey, maybe that Lucifer guy was on to something and God was
afraid?" Instead he was given a very long time to work his will and
give it the best shot he could. Meanwhile the whole of nature is
corrupted since the fall leading some to believe that there must not
be a God, while others believe that there has to be a God. Basically
they believe different things for the same reasons.
