It is your god that causes the fair wimps to despise thee, and not thy 
race. See how they tremble in fear!

The only necromancers that have a God that is such a joke that the 
lighties don't care too much about them are those gnomes who follow 
Bertoxx. Perhaps it is because Disease is not as feared as Hatred and 
Fear itself. Perhaps it is because gnomes are just so tasty and fun to 
punt. Regardless, gnomes are welcome in most of the places the other 
necromancers are not.

I have found few differences in faction between evil Erudites and Dark 
elves.
