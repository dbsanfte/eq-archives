Hitting 24 yesterday, my little gnome SK finally got Feign Death.  I've 
never really used this much in the past, I had a necro who got the spell 
even earlier, but didn't need it very often, and my only foray into monk 
never reached that high level... my long term partner in crime played a 
monk up to 30 or so, and so I got a feel for how it worked from 
discussing it with her, but of course monk FD is a skill, which meant 
constant labor trying to get the skill up to par, and it was hard for me 
to tell the difference between FD problems and her skill problems.


So, armed with the spell version, I tried it a couple times and 
determined that I was in a desperate skill situation of my own; 
foolishly, I'd spent a bunch of time working on Divination and 
Alteration, when Abjuration was needed for FD!

Well, I broke down and went the POK route, chain casting Endure Cold 
till OOM, then medding it back up to repeat.  I got a C1 at one point, 
and kept at it so long that that wore off.  I got a mod rod when someone 
mass rodded, and used all three charges.  Finally got my abj skill up to 
around 111, not quite as high as possible for my level, and decided 
"good enough".

So I ran off on a grand adventure, book to GD, run over to EW and then 
to the Rygorr fort, planning to go in to CC.

Well, on arrival outside the fort, I stopped to take stock of my 
situation, and discovered that a manticore was pursuing me.  I fizzled 
FD, then channeled it thru a few hits, whereupon my pet proceded to get 
pounded into mush, then the 'Core wandered off, forgetting all about me.

I stood up, cast another pet, and sat down to regen hp; FD hp regen is 
the same as standing, painfully slow, and you can't use bandages.  I'm 
considering how best to go about getting in to the caverns themselves, 
when I'm jumped by the RyGorr Messenger.  I can't get FD off, I manage 
to stick a fear to him, he runs off, I FD, he eats my pet and then comes 
back and finishes me off.  Apparantly, just casting the spell 
successfully isn't good enough.

Well, I make another pet using chips from the bank, and come running 
across to get my body.  I'm looting when boom, rygorr messenger again. 
This goes even less well than the first time, without AC or the added HP 
from gear, I'm paste again in short order.

Third time, I don't even bother with the pet, and I drag my body to a 
spot outside the messenger path.  He pops up twice while I'm getting 
myself together again, but now he runs straight in and despawns instead 
of stopping to make a snack out of me.  I consider taking him on, I can 
probably Fear Kite him down with a little luck... but its not my mission.

Instead, I send the pet to attack one of the guards outside the 
entrance, figuring both will aggro on him and I'll run past the fight 
for the entrance.  This doesn't work out, he gets the one mob single and 
the other just stands there; he's fading fast though, so I go for the 
run anyway.  Other guard aggros, but I'm past him, and I just keep 
running, looping around to minimize adds... unsuccessfully, I pick up at 
least one, an oracle, who hits me with Malaise before I manage to open 
the gate and go in and hit the crystal ball.  Pet dies somewhere in the 
run.

I try and cure disease the malaise away, but either its not a disease at 
all, or I just don't cast enough times to clear it, it doesn't really 
worry me much anyway, as I don't have good resists to begin with.

Anyway, on with the effort. First, I take out the miner at the top of 
the tunnel.  Yellow to me, I take him down at the cost of half my health 
and some of my mana, particularly worrying is the fact that he runs 
early enough that Clinging Darkness doesn't slow him down too much, I'm 
concerned that he'll reach help before falling.  But I manage to chew 
him down sufficiently to get him to RIP (Running In Place) before that 
happens.

Next down, though, is certainly beyond me; a watchman and an oracle.  I 
sent the pet at the Oracle and run past the watchman; the pet somehow 
falls into the pit and the oracle takes off after him, I find another 
watchman that was out of my line of sight, both aggro on me, and nearly 
drop me before I get FD off, then they annoyingly stand over top of me. 
    I stand back up and move rapidly a bit further down, only one 
aggros, but I FD again because I see the Oracle running back up to his 
position having polished off my pet somewhere below.  He never sees me, 
and the watchman also wanders back to his post.

Now I stand up and then, clear of aggro, sit back down and bandage up to 
70%, before making a dash for it.  I gather up a little train, half a 
dozen miners and watchmen, before finding another oracle who slaps me 
with a root.  I FD, but its broken because a spell lands on me, 
according to a message I get, so I stand there and cast some Fears until 
FD comes up again and I can drop to the ground.  This time I'm 
successful, and get the pleasure of lying there wondering if the DOTs 
that have landed on me will wear off before I run out of HP.  Three of 
the orcs are still right on top of me, so I'm pretty sure if I stand up 
I'm going to die, wounded as I am, before it does me any good.

Well as luck has it, I did manage to wait out the DOTs, and the root 
wore off and I waited a good long time till I got some HP back too, 
before standing up, dashing forward, and then FDing yet again.  Only one 
of the trio aggroed on me and he wandered off on FD.    SO once again I 
was able to stand, sit, bind wounds back to 70%, rinse and repeat.

I did this a couple more times, reaching about halfway down into the 
pit, but then a non game disaster hit; I was lying there FD taking stock 
of my position when a power blip hit my line.  Well, I lost my UPS a 
couple months back and haven't replaced it yet, so this meant instant crash.

Well, I just quit for the night, I'd gotten some experience with FD, and 
had known anyway that I'd probably end up leaving the body somewhere 
down there in CC.  The character was merely a trial balloon, race and 
class I'm thinking about running on the Combine server, and this little 
excursion struck me as educational and fun, particularly knowing that I 
didn't care how badly it might turn out.
===================================================================
Conclusions:

FD is tricky stuff, prone to failure from many sources, fizzle, mystery 
failure, and caster already started spell.

Mobs don't reliably leave when you FD, either, they may just hang out.

Pets don't FD with you, and so they become extremely disposable, on the 
other hand, they can be used to create openings, aggroing mobs so you 
can run past them, and then FD when the pet dies so as to ditch the 
aggro he created.

Standing up and running, even with mobs standing on top of you, often 
works great; the mobs only check their surroundings occaisionally, I 
suppose sort of like a search light or a radar screen, its possible to 
get out from their sight, or at very least to get far enough ahead that 
you can reach a safe position to FD again.

FD itself sucks, bad HP and mana regen, no bind wounds, no casting, no 
potions... the only thing worse would be Real Death.

At low levels, FD is mana intensive, coupled with the poor mana regen 
while lying doggo, this can make it very time consuming to travel with; 
rogue hide/sneak looks like a great bargain comparatively speaking.

One thing I haven't gotten around to is probably the most popular use of 
FD, splitting mobs.  I understand the basics, but I'll have to actually 
work on the practice; I figured though, that trying to get thru CC was 
throwing myself off the deep end by way of learning to swim!
