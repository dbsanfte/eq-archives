As a Druid 41 with a Tracking skill of 125 I thought I could track corpses
for group members if they were not in the same zone as their corpse.  Last
night a group of us were in the Eastern Wastes and one of our number died
before I invoked Lessor Succor.  Since our slain companion was bound in
Thurgadin, I thought I could track his corpse but sadly I never saw it.
Even when we found it via /locate and I was standing next to it, the corpse
was not on my tracking display.

Do you need to be a Ranger to do this?

Jocund sighs clearly disappointed
