This sounds like a good idea, and one I bet that verant would, or has
considered. It's pretty common to offer discounts for volume
purchases. Verant could sell an EQ version, called family EQ or
somesuch, that came with 5 accounts or something at a reduced price.
Maybe make it so that all 5 accounts have to be paid on same credit
card or something to cut down on abuse.

I think some of your complaints may go away in time, as more and more
massivley multiplayer games hit the market. It looks like the pricing
model is moving towards a blanket subscription that gets you access to
any number of online games offered by a supplier. A company like
Verant needs to do this, otherwise they will just start cannabilizing
their own customer base when they release the Star Wars game, and
other online titles. Very few people are going to pay multiple
subscription fees for multiple online games.
