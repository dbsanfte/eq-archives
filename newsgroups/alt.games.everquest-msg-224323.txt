He's a SK so there's quite a long list of things that can wrong when
trying to get FD off while being pounded by one or more mobs.

-- Spell fizzles
-- Spell is interrupted
-- Mob stuns you at exactly the wrong time
-- FD check itself fails (Blahblah has fallen to the ground)

I never had very much success with FD on my 50-ish Necro [*] while a
mob or mobs was in my face and SKs face similar problems.  One
particular dirtnap on the first floor of Tower of Frozen Shadow still
sticks in my mind 2 years later, I somehow found myself on the slippy
floor section with my pet off somewhere soloing and couldn't get FD
off despite six casting attempts... and when I finally did the
secondary check failed.  Harmshield always worked more effectively
although invariably when I really needed it it wasn't memmed.

[*] The fact that I was crap and in crap gear didn't help.
