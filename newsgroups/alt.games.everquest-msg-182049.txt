Excellent!  I'm glad to hear that it helped.  I figured it
would ;^)

Not totally related but similar, I am amazed to find-out how
many people buy the latest-and-greatest video card and CPU
(spending wads of cash) and then only put 128Mb (or even
64Mb!) into their systems (ie. running a 2+GHz P4 with 64Mb
of RAM).  That's like putting an 800 horsepower racing engine
into a car with a 3 ounce gas tank.

Overall, it is far better to have a "balanced" system rather
than one that is ultra-beefy in one aspect and totally lacking
in another.

Anyway, enjoy your newfound EQ experience!

Mike
