Hi everyone:

It seems I've made an error in judgement - three weeks ago I dinged 61 with
my soling Wizard. Since dinging, experience has become so much of a grind
it's not true. I've made 30% towards 62 in this time, and I enjoy a good
deal of on-line time. I can't really hunt in PoP zones due to tremendous
lag, I find I take one step forward and two back in these zones.

Can someone *please* suggest an area that I might in where the experience
gives at least an AA point a day. In ME I get trained to oblivion, and the
Grey sees very minimal reward for my efforts. Ideally, I'd love to find a
camp such as Nathyn's guards at the Mansion in Katta Castellum - I was
getting one AA in seven hours there - this is acceptable to me.

Are there any guards that are blue to me at 61 and can be single pulled
without causing massive faction problems later on? Nathyn's guards (to the
best of my knowledge) don't have faction that will cause me to regret
hunting there.

I'm hoping to upgrade my PC in the next week or two, but in the meantime
would love to at least get a few AA's. Also, please don't tell me to group,
I soloing is my preference.

Many thanks, and safe hunting to you all.

Stevie.
