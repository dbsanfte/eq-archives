Graeme,
I read this a bit differently.  The higher-level manasongs are also 3 tick
duration instead of instant, and they stack with the Clarity line of buffs.
They don't, however, stack with each other.

The way this looks to me, they're keeping you from getting benefit from more
than one manasong at a time.  You could have one bard doing the AOE manasong
and another bard in-group playing the other and get double the loving.  This
change would shift it so that the bardsongs would not stack, you'd only get
the hugs from the higher-level song.
