That seems to be common behavior for folks like this.
Just a few nights ago I was wandering around Lower Guk
(the spawn I needed for an item drop was camped, so I
was just sightseeing) and killed time hanging around
with a couple of guys who were keeping the AM/hall/Lord
spawns cleaned as fast as they were spawning.  They
let me bonk their mobs for weapon skill increases.

Another couple guys moved in on the Lord room despite
being told it was being covered (and had been broken by
the first pair).  A while later the first guys 
went up during a lull to discuss the matter
with the newcomers, and I tagged along for lack of
anything better to do.  After a very short discussion
about whether the newcomers were or were not exhibiting
proper etiquette by moving in (personally I think they
each had some good points, but I kept silent and just
watched since I wasn't directly involved), the newcomer
decided he would prefer to give up and have something to whine
about rather than either stand his ground, or continue
the discussion to some sort of conclusion:

  a_whiner00 says, 'GL boys i think you've proven 
     to be this servers biggest collection of moronic 
     greedy assholes. Its no wonder none of you can 
     find a real guild'

"Real guild", of course, being defined as one big
enough for its members to feel like some sort of
elitist condescending snobs.  I didn't hurt his feelings 
by telling him that I have standing invitations to join 
four different mega-guilds that even he would be likely 
to consider "real guilds", but have chosen not to accept any.

The followup whine was:

    'try that kind of stuff in any real zone like Velks 
    or the grey, and you will find it very hard to be 
    liked on this server.'

Um...  Velk's or The Grey is a "real zone" but Lower
Guk isn't?  And since when did The Grey have camps?
It's full of random spawns.  It's especially interesting
that this member of a "real guild" didn't think to
mention any actually uber zones instead of mundane ones
like Velk's and the Grey when he was trying to think of
examples of "real zones".

And last time I checked, the almost universally
accepted player-enforced etiquette (even among
"real guilds") -- and as opposed to Verant's
PnP rules -- is that if a player or group of players
has a batch of spawns covered in a way that doesn't
leave any mobs standing around very long, it's theirs
until they decide to move on.  It is, in fact, "very
hard to be liked on a server" if you make a habit of
insisting on horning in on a spot that's already 
covered while invoking a "one room to a customer"
PnP argument.

Ironically enough, I had nothing to do in LGuk
precisely *because* I didn't want to make a jerk
of myself by invoking the PnP in order to get
the Savant spawn from the group that was covering
Savant/Cavalier/Sage/Exe spawns.  And yet it
was Mr. You're-Not-Gonna-Be-Popular-On-This-Server
who had done just that to take the already broken
Lord room, then gave a lecture to the folks who
had broken it when they wanted to talk about who
should have what rooms.
