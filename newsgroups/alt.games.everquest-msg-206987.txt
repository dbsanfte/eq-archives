Gee, and here I coulda sworn my L20 Ranger started getting bow
crits at 12 (same level Warriors start getting crits).  ;)
I believe it is the double damage for non-rooted non-moving
opponent that you have to wait until L51 for.

Supposedly, aside from the improved crit chance, DEX is to Archery
as STR is to melee (i.e. small increase in max dmg), but I have no
idea whether that is actually true or just another ancient rumor.
