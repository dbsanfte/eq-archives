All my groups have an enchanter (me!), and while I don't have a problem with
2 or 3 folks off-tanking mobs, it just doesn't seem as efficient to me as
either pacifying or mezzing adds.  Almost every group I have been in has
used pacify and I haven't lost a mission due to the "extra" time it takes to
do it that way.  I would argue that it can actually take less time,
depending on the gear of the off-tanks (not to mention their class).  It
could mean using a lot more mana for healing.  It certainly means that the
mobs are dying more slowly than if the entire group was concentrating on one
mob, thus more damage is being taken overall.

With all that said, I'll get back to my point -- it's easy enough to root a
mezzed mob that is about to be woken up, and I always do that, even outside
of LDoN.

And I'm really sorry you see having an enchanter in your group as nothing
but a hassle :-\
