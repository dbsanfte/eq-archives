Well, the 10000 point heal applied to those mobs, they should
certainly get nerfed down to 7500 with the rest of us clerics.

Funny, I didn't even think about this, but mobs are the only place
I've ever witnessed the 10,000 heal effect, where you have Vox
down to nearly dead, she Cheals... and isn't even up past half!

Waste of ten seconds you could have been slaughtering people,
milady!
