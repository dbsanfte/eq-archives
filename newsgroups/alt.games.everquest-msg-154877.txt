I can imagine the level 1 wizard casting Enticement of Flame all over the
place from his new robe.  Wouldn't need to look into his spell book for
quite a few levels . . at least not until the mobs had more HP than a single
cast of that spell would kill.  Then again, maybe those quest robes have a
minimum level to use.  I don't think they do, but maybe so.
