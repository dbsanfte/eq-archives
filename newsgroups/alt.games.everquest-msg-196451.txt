Happily I have a 65 cleric or 57 bard and lots of 65 friends, if I get
the shaman up to 50 or so I'm reasonably certain I can arrange a group
capable of dragging my body in, killing the mobs in question, and paladin
rezzing the shaman to loot.  Maybe before that level, but there's a
tendancy to not pay much attention to anyone so trivial as to not yet
have hit 50.
