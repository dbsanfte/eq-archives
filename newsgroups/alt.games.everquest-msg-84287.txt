The warder always attacks the mob that does the most damage to it. Its
aggro is controlled by how much damage it takes from which mob.

Remember, as you get higher, the warder is lower level compared to
you. If he runs by another mob that aggroes him and attacks before he
can get to your target, he will attack that mob.

If you want the warder to switch targets, cast drowsy on the mob you
DON'T want it to hit. It will switch back.

The level 30 pet heal still isn't more efficient than the level buff
cheal, though. It only restores about 1/3rd of the pet's life, and is
not as mana efficient as the level buff. Once you hit 39, the pet
level spell takes so long to cast that it's better to use the pet
heal. The level 39 pet heal restores about half of the pet's life and
takes 125m while the level buff restores all for 200m, so while it's
still not quite as efficient as the pet level buff, it only takes 4.5
seconds instead of 8. That's a big difference, and I've stopped using
the level buff as a heal entirely.

Half the problems with the pathing seem to be related to the warder's
size. They start out so small they can't get over rocks and steps and
such. I have the 39 warder, and he rarely gets stuck.
