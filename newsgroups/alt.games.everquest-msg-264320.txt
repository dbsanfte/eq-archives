Naturally, you have to temper it with reason and the healer always dictates 
the pull rate, but as a chanter, I often find that after all my given tasks 
are covered, I'm left with nothing to do other than mana-inefficient 
nuking. IMO, my mana is much better used mezzing. It keeps the DPS high and 
it's my job.
