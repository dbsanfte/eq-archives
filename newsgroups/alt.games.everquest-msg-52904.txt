If i have to collect bat wings for lvl 4 spells one more time, i htink my
head will explode.
VI should implement some reincarnation routine that could be used to select
race&class again. Like... I would pay ((lvl+50)^2)PP and would lose 5% of
total exp. That would allow me to visit class&race selection screen again.
The skills would be reseted to 0% but you would get the points (except once
from trade skills) into some pool and i would be allowed to dump them into
whichever skills i like. There would be no caps in training except for the
standard 5+lvl*5.

I think this would greatly reduce twinking as most people start new chars
just because they want to play another class. Every alt i have started was
just because i wanted to try something else but the low levels are just
sheer boring and annoying after first time. At approx 20 you can actually
start doing something else than whack-a-mole-exp-grind. At that time you can
enter some dungeons in groups. You are not so fragile anymore that a one
slight over pull will lead to a complete party wipe. Yeah sure i had fun in
Unrest learning the ropes with my first char but the second time it wasn't
any fun as the group just hindered my exp down.

There is a risk of becoming a reincaholic thou. :)
I'm idling my days at BatMUD (telnet://bat.org and say hello to Fizzl :))
and there is a reincarnation system. Seems like very good way of break
boredom. Thou at BatMUD rules permit more than one char so the reinc system
is essential there.

Soo... Has this been discussed many time before? Any ideas? what do you
think?
