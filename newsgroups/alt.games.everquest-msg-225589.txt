There are some in game messages which include the sex of your mount, and 
it turns out all drogmar are female, regardless of the gender of their 
riders.

I forget what the gender is on the messages for a horse, its been an 
awful long time since I've played the only character I have which has 
one... drogmar have much better visibility and targetting.

Splendid One, 52 Gnomage
Rider of Splendid Two, little white drogmarette
