I'm sort of embarrassed to admit this, but in all my years of playing *I'm a
VERY casual gamer* I have only ever bothered with one key...  That is the Old
Sebilis key.  *I am working on Vex Thal now, but eh...I'll get there
eventually... LOL*

Anyway, if they all work like OS works, then when you get your key, you just
have to have it on your toon the very first time you enter that new zone. 
After that, you can go so far as to destroy it.  There is no need to carry the
key on your toon after the first use because if you do /key you will see that
key now showing up on your list.  :)

Hope that helps...
