I agree, I remember when I first arrived in Freeport, I was in awe of all
the people gathered there, talking and trading.  I thought to myself,
"this is the hub of civilization in Norrath!  This is the place to be!".
It was a great feeling, one that, I unfortunately, is lost on a lot of new
players (as few as they may be).
