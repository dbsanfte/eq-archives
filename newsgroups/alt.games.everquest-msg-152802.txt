I'm NOT crowing or tooting anybody's horn...but if 10 seconds of criticals
gets a warrior's damage anywhere NEAR my rogue's damage output far
enough that by damage alone he tops me on the aggro list, I'm quitting.

Not from envy, just from my own obvious lack of skill.  Hell, for a 55+
rogue,
Evade isn't a fun way to wait for backstab to recharge, it's an essential
tool
for aggro control.  When your dps is 3/4/5/6x the MT's dps, you have to have
SOME way of dropping that aggro...but some other class' dps ain't going to
go near your own in pure numbers alone to do it.

Maybe getting that monk or cleric to sit down or something near the boss
mob...
;-)
