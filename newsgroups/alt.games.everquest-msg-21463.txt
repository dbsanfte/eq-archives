176 at level 29 is excellent (compared to the average non-twink of the same
level).

Sure.  I have about 17 - 20 characters (2 accounts, occasionally play on a
different server as well).  All but, I think, 2 are wood elves or gnomes.

Neither have great stats, but I love Kelethin and GFay and the fact that all
wood elves can forage and hide.  That seemed, oh, so ELFISH to me.
And gnomes are just plain the best race in the game...as long as you don't
look at the stats. :)
