The wizard should have let you all know that he had evac.  When I play with
my druid, the very first thing I tell people is that I have evac up, and all
someone has to do is say evac.  I hit the hot key, no questions asked and no
second guessing.  I learned that trick from another druid, and while I
tended to forget about saying Evac when on my bard, a quick rogue kept it in
mind and used it to our advantage several times.
