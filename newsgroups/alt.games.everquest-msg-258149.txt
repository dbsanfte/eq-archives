have you ever been in a group long enouth to TALK to people and educate them
?  - it's all verry well moning about people but if all you do is run away
when they make any kind of mistake then you are not doing anything to HELP
the situation .. i'd say pepole disbanding like that would get into my
'never again' list myself
