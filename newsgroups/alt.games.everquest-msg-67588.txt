Frankly, unless your bard has high INT or WIS (not likely), I wouldn't
bother doing tradeskills.  The reason is that the higher of INT or WIS
determines how fast you will skill up.  If both are relatively low, it will
take longer to get skill ups, and you'll end up spending a lot more time
and money on it.  Before I knew that, my bard went down that road...
took forever!

So your necro would be a good choice for a blacksmith or tailor.  Load
up your characters with as much WIS or INT gear (whichever has a higher
starting point) when you do your tradeskills.  I don't recall if necros are
INT or WIS casters.

As enchanters are INT casters, get your enchanter
to make two +INT rings  (or buy them from another jeweler before you
start).  +2 INT rings are only 3-5pp each.

Check out www.eqtraders.com for lots of good tradeskill information.
