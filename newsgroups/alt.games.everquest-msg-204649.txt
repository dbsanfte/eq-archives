An EB item is vastly superior to cast EB.  See, it never wears off.  Now I know
you are thinking you'll be good, you'll keep up with EB...  Tell me that while
you're asking me for a rez in Kedge.

I've seen more deaths from EB dropping in every camp where EB is required than
from any mob in the zone.

Plus even if you are perfect at maintaining EB, you'll still end up having to
keep EB memmed, which means its costing you 1/8th of your potential spell
casting flexibility.

Now its true, you might be better off selling it since you won't likely have
much use for it until you hit your 40s, but thats another issue entirely.
