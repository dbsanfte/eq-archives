Yep, and considering that I was planning on buying two more tinkerers 
bags, and was able to instead save over 3kpp, I got a deal.  Oh, and I 
truly despise killing greens, and spend the vast majority of my EQ either 
raiding or doing small exp groups to regain exp lost raiding.  I have 
almost no use for PP, since there are probably very, very few items that I 
would ever want now that are tradeable, and the few tradable pieces that I 
want are very, very rare and at very, very expensive.  (Mask of the 
Tinkerer being the only one that comes to mind.)  Other than food, drink, 
and another tinkerers bag, it's just gets donated to the guild fund 
anyway.
