Yeah if people are turning it off its likely they are for a reason.
For example, in this person's case it sounds like he logged into EQ
for the first time in several days and just wanted to chill in lower
guk where he was. Although he does not say so, he probably had
guildchat off because its likely people were screeching about needing
people on this raid or what not which is why he had it off in the
first place when a person started personally screeching at him.

I've really never had guild chat off unless the guild was doing a raid
and I was not there and they were using guildchat as a way to
coordinate the cleric complete heal chain, pulling etc. If you know
you are not going to be at a raid seeing this:

INC A GIANT FOOZLEDOOZLE SOMEONE GET IT OFF ME PLZ! LA~ 
COMPLETE HEALING ubertanker01, Docbob you are next!
COMPLETE HEALING ubertanker01, RexMorgan you are next step up to the
plate!
Complete healing target, FlorenceNightengale you are UP TO BAT!
UBERTANKER01 IS DOWN NEXT TANk, JUDAS JUMPING PRIEST ON A CROSS!

etc gets a bit distracting. There are a lot of valid reasons why you
might not be on the raid also, being raided out is one of them. For a
time it seemed like everytime I logged into EQ a 6 - 12 hour raid was
just starting. I stayed level 55 for like 18 months, that gets a bit
old eventually and I don't think I should have to adjust my life just
to be online when no raid is happening. The alternative is being
online and playing but maybe not making every raid.
