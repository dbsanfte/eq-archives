On 2/19/01, a fellow started a new thread about a guy who
had been a jerk in his group, then continued to harass him
later on, and was often hunting the same location (High Keep)
the author liked to hunt in and was thus hard to avoid, especially
since the guy kept spamming him with /duel challenges (back
before the game was patched to make /ignore also block /duel).
He concluded with the following perfectly reasonable question:

# Whats the solution to this problem? Should I petition a GM? He is smart
# enough not to cuss in his tells, just calls me a jerk mainly. I never
# respond so he starts doing it in say/ooc/shout mode. I finally put him on my
# ignore list so as long as I am not in the same zone all is fine but I like
# HighKeep. What to do?

You responded with:

That sure as hell looks like a flame to me, Bizbee.  You later
added that you thought it was "too bad" that he even existed:

# In any case, it's too bad your father
# wasn't around to take my advice several years ago.

I'm sorry, what was that you were saying about how you doubt
I'll be able to come up with even "<one>" cite?


>I'm going to have to insist on at least TEN cites

My first reaction to your childish and arrogant "insistence"
was to respond with something like, "no, Bizbee, I think
I'd rather watch you hold your breath, stamp your feet,
cry, turn blue, and call me an 'ignorant fuck' for about
the twentieth time in the year I've been in this newsgroup,
it's much more entertaining, and in fact only helps
reinforce my point".

I'm not here to do your bidding, child.  I stand by
my statement, and most people who have been in this newsgroup
for any length of time have seen you go off in the manner
I describe.  I hardly need to jump through hoops made
to your specification in order to have credibility on this
matter, I can let your own history here speak for itself.

But then I thought, oh what the hell, Bizbee has done it
often enough that making him eat his own words could be
highly satisfying, and well worth the work that would be
required to wade through thousands of old posts.

So I went off to Deja.com to start pulling up examples...

...and lo and behold, I discovered that not a single post
of yours can be retrieved from Deja.com, because from
day one, you have had your "X-No-Archive:" header field
set to "yes", which tells Deja.com (and other usenet
archives) to flush your posts instead of saving them
for posterity.  And this is definitely NOT the default
in your Forte Agent newsreader, so I know you set that
option on purpose.

In my long usenet experience, I have come across people
who have set "X-No-Archive: yes" for exactly three reasons:

1.  They knew they were posting a very long post that had
    no redeeming value beyond a few days after it was
    posted, or were reposting a long "periodic repost"
    (like a FAQ) that had not changed since the last time
    it had been posted, and they were responsibly making
    sure that they didn't waste archive space with a post
    that wasn't worth being archived (because it was
    redundant or of only short-time value).

2.  They were paranoid and didn't want "Them" to be
    able to come along later and examine their writings.

3.  They were such a troll, jerk, maniac, flamer, or
    nutbar that they had gotten tired of having their
    own words repeatedly come back to haunt them when
    someone dredged up one of their past idiocies and
    justifiably used it against them.

So Bizbee, what's YOUR excuse for wanting to ensure that absolutely
none of your posts could ever be retrieved and reread at a later
date, eh?

Also, just what kind of asshole would "insist" that I produce
ten of his past posts as proof of anything, when he knew
full well that none of his past posts *could* be produced
in their original form?

In order to fulfill your whining demand, Biz, I'd have to
be obsessive enough to save personal copies of all your
rants when they occur.  For all my flaws, I don't think I
appear obsessive enough to keep a personal archive of
Bizbee's Greatest Hits.  So since you knew I wouldn't have
my own copies on hand, and since you knew that you had
kept your posts from being archived on Deja.com, you
knew damned well that it would be quite difficult for me,
or anyone, to quote ten of your "flame the ignorant"
rants.  Not very sporting, Biz -- setting up a challenge
you knew could not be met even when true.

The only examples of your rants that still exist are
the ones that are preserved in amber, when they happen
to be quoted in other people's archived posts.  But since
most of your rants just get rightly ignored, only a fraction
of them survive in that manner, *and* it makes them more
difficult to unearth and reconstruct.

However, there are a few that can still be retrieved, such
as the one I quoted above.  Here's another time you
gave someone a hard time for asking an innocent question...
On 10/25/00, "jdean" started a thread and asked:

# Does anyone know where to get packets of Kiola Sap.  
# Apparently I need them to cure silk.  Any help would
# be geatly appreciated.
#
#                        Sorry  Lost the manual!!!!!
(See the original message at:
http://groups.google.com/groups?as_umsgid=39F75977.58074D63@email.com)

Rather than help, or if you didn't want to, simply ignore
it, you replied:

# In article <ifpevsg5s26aop1hsnd9mmr49njua8h88g@4ax.com>, 
# tuberoo@ix.netcom.com says...
#
# uhhhh.... ever hear of about 50 or 60 websites dedicated to the game,
# including the one by Verant? 
# This handholding, lead-me-through-the-game thing is getting kind of
# old.

Hardly one of your hottest flames, to be sure, but a clear
slap in the face nonetheless.  Several people felt compelled
to point out to you that asking questions about Everquest
was the one of the primary PURPOSES OF THE NEWSGROUP, so it
seemed a bit hostile of you to give someone crap for, gasp,
daring to ask a question about the game.

And, of course, you like to flame people who helpfully
ANSWER questions as well.

How about the time Taras Bulba answered a fellow who
wanted to know about the current state of Ultima Online,
and whether it was worth playing.  He constrained his
response only to talking about what UO was like, he
made no statement about EQ.
(Read his post at
http://groups.google.com/groups?as_umsgid=3a188254%241%40news.iprimus.com.au).

His only mention of EQ at all was:
# The graphics are different from EQ, but there is a 3D client
# due out early next year if you prefer that view of the world.

You then retorted with the flaming, and incoherently
off-base:

# "bizbee" <tuberoo@ix.netcom.com> wrote in message
# news:v00j1tk28av3b2ho0lh9fsp6ebmfa83ofi@4ax.com...
#
# By the way, moron, you forgot to add that your brilliant advice is
# concluded from a grand total of what... FOUR FUCKING DAYS of playing
# EQ... if that, since on the <16th> you said "I think I'll give it a
# shot..."
# Or did you think we were incapable of scrolling back on our
# newsreaders and seeing your other posts?
#
# Fuck off.

Since the guy was specifically talking about ULTIMA ONLINE,
this was so bizarre that even one non-combatant came back
to you with:

# Having a bad day, bizbee?  I don't see any mention in
# the quoted text that the person was offering any advice
# about the game itself.

Taras Bulba himself came back and explained to you, in
small words that even you could understand, that he was not
talking about EVERQUEST, he was talking about ULTIMA ONLINE.
You didn't take the hint, you continued your laughably
misguided flames:

# How in the FUCK can you "give advice based on two and a
# half years in UO" (as if anyone gives a shit) and absolutely NO
# experience of playing EQ? HEY, ASSHOLE, I'M TALKING TO YOU! Now,
# answer the fucking question, dickhead! If this is the way you run your
# entire life, you must be one sorry ass piece of mung.

And:

# LOL! I love uppity shitbrains. Here it is at last, you simple ass, you
# don't even play the fucking game, and you're telling someone what to
# spend their time and hard earned money on, BASED ON COMPLETE
# IGNORANCE! AAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAH! Man, people as ignorant and
# self-absorbed as you come along once in a lifetime--thank GOD!

Truly a milestone in "over the top flames that completely missed
their target and made the author look stupid or insane or
both", I must say.

Not being content to merely give abuse to people who ask
questions, and those who answer them, you also do so to people
who post useful information and offer suggestions as to how
some problems in the game can be fixed.  On 07/18/00, when
"Sidhe" posted a long, very detailed, very well-researched
post about problems with the Z-axis and Bard songs,
and even politely placed a warning in the subject line
about the length ("PLAYER INTERACTION BUG! (LONG & DETAILED)"),
you felt compelled to read it anyway, then chime in with a
bitch about its length while disparaging its content (which
was actually quite well done).  Your pointless, insulting
retort was:

# On Tue, 18 Jul 2000 11:03:40 -0700, bizbee

(Read Sidhe's original informative post at:
http://groups.google.com/groups?as_umsgid=39747B5B.68E168E6@home.net)

Heck, you even flame people who nicely answer questions
that YOU asked.  On 12/3/00, you asked:

# why is there always a big race to
# be the first person to post "The Patch Message" to this newsgroup,
# since anyone playing the game is going to have it thrown in their
# face...

Aaron Michael Newton responded:

# Personally I like to see them because
# I can check the newsgroup from work. 
# Others are probably in a similair situation
# where they can read the group,
# but not log in to EQ.  So they do it for me/us. :D

Your loving response was:

#
# ahhh... I understand.... so you don't have

Along with a torrent of responses asking you
whether you had ever heard of the concept of
a lunch break, your "I'm a Tourette's syndrome
poster child" attack also managed to prompt
yet one more person, out of a long list
over the years, to decide that you really *were* an
out-of-control flaming asshole after all:

# From: Aaron Michael Newton (amnewt01@louisville.edu)
#
# ...You know bizbee... I've tried.  Really
# I have.  I've tried giving you the

# and this last post of yours I will ever read. 
#
# Fuck off you presumptuous little twit
# and have a nice life.

Etc. etc.  It gets old pretty quick, Biz.

And it's laughable that you would get all high-and-mighty
over someone daring to speak the truth that you sometimes
flame even when it's not deserved.  It is further
ludicrous that you would screech in indignation over
my simple comment, when you've dished out enormously
worse to many people, including me, on a frequent basis.
There's an old, but appropriate saying about being
able to dish it out, but not take it...


>(this shouldn't be
>too difficult, since you just said that I OFTEN do this...
>ESPECIALLY.... right, Dan?),

Yes, Bizbee, you often do this, and you, especially of all the
people in this newsgroup, are known for it.  You've been called to
task on this behavior on many occasions, by many people.

Surely this is not news to you.


> just to show you what an ignorant fuck
>you've apparently just made of yourself.

I'll let that statement speak for itself.


> Then I would expect an
>apology for your defaming comment, but I know it won't be forthcoming.

You want an apology, Bizbee?  Here it is:  I'm *sorry* you're
too often a jerk that flames people for no damned good
reason.

Do you make a lot of good posts?  Sure.  Do you often flame
people who actually *deserve* to be flamed.  Yes you do.
But you also tend to whip out the flamethrower too readily,
sometimes for no discernable reason whatsoever, and wield it with
a gleeful gusto that seems to say more about you than it does about
many of your targets.

As I'd already acknowledged, you'd gotten better recently.  Try
not to revert by blowing a gasket over an allegation that
can hardly be new and shocking to you now.  Hell, Biz, you've
often seemed proud of being the number one flamethrower in this
group, don't start getting all bent out of shape just because I point
out that you sometimes target the undeserving.


>If you come up with them, then <I> will apologize... but I'm not
>writing my apology up just yet, pinhead.

I never expected an apology, Bizbee, nor asked for one.  First,
because it wouldn't matter a bit if you did.  But mainly,
because it's never very fruitful to expect someone to apologize
for what is obviously their fundamental nature.
 

>The only point either of you have here is clearly the ones on top of
>your heads.

Sigh -- Biz, this zing, like your recently used "off his medication"
line, is so trite and lame that I have to wonder why you even bother.
Why not just call me a stinky poo-poo head if you're going to
be so lazy in your flames?
