They warned about ONE patch smartarse, not three.

Its all very well for you living in the UK, you're 10 hours behind, so 
by the time you come home from work the patch would have finished and 
you're ready to play. This happens each and every time a patch comes 
along, we are unable to play for half a week. Why are we paying for a 
service we can't use due to Verant's incompetance?
