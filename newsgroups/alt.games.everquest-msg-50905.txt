Your post bring me back the day I camp the CASK.

I stay in the lowest level of BB and camp the brewer. Guard is the PH and
the gnoll brewer is rare spawn. Master Brewer is ultra rare spawn.

However, in all the time I camp there, few brewer spawned (and killed by me,
for sure, they die in no pain) and even master brewer spawn once, but none
of them drop the cask.

Finally, I get the cask as gift by other player when they give up the J
Cloak quest.
