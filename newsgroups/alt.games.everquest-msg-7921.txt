yeah, I know the feeling. I have a lvl 54 warrior (barb) and I must say Ive
come a long way. My equipment is now quite impressive a long cry from the
dayz when a Langseax was uber and bronze was exspensive. Oh yeah, the dayz
when Icegaints would womp my piddly lvl 17 ass in about 5 seconds. Or better
yet, and Iam sure all halas warriors can relate to me on this one, when
vengful lyricists would chase me to the Gaurds or kill me whatever came
first. Today I soloed a Giant in the Dreadlands just for shits and giggles,
and its always fun to go back and kill the DE guards that hassled me on my
way to Sol B. So I empathise with newbies. Thats why when I kill dwarfs in
Icewell I always bring back some of the nice velium weapons for people in
the newbie yards. Its great to see them say Thanks about 20 times. I just
hope I can look back at lvl 54 when Iam 60 and remember when I didnt have my
epics or any pieces of armor from Kael Drakal quests. I guess Ill have to
wait and see.
