Where are you flagged for? With a 65 ranger (meleeing , as a tank) and
a 60 druid with FT10 and self buffs I happily duo the plane of valor
and halls of honour. Really the druid doesnt require much attention,
just horse up, and incomplete heal. I have self 50% haste on the ranger,
but I think ornate melee gloves can give you the same thing and you'll
presumably get those nifty AA's for emergency tanking.

Do you have any slow sticks on your warrior? Outside of POP if the DPS
is too great you could try any animal heavy zones where your druid can
fear, dot and snare while the warrior beats on a mob (set up hotkeys
so you can fire off a standard set of spells with a simple alt+tab,
while maintaining concentration on the warrior).

Velks was mentioned and is ok for really easy to kill xp too, and I 
find Cazic Thule 4c ziggurat a lot of fun, but that I dont generally
do without a rezzer nearby as it can go wrong fast with adds. Bind
sight and harmony makes single pulling pretty easy though and the mobs
are nice high level with good chances at loot. Be careful of dual
wielding Thule lizards, especially the brown adept - he's dual wielding
a fleshgrinder which is a mean toy ;)

For fun I do city of mist reavers - thats more the entertainment
though, its not good XP or loot really, but taking down Rak Ashiir
is still a grin. Myconids in Sebilis with the chance of a fungi tunic
dont suck too much, but again its a be careful of adds thing - druid
evacs fine though, as long as you learn to evac *before* you have heal
ggro if things go wrong ;)

To be honest, I dont really XP much in luclin... at 65 at least Im
hard pressed to think of anywhere worthwhile nowadays. Im pretty sure
even POI must be easier XP than FG, and I can duo that with zero
downtime... HOH and POV tend to be duo with med breaks till I pick up
a beastlord/shaman/additional healer to pad out the group, then chain
pulls as we pick up others.

For XP, I find POV hard to beat really, given how easy it is to start
a group there (many rootable , snarable mobs make it very safe) and
pick up more folks to speed the kills. Its harder to just settle in
as a duo and ramp up in tactics, bot, etc, and duoing is out of the
question in the ele planes... kiting fire is possible, but so much
of a hassle by comparison it doesnt really seem worth it.

Let me know what you find as well ;) New places to mook about are
always appreciated, I like exploring ;) Hate LDON, so anything fun
in the old world or new pocket zones would be nice. Maybe I'll give
LOY a proper poke ;)
