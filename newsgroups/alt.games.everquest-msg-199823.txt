>Planetside lets you fight for one of three cliche ridden factions at war! 
>You can be the evil nazi tyrannical Terran Republic*yawn Starcraft ripoff*, 
>The Vanu Virginity*yawn futuristic scientists who violate morality*, or The 
>New Conglomerate*yawn freedom lovers 9/11 United We Stand Never Forget*

Terran Republic - Unite the planet under the old school empire
New Conglomerate - Create a new empire seperate from the TR
Vanu Soveriegnty - Build an empire based on alien technology found on
the planet.

Cliche, but nothing like the "reviewer" describes above. Each empire
has their own unique look and weapons.

>Planetside wouldn't be a classic Verant game if it didn't come chalked full

When beta ended the game was 95% balanced in my opinion. There are
still some balance issues between the 3 empires, but nothing that
ruins the game.

It's not that bad. Even on the worst beta days (lots of patches and
repatches) the servers were pretty stable when up.

>That's not all, you also get such great bugs as Snipers blowing up your 
>spaceship full of soldiers, or your weapons being not able to reload! 
>Yummy. 

The Sniper bug is a known issue, and I am pretty sure it was fixed
before beta ended. If not I know they are working on it. It is a
fluke, and doesn't happen every time a sniper fires on a vehicle.

The reload problem is a function of lag. If youre connection is
lagging the reload command will lag.

>And the Vehicle physics are magnificent, gaze in awe as your tank of doom 
>rolls over a rock and blows into a million pieces! Yay.

Everytime you hit a object you take a little damage. If your vehicle
is almost dead, hitting a rock might finish you off. Tanks are
monsters in PS, and can take a lot of punishment unless they run into
a squad with anti-vehicle weapons.

That's the price you pay for a persistent online world. I agree that
it gets boring and repetetive, but the scale of PS is too large to
have "map matches" like in a typical FPS.

> I demand you take my 14.99 a month!! BTW,

You are paying for dedicated servers, and the continued production of
the game. You are also paying to avoid hackers (the bane of
Counter-Strike, and other popular FPS). If you don't feel it is worth
it don't pay. 

>The graphics in this game are so horrible I feel obligated to distract you 
>with this sexy picture of Natalie Portman scratching her ******.

The graphics are pretty damn good. I don't know what this guy is
smoking.

>Oh no, God unleashes his Golden Shower attack, I pity those poor ******s 
>that will catch his hepatitis! 

This is supposed to be a review? I think the guy writing it read
through the whining on the beta board instead of actually playing.

>Wow, what a feature! The game randomly kicks me off so that I can check my

Unless they screwed up the gold version, PS was decently stable at the
time beta ended. People with cronic crashes generally had driver
issues (typical for any game).

You have to accumulate 1000 grief points before you get weapon locked.
Killing another player on your side might net you up to 20-30 points
per incident. Taking out a friendly dropship that has a full squad
might earn you 500 grief points. Only an idiot or a greifer will hit
the limit, and it teaches all players to think before shooting or
charging into a battle with total disregard for friendlies..

Total bull-doo-doo.  Grief points slowly subtract over time. The only
way a player will stay "locked" is if they make a habit of spamming AE
weapons into groups of enemies and friendlies or by intentionally
griefing.
