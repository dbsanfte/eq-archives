Go to the Sony message boards and go into the technical help section.
You will read a litany of posts from people who have upgraded to DirectX
8 and are now either experiencing massive fuzziness in graphics, or are
unable to get EQ to run at all. I was going to do it today, but until I
get more information specific to my systems, I'm now scared shitless and
I'm not upgrading until Verant does something that makes my current
system stop working and *forces* me to try it.
