Why? Even my little twinks had 255 wis or close to it, using only
cheap bazaar fodder and quest items... I mean ,I was a raider,
but I *never* gave my twinks raid gear... I had a cleric and
a druid both maxed out pretty easily.

I accept a genuine non twinked working their way up toon wouldnt
be able to do my 'bazaar hmmm, I'll buy that and that and that'
approach , but still. It didnt cost me that much... and as a 
Ranger first going up the ladder I remember buying a lupine
dagger for 11k and a silken whip of ensnaring for 14k (back
in the Kunark/Velious days) when there was less cash around
and it was harder to accumulate it...
