Bots...

I always play a bot.   99% of my eq time (exp and raids) involves running a
bot.

Number 1 is the monk.. always.  I am a monk.
Second one is a toss up between a 60 shaman and a 60 cleric.  It varies
based on the zone, group, and guild needs.

Yesterday (now 2 days ago) a cleric was needed for Rhags, so I left the
shaman behind and took the cleric..

On some raids I will bot all 3.. I've done it in exp camps a lot, I've done
it on raids a lot (e.g AoW size raids).  I played early last week, ended up
in a CT group that consisted of me - Monk, Cleric, Shaman.   And Person 2 -
Warrior, Rogue.

Sure its not as effective as certain people.. there are clerics and shamans
whom are much faster than me to react.. heck thats a given, when you
consider 2/3 chars or 1 char.

BUT.. I know a lot of clerics who I know I'm better than.. in terms of agro
management (on the cleric), in terms of deaths (or lack of, for my group),
and in terms of kill rate without having to stop for the cleric to med.
And thats whilst im botting multiple characters.....

Its not really fun.. I mean at times it can be a chore - I've pulled on
raids where my shaman was also the designated Malo'er (Vindi, Statue, Idol,
AoW)... in exp groups such as kael arena(where I ran all 3 chars) I would
generally get my friend to pull.  I could still do it, like if he needed a
tag or went afk.. but its nice to have a little break and not have to do
everything.

I've taken a bot through nToV, tho I don't like ae fights so much if its not
"controled" ala Doze..

I agree with you in part, but I also disagree.  Sure your reactions are
slower when botting.. but some people react faster anyway, so even with the
added delay/distraction, they still react faster.

Maybe its just something you can either do or can't.. or maybe you just get
used to it and it becomes like normal.. e.g

2 days ago I was in a 1 group ssra second floor camp.  Its a rough camp, has
mobs that flurry and hit for 400+ and HT, plus various other spells.  I was
the puller and the only cleric for 4 hours+, but was still talking to people
in serverwide.age (and guild chat, raid chat, and to a friend) for the whole
time (organising multiple raids - we were doing basement, 1st, second and
third floor)

Some people have said just running 1 character they can get distracted,
whilst talking in the channel.

Yesterday, AoW.  Now this is a pretty huge raid for us..  I had the monk,
and the shaman.  The shaman malod Idol/AoW on engage, but was also grouped
with a batch of clerics (to keep them healed whilst they modulated), as well
as slowing any adds.  On top of that, my monk was fighting aow (last time
andmost before pulling too), with mucho concentration on the monk - a 1
second lapse of concentration and my monk would be dead

Several other people in my guild play bots *all* the time.. 1 woman brings 3
chars always.. and other guy has his rogue and cleric.. some of these people
are the most skilled in their class that you will find on a raid.

i guess it started mainly as a necessity.. my guild is no different to
pretty much any other tho, that more clerics is always nice.. I'd rather bot
a cleric and ensure I live through a doe/kland fight, than risk my chances
in getting grouped with a real guild cleric

Being able to see my hitpoints as an exact number is a definate bonus, I
have no doubt that benefits me.. but I also know im not a bad cleric.  I
know how fast somebody is going down in melee.. whether its safe to start
casting a cheal at 600hp, or 2k..  cuz if 600hp was safe - I'd always do it.

In exp groups, I think about nothing at all, other than what will maximise
my pull/kill rate, and cut my downtime..  e.g in velks I can pull x amount
of spiders at a time.. but I don't get lom.  (not including kei).

Bots.. if you can handle it, I have no problem at all..  some people can't
even handle 1 character without distractions!
