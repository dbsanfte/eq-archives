I don't really know what would happen, as I haven't tried. But, I will
share this. Some people on Rallos Zek will charm things like Coldain
Wolves, and send them on people. When the wolves attack someone, the
rest of the coldain help out the wolf, no matter if the attacker has
higher faction than the intended victim or not. So there is at least
one case where your faction does not carry over to your pet.
