Hi all,

I'm just about to start a new char and I was wondering about practice
points...

Is it a good idea to save them up and use them for trade skilling
later on when the level is much harder to obtain by traditional means?

Is there a cap on the level at which you can use a practice point?

Thanks in advance,
moldy
