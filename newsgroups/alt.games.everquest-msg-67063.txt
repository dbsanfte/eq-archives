Yesterday, Nov 9, 2001, Both Best Buy and Circuit City are selling the
Shadows of Luclin box for $13.99.  What the fuck!!!

I PRE-ORDERED IT for $29.99 and after one week its half the price, what
a fucking ripoff job by Sony, EB, Amazon and other pre-order sites.

I could understand maybe $5 off, but not freeking 60% off with the game
being available one week!!!


Think its time for a class action lawsuit for price rigging.
