THANK YOU!!!!!

Something my freaking ex-guild needed to understand.

I don't know how much time I spent trying to get into a group
with them to be told that they have a shammy, they don't need
me...and 15 mintues later getting asked to come rez someone
because they had a bad pull! Then [before I slowly crawled my way
to high enough to have my 96% rez]whinging because I didnt have
my clicky stick...which by guild rules they wouldn't help me get
unless I spent DKP points to call a raid ...

Actually I do have some measure of the time -
250 jewelcraft + grandmasters eyepiece [not bad for a cleric...]
200 baking
200 brewing
200 pottery
200 fletching
188 smithing
133 tailoring
[on my main]
