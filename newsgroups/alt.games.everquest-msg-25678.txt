Never join a guild that is just out inviting people, you won't like it. Your
best bet is to look at what guilds you may want to join, try grouping with
some of its members a few times to see what they are like. If you like the
people in the guild you then go apply to the guild. You'll be happier in the
long run if you get to know them before you join.
