Toolboxes. I've found them in every major Good-Aligned city. At
worst, Steamfont has a constant supply. Strangely enough, the toolboxes
also cost only about 1gp while the backpacks with the exact same
number of slots and weight cost closer to 6gp. Early in my career I
sold all of my backpacks and bought toolboxes instead.

As for "easy", it comes down to where you are KOS. It'd be real easy
to give a newbie a plat, send him into a town where you know they sell
toolboxes (Freeport, Erudin, and Steamfont come to mind) and tell
him to buy as many as he can carry, deliver them to you, and "keep
the change". The Deluxe Toolkits from Velious sound pretty interesting
also, but that depends on you having the Velious expansion and the
time to travel there and back. If the Giant-size carrying capacity is
all
you care about then a regular tookit will do the job just fine.
