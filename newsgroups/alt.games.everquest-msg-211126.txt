IIRC, the level 29 water pet is the only magician pet that requires chain
researching.  For all other pets that require research (up through 49), you
can always buy the previous spell circle's scroll from a vendor.  You can
also buy some spells in Katta that you can't buy elsewhere, namely the 39
Water pet (meaning only the 39 Earth is truly research only) and the 44 Air,
Earth, and Water (which means that all of your level 44 pets are
purchaseable).  Research really wasn't a pain for me until 49.  I had to
pour a lot of plat into my research skill which I probably wouldn't have had
without help from a friend.  Being untwinked, if you can't find a higher
level mage to combine them or get a good price on them in the bazaar, you
might be spending a lot of time either earning the plat to raise your
research skill or doing the concordance quests.
