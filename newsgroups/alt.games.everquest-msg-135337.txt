I think on some things this has already been happening. For example, on my
server, spider silks used to sell for 5pp a stack, and silk swatches sold
for 10pp a stack. Now I see spider silks bought for 20pp a stack, and silk
swatches for 40pp. Folks have been snatching up cheap ones and selling for
more, and the price has gone up on those. I thought the 20pp for a stack of
spider silks was a fluke at first, but it is now the "going rate".
