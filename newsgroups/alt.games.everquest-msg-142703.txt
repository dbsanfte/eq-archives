    Likelihood of working is pretty high - I'd say your 50% estimate is
about right. This isn't Death Pact, the back-of-the-book spell. We use DI on
some encounters where the margin for error is very small, and it is worth
it. It is so useful, in fact, that on one such encounter officers began to
panic a bit when none of the clerics were assigned to casting it. ;-)

    What changes the chances of success? No idea. The big rumour is that
CHA, either of the caster or of the recipient, does something. My personal
take: seeing a trend with CHA is like seeing a trend with rare spawns
depending on where you sit. You've just been playing for so long that you
see things that aren't there. I suspect it's simply a flat percentage chance
of going off.
