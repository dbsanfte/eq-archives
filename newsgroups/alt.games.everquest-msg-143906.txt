Anyway, where's the fun in that?  You stand around and collect xp... weee.
Kinda like IRC, except that the level 60 will be too busy farming to talk much.
Where is the "game" aspect to this?

Playing the game and figuring out "new" tactics is where the fun is, imho.  Especially
for players that have not yet  got to 50+ with any character.  If you work on tactics
and improving technique, the xp goes a lot faster because you're not thinking about
it.  You're thinking.. "where's the next mob...how can I make a cleaner, faster pull,
how can I build up sufficient aggro, how can I do max damage while taking
few hits, how can I best keep this thing feared, how can I get the most haste,
what's the best twist for regenning mana.... etc."

Once you stop thinking, it becomes a grind.
