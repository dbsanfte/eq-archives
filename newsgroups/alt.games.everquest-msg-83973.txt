Oh, suuuuuuuure. Focus on the negative side. What happened to your motto
of "What's a little death among friends"?  Hey, we were in there for
four hours at least and we only died once. And it was a GLORIOUS death
indeed! My heart was racing a mile a minute for quite a while after it
was over.
:-)

In fact, I'm alreay cooking up an insane plan where you, me, Orlun, and
Tylana could go hole the entry by ourselves if we can somehow lay our
hands on a copy of Succor for Ty.

Anybody know where that spell drops fairly often?
