Loral's Evil Agenda - Las Vegas, Summer 2005

by Loral on June 01, 2005

Next week I travel west to the Las Vegas Fan Faire and to the second
Everquest Summit. Once again I will bring my recommendations to help
improve Everquest. Many of the items discussed in previous Evil Agendas
have been addressed by SOE and it is my hope that these issues will be
addressed as well.
Help Players Find Groups

This is by far the number one issue in Everquest today. SOE developers
should do anything they can to help players find groups, build groups,
and get groups off and hunting as fast as possible. Players below 60
have much greater trouble finding groups than those above 60. SOE
should always look for ways to increase the pool of players looking for
groups at all levels. Here are some specific suggestions to help
improve grouping:

- Allow group invites across zones and from within the "Looking for
Group" tool.
- Continue to focus on mission-based content. Missions are the best
thing to happen to Everquest.
- Add missions for groups of three or four players instead of six.
- Add an in-game group scheduling tool to help players find groups
during certain play times.
- Add better rewards to single-group encounters so raiders and
non-raiders group together more often.
- Do not rely on soloing to solve the grouping problem.

SOE may also consider more radical approaches for players to group such
as allowing searching for players in other zones, allowing players to
automatically join a group, and allowing for cross-server groups for
instanced zones.

Beyond any other issue, SOE should continue focus on helping players
find groups, build groups, and have fun.
Add More Interesting Monsters

Dragons of Norrath gave us some of the best game mechanics in a massive
online game but the beasts left much to be desired. In Dragons we met
level 72 goblin kings unarmed and wearing loincloths, level 68 pumas
that hit harder than Cazic Thule, and spiders - lots and lots of
spiders.

I have watched gods die. I have killed vampire lords with my bare
hands. I fought in the Ringwar of Thurgadin. I have traveled to outer
worlds and to the deepest pits of hell. I shouldn't have to run from a
puma. I am a level 70 high priest; make me feel like it. Add beasts
worthy of my power and skill. Examples include cyclopses, death
knights, demons, devils, dire beasts, ettercaps, ettins, greater
elementals, giants, golems, gorgons, hell hounds, hydras, liches,
lycanthropes, medusa, manticores, mephits, minotaurs, mummy lords,
nagas, ogre mages, rocs, spectres, titans, vampire lords, wights,
wraths, and wyverns.

No more rats, bats, spiders, pumas, or loincloth goblins for level 70s.

Fun monsters are only one part of this topic, however. The other part
comes from varying the challenge of these encounters beyond hitpoints
and melee damage output. Fighting a lich and fighting a giant shouldn't
be similar encounters. Single-group monster challenges should have the
same wide variety that raid encounters have.
Add a Mentor System

As Everquest gets older the average level of players gets higher. As
this average level increases, including methods so higher level and
lower level players can hunt together, meet challenges, and receive
rewards, becomes more important. Add a method so lower level and higher
level players can group together, face challenges, and receive rewards.
This will lead to a much larger possible player-base at any given level
and allow friends who have different amounts of play time to continue
to hunt together. While level-based systems such as the Mentor system
of Everquest 2 work well, it is not the only way to accomplish this.
Rebuild the Plane of Knowledge

More and more players, both old and new, use the Plane of Knowledge as
their central gathering place. Rebuild the Plane of Knowledge with new
graphics, a new layout, new quests, and a new storyline. Make the Plane
of Knowledge the City of Adventure with a new government and new ties
to existing content. Build the city to prevent the video lag we receive
in the current city. While this is no doubt a monumental job, the heavy
activity in Knowledge, now and in the future, warrants the update.

Massive online game competition is fierce this year. Games begin to
demand more and more of our time. Everquest remains competitive with
all of the newer games and expansions like Dragons of Norrath offer
features unseen in existing MMOGs. If EQ developers continue to improve
grouping options, add new useful features, improve monsters, and update
the core city, Everquest can continue to thrive for years to come.
