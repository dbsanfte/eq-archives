That reminds me of every liberal who cries out "WHAT ABOUT THE
CHILDREN!!!!!"  AI goes far beyond Human Rights.  Look beyond what they
claim to be their aim, and look at what they really support, you may find a
degree of dissonance.

Incessantly?

Incessantly?  Trust me, CNN has pointed out the difference.  Of course, they
haven't said why that difference is significant.  Maybe you can tell me why
it's bad that Isreal is better at killing their enemies than Palestine?

Bullshit.  Jenine (SP?) was covered in full detail, even if much of that
detail was found to be blatent lies later on.

I did.  Maybe I'm just a bit more jaded than you.  Things like "degrading
conditions" were not expanded apon, making me wonder if they aren't just hot
air.  All in all, it sounds like something the NYPD could have done, except
for suspending the writ of Habeus Corpus, but I will remind you that Lincoln
did that during the Civil War.

What oppression?

Short memory?  Isreal's tried that several times, remember?  Each time, the
terrorism continued.  Even Clinton, a huge Palestinian supporter, blamed
Arafat for killing the middle east deal, since he wouldn't get his gang to
stop killing.  We have empirical evidence that Isreal stopping the
counter-attacks only spurrs more terrorism.  Now, is Palestine willing to
give peace a chance?  They haven't proven willing yet.

Yes, yes he is.  Why must Bush remain neutral?  Isreal is an ally to the
U.S.  Palestine is a group hostile to our ally.  Now, saying that, Bush
isn't blind.  He would not be pro-Isreal if they were in the wrong.  His
leaning towards Isreal is based on many things, including the fact that they
are the victims in this battle.  Many say he's been too harsh on Isreal, in
fact.  He keeps trying to tell Isreal to turn the other cheek, and when they
do, they just get more killed.

Oh, and there are no "disputed lands."  The area occupied by the
palestinians is part of the nation of Isreal.  If the Isrealies allow
Palestinians to exist there, that's their choice, though I can't help
questioning the wisdom of it.

Arafat is a known terrorist.  U.S. policy on terrorism states that we won't
give them the time of day.  Prime Minister Sharon (what is the proper title
for that?  Mr. Sharon?  Pres. Sharon???  Anyone know?) is the Head of State
for an allied nation, one that is under attack.  Pres. Bush's actions seem
to be in line with this nation's highest ideals.
