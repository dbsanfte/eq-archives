I don't.  I certainly HOPE that they are, since that would mean that the
game is still interesting to them.

Well, as I see it, if they're logged in as GM's, they're on duty.  They've
got personal accounts to play with.

If only GM at play events was as enjoyable to the players as it is to the
GM. : (  Almost every GM event I've been in involved quick and certain death
to lowbies.  If the events made things more enjoyable for the adventurers,
great, but I don't see how whacking a bunch of low level characters with
insta-kill monsters is any fun.

I have to agree with you there.  They are rare.  In a way, I'm thankful that
they are.  : P
