I sort of don't know how to do tells, just made a char on Protector server
this morning around 3 am and am very tired but I love this game so far, made
a Mutant Scrapper, Spine, Regen sets.  Will make a Blaster after work
tonight now sure of a name yet, my current chars name is Shadow Lynx.  Only
level 2 though lol.  I have a lot to learn yet.
