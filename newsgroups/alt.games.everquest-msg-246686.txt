Um, ps1.2 is not unused by anyone else. Half the effects in Far Cry, for
instance, are done with 1.2.  Both ATI and Nvidia can do 1.2.

They'd have to buy a solution that was backwards compatable with their
old engine so this is not necessarily a cheap solution. Otherwise they'd
need to convert all the zone files to support this off the shelf engine.
Besides, as they've already shipped the dx9 engine out to us, and
there's been no mention of it being a third party solution, I doubt they
have plans to change to yet another engine.
