I'd be very surprised to see proof of this, the "fact" that LOIO has a bonus is
practically dogma.

Of course I have no proof that there -is- a bonus, other than the
fact that I sure seem to get more exp for an even con kill there than
in SK (Happen to have just moved from SK to LOIO while during
level 20... and I've "raised" many other characters there)

Still, can you point to any evidence contradicting the general
wisdom that this is a bonus zone?

Further, if it isn't, why not?  Its a newbie zone for Iksar, I had the
impression that all newbie zones had a built in bonus.
