I have an Asus v9980 nVIDIA FX5950 Ultra with 256MB and had moderate lag
only in the Bazaar and no targeting problems prior to the patch, I now
have lag in every zone I've been to and targeting anything is
frustrating as hell. Graphics are terrible as compared to a few days
ago. Butcherblock, fo example, "shimmers" all the time and I keep
getting these triangles of white space in random spots. I know there has
been at least one patch to replace the somethingdx9.dll, as I downloaded
it twice while trying to log on yesterday, so I guess they're working at
fixing it. Wish they had held off a few more weeks and tested it more.
Hmmmm when do the 512MB vid cards come out?
