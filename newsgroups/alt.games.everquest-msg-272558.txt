I never claiming getting the tank to pull was the most efficient just
the safest, especially when things don't work out as planned. In my
experience the safest option is often the best one to choose. All the
methods mentions are still more likely to go wrong then having the tank
standing a few feet in front of the group and taunting the mobs. (He
too shouldn't be going that far away from the group to pull and
certainly not around mobs to get the one you really want. Clear out all
the possible add first is the best way.)
