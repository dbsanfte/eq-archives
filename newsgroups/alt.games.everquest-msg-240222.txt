The problem is that you are applying common sense to the law and
assuming it produces anything resembling what the law actually says.
People study for years to specialize in IP law and still argue over
the particulars of issues like this.

Selling plat is clearly a violation of the EULA. But, it may fall
under fair use if ever challenged in court. To call it a criminal
copyright violation would be a "unique and troublesome" interpretation
of the law.

Unless there is a precedent, it would take a truly keen legal mind to
give a reasonable analysis of how the courts would rule on this
matter, were it ever brought before them. With no legal background,
the best you or I could do is provide rank speculation worth less than
the paper that would be necessary to print it.
