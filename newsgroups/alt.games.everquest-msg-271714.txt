Hi,
I just finished Light Armor AQ2 and boy what a pain.  I needed to kill 20 
plaguebringers.  They pop when you kill the groups of Caltorsis knights 
around one of the foci by the Caltorsis ruins.  Getting them to pop was no 
problem, usually 4 to 6 of them would spawn.  The problem was that after my 
group killed them, I would only get credit for 1 kill instead of the 4 to 6 
that we actually killed.  It didn't happen everytime, but it happened enough 
that my group was getting pissed (since they were all grey to us).  Once, 
halfway through, we got a message saying 'you will no longer receive xp for 
this encounter' and I got none.  What the heck is up with that?  It took us 
about 10 pops to get my 20 plaguebringers, instead of 4.  Kudos to my group 
for sticking with me, and my new bracers are oh so sweet, but what a mess.

Loon Boon
