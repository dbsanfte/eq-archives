At your end, Taras. Headers come from you. Your continuing total
ignorance of how usenet works is noted.

I kicked your ass (again) and of course this is the best you could
come up with. You're a sad, sad little man, Taras. Same as before. :-)

Your time zone, you dumb fuck.

So you are now trying to tell us you post from the future? That,
despite the time of my post making it obvious it was impossible, you
DID post that at 9:39 PST of the 2nd?

Do you know how DUMB you sound?

Do you see anyone leaping to your defense?

That's you, Taras. The evidence is plain for everyone to see.

I can't make my clock go wrong like yours. However, I posted a link of
someone who can. That, of course, proves my case utterly and makes
your thrashing here even more pathetic.

I continue to be right. You continue to be wrong. Why would I
apologize?

Wow great one Taras. LOL

Only to someone as truly stupid as yourself, Taras. The evidence is
plain for everyone to see.

Do I need to post your header again? Would you understand it if I did?
Are you capable of that leap of intelligence, you stupid piece of
shit?

Of course not. All you can do is pretend nothing was posted at all and
fling insults around.

*Everyone* here knows you fucked up, Taras. You might get @ndrew to
support you, he's still pissed off at losing (just like you), but no
one else will.

No.

And its pretty funny watching you compound your foolishness by
pretending not to understand.

No, I think I'll keep kicking YOU around.

I planted it so far up your ass you're picking toelint out of your
nostrils.

Keep trying to explain this away, Taras!

Yep. Monday, April 5th, 12:33 pm (just after noon), Pacific Time
(adjusted for daylight savings). Sixteen hours from now.

God you're an idiot. LOL

Care to try again? If so, please make an ATTEMPT to explain how
exactly its my screwup thats causing YOUR header to be wrong....
