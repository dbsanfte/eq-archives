    Does raise overall mana regen rate above that of base meditation rate.
If I was unclear, that was what I was aiming for. Yaulp, for example, does
not do this because you can't use Yaulp and be medding at the same time. So
although it may mitigate mana loss when standing, it does nothing for pure
recovery. Same thing with Modulating Rod - it may give you a boost of mana
when you use it, but if you look at mana use over time it's a loss of mana.
