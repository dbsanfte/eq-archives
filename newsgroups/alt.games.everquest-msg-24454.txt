I know it's a pain but just ask your porter to make sure you
have sow and invis before you go.  I just got a port out of
Toxx with my Dark elf shadowknight.  I wanted to get back to
neriak,  I just donated first and asked for a sow and invis,
and was promptly in WC where i took off at a run before
invis (superior camo) could drop.  I had been trying for
over a week to get out of toxx, and when i finally got an
offer to get out I took it.
