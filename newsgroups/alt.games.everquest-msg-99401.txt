Hi there,

Encountered a (possible) broken quest last night.

Basically, did the hand-in (after following the single NPC script). 
Triple checked the items.

There were three items, and after each one, got a "Oooh, I need more".
 Even after the third (and final) one.  So, basically, I lost the
items and didn't get anything in return.  (Note: All three items were
handed in simultaneously).

This has now been petitioned and escalated.

Anyone experienced this sort of thing before?  Any luck with getting
the item they had worked hard for?

FYI, this is the Twilight Sea "Mask of Detonation" quest for the
Wizard.

Tris.
