Haha! I'm even leeter than Dream King! I use SLRN, and it's in
PERPETUAL beta! And I've used it for years too! In fact, I don't
think it'll ever leave beta (Up to version 0.9.6.3 now, I think,
and it was in 0.9 or maybe 0.8 when I started using it..)

Bow down to my newsreader l33tness!

But seriously, it's a pretty good newsreader, and it's a CLI
reader too, none of that namby-pamby GUI stuff for me, thanks!

Eep, just checked their homepage, they're up to 0.9.7.1!!! Time
for a download!
