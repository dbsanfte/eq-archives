    Imbued is not only above my skill level, but it's fairly poor armour for
the cost the smith has to charge. But I think you missed my point: since you
can't make a dwarf warrior that worships Rallos Zek, you can't get Heraldic
armour for a dwarf warrior. So people aren't making dwarf warriors as twinks
because they can't get the easiest "uber-armour" ever invented, and they're
scrapping existing low level dwarf warriors.

    I didn't. I got my smithing up BEFORE the nerf, when getting smithing to
175 meant sitting in East Freeport for a few hours. It went up to 180 by
doing motley Fine Steel Plate combines for others, not as part of some
concerted effort to raise the skill.

    I didn't, and I couldn't until recently (and even then with the prices
charged in The Bazaar I doubt I could buy for long). People brought stuff to
me to combine, or every so often if I saw some spiderling silks on newbie
area vendors I'd turn them into paddings.

    He does. But that doesn't change the fact that demand is still low, so
he won't be recovering any tips given to folks based on sales volume.
