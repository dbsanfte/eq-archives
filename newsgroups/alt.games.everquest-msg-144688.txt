  Join as a player, but your ideas help to develop this new game.

   You start out unable to walk.  You have to grow trees, then chop
down to get wood, then you have to whittle a walking stick in order to
move.   Whittle different items, build roads, fences, plant radish
crops, etc

   One of the only games where you have to go poo.  Build your own
outhouses.  Then when the outhouse explodes from too much poo, you
shovel it up and use it as fertilizer to grow radishes.  Different
radishes grow in each crop.   Radishes increase your health, and
different radishes increase your various skills
