It was early when I typed that. Blame the lack of coffee and not having
my EQ resources in front of me and going from faulty memory alone. But
no. It was a bug verified by a GM for me. (For which I got some crap, by
the way.) It was, now that you mention it, the Grand Historian, but he
wouldn't answer if you had him targetted. And when he did answer, I
definitely had myself targeted. The guy in the mines who starts the
Phenocryst Focus quest was bugged in exactly the same way. Used the same
solution to get him to respond. Got fixed a couple patches ago.
