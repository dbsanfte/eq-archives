I like to use "/shout Train to zone, %T and friends!"  If the people in the
zone have a clue, they know where the various mobs are in relation to the
zonelines.  "Train to zone, A Teir'Dal Dragoon and friends!"  is only going
to happen near the Skyfire zoneline in OT, for example.

And if you don't know which zoneline is being trained - assume it's yours!
