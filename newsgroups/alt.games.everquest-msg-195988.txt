Without knowing your class its hard to point to anything in particular.
Depending on class, knowing something about your basic gear might help too;
for a necromancer, your mana pool size and any FT and HP regen items, for a
warrior your HP total, weapons, and haste item, so on and so forth.

Generally NPC refers to a single named "mob" which is a generally odd thing
to solo on, although it does happen, there are some NPCs that spawn on a
short pop time and are for some reason particularly suited to soloing for
exp for some classes, a certain gypsy in Rathe Mountains and the necromancer
in Feerrot at the entrance to Fear come to mind as classics.
