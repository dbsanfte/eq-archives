That reminds me of a story...   The squeamish are
strongly encouraged to skip to the next message *now*.

One of my, let's say, less fortunate friends called
me a few weeks ago to tell me her computer wouldn't work,
and asked me if I could help her fix it.

Diagnosing problems over the phone is always tricky,
but after a bit of back-and-forth I surmised that her
power supply was kaput for some reason.  She asked me
what it would take to fix it, and I told her to bring
it by my house, I'd double-check that it was the power
supply that was the culprit, and if so I could extract
it from the computer for her, then she could run to
any computer store and get a replacement for a reasonable
sum, and I could re-install it for her when she brought
back the new one.

So she came on by with the computer, I opened a
folding table to use as a workbench, and placed the
computer on it.  Before I could even pick up my
screwdriver, a roach ran out of the computer and
across the table.  It was easily dispatched with the
"heavy blunt object" method.  For any entomologists
in the audience, it was a german cockroach,
_Blattella germanica_.  This species of roach is
rather small, thank god (about 1/2 to 5/8 inch long),
but it makes up for it with one of the fastest
and most prolific reproductive cycles of all the
cockroach family.  And they'll eat and thrive on
almost anything.  They spread like crabgrass.

As I unscrewed the first of the case screws, two
more roaches ran out.

Squish.  Squash.  I *grabbed* the computer, and *ran*
it out the front door to the porch.  I then grabbed
the Bengal roach spray (the most effective over-the-
counter bug spray I've ever found -- expensive but
worth it) and hosed down the table I had been using,
along with the floor around it for a distance of about
five feet in case any tiny eggs had rolled away on the
breeze.  The Houston heat and humidity is a great
environment for bugs, and I was *not* going to let
the little bastards get a foot-hold in my house.

Back on the porch, spray can in hand, I opened up
the computer, took off the case cover, and found...
let's just say a *lot* of roaches and leave it at
that.  Every time I sprayed another blast of
insecticide into the innards of the computer
and waited for the wave of deserters to subside
and thought they were all gone, I'd give it another
spray and get another surge.

I guess they liked the warmth, darkness, and
seclusion of the computer's innards.

When it was finally safe to perform surgery, I pulled
the power supply and looked into its vents
from both directions.  My diagnosis was death
due to a short-circuit caused by being packed
with roaches and "roach debris".

She took the computer away and thoroughly cleaned
it, bought a replacement power supply,
and sure enough the computer was fixed.

The final irony is that the person with the
dead computer and the amazing roach infestation
is my maid...  She does a great job on my house,
but I guess by the end of the day the last
thing she feels like doing is cleaning her
own place.
