I've got one of my entire life since level 44 or something.  It's a
big logfile.  Good thing Pasketti used extra-strong clockworks on his
parser.  I used an inferior parser initially; they're still talking
about the explosion.

Bards are either the least or 2nd least played class in any of the
surveys on the spoilersites, so I assume we are relatively rare.
Also, not a lot of reason for bards to be anon, so you probably didn't
miss that many.  As a bard, bards are the most seen class in my
logfile, but that's from checking out the competition I think.

I regularly see posts here from people who rarely if ever group with
bards, yet there seem to always be other bards in the dungeons I
frequent, and I'm almost never the only bard on raids.  If you rarely
group with bards, where do you hunt, and do you alwasy hunt with the
same folks?  I'm trying to think of new places to play for exp, and
figure sometimes I do want to be the only bard in the zone.
