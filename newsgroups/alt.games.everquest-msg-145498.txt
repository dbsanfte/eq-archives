Eastern Wastes would be full of blue mobs, and plenty of 'em to
go around. City of Mist is great fun and easily duo-able at that
level. My absolute favorite spot at those levels (as half of a 
SHM/WAR duo) was on the moon though...the southwest corner of 
Scarlet Desert. Great exp and the named bloodtribes can drop 
some mighty fine SHM gear.
