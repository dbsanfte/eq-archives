Wow - insightful. Care to explain why you believe this? Overhype?
Personal vendetta vs SOE? Dont care for star wars? Just saying "its
going to suck" (im paraphrasing of course) doesnt mean much.

I personally belive its got great potential, the question is can they
live up to that potential?

One thing that kind of irks me about the whole project, is that they
are already working on an expansion when the damn thing isnt even out
yet. Its already an "over ambitious" project, lets get it working
before we even consider making it bigger.
