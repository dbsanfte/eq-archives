Ok, does anyone else have the issue of having to use your scroll wheel
excessively to just get a distance of any use?

I have to scroll down like 5 plus  times (full wheel rotation) to get
to any distance that is worth while.

I am planning on checking my mouse software to see if upping the
scroll distance there has any help.


Just curious on others view points.
