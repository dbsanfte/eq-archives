My husband and I have done many many Ldons... he is the one who sets them 
up, and thus is the leader. He ALWAYS is very clear on who has what job 
before the Ldon begins. He is very good about it...  My CH takes 10 secs to 
go off... so when I hit my hot button that says "Incoming CH to..." Many 
seconds had been ticking away and JUST BEFORE it goes off... a little fast 
heal would come in from Mr. Druid. He was definitely casting his heal afetr 
mine... and after my message was posted.  He was either not paying attention 
to the group box or somehow felt that by seeing my message was his que to 
start healing. :(

Certainly I do not think the game revolves around clerics... but since I am 
a cleric and asking a question regarding my class that is what I am 
discussing. Do you think I should talk about some other class? That makes no 
sense to me.

You guys like to be mean to noobs here, evidently... guess the PC breeds 
brave folks. Bet you would not be so rude to someone talking to you 
face-to-face... but then again, I could be wrong about that...
