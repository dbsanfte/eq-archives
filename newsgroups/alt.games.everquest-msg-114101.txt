Hmm, I just did an experiment, and had 2 chars sit in the same zone. The
computer that always goes LD went LD, the other didnt. Then, as I was
logging off the non-LD computer, it went LD. Maybe it isnt me... Weird that
some router is being so selective about what packets it sends through,
especially because I'm sharing my connection with a router, so its all
coming from the same IP... Odd.
