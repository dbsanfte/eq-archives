Granted, I was thinking of situations where the crafter was making the best 
items they were able to make. Of course a level 60 crafter should be able 
to make you banded armor (if you really really wanted it, that is).

So far it seems I have 2 options:

1) "The Formula" (Crafted_Item_Trivial <= Buyer_Level * 5)
     a. Might not scale well.
     b. Check EQTraders. I didn't see too many issues at first glance.

2) No buying from a crafter of higher level than you, unless you provide 
the components.

One thing is for certain, crafting does complicate matters. :/
