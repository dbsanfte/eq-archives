The origin of the latest fuckup is because someone complained that a bunch
of 60s were soloing and perma camping stuff like Ice Giants to rack up the
fast AAXP... so they tried to fix it by nerfing ANY experience from mobs
"seriously below your level" for character that are 51+ (the AAXP hunting
crowd) and trying to make people take on mobs "you can reasonably manage"...
without any thought that the same Mobs a Necro or Mage would find they can
"reasonably manage" would kick seven shades of shite out of any other class
of the same level... which left them stuck fighting the same old crap, but
now with NO XP reward at all.

It would appear sanity has been restored... or at least temporarily borrowed
from someplace outside Verant
