There was one on Test just the other day.  Oh, sure, *technically* it 
was to test something, but it apparently involved attacking the PoD, 
then going on to attack the biggest prince kliknik you ever did see.  
And it kept getting bigger.  OY.  Raid didn't work worth shit during 
that whole thing, I'm hoping they noticed that.  And eventually someone 
cast that turn-the-mob-into-a-skeleton spell (and remembering the 
discussion I had with some people here about that, YES, it is VERY, VERY 
ANNOYING) many times over, and soon after that, it got pushed into a 
wall in the castle, and whether that's a bug nobody's ever had a chance 
to find out (like the one in HHK), or whether enough testing had been 
done, I dunno.  But it was rather fun to run around madly shoving your 
way through bodies everywhere to try and get a hit. :)
