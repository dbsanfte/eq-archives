They wrote the game vs rules. That's part of the point I am trying to make:
In all likelyhood they are running a Matrix Management type system at VI.
That means as programmers they get some input into how the game is run and
designed, but there is a different group that handles the Game Admin,
probably under the Customer Support division.
