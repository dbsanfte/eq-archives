*YOU'RE* the only one who said I don't have a clue. I don't have to be a
lawyer to be qualified to cast my vote for a new legislator. I don't
have to be a butcher to pick out a decent steak. I don't have to be a
freakin' fireman to know how to put out a wastebasket fire. Try again.
That was weak.

Now who's got an elitist attitude? No, it's *not* readily apparent that
I do not, but saying so supports your argument. I get that. It's a cheap
ploy, but I get it.

Like I haven't heard it discussed and whined about enough to have some
idea of what it takes.

This is part of the problem. More people should be able to go through
them in a shorter time.

Yep. Pretty much along the lines of what I've read a few times. So, is
that it? If it is, then you could say I'm now every bit as qualified as
you to comment on it. Yet, my opinion doesn't change. Doesn't matter.
I'm not grossly misinformed in any case, so yes, my opinion *is* valid,
like it or not.

That would surely suck. Show of hands here please from anyone who was
able to make it in less than 10 attempts and what was the group makeup?
I understand it is *very* difficult.

No, you don't. You muster the necessary force to get them through. It
can be done. I'm sure of it. Then, the more people you get flagged, the
more you have in the pool to help others get flagged. 

How did that first group of 60's manage it when PoP was first released,
anyway?

I never suggested leaving your friends and guildmates behind. Quite the
contrary, I have shown contempt for those who do that very thing. Your
guild should stick together and level up as high as you can and tackle
it again, and again. It's a tradeoff. You like the guild you're in
though it is not strong enough to get you all tagged, then just be
willing to put forth the necessary effort to get that way. Why does the
game have to be altered so that you can defeat any encounter you want
without doing what is necessary - get enough of your guild to sufficient
level or find some outside help.
