I can't think of a single mob it's possible to fear kite in the
"end game.*   (Note, a level 60 necro/mage/whatever
killing for XP/AAXP isn't playing the "end game.")

He's still wrong, of course.   The single biggest upgrade will
be for epic mages on raids.   Those pets (unlike necro pets)
have enough HPs to actually withstand AoEs and, buffed,
enough HPs to actually justify cleric heals.

BTW, anyone got a comparison between a high-level beastlord
pet and the mage epic pet?
