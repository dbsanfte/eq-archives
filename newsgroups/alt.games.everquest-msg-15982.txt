I don't see any point putting points into anything other than str. That's
the only stat that I can see immediate benefit. HP gain from sta is too
little, AC gain from agi is too little, and what does dex do, again? I never
notice my bard doing any better with higher or lower dex. Cha improves charm
so some people say, but nobody can prove it. So go ahead and dump all points
into strength.
