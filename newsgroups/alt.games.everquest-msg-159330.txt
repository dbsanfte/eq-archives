It's been interesting (sort of) to see all the questioning about if there's
gonna be Hallowe'en events this year and what they might be.

Over 2 weeks ago I picked up various of the papers around Norrath.  The
Halfling one remarked on the werewolves, the Neriak one had stuff on the
raising of a creature in North Ro, the Dwarven one had stuff on E Karana and
Qeynos Hills...

If you'd read the silly things, you'd have found out that the events were
coming.

You don't even have to buy the papers; I got all of mine by slaughtering
bandits in N Karana.  Guess the bandits are better-informed than the general
populace.
