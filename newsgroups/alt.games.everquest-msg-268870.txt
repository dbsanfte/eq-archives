Depends.

I think some playstyles are bad for the overall game -- in an MMORPG,
you can't simply argue that ones own actions don't impact the game as
a whole. See my above post -- if powerlevelling is allowed, "Monty
Haul Syndrome" sets in, and content has to be continually rebalanced,
something which is hard to do well in a ive game, resulting in massive
power swings, item and wealth inflation, "exploit of the week"
tactics, and other things that destroy the game.

EQ1 is pretty much doesn't exist below level 60 anymore. This means
the game is going to die, as there's little to attract new players. A
good part of this can be blamed on the fact that it's assumed you will
rush through all the lower levels, so there's no impetus to add or
enhance low-level content. The high-end players burn out, and there's
nothing to draw in new players.
