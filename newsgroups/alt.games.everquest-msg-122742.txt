Hmmm, last I checked, there isnt a class out there that CANT Melee in
some sort of way.  Even the pure int casters (WIZ, NEC, MAG and ENC)
get melee abilities such as piercing, 1HB, 2HB and H2H.  So by your
descriptions, there is no such thing as a "Pure Caster" as your
definitions would make ENC, WIZ, MAG and NEC's Hybrids. =)
