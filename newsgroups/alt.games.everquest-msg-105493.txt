I did time in skyfire, it was lower leven than you were, after burning
woods skellies and rillas became pointless to quad but before I was
doing raptors (must have been 53). It was blindingly slow. They have
so many hp.

You yourself say that you hunt other places. High 50s soloing, well,
you have wakening lands, cobalt scar, and great divide in velious,
along with lots of soloable places in luclin now. Skyfire just doesn't
match up, you can only stack winged death and (presumably) your bracer
or arm dot. Fights take forever. Medding takes forever. Though perhaps
there are more enchanters there than there ever were for me.

I give you that.

I took him to burning woods once (checked to see if he was up and he
actually was to my shock), and he refused to leave the zoneline. I
found that quite humerous. He had to be trained out again.

You said you were 58, right, so you have FoK? Out of the way, fairly
safe, no idiots - Wakening Lands, suits of sentient armor. They have a
lot of hp but are still quite quaddable. That bitch Rolandal got me
once just after he got put in (nice surprise). Other than him the only
danger is the one occasional panther that paths up there, but a career
soloer like yourself will be fully capable of dealing with jboots
speed adds during a quad I'm sure. I know you didn't ask for advice;
but I got to 60 (1) on those armors after the raptors went to shit,
and in between or while waiting for Charasis trips (the real best
experience to be had at that time, pre-Velks adjustment).

Anyways, though I forgive you for dissing my leveling speed elsewhere,
I am really truly shocked you would find skyfire even remotely close
to acceptable experience. It was possible to quad wyverns or spermies
but they didn't assist each other making a headache for when they get
low and stop chasing even though their friends still are, and they are
too spread out to be efficiently gathered.

(1) I didn't actually ding 60 on them, the servers were coming down
just as I got within a pixel. Deciding I only needed one kill I went
to LFay instead to rape a brownie guard which is a much easier faster
fight rather than wait to med up to do another armor. Ironically, it
didn't ding me, the guide told me to log out (I was almost the last
person left), and I got it the next day... on a brownie guard.
