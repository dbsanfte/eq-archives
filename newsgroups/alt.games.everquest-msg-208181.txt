My experience with NBG has generally been good, even in pickup groups.  I 
have recieved any number of items I could use based on the policy, and, 
have opted out on others for the same reason.  The guilds I have been in 
have always used it, and, generally it has worked well.  There certainly 
have been cases where it did not, but, they were the exception.
