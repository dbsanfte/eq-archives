Tongue firmly in cheek, so don't start rumors =)...

'In the upcoming patch, you will be able to purchase your character directly
from vendors for a set price.  For example, want to start a cleric at level
40 (to get to the "real" game)?  Check your local vendor in the Temple of
Marr.  For a base price of 50k plat, you get your lvl 40 cleric...for 10p
for point you can increase the base skills of wisdom, str, and agi, until
all are maxed at their appropriate levels.  For a special price of 150k
plat, you can start a 60 cleric maxed in all base skills and all AA areas
and immediately experience all of norrath in all it's glory (of course, if
you travel to the moon, you must start over or pay an additional plat fee of
50k).

We feel these changes will be in the best interest of the players, as now
there will not be that annoying time frame of actually having to explore
with a new character and learn new things about any given class.  Given
you've been around EQ long enough, you can now experience all class/race
combinations immediately, then decide which you like the best!

We are sure this will make it much easier for new players to get in the game
(once they buy their 150k plat from e-bay).  As an aside, just so there
won't be any unintentional confusion on the part of the new players, all
races can now be all classes, and all wisdom/int casting classes will start
with those skills maxed.

You're in our world now...although it might look a bit the same where you
travel!"

Be safe all,

Bill
