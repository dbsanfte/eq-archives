To all of you that have stepped in to answer me - thank you. Whilst I'm very
reluctant to throw away my efforts and go back to level 60, it does seem to
be the only way that I can hunt and see any type of reward at the moment.
I'm off to the stores today (I hope) and will be looking around for a better
PC - so hopefully I can get back on-track with getting to 65 ASAP. Thanks
again guys.

Kind regards ...

Stevie.
