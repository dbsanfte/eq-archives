I'm surprised he could figure out how. Remember this is the same
person who told us he couldn't figure out the spoofed email addies of
twenty four out of twenty five people in this newsgroup. :-)

Does prove he didn't actually stop reading the thread, though. He's
just afraid to post in it. Which *doesn't* surprise me. :-)

So the end results are the group has more bottom posting posts AND
posters. So, @ndrew was lying onn both fronts.
