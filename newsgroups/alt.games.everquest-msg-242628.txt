But I would bet it's a whole lot better than leveling up without ever
entering a dungeon! And imho when playing an enchanter without loving
dungeon crawls you've failed your profession. :) (hope that sentence
makes sense...) After all, crowd control is where the class excels.

And I strongly disagree. :) I don't want the '%t mezzed' spam for
informing the group which mobs NOT to kill. I do have it in for the
healers. So they know when to relax a bit since situation is under
control.
I mean nobody argues about slow messages. And you could trust me on that
too. :) Giving the healer this piece of information just allows him/her
to be as effective as they can.

I'd really appreciate that. I have a group of five people I played from
lvl30 onwards with. And in this group I can ask for overpulls and they do
it sometimes just for the fun. Granted I've wiped us sometimes but we
all like a challenge. And I wouldn't call a normal mob that. :)
