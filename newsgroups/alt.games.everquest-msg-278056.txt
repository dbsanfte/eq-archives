Stonebrunt? Never heard of it. Its probably too far from a PoK book to 
be worth going to.

Exploring? Gasp... I could have gained 2 yellows in DSP in the time you 
wanted me to waste exploring! No thank you, I want to be led around by 
the nose from safe camping spot to safe camping spot.

2 minutes later.

Where is Rathe Mountains? I'm in the Feerott. I'm lost. Can somebody 
come port me to Rathe Mountains?

20 minutes later.

Ok... Practically everything is green and light blue here. I'm lost. 
This quest is stupid. Can somebody come track my NPC, my track is still 
at 5. :(

Aw crap... something just jumped me. I died in rathe mountains 
somewhere. Can I get a rez please? I don't know where I died.

20 minutes later.

Ok. Finally found my NPC, thanks to the [cleric's name] who came and 
rezzed me.... and did the turn in. Can somebody come port me to timorous 
deep, lol. I've never been there. lol.

20 minutes later.

Sorry I can't keep up, my swim is at 5. Where'd you go? lol. I'm lost...
