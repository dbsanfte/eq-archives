When my monk turned 17 and got Feign Death. First time I tried it in 
anger, when a couple of mobs added to the one I was fighting... I FD'd, 
and all the mobs just up and left. My grin was so wide the top of my 
head nearly fell off...

Okey, I know that the good times won't last, and that higher-level mobs 
won't forget about me so easily, but in the meantime, life is good.
