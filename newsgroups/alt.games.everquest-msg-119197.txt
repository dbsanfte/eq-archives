Because it's easier to exploit with throwing weapons than lev/EB?

Instant Shurikens != componentless EB/Lev

No one even buys the components from newbies anyways, they're vendor sold in
the Shadow Haven/Bazaar/Fungus Grove area, and from that lady in EC

Higher demand, without compensatory higher drop rates.

It's really a random thing, I've seen more plate drop in Kael than any other
type.

Drop rates in Kael suck though, so about 30 hours /played in Kael for plate
boots, arms, bracer, chain bp, silk legs and leather bracer.

Obviously, I don't ever expect to have ancient spell, like I never expect to
have Levitation/Everlasting Breath, I'm saying that making Lev/EB so rare is
stupid.
