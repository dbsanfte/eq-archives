    -do kite groups. Pretty much any class can be in a kite group nowadays, 
just get a necro to pull/kite mobs and do dps or ranged dmg. Thats the 
ulmitate tip to powerleveling. you can go to PoV just about anytime day or 
night and get a necro to kite mobs in PoV. You can eventually morph your 
group into a more "standard" group with healer, tank, slower, DPS, but 
kiting with a necro and 5 of any other class will net you alot more XP than 
sitting around for hours in LFG mode.

/cheers
