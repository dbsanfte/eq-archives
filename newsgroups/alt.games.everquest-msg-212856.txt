Probably the best speed boost that doesn't require speed up/slow down
times.

Cheapest won't provide much of a noticeable speed boost at all. (And
if you don't kite and always group, why do you feel you require a self
speed buff, anyway?) However, horses do have the perk of medding
without sit aggro...

AC camp is a headache and a half with all the other people going after
him. Only barely worth the effort IMO.

They still exist as far as I know. If you have the money to blow, this
is definitely easier than the quest...
