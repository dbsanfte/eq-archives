No, I'm taken aback at the hypocritical double-standard being
expressed where I'm criticized for being an "armchair lawyer" for
saying it is a copyright violation by the same people who are saying
it isn't... Bizbee has been one of those very people in the past. If I
can't say it -IS- one without being an "armchair lawyer", they can't
say it -ISN'T- without being the exact same thing.

You mean like the cases where the RIAA was able to sue customers for
downloading pirated music? ( The only thing that stopped them was
blocking them from demanding download records from ISPs ) And the
people distributing and downloading the music weren't even making
money off of it. As I see it, this is relevant. It's a case of
unauthorized distribution of portions of copyrighted material.
