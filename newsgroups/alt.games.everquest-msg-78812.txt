Has anyone noticed if there has been any change in movement speed for races?
I ask this because My Wood Elf Druid has a hard time keeping up with my Dark
Elf and will lose so much ground auto follow will fail. There is only about
5 pnts difference in agility both over 100, the only other thing I can think
of it being is framerate (second PC is slower) but this happens in empty,
old world zones as well as Luclin.

Now my whine, anyone been to Katta Castellan, on Luclin? It's a city zone
between Twilight sea and Tenebrous Mntns. There are two problems I have with
this zone.
Point 1,  there is a precarious path that leads down to the docks level, I
nearly followed a guard as he apparently walked off the edge of it (it turns
sharp left at first and follows wall) upon seeing the path and knowing how I
can sometimes suffer from brief graphics stutters (especially my second PC
that struggles in many SoL zones) I thought I should use levitate to be
safe, Bzzzt, this spell does not work in this zone! Erm WTF is that about?
If I went LD on that route or even stuttered that has to be a 10k drop and
there is no means of safely negotiating that path. I have been fortunate so
far but it's only a matter of time, I should imagine.
Any ideas on why Verant would implement such a thing? It's not like this is
a platform game or even a game where not running it at over 100fps would be
a major disadvantage, at least not normally.

Point 2 is the path that runs around what appears to be a secure quay. It,
again, is incredibly high but luckily has water either side as here I did
suffer a frame stutter and ran off the side...there is no way out once in
that water...I had to send my druid down and, after a few attempts, perch on
a wall to port out both characters...great zone.

If you do have to negotiate that path and have a poor frame rate, look into
the corner of the wall and path all the time, this will keep your FPS up and
should at least keep you safe, even in LD.
