No power leveling.
No kill stealing.
No buff bots.

Those are more than enough good reasons for me! Of course, some people
might be upset that they can't PL their friends to L50 in a week, or
find the lack of "buffs plz" spam to be annoying. Some people like
cauliflower, too. 

You can still help anyone who WANTS your help...all they need to do is
scream "/help", and the encounter is unlocked, and you can aid. If I
hear someone screaming for help and I'm not in an encounter myself, I
always look to see if it's something I can aid in. (i.e, someone being
pursued by a bunch of mobs which are green or grey to me.)
