I have a level 17 Erudite Enchantress on Vazaelle. She's non-twinked,
has no guild and is short on friends. She's been hunting in Oasis of
Marr but is getting bored with it. Time to move on...

I've been to eqatlas and seen the hunting guide, but there are still a
lot of zones to choose from for my level. I would like some help
paring down the list.

My objectives:
Fight in groups, make friends, find a guild (want to avoid the
bring-your-own-group zones for now)
Get some good loot for a non-twink (Magelo profile:

Level up
Explore: See what this wonderful world has to offer, maybe hunt in a
different zone everytime I level.

Any suggestions?
