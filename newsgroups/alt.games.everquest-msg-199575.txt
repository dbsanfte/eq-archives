Get used to it.  I've seen it happen not just with KEI but Virtue and
Aego.
A group I was in recently, the warriors Virtue wore off, we all had to
wait for him to run back to Nexus to get another.

I don't think reducing the duration is the answer either.  You'd just
see these guys make people wait even more often.
