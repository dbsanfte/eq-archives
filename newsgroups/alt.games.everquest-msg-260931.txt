If I had it to call, I'd say you're overheating your processor.. If you have 
a AMD processor, I'd bet money on it.
First thing to do is check your bios.. in there you should see something 
like "PC health" or such where it will tell
you the CPU temp.. if it's anywhere near 60.. you're probably overheating 
when you go into EQ.. I'd reccomend
checking your CPU cooling fan (ie stop smoking around your computer, buy a 
can of dust off and clean the hell out of it.
Most CPU cooling fan varieties run around 5krpm.. if your's is running 
slower, think about getting a new one.. do you have a
case fan or two? No? then you might even be overheating the CPU on your 
ATI.. I know the 9000s are notorious for
overheating if you don't have case fans.. Just my 2cp worth.. I could be way 
off...
