Well to be fair to bards, when I said my rez list, I was thinking explicitly
to raids I lead..(which isn't raids with my guild).. generally raids i lead
(chardok royals, VS, juggs, PoF type encounters) we don't even have any
bards present.    I think we've got 2 60 bards and a 56 bard in my guild
usually on, but unless somebody specifically logs one of them in, we can't
guarantee we will have one.   Lol i remember 1 time we did Itraer Vius, we
had SIX bards in 7 with 7 or so groups total

Do bards get ae mez?

I didn't think Juggs were quite that high - Im sure glamor of k has worked
on some of the first Juggs you reach (before the door with the false wall)
and other then the big mfo, they all seem pretty consistant in damage/hp (ie
same level)

heh same.. if im with my guild, we don't even try and mez juggs... 4 juggs
pulls and you better hope you live (we dont buff till we are at the ramp to
get to trak)

Last time i did King, a 57 chanter was having a *really* tough time
mezzing.. he said king is like that, 1 day its a doddle and the next he
can't mez shit

Well he wouldn't have made it to the zonein.. we were in bartender room,
meaning the krups who spawn on that square pad outside chef entrance, mobs
outside necro, or mobs in uzo would kill him :)  It was pretty rough heh..
nobody else alive to heal (other then my fungi) and the bard too busy
keeping everything mezzed - everytime I was real low on H/P, he'd re-mez the
krup so I could sit and regen heh.    We did actually survive that day :)

rofl :)

I think the biggest misconception is due to the fact if i do a /who all bard
55 60  I might see 8 names a day...
