Yes and the best quest would be to run a long long way give something to
some guy who gives it back to you just to say add something from a long long

find that you arent liked anymore in that place.  Bleh... Lord of the Rings
is out at Christmas, and if anyone can screw that one up, they should be
crucified or enforced to live their life as a newbie in EC.
