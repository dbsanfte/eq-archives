Bahh hit the post button before i meant to.


Would you like to go out on a raid with a warrior with "Chimp" skills?
It takes ALOT more than 5 mins to learn how to effectively group. Ok,
the warrior doesnt have that many abilities to perform in a raid, but
that doesnt mean its anyone can just jump into a raid and perform like
a pro. It takes practice.

Trust me, ive played with "chimp" warriors before. Being a soloer, I
dont know if the OP ever uses taunt (doesnt really have the need at
this point), but taunt is very important skill to master, and its more
than just button mashing. An experienced warrior will know how long to
taunt, and not during the whole battle. Or knowing who the MA is (or
even what it is), and knowing when do attack a mob. In our guild - we
invited a long time member who primarily solos with a warrior and
harly ever raided, and OMG, what a disaster it was. He NEVER waited
for the MA to call the attack (even after being repeated screamed at
to wait), so aggro establishment was dicey. Or when the MA called to
switch to another target so the chanter could mez, he never did. OR
would switch to different mobs than the MA, breaking mezzes left and
right. I dont think he understood the role of the MA, and probably
felt bad for his actions, hes not a dumb guy, just never grouped much
before.

There are skills to develop groupwise that are just intangible that
have nothing to do with your character skills, its the skill of the
player behind the character that means the most. Like, not pulling
when the cleric is nearly OOM, tagging mobs from a FD puller, not
wandering off or having an itchy trigger. I could go on and on - but
you get the point. At his level now, many of these arent huge issues,
but soon will be, especially once he hits his 50s.
