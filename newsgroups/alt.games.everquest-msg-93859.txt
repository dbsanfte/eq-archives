Actually, Absor did post several reasons (Although I didn't read it) as to
why this was the case, and in fact, the stuff you mention was pretty much
the reasons why the higher price tag.

Funny thing is, no one really realizes who or what Guides are, which are
pretty much players themselves who volunteer their time to help out on
servers.  They aren't really GMs to begin with, yet people don't read the
thing about guides which is posted on the www.everquestlive.com website.

These are also the same people who don't read the thing about the naming
policy, or the reimbursement policy.  There are a lot of things that can be
read from looking at the stupid little eqmanual supplement in the EQ
Folder, or on the website.  What is even more fun, was listening to the one
guy rant about how Verant's programmers should be focusing on the crashing
bugs instead of the cosmetic bugs.  Let's conviently ignore the fact that
programmers aren't exactly knowledgable in all areas.

Anyways, I have been around for over 2 years in EQ...  I remember the
survey for the $50 thing.  In fact, I remember the postings following that
little survey, where people freaked and went, "HELL NO, I'm not paying $40
more for this!" and required a bunch of posts from Verant to calm people
down that it was a survey and they weren't going to do it.

And by it, meaning charging EVERYONE $50 to play everquest a month.  It is
REALLY entertaining how many people think $10/month is worth a bar of Gold
and entitles them to everything under the sun, including being an ass to
other players.
