Usual spell line up on my 67,288 Ranger:

1.Snare
2.Heal
3.Root
4.Fire Nuke
5.Cold Nuke
6. to 8. is situational,sometimes its Regrowth or a Damageshield,but
there isnt much demand,either there is a class which can cover this
better or the players need the buffslot for more important stuff.
When tanking (rarely) I mem "Tangling Weeds"(0.8 sec cast time short
duration snare) to hold aggro.
When pulling I either use bow or Jolt.

Conclusion:the Ranger in your little story simply "sucked".  =)
How can one not have enough spellslots or pull with snare is beyond
me.
It always surprises me,that I generate so small aggro with 5 procs
running at Weapon Affinity 5,even in pickupgroups with probably 
mostly Bazaar equipped tanks the mobs rarely turn to me,this 
changes the moment I dare to use a snare for pulling,even if the 
tank manages to get aggro from me,I have it back some procs later.
