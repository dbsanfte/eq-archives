If you turn the bread in at Voleen's Bakery in Qeynos, then yes. But please
note that the bread quest is given by pretty much EVERY bread merchant on
Antonica. There are people in Halas, West Karana, North Karana, the
Commonlands, Neriak, Freeport, Grobb and Ogguk who are in need of bread from
Jarlath. A similar quest is available for Faydwer (Kelethin, Ak'Anon, Kaladim
and Felwithe.) Faction is local to the bread merchant, generally raising you
with local merchants and residents while dropping the local rogues faction (the
dirty profiteers!) Ask around if Qeynos is not convenient.
