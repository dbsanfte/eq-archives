Even though i quit a while back, i still read Lum's page and saw you guys woke
sleeper. Congrats on that. Then I saw you were thanked with suspensions and a
guild disband.


Man. I thought I got f'd.

If you guys dont get your accounts set to free after this fiasco, I cant see
how you would pay them $10/month after this. But then again dropping a lvl 60
char would be rough.
