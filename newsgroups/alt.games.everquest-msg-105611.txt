Well, WIS casters ARE priests.  Two terms for the same thing.  I've heard 
both; we certainly use priest more often in my guild.

Pure casters are casters that aren't priests.  Also known as INT casters.  
I thought it was pretty common, but maybe Ben has probes implanted in my 
brain.  Basically, if you can wear robes (and aren't a monk), you're a 
pure caster.  You're also an INT caster.  The idea is that priest classes 
are at least SLIGHTLY more able to take a beating than pure casters.  A 
druid isn't a tank, but they take a beating better than a wizard.  As for 
bards, we're just happy to be here, taking all the solo spawns from the 
druids, and still loved in groups AND gangs. :)

I think pure caster is as accepted as INT caster.  If you only use INT 
caster/WIS caster you might not know the term, but in our loot calls 
priest classes means one very specific thing and pure casters means 
another very specific thing.  Necros are pure casters, they just happen to 
be really, really good at it.  :)
