We've gone twice since the upgrade and have had a blast. In an 8 hour time
period, we got 13 pieces of armor and quite a bit of experience...killed 3
of the mini's and got a friend his final piece for the Nature's Defender.
Second time, 2 BP's dropped in a 3 hour period...one made the shaman in our
group very happy. Both times, we had a group of 7 people. Definately a place
where you have to go and form your own opinion.
