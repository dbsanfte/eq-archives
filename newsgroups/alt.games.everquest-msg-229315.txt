As a soloin' druid, I've just got to say: WORD.  I soloed Elysians at
54 and, while quite a mana-sink, I found it to be decent exp, and when
the armor drops (be patient, a complete set takes a while), it is
excellent.  Elysian armor is a more reliable drop than the leathers in
KD...although they aren't exactly common, either.

Best (pretty much only) solo strategy: Snare, root, DoT.  Rinse and
repeat.  Clicky DoT is pretty much essential (Elder Spiritist Bracers,
for example), and a clicky root wouldn't hurt.  Neither would KEI. 
Root will break.  Often.  Expect it.  I took to using a lower-level
root to save mana, it will last a similar amount of time.  Don't worry
too much about the con...if you're patient and careful with mana, you
can take down a red.  It will just take a heck of a lot longer.

If you agro anything other than a disturbed Elysian, or if you pull
more than one, don't be a hero.  Gate your butt out of there.  Most
other mobs near the "Safe Valley" can summon.  They will inflict a
quick and nasty death.  You will *not* have the mana for 2 Elysians at
once.
  
Oh, and make sure it is a *disturbed* Elysian, and not a *corrupted*
Elysian.  Big difference.  Painful difference.

EQDruids used to have a good Elysians 101 hunting guide.  I'd
recommend checking it out.

Good luck!
