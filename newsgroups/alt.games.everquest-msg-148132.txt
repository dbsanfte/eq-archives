Actually, it seems there's a penalty for leveling up quickly.  Every
time I cleared a hurdle, Verant would come in behind me and
remove it, so those who'd taken a more scenic route didn't have
to bust their Asterisk getting to where I was.

I hit 51, they killed the hell penalties up to 50.  I hit 60, they killed
the hell penalties 51 thru 59.  I learned to solo low blues for best
exp per hour, they made it so the more amusing "group and kill
even con mobs" plan gives more exp.  I make a druid alt for a taxi,
they add the Nexus.  I make a bard for something fun to do and
they... oh wait, bard is still one of the most enjoyable classses out
there, better shut up!
