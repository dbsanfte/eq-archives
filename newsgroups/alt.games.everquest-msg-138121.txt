Is there anything important I should save practices for? Right now I have 
80 or so, I barely ever use them unless it was to gain a particular skill. 
I'll make sure I specialize in the correct category by using some (if 
necessary), but other than that I don't have a use for them. I let skills 
go up naturally for the most part. Are there skills that I might get later 
(or work on later) that are a pain in the ass where I'd be wishing I had 
practices? I'm thinking maybe trade skills or something? This is my first 
character so I'm not sure about any of that. Would I be wasting any if I 
put a few in to my 1H Slashing (since it seems to take forever to move up)?

Thanks for some advice on this :)
