Thats totally out of context though. It talks about selling 'additional
levels' (as in levels of the game, in this context), etc. Buying
additional content, like, say, an expansion pack. Its also a general
statement regarding 'publishers big and small', not SOE.

The SOE comment attributions were explicit about playstation. I agree,
there may be a slippery slope case to be made, but this aint it.
