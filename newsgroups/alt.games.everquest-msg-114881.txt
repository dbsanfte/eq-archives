You don't actively play your mage in raids, do you?  Or
is there another mage there for Mod Rod 2 duties?  As unglamorous
as it is, there are few more efficient ways for a mage to spend
mana on a raid than pumping out rods.  

I had my ranger buddy's extra pair of Imbued Granite Spaulders
on me while we were trying to sell them, when I saw the auction
mule of one of the big guilds selling a bunch of dropped mage
spells, including CoH, MR2, and TPP - my buddy let me trade his
shoulders (which we weren't getting any hits on at 10k for over
2 days of xp grinding) in trade for those 3.  I owe him big now, 
but it's worth it, as the extra mana they make will make our XP 
groups faster, and raids a bit more doable with the small number of 
high level clerics we have.

Now, I just have to get the last 4.5 blue to 55 before Wednesday's
CoM raid, we may need the G-Flux/CoTH trick if we lose our rogue
before the raid (again).
