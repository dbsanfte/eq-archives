1.  The poison lasts until you either zone or use it.  Even if the attack
is resisted, it still "uses up" the poison.  It used to be worse, the effect
used to be interrupted like a spell.  If you zone or camp without using
it, you lose your poison.

2. The poison will do 4xlevel +1 damage.  If you apply it at level 1
(huh? don't even get the skill then), it will do 4x1+1=5 damage.
If you apply it at level 20, it will do 4x20+1=81 damage.  If you apply
it at level 35, it will do 4x35+1=141 damage.  The only thing crummy
is that it caps at 141 damage, and normally I don't even carry regular
poison vials and suspensions around.

Poison is fun to use, although it costs a lot and can be a HUGE time
sink if you have to farm some components.  Although there is
a certain amount of fun to backstabbing a froggie for 1000+, hitting
him with a 370 DD poison, quadding him for 4x101, and riposting
him for 101, too...just watch that life bar D-R--O---P...
;-)

I've played 2 rogues 50+ during the last 3 years, and my alt rogue
just hit 250 poison skill 2 weeks ago.  It saves a lot of cash to make
your own vials, although to do any serious poison work you'll
have to end up buying components (which never lead to good
poisons) and vials in order to tradeskill-grind your way up the
skill levels.

Good luck to you!
