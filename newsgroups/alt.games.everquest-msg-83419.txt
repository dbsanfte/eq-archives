Warrior is about second place as the worst soloing class, behind
rogues. One strategy that I've heard some high level warriors use
effectively is to joust mobs with a real high dmg, high delay weapon.
You need some speed buff to do this, like SOW or jboots. Then you just
whack the mob with your weighted axe, or equivalent, then run away
until the weapon time recycles, then whack again. It's melee kiting.

You'd get a lot better experince just finding a group though.
