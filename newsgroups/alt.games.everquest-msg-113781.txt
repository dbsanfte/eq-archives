I always thought of this like most types of competition in the real world.
You cannot get better by pummelling people far below you in ranking.  By
this, I don't mean you'll improve by only the most infintessimal amount.  I
really mean you will not improve at all.  Furthermore, you may very well
lose skill, as toying with the weak trains you only to defeat the weak.
When a real challenge comes along, people trained this way often fold.

To overcome this, people serious about improvement get strong opponents to
pactice against.  Boxers, for example, have very skilled boxers in their own
right as sparring partners.  Ali would not have become any bit the better
fighter by pounding me unconscious 1,000 times or 10,000 times.  Neither
should your best char improve for killing 10,000 rats.
