It, up until a few weeks ago, was a skill that appeared at level 9.
The patch recently, however, changed it so the spell that previously
level-buffed the warder now summons it. The down side is the pet no
longer zones with you (which isn't much of a downside, since zoning
stripped all the buffs from the pet, including level, making pet
zoning a "parlor trick"... ) However, the spell costs less mana to
cast than it did prior to the change AND it casts faster. Net result
is you have a combat ready pet faster now.
