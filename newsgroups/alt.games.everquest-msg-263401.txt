Not really, artisan isn't a separate archetype at all. It's like a shared 
type that everyone participates in and allows everyone to have a separate, 
independent life as an artisan.

Yes, the boat trip provides an introduction to the mechanics of the game. 
You are not asked to choose whether you want to be a priest, a fighter, a 
mage or a scout, nor are you asked whether you want to be a scholar, an 
outfitter, or a craftsman.

Right, your first tradeskill quest comes from Dreak, the guy you are told to 
go visit by that guy who just asked what archetype you are. First you choose 
your archetype, then you're told to go do the tradeskill quest. Now you've 
been introduced to all of the possibilities. Nice idea.

> So you decide.  Is artisan an archtype?  I don't think so.

/agree

Who exactly is making the claim that artisan is one of five basic archetypes 
alongside fighter, mage, scout and priest?

And plenty here who do, too!
