Ya know Jazz, that sounds an awful lot like the "uber 'tude" you've
decried in others now and again.  Why shouldn't a player who actually
has a life outside EQ be able to participate in the "raiding" game?
It's not like it would require any particular genius to devise a
system wherein, for example, the player who is able to make 50% of
his guild's raids ends up awarded 30% of the quality loot that the
100% player gets.  This would still provide meaningful advantage
to the "always there" players (if in fact the guild needs/desires to
encourage that) while not freezing out the remaining 80% of the
membership (taking Lance's example).

There is one thing I don't quite understand tho.  If, as Lance wrote,
20% of the players in his guild get <all> the good loot, then why
in hell are those other 80% still in the guild?  Doesn't sound like
they (the 80%) are getting much in return for their contribution to
the guild.
