    Heh, there'd be no thrill for the folks trying to kill you. Especially
after watching you beeline all the healers first and take them out, then
corpse-camp the fools bound in the buff hall. And THEN you could go to zone
and defeat ALL attempts at CR! 8)

    High-end encounters are all about aggro control. Having one mob have
uncontrollable aggro would be disastrous. Although it WOULD be fun to kill
everyone the first time!
