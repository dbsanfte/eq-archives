    Yup - until they've beaten the dragon twice to prove that they can do it
reliably, we don't have to flag them. So we don't end up flagging them on a
mob they can't do by themselves. We've proven we can do the dragon reliably,
and we had first force and higher numbers that day, so the GM saw things our
way.

> You got loot on the other trials?  Not fair, we never do :(

    Three rooms is a cornucopia of loot. 100/100 melee shoulders and caster
rings, some goofy weapons, and spectrals - yummy!

    Because the GM said so. I imagine his rationale was "they got screwed
out of their GM-sanctioned shot at the mob by a game bug, and I'm not going
to respawn it for them, but I will make sure they get another shot with me
here to verify nothing odd happens". But never mind the other guild -
there's two other guilds in HoH, and they're being shut out entirely by this
agreement.

    Read above. The original GM set a rotation on this between us and the
other guild. I have no idea why a GM would do that in a situation where four
guilds all want the same trial, but there it is. And the GM assured us that
today (the repop) would be ours, period, doesn't matter what anyone else
wants.

    It is now! ;-)

    The zone the quest mob was in, PoN, didn't crash. =/
