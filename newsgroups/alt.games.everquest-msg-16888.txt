Actually, thats not entirely true... My female character has gotten only one
item, the rest i had to fight for. My male wizard on the other hand was
loaded with a dragoon dirk, a savants cap, and 210 pp when he was level 5,
when he encountered a nice high lvl wizard! That of course might me a
coincidense, but i can sure tell you that my lvl 25 shaman pretty much got
where she is on her own.

Also, since i reached lvl 25 and now am in the position to give out items
that i looted or stuff i don't want to lowbies, i do not make a difference
between male or female, i give to the one that seems the most in need when i
inspect.

The only advantage i seem to have had playing a female is that the male
characers in a group always blame someone else.... *evil grin*. Not that I
have done anything wrong, but females are generally treated with a bit more
respect it seems...

I think over 50% of the females in Norrath are actually piloted by a male.
On the other hand i do have a girlfriend that is playing, who has a MALE
barbarian warrior (cuz they are studs) and a MALE gnome mage (cuz she thinks
the females look weird) so who knows.... there might be males out there
played by females.

My 2 ?
