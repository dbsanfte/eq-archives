There was a post on monkly-business or thesafehouse yesterday, asking how to
pull Dain.  Somebody posted a link to a guide somebody in your guild wrote
James (forgot who.. not really important)

The guide seemed over complicated though, when it can be done in much
simpler steps.  I guess its just what your used to though

Btw 5 more Dains down Sunday night /yawn   Hopefully were done with this pos
for good, soon.
