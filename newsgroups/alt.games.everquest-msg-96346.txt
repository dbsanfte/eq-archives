I have to say that I kind of like having the hell levels.  It's sort of like
banging your head on a wall, it feels so good when you stop.  I never
considered giving up EQ due to hell levels, I did start twinks at times, and
play them for a while, but really, so far, none of the hell levels has been
that bad.  45 sucked, until someone told me about a great place for me to
solo my shammy, in a dungeon.  After 45, I flew through the levels up to 51.
I have been 51 for a few days now, and am about 25% through it.  I may
change my mind when I hit 54.  At my current rate, I see hitting 52 in one
to two weeks, depending on how much time I spend playing twinks.  I have
been spending most of my time either in SolB, or soloing in Scarlet Desert.
