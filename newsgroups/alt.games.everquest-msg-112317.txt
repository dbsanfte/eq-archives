If you have Luclin you could try the various Loda Kai bandits in
Shadeweavers Thicket. They drop the equivalent of banded with some
additional weight. You can also do the armor quests from the NPCs, it's
still leather but includes some stat bonuses. The hard part would be getting
through Paludal caverns at that level, you'll need an invis.
