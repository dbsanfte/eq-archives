The stalkers are dark blue to 65 minimum.

He would not be getting the high con bonus anymore, but, still OK AAXP.

There are certainly better xp spots, but it's really not bad AAXP, 
depending on what level he actually was.

As for getting AAXP, the rules for when you do and don't get xp are the 
same as for regular xp, an AA just requires about the same amount of XP 
as leveling from 51 to 52.

I sometimes have gone back to the stalkers when I feel like beating on 
something as opposed to root rotting when I'm soloing, have not been back 
since before I dinged 66 though.
