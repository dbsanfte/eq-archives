You know all the ladies wanna get with MB and they are always hitting me 
up on IM's.  If they seem cool, sometimes I chat with them.  Last night 
I was chatting with this little honey....here's the transcript -

-=bloodninja99=-: Baby, I been havin a tough night so treat me nice 
aight? 

BritneySpears14: Aight. 

-=bloodninja99=-: Slip out of those pants baby, yeah. 

BritneySpears14: I slip out of my pants, just for you, -=bloodninja99=-. 

-=bloodninja99=-: Oh yeah, aight. Aight, I put on my robe and wizard 
hat. 

BritneySpears14: Oh, I like to play dress up. 

-=bloodninja99=-: Me too baby. 

BritneySpears14: I kiss you softly on your chest. 

-=bloodninja99=-: I cast Lvl. 3 Eroticism. You turn into a real 
beautiful woman. 

BritneySpears14: Hey... 

-=bloodninja99=-: I meditate to regain my mana, before casting Lvl. 8 
Sex of the Infinite. 

BritneySpears14: Funny I still don't see it. 

-=bloodninja99=-: I spend my mana reserves to cast Mighty F*ck of the 
Beyondness. 

BritneySpears14: You are the worst cyber partner ever. This is 
ridiculous. 

-=bloodninja99=-: Don't f*ck with me bitch, I'm the mightiest sorcerer 
of the lands. 

-=bloodninja99=-: I steal yo soul and cast Lightning Lvl. 1,000,000 Your 
body explodes into a fine bloody mist, because you are only a Lvl. 2 
Druid. 

BritneySpears14: Don't ever message me again you piece of shit. 

-=bloodninja99=-: Robots are trying to drill my brain but my lightning 
shield inflicts DOA attack, leaving the robots as flaming piles of 
metal. 

-=bloodninja99=-: King Arthur congratulates me for destroying Dr. 
Robotnik's evil army of Robot Socialist Republics. The cold war ends. 
Reagan steals my accomplishments and makes like it was because of him. 

-=bloodninja99=-: You still there baby? 

-=bloodninja99=-: Baby?
