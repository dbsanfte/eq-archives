You miss my point, it doesn't matter why its wrong, or even IF
its wrong.

It only matters whether you think its wrong.

If its not wrong, then doing it may still be inadvisable, may
still be illegal, may still be imprudent, may still be
impractical... but its not immoral.

The more your descision on whether its wrong or not is based on
your own personal consideration of the issue, the more "moral"
your descision is.

Take it a setp further, it would be less moral to refuse to kill
because you once heard someone you don't know say its wrong, even
less moral to refuse to kill because you though you overheard
someone saying that once but can't be sure, even less so to
refuse to kill because you don't want to get blood all over the
lawn.

Morality isn't the only way to decide things, greed, fear, lust,
disgust are all also contributing factors.  But I want to isolate
only the moral part of descision making for the sake of this
discussion.
