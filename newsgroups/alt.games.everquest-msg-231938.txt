Well, heres the playing field

41 Erud Necro, hunting Aviaks on the Ogre Island.

Summon pet and buff, turn off taunt
cast Darkness on mob
Double DoT mob
Run a distance from the aviaks fortress...
figure enough space to Fear... Fear lands, mob Poofs
or better yet, disappears because I still have it targeted, and its
health is droping.
Mob appears to be far away enough where pet does not run for it.

I go to spot mob was pulled from (first tower), no mob there... hit
escape for some reason I dont know why so lose target of mob.

wait, no mob.  

Pull another mob..
Dark
Double DoT
Run,
Fear, POOF.... but again mob is still targeted.

wait mob does not wander back.

Pull another to experiment..   Dark, Fear...  notice I didnt run, mob
runs right to the Aviak fortress, so I FD... POOF, it disappears but
still targeted.

fear and dark drop, so I stand, 
Lo and behold the two original mobs (watcher and a seeker) decide to
notice me again from where ever they poofed to.  I am sure they are
the original two because they still had not regen'ed to full health
and the 3rd mob was a proven.

Now WTF is going on?  anyone having similar occurances.
