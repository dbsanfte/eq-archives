Thanks for all the replies. :) I think there was only one question
and that was about casters using AoE spells. While I can't say for
certain they weren't because I wasn't able to watch that closely,
it was made pretty clear from the beginning that AoE spells were
a no-no and don't do them.

It will be our third attempt the next time we try and just wanted
to make sure that the raid organizer has input from a lot of different
sources. Looks like it's one of those things that must be worked
around until it's fixed.

Thanks again.

Tracey
