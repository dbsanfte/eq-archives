Let me guess.  You always bitched at people who banked money on Free 
Parking too, right?  :D

Seriously, I know the "real" definition of the word, and there's no reason 
to be quite such a condescending snot, even if it is your forte.  Verant 
didn't put that particular rule in for game balance, IMO...they put it in 
because there was no profit for them in allowing player sale, and some 
degree of assumed liability and extra support cost.  The fact that they 
subsequently allowed account transfer at a beefy charge tells me that 
they've since decided to roll with it.

As for the pure letter of your definition, I've not done an auction, but if 
I did, I wouldn't be dishonest about it.  I wouldn't practice fraud.  I 
wouldn't do it in order to gain something valuable from someone else (the 
primary definition according to m-w).  I would be violating a rule, but not 
one I see as a rule "of the game", because I don't see "a game".  Games 
have objectives, and EQ doesn't.  EQ is "a toy", or "an environment", or "a 
MUD", but it is not much of "a game".

As for getting my ass kicked out the door, Verant owns the server, and 
Verant sets the rules.  Actions have consequences, and I wouldn't piss and 
moan over that one if it happened and I earned it.  What I don't understand 
is why you (and others like you) are so personally wrapped up in this.  You 
practically frothed at the mouth in response to this thread, and I can't 
fathom what it is you think these "cheaters" are taking away from you.  
Perhaps you could give us a better justification than "but...but...but it's 
against the rules!", because that one's really just not cutting it.
