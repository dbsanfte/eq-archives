What level? In what gear?  Compared to what classes? How many of them 
did you have?  There's not enough information here to definitively 
answer the question.

At low levels, just as much as anyone else, depending on gear.  Damage 
output doesn't start to diverge till 20 or so, and even then gear can 
easily mean the cleric's damage outpaces that of less well equipped 
warriors and knights well into their 40s.  There's a sharp rise in melee 
output around 44 or so, just when cleric's melee skill's cap out, from 
there to 50 (on Firiona Vie) or 56 (any other server) a cleric would 
have to be extraordinarily well equipped to be doing anything close to 
what even the worst geared tank is likely to do.  At 50 (56 off FV) 
clerics have access to their proccing hammer line, which spikes their 
damage output back up into the running again, but it falls off gradually 
over that to where over 60 they really can't compete once more.

If there were "real" melee dps people working, then the answer would be 
"not much" all the way thru post 30 or so.

Warrior HP should fluctate from full to 20 back and forth repeatedly, 
and has no real relationship to the cleric's mana bar; the latter should 
in the long run remain more or less stable.  If a cleric is capable of 
meleeing and still not using more mana than he's getting back in a given 
fight, then there's no reason for him not to do so; the alternative is 
to sit around at FM wasting potential mana regen, or nuking, which is 
worse on mana fluctuation than meleeing will ever be.  Add to this the 
fact that at 56+ the cleric gets a melee buff (yaulp V) which will 
nearly cut in half the loss of mana he'd see over over medding... or 
even improve it if he's in a situation where he's unable to sit.

The question is, should the cleric be doing melee at 20m, regardless of 
the warriors current HP.  This is a tough one, you have to look at what 
you are attempting.  If you are trying to kill a "boss" type mob, where 
once the fight is over its over, and how much mana remains is 
inconsequential, then the cleric doing melee might very well put you 
over the top, and sitting to med instead might not be enough mana to 
keep the warrior alive long enough to get the job done.

If you are doing but one of a long long series of fights, then I'd say a 
cleric meleeing at 20M is almost certainly doing something wrong; he's 
got no reserves, and somehow has dropped down, gradually or suddenly, 
80% of his potential.  If he knows a med break is coming, then this 
might still be in order, but if you intend to keep pulling, or will have 
to med just for his mana bar, then he's probably wasting your time.

Looking again at what I said above, I have to add  there -are- 
situations where you simply cannot sit down.  If you are indoors, 
there's really no reason why any cleric, any level, shouldnt go ahead 
and melee if he can't sit; he'll lose no mana by doing so, and by 
speeding the fight, even by a quarter of what the other melee are doing, 
he's at least saving that much healing mana.  With Yaulp V running, he's 
actually losing less potential mana than any other "hybrid".

Outdoors, the cleric should be on a mount, in which case turning on the 
attack button is the equivalent of dismounting and standing there 
looking stupid.
