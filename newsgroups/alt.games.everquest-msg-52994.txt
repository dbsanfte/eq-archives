You can run through Kael easily with invis.  None of the giants on the
main path see invis.  Once you're through Kael, head across Wakening
Lands to Skyshire.  Again, you can easily get through SS with invis,
but you really should get a key.  Once you enter SS you should be able
to find someone to help you pull the key-dropper to the WL ent.  Kill
him, loot the key.  Invis up, follow the map to the Cobalt Scar zone.
Basically, stay left except the 2nd T intersection you come to, take a
right there.  Hold key in hand and click on statue in pool to zone
into CS.  Once in CS, run to the dragon circle and pick up a CS key,
which will allow you to use any Velious portal.  Head to SG tunnel
(about p1000, p1580, p18 or so), it's about 20 feet under water, watch
out for the sirens, since they will charm you if they can.
The hardest part is getting across SG.  Right as you zone in there is
a path to the right, if you are invis and follow it about 20 feet, you
come to a ledge near the water.  If you look towards the left of the
water, you see 2 swirlspine seahorses.  There is a third one in the
tunnel.  You need to go in that tunnel, swimming near the top, and go
up as soon as it allows you to.  If you make it all the way to the
top, fall over the waterfall, then you can get out, follow the wall
and take the first tunnel to the left.  This will take you to WW zone.
The seahorses see invis, and they hit hard and stun.  At 49 they will
be red to you, so you most likely need someone to pull at least the
first two away.  If nobody other than you is in zone, I would
recommend waiting until other folks come through.  Nothing on the land
that you'll be running across will see invis, so what I do is invis up
until I hit the water, mezz or pull the two seahorses, and then swim
like hell.  As soon as you get over the waterfall, you're safe again,
reinvis, get out of the water, and run for zone.
I've heard that if you just stand in the first corner when you enter
SG from CS for about 3 minutes, you will be ported up to near the WW
exit, but I have never tried it.  There is a way to camp out and back
in that will put you up there, but since I've seen GMs giving account
warnings for that, I strongly recommend against it.  If you have
access to a druid or a wizard, they can succor you across the zone.  
Once you get to WW be very careful, there are often dragons and other
creatures right outside the tunnel, and some of the named dragons do
see invis.
