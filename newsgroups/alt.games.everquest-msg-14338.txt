Nor is the recipe available at EQ Casters, nor at Allakhazam.
Somewhat more to the point, the merchant in North Freeport who sells
pottery sketches for bakeware does not sell one for a bread tin.

Perhaps people are a little confused, as the bread tin is smithed, but
requires a ceramic lining, which must be made by a potter.

HOWEVER, it hardly matters whether there is a way to create a bread
tin through pottery, since ... THE BREAD RECIPE NO LONGER
WORKS!!!!!!!!

(Can you tell who just bribed a smith to make her a bread tin for 4pp
last night?  And then tried to make bread, getting the Do Not Combine
message?  My necro twink is gonna starve!)
