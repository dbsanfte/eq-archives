No, but I have heard bullets flying over head once. Took me a moment
to realize what I was hearing, but by the third one I had started
running.

A very strange sound, especially when you're far enough away from the
gun that the gunshot is fairly quiet and muffled, so you can really
hear the flying bullet by itself.
