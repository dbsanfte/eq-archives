Things like this astound me. Especially the icon thing. Ummm did anyone
like load up the game and I don't know test it out before letting the servers
back up?

Now I can understand some bugs getting by that may only show up in
certain special circumstances and that you can't possibly test for all
cases. But come on! Not something that you can fire up the program
and spot immediately.

This reminds me of when they implemented the /book command. Not
only did it not work it messed up the icon positions in the book.
Something I spotted with in 10 seconds of starting the program.
