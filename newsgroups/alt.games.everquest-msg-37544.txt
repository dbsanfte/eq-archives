Check the source and then try a link from the source code. 

Basically, this site opens 8 hidden frames all sending requests to 
clickthru porn sites.  The guy has set it up to make money from all our 
unique IPs going to and hitting his clickthru sites without us knowing, 
according to one of the sites he gets 8 cents a click.

Very sneaky and naughty, yet quite a clever way to get lots of hits. 
Would anyone like to inform the webmasters (I can't be bothered) as the 
terms and conditions state:

<<<<
1.4 Inflating Traffic - A member may not artificially inflate traffic 
counts to his/her site using any device, program or any other means. 
Members may not spam our insertion code, which includes the use of E-
mail, newsgroups, public messages boards, guestbooks etc. Members may not 
include our insertion code within hidden frames, meta refresh tags or 
pages that are not available to the public (ie: pages requiring 
passwords). Members may not use javascript to artificially inflate 
traffic.

Have fun guys :)

Andy.
