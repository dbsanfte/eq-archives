Something crossed my mind the other day.

I wanted to buy a Funghi Tunic and someone was selling one at a cost of
30kpp. 5kpp more than I wanted to buy at but what the heck was gonna buy it.
Xegony uses Gfay as its market place but I know other servers use East
Commons Tunnel.

The problem with my trade was the person selling was Kos to Kelethin and
there was no way I could carry 30000 pieces of platinum anywhere, made me
encumbered 790/70.

If he was not KoS it would be simple, i.e. we both stand at banker and make
the trade. But how does anyone carry this much platinum in high end trades
at East Commons? Long long way from a bank and it would be a pain to agree a
trade and then both have to run to NFP bank.

Will be good once everyone has Luclin and all trades shift to The Bazaar as
no one is KoS.

I think Verant should also come up with a storyline that brings to life a
spire in Velious, sure make life easier )
