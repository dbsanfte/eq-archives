    Except that for a short period, the religious restriction on scribing
Imbues was messed up. During that period I ran around and inscribed all the
Imbues on Caster's Realm's list of cleric spells - the only one I might be
missing that I could have scribed would be Imbue Amber, thx incomplete spell
list. (I had a newbie look for it for me on a visit to Paineel, but he
didn't find it so I assumed it really wasn't CLR scribable until a friend
said it was after the window of opportunity was closed.) The religion
restriction only applies on scribing, not on casting - so I've become the
guild's official Imbuer for gems. And I've also been able to help some other
experimenters looking for imbues that otherwise can't be found owing to a
lack of clerics of those gods - Bertox, Prexus, Quellious, EMarr.
