34 druid, 43 monk grouped make a good team but we've never really explored
much and were wondering which areas on all the places (luclin, vellious and
norrath) and my wife (the druid) doesn't like to do more than heal and buff
while she reads. Can anyone recommend any place as a good place to hunt or
just make money?

We are both a little strapped as I've never been able to make much cash, and
the druid's porting can't make money anymore due to luclin.As a result, I
don't have good weapons and would really appreciate finding out how to
afford the great gear i see on the young monks (like knuckleduters and
schissar wraps) nowadays.

We are occasional players.

Thanking you in advance!
