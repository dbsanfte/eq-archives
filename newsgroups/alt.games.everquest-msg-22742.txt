In fact,  In my observation and usage Kitty cat is simply used to refer
to a cat one is fond of.  I wouldn't use it towards a cougar that wanted
me for lunch.  I would use it for a pet tiger(if I had one).  Its a
diminutive  Like Joe for Joseph or Jim for James; kim or kimmy for
Kimberly; lisa or liz or liza or beth For Elizabeth.
