Yes, you can get EQ without a credit card. you can goto Frys electronics ( I
have seen there ) I have seen in the Burbank, Ca store. And get a Game card.
its good for 3 months (its about $ 30.00 UDS ) I am pretty sure they are
available in several other places. I just have only seen at Frys so far. You
pay cash there. I have not used a game card, so I am not sure exactly how
they work. But from what I understand. get the card. enter the number and
your good for 1 3 month subscription.
