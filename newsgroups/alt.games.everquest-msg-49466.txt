Contradiction is a the worst mistake to make in a discussion.

In reality, the comment of learning the game really only applies to totally new
players.  Those that have been there and back are in the class of cheating.  So
are those who "purchase" high level players through auctions.  The bottom line
in both cases is that they didn't earn their level and/or character, it was
given or bought.  The only difference between powerleveling and outright
purchasing a player is that one takes money and the other takes some time.
