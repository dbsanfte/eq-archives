    Named stuff does default to Name00. The name is the name you see when
you click on the mob, with very few exceptions. The number tells you how
many of them are up. If it's a typical "named" mob, then that number is
always 00 because only one of them ever spawns.

    You also used to get the truename when trying to trade with a mob from
too far away. Back in the old days, a friend and I would do this so we could
do emotes at mobs with the animation. You couldn't emote at, say,
an_orc_pawn12 unless you did /wave an_orc_pawn12. Right around the time they
changed it so you could emote at any non-PC by just targetting and doing the
emote, they also changed it so too-far trades only gave the common name of
the mob. Which was too bad, in a way - it was pretty impressive seeing how
many goblin warlords could be up in Lake of Ill Omen.
