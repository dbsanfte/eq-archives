We're a casual, family type guild. Finally getting to the point where
the people who reach their 60's aren't leaving for raiding guilds and
we're starting to slowly take on mobs that we didn't have a chance at
last year. So, here we are. Grieg's End. Hehe :). I know it's not
a big thing for some of you, but for us, it's a leap up the ladder.

We went last week but Grieg was not up. Instead, we took out the
Praetor without a hitch. This week, Grieg is up. We did great, IMO.
No problems getting to the 'porter, no problems killing the two
mobs in the porter room, now to pulling the 10 guards before we
can pull Grieg. First one, no problem. Next pull, we got two of
'em, still not a problem. Another one or two or three are pulled
and Bam! Suddenly there are four or five 'normal' mobs (not the
Shadow masters that guard Grieg) in the room. Since we were taken
by surprise, we ate a couple of deaths before finally getting things
under control and killing the mobs. We rezzed our two that died,
buffed, pulled another one or two guards and, again, we ended up
with a bunch of mobs in the room. This time, no good and we wiped.

When the first set of mobs popped in, we thought that people on
the stairs around the teleporter caused the mobs from the other
room with the teleporter to port in. We were very careful to keep
away from the stairs from then on, but we again got loadsa aggro
later on.

Any clues as to where those mobs are coming from and how to stop
'em?

Tracey
