Um, what necro in his right mind would use KEI?  Also, the IG's were
never separate camps - I was 37ish when I was part of a group that 
took all 3 (none of use over 42).  Amazing thing - a 34 MS1 pet 
(resummoned until I got an IG model) was able to tank one for quite
a while when the 2 healers went OOM.  Camps change based on how
powerful the group there is - as mudflation has gotten worse, camps
have either expanded, or lower level/smaller size groups have moved
to them.
