Dunno, don't care.  If they weren't, they clearly looted out of turn, and 
that'd explain why they aren't doing it nae more. :)

Just be aware that if you decide not to do it anymore at some point,

}> Sounds like we have a volunteer!
}/em kickes the dirt in front of her feet.  

The dirt hits YOU for 1 point of damage!

}   Yah.  Actually, I'm working on it now, and will post later today I hope. 
}You're a major contributor, btw.  I love cut and paste.

Keen!  And then ya can just add a link to it in your .sig after the 'how
