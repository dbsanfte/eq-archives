Is it that they think by crossposting into the everquest newsgroup they're
going to get anything but flames?  Are they *trying* to get flamed?

I suppose they probably are, but reading down through the messages, a bit of
fan fiction here, a question about clerics there, and then someone
posting an 'I hate <racial slur>'.  Christ, go spew your hate somewhere
else, like, maybe, a forum where the other degenerates might find some
value in your sputum.

Sorry, just a minor rant.
