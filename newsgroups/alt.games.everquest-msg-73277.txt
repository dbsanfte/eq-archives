Yes, thankfully, I do :) Actually, I understood what you were saying
yesterday. I think I've become a bit more sensitive in this area recently
because of a situation I've had to deal with which has me very close to
pulling my hair out or screaming. My brother has deposited his 37 year old
wife onto the household and she has an IQ of 72. It's extremely hard for me
to keep my temper in check, after more than a month of her and her Disney
movies.

With that, I feel I need to apologize to all for that display of temper
recently -- it's mostly a reflection of this situation plus reading the NG
and finding posts such as the ones we've been made to endure recently.

Thank you for the post, Brad. I didn't realize that the problem also
extended to the military.
