Bullshit.  How you can only make 10 pp a night (as you imply later) while a
single gem can be worth 200 pp is beyond me.   I suppose it's possible that
you're the only rogue unable to pickpocket vendor trash... but instead
methinks you're just not good at math when the errors can make you feel
better about being a selfish prick.

And I've never stolen from a mob I was fighting, yet I have to get accused
of stealing every time the drop rate turns to shit... and it's becasue of
players like you.  I'm tired of taking heat as a consequence of your
actions.

Then we're in complete agreement.   I wouldn't want to group with a jackass
who thinks its acceptable to steal from his friends.  1 gold piece or 1000
pp, or $20 real money, the amount makes no difference.
