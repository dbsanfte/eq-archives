That is good advice, but I'm in a bit of a fix myself when it comes to
checking out a guild.  How do you go about checking the rep of various
guilds? I am shopping for a guild myself, and the other day I was approached
by someone I never met and asked if I was looking for a guild.  RED FLAG.  I
asked a friend of mine about the guild and he said they had been around a
long time.  Hmmm I thought, why would an established guild recruit on the
run like that?  I looked them up and found a website for them (after a lot
of digging) and they are a pretty high level guild.  55+ for the most part.
and they seemed to have a pretty big membership. Now I am wondering why
recruit me at bare 50 and without even knowing who I am?  I contacted the
person in-game that was given to me and he offered to guild me on the spot.
No app or anything.  Does this seem strange to you?
