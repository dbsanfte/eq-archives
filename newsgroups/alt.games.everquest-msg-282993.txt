That is the Everquest Titanium Edition. It includes the first 10  
Expansions.

It cost 19.99$. YOu can be glad, if you find it in a local store. I NEVER  
saw any EQ Product in a local store. Titanium is only available in a box,  
so I have to pay about 20$ for shipping, too.


You still need the Prophecy of RO Expansion, that costs $29.99.
Ohh ... of course... you must not buy it. But when I look, where most  
people of my guild are, I found that they are almost all in PoR Zones  
because of good exp and very nice rewards / drops.


I was one of the people, who are mad. 3boxing ... And I got all expansions  
till PoR. When they released PoR, I almost quitted EQ (I was paying on a  
yearly basis. Bah ... That was a big error. One Account almost running one  
year!)

And SOEs rules that do not allow to sell the account. Idiotic. What a  
waste of monney: having 3 accounts running long time without me playing  
any more... I am looking inside some times but EQ is no longer that much  
fun (First people started to do these idiotic MMs all the time. Now they  
are doing PoR all the time (What I can understand more than these MMs!) I  
did much in the old world including trying some old world raid mobs with  
one group... found bosses who we was able to kill and others that seems  
impossible to kill. Was fun, but now we tried what was doable and I am  
bored again.)
