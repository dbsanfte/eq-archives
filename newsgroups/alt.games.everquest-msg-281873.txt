Simple solution.

As with the Hotbutton bar:

In the UI folders, make your own. ie: Mine

I copied over the Hotbutton XML file to the Mine folder from the Old
Default folder.  Look through Old Default folder and there's several
tga files to do with the spell icons.  Copy those over to the Mine
folder as well.

In game, /loadskin mine 1

You'll now basically have the new UI with the 2 X 5 Hotbutton bar and
the old spell icons.

No problem.  Unless they change the Hotbutton boxes again, I'm all set.
