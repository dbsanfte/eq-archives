And the reverse, under unusual circumstances in the game (eg, a pull
going completely south), I've been known to vocalise what's going on.
Now, this doesn't happen when I'm speaking to one of my housemates who
might happen to be in the room, but if I'm on the phone, for example
with my mother, things can get confused...

"And so your grandmother is out of hospital..."
"That's good." (slows incoming mob)
"...and feeling much better now"
"I should hope so." (drops a heal on tank)
"...and we were wondering what your plans for the holidays were..."
(notices massive number of adds, heals tank more, notices heals haven't
landed since the first mob is still targetted) "Oh shit, heal..." [1]
"What's that, dear?"
(click click click clickety click) "I really have to go, can I call you
back?"
[etc]

Indeed, there are some interesting studies into how closely typing
ability is knitted into the speech centres of the brain. Typing really
isn't that different to, for example, sign language, and that's a form
of speech to many people.

Cheers,
