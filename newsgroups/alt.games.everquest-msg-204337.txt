Ok, but if you are not confident in your clericing, stay away from
courtyard camps (or worse yet, the castle).  Single pulling in any of
these can be difficult.  At RCY, adds can be a problem when the mob
gets too close to the edge.  Then you have to deal with the harm
touches...nothing like seeing an enchanter sitting down on the pull
and taking the HT.

Aside from these though, the goo and rat camps shouldn't be too tough.

I (never played a cleric but I have an idea what kind of things make
your job difficult) would suggest just doing PoJ, as long as you have
a smart puller.  The sentries and lower level prisoners aren't any
tougher than spiders in Velks...and can be single pulled as long as no
one in your group is a moron.  (Like the level 51 who decides to buff
the puller as he gets back while the pull is still in the hallway
running past rats, guards, and prisoners.)  If you want some better
exp without too much fear of adds or trains, PoN treants, ravens,
spiders are good.
