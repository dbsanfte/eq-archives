I'd say it depends on whether the wiped group will be able to recover
quickly, and how much work it takes to establish the camp.  I don't know the
details of that particular camp, so I'll talk in generalities.

If the group has a cleric bound in the zone, and it's just a matter of the
Cleric running back to the camp and resing people, and that can be done
quick enough that the camp won't need to be rebroken, then I'd say the
original group should get to keep the camp.

On the other hand, if they are all bound far away, so no one from the group
is even in the zone, and after they get there, they'll have to drag the
corpses to the zone in, res, and then go back and break a fully popped camp,
I'd say it is up for grabs.

Everything else is in between. :-)
