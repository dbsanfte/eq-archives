I'm fairly new to this game, been playing about 4 months.  I only have one
player a level 22 Ranger.  Recently, I decided to explore Odus, because of
how easy it is to get there now that you can port thru Luclin.  Well, I
wasn't thinking clearly and didn't check my EQatlas maps before zoning into
Paineel, running down a tunnel and right off the edge of a cleverly
disguised cliff.    At the bottom of this cliff there is a level 50+ dungeon
and I know of no way to even get into the city, much less recover my
corpse!!  I have never been tweaked and worked hard for everything I own. Am
I just SOL or is there some way I can get my stuff back?
