First I've heard of this, are you sure the adventures aren't randomly
generated so you're at the mercy of the famous EQ RNG whether you get
the mission you want straight off the bat or after turning half a

I wish they'd use the SWG design where you are given a list to choose
from and can refresh this list until you get something that looks
good.
