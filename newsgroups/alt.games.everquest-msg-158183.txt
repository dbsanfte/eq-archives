Personally, I think /raid should have been a free feature -
given that it's not................

after my first experience using it, I'm not sure
I'd bother using it outside of PoP.  Raid xp is minimal, and
we had several problems with people getting bugged.

I know we've gone over this before, but have you tried 
using /viewport to make a clone of the old ui in the new?

If you're in 800x600 (the default for new ui I think)
Try /veiwport 150 0 500 400
This will give you a 500x400 graphics window, 
centered horizontally and on the top of the screen.
That allows you the 150 wide borders on each side
for things like group/player/target and hotkeys/
spells, with the bottom for the chat window.

Alternatively - have you tried the 3rd person
mode (the one 2 f9's from 1st person)?  If
you hit <Home> the view centers on you avatar
(pointing just a bit down) then <Delete> to
back up just a bit.

I play in that mode just because I don't like
1st person.  That might make it easier on you.
