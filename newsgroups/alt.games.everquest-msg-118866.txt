Looked into the Dell site and got a quote for a decent system she can afford
for 1200.  Got a printout of that and took it with us shopping.  Went to a
local shop that does custom jobs and he says he'll give me what I want
(almost the same as the Dell system) for 1100 but she has to pay for the
whole thing right off and she don't have quite that much cash at the moment.
Then made the mistake of going to a Gateway store.  Nice folks in there
but......couldn't give me a soundcard other than Soundblaster, and wanted to
charge 1800 for the system.  We left there in a hurry.  She'll probably
scrape the money together and buy from the shop we went to first.

Thank you all for all the great advice.
