>> Yeah. The armor tiers go approximately like this:
>> 
>> Newbie quested armor (or just plain banded)
>> Sol Ro level quested armor (crafted, darkforge, etc)
>> Twilight Sea quested armor (almost universally ignored)
>> Old EQ planar dropped armor (indicolite, etc)
>> Kunark dropped armor (cobalt, etc)
>> Thurgadin quested armor (quest drops in Kael)
>> Kael/Skyshrine quested armor (quest drops in ToV)
>> Cultural tradeskilled armor
>> Ornate quested armor
>> Elemental tradeskilled armor
>> LDoN pointbought armor
>> Elemental quested armor

Nod but both the 760 and 1400 point ldon armors are better than the
elemental tradeskilled armor but not as good as the elemental quested
armor (assuming fully augmented), and few people waste points on armor
lower than that, so my list holds generally true.
