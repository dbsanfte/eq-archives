No. EQ met it's potential, back when it was the king of the mountain. 
However, between then and when WoW was released, things changed. People's 
expectations changed.

WoW also had a number of other things going for it: The name Blizzard 
attached to it. A well-developed fanbase (Warcraft 1,2,3 plus expansion 
packs). Blizzards *known* ability to be able to take a genre and polish it 
until it gleams.
