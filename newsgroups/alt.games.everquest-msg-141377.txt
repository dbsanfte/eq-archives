You could probably get the spell cheaper, I've seen it sell for 7k on Xegony
at times.  The thing is you may use it like the first day or two, but you'll
soon find out your pets lvl 25 and doesnt seem to last long when soloing.  I
only use mine when groupped and I hardly ever still cast that spell.  So if
ya gonna burn 20k...I'd try to get a Velious BP mq'd to ya for that or
something of that matter.  Cause the bear is pretty useless at 55 when ya
wanna hunt for exp. Just my opinion.
