I'm assuming you meant "-no- more use[less] spell line" (rather than the
"useful" you posted).  Anyhow, I do not know how they used to figure
whether you would get agro or not (when they changed the spells they
claimed that now CHA affects that chance), but I found that the further
away I was from the mob I targetted the less likely I was to get agro.
So I always figured that on a resist it was increasing the mob's agro
radius, either by a variable amount from the base or by a smallish but
cumulative amount.  Since you need LOS to cast it (still do, I assume)
that limited its use to places where you could see the mobs from near
the limit of casting range, unless you liked to get agro'd a lot.


I certainly never had results that even vaguely close to the "use it
to pull" comments others made about it, but then I only used it in
places like FM giant fort (and can't recall any other place where it
was actually useful).
