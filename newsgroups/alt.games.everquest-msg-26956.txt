Having been on several epic level raids I would suggest that this is
not the case - the most important class seems to be the enchanter - if
the enchanter dies then the group is in a lot of trouble, the
combination of a chanter ( speed up and crowd control ), monk for
damage, rogue for damage, shaman to slow, warrior to take damage and
cleric to heal is very powerful.  Shaman on high level raids are less
likely to be healing and more likely to be slowing.

For high level mobs like dragons etc - then the focus would be on
doing as much melee damage to the mob in the quickest time - and it
has been seen through the recent class balancing that Wizzies have had
to be boosted some to fit in.

Clerics do become the main healers for groups and raids from about the
mid 30s and the ability to rez is important too.  Shaman have a
different route to take - buffing and slowing - they get the best slow
in the game and that really does make a difference.  If you imagine
that a mob is hitting you 4 times when you are trying to cast a spell
then the slow effect makes this once so the interupts drop to almost
nothing.

However shaman and druids are good to have about for backup healing
and buffs.
