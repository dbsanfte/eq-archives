    By item can give people ideas as to what to do with their own character.
It also gives them an idea as to how you compensate for various things. "Ok,
no HPs on the CBB, but he makes up for it here!"

    Here's my level 40 shaman:
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370544

    I have some AC 16 5 most melee stats 25 HP/MANA gloves I need to move
over to her, but otherwise the Magelo is dead on. Right now looking for
better boots and shoulders, she has Thurg faction so I'm leaning towards
Thurg MQ boots. She'll get my Skull Charm as soon as Delores gets a new
bracer or earring (I have a wrist/ear item that really should be an ear
item). I've looked at a few mana pres-type items, but none of them really
fit my vision of Cyndi as a tank-mage (or are in the price range). She also
doesn't go down much in mana if I bother to buy her KEI. The best part about
having all the "recommended level" items is every ding adds a fair chunk of
power to her. It's exciting to level up!
