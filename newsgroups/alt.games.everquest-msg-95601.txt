That's how it used to work when EQ first come out... when you LD you can log
right back in to the char without char selection screen. But one day VI
decided to "FIX" the FD pull.... that is when a Monk/SK pull too much they
FD, /q then log right back in. VI think it is too EASY to pull like that so
they put in codes that your char HAVE to be gone from the server before you
can log back in again. They mess up pet user and no rent item for a few
month before we can get them to add a timer on no rent item so you don't
lost it right after you LD.
