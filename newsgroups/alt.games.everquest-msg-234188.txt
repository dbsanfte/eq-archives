<Brenlo> Welcome to the EQ Live Chat. We would like to thank you all for
joining us here tonight. Tonight's topic of discussion will be Gates of
Discord, we will be covering Gates features and answering Gates questions.
If you would like your question to be responded to, please stay on topic.
<Brenlo> Private message me with questions you would like to suggest.
<Brenlo> Joining us for this chat are, Paul Carrico, Brain surgery victim
and Assistant Lead Designer, Jason Mash Assistant Lead Designer (and monkey
boy) Ryan Barker the Spell Guy (just for you Magicians), John Troy,
Designer, Oliver J. Smith Lead Designer and holder of the Nerf Bat, Jamey
Ryan Lead Programmer and Bard breaker, Todd Schmidt Assistant Lead
Programmer along with special guest, John Smedley.
<PCarrico> Thanks for coming everyone. I am Paul Carrico, an assistant lead
designer on EverQuest Live.
<Rbarker> Hey everyone thanks for coming! I'm Ryan Barker, systems designer.
<JMash> Hi everyone, thanks for coming! I am Jason Mash, an Assistant Lead
Designer on the EverQuest Live team.
<jtroy> Glad to see you all here. I'm John Troy, designer on EverQuest Live.
<OSmith> Hi everyone. I'm Oliver J. Smith, the Lead Designer of EverQuest.
Welcome to our chat.
<Hobart> <----- Todd Schmidt, Ass. Lead Programmer. Test Server Guy!

<Brenlo> <west02> Is buying the expansion in the stores going to give you
anything like LDoN did?
<jryan> Hey all, I'm the Lead Programmer on EverQuest and the controller of
the fun factor(haha)
<OSmith> Yes. If you purchase the boxed copy of Gates of Discord you'll be
getting an in-game item on launch day. This item will have a completely
unique look.
<Smed> <----- John Smedley, President of SOE and giver-outer of Fiery
Avengers
<Brenlo> Welcome Smed!

<Brenlo> *Lisa_Veeshan* What is the concept behind the progression in GoD?
Will it be like SoV where we work with 3 different factions? Or like PoP
where we follow a storyline?
<OSmith> Please excuse the amount of time it takes to answer these
questions. We're answering them as quickly as we can.
<PCarrico> The storyline continues the saga of the wayfaring brotherhood
which was introduced in Legacy of Ykesha. You will be helping them explore
the newly found continent of Taelosia. There will be a small amount of flags
earned through the storyline but nothing as in depth as Planes of Power. The
flags are directly related to the storyline but are a lot more forgiving
than they were in the Planes of Power.

<Brenlo> *depen_hoss* Will the 2nd installment of the melee revamp go live
with GoD?
<Rbarker> Another segment of the melee system is going to be going live with
the next patch. It's not specific to Gates though. There's further additions
to the melee system planned for the near future.

<Brenlo> *LokshaldBrel* there are going to be 10 instanced zones, will there
be points like LDoN, and will those points work in conjuction with LDoN
points?
<jtroy> No, the items in GoD will all be dropped and quested. The instanced
zones will just allow multiple groups to experience some of the same content
without blocking each other out.

<Brenlo> *Rilraak-Xev* Will GoD be the last expansion in EQ1?
<Smed> No way. Big, big stuff planned and being worked on.
<Smed> we've done a major engine revamp and plan on making that the basis
for a lot of cool new stuff

<Brenlo> *Raxinie* What is the targetted level range for GoD?
<jtroy> Everyone will gain access to some of the new features, like
Leadership Abilities and the Tribute system. The content is geared for 55+
characters, with quite a bit of it aimed at level 65.

<Brenlo> *Destructive* The battle cry line of effects looks very interesting
and there is alot of speculation about how it actually works. The most
common rumor is that it provides a type of over haste for the entire group
that stacks with all other hastes. Can you please give us some insight on
how the battle cry actually works?
<Rbarker> The battle cry abilities do indeed provide a form of "overhaste"
as well as an increased attack rating that will benefit the melee abilities
of the entire group for a short time. It's just one of the advantages to
have a berserker as part of your group.

<Brenlo> *Dyster* Will we be able to use our old no-drop items that are
sitting in the bank as tributes for the new tribute system?
<OSmith> The tribute system does not allow no drop items to be turned into
Tribute Masters for favor points.

<Brenlo> Smed, where do you see EQ going in the future?
<Smed> With EQ II coming out a lot of people have the idea we aren't going
to continue to support EQ
<Smed> the truth is it's going to continue to be a major part of SOE's
future
<Smed> and we plan on leaving the Dev team to make expansions for a long,
long time
<Smed> but we're not going to rest on our laurels.. we're going to push
things from the design and technological perspective
<Smed> and our nerfing days are behind us
<Smed> all the people in this room swear

<Brenlo> *Jerle_Minara* Do the Berserkers currently have an Epic/have a
planned Epic?
<PCarrico> I tested the Berserker Epic quest yesterday and it is a great
piece of lore. Everything is ready for it to go, including a new awesome
looking weapon. Additionally the Berserkers have all content added for them
which is ready for release; Planar drops, Ornate Armor, Newbie quest armor,
etc..

<Brenlo> *Gorthag-ED* Is there any chance that the percentage of exp going
towards leadership points will be adjustable, so that once a player fills
out all their AA exp, they can put all earned exp into Leadership? (Or
sooner, if they'd rather gain Leadership points than AAs)
<jryan> The leadership experience does not work the same way that AA
experience works.
<jryan> Leadership experience is earned based on a variety of factors
including the diffculty of the mob and how many players are in your group or
raid.
<jryan> There is slider for leadership experience like there is for AAs.
<jryan> There is no slider for leadership experience like there is for AAs

<Brenlo> *shaman* My question is Will the new tradeskill quests be anything
as complex as the Prayer Shawl or Solstice Earring quests for us tradeskill
junkies.?
<JMash> There are quests for almost every tradeskill in Gates, though they
aren't as intensive as the shawl quests, they should prove to be beneficial
and fun.

<Brenlo> *tearabite* what is leadership experience? is it like AA?
<OSmith> Leadership Experience gives the leader abilities that can be used
in group or raid settings. There are several different abilities that the
leaders can choose from. The system itself is similar to AAs, but the
experience that is gained can only be gained by leading a group or raid.

<Brenlo> *kizh* will GoD take a while for a guild to progress through like
PoP, and for guilds that are about ready to leave Time can you see them
living in GoD entirely?
<jtroy> Yes, Gates has multiple zones designed for progression for guilds
that are now in the Elemental planes or the Plane of Time.

<Brenlo> *Zanthus* When will the new trade interface we introduced?
<JMash> The tradeskill interface will be released as a live feature with the
update on February 10th.

<Brenlo> *buck* can you give us the final races that will be able to be
berserkers?
<PCarrico> The races that can become Berserkers are Troll, Ogre, Vah Shir,
Barbarian, and Dwarf.
<OSmith> Feel free to continue sending your questions to Brenlo.

<Brenlo> Smed, what is your position on the Yantis/IGE issue?
<Smed> We have made our position on this issue very clear
<Smed> we don't endorse the idea of selling items or characters
<Smed> it's a violation of our EULA and more importantly it's not in keeping
with the sprit of EverQuest
<Smed> We are looking into this further and but don't expect us to go this
way with EverQuest
<Smed> and no, we do NOT condone it

<Brenlo> *Ceryk* What can you tell us about the Berserker's summoned
throwing weapons as far as abilities and such go? And how much money can
Berserkers expect to spend on maintaining a constant supply of components?
<Rbarker> The berserker axes are meant to give berserkers a bit more depth
to their abilities. The basic axes are set up to provide a decent amount of
ranged damage, although less then ranger archery. They also have a few
special techniques that allow them to throw their axes at specific parts of
their enemy to debilitate them. Examples include a short duration stun, and
a snare, with the possibility of others in the future.

<Brenlo> *PoekenInny* Will the graveyard zone go live with GoD?
<OSmith> The planned graveyard zone will not be going live with Gates of
Discord. It'll be released in an upcoming live update.

<Brenlo> *Kretol* About how fast can we expect our leadership experience to
rise? Is it sort of like AA *in that regard*, or will it be faster/slower?
<jryan> The leadership progress will be unique. We have made an extra effort
to make sure players feel they are progressing.
<OSmith> Please continue to send your questions to Brenlo. However, make
sure to stay on topic -- Gates of Discord.
<Brenlo> Folks please stay on topic. Questions about Class balance will not
be addressed.

<Brenlo> *Rylena* Will new spells be quested, dropped, vendor solds, or will
they be via a PoP-like system (runes/parchments)?
<Rbarker> A few of the spells will be drops directly off of mobs, while
there's also a few that will be available via a pop style turn in quest.
Although there's one spell per class, per quest, so you won't have the
repeats like you did in PoP.

<Brenlo> *Mordant-Dro* The benefical rewards from tradeskill quests- do you
see these as being similar to marr cherries for the kejans, or quest that
will have broad apeal and be worthwile to a large portion of the playerbase?
<JMash> Without going into too much detail on exactly how the quests work...
The tradeskill quest rewards will offer benefits with a more broad appeal
for both the tradeskiller and the consumer of tradeskilled items alike.

<Brenlo> *Dubyah* what kind of transportation (old world boats? planar
books? wizzy ports? druid rings) allows players to travel to the new
continent?
<PCarrico> There will be a new shuttle that will take players from Nedaria's
Landing to the ship city located in Abysmal Sea. Farstone magic is also
available in the Wayfarer camps that will let you teleport from any Wayfarer
camp to Nedaria and also to the beach area of Taelosia, Natimbi beach.
<Smed> What was that? A question about raising level limits after G.O.D?
<Smed> no comment
Action: PCarrico cries.

<Brenlo> *Firriann* will the new GoD zones will be like the LDoN zones? or
will we be able to change groups on the fly, more like the old dungeon
crawls of the old worlds?
<Brenlo> Someone is impersonating Smed. Call the authorities
<jryan> We have provided functionality to add and remove group or raid
members after the instance zone has started up to a point. Once you get
passed a certain point, you will no longer be able to.
<Smed> stay tuned

<Brenlo> *nurok2* What levels is the tribute system supposed to be usefull
for
<JMash> The Tribute benefits will be available to all players, beginning at
level 10.

<Brenlo> *JohnGaltSS* for that matter, will new disciplines need to be
quested after like spells, or readily available on vendors?
<Rbarker> There aren't any new disciplines going in that are specific to
Gates. If you mean the new combat abilities then yes they'll be available in
a similar manor as spells are. So quests and drops.

<Brenlo> *tearabite* Are berzerkers a pure melee class or will they be a
hybrid such as Paladins or Shadow Knights? Also, will Gates of Discord
contrain newer spells for existing classes?

<Brenlo> *Lorindar* will there be any changes to current trivial levels or
skill progression with the new UI?
<JMash> There are no plans to make any large scale changes to current
trivial levels or skill progression to any recipes due to the introduction
of the new Tradeskill Interface.

<Brenlo> *Jaeden* What is the motivating factor for the increased price for
AAs in GoD?
<jtroy> You can gain xp at a much faster rate nowadays than you could when
PoP was released. The increased group bonus, higher zone mods and
availability of high level NPCs all mean you can gain AA's much faster now.
The higher costs reflect that.

<Brenlo> *Rhubeus* Gates of Discord being a new expansion, any new servers
to launch with this release. New Rulesets seem to be the buzz lately with
Discord taunting folks with a new twist in EQ gameplay
<Hobart> Berserkers are considered a pure melee class. They don't get spells
similar to hybrids. They also have the option of using throwing as a primary
form of damage along with 2 handed weapons.
<OSmith> There are no plans at this time to launch a new server with the
release of Gates of Discord.

<Brenlo> *waldina* are you Brenlo the Moderator today?
<Brenlo> Yes I am!
<PCarrico> There will definately be a continuation of the lore that started
as far back as Planes of Power. You will have to play through Gates of
Discord to see what Morden has in store

<Brenlo> *VaylinIs1337* Will we see any advancement in EQ lore? Will that
ugly barbarian Morden Rasp return the stolen stone? Will the valiant trolls
reclaim their homeland?
<Brenlo> Reverse that order please.
<PCarrico> Me response was for Vaylin

<Brenlo> *jhazard* will there be new spells for existing classes?
<Rbarker> Yes there's several spells available in Gates for each of the
existing classes.
<Rbarker> Gates is actually signaling the return of Ancient type spells if
you haven't heard it around on the messages boards already >

<Brenlo> *Aelenadrinal* Are zerkers going to be limited specifically to
2Hslash weapons with Axe graphics only?? Or will a selection of 2Hslash
weapons be useable?
<PCarrico> Berserkers will be able to use any two handed weapons, this
includes two handed blunt weapons and two handed piercing.
<Brenlo> Jason Mash can you tell us some of the effects you can gain from
the Tribute System?
<JMash> The benefits that you can expect to see from the Tribute system
include effects that can be used to increase health and mana regeneration,
vision enhancing effects, among other beneficial effects.
<Brenlo> Smed any word on community message boards for EverQuest?
<Smed> Absolutely. We are going to be reopening the EverQuest community
boards on a MUCH broader basis in the near future
<Smed> and the Devs will be around daily to answer questions on these boards
<Smed> and they will be free

<Brenlo> *Corae* will leadership experience have a separate bar, as AA
experience does?
<jryan> Yes, leadership experience will be a unique way to advance your
character independent of AAs and you regular experience.

<Brenlo> *halindrome* Is there a new druid ring?
<Rbarker> Yes there's new portal locations on the new continent for both
druids and wizards. There's also a magus that will teleport you to the new
lands if you happen to be on good terms with the Wayfarer's Brotherhood.

<Brenlo> *Govaleo* Will the Taelosians be hostile to evil races or good and
will they be added as a new race in future expansions?
<PCarrico> Taelosians will be dubious to players when they arrive on the
continent. They have been seperated from the races on the known continents
for so long that they do not have any past history to base their
preconceived notions on.
<PCarrico> There are no plans to add them as a playable race at this time.

<Brenlo> *doddil* will the tribute system be limited to people with deities
only, because having just clicked through at the beggining, im already
screwed for my armor and not being able to get the cheap good stuff like
fierce heraldic, and i am forced to save up for ornate
<jtroy> No, the tribute system is available to everyone.
<Smed> <cough>
<Smed> um

<Brenlo> *HellChild* is SoE and EQ staff scared of what Blizzard is bringing
to the table ?
<Smed> well.. let's dodge that question for now
<Smed> the designers all want to
<Smed>

<Brenlo> *curtree* What type of zones are we in treat for? Outside? dungeon?
If outside, what type of scenery?
<OSmith> Gates of Discord will have a variety of zone types available. At
the start of the expansion players will find themselves on a large ship
city. From there they'll be able to move through an underground sewer system
that'll target small group settings. Further in the expansion players will
find themselves in a temple area that'll specifically target raids.
<OSmith> Everyone will be able to see indoor zones, outdoor zones, and
underground areas as they adventure through the Gates of Discord.

<Brenlo> *azezel* What kind of abilities can we expect to see with the
Leadership expirience system?
<jryan> There are abilities such as visually marking multiple NPCs, gaining
health or mana enhancements for your group or raid, and regen enhancements.

<Brenlo> *Garlin* will adventure points from gate of discord differ from
those of Ldon? or will they all tabulate togther
<jryan> There are no points for the instance zones in Gates of Discord. They
do not carry the same restrictions that LDoN zones did.

<Brenlo> *Vermourn* is the berserkers "berserk" power going to be structured
as a combat ability like lay on hands, or as a personal spell buff?
<Hobart> The new berserker skill is called Frenzy. It is an actual skill
attack and is not a buff.

<Brenlo> *Rathelon* Will GoD instanced zones be timed?
<jryan> For all intense and purposes, no.
<Brenlo> Okay folks, we are only taking 2 more questions.

<Brenlo> *Rynthemage* What difficulty level are GoD raid zones tailored
towards? (VT, Elemental, Time or beyond)?
<jtroy> There are some encounters tailored for the Vex Thal level and
several zoned tailored to be difficult for Elemental and Time equipped
characters, with correspondingly better loot.

<Brenlo> *Tounces76* How long will "Tribute" buffs last, and do they
auto-recharge themselves?(Aka deduct more pts to refresh)
<OSmith> Every ten minutes favor points will be deducted from your favor
pool. Different tribute buffs require different favor costs. Your buffs will
last as long as you have favor points to pay for them.

<Brenlo> *XaX* is GoD equipment a big upgrade from time level equipment?
<PCarrico> There is definately equipment on Taelosia that is an upgrade to
gear that can be found in time.
<Brenlo> By the way we do have some exciting news. EverQuest is about to get
even better as we make changes to the EverQuest engine which will allow us
to provide you with the great game you have enjoyed but on a much more
stable platform. All you have to do is install DX9 and we will do the rest.
<Brenlo> Now a note for those of you that have not yet joined us in the 21st
century, you may find that your older video card will not be compliant with
DX 9.
<Brenlo> If you find or suspect that your video card is not DX 9 compliant,
you can go to your manufacturers website or visit the EQ Tech page (On
Eqlive.station.sony.com) and check for any issues and the latest known
drivers. Also stay tuned as we are putting together a deal with Nvidia and
eVGA.com to give current EQ Subscribers access to discounts on several
different Nvidia powered 3d accelerators.
<Brenlo> Remember every one of you will want to have your latest video card
drivers ( No Drivers from 6 months ago are most likely not the latest
drivers).
<Brenlo> Thanks for coming everyone. We hope your questions were answered.
If you would like to know more about Gates of Discord, you can go to
www.gatesofdiscord.com.
<Brenlo> Thanks all and have a good night.
<OSmith> Thanks for coming!
<Rbarker> Thanks for coming everyone, I hope our answers were informative!
<PCarrico> Thanks for coming all.
