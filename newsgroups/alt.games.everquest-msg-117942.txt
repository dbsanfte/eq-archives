Paul,

My wife and I had similiar problems, several times over the past few years.
For a while if either of us entered the same zone with the other we would
either crash or experience extreme packet loss.  That one turned out to be
wrong settings on our IP addresses causing a conflict.  For some reason, the
settings would occassionally just change on their own.

The IP Address for each individual computer on your network may need to have
different assigned address numbers following the last decimal.  ie .100,
.101, .102


With XP, we just let XP do the setting up.

A few months ago, we began experiencing general packet loss when both of us
would be on at the same time, the zone mattered not.  That turned out to be
a bad router.

Good luck...this is the most frustrating problem I can imagine.  Tech
support at all levels pass the buck.  If you talk to enough of them,
eventually you might get the problem fixed.
