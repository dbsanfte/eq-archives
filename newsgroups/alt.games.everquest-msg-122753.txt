You forgot to include monk as a solo capable class. Easiest to solo with is
(easily) the druid. As a downside, druids are the least desirable class at
high levels for groups, unless the need a snarer or evacer. Mage, shaman and
monk are all (since the patch) good group classes. Many groups will want a
monk for pulling.
