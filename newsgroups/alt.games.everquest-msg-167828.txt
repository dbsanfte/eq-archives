There are some theoretical ways that were laid out quite a while back.
I'd like to see a PvP game where faction is *thoroughly* integrated.

A simple partial example:

Game keeps track of the following at the start of a fight - who
attacked, level of attacker, level of defender, amount of damage
defender has already suffered.

1) Defender's level is considered -1 per 10% damage, so a person
damaged 80% is considered 8 levels lower.

2) Attacker wins, lower level than defender, attacker's factions rise,
defender's factions don't change.

3) Attacker wins, higher level than defender, attacker's factions
fall, defender's factions don't change.

4) Attacker loses, lower level than defender, attacker's factions
fall, defender's factions don't change.

5) Attacker loses, higher level than defender, attacker's factions
fall, defender's factions rise.

Note that in almost all cases the attacker loses faction, the defender
doesn't.  And in one case, the defender gains faction.

In re guards, guards always interfere on behalf of the defender,
except when the defender is KOS to the guards.
