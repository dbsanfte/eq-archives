  The way I see it, they can implement a death penalty "deficit" instead of
level loss without disappointing many people, or drastically changing the
way the game is played at the high end.  Level loss is just stupid and it's
one of those things that should go the way of the hybrid experience penalty
and hell levels.  It doesn't enrich the game, it just creatures one more
little frustration for people.

  However, corpse retrievals are, in the game's current form, rather
integral to gameplay.  Though they can be frustrating, they also are a
challenge you overcome.  Though I'm all for getting rid of pointless
frustrations (boats, level loss, ect.), I'm less for getting rid of
legitimate challenges.
