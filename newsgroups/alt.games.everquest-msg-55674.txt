Nice arrangement, but be warned that most of the higher end platinum and
velium jeweled stuff trivials above 250, which is the hard cap on any
tradeskill (and you can only have one tradeskill over 200)
as shown at

Get that defense up a bit, and don't worry so much about offense and 1hb,
you won't be using them much more anyways.

Not sure how you managed to keep abjuration so low, you need to group more
and thorns the tank regularly, divination, cast camo when you're travelling
or when you sit to med after a fight (solo)

Track will never go higher than that as a druid.  the others are max for
level (except swimming obviously)

Have the wife make gold jasper, or buy forest loops, or hunt in a group in

Gold ruby only makes 2str/4wis rings, not face thing, either finance your
wife up to 250 jewelcraft or buy playermade velium/platinum ruby veil (plat
ruby never trivials)

Savants cap out of unrest or the pegasus feathered headdress off the gm
event

>

Platinum or velium jasper, again, finance the wife or buy better (or gold
ruby, but it's not worth the cost of the ruby really)

Drops off evil eyes, 2ac 3wis 3int, or another ulthork bracer (for ac)

Good choice

> Right Wrist Ulthork Hide Bracer AC6 +1 WIS -1 INT

Not bad

See other ring slot  =P

I need some of those  =P, still wearing the 3ac 3wis Prayer Cloth of Tunare
interim reward from the screaming mace quest that I've had since level 4.

Cured Tizmak Surcoat is a good choice, 15AC 7sv magic,
or for medium races and easier to get a Tizmak tunic, 12AC
or Ulthork Hide tunic 13ac 3Wis -5Cha -35HP 35Mana (yes, it has negative
charisma and HP)
or culturally tailored tunic (imbued)

> Back  Studded Cloak AC5
> I want the everfrost cloak (Icebear?) but haven't seen it for sale.

Cloak of the Icebear, nice item, I usually see them for about 35-50pp (never
sold though, great Vox gear)
though you couldn't quite kill one of the icebear brothers for it yourself,
if you can't find one for sale, try to do the polar bear cloak quest, it's
nearly as good, quest instructions at
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=712


> Waist  Purity Belt AC3 +2 STA +2 STR

Get up to 30 or so and get a crystalline belt out of crystal caverns (they
tend to be rather expensive on the open market)  or get the GM event priest
belt

> Legs  Studded Leggings AC6

Tizmak leggings if you can use them (medium race)  8ac
Eventually Kromrif Military Leggings are nice
or Gatorscale leggings


> Feet   Studded Boots AC5
> Haven't seen any wis leggings or boots for sale.

Save up for Eboots, coldain skin or cultural tailored

Velium etched stone mace, 7/22 3wis 3str, I got one that was rotting for
free (Lore item) so, if you hunt in great divide you might eventually see
one shouted out because a group that cant loot it will down Yaka to try and
get his rare drop gauntlets (he seems to always drop the mace) and until
then, get a velium morning star or warhammer, same stats but magic, or a
crystal shadow star/mace/hammer with its slight stat improvements (not the
fading shadow ones that aren't magic and only have +2 hp on it).

Yup.

Good choice

Nope, but I see a lot of people carrying around turmoil warts or shattering
hammers in it anyways.
