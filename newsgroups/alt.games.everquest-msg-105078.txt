With the group you mention, I predict a massacre. :-)

Not because of a lack of skill or uberdom, but pathing in MM is just
so bad its almost impossible to pull there without eventually getting
a train when something runs the long way around to get you.

While proximity agro goes all the way up to 60, assist (chain) agro
stops cold at level 50 in MM.   That means you could set up in front
of the castle and have your level 52 shaman friend pull mobs out of
the castle to you getting singles every time.  But as soon as somone
below level 50 loses invis inside the castle, you're going have 5 ~ 50
mistmoore mobs wanting to share your keg.


But I could be wrong, so give it a try.  I haven't been there with a
less-than-60 character since pre-kunark days.  We didn't have as good
of choices of armor and weapons back then, so maybe a low 40s group
with kunark/luclin/velious gear could handle Mistmoore Castle trains.

We also carried our dwarven work boots to the dungeons to save on wear
and tear.  And it was uphill, both ways.  And there was always snow.
