Nope, you've proven yourself a blithering idiot. You've also proven yourself
a sad, desperate, lonely individual with your childish ploys of sidestepping
being killfiled by changing your name every time someone announces you've
been KFed. YOu can deny it all you want, all your antics prove is that
you're a pathetic loser with absolutely no life. As long as you keep them
up, you'll never be able fool anyone into thinking otherwise....or that you
don't care what they think. We know the truth, and your pathetic thrashings
only reinforce that knowledge.

Didn't wanna bother having to update the sig on a regular basis because I
level or delete a character...

What, you were expecting some other explaination?
