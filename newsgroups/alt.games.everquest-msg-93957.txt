Not entirely true.  At level 1, each point of wisdom will give you 0.2 mana.
So, a +5 Wis ring will give you 1 mana.  The mana ring would be better.  The
break even point would be level 5.  At level 5, each point of wisdom gives
you 1 mana.  By the time you hit level 60, each point of wisdom gives you 12
mana.  All this assumes wisdom under 200.  At 200 wisdom things change
drastically, each point of wisdom over 200 gives you 5.8 additional mana
regardless of level.  This is all according to the castersrealm mana
calculator.
