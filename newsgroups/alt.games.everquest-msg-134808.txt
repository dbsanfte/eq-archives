Which is the problem. The general mass does not understand the problems.

1)soloing is not really important for any class.
2a)Shamans are at least twice as good at soloing for raw exp
2b)When was the last time you saw a druid solo a dragon or rumblecrush ?
c) clerics suck ass at soloing , they however can do it to lvl 60 with
little trouble. The reason they dont bother is that soloing inherently sucks
and it is easy to get a group as a cleric so there is no real incentive to
learn. (The same aplies for enchanters)
