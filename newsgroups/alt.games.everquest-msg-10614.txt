Oddest thing.  All my friends have talked about this, even when I'm 
grouped.  I've *never* seen any messages of this sort, although I do 
notice the green fog.  I'm a 12th level bard, btw.

What I HAVE noticed, is that for some reason, I have found a sweet spot 
in NK where I can easily solo reds - untwinked and unbuffed (cept for my 
own).

Freaky, if you ask me.
