I guess you're daft also, I was referring to the reply by "tiffanie sims"
which said:
"How about Lake of Ill Omen? Might be better @ 22 . I hunted in NK and EK at
20 for a bit."

IN REPLY to what Celaeno said:
"My SK's necro partner wants to mess around with his undead spells
(we're level 20 now) and suggested going to LOIO, where I refuse to
go... What is the level range of the Rathe Mts. undead?"

That spelled out enough for you?
