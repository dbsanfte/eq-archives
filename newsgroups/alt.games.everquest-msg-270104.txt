You're kidding, right?

I've done the orc quest all of once, over the six characters I've played.

As I already said, it's nowhere near required, and is in my opinion the most
pointless quest in the game.   All you get is a weapon that is immediately
outclassed by the first quest reward that you get upon city arrival.   Skip it
and get on with your life.
