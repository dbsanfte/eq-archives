There are 2 Sphinx's that live in the Valley south of HG Valley Zazamoukh
and
Ankhefenmut  they are both Enchanters and 1 is good the other is evil. They
are for the most part static spwans and only move when Agroed. Zaz is 40ish
and Ank is mid to high 40s. More then likely someone looking for Hasten
agroed one of them since Hastens spwan point is very close.
