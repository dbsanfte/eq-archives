    The worst train I ever pulled, I didn't pull.
    I wanted to test out a new spell.  So I went to Black Burrow, which at
the time, for me, was a safe zone (it is now a "I smite everything in a
single blow" zone).  First step was to find a kind of gnoll that I didn't
kill with a single blow.  Luckily I found this in the Elites.  However the
shot I was putting into the gnoll was such that if I "tapped" an elite with
my stick, and then hit it with this spell, it would die, without letting me
see the secondary effects of the spell (a nice knock-back).
    Now, what I wanted was to pull the little bugger up topside, so I could
root it next to the gaping hole into the water... and then try to knock it
in.
    So I walk up to an elite... and punch it in the nose (1 point of
damage).  I then walk topside with my elite in tow.  No aggro, no train, no
nothing (the commander was super green to me).
    As I'm walking through a patch of gnolls... Some knucklehead barbarian
decides that he's going to save the wizard who was unhurt, and over twice
his level. Knucklehead attacks the elite.  Suddenly every gnoll I had
passed, every gnoll within an elite's rather large mayday range, and a few
that were just close to some of those, charges knucklehead.
    Knucklehead zones with about 10 hp left (and I know that because after
he came back, and was screaming about the train, he insisted on telling us
that he barely escaped).  And there I am with about 45 lowbies, and about 6
million gnolls... only one of which (the elite) that was actually aggroed on
me... all at the entrance.  Folks are desperately trying to run out of the
zone, from every nook and cranny... all bringing their pups, scrawnies, and
(really soon) the commander also to the entrance, to escape this train.
    Folks couldn't get out... there were folks trapped in the mob, couldn't
move.  Man it was a mess.  What was also kind of interesting, was how few
people tried to actually cut their way out... everyone seemed to just run
and panic.  A VERY few actually tried to fight the train.
    Lucky for the 4 brave souls that stayed to fight, I had my best AOE bomb
memmed.  Some of the folks who escaped only managed to do so because that
bomb litterally cut a swathe through the knot in the tunnel out.
    I backed myself into the corner so I was only facing gnolls one way...
and AOE bombbed until there was no mana left... pulled out my stick, and
went to town.  [F8] [A]... >whack< >whack< "Your Target is too far away"
[F8]... >whack< >whack< "Your Target is too far away" [F8]... >whack<
>whack< "Your Target is too far away" [F8]... >whack< >whack<
    When I got up enough mana for a shot, AOE BOOM!
    Constant melee for 25 (RL) minutes.
    Finally I stood on a mountain of bodies with the 4 guys who didn't zone.
All of us within a bubble of a corpse run (myself included... it's amazing
what 6 million greenies can do to a wizard).
    When we finally finished digging through the bodies, we found ONE player
corpse.  (Actually, there were 3, but two of them had been there before).

    So I medded up full mana and health... actually made a point of giving
10 plat each to the 4 guys that stayed and fought (figured I'd probably made
50 plat off the loot, that would be their share).
    Went back down to punch another elite in the nose...

Me:    /ooc There is going to be an elite gnoll chasing a running wizard in
a funny robe.  Do not attack this gnoll, and there will be no train.  It is
an expiriment, and I promise you there will be no train, if you leave him
alone.

Me:    /shout There is going to be an elite gnoll chasing a running wizard
in a funny robe.  Do not attack this gnoll, and there will be no train.  It
is an expiriment, and I promise you there will be no train, if you leave him
alone.

Me:    /tell Kncklehead Attack this one, and I'll root YOU and bring four
more.

(I know I can't root a PC on a non-PVP server... but I don't think he knew
that).
