According to castersrealm it's (group wolf) slightly faster.  But
regardless, it's not something you'll likely notice unless you're /following
someone with a computer the same as yours with a connection the same as
yours.

If a cleric isn't needed in an outside xp group then a druid can fill his
shoes very well.  Of course, so can a shaman, but I think you're just
depressed about your class right now...many friends who play druids have a
definite inferiority complex.  NO ONE beats druids as a general
(non-formula) class, and no one even comes CLOSE when it comes to PLing a
level 1-40 player.

My main is an enchanter and I ALWAYS pray for a druid in my group, because
they're the best at keeping me alive (clerics have the tendency to believe
that no one needs healing until they're at half health).

And, of course, any time you have runners the best class to have there is a
druid...rangers are too busy doing the "I can hit, or I can think...you
pick" thing.  I've heard "oops" from rangers far more often than druids in
that regard.
