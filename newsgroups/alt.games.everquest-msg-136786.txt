Vietnam:

Dispatches (forgot the author but he was a reporter during the war and
writes from real life experiences)
The sorrow of war (ditto, but it's written from the other side, a Viet Cong
officer)
We were soldiers once.. and young (Harold G Moore, Lt Gen I believe)
Nam - Mark Baker

The American War (I think) - Jon Neale
Plus a number of books that were less memorable but gave me all the basic
facts about the war, it's structure, etc etc

Korea:
The Korean War - Max Hastings
Guerilla Dynasty - forgot author
This Kind of War - Ferehenbach

And other 'Korean War' type titles that are unremarkable. It's a bit tough
to state them all because I tend to go for books written by people that were
there rather than statistic type books and only those stand out. I also read
most on loan from the library so I can't remember all the authors off the
top of my head and I can't be bothered to go back to the library just to
write their details down. I highly recommend 'This Kind of War' and 'We were
soldiers once... and young', they will change much of your view of war if
you have macho aspirations.

My other sources are websites, documentaries (books and video/TV), newspaper
articles if I see them, other books..

TBH, most of what I read was from Reuters, BBC and other news websites or
news paper articles in the Guardian, Times or Independent (British
newspapers). A few books worth reading:

Afghanistan - Reuters
Taliban: The story of the Afghan Warlords - A Pakistani journalist that I
don't remember the name of
Inside Al Qae'da - Rohan Gunaratna (got this after a review in the Times and
it's excellent)

Well, I just like facts when it comes to War. I don't suggest they are
propaganda because you recommend them, infact I am likely to read some of
those you suggest, I'm just going from the titles. "Al Queda  - Global
Network of Terror" sounds to me like it will sensationalise the information
in and I don't need that to keep a book interesting.

Far enough, but I wasn't a rguing about the Balkan conflict. I should read
about it but I haven't yet.

All I know is what my friends say and they hate to be called such.
