Biologists define evolution in terms of natural selection. See my other 
reply.

I agree completely. But other processes supplanting natural selection 
exceeds the scope of the theory of evolution, and integrates -additional 
distinct theories.-

Indeed, it would not be inconsisent to supplant natural selection with 
ID theories, if one were so inclined.
