Haven't been playing EQ much...I mean before the login issues, so I
haven't had many EQ dreams.  I was in some odd amalgate of all the
schools I've ever attended plus a library.  I just remember bits of it:
testing an alarm system, some alien who could take on the forms of
humans and therefore killed my friends, and...Monual.

That's right, Monual was in my dream and...he kinda looked like
Urkel...only without the voice.  I was apparently supposed to take him
home from work at the school/library, but at the last second, he
remembered that he *did* drive to work afterall, and wouldn't need me.

This made me think of something: can we all share images of each other
so that if a person *must* invade our dreams, we can at least have an
accurate idea of what they look like?

I'll go first(only because I want to melt your eyes):

the evil-eye.
