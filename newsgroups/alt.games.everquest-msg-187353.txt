What a bass-ackwards way to code it! /cheer Verant

I know for a fact that the 2hb damage calculations are off- I have yet to 
muster the effort to find the new equations, since the differ according to 
level and the delay of the weapon. I also have no idea how the damage 
tables in EQ work, but the modal of a weapon (which is the best measurement 
of its ability to dish out damage) should still be accurate.

Bane weapons and weapons with a + damage (example: Sheetmetal Ulak, poison 
damage 2) are also not accounted for, as I have no idea where that damage 
bonus is applied (though I would assume in the damage bonus spot where your 
primary hand gets a bonus)
