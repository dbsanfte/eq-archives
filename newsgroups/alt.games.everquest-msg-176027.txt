Mirrors
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

( - D. Roeser - B. Abbott - )

A mirror is a negative space
With a frame and a place for your face
It reveals what the rest of us see
It conceals what you'd like it to be

Pretty girls can't look away
Pretty girls can't look away
Pretty girls can't look away
Pretty girls can't look away

Pretty girls have a love afair
With their eyes and their shining hair
Fantasize that the world adores
Tantalize like a cover girl

Mirrors are the basis of beauty
Give rise to self love or self pity
The prize if a woman is pretty
She tries like a superstar Hollywood girl

Pretty girls can't look away
Pretty girls can't look away
Pretty girls can't look away
Pretty girls can't look away

Vanity's a deadly sin
It's what the flesh is packaged in
Vanity's a deadly sin
It's what the flesh is packaged in

A mirror is a negative space
With a frame and a place for your face
It reveals what the rest of us see
It conceals what you'd like it to be

Vanity's a deadly sin
It's what the flesh is packaged in
