If you buy stat-increasing food, it won't work unless it is in the
upper left backback slots (inside the backback is OK).  However, you
will eat that first and then it will be gone!  The way to avoid this
is to keep cheap food and drink down below and continually right-click
on them utnil you're full.  You have to keep "force-feeding" yourself
once in a while, then you won't ever lose you special food!

Also, be sure to force feed before you even buy stat food or you might
eat the stat food immediately by accident!
