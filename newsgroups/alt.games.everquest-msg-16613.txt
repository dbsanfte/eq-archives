The 49+ fire pets are substantially better than the ones before. They are
great for hunting giants. 49 mages can kill 2 hill giants simultaneously
with just the fire elemental, no casting on their part at all.

They are nice if nobody in the group can easily root. But in group
enviornments, fire and air tend to be best...fire for the damage, air for
the stuns.
