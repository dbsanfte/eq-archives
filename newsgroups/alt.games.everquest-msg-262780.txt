Thanks for the offer, I'm on Firiona Vie. I have enough right now, the
limiting factor right now is the cash for the other parts. I don't
have to get blood in massive quantities, since it's insanely expensive
to try and skill up on cultural. I can buy the blood in the bazaar or
come up with some limited quantities by vendor diving, but I wanted to
try and get it myself. I've slaughtered dozens of the creatures at a
time, you'd think that I'd be standing ankle deep in blood, but
apparently it takes a very special goblin to bleed when they die...
