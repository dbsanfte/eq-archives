I'm not even happy with that, mostly because I've become strongly
suspicious of the motives of anyone who would attempt to display them
these days. 

If such displays accepted documents from all religions (and
non-religions), despite how distasteful they might be to some people,
and showed them as prominently as the commandments, I'd be more
agreeable about it.

Good luck.

Quite right. The courtroom is for judging people based on the laws of
the nation/state/county, not for judging them on the laws of a
particular religion.
