Now that my newsguy account got renewed, I can get to my backlog.  =)

The Drinal Flag Rebellion has been a big help for them... all of their
pre-flagged requirements could have been met by anyone who went on all of
the megaraids.

Yeah... I'm making a lot of edumacated guesses as to their current
situation, based on supposition and the fact that their web page hasn't been
updated in six weeks.  They're not a guild who is shy about their
accomplishments... when one of their clerics was the first on the server to
get Hand of Virtue, he MGB'd it in the Nexus.  When they beat Rallos Zek,
their members were going from zone to zone /ooc-ing that RZ was dead by
their hand.  Their complete silence says to me that they've stalled.

But I could be completely wrong, and in fact they could be making minor yet
important progress.  We'll see.  =)

I sure hope so.  =)

In a very interesting twist, the two people I complained so much about (the
ones that kill-stole a triggered VSR, amongst other dubious accomplishments)
have left / been kicked out of the guild.  I don't know if it's a ploy, a
disagreement that will eventually be settled, or a permanent parting of the
ways.  Those two have been in the guild since it came over to Drinal from
Mith Marr; it's amazing to see them sitting without the guild tag next to
their names.  This is again something I'm watching closely.  If those two
stay disconnected from the guild, I'll have almost a positive opinion about
the uberguild.  =)
