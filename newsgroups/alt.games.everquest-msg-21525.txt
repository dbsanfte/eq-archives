 My advice is to not bother really. The effect doesn't last all that
long. It's fairly rare from what I hear. I got one awhile ago in Karnors
but I hear it still drops in Kurns as well.

 Thanks for reminding me about this thing. I still have one I'd like to
get rid of. Anyone know the average price this can fetch?
