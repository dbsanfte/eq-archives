I had the exact same thing happen to me a few months ago. Check what
type of modem you have. If it is a software modem (if the name of the
modem has PCTel, HSP, Winmodem, in it, it probobly is) then I suggest
purchasing a hardware modem. I bought an external modem off of Ebay
for $25, and I haven't had any trouble with link deaths since then.

If you do not want to splurge money on a hardware modem, you can try
to give your modem an Initilization string to disable 56k. This worked
for me for about a year, until the modem took a hit of lightning and
exploded.

  http://www.modemhelp.net/quickref.shtml

That website has a nice table outlining which init strings go with
which modem. Use the ones in the "Disable V.90 and K56Flex" column.

Not sure what operating system you're using, but assuming you're using
Windows 95/98/Me, to get to the location where you type those init
strings in, do the following:

Windows 95/98:
 - Click Start > Settings > Control Panel
 - Double click Modems
 - Click Properties
 - Click the Connection tab
 - Click Advanced
 - In the box labeled Extra Settings, type in your init string and
click OK to everything.

If you already have a hardware modem, make sure you have all the up to
date drivers and firmware for it.
