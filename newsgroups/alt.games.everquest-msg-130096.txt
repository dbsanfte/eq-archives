Well, it's also the one that is most salient to the topic at hand.
Palestinians were claiming ten times the number of casualties that actually
occured.

I still wonder if that's going to backfire on them when some of those
civilians turn out to not be civilians.  Still, if that happens, then Isreal
can justify a harder response.

That question is a moot point.  Of course I wouldn't want it.  Let's say the
police were looking for a known criminal in my area.  Would I want them
rooting around my house?  Hell no.  If they got a warrent, would I prefer if
they were civil about it?  Of course.

Arafat screwed him before the election, even.

Well, this isn't quite the same as the Clinton peace keeping missions.  Our
military isn't nosing into other people's business, they're hunting for
those who attacked -us-.  As far as our nosing into Isreal's business, well,
that's at a HoS level, not at a ground-pounder level.

I don't think he's doing that, otherwise he never would have called for
Isreal to pull out of the Palestine area "now."  There was a point where I
was wondering if he had forgotten who our allies are.

Yep.  I'll give him credit.  Now, the question is, what does he do with the
situation?

Tightened their butt cheeks.  In other words, they know they've got to walk
a straight line, at least for a while.

Well, look at it this way.  Bush has called for both Isreal and Palestine to
stop the violence, just has Clinton had.  Bush has called for an independant
Palestinian state (which I disagree with... Transjordan is the palestine
state, not the west bank).  That's fairly even handed.  Every time Isreal
stops the fighting, Palestine just fights harder.  That, alone, draws a
clear aggressor, and a clear victim, at least as I see it.

I forget who it was that showed that Isreal hasn't gone against U.N.
resolutions, and that Palestine itself is in violation of them.  Of course,
you have probably figured out that I don't really care much about the UN.

It appears you can tell the difference between something being a concurrent
advantage and being the casus belli.  Many can't.

Call me an idealist, but I think Musharraf understands what he has to gain
by playing it straight, and what he has to loose by screwing up.
