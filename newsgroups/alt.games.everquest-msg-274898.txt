There are a couple of possibilities:

1.  Since adventure and crafting vitality are tracked seperately, the person 
could be going to concentrate for a while on crafting while letting their 
adventure vitality recover a bit.

2.  The person could be an alt-aholic (like me) and be switching to another 
character with a full vitality and play that character, and the next, and 
the next, while the vitality of the original character recovers.  (I tend to 
do this a little bit, though honestly I haven't run down my vitality points 
completely yet with any character, and I certainly wouldn't leave a group 
just because vitality hit 0%.)

Neither really seems a valid reason to disband from an active group to me, 
but I can certainly see why someone would want to maximize their experience 
gain if they are either a crafter or an alt-aholic.
