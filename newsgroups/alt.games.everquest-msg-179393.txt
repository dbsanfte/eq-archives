If you want, you can go into the EQ file   UI_charname_64.INI.

Look for XPos800x600 (or whatever resolution you run) and you
will find that some windows have an X position of (in my case)
-62000.  That is WAY left of the screen and that is why the windows
aren't appearing.

Fix it just by changing that value to 200 and you'll be ok.
