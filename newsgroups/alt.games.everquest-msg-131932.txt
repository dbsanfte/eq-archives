If I read this right, I totally and utterly disagree.  Are you really
telling me spamming fast heals on your tanks in big fights is useless?
Next time you fight the AoW, have all druids on nukes/dots, and all clerics
using *only* cheal.

Somehow I doubt it will be the nice easy fight you expect it to be.

Banking on a critical(proc) to save somebody is the first step to failure,
and I see every single guild I know use divine light/NT/chloro as a very
effective heal spell to keep a MA alive for the rotation, critical heal or
no critical heal.

Cheal is all well and good, but its those baby heals which keep the tank
alive to even get the cheal.
