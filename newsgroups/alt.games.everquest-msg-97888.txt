Well, I once headed to CT to grab a ring of my own. I was lvl 40 by that
time and was actively questing things because I was in hell anyway. I met
there a lvl 50 mage who spent roughly 3 days (of 6-8 hours) camping any
alligator she saw and still had no ring. 2 days later I heard she got it.

Face it, if you're a mage, you're screwed in your quests. Go for the boots,
it's the only thing worth questing of your class armor in the old world /
Kunark.
