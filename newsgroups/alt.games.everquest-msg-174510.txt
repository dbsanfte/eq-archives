I haven't lifted a finger to put any terror plans into action, if anything
were to happen it is because God is doing it. Frankly, I think God must have
been very pleased with my actions as I saw the brightest rainbow I've ever
seen yesterday and the Raiders won too. I think God may even be trying to
bless me as a result of my little hijink even though when people try to help
me I always screw it up, I think I probably screwed up yet another
opportunity today by spazzing out.

I'll admit it, I'm a yet another desperately lonely male with no social
skills, social dyslexia, short term emotional memory dysfunction, and
probably schizophenia, maybe autism who the hell knows (basically means that
I can't interpret perceived actions into any emotional value), and if I
could I couldn't remember the emotions. I think I'm going to die soon from a
lack of feeling loved, people have tried to love me before, but I have never
felt it, I've never felt love before and that is very, very painful.

I would have to assume that most people who go on to do harmful things later
in their lives must have a similiar problem.

I wish I just had someone to play computer games with and go to the movies
and do anything else that might be interesting.
