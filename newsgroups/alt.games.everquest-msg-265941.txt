The management system needs some improvement though (and I submitted
feedback on this).  The main thing is that it needs a way to find things by
zone.  At the very least, they need a "find quests for the current zone"
button that will show you all the items in the quest journal that have a
step in in the current zone.  Better would be if it showed the quests that
have an unfinished step in the current zone.

There are also some bugs (which I reported).  The most annoying was on
quests to gather N items.  Sometimes it would not update to report the
acquisition of the last item.  For example, on the citizenship quest, I was
told to go to a specific zone and get 5 tokens off mobs there.  At first, I
was getting messages after each kill that either said I got a token (and my
journal updated) or that said I failed to find a token.  After 4, I stopped
getting those messages, but the journal still said I needed another token.
Eventually, I got killed, and when I respawned, my journal had advanced to
the next step of the quest.  I saw the same thing happen at level 9 when I
was choosing the next refinement of my class.  The trainer told me to go get
5 something-or-others from slimes in the sewers.  After 4, I stopped getting
the message about getting or not getting the quest item.  On a hunch, I
zoned out, and sure enough, I was on the next step of the quest.

But mainly, it is the organizational improvements they need.  50 quests will
get very confusing as it now stands.

I love the idea...but the voice acting is *terrible*.  It sounds to me like
they got a bunch of stage and screen actors who never did any voice acting
before, and who did not know how to bring a character to life without being
seen, and so massively overcompensated by trying to adopt weird voicings.

A lot of it reminded me of whenever in a play or movie or TV show, you have
an actor playing an actor, so they exaggerate things to make it stand out
that they are acting.

I'm afraid that, if I get EQ2, turning off the voices will be the first
setting I change.
