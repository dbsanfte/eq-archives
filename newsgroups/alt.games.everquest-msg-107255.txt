I know this is going to sound stupid and feel free to flame if you want, I
really don't care. I am starting a level 1 pally gnome and am getting him
his soulfire. I really have no desire to play a pally I just think a level 1
gnome with one would look cool (my reasons are my own and I think people
take the game much too seriously). I started the pally last night and got
him to the Freeport pally guild, after finding Merko, I told him "I am a
squire" and he told me I must journey in the ways of valor or something. I
know this is a faction issue as I can start a level 1 human pally and get
the note no problem. I tried multi-questing the note to give to the guy in
EC and he also said journey in the ways of valor, so that didnt work. I need
to know if the easiest way to raise faction with north freeport guards (I'm
indiff now and from I have read I need warmly to do soulfire). I turned in
muffins to a fat dorf in wfp for faction with druid epic guy in BW. Is there
a way to do some sort of same boring quest for faction with nfp? I also
group with my 54 druid so I get no XP for killing things with the pally.
TIA
