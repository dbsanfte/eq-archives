Aye - as painful as it is for me to admit...

Hmmm. There was one situation where I did loot two items from a corpse
without bothering to check if I could actually use the items first. But I
had a damned good excuse.

I (20 druid), only semi-twinked (still wearing just some plain leather
armor) started kiting a ghoul. All goes well, got the ghoul down to where
I know he's about to turn, stop, and do the "snare stare" when suddenly
ghoul number two starts beating on me. (I had kited into agro range - damn
laggy gah) Since ghoul number 1 was -oh- so close to dead and I had a dot
on him, I managed to pop a snare on ghoul #2 and started kiting both. I
figured when the first ghoul dropped I could loot, then zip for the zone
line. Sure enough, at that moment, an Undead Wraith decides to join the
fun. They double attack in the 90s. I was 95+% HP when he opened up on
me. I start running in big circles kiting all three.

NO! Oh no! Ghoul 1 down to a sliver of life and the dot wears off - gonna
have to actually stop and cast a bolt to finish him but I -can't- because
this wraith is going to rip me a new one the second I stop running.

I decide the loot isn't worth the 4 yellow bubs of exp I've earned in this
zone already, I head for the bridge and shout the train warning. All this
time ghoul #1 is targeted suddenly I see..

You have gained experience!

w00t! Someone couldn't wait for me to zone to KS the obviously almost dead
mob and had dropped the ghoul, since snare hadn't worn off yet - it was
just standing there waiting to die. I do a wide circle and come back and
manage to find where he had dropped. I rush up to loot...

w00t! TWO count them TWO no drops. I start to inspect the first item.

An undead wraith hits YOU for 98 points of damage!
An undead wraith hits YOU for 86 points of damage!
An undead wraith begins casting a spell
You feel your life force drain away. You have taken 36 points of non-melee
damage.

Time to run. I loot both no drops and zone. One was a bard item, the other
a rogue cloak. It was my kill, it was mine to loot. I would have left them
had I the time to determine if I could use them or not, but I wasn't given
the choice.

And all of that was very fun ;-)
