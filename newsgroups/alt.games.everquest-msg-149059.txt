Wahh wahh I'm insensitive. I guess I'll go take a class taught by some
hippy on anger management and sit by humming a calm little tune while
the world burns around me. Anyone has the right to do anything and you
have the right to sit by and judge like an idiot if you want to. And
as for comparing to hitler if you censor, give this or that choices,
or just tell people to do things you are worse than Hitler ever was.
Don't fuck with anyone's rights to free speech or choice dipshit. And
if you let little stupid emotions get in the way that easily you might
as well use that razorblade beside your comp right now cus you're not
gonna go far in life anyway.
