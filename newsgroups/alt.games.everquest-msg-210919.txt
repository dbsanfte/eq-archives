So I want to get my mage focus items sometime, started looking
into it.  All the parts are trivial to get ahold of except the
shovel, broom, stein and.. whatever that other thing is.  Drop
off magicians in Najena... well I can't get in there to kill yet,
since its hard for me to handle more than one mob at a time with
no CC spells whatsoever; I'd need a group, or at least a buddy,
and my buddy is at the moment only level 9 (see the how to PL
with a mage thread)

But the alternative seems to be "an alligator" in feerot.  Sounds
much more doable... except that I can't find any notes on how to
find this mob.  Its a big zone with poor visibility and lots of
mobs wandering around; if there's a PH for it that wanders
everywhere I could just try and kill that sort of mob, but I
suspect its something that shows up only in one area of the zone.

Of course if its an "always up" sort of mob I can log on my bard
on the MT server and use track to find it... but if there's a PH
arrangement, I'd need to know what sort of mob I was looking for.

Amazingly, the focus items I've seen in the bazaar (they aren't
no drop on FV) are going for over a thousand pp... which strikes
me as odd on a server where you can't twink yourself because you
can only have one character.  Where are these low level mages who
can't solo the quest getting thousands of pp to buy the items
with?  Sadly I have yet to see the shovel/broom etc available in
the bazaar at any price.
