Correct me if I am wrong, but drowsy is a 15% slow, but costs as much as
several heals. If you are lucky, and manage to successfully cast it
before the mob is nearly dead, it will lead to one mob doing about 10%
less damage.

I can't see it being worth it to cast that at level 12. And without the
mana drain for that, you will be able to melee and keep up the same mana
level.

And at level 12, with a cheap twink weapon, you can likely do the same
damage as a monk using fists, leading to mobs dieing 50% faster and
hence doing half the damage.

Even if you only do half the monks damage through melee, that is still a
bigger damage reduction than drowsy, leading to more mana saved for
healing.

Things change at higher levels, or in a larger group.
