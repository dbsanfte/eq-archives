Yes, and there is some downtime there. But also, you can't tell what is
scheduled and what is "unscheduled" (ie crash). As far as CS goes I give
Mythic an 8 - they're usually pretty good at announcements but sometimes
they've snuck things in when you're not looking. FWIW I give SOE a 7 -
they're about the same as Mythic as far as that goes but they fall a bit
short on listening to their customers (not withstanding the "revolt" a
while back). From what I hear I'd most likely give NCSoft a 9 - most things
I've read implied they were forthcoming and honest with the players.

"I believe everyody in the world should have guns. Citizens should have
bazookas and rocket launchers too. I believe that all citizens should have
their weapons of choice. However, I also believe that only I should have
the ammunition. Because frankly, I wouldn't trust the rest of the goobers
with anything more dangerous than string."
