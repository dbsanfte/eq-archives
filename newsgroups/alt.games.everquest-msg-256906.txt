You know, I am not entirely certain about both captains taking either type.

Just because I was curious about the rewards of this one; my little
Beastlord collected about 40 scalps in Crushbone and 'ran' over to the Orc
side captain and turned them in.  He accepted them (Orc scalps), and the
coin was minimal and the exp almost nothing, but what the heck, it was
something at 10.

I seem to recall, along time ago when the PGT was a desired weapon, that
they took both, but as I said that was a long time ago...

I wish I could be more definitive sorry.
