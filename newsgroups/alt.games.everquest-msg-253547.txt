Ahhh... Ok, I was being dense. :)  So after a canni, there is probably a 
percentage you could be at where this is relevant... Where you have 
almost-but-not-quite enough mana for the heal, and it lets you cast and 
then after the timer counts down says, "nope! screw you! no mana!" And 
then you're at a lower percentage than before you cast...  It may be some 
kind of server sync issue.  I dunno.

Boy, I wish I could canni.  Or would remember to use that mod rod that's 
always sitting in my luggage... :)
