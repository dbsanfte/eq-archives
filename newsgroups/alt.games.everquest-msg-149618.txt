Many rogues also still use their epics, until they start getting the SzTemp
upgrades or NToV/ST upgrades from Velious.  Even if it's not main-handed,
40% haste PLUS a direct ATK bonus is hard to forgo.   A 13/20 main-hander
with 22% haste isn't as good as a 15/25 with 40%, even if it IS better if
you
have another 40% haste item in another slot.  Although even then, without
some Vengence IX item or something, it still not be worth it to lose the ATK
bonus.

Now if RB would just get a Range-slot tag...
