Your income is only as big or small as the effort you put in.
You need to find out what the 'hot' items are and how/where to get them.
With that knowledge the marketplace can become your playground.

You'll find that the ingame market is secondary to the forum market where
most everything is bought and sold. They are on the main AO forums, look for
them and find out what is in demand.

Some advise on making money, if you don't want to play (buy low and sell
high) the market, is after you do a team mission, get another team mission
before the group breaks up to solo. Boss loot is much more valuable than
most other drops, so if you can get it all yourself, you can earn 100-500k
per mission (500k with a little luck in the boss' drops) right now.
When I was still playing notum (chips and fragments), stat increasing
armour, actually stat increasing anything, NCU, NCU belts and drop only
nanos/disks were hot items.
Find out whats hot now and keep your eye out for it when running missions,
so you don't sell it to a vendor as junk.
