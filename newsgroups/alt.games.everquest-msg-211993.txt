Uhh, 2 minutes per mob kill?  What?

A "good" exp grind group should be able to completely clear lightning
side of BoT and "steal" mobs from wind side.  Similarly the same group
should be easily able to keep all of lower sands cleared and steal
some of the middle sands group (although, that isn't recommended--wind
is rarely if ever camped so go for it).

Two "good" groups should be able to keep almost all of the pits in
tatics cleared.  Anything else isn't a "fast exp group".
