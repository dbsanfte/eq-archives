God, you've got so many possibilities.

It should be noted that on the Old World all of these USED to be
semi-popular but I rarely see more than a few people there anymore.  I won't
mention the ones that I remember you mentioning:

Antonica 12-22 or so:
Lavastorm for a few levels
Najena for a few more
NK until around 20
EK for a few more levels
WK bandits at some point (don't know their level).
South Ro to about 18, maybe 20

Faydwer:
Steamfont for a COUPLE levels.

Odus:
Warrens

Antonica 22-30+
Najena still a possibility though I don't care for the zone
Solusek's Eye (SolA)
Karanas are pretty much out (road less traveled, anyway)....
Permafrost

Faydwer:
Unrest on the off-times, though I'd probably just avoid the continent in
your particular case.

Odus:
Stonebrunt - people just don't seem to be going there.  Too out-of-the-way.
Being a necro you may not be KOS in Paineel so it'll be convenient.  After a
level or two in Warrens you almost certainly won't be KOS.
