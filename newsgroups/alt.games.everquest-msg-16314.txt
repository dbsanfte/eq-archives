Clerics get fear though.  I've been the fear machine in -tons- of
fear kites.  I can root and atone adds, keep the mob feared,
clean up any minor damage that may result from the mob turning
(and if you are higher level and fighting reds, there -will- be
some trouble when it breaks)  Further, I'm a plate class, self
buffed up to near warrior levels in terms of ability to suck up
some damage.  Like waving a red flag before a bull, I'll add that
since Bergh was -created- with the fear kite in mind, I actually
have done more melee damage in a fight than many a pickup
paladin. High Strength and a solid 2hb weapon, plus well
developed skill at non-auto combat and following (so I swing
only when the target is actually in range)

Bard track sucks compared to ranger, and a druid lies at best somewhere
in between. On the other hand, there is -much- to reccomend the bard.
Another cleric?  I can't think of any reason to put that on the list.  One,
yes, two, no.

Aye, warriors are not good at offense, comparatively speaking.

These factors are level based to some extent, but over a certain level
I'll agree.

Bergh
