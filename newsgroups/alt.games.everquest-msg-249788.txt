Assuming we'll never get to see the results of the poll, Allakhazam's also
put a poll up on this subject. The last I checked it was:

32% - no
28% - I will quit if they make it legitimate
25% - yes
5% - I will play forever if you make it legit
10% - don't care

So that's 60% that don't want it, including almost a third of the gaming
population that would quit outright, and 30% that is OK with it.  

Evidently those of us who don't want it aren't that rare.
