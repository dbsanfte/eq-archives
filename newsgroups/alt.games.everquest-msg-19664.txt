Strange, I've never seen nor heard of it.

My shaman, for whatever reason, seems to be immune to dragon fear. The only
dragon that has ever successfully feared me is the spawned version of
Faydedar. I've gone on 18-20 raids against naggy/vox/kunark dragons, and
even with really pathetic MR, I have never been feared.

That and the gating :)

If you are killing phara dar, then you don't need much advice on resist
gear :)

I mean any one individual dragon only requires a single resist. The raids I
have been there, magic resist seemed to be entirely pointless. Fire/Cold
are the big ones, but there are enough poison/disease users to pay
attention to.

>Which WW dragon are you referring to?

He is one of the ToV "guard line" dragons...facing into ToV, he is on the
right side, the second one over (I think, it has been a while) from
sontalak. Definately has 2 different AEs...one is straight damage, the
other is a DoT.
