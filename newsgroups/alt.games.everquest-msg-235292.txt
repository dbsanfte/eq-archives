I have always read that the amount of experience to get AA is constant at
all levels.  The testing was done by people who used ShowEQ back when ShowEQ
would show you the numerical experience value of each mob in the zone.  They
then used the fact that the experience required to earn one AAXP point is
static to calculate the XP modifier of the various zones.
