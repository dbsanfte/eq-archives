once not to long ago a level 56 cleric was asking how to get to the arena.
(how a level 56 didnt know this is beyond me)
anyways i was going off to paw so i told him i would show him. i took him to
the arena for a cleric BOtB and he said thanks i will give you a free rez
whenever you need whereever i am. i think to myself yah right whatever. say
goodbye and am on my merry way. well few days later i ding 30 and am almost
done the first of the hell levels. when i die 2 times. once trying to help a
newbie once trying to get my own body back. i want to see if he will follow
through on his offer not really expecting him to since he is Tower of frozen
shadows. but he says sure can you come get me (port) im said sorry cant do
it not high enough level to port there yet. he says ok. he will get a port
and meet me in WK soon. he comes rezes me and i offer him 100pp he cancels
it and goes back to Iceclad spires with his wizard friend. now THAT is
repaying a favor.
