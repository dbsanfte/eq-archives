That is true I'm afraid, however I can recommend an excellent place to take
a healer-type partner: Dulak's. My 52 beastlord has made almost 2,000 plat
in less than a level clearing the first 2 or 3 boats there (all db or lb to
me). The mobs drop a few plat each, and weapons that sell for 1 to 3 plat
each, but the real payoff is the gems they drop: those sell for anywhere
from 55 to 220 (!) plat apiece. Blue diamonds are the 220 ones. There are
vendors and a bank at the Gunthak lighthouse.

There is some competition for the boat camps but its not as bad as Rathe in
that regard. And be advised that the boats at the docks get harder in order
one through five -- you and a partner will have a hard time with the 4th one
and the 5th one really won't be safe for you. The mobs don't get tougher,
but they get more numerous so by the 4th boat you really can't single-pull
at all.
