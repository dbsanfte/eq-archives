Lol, i know a bard with a DE mask...=)

But really all it takes is a person new to the zone running straight 
from the FV tunnel to the ruins by KC / ridge for a group. The path 
takes you fairly close to the ruins he lurks in, and if you aggro him, 
he will follow. You have to be on good iksar monk faction for him to not 
agro you. Though also new people to the zone will try to kill just about 
anything that moves, and get him out roaming around. any number f 
reasons for him to be about. I do remember a tank screaming ooc about 
accidently pulling him that got him laughed at in zone once we all 
emerged from KC or other zonelines.

IIRC in the 10 or so levels I hung out in DL leveling or socializing 
with people there grouping and doing temperences/rezzes at least every 
third day veltar would wander around. It was fairly common for him to be 
out and about on a saturday.
