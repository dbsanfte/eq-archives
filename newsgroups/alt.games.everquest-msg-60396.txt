Some basic things here... Try to heal up AFTER and BEFORE combat as much as
possible. If the MOB is dead, it can't aggro on you :).

If you do not have an enchanter or other class that can mez in the group
with you, make sure all mobs have sufficient aggro on the tanks before
healing. That means DISREGARDING the common approach of having all tanks on
one mob. Thats a great tactic to kill one mob quickly, and is preferred when
it can work, but is a bad idea if it means your cleric will die.

Lastly I want to make note here, this problem gets much better at higher
levels. I've seen clerics throw a Complete Heal for over 1k of healing and
not draw aggro on a mob that was JUST pulled. At lower levels this is a big
concern. Just work up that AC and defense and make a macro telling your
group they have to get this %t off you RIGHT NOW or you won't be able to
heal.
