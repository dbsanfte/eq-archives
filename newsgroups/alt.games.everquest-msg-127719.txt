Only works on mobs with pockets.

Any humanoid that normally drops coin can be
pickpocketed.  This does not include undead,
but does (weirdly) include giant monkeys and
chickens.

But even if they drop loot, you can't pick bugs
and their related floppy larval friends.  Practice
humanoid mobs (at level 9, heck, practice on the
guards that you're bound next to...no corpse
run or exp loss ;-)  ).  Your skill WILL go up,
slowly but surely.

No.
