90 - water pets properly positioned on a PoP mob break 90 regularly.
They do it for far longer than 2minutes too.

My original post concerned pre-PoP xp groups, PoP xp groups, and LDoN
groups - which pretty much means that the burst damage from TS is NOT
the average DPS you'll be looking at for the session.

The statement was made that pets only do 1/3rd of a melee's damage - 
patently false, as very few, if any, melee can sustain 270dps, but a 
water pet can.
