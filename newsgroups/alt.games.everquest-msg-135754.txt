At first, I was impressed to see you in this thread - you have a good
communication skill.  But no offence, your logic system is very flawed,
and doesn't quite fit with your level of communication.

Stop here!.  tall/thin/curley/braces are ALL "attributes" NOT behaviors.

> liking chocolate, hating to dance, etc. 

Are "behaviors"!  i.e. if your brain wasn't working, you wouldn't
have these "behaviours", whereas if you were in a coma, you would
STILL have an attribute of tall/thin/curley/braces, RIGHT ??

In which case you need your brain to accomplish. If you were DEAD,
you'd still be thin/tall/curley/braces, right ??  If you were DEAD,
would you still be "gay" ??  Think about it.

...much like pulling your hand on "instinct", would be a gay person
in a sexual setting, no ?  You are not being consistant here.  Gay
is a "behavior", NOT an attribute.  You did a nice job explaining
"behaviours" in the paragraph above here, but its noteworthy how
you were able to cite "two" kinds of behaviours (which is good),
concious, and instinct, but yet omit "gay" which also happens to
be argued by two other schools of thoughts (or behavior), thoes
who thing its "born with", vs. "learned" (the "concious" & "instinct").

We're NOT debating whether or not "behaviours" are correct or not,
we're arguing the DIFFERENCE between *behaviours* and *attributes*.

GeezeSUS! - stabilize thy thought process framework will ya!  You're all
over the map with mixing up behaviour/attributes, now "actions".  Too
bad you're not a coder - it be easier to explain it with a Java stub.

True. (that statement alone, that is)

"different" = varying "behaviour" OR "attributes" OR "actions" !!!

Yet a FORTH variable you introduce into your loose knit definitions.
Said DIFFERENCES can be applies to BEHAVIOUR, ATTRIBUTES, ACTIONS etc.,
as well as the "differences" themselves !  Can you lock all that down ??

Then Joe is "smart", and therefore affords standard acceptance/respect
by, and "of" thoes in the standard bell curve.

That has no value.  I'd like to know that the reason Joe hasn't told
anyone (in his school yard setting) is because it doesn't FIT in such
setting !!!!!  Further, sounds like ole Joe has the smarts to know about
how society is, and social norms, and bell curves (and Darwin) etc.

The point being is, you want to not only IGNORE the laws of nature,
but because said gay person doesn't fit under the giant bell jar
overtop the humans known as the bell curve, you want to just pick
up the jar and move it over Joes way and set it back down and say:
THERE! - Joe is NOW under the social norm bell curve.  Won't happen.

And speaking of ole man Darwin, gays can't reproduce, and thus
don't fundamentally "fit" into the whole evolution thing anyways...
Not being insensitive here, just pointing out that it's an "aboration"
not a norm. (if that even matters here).  But in closing, so think
about the difference between behaviour and attribute.  And to address
an eariler statement you made (in another post maybe), you said being
gay DEFINES someone, or defines their personality or some such shit....
So, to that, if a gay guy gets his nuts blown off in a war, guess what?
according to you, hes got no more personaility.
