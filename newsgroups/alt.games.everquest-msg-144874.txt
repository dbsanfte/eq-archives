That's funny.  And here I thought that Lutherans were mainstream.
Apparently not tho, as we speak of "the priesthood we all share
in Christ" (as I don't keep a Bible at the office I am unable to
verify that that quotes Paul, but I think he's the source).

Not all Christians are Catholic.  Any many, Catholic and non-Catholic
alike, find the liberalism of Jesus (who advised the rich man who
asked to give all he had to the poor) to be far more important than
the conservatism of any number of "church fathers".
