Kaev has an Idol of the Thorned in range slot (it really sucks having
a 75 base STA on a tank class character), show me a bow with more STA
than the Idol and I'll equip it.  Besides, there're a lot of situations
where I can pull easily with a spell but cannot pull with a bow (and
Cease is a whopping 15 mana).
