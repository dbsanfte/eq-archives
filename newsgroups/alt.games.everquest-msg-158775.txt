I wanted a tradeskill but I didn't have a lot of money to dump into it so I
picked baking.  I was able to get my baking skill up to 185 in just two
nights and for under 100pp. I hung on to the Patty Melts I made and
distributed them among my alts instead of selling them back. If I had sold
them all back I would have reduced my expense to around 50pp.  Not the most
exciting skill, but it has to be the easiest and cheapest and you can make
some money at it, although you won't get rich.  The Misty Thicket Picnic is
225 skill (I think) and sell for about 50pp ea in the bazaar because they
have stat buffs.  There are some other food items that have stat buffs so
they might sell as well.  The Patty Melts (as well as some of the other
foods) are lightweight and last longer that regular rations.  They are great
for monks or classes with low strength.
