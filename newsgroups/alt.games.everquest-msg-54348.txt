I don't think I understand the spell "Mend Bones". I tried casting it on
my pet after a particularly vicious fight last night (several adds) for
the first time. I got a message of "Kaobob begins to heal". His health
bar went up a bit, and stopped, apparently. I cast it again, got the
same message, but his health bar didn't move at all. Is this a heal over
time thing like celestial heal? Or is there a limit on how much you can
heal him in one period of time or something?
