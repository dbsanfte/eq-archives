Well after a few months of playing the game i finally decided to quit 
and deleted my chars and closed my account
After spending 11 hours trying every tactic under the sun to make the 
ancient cyclops spawn and failing ive finally realised how shit the game 
is.
Soe idea of game balancing seeems to be "Oh that item/mob has become too 
popular lets increase the spawn time to once a decade"
Well Soe, we dont all have 10 hours a day to spend sitting around with 
fuck all happening.
The problem could be addressed in a better way by making the mob harder, 
or maybe even relocate it.
They should change the ancient cyclops so that it is a regular spawn but 
requires a raid level group to kill it, they can tweak the drop rate of 
the ring everyone wants from it too.
But ive tried all the strategy i found off the web for getting this 
fucker to spawn such as killing undead on desert and in tower and none 
of them work.
Does anyone else have any thoughts on the way Soe makes you spend half 
your life gaining 1 objective for very little reward?
