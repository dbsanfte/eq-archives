I guess that the UK is somewhere stuck between the US and main land
Europe. From my experience pit shaving is quite common, while downstairs
it is more normal for a short back a sides trim rather than the
impressive sculpting of our US cousins or the amature topary of our Euro
neighbours.

The merkin story seems to come up about every 6-8 months in the UK
either in a glossy lads mag (not porn, but close) or a tabloid paper.
The story is normally an unheard of designer / art student / film
director thinks that merkins are cool, especially if they are died
bright colours and look like strawberrys / the union jack / a ganja
leaf. The text of the sory is limited to about that and is followed by
some bizzar shots of "nakid" hips with what looks like a '70s plush
carpet in neon colours draped over anything that could be embarising.

I guess that that is what you get for slow news days.

You should be able to find the stock pictures somewhere on the web now
iif only I could remember the name of the mag, it was Loaded or FHM or
one of those.
