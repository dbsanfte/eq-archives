I have questions on some of the things mentioned in the latest patch....

- Endurance bar was added as a limited resource to power melee abilities and
disciplines.
The first I heard of this was last night when a group member asked if I had
done the PoK quest to enhance my endurance.
Is there a good site to read all about it? (both the endurance bar and the
quest)

- Warriors received the Incite line of abilities, giving them a new tool for
aggro management.

An incite line of abilities?  where was this mentioned?

- Monks received the Phantom Call line of abilities, giving them a new tool
for pulling.

same for the Phantom Call line of abilities?
