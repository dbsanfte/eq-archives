Well, not so far.  I think for three major reasons:  1) We ourselves find
out what to expect from these events from websites;  2) I don't give out
every little detail of what we do (mostly because I'm ignorant of said
details);  3) Being given a strat and executing said strat are entirely two
different things.

Only once, with Rallos Zek the Warlord, did we try to use other people's
strats.  That simply didn't work.  Eventually we learned how to do the event
our way, playing to our unique strengths, and did much better and won.

So people are free to use our strategies, but they will almost surely fail
if they do so.  You can't just follow a script, you have to know and
execute.  A subtle but very important distinction.
