It's about time! One of my playing partners (and one of my longest running
MMOG friends) has been agonizing over whether to quit playing his 46 Warrior
and re-roll or keep slogging it out in hopes that some loving would be
coming his way. This is very timely and will be very welcome.

Also, what does this do the big Warrior stand-down. Wasn't that coming soon?
Coincidence?
