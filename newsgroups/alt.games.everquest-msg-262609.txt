Three thousand Americans paid with their lives for that particular fuck-
up; how many will pay for this one? Bush is like a man who's been stung 
by a wasp, so then proceeds to tromp around the whole neighbourhood 
shouting obscenities and kicking every wasp nest he sees.

I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised to see a degree of 
measure and forethought after 9/11 in how the US administration 
approached the invasion of Afghanistan; unfortunately, it appears that 
since then the smell of oil has driven them out of their minds.
