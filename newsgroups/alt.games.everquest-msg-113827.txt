At 35 to 39, my ranger wife and I hunted in Stonebrunt.  We quested four
(or was it five) Wakazashis of the Frozen Skies.   Each worth about 300pp.
We also got lucky and and our first two attempts to get the swiftclaw sash
(25% haste I think) were successful.  Some decent loot drops off of the Mature
and Elder pandas too.  If you are a tailor or know a tailor, this is a great place
because all of the cat pelts that drop are either low, medium, or high quality.
Sometimes they drop 2 or 3.

You could swarm kite or fear kite there, and there's a great safe place to pull
to - it's a tunnel entrance to a yet-to-be-introduced zone.  It's about 2/3rds of the
way north on the east boundary of the zone.

Bring a friend because you'll often be the only person in the zone otherwise.

By the way, Stonebrunt has an 18% xp bonus, kind of like a dungeon except
it is an outdoor zone.
