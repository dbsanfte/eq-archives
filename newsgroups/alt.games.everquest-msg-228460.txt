Well, wait a second.  It would certain suck if you tried to play it like EQ,
but suppose you adapt your play style.

1. Avoid leveling too high, because someday, you WILL get knocked back to 1.

2. Since you don't want to level, there is no point in killing mobs, other
than for loot.  So, your focus becomes PvP.

It could basically become EQ-Quake, with no one bothering to get above level
4 or so.  If anyone does level up past that, people might single them out as
a challenge to take down, so people that get to some stratospheric level,
like 8 or so (!), might find themselves jumped by a bunch of 4's.

And if people avoid higher levels, there are no Druid or Wizard ports, and
no fast run speed other than low level Selos.  The areas around the PoK
books, and PoK itself, could become interesting battle grounds.

The travel difficulties, and most people staying low level, might keep the
different teams separate enough that it might end up working kind of the way
the realms work in DAoC--you'd be relatively safe in the newbie areas to
level up to 3 or so, and then could go fight around the books (corresponding
to the frontier).

It could be quite an interesting server, actually.  I wouldn't dismiss it
until we see how it plays out.
