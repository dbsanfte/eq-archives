    SOE designs content for whoever there's the most of, and whoever is most
vocal. Soloists aren't part of either group, and do get dumped on, but
there's a TON of content for groups, small raid guilds, and large raid
guilds. If anything, right now it looks like there's a lack of top-end
content (LDoN raids being solved, Time being in rotation on many servers,
new encounters like Bristlebane being very poor Effort vs. Reward).

    We've had more people re-activate dead accounts than ever before, all
because of LDoN. These people don't even attempt to raid any more - they
just do LDoN adventures and chat. That, to me, sounds very casual and not
"newbie". And, in a way SOE has helped top-end soloists - they created three
incredibly farmable dungeons filled with mid-end (2-15 K) loot! :-/
