Everyone will tell you to go to Lake of Ill Omen. However, my suggestion
is to go to the new zone, Stonebrunt Mountains, and get in a group
somewhere like the burly gnoll camp. Sneak/hide your way into Paineel,
get a bind outside the Warrens, and sneak/hide your way through the
Warrens to Stonebrunt.

Alternatively, SK/EK/LoIO
