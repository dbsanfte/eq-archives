Well, it certainly helps to have a level 60 bard draining her, but if you get 
your resists buffed way the hell up, fire up the long-lasting selos with your 
drum, and hit her with Occlusion of Sound.  You don't want to do any damage, 
otherwise you can get summoned.  Just OOS her and run her around.  She'll be 
casting on you, and will eventually run OOM.  You should resist the vast 
majority of her spells, and if you get hit a few times, hit her with OOS 3 or 4 
times in a row, run by the cleric, and get a celestial heal dropped on you.
