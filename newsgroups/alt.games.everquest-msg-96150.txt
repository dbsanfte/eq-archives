I hate that as well. The main reason is that constant bobbing up
and down makes me motion sick. Same reason I hate being in
wolf form and attacking.

I wish their was a way to turn just the bobbing off. What really pisses
me off is the even if I switch to a 3rd person view it STILL bobs up
and down!!!! WTF?

I think they do it because its the only buff Necros can cast on others.
I get it cast on me when I buff others with SoW or Clarity. I think they
figure they have to try and at least reciprocate.
