Bash has no influence on your regular melee.

>Also, if you are trying to cast, doesn't that take away from attempts to
>attack with primary weapon?

Casting stops melee attacks during the cast time.

>Is there a way to do an "auto-bash" type of control?

You could, I suppose, make a macro with /pause and /doability to hit one
button and bash several times as the skill timer recycles...but this would
also lock you into those commands for a fairly substantial amount of time,
and that is not a good thing.

>Is Dodge a passive skill in melee or does one have to actively hit a button
>to attempt it?

Dodge (as well as parry, block, and riposte) are all passive. Put one point
into the skill at the guild, and ignore it from then on.
