We did it with three, sort of by surprise.

Just the druid and I came in to the zone to start killing scouts to start the
cycle.  We'd arranged a necro who was soloing in SF, easy to go
pick up, and planned to add more to our little potential party as the
day wore on.  A paladin friend came on who was willing to actually
come join use for the scouts, but would only be on for an hour or so.
Well, we hopped to WC to get him, and returned... tainted on track.
That single kill of a scout had spawned it for us!

Sent the druid off to pick up the necro, while I buffed the paladin to
the gills.  Did the same for the druid and necro and his pet when
they returned, then the druid ran off to pull the tainted up to the zone to
Steamfont.  During her long and somewhat perilous pull (Tainted packs
a pretty good DD and DOT combo apparantly, and it took her a while
to determine a range where it would follow and yet not cast on her)
the paladin went LD!

Well, we reasoned, we would go ahead and beat the tainted down
close to death and wait, as that was the plan anyway, get back to full
mana for corrupted.  Tainted was easily fear kited, which was a problem;
early on the druid slapped on a DOT to help wear it down... and despite
pulling the pet off towards the end, the little fellow went RIP (running
in place) and then died.

Turns out this was a stroke of luck, with nothing nearby, the corrupted
spawned and just stood there.  We med back to full...  and then it started
casting buffs on itself.  Well, we decided we'd better go for it and hope the
pally would get back or else that we could live to zone if we were overpowered.

Sent in pet, then simultaneously the druid snared, necro feared, and I stunned.

to our amazement, everything stuck.  Dumping all the DOTs and DD they
had down its throat, along with that pet slamming away, and me chain casting
nothing but continuous stuns, the corrupted was dead in under three minutes,
having never cast a spell in anger successfully... while fear broke a couple
times,
and stun missed about 25% of the time, the two never coincided long enough
for it to get a cast completed.

Paladin finally popped back up a few minutes later, having missed the entire
fight, and so losing out on bragging rights over my guildleader, who had sworn
it took two full groups in their 50s to take the corrupted.  I'm certain that
just the druid, paladin, and I could also have pulled it off, in retrospect,
pally
serving as the necro pet and backup stunner when I had to switch to fear.
