For along time (I think from the release of Kunark until Luclin came
out), this cloak was limited to the "small" races (halflings, gnomes,
dwarves, and the small-medium high/dark/wood-elves) + Iksar.  This
made some sort of sense.  It was for small races, and they added Iksar
because it was a Kunark item and it was nice to have Kunark-drops that
Iksar could wear.  In fact based on this item I had assumed that Iksar
were a small/medium type race (like elves).

Around the time Luclin came out, they changed the races on the item to
add in Vah Shir (a large race).  I am guessing there was some general
design decision that went something like "if an iksar can wear an
item, then so can a Vah Shir, since they are they same basic size".
For some reason they also added barbarian, troll and ogre to it at the
same time.  I'm guessing there is a switch in the database to add all
"large" races to an item, and they just hit that.  At this time it
also became apparent that Iksar are considered a "large" race (news to
me up until then, but maybe that's just me).

So, basically now we have an item that is wearable by the small races,
the small/medium races (elves), and the large races.  But it's NOT
wearable by any of the pure-medium races (human, half-elf, erudite).

It really doesn't make any sense at all anymore, I'd have to agree.
It did used to make some sense, but not any more.  I really think this
is best described as a bugged item at this point, but I doubt anybody
cares enough to fix it.
