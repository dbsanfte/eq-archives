i asked this is serverwide.paladins

now, being a 60pally, they came up with either shammy or if i could hold my
own heals, which most of the time i can, (except planar mobs) a chanter.

i ended up choosing a shammy, and i have had soooooooo much fun jus PLin
this guy as much as i can with my 40druid, once the shammy hits 40, its time
to hit him up with my pally and kick some serious karnor's butt, thats gotta
be good exp at 40 duo'ing, lol.

jus thought i'd add my ordeal into the matter, valid i think, but not sure
;)
