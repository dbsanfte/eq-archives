> Its supposed to be realtime this is my next kill too :0(

I think it is - I was on a raid last week when the guy from one of the
Seventh Hammer's uber guilds made an ass of the spawn. I don't want to
name any names *.  (I think the tank started wailing on the Spirit of
Venril Sathir instead of the ranger turning in the Resurrection
spell).  The spawn was screwed up.  However, the next day VSR was back
on track, and myself and another ranger (from a different guild to
mine) put together a joint raid on VSR and we got a stone each.  Guess
who the only fatality was?  Me...hehe but a quick rezz later I looted
my stone.

Thanks to all my Steel Thunder guildies and our raiding partners,
Phoenix Ascendants for the help.

Tzen, 55 Outrider, The Seventh Hammer.
