In that case, use news.freenet.de to read news.  It is incredibly
fast, has several months of retention, and never seems to lose a post.
You have to use your reader to post, which can be a slight headache,
and it doesn't allow binaries, but that's another topic entirely.
Bad newsreaders should be complained about to your ISP.  If they don't
fix it, switch ISPs.  
It's not that fucking hard to run a decent newsserver these days,
unless you want to allow binaries, and then it's just an issue of disk
space and not having stupid switches.  I don't even think the old FDDI
head-of-line-blocking issue is relevant since 100BaseT and Gig-E
became the standard, and almost all disk arrays default to those two.
