Unfortunately there seems to be no respect for ppls camps on FV. People
continually come along to camps and expect other people or groups to
"share". Some dont care, they just pull what they like, and too bad if you
were camping it already. Maybe they are just roleplaying someone without
manners, but I wouldnt be cheering about the community on FV. Personally I
think if youre the sort that wants to take over someone elses camp, you
should go to a pk server and do it where the other party can do something
about it.
