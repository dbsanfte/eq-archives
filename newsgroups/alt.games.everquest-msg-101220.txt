Unfortunately, I see it all the time on the Tunare server. It doesn't
surprise me, though... people are generally only concerned about themselves
and will do anything for a quick buck. In other words, people suck, so
expect this sort of behavior everywhere.

It's like when the FRSS dropped on Tunare. When I found it, I saw it was
about 10% Haste and naturally the scammers were claiming "Slightly above
FBSS speed."
