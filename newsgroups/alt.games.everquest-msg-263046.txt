That is the primary reason I think.

As a corollary to that, no drop items don't contribute to the mudflated 
economy, because they don't move around. The uber no-drop sword of 
godliness from last expansion won't find its way onto a level 5 alt.

If they made no drop items tributable, they would likely find that 
droppable items, by and large would cease to be tributed at all again 
unless the tribute values were restored to their pre nerf level (with 
the exception of obvious gaffes like animated bait...)

That said, I think their should be *something* you can do with no drop 
gear, even if they could be vendor sold for pp (and didn't show up on 
vendor inventory). Can anyone think of a good reason why NOT?

If the only barrier is "RP" well then SOE has abandoned that anyway, 
plus you could make up some song and dance about how your really just 
melting it down or something...

Another thing they could have done is have guild tribute should run on 
no drops, while personal tribute runs on droppables.
