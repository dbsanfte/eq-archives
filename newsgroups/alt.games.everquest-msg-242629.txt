Oh yes, enchanters get good runes and a very fast casting deaggro spell.
As much as I love arcane Rune (lvl61) I do hate boggle (the deaggro
spell). It is fast casting...sure. But it can be resisted and burns mana
like there is no tomorrow. Add to that the fact that I always look for
more spellgems (what? all 8 slots already in use? can't be...) I haven't
loaded boggle anymore in a long time.
