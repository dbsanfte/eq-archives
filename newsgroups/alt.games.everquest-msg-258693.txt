I've played a woodelf warrior to 15 so far almost exclusively solo. It's 
not that difficult at all. The only thing the OP will be missing out on 
is Paludal Caverns' (from the Shadows of Luclin expansion) xp bonus from 
15-24 which, IMO, is highly overrated. The xp may be faster to obtain, 
but then again, it would have to be to warrant tolerating the total 
boredom of grinding for so long on top of one hill and the necessity to 
put up with the typical juvenile mindset in that zone.

Druid or necro, maybe. Beastlord was also from the SoL expansion, was it 
not?

Are the PoK books available without PoP now? Also, kill any plague rats 
you find (tails are worth over 1pp each at a merchant) as well as any mob 
you see carrying a staff (cracked staves are also worth over 1pp each).

Too many people tend to believe that the only way to play is to shortcut 
everything you can and that nothing else makes sense. It's not a 
necessity. To each their own, but personally, I'm having a great time 
having started over on a different server where I have no higher level 
characters on the server from which to obtain resources such as plat or 
gear. I have basically started over and am enjoying experiencing the game 
as a newcomer might. Whereas before I have farmed tradeskill components 
(spider/spiderling silks, animal hides, etc.) for hours on end so that I 
could sell them in the Bazaar for top dollar and put the proceeds toward 
buying gear that I, at my present level, couldn't possibly obtain from 
the creatures that dropped it. Now, I only collect these tradeskill 
components during the course of searching for blue-con or higher mobs 
which will give me xp. If I happen across a green spiderling, sure, I 
might just take it out and grab any silk it might drop, but I don't go 
out of my way for it. Also, these components will be used primarily to 
support my own tradeskill progression. I'll likely do my share of farming 
later, but I intend for it to be purely in support my own tradeskills, 
not for sale in the Bazaar. Farming for plat is just one more of the 
boring aspects of this game, and that's the last thing I want.

I *highly* recommend the newbie armor quests. Though some are admittedly 
very tedius, they provide excellent gear for the low level player. I 
might recommend a barbarian for a warrior. The Halas newbie area is one 
of the best and, although I've never tried the barbarian warrior newbie 
armor quests, the barbarian shaman quests are *much* easier than those 
for other races/classes I've played.
