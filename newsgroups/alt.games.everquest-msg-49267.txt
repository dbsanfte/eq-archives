I think maybe i'm suggesting that the learning rate should be a bit higher
(like double) on FV, or that races other than humans should start out 
knowing a little human. 
As it stands, travel is basically impossible for the first 10-20 hours of
play time on FV. It might get better later, when there are higher level
characters around who can act as translators... So far (level 7 halfling
warrior, played 15 hours maybe a couple AFK) all languages but 
halfling are gibberish.

If languages are indeed picked up with /say, perhaps we'll start seeing
congregations of language classes, for example in EC tunnel at the entrance.
