First thing's first, TURN OFF THE FUCKING HTML!!!!!!! THIS IS USENET,
NOT THE FUCKING WEB! Shit doesn't even belong in email as far as I'm
concerned...

*ahem* Now, go to options on the first menu screen (the one before you
enter your password). It'll have a list of races and check boxes for
male/female. Any one without a check is using the old models. The more
models you have on, the more memory the game needs to run relatively
smoothly. All models require at least 512MB. With the Luclin models,
you'll be able to change not only just the face, but eye color, hair
color, facial hair, and so on (Give or take a few options depending on
whether the option is relevant for the race - example, Vah Shir and
Iksar don't have the hair or facial hair options)
