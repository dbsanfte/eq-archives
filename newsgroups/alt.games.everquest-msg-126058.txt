Boy, ain't that the truth?  I played with a few newbie friends for a
month before we started 'getting it'.  We were around lvl 10...
*sigh*, man were we lame.  :-)

I have a lot of friends and guildies who left for DAOC when it came
out and have been trickling steadily back to EQ over the last 6
months.  But then again, some haven't come back and some quit the
genre altogether.  I guess there was really no point to this
paragraph.

Give it a shot, you don't need all the expansions to get a feel for
the game.  Having the zones through Kunark will give you plenty of fun
places to be as a young character.  

So try it again.  If you like it, then you'll want to pick up Scars
and Shadows most likely.  If you don't like it, then you're just out
$12.
