Good again, bear in mind two things. A) no charm and b) the rares
there are all sorts of nasty, like Heartstriker nasty. Quad 1.6K. Just
FYI... went after one with single cleric in group and he couldn't keep
up with my damage on defensive once furious was down. CH took too long
and SL couldn't be chained fast enough. Really needed an extra
patcher. Still lasted long enough to get the rare to 7% tho. I could
do trash pretty easily with only a cleric, but the cleric had to know
what he was doing and couldn't just phone in the heals like in Earth.
Ikkinz 1(group trial) I was told takes a minimum of 2 clerics to even
attempt and is basically Tipt x 2.

From my understanding, if you have the previous key.. its only a
matter of your guild being able to take out the AE Ramp mob in
Skyfire. Its still raid level requirement for access and no matter
what I don't believe there is a way your group can bypass it on its
own.

Yup. But bear in mind it goes away once you hit KT. Its definately an
efficient way to pick up some decent gear like Bracer of the
Heartstriker, Vxed pants, or your SK spells. And something like the
Heartstriker still needs to be tanked even if its going invul for the
12-24 seconds while the pet destroys the mob.

If you can hit KT, and have decent tradeskills or know people who do,
you can turn a lot of the tradeskill drops there into items and then
sell for plat.
