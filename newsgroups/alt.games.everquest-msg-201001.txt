There is such an ELITEST sentiment in this game that it kinda makes
the overall game loose it's appeal for me. I hear so much of the "I
did it so you can do it my way or you aren't any good" attitude and
the "I rule over you cause I am so Uber..." that it makes me sick to

Not really the kind of attitudes AI want to deal with. In game ot in
real life.
