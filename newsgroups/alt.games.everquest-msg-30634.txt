I play on RZ (54nec, 35 wiz, both pk's) and SZ (27 druid). I refuse to
play on blue servers, because they bore me to death. To me, exp'ing and
killing mobs is the bad part of the game, and PvP is the good part.

However, thats my opinion. Its plainly obvious that other people enjoy
blue servers and the generally non-competitive atmosphere they have, and
its not my business to tell them what server is "better". I suggest you
just stick to playing PvP and leave all the bluebies to do the things
they enjoy.

The only time I really complain about "bluebies" is when they DO come to
a PvP server and their expectations arent met. Of course PvP isnt fair
most of the time in eq, you have to stack the odds as much in your
favour as possible. I hate the people who play on a PvP server, have
*stayed* on a PvP server with multiple chars for many months, even
years, and continue to bitch about PvP. However I've got no problem with
people playing blue servers, its their choice and it has no effect on
me.
