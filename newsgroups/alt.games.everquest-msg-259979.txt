I play on Final Fantasy which has a similar mechanic (except once it's 
taken no one can attack it unless the attacker calls for help, which 
means no one gets jack)

The game is 'mature' at this point. This is one of the handful of things 
that bugs the hell out of me in Final Fantasy on line. People follow one 
simple rule. If its not purple (claimed), it's available. I've seen it 
referred to as 'leap frogging' or jackrabbiting on a few forums.

This is not the 'PS2 idiots' crowd either, it was going on well before 
the American PS2 launch. It's not the Japanese, the identifiably JP 
parties I've run into have been very courteous. By autotranslator I've 
made deals with more than a dozen JP parties. Split spawns, you take 
that side we stay over here, etc.. If a party mostly speaks English, 
they are not interested in what I'm saying, or they will agree, and as 
soon as their side clears will come over anyway.

(As an aside, if FF Warriors are the ultimate leap froggers. Ranged 
attacks take several seconds to 'fire'. Spells have a casting time. 
However Warriors get 'provoke' which is a short range taunt, that fires 
almost instantly. Only the games somewhat less than responsive interface 
slows them down a bit. I only mention it because I kept getting my stuff 
in WoW 'leapfrogged' by people with insta cast spells. I'd start 
casting, they'd step up and blast. I had to work real hard because I 
found myself doing the same damn thing for several fights after I first 
got my insta cast nuke. I made myself stop using it though. It's not 
mana efficient anyway.)

Quite frankly, having played and or watched a great deal of EQ, DAoC, 
AC, AC2, SWG, FFXI, AO, and a couple of other games I've played or seen 
played, I find it amazing to say this but EQ by and large has the most 
courteous players in MMOG'dom.
