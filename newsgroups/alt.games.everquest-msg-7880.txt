Has something happened to the /con command?  Has anyone else noticed this, I
am in Lake of Ill omen, I am hunting Beasties that /con blue, up until I
arrived there, I have been getting various blue messages depending upon the
lvl of the beasty.  Now all that is blue, gives the same message when
/con'd.  I know that they are different lvls and should give a different
message, I have checked the lvls at a site with a beastiary, some should be
harder to kill blues than others.  I kill some without breaking into my
second health bub, some almost wipe me out.  I checked the text log, and I
am hitting just as often and so are my DD spells.  Anyone else noticed this,
maybe its just me, or just Loio?
