It seems like all of the guilds forming on AB are high level guilds for
raids for people that were in high level guilds on other servers... I made a
new bard on there, I'm only at level 5 today so it's a bit early to worry
about guild membership, but I hardly see anyone underlevel 50 in a guild so
was wondering if there were any guilds on there for general experience
getting at lower levels, and the occasional low level dungeon raid,
orgainising binds, that kind of thing.... I don't see any so far.
