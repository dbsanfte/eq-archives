Like others have stated, FT stacks with Clarity. Also items with FT
stack with each other (up to 15), so 2 items with FT1 will give you 2
mana additional per tick.

I dont know how long youve been away, but if its been a very long
time, you no longer have to have your spell book open to med. Just
plant your butt and you are automatically medding (provided you have
the skill).

Many items have the effect Regen 1-2-3 etc just like FT and it works
the same as FT for health.

One easy FT item to get is the Earring of the solstice
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12456

You can get the components in the bazaar for around 5k (last time I
checked).
