It must be summer in Norrath: the entire planet is 
closed for construction.
  A little note to Sony:

  SLOW DOWN!!!!

  DAMMIT! I'd like to quit my job and play EQ 16 hours
a day as much as the next guy, but SOME of us have to 
pay the rent and put food on the table somehow. I don't
have the time to keep up with all these expasions; I've
barely visited half the zones that were available when 
I started playing. And I don't think the population of 
my server is growing as fast as Norrath itself; which 
means dilution of zone populations - many once-popular
zones like LOIO, Befallen, and Burning Woods are empty
more often than not these days. There aren't always LDoN
groups in my level range, either. 
  Quite simply, the casual player can't keep up. Stop
expanding the game at a rate designed for the hard-core 
full timers and let the rest of us catch up. Please!!!

  EJH
