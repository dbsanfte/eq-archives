That is by far, hands down, no contest, the best necro site on the web.
Right now its kind of broken, and they pretty much only have the forums
up, but even with just forums, its the best place.  Ask a question and
you will probably have a response within 15minutes during most times of
the day.

The best race for a power gamer is an Iksar.  Regen!  They got a steep
racial xp penalty though.  If you dont want to be a lizard, the next
best power gamer race is probably Erudite.  DE is close stats wise
though (and my personal choice), and full time ultravision is worth a
lot.  I would avoid Human.  And I would never be caught dead playing a
gnome or halfling, at least not seriously.

In terms of faction, gnomes are the best.   I'd add that where you can
sell/buy is really only important if you dont know anyone in game, or
are looking to maximize plat, as opposed to xp.
