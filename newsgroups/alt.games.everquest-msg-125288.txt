If you want a book to kiss your ass, it's good to have a copy to sit on.

It's also good, in principle, to keep your enemies where you can see them.

Also... She only said that one particular verse could kiss her ass.  I've 
found that the bible is a large and varied enough book that even its 
strongest detractors can find some value in it, somewhere, if they're 
wiling to look.
