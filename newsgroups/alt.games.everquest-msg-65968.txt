Problem first, you prolly don't really want to read my ramblings on the my
view of the game.

To upgrade/Patch I installed at work and patched then burnt to 2 CDs and
copied back to HDs at home, backing up important files. The problem I get is
the error messages that it was unable to find eq.tmp and defaults.eal (both
are in the EQ directory) where are these meant to be or should I say, where
does it expect to see these? If I click cancel then the game will run anyway
but never had this message before.

Well, picked my copy of SoL last night (and another again this morning, 2
accounts, doh, need 2 copies) Installed it and patched, first time I logged
into character select I get a black screen, try again, get a to selection.
Log both systems in.
My Dark Elf now looks, different..in a good way. The Fine Steel armour on my
Half Elf Bard looks amazing (and he holds his left arm in a really camp way
which is great, very funny considering how I often play him)
My Wood Elf druid...hmm not so good...Human races? Oh dear...well the
barbarian bodies now resemble Conan (male ones, that is) but their faces are
so poor as goes for all the human races, not impressed at all. Dwarves look
good, Halflings look erm, well I will not be using that model, High Elves
look good and trolls are an improvement of sorts, less imposing than before,
which is a shame. Ogres I am not that impressed with but they aren't so bad.
Iksars are still good not sure what I prefer there and VS...look a bit too
cute for my liking but no real complaints.

New wolves are good, new skeletons, not so sure about but I have no choice
on them.

The DX8.1 upgrade really helped my other system (non SoL) everything runs
super smooth with no frame loss that I can see at all (it's not a bad system
tho PIII 600@800 384mb ram and 64mb KryoII) My main system running SoL def
has frame rate loss but only in extreme circumstances, like the tunnel in EC
but I think I can live with it, it'll improve as I start to drop models (was
running all of them)

Given the faces used on all the models, full face helms are now an essential
fashion accessory
