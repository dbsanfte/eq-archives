I can't tell you the history, but this does seem to be a systematic
design decision on their part.  I am vaguely aware of several instances
when vendor prices were changed to prevent making a profit from vendors
on tradeskilling.

Broadly, it can be thought of as a design philosophy.  If you want to
get rich, you need to kill things and loot their corpses.  The
designers don't WANT a viable pathway to untold riches by sitting at
home, sewing quilts or whatever.  They want you to get out there and
beat up on monsters, risking your character's life in the process.

If there were a viable way to make money from vendors by tradeskilling,
some folk would do just that.  For zero risk, you could eventually have
unlimited funds.  Looking to buy a Blade of Carnage (or other uber
item)?  You can either (a) kill the mob that drops it, with a few dozen
of your closest friends, (b) kill LOTS of other mobs, selling scores of
other powerful artifacts, or (c) make 10,000,000 quilts to sell to a
vendor for a tiny profit each.  Someone decided that choice (c) just
isn't what the game is about. :)  I won't do more than mention the
issue of macros or 'bots...
