Well, all I have is experience and observations, that's really all we can 
rely on to predict what will happen. My experience over many years of play 
in many MMOGs tells me that game mechanics that produce certain behaviors 
today are likely to continue to produce those same behaviors (albeit in 
different degrees) tomorrow. If your argument is about degress, fine.

And your "evidence" for that is one experience that you keep harping on, the 
Stromm server. As though that were the sole source of experience in the MMOG 
world. I can't speak to that particular anecdotal event because I did not 
participate in it, but if it goes against the combined experience that I, 
Ben, bizbee, and others have expressed in this thread alone, I'm more 
comfortable with that experience than yours, particularly when you present 
your view in such an argumentative fashion.

Why don't you just relax and contribute to the discussion without feeling 
the need to insult people? If you have a valid point to make, I'm open to 
hearing it. If you're just in the mood to get tangled up in a flame, then 
I'll pass. Nothing personal, I'm sure you're up to it, I just don't feel 
like it right now. Would rather be playing.
