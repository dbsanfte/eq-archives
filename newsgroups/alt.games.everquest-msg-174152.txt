You *do* understand that the worst response to terrorism is to make the
changes the terrorist want, right?  They killed their own cause when they
killed 4000 people in one day.  It's no longer a question of "should we
listen to them."  Now, it's not even an option.  If we move even an inch in
the direction they want us to go, we've justified their means.

I also don't agree that Bin Laden is in it for political means, other than
his own political gain.
