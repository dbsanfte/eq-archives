I had a good time with him and would probably still be playing with him, but an
old friend came back to EQ and we started over fresh on Firiona Vie, so now I'm
a 16 gnomage.

Unlike my druid, though, who I tag as retired at 34, I am interested in leveling
up and playing around more with the enchanter, likewise my 51 shaman, 57 bard...
actually, I don't even say "retired" about my 65 cleric, heck, I -could- get all
interested in playing him again.  The druid was power leveled up for the sole
purpose of providing a porter for my buddy's alts (her main was a druid and
could port my main or alts) and abandoned with the release of POK.. heck, pretty
much with the release of SOL!

Splendid, 16 gnomage, Firiona Vie
