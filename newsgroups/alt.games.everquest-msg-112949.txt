WELL, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T GET ON ANYBODY'S CASE FOR SCREAMING IN ALL 
CAPS, I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM. =P

It's not so much a matter of whether it's "obviously understandable" or 
not. It's self-evidently *harder* to understand your posts than if you 
were to use proper capitalization, punctuation and spelling (after all, 
that *is* what capitalization, punctuation and spelling are for, to make 
things standard and thus easier to understand). 

If the content of your posts makes the extra effort worth it (as it is 
indeed the case, so far), I will make the effort to decipher them. If it 
didn't, I wouldn't. I think the matter is rather simple.
