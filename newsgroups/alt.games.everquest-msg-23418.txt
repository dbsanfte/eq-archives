While I agree with you that 10k is way overblown I ran around for a couple
of hours a few days ago carrying 6k (sold my swarmcaller) with sow up and
had only a marginal slowdown - think Iwas at about 270 lbs with a 
124, 140 lb limit (cant remember which strength buff I had on).

Uhm. this is so far off topic I might just shut up, but my point was
running with bucketloads of cash isnt as hard as you might imagine ;)
