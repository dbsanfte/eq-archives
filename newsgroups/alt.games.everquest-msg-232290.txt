I just use them as I get them. I don't stress over much about having to 
destroy them. I don't do contortions trying to preserve them. I'm not 
going to horde all my augments until I've reached end-game and can't see 
any item upgrades... because if I did I'd never use them... SOE would 
release another expansion, obsolete all my gear, and I'd be back at 
square one.

Apparently I die a lot more than you. :)

They could have broken up the points further. So that not only do you 
have Mistmoore and Guk points... but you also have 20s points, 30s 
points, and so on... and you can only spend 20s points on items with a 
recommended level of 20... 30s points on items with a recommended level 
of 30 or less... etc

Alternatively the merchants could simply refuse to show you things you 
couldn't use.

It amounts to almost the same thing. In the current implementation you 
can buy the gear but can't use it. That beats not being allowed to buy 
the gear.

One of the reasons why the planes are limited to 46+. Level 5 twink 
wannabes can't go.

Farm enough silk and you've *earned* the plat to buy a 'droppable' uber 
earing yourself too. But what they'd really like you to see you 
challenge some 65th level content before you can put it on... if all you 
can kill is 40th level mobs you aren't worthy to wear UBER earings... 
even if you've killed a lot of 40th level mobs and got the 'points'.
