}Odd.  I'm not noticing it.   All of the responses from these people appear
}to me to be in the proper threads.

To me, everything is in the proper thread, but it's all in a very random 
order within the thread.  I am wondering if the board software is 
datestamping posts properly, or marking them all in GMT or something, or 
on the basis of the clock on the individual poster's computer, rather 
than referring to a timestamp from an NTP server.

Generally, my threads sort on the date/time of the post, but I keep seeing 
replies to things that 'haven't happened yet'.
