How long were you in KC before you heard your first train call?  How long 
after your first train call did you hear someone say 'train right please'?  
If they answer to either of these is less than 10 minutes, you might want 
to ensure that you have /shout turned on.
I don't think anyone would be that upset if you did it wrong once, zoned 
back, and apologized because you honestly didn't know.  Congrats, you had 
your KC cherry popped.  Please train right from now on.
How do you decide which side of the road to drive on every morning on your 
way to work?
