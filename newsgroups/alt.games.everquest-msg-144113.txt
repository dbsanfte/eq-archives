Could be part of it, but I doubt it's the important part.  I think the 
thing is, you're assuming that (a) the going rate is in some undefinable 
way the 'right' rate, and should be inviolate, and (b) that the seller 
knows more about the buyer and what they can afford or not afford than I 
am.

Whatever this fellow decides to charge is kind of by definition 'the high 
end of the price scale', since the price scale is mre or less determined 
by what people charge and are willing to pay.  and obviously, someone was 
willing to pay it.

}Exactly, and that's still completely in line with what I wrote above,
}and previously. Let's go back to the batskull earrings for the OP again.
}Obviously, prices differ on various servers, but on Xev that items tends
}to be pretty easy to find for 100 plat. I've seen them advertised for
}125 and even 150 on occasion, and they might be the only one online
}selling one at that time. This is pretty much the range, day after day.
}If somebody has a few of them and just wants to dump them, they could
}probably come in and put them up at 25 plat. That would be lowballing.
}If the OP found them for that, then great, he saved some serious money.
}Me? I'd probably buy them myself, mark them up to 100 and put them back
}up for sale.

See, now how is that not an evil, slimeball scam?  You're depriving some 
needy newbie of a good deal by taking it off the market and marking it 
up...  I was thinking sadly of all the kunark armor you guys have been 
selling to vendors when I was shopping for singing steel for my lowbie 
bard the other day...

}But if one person is thinking how much he paid for them in
}GFay to some guy back when they were first out and figures he should get
}500 plat for them, he can mark them for that. But they won't sell.

Or, they might.  And then somehow he's a slimeball, you say, when 
obviously, he found a buyer who thought that that was a fair price for 
that item... Could it not instead be that the item is in some way widely 
underpriced, and if everyone would price it more in line with what it's 
worth, those poor newbies who are just trying to earn enough for an 
upgrade by selling their precious batskull earrings would not be horribly 
ripped off?  As a side note, 500 is a tad high on my server for a BS ear, 
but not very.  I have seen them priced that fairly regularly.

}Pre-bazaar, even if people did regularly sell them for 100 plat in GBay
}when they felt like stopping in to auction, the OP might have gone
}there, run into the jerk who knew that and still charged 500 plat, and
}gotten totally ripped off.

See, here you're assuming that the 'jerk' knew that.  Perhaps the 'jerk' 
went to allakhazam, saw it listed at 341pp, then went to eqprices, saw it 
listed at 410pp, and thought it might be reasonable to start the bidding 
at 500.  And lo and behold!  A buyer appears.  +5 int is rather a lot for 
an earring.  The next earring down, the +4 int golden sapphire ear, 
requires 115pp in components to attempt to make it (not to mention a 
reasonaby high jewelry skill).  But I guess jewelers aren't ever going 
to make a profit again, so that's rather moot. :)  6 int ears and 
most other 5 int ears I know of start at well over 1K, generally.  So 
perhaps the 'jerk' thought that 500 was a reasonable price for a 
medium-rare drop off a level 34 mob.  And perhaps if the newbie had told 
the 'jerk' that he only had 500 plat, perhaps he would have had several 
things in his bag that only had a few int each but added up to more than 5 
int, and perhaps the 'jerk' would have thought those were cheaper items.  
But that's all assuming that the newbie told him the situation.  It's 
quite possible all the jerk saw was

N00b tells you, "I will buy the bat ear. Where r u?"

followed by a trade window with 500pp in it.

}This is one of the primary reasons why I think the bazaar is such a huge
}boon to the buy, and in particular, the newer player.

It is, no question.  But I don't think that makes people who charge high 
prices 'scum'.  It just makes them expensive.

The other place we disagree is in your assertion that 'haggling is good 
roleplay' is a load of hogwash and only slimeballs would use that 
argument.  I think haggling is very good roleplay, and I'm saddened to see 
the bazaar kill it off.  On the plus side, though, people so rarely 
bothered to haggle properly that it's hardly any loss.  I ask you a price, 
you're supposed to have a price to tell me, so we have a place to start, 
dammit, none of this "ooo... you tell me what you think it's worth, so I 
can see if you're gonna guess wildly wrongly and then refuse to sell to 
you if you're too low without even giving you a hint what I think it's 
worth", that was bullshit, it was way too time consuming, and I'm glad to 
see that go the way of the dodo.  But haggling in foreign countries where 
such things are regularly practiced has always been a pleasure.  And a 
couple times I've managed to find people in EQ who knew how it went, too, 
and that was fun.
