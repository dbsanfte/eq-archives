    Rampage was created after the original game was created. And when it was
made, a design decision was made to have it not be cleared by zoning. Had
Rampage been in the original game I might accept what you've written.

    The third part is not mine, and it is incorrect. Zoning does not exist
solely to clear a hate list. But that is one of the intended uses of zoning.
This was further bolstered when GMs across the game ruled that players
camping near a zone line, then zoning if things went badly, were not
exploiting.
