Based on what I've heard of VP, that'd have to be the one place in
pre-luclin Norrath where "Team Manaburn" truly belongs.  VP is hardly
the same as racing to squish Talendor or Gorenaire or Severilus (sp?)
ahead of some low-/mid-tier guild trying to get epic drops or gear up
a few of their members with stuff that the "ubers" take for granted
(or even sneer at as inadequate).  VP is hardly routine (or even
possible) for guilds that require a major effort to kill Talendor or
Sev, and these are the guilds that're hurt by "Team Manaburn".  And
after taking a look at the arrogant pos of a webpage somebody linked,
I'll say that the manaburn nerf definitely rates as the "best ever".
