> It looks like Allakhazam is going to "pay for the good stuff"

the costs (time and money) involved in running this site must be *huge*. If
you have taken the time to read ( I am not saying you havent read it) his
comments in the past about the effort, time and money he put into this site,
you would understand his reasoning, and IMHO he is quite entitled to take
this action. Also his "fee" is more than reasonable, $US9.99 for 3 months is
a VERY fair amount. This site is one of the best sites around, not just for
EverQuest, but for all gaming genres, and I doubt there would be many gaming
sites that would come close to total amount of information it provides.
Comerical web sites (online databases) would be envious of the design and
functionality of this site too. If you dont like it, dont use it.

User pays baby.
