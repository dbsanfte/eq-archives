FYI, my system runs EQ2 just fine as well.

Intel P4 2.8 GHz - ASUS P4S8X
80Gb HD Western Digital LC
1Gb 266 DDR RAM
ASUS Geforce4 Ti4600 128Mb
Resolution set at 1280 x 1024
EQ2 set at Balanced performance

This seems to run EQ2 well enough with small amounts of triangle cut lines
which will only pop up when I have more than two game information windows
open at the same time, such as character and knowledge window or when
someone is standing in the same spot as my character.

I've bumped it up to the highest quality graphic mode and it worked but it
was slow with many triangle line pop ups, the setting just above balanced
works but gets lagged during large amount of NPC or PC traffic on screen and
occasional triangle pops.
