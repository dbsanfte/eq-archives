Str is first and foremost, as long as all your other stats (except cha) are
75 or better, if they are under 75 you suffer penalties. All stats are easy
enough to raise in higher levels but str reigns supreme for a warrior
because your atk is generated from that 1 stat (along with level/weapon
skill). Forget dex for procs, once you break 50 the mobs you'll be fighting
will 80% resist procs (except possibly the warrior epic proc)
