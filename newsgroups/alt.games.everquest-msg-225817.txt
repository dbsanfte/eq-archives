Noooo! If that happens you'll see a whole bunch of unhappy Shammys...

Heh, yep. It's the dawn of a new era for melee combatants. Real-time
decision making across a broader spectrum of choices with honest-to-god
tactical considerations to take into account. Are the big brutes up to it?
It's gonna be like watching some lumbering high-school lineman suddenly
being drafted into the NFL and required to understand and execute a
playbook.

I agree with this view, although I know there are many here who don't. As I
see it, being the best at sustaining damage isn't nearly as powerful if you
aren't also the best at re-directing (to yourself) and holding that inbound
damage.
