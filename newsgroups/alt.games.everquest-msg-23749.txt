Is that series still going? i gave up on the sixth, the first four were an
excellent read though. 
Unless youre cruising around the world LOTR is a bit much but you could try its
prequel the hobbit. Anything by David Gemmel, Raymond e feist or terry
brooks(though im not so keen on his stuff myself). Or even terry pratchett for
a more light hearted fantasy read.
