Someone posted this on the GU forum, apparently straight from the
patcher notes:

"To Our Players 12/18/2004 8:30 pm 

Hello Everyone, 

We sincerely apologize for the downtime this weekend. We had some
hardware issues that caused us to have to tread very carefully in
bringing the game back up. We wanted to triple check everything to
make sure there wouldn�t be any major problems, and it�s taken a while
to both fix the problem (we had to fly out engineers from one of our
hardware vendors) and to bring each of the servers back online because
of the careful validation process we need to go through. We have to do
this very carefully and we hope you can understand our desire to do
this right. We're trying to balance that with getting the game back up
as quickly as possible. So far most servers are back up and the rest
should be up in the next 4-6 hours, hopefully less. I realize that
ETA's that come and go can frustrate people, so we do our best to give
you the most realistic estimates possible. 

Out of respect for our players, we�re doing the following: 

1) Every player will receive 3 free days. 

2) Early this week (Monday or Tuesday) we will have a 24 hour period
where we will have accelerated XP gain. Details are still being worked
out and we�ll communicate this to you as we firm up the plans. 

We are committed to providing you with excellent service. Our team has
been here for over 40 hours straight, and I can tell you our
dedication to doing right by our players is the thing that�s foremost
on everyone�s mind here at SOE. 

Thank You, 

John Smedley"
