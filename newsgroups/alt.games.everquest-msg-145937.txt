Broken but trivial to fix this time.

The patch included a couple of XML files. The game will be looking for
those files. If you tell the PC to look for XML files in you modded
directory, it won't find them. Put the newly patched XML files in there
and it acn find them - viola.

This obviously assumes you haven't modded the files concerned, but this
patch only changed the bazaar and actions XMLs, rarely modded and not
crosslinked.

The only times there are problems with UIs is when a file you've modded
gets changed, especially the 'global' files like animations. Then you
need to either get a new version from the original author, or have a
fiddle around and fix it yourself.
