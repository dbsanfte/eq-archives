I can assure you my post was entirely tongue in cheek.

I've never ever met a necro eager to drop what he was doing to come SC.
Some will do it, certainly.  And its appreciated.  But they aren't eager.

Further, since this only applies to PoP zones, it doesn't matter to 99% of
the deaths out there one bit.

However, with druids and wizards crying out that their reason for being
has been nerfed, I thought it amusing to note that someone else has taken
a similar hit to functionality and not even winced on this newsgroup.
