I got my wife into EQ, and once a week we play with a friend; our
group is a cleric, bard, and SK, all currently in the low 30s.
My wife's really not into "grinding", so the usual mode of going
somewhere and killing mobs for xp and loot doesn't appeal to her;
she'd like to have some "in character" goal for what we're doing.

So I'm trying to find level-appropriate quests that can give us
some direction to our adventuring.  We thought Stonebrunt might
do the trick, but somehow our faction with the kitties there is
bad (not too surprising for the dark elves, but we were startled
when they attacked our Vah Shir).  So we're still looking.

Can anyone suggest some areas with quests -- preferably a series
of related quests -- suitable for a half-sized group of level 35
or thereabouts?  (And where dark elf and vah shir won't run into
faction trouble?)  The "stories" needn't be deep; the Halloween
quests worked okay for us.

Thanks in advance,

	-- Don.

p.s.: LDONs are so-so; they get monotonous too quickly.  Though
we're considering trying a "rescue" mission as a change of pace.
Can a threesome handle one of those?  And can you affect the
level (and rewards, of course) of an LDON by shrouding down and
then removing the shroud after you accept the mission, as you
could with some of the Halloween tasks?
