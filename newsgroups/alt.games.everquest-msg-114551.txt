I don't understand what part of "being happy for someone else's 
accomplishment" bothers you, or what never having met them before has to do 
with anything; would you withhold a heal from a player in dire danger 
because you haven't met them before? Does the fact that you don't know them 
make their need less real? Why is their happiness any different? I don't 
shout `Ding!` myself (well, I did at 50, so sue me), but I will normally 
join in the chorus of congratulations, because I'm actually *able* to 
relate to that person's joy, even if I've never met them before. It's 
called empathy, and it's no crime.

As far as those individuals being sad... let's get real here. We're all a 
bunch of nerds who spend waaaay too much time playing a videogame, or else 
writing about it. I don't think any of us really has the right to refer to 
any other players as "sad", least of all to those players that at least 
appear to be having fun and take the time to share their enjoyment, and to 
let others know that, no matter how hard the grind gets, eventually, the 
Ding! comes.

I really cannot understand how hearing Ding! from someone, *anyone* else 
can actually fail to cheer anybody up (having said that, I prefer Dings 
over /ooc, which is where they belong).
