The devs explained it a while back. Apparently it has to do with NPC
buffing, pathing, and LOS all mixed together - Plane of Hate had a
similar problem, but its ten times worse in Seru.

The dev said fixing the problem would mean repathing Seru, a job that
is big enough it is effectively remaking the zone, and the zone just
isn't worth the effort at this time.
