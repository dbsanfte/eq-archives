I have nearly the exact same setup (Dell Inspiron 6000D) with the following 
upgrades:

Windows XP Pro (maybe not an upgrade, just a matter of preference)
1.5GB DDR2 SDRAM
ATI Radeon X300 64MB graphics

Though my hard drive is only 40GB.

EQ is unplayable on this machine. I mean it runs, and I can use it for a 
Bazaar mule or inventory transfers and such, but everything is in dreadful 
slow motion.

Oddly, the laptop I bought over 3 years ago (Toshiba Satellite P4-
M/1.7GHz/512MB RAM/GeForce4 440 Go 32MB graphics) runs EQ just fine with 
most new models turned off.
