Well, I only have a general observation to offer:

Well, all I can say is watch your asses in all the Karana's. A whole slew of
new mobs got thrown over the Karana's when jagged Pine went live on
Stormhammer so I am guessing they will eventually trace back to Jagged Pine
somehow.

The astute may have noticed a mightier than Grimfeather "Silver Griffon"
flapping menacingly around NK. on EK I came accross a new NPC chain wearing
guy who upon naturally slaying I gained positive faction hits with around
Jagged Pine good factions (bleh) and negative factions with some sort of
Jagged Pine Pirates or something odd.

Add them together with your SK "learning experience" and combined with the
timing of their emergence it all seems to point to new JP realated content.
