Agi has nothing to do with offensive skills only defensive. Cleric advance
in offensive and defensive skills much slower then a fighter 3 skill points
per level verses 5 points for a tank. Clerics can fight to some  degree in
lower levels but around the teens you will start lagging behind. As far as
your 1 hit out of 10 I would looking into a faster lower damage weapon, and
Dex items to increase your other offensive skills. Atk is the main factor
for successfully making contact as far as I know and it is controlled by
Weapon skill Strength and Offensive skills you can try some Str buffs to
boast it some.
