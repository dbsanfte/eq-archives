So why then would (or should) you care in either case? Why would you (or 
anyone else except the farmers & twinkers) care whether or not a certain 
piece of loot drops off a greenie. Please help me understand cause it 
makes NO sense to me. Is it the "Give me liberty or give me death" 
posture where it's your "right" to be ABLE to do this or is it that you 
just flat out lied?

And? So??? What is the problem with the loot codes? You said yourself 
you wouldn't do it.. so the only reason.. .oh say a 60 wizard is in 
Runnyeye for hours on end is to farm? I ran into a dumbass shaman the 
other day... he told me my level 6 SK couldn't play near the ruins 
because (his words) "he heard that newbs running near the ruins would 
cause Pyzjin NOT to spawn". Ya know I get kinda tired of hearing BS like 
this. So what could I do? His pet was red to me.. I can't compete so I 
have to go somewhere else. I'm sorry but that is just sad and pathetic. 
And unfortunately that is most farmers attitude.

So?? Nice to hear you're uber. You must actually go kill appropriate 
levels to get your gear. Well congratulations. What would you say if you 
had to compete with someone 10+ levels above you to get your "uber" 
gear. I kinda think your position would be a tad different. Where did 
you get your stats from. I've certainly not noticed those thousands 
leaving... as a matter of fact I'd certainly welcome it. A thousand less 
farmers and kewlios is probably what EQ needs anyway. Good riddance!
