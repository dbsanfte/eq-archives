As a side point your last pet heal until 44 is at level 20 so an Improved
Healing I item will do you quite fine till then.  I personally use a Turtle
Shell Helm (5AC +3Str) with my mage on the Test Server (though I haven't
played him in ages).  You get two pet heals at 44, a standard heal and the
LoY added HoT spell, and then your next pet heal is at 52 so you may just
want to invest in an IH3 item at 44 if you can afford one by then (I know
they can be quite costly) instead of using an IH2 item for 8 levels.

Anyway, enjoy your mage, very fun class.  And I did duo with a shaman with
my mage around 28 or so in EW and I noticed things dying significantly
faster with the stat buffs and the added healing is definitely nice.
