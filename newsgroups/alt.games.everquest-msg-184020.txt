eqtraders.com. If you make the dyes yourself, you'll need over 80 in
pottery and brewing to make them reliably. Once you have the skills,
be prepared to spend around 30pp per slot you want to tint, assuming
successful combines. You can also buy the "Vial of Prismatic Dye" in
the bazaar off players who have made it, but if you go that route,
expect somewhere around 50pp per slot. (What's crazy is some people
were charging 1kpp per dye Monday)
