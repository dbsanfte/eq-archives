I have recently returned to EQ after a time away, and have got a new
computer since I last played. I used to have the problem with my old system
once in awhile, but if I rebooted, it wouldn't happen for a couple days
again. Since playing again, it seems after I zone 3 or 4 times, I crash back
to the server select screen while zoning, and then I may or may not be able
to get back in the game without it locking up my computer.

Has anyone had this problem and solved it? Many thanks for any suggestions
