Yup. Thats  the case. Disease based slows are just flat out necessary, and
totally inaccessable to both the Elf, and Peck teams. As far as Dark Druids
go theres even in-game lore to support such a change. Theres the whole
"Unkempt Druids" faction that could be used as a starting point for Dark
druids. PErsonally I Would have LOVED playing a DE Druid ;)
