I'm having a little fun twinking out a Barb Shaman at lvl6. I just bought a
full suit of banded armor and am a bit over my hit points with an almost
empty inventory. Can anyone recommend some decent +STR items that are
actually available. I've seen a few items somewhat regularly such as the
cougar claw and orc fang earrings and a few decent rings, but not much
beyond that. I can spend a few hundred plat on them and would like items
with some AC or HP also, but I realize that may quickly get out of my price
range.

Also, can this char, by default, use a shield of somesort? I see no skills
that indicate "shield usage". What is the effect?

Thanks all, you're always a huge help.
