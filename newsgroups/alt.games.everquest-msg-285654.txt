My turn... since Lance hasn't commented...

It took almost 3 hours to get the patcher to recognize a connection, then, 
relative quick process to login, and be taken to a blank server screen. 
Then, I chose to chat, and they were "Chat channel full" on all the generals 
that I tried to get into, and maelinstarpyre never did let me in, so I 
logged back out...

Then, I went to EQPlayers, and lo and behold... all servers are showing up 
and running... no news or warnings or attempts to inform on the main page 
about any issues, so I returned, logged back in... to .... you guessed it... 
no servers listed and only chat available, but all channels either not 
allowing entry or full...

So, what gives... is it possible that in today's age of technical wizardry, 
that the SOE staff are just too ignorant, or too lazy to update their 
primary method of information to any of us that might question what's going 
on?

As much as I love this game, I'm wondering if my money might be better spent 
elsewhere...

Probably not... I do love the game...

Just my 2cp
