Before they put in the ability to hide corpses, it was possible for Fear to
become unbreakable.  A guild on my server wiped out on the break, then wiped
out on the recovery, and it went downhill from there.  The final result was
something like 150 corpses at the zone-in, with all the mobs up.

Anyone who zoned in dropped to something like 1/5 frame/second from all the
corpses, and was quickly killed by the mobs, just adding to the problem.

Even though this was back in the days when the official policy was that
planes were completely unsupported and the GMs would not help, even to deal
with bugs, this one was so bad Verant had to step in--they couldn't ignore
that many people about to lose everything--and so the GMs depoped the zone
to allow corpse recovery.  Not too long after this, they added the command
to hide corpses.
