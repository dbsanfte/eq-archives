The point why i chose rain spells in some cases, is because it has a higher
damage potential, so i was afraid that if i didn't use them in the example,
many people would shout out. I mean, we all know a 3*250dd is alot more than
a 330dd GFLux, even though it never would stick due to some buggy coding
from VI. Plus it was the only thing a wizard is better at level 44 (Both
Enchanters and Wizards get the GFLux AE spell which is the best AE spell at
that level). At this level the best PBAE to wizards is the Thunderclap, and
that does around 220dd, so even GFlux outdamages that.

Another myth dies.... "Kings of solo" ends now.
Compared to a Necromancer, wizards falls short even when quadding and the
Necro is soloing 1 blue at a time.
