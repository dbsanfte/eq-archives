Heh...  By Level 30...  Their piercing/2hb/1hb skills suck so bad, they
wouldn't be able to hit very well. :)

Heck...  My 1HB/1HS on my Druid sucked so bad after a while, blue mobs are
owning me when I hit my 30s...  I resorted to doing Snare/Root/Dot/Nuke
measures til they are running, then try to practice my melee skills to max,
and  most of the time, you hear the 'Whiff! Whiff! Whiff! WHACK!'  By your
40s, its, "Why the hell do I even bother?" on blue mobs, cause even though
you should have something like 164 or so...  160 is a rating for 31 level
mobs to get consistant damage, and you are trying to hit mobs at level 33
or better.

My best example of this... My Cleric on another server...  29th level...
Grouped with a 30th level druid being assisted by a 40th level Druid for
PLing...  We tried to melee an HG, and Yes...  I know... HGs are in the 34
to 35 level.  What was funny... was that we did more damage with the Damage
shield on us than we did with our own melee ability.  We couldn't do much
in the nuking department, but having a 40th level druid help heal and DS
us, the HG killed itself for the most part trying to smack us hard.  And
yes...  I did the 'whiff, whiff, whiff...'  And kept whiffing a lot till I
was exhausted then just sat down while the other druid ran him around a few
more times. :)

I can only imagine how sucky a pure caster's ability is in melee, when they
can only get up to 93 at Level 30 for their weapon skills...  That is
like...  17th level mobs they can fight melee within reason with a
stick/poker.
