You assume entirely too much. Get back to me when you grow the fuck
up.

I, like apparently most people, remember well what I felt a year ago.
I don't need stuff being shoved in my face to dredge those feelings
back up. I don't *LIKE* those feelings. Tell me, your friends that
died last year...do you think they would rather you dwell on their
death or get on with your life, remembering the times you had to enjoy
together? Do you think they would be proud of you acting hateful
toward a company because they chose to respect the day quietly rather
than how YOU wanted to mark the day? Got some news for you, not
everyone mourns the same way. How DARE you criticize someone else for
not being exactly like you in the way they choose to do so, you
arrogant, stuck up, childish bastard. Narrow-minded prats are the
reason behind what happened last year. Don't act like one of them
yourself.
