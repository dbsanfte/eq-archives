Many mobs in Vah Shir require that you hand them your slate before they
will give you their quests.  Of course to add to the fun, at least one is
bugged so that he keeps the slate and does not give you a quest at all...

On the bright side, many of the mobs actually return incorrect quest
elements now.  I've handed almost every scorpion part I've found
to Spirituist Ragnar, for example, just in case he takes something besides
the poison glands.  No luck... but no loss since he gives everything
back!
