==================================

** Friday, August 23 2002.


** Sound and Music:

- We've started work on the sound and music engine. If you used to have
sound/music bugs, the first upgrade today might help a bit. This is the
first step down a long road. If your particular sound/music issue isn't
fixed, please be patient. There's no need to re-report existing sound/music
bugs.


** Gameplay:

- Experience: Post-50 characters will now gain far more experience from
hunting NPCs at or above their own level than ever before. This is a test of
a potential new system. Briefly, the idea isn't really that much of a
stretch: The larger the risk you take, the larger the reward should be.

- Experience: Post-50 "hell" effect levels are gone. There are no longer any
levels in EverQuest that are anywhere near twice as hard as their previous
levels. Please note: This does not change the amount of experience required
to go from "No experience in level 1" to "Full-bar in level 60." It's just
about smoothing out the trip.

- Resists: More work on the resist system. Please don't expect every spell
to resist exactly the same as it used to. However, do feel free to report
anything that you suspect is obvious brokenness. (Note: Whoever killed
Hobart's two-million HP Fire Beetle of Testing while we were at lunch - That
was mean.)


** Support:

- Two new commands to play with: /viewpetition, /deletepetition. You may now
review your existing petition. If you happen to resolve it yourself, you can
then delete it.


Have a great weekend,

- The EverQuest Development Team
