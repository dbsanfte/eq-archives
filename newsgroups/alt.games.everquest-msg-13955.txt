Your channeling skill is still pretty damned low... as it increases,
so will your ability to cast a spell through the distraction of
getting hit. For now, try to cast in between the mob's hits.

Later, if you're in a dungeon and get hit, try to stand up against a
wall so the mob can't knock you around with its hits - that improves
your chance of channeling a spell. The movement caused by a blow
interrupts spells.
