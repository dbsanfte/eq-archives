Actually I removed the "UseUmbra=FALSE" line from my eq client this morning
and it worked.  Now I remember when it failed, hehe.  When Luclin first came
out, my graphics card evidently didn't play nice with the Umbra engine.  I
disabled it and everything ran smoother, except underwater.  After
installing newest Detonator drivers and removing the gag on Umbra, they seem
to be working wonderfully now AND I can see underwater again!
