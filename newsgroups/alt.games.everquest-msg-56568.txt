It's not just Verant ... the concept is prevalent in IS shops everywhere, in
almost every industry I've written code for.  Hence the coinage of the word
"Implementesting".

btw ... please don't top post!  Old farts like me don't normally look to the
top of a Usenet post for anything other than the gist of the thread.  A top
posted Usenet post is like an Agatha Christie novel published with the last
page first!  :-)
