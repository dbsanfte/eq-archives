Now, I'm at the level where I need advice on a hunting grounds.  What I'm ideally looking for is a spot that a puller can pull do, with a limited amount of adds.  A spot tailored to a tank, that has healers.  (Basically, I find it difficult to cast anything other than heals & buffs with the occasional DD/DoT thrown in).  Anyways, I suppose I should lay out the group setup...

One sweet spot is the entrance to the Hole.   Elementals that
will come in pairs, will be a tough break for your little group
initially, but if you can manage to root-mez one of each pair
so you kill one at a time you can break things up so from
that point on you are pulling singles.  One method would
be to have the cleric do the initial pull with root (so the other
member of a pair comes) then atone the rooted mob so
you don't have to worry about it adding when root wears off.

The Hole has one of the largest ZOMs in the game, yet
this portion of it has static spawn mobs that come in two
at a time, allowing for the cleric pull.  They spawn at a regular
interval (which sadly I forget) that is fast enough to allow
most groups still getting blues to kill constantly.  Cash is
slow, but there is a no drop bow thats very nice, and
Imbued Granite Spaulders some of the best shoulders in
the game for warrior or cleric, droppable, and Iron Oxides
sell for about 1kpp each, all rare drop.

This spot is also a nice one for a player in a situation like
yourself, who is ready to solo (three box is still solo, sort
of) but who would prefer to group.  Other solo but
not by choice people often come here, so you might
find a partner or group to join.  You could leave yourself
three boxing with up to three more people and just pull
deeper and deeper in, or if more come you could cut
back to any two or even any one of your little group
to fill whatever slot they need filled.  Heck, you could
even swap in your chanter, who can group with anyone
up to 60 and still get exp.

Bring that chanter along anyway, to camp in and mind
buff both your healer bots.

Lets see, what else.  They run, snare is a must.  They hit
hard, you'll wish you had a slower, at any rate DS will
help since you don't.  Probably take you long enough to
kill each that DOTs will be useful rather than sticking to
DD.

For the sake of convenience you may wish to spend
a day running around in the Warrens nearby in order
to get at least one of your characters to non KOS
in Paineel, so you can use the vendors and bank, oh,
and I suppose a Key, although all my characters
have always just swum thru the crack, except for
my bard who finds it the only worthwhile lock he
can pick.
