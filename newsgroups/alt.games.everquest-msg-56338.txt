According to the patch message today, it's possible (but probably unlikely)
that you'll be able to zone into BB and type /corpse and it'll come to you.

I think it's unlikely because your corpse is already misplaced, before they
made the change.  I have few hopes that Verant will think about doing a
query after patching to say "hey, let's find the corpses that were lost
before today & move them to the "default location."

Go ahead & try /corpse, but don't be surprised if it doesn't work this time.
