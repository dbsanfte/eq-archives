You can find something about disciplines here:
http://eq.crgaming.com/disciplines/

In a way it is funny how the manual is written for EQ. I can't
remember reading anything about disciplines (though it is a long time
since I read it so I might be wrong) but there is also no description
of the spells .. so you have to travel the internet to know what the
different spells do.
