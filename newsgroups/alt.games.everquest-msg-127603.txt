The worst situation is that you loot everything, click done, and
your body vanishes.  Body gone, and as you suggest, you
are no longer rezable.

What happens sometimes, though, is that you loot everything
and are about to click done when you realize what you've done.

Normally a great deal of panic ensues, as you only have a couple
minutes hanging on to the body before you get kicked and, we
all expect, the body poofs... but no.  a few months back, I think
when they put the decay timer con-able on the bodies, they also
made it so getting kicked off your body leaves it up as though
it had an item on it.

Why loot your body at all?  Because you can get all your gear
and loot, and go back too adventuring while waiting for or just
hoping for a rez.  Any exp you get in the meantime still counts
for full.  Really that body is just a stored form of exp, generally
two blue worth waiting for someone to cast a spell to give it
to you.  Further, even if a rez is expected relatively soon, you
may get a wandering mob or you may be trained (heck, the
cleric that is coming to rez you may bring company!) and having
your gear on might make a difference as to how many of your
bodies need to be rezed!

This trick though, should be reserved for those rare "I'm an
idiot" moments where you've looted all but not clicked done.
It locks you in position for about three minutes, time you
could have spent hunting or medding or doing -something- more
interesting than staring at an empty body.  And it doesn't always
work.  Leaving an insignificant item on your body always works.

Best plan is to pick an item that you can replace easily and make
a point of -always- leaving that item.  No thinking involved.  For
most people this item is ammo slot.  If your character can't carry
any normal ammo items, get some bait and put it in there... you'll
never find anything more insignificant than that.

If you get a rez when you haven't looted yet, you should still
loot everything but that ammo slot first, then take a look and
make sure you really really mean to get rid of your body.  This
is the habit that keeps you from "dry looting" and losing the
potential exp.

Hmm, counter arguement:  Don't loot your body at all till your
rez is coming in, if it is in a dangerous spot, say at the Karnors
zone line.   When you get rez, the rez effects will drastically
lower your str temporarily, and you are immune to str buffs till
it wears off.  If you are naked you will still be able to run away,
cross zone line or something.  Fully geared up you will be
as stationary as if rooted!
