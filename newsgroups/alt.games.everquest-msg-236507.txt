I'd recommend not worrying about it.  Nearly everyone eventually makes
secondary characters for when they just feel like taking a break from their
main character.  Instead of busting your ass to do all the faction work to
take your DE Cleric everywhere, why not save those places for your other
characters?  That way, when you decide to try a Gnome Magician or Halfling
Ranger, for example, they will have starting cities that are fresh to you.
