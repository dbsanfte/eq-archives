Actually I don't think I'm undergeared really.  I got about 20kpp from
a friend at work (he quit) and went on a spree.  I have a few decent
items, although no haste regrettably.  But Architects Bejeweled BP, DW
helm and vambraces, WMBS, and a few others but those are the best.  So
for 34 not too shabby I think.

It's really not about money.  A guildie has it and I can get it for
free but I just don't feel I need it.  Besides, as you point out, it
really doesn't help if cleric is sub-39, which they all are that group
with me right now.

I don;t mind error and I don't even really mind wipes.  You learn what
you did wrong and enjoy the humor in "Loading, Please wait...".  The
jokes I've seen about that make me laugh every time I die.  Weird
maybe but I enjoy the game, not grinding.  I realize some people don't
so I do my best to play my role but sometimes things happen, I don't
think people should get too miffed about it as long as I don't afk in
the middle of a fight or something.
