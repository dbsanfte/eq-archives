	You don't need to fight blues to gain spell casting skills,
just combat.  You do need to practice casting to up spell skills, but
it can be on greens.   
	Some classes might actully be better if power leveled.  The
typical wizard might never melee enough to get decent skill.  The
power leveled wizard actually has time to gain defense skill as mobs
beat on the damage shielded wiz.  This power-leved wizard knows his
job is to cast, but he has a better defense skill should he over-nuke
and aggro the mob than the wizard who was always protected during his
level-ups.  The power-leveld warrior, whose job is the melee & keep
aggro, may not learn to be a master of all weapon types.  That same
power-leveled warrior should be pretty good with those weapon types he
has been using and should also know how to keep the mob off the guy
healing him.  
	On the other hand, would a power leveled druid know how to
kite or the taunt factor in snare?  Would the enchanter know which
mobs are more susceptible to charm or more resistant to mez?  Probably
marginally better than an EBay character but....
