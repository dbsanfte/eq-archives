Go quad the dire wolves in GD. They will get you to forty nicely and in
short time. Loot is rather craptastic, but you want xp, so it's a good
choice. Will also start building up some good Coldain and CoV faction
for you which may be an issue for grouping with your ubah friends later,
depending which side of the giant wars they are on.
