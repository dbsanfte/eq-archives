I also enjoy exploring. The problem is, I enjoy other activities more 
(questing, hunting, etc.) What that means is, the exploring doesn't get 
done much until the parts of the game I enjoy a bit more have been played 
out. Sadly, by that time, the benefits I would have gotten from more 
exploring along the way (ability to kill level appropraite stuff, 
happening across useful stuff, etc.) have been lost.

Therefore, though exploring *is* a desirable option, it is not one I 
typically wind up taking advantage of with other compelling travel 
options available. /shrug
