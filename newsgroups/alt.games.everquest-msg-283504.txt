I have the gloves that reduce sun vortex cost by 25%, which appear to be 
the better ones (the only other ones I see do 20%).  On the other hand, 
I can summon a bauble that reduces spell costs by 15% anyway, so this 
isn't as big a reduction as it seems.

Lets see

Firebolt, mana cost 515, reduced 15% is 438 mana for 2100 damage, 
roughly 4.8 damage per mana

Sun Vortex, mana cost 395, reduced 25% is 296 mana for 1600 damage, roughly
5.4 damage per mana.

So the ratio is better, but only because of the better focus.  I'm not 
sure which I specialized in its been so long, I know at one point it was 
conjuration because of pet canni, but since they killed that, I might 
have respec'd into evoc.  That might make things equal again, or it 
might give Vortex an even bigger lead.

Lets look at DPS assuming mana is no issue.  Both have the same recast 
time, 2.25.

Firebolt cast time is 7, which means 9.25 seconds per 2100 damage, 277 
DPS.

Sun Vortex cast time is 6.35, which means 9.1 seconds per 1600 damage, 
176 DPS.  So "burst" damage is better using the Firebolt.

That ignores foci and buffs which hasten casting time, but including 
them would only make things worse, since the Firebolt will show a bigger 
reduction, percentage wise, as the recast time won't be affected.

I know that by now 65 is hardly "endgame", but it was when I hit 65, and 
getting those spells was beyond my reach.  Finding out, a year and a 
half later, that I might be better off with a "mere" 61 spell is 
dissapointing.
