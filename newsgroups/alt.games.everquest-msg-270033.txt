And, of course, EQ1 has changed somewhat in that regard now too, Druids 
and Shaman got a zero xp rez AA that can be used to rez back in the real 
rezzer, who can then rez everyone and himself.  So now, if you have 
Cleric or Paladin, or Necromancer, or Druid, or Shaman survive, you can 
get back in business (assuming they have the rez spell/AA of course).  
EQ2 is certainly a lot friendlier in that regard, as the rez spell, and 
summon rez item are both low level.
