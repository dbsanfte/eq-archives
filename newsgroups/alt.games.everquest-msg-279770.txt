I remember the quote.  Paraphrased, it stated that the average level
character was under-50.  Something like that.  At the time, and now, I
thought it likely that they included all characters, all the level 1 bazaar
traders, forgotten low level alts, etc., and the wording wasn't crystal
clear (from Sony?  Imagine that...).  In my opinion the vast majority of
people in this game have a level 60+ character, the vast majority of the
remaining segment have a 50+ character.  Based on anecdotal evidence, the
reports of *true* newbies have been rare for a loooong time.

I think your percentage is off.

I also think you underestimate the number of raiders that actually have real
lives and lazy streaks.  

In other words, my raiding guild/alliance has...  60% of its *active*
members on per raid-night.  Active members will generally show up at least 3
out of 5 nights.  There's a lot of intra-week "rotation" that occurs in most
raiding guilds these days.

Counting alliances as single guilds, and using 75 as a critical mass to
progress in the current game, 50 per-raid-night, my server has 15 guilds
"competing" on the guild kills list (probably not the highest number among
servers):

http://quellious-collective.com/permafrost/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6680

Probably several others that raid as family guilds and thus aren't
"competing" as such.  They probably don't have much if any better equipment
than you though.

I just accounted for 750 people per-night for raiding, or 1,250 actual
active population likely to show up through the week.  The interesting thing
about raiders vs. non-raiders is that raiders are by nature easier to count
for those without better figures to work with.  I don't think you can show
1,250 non-raiders per week, only partially because I don't believe the
numbers shake out that way, the other part because you can't count them.  =)

You might be surprised at how many members of the EQ version of a lot of the
guilds that "moved" left behind, or who simply quit out of frustration
because they didn't like WoW from the start, or later because they realized
they didn't.  Not discounting how many didn't really care for EQ anymore and
WoW was exactly what they were looking for.  I'd say those guilds were lucky
to land with 50% of their EQ population.  On the other hand, as it wasn't a
problem restricted to higher end guilds, a lot of EQ guilds were lucky to
land with 50% of their population as well.

I think any "fix" to your problem with the game would do likewise, or at
least have a high risk of doing so.  Understand, I use enough DoN augs, have
single-group and raid rot equipped 2-box twinks, etc., that anything that
helps you would help me, I am arguing against some personal benefit here. 
EQ is so many magnitudes easier now than when I "grew up" that it isn't even
funny.  The gap in equipment is narrower comparatively than ever before, and
still comes out more challenging than all competitors.  I'd like to keep it
on that side of the line.

I think Sony is trying.  Look at how it has been argued in this thread. 
Raiders get great stuff faster.  DoN was the all encompassing answer for the
single grouper.  The added new instances are gravy.  They really thought it
would be enough to satisfy.  I would have thought so as well.  Even focus
effects were included, and hp augs that come far more quickly and as good as
the Uqua/Inktatu raiding level.  Though of course lazy raiders (and those
who hate grinding for the longer time required RS/GoD augs) can knock out a
couple dozen DoN and fill up on them as well.  =)  I do think it is the best
single-group content in a while, and OoW was pretty damn good.

For that there can be no solution.  The needs of the many outweigh the needs
of the one.  --Some pointy eared white rapper.

I can appreciate the plight.  But the bleeding edge has always been some
distance ahead of the rest.  It provides baselines for future expansions. 
If you were arguing to slow down mudflation...  I'm not sure I would agree
still, but that's a different discussion.  =)

But the best stuff back in the day, the Naggy and Vox loot, was done by
dozens of people working together from very early on.  Raiding really
started earlier than that.  I remember taking a multi-group raid on the
Efreeti in Sol B and to Lower Guk.  Raiding started *early* in the game as
people decided they could work together to all get a shot at better stuff
than they could with a single group.  And they found they enjoyed the
working together, both for toys and because it let them see more of the
game, some enjoyed the strategy while others enjoyed the scenery, and
everybody enjoys toys.
