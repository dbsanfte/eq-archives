It will go up faster if you put the 1HB weapon in your primary hand
because you'll get more swings in, but your overall damage will drop
considerably until you get your skill up.

IMHO, the best way for you to get your 1HB up is just put the your off
hand for the time being and get what skill ups you can that way.  In
the mean time see if you can't pick up a couple of really fast 1HB
weapons.  Blackjacks should be pretty cheap anymore.  Then, once you
get level 22, head over to the LoIO and start fear kiting (snare, cast
panic animal, hit on their back as the plod away) kitties until your
1HB skill catches up.

What do you mean?  The damage/delay ratio on the weapons or your the
amount of damage you're doing per swing?  If you're talking about
dam/del, they that is a fixed number dependant upon the weapon, if
you're talking about how much damage you're doing per swing, remember
that there is a damage cap on melee until you reach level 20.  I think
the max damage you can do per swing is 20 until level 20.
