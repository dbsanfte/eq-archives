    Our guild used a bard and three wizards. :-)

    Guess what mob the bard and three wizards warmed up on earlier in the
day. :-)

    The development team is apparently discussing a change to Manaburn: it
leaves a buff on the mob that can't be overwritten. So you'd only be able to
Manaburn once, then have to wait for the buff to wear off. We'll see if they
implement it.
