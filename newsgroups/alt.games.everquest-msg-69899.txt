He's a level 10 shaman, so he has SoW and Serpent Sight.  The Karanas
aren't a real problem with SoW if you keep your eyes open.

The top of Runnyeye also is no problem with SoW if you don't get lost.
Nothing on top (unless something has been trained) will beat down a
passing SoW'ed level 10 shaman fast enough to make the "just run
through and ignore anything that hits you" strategy fail.

The Gorge has things that could hurt a level 10 shaman pretty bad, but
they are all avoidable, and if you do get aggroed, SoW is your friend.
