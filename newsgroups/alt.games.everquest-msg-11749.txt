I was in Oasis yesterday and got maued by a zombie sage 3 times. I have
never seen him there and was wondering if this was a GM playing an NPC.
There was a discussion in /ooc afterwards if it was a GM event or a new
spawn.  The Concensus was a GM as he was putting on some crazy moves, nobody
could stay with him for long.  It was not until the high level characters
came in that they finally took him down.

So my question would be was this some bored GM just messing around, or was
this some kind of storyline event.  When he died, the only loot he dropped
was a FS quarterstaff.
