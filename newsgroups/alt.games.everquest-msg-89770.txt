> Well, the worst part of that is the four hour wait.

  That is my main objection to Verant CS in general.  It just takes too long to
get a response from Verant to a petition, and to get in contact with an actual
GM.  Too often my petitions have gone completely unanswered.

  Then perhaps better screening of Guides, or better training is in order.
Volunteers or not, they are the customer service backbone in game.  If they're
going to be relied upon so heavily for so much of the service/support workload,
they need to be reliable.

  Seems to me like either way you're going to piss off one group of players.
They might as well decide on who to piss off on the basis of who's right and
who's wrong.  If a GM is afraid to make a decision on that basis, well, that
sounds like a fundamental policy and management problem that needs to be
remedied.

  Well, if the determination was made to the GM's satisfaction that the "ubers"
did KS the mob, it seems to he could have taken the following steps:

  1) Take away the epic weapon and all other items gained from KSing the mob
(without rewarding them to the other group).

  2) Hand out the appropriate warnings, suspensions and bans.  Players with
level 50+ characters should know the rules regarding KSing and have no excuse
for their behavior.  If banning the whole lot of them is considered too heavy
handed, they could simply warn those who haven't been warned, temporarily
suspend those who have been warned for other offenses in the past, and
permanently ban those who have been temporarily suspended.

  3) It sounds like in this situation the mob in question was a triggered spawn?
The GM could replace the items that were used in triggering the mob to give the
person another shot at the mob.

  This sort of action can only be taken, however, if the GM is SURE the mob was
KSed.  Ideally, Guide testimony and circumstantial evidence SHOULD serve as fair
proof, but that may not be the case if there are too many incompetent,
untrustworthy or corrupt Guides.  That should be addressed if possible.

  It's this sort of situation why the cleric epic was changed, however.  Bad
game/quest design will result in these sorts of situations and they aren't all
going to be resolved to the satisfaction of the players involved.  Verant has
recognized that it's a problem and they've made an effort at fixing it.

  In my opinion, there just needs to be many more GMs.  I'd estimate they'd need
to double their GM staff to achieve what I'd view as satisfactory in game
service and response times.  There's also a lot of other little things they
could do to improve the situation.  Unfortunately it just seems to me that CS is
not a priority for Verant.  I guess from the perspective of a person running a
business, I can't blame them for that... if they're losing X number of people
per month because they're unhappy with Verant CS, but they gain or retain Y
number of subscribers per month by committing their resources in other areas,
and Y is greater than X, then why should they reallocate their resources to CS?
It just doesn't make business sense, and if it's bad for the business, maybe in
the long run it may end up being bad for the game.
