Take 3 songs you want to twist.  So you twist 
1 - 2 - 3 - 1 - 2 - 3 
right?

Well, here's my lazy man's way to twist.  I suspect this works with
most songs, but I noticed one day that Largos and Denon's Discord
didn't need to be hit every twist, they could each be skipped.  So, if
I put 2 of my normal twists at 1 and 2, then Largo's at 3, then
Denon's at 4, I might have a twist that looks like:

1 - 2 - 3 - 1 - 2 - 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 1 - 2 - 4 etc.

That is my official lazy bard's way to twist more than 3.  

Works with twisting 5 as well.  Sometimes I may toss in the mana song
along with song 2 and alternate them as well.  The bitch of the deal
is when you've been doing it for a while you start losing track of
which song is next!  :-)
