     I really couldn't tell which it was, but 
it was definitely odd.  I was wait for the boat
at the Freeport docks yesterday afternoon, 
along with a few others.  A guy comes up, and
asks if anyone is available to help him with
a few tasks.  I was bored, so I turned around
and started having what ended up being a long
conversation.  This guy, Mayn, is green to me
at 15 and /anon.  And he talks _exactly_ like
a quest NPC.  He sounds like he might have 
written most of the dialog we get from the 
various loquacious NPCs.  And he never breaks
character, not even for a second.  This,
added to warnings/announcements of "strange
happenings" the system wide messaging has 
been giving Drinal for the past two days, 
make me think that I might be talking to a
Verant shill.
   He tells me heartbreaking story.  He's a
craftsman, with a drinking and gambling problem.
He got robbed in the Jade, and wants to go
home to Qeynos but can't go through high hold
pass because he owes someone there alot of 
money.  And he thinks he might want to do
some fishing.  The boat came and went.  I
continued talking to him, trying to find
out what quest, if any, he was giving out.
He didn't want me to escort him to Qeynos
via the Rathe Mountains.  He didn't want
me get him a fishing pole.  He didn't want
any plat to pay off his debt.  Finally I
got him to tell me that he wanted me to
recover his stolen good from the vicinity
of the Jade (well, he called it the Emerald,
but said it was in the courtyard of the 
bank).  And he was very specific in what he
wanted.  A tarnished longsword, a few 
pieces of patchwork that he had made form
the skins of the cats he killed, and a 
large sewing kit that his grandmother had
given him.  
   Well, these things should be easy enough
to get.  I told him I would help.  Of course
I found nothing in the courtyard, but I was
able to get the things he asked for off of
vendors.  I had to sharpen a rusty longsword,
and only found two pieces of medium patchwork,
but I did get everything he asked for.  Cost
me perhaps 2 plat, mostly for the sewing kit.
    I bring these to him, and show him them
in trade.  I ask if these are his things, 
and he says they look like then.  So I give
them to him.  He thanks me profusely...and
that's it.  He asking how he can ever repay
me.  I tell him that his goodwill is enough
(because remember, he's roleplaying penniless).
He bows, waves good-bye, and leaves.  I go
back to he boat, to sister island to get 
my corpse.  When I'm there, he /tells that
he can repay me because he's getting alot
of bonechips.  I tell him thanks, but I have
more than I know what to do with.
   So.... was this a very creative beggar, 
or the worst quest that Verant has ever
come up with?  For what it's worth I don't
regret having done it... it was an interesting
way to spend an hour, and I had fun doing
it.  I figure I've either come to the 
attention of the events staff as a player
who is open to doing such GM quests, or
made friends with the best roleplayer I've
ever met, either of which I hold to be a 
good thing. 
   So has anyone else had something like 
this happen to them?
