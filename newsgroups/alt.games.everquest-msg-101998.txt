make sure you have latest directx also install it before the vid driver
i heard
and use the following for windows to more effeciently handle the memory
(per tweak3d.net) and it worked for me

In system.ini, add the following under the heading [386Enh]

LocalLoadHigh=1
(tells OS to load the local drivers into upper memory by default)

ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1
(if you are running win98 this setting will force the computer to use
the swap file in a "conservative" way.

add these under [vcache]

Minfilecache=xxxxx  
(this will set the min value to how much swap file in kb your system
will dedicate. it is recommended that you take 10% of your ram and
multiply that number by 1024 to convert to KB.

Maxfilecache=xxxxx
(this will set the max value to how much swap file in kb your system
will dedicate. it is recommended that you take 25% o f your ram and
multiply that by 1024 to convert to KB.

[note: some people prefer to set their min and max filecache to the same
value , so as to lessen the time the computer spends with the swap file
when the swap file is in use. I find that this works fine but personally
I like to have a bit of a gap btween min and max. putting a gap there
guarantees you will always have sufficient swap file space.

hope this helps , I did these and EQ tripled in graphic speed (=
