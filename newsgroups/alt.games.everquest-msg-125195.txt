	Did you not have an enchanter?  With the exception of Vah Shir only the
strongest spell or song counts.

	While the Bards in my guild are nice people, I have found that given half
a chance they will fill your entire buff space with junk.  The last time a
Cleric couldn't land a celestial on me it was because of Bard songs.  I
clicked off Jolting Blades -- meaning I started drawing more agro -- and
another song instantly took its place.

	Bards aren't the only culprits either -- I've had all three priest classes
throw every spell in their book on me without asking first.  And don't get me
started on Paladins with Divine Strength/Brell's.  The difference is that I
gave up trying to tell them that we only have space for 15 buffs total and
that's got to include celestials and a space for a mob's debuff/DOT.  When
someone casts a spell on me I don't want I just click it off without saying
anything.  I can't do that with Bard songs; they just come back six seconds
later whether I want them to or not.

	I will blame others when it is THEIR FAULT.  I do not cast nonessential
spells on myself and I don't allow others to either.  But I can't do anything
about the Bards.
