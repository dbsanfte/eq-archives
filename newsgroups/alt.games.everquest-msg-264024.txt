Name another druidic ability that people will pay money for. I hear people
begging for kei and virtue, and sometimes a shaman's buffs, but shouting "59
druid buffing for donations" is a waste of time. It's not just me that
equates a druid's value to being able to port, it's everyone with a bit of
money to spend. Heck, wizards still get some calls for ports, and beastlord
kitty crack is often regarded as the icing on the kei cake, but the market
places zero value on a druid's abilities.

Druid's are not needed. If the entire class disappeared, all current
encounters would still proceed without a hitch. They might be used in some
groups when a cleric is not available but i can't think of any encounter for
years I've been in where the group (or raid) has said "if we didn't have a
druid, we would have been stuffed." I can think of heaps of situations where
enchanters, clerics, shamans, paladins, warriors, rogues and wizards were
vital... ok paladins really peaked a year or so ago, with certain aa they
could wade through undead like a hot knife through butter. Monks, druids,
necros, bards, i was going to say rangers but there were a couple of
situations where ranger track was essential...but the rest were not
essential, merely useful if nothing better was about. Ranger ranged combat
might be useful in upper level situations I haven't played in but the 50's
and below presented only a few situations where a ranger would be
specifically targetted as desirable.

Can you tell me of a situation where a group cannot succeed without a druid?
No? Now think of a situation where a group can't succeed without a cleric or
a tank or a rogue or a wizard, it's pretty easy.
