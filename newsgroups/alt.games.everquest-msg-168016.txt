I was meant to add, Rinna is Priests of Life faction and not Knights of
Thunder, there isn't a lot of difference as what hurts one normally hurts
the other but, if you are not KoS to the Paladins in Qeynos then you could
hunt the bandits in WK for sashes and hand them to Chesgard, this would be
much faster way to gain faction than the Gnoll Tooth approach, but only any
use if you are not KoS.
