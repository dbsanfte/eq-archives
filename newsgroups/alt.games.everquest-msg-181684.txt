As far as I could gather the exp was split to groups and then shared by
group members. I was 7th man on a raid group and was getting reasonable exp
whereas the other group had nothing.

e.g

Mob dead, worth 100 exp points. Split to the groups means I got 50 points
and they got 5- points divided by 6.

Its all shit anyway. Raid is good for the purpose for which it was made.
