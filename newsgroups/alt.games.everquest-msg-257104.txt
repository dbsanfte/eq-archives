Heheh, well, back in those halcyon days when I could actually run 3 
instances of EQW on this computer, my best possible group was 65 enc, 64 
dru, 62 rogue.  So no, the rogue was not a practical choice for a tank, 
but she was the best option I had of a bad batch. :)  Still, she tanked 
Fellspine and lived.

Actually, that's probably a big part of it.  We've been joint raiding a 
lot with another guild lately, and I don't think our raidleaders have a 
whole lot of confidence in the other guild's skills.  Not dramatically so, 
but perhaps enough for them to choose 'ranged fight' for conservative 
safety reasons.  Honestly, they seem pretty good, though.  Go go Valiant 
Crusaders!
