There are some level 65's on my server now.  The thing they all seem to have
in common is that they went to Plane of Valor.  One person who was keeping
track of things via /who said that one of them went from 62 yesterday to 65
today, all in PoV.

So, what's going on there?  Is there a botch like there was when Luclin was
released?  (The Luclin botch was there was a zone where you could easily
find 50 or 60 blues to pull and AoE, and there were enough that you could
basically continously do this, limited only by your mana regen rate).
