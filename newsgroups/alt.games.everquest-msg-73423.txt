I dont know that I would say it is twinking (and I am anti-twink) but
I can tell you that since level 30ish range I have had a pair of
Cobalt Gauntlets in the bank along with an Idol of the Thorned waiting
for me to reach what I deem an appropriate level for my using them.

I do not simply agree with being ultra powerful, to the point of
having items that I shouldnt be using.    Decrease the Risk and you
trivialize the reward.  

My Cobalt Gaunts have an effect that is usable at 45.  To me, 10
levels below that (current level) is not appropriate to be wearing.
When I hit about 42 or 43 I will start wearing them I suspect, but in
that range I will be able to start camping some of the places that
Cobalt drops as well.
