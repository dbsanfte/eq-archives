Probably a really stupid question, but here it is:

My wife complains about very bad lag when playing her character, however
when I play on that PC with my character I don't seem to have near the
problems.  Her eq_log file had gotten up to around 6+ MB and the character I
played (not near as much on that PC) had a relatively small log file.  I
went ahead and created an archive folder and moved her log file to see if it
helps.  I haven't had a chance to test her character since last nights move,
but I thought I would ask:  Could a very busy area/zone (Crushbone group) be
overwhelming the CPU by all the ascii file writes to the log file?  Is EQ
keeping the whole file in memory, or just appending to the file?  I guess
I'll find out tonight if it helps any.  I have done all the other obvious
things to speed her up (turned off dynamic lights, spell effects, sky,
etc....).  To make matters worse, we are trying to run Luclin on this box.
I have less than the recommended new character models activated.

For what it's worth, she is running on a Compaq 500mhz AMD machine with 384
MB RAM, Geforce 2 MX 400 (PCI Bus, 64 MB RAM) by PNY.

Thanks,  Jeff
