I'd say don't worry about it.  I stopped melee with mobs around the level
you are at now.  As a pure caster, you'll find that, more and more as you
progress through the levels, the mobs can hit a maxed defense caster as
easily as they would hit a level 1.  Dodge skill is the one possible
exception, but even it won't keep you alive long with mobs doubling (or
quadding!) for over -- sometimes well over -- 10% of your total hit points
each hit.

In the end, your contribution to the group by getting to full mana will
dwarf the contribution you could make in any sort of melee.
