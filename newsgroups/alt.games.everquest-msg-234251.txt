Hook up with a Necro and/or Druid in the GY. The xp there is amazing.
Like others have said there are a few suits that see invis. Easiest
thing to do is con them. I always keep Exodus up if I need a quick
exit, but have never died running to the back areas as long as I con
the suits on the way, and stay a short distance away. Also to start I
believe you maybe apprehensive to some of them if you have never
killed them - at least I was to start (Karana - Druid). Of course
killing like 3 will get you to KoS fast hehe.
