John,

There are a TON of newbie armor quests since the patch with some decent
stats on them.  I did them for my monk.  There are some broken ones, and
some ones with apoparently improper ingredients, but they work for the most
part.  Check with a few guild masters.  I'm sure you'll find a use for that
skull.

Bryce
