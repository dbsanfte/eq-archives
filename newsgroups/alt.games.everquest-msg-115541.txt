You know, the funniest part about what our once loothandlers did is
that they ran off with a bunch of their friends and formed a new
guild, and their charter states that they will not allow greedy
members... (a number of thoughts come to mind)

Natureskin and bladecoat.

I finally maxed defense not too long ago. I worked hard to get to 184,
then stopped worrying and the next 10 points took forever. The last 6
came pretty rapidly after I started soloing in Chardok - if I get
smacked around on a raid, it usually didn't last long enough to give
me a chance at a defense raise.

Magelo doesn't agree with my computer, so I haven't made a profile and
never will (when I look at pages, I get some boxes and maybe some
pictures if I have the patience to let it load a little longer, and
maybe some stats written on top of the pictures, but I can't check the
names of the items in slots. So, I've stopped trying to look at other
people's pages.)

Plat ruby veil
Othmir fur cap
Shimmering slime necklace
Earring of woven bark
Earring of twisted leaves
5th Coldain shawl
Hierophant cloak
Belt of the holy wanderer
Gloves of the earthcrafter

Plat jasper ring (dizok begirding, but it's currently on alt in case I
get another while I am still solo exp grinding in Chardok.)
Woven grass bracer
Vermiculated bracer
Nathsar vambraces
Elysian tunic
Black chitin leggings (yes, I said black chitin leggings)
Coldain skin boots
Seal of Thoridain

Sarnak battle shield

I have gatorscale leggings, a charred guardian shield and a hollowed
pixie rib earring I put on when I tradeskill to get my wis to 252, and
I can't be bothered listing my messy bag of resist gear :)


Annoyed that our phone line broke just after 4 pm so I can't play
