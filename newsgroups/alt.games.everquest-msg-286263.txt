As a retired 60 bard on Firiona Vie, I recently tried rolling up a new
bard on Stromm and checking out the /melody feature. When singing 4
songs, I am able to keep them all up for the most part, but one does
occasionally drop. The auto-restart is a godsend, though.

Short of twisting in a long-term buff, I could never get more than 4 to
stay up at a time. I'm attributing this to network latency rather than
any sort of deficiency in my own skills, of course. ;)

Hmm. Hadn't considered that. One would think it simple enough for them 
to tweak it so that only "You have missed a note..." type occurances 
trigger a re-try. Then again, this *is* the bard class, after all, where 
no class modifications - no matter how minor - can be veiwed as safe. :P

That's very interesting. I hadn't considered that approach. I guess I 
can finally forego SoW potions and rely, instead, on good ol' Song of 
Travel. :)

An old familiar mechanism with which I doubt too many bard vets would 
find fault. After all this time, double-tapping to initiate another song 
or twist just seems the natural action.

Here is where my experience has been different. While /melody was 
running - and in the middle of a fight - I drank a potion and noticed 
that, while all spell gems were grayed out, no more songs were being 
sung, and they eventually dropped from my song buffs window, though I 
could not "stop" the melody or start anything else manually. I was just 
stuck in a singing-but-not-really-singing state. I had to zone to 
correct it. I have not tried any clickies. They could be more reliable 
in that respect, as they aren't necessarily tied to normal spell/song 
recast timers and such.

I've never been a fan of the Drakkin. They just don't look like they 
belong in EQ. Plus, among other things, the face spikes look glued on or 
superimposed, with no protrusion marks or shading of any sort on the 
skin around them, and the animations are just plain amateurish and 
silly. The way they short-step when turning in place always reminds me 
of the way the magician earth pet runs - waaay too many steps involved. 
Lastly, are they supposed to look so emaciated and emo?
