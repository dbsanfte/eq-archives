Thank you for the detailed information. :)

I'm currently playing on Cazic-Thule, but I've been wanting to try out a PVP
type server.  It sounds like the one that I'd fit in with the most would be
Tallon Zek.   Sounds like a lot of fun. :)

A quick question though... it sounds like the best type of character to have
on a PVP server would either be a Necro or a Druid for survival.

I love Rogues (that's what I stuck with on Cazic), would being a Rogue on a
PVP-Teams server be incredibly difficult?  Or on that kind of server would
you more than likely always be in a group?

Thanks,
Johnny
