No.

I'm talking about when the puller comes back with a mob in tow and everything
about a wizard's soloing experience tells him he should start dropping his
biggest nukes as soon as the mob gets within range. I'm talking about the
beastlord whose soloing-informed strategy of how to infallibly steal and
hold aggro is that he merely has to be standing within the mob's melee
range. I'm talking about the soloing shadowknight's experiences that
offtanking is just the lazy man's way of saying "/pet get lost". I'm talking
about the soloing cleric's experience that Divine Aura is only useful for
running to the zone line. I'm talking about the druids who wake up the
mezzed mobs with their root+damage spells because that's what they *always*
do with adds when soloing.

I'm talking about all the things that soloists learn that are true and/or
useful for soloing that they have to *unlearn* when grouping. I'm talking
about all the strategies that are useful for grouping that you just can't
practice without a group or partner.

I'm not trying to paint the picture that soloists are morons. Far from
it. In fact, I think soloing is an excellent incentive for stretching one's
skills and learning new tricks. But much of the knowledge and abilities
that make a pc group-friendly are *not* ones you will pick up soloing.
