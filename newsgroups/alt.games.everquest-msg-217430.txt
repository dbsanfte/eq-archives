Ethereals have already come down dramtically.  On Lanys any ethereal
spell sells for <500 pp - often under 100.  And now, spectrals are dropping
throught he floor.  Spells that went for 12-15k a couple of months ago
go for 1-3k now.

At the same time, 50-60 spells have also dropped in price with the
advent of LoY research.

I would start grouping in PoV if I were you, most people there will let you
have ethereal drops because they already have all of their's and they
aren't worth anything in the Bazaar.  One day I got 6 ethereals for my alt
BL I'm leveling up, because the would have rotted otherwise.
