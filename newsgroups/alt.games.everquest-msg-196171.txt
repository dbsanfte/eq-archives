  I read something once that makes since, it's not the warriors job to keep
taunt, it's the groups job to keep taunt on the warrior. =)    I have a 60
warrior and it is a pain keeping agro at times. It does seem like others
love to see if they can take it from me. I have gotten the satisfaction of
watching them drop dead after taking it also. haha
