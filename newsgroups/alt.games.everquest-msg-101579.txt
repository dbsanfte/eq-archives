  Wonderful for you.  I'd rather not do with several keystrokes and a click,
what I could do with just a click.  I'd do the extra keystrokes if it meant
I was safeguarding against some sort of horrible catastrophe... having a
person maybe see a line of text or two pop up is far from I'd consider a
catastrophe.

  But you still haven't established how you've come up with the notion that
inspecting a person is "rude."  The truth is, most reasons a persons would
have for inspecting you are completely innocent.  Yeah, you'll miss the RARE
idiot who comes up to you and spam-inspects you, but in my opinion it's more
rude to go looking for excuses to get upset with people, than it is to
express curiosity about someone's equipment, or accidentally click them.

  Well, on the server I play on, everyone is /rp, so /who doesn't work...
something I would agree is pretty stupid, but it comes with the territory.
Regardless, I don't see anything rude with trying to figure out what class a
person is.  There's nothing rude about inspecting, /who, or asking.

  I'm one of those weird sorts of people too.  I'm not the weird sort of
person who thinks I've been done some sort of wrong when somebody inspects
my character in a virtual world without asking first.

  If it upsets you, those bad vibes are likely to spread.  When you deny
people buffs when they inspect you, do you tell them why?  And if so, it
implies you think you've done them some sort of wrong, something you think
they should feel guilty about... just like accusing someone of KSing,
training you, ninja looting, being insulting or having done any other sort
of wrong... when all they've done is fulfilled their curiosity about your
gear and "inflicted" you with a message that you didn't even have to see.
You say for roleplay reasons you prefer to leave on the flag that indicates
you're a paladin... what if I, for roleplay reasons, prefer to take a closer
look at whose standing before me to determine things about them (which is
precisely the sort of thing I think Verant is trying to encourage on FV,
between forced /rp and the little text box that you could fill up with a
more detailed description of your character's appearance, or a short
backstory, ect.)?
