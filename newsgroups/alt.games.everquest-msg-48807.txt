That could happen but highly doubt it, I tested DAoC since Beta 2 and it's a
awesome game.  Too me it's a bit like EQ but a hell of a lot better, I've
talked to a handful of EQ players thats tested DAoC that said they were
cancling their EQ accounts for DAoC.
I'm not cancling my account but I haven't played it for a long, long time,
but will give EQ: SoL a try.
