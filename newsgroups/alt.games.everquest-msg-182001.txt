I'm looking at getting my self a new GFX card and this month I've got an
extra bit of cash lying around so I was looking at

Novatech GeForce4 Ti4200 128MB 8XAGP Graphics Card TV Out
found here http://www.novatech.co.uk/novatech/specpage.html?NOV-GF42T8

It seems a good deal at only ï¿½111.62 ( about $167.43) but what I really
wanted to know is does anyone know of any compatability problems I might
encounter with EQ ? while I enjoy the odd FPS my main love is EQ and RTS
neither of which really needs a card this powerful, so I would be well
bummed if I installed the card and found EQ runs like a bag of nails with
it.

One of my other machine has a Savage Pro Gfx card and it bites big time when
it comes to running EQ =(

Thanks for any help you can offer, I couldnt find anything on Sonys site.
