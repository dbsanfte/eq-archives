Tailored backpacks, as non-combinable ten slot containers, have long
been a valued item for bank storage, entirely apart from the recent
addition of a weight reducing component. That meant that you had a
potentially huge market for the bags.

Now, however, the market is drastically reduced - they're only more
useful than the tailoring kits as a carried item. There's no
compelling reason for someone to purchase a whole bank full of them.

Just as some classes are harder to play, I figure that some trade
skills are harder to raise. I don't really mind that (until I've
burned a few hours looking for a particular skin - then I get a little
cross, I admit).
