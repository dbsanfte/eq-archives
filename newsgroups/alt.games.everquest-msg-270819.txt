That's the reason I figured they'd be hurting, along with the Eurpoean
folks.  Lower starting populations would be affected more dramatically.  FV
may or may not fall into that category.  I had a character on FV, but it
didn't get played much.

The bean counters will deep-six PlanteSide and SWG long before EQLive gets
the axe, IMO.  Server mergers have a larger chance of happening, but I might
start with allowing free transfers before invoking all of the logistics that
will have to be considered to successfully merge two servers.  But that's
just me ... I readily admit to being conservative in my management style.
