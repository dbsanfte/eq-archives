Currently you can scribe at least the level 10 Craftsman and Outfitter
books. However, it is said this is a bug and will probably be
eventually fixed, wiping the recipes from anyone's lists who scribed
them when they shouldn't have been able to.

My question is why not just sell off the raw maple? Second tier raw
materials tend to go fairly quickly.
