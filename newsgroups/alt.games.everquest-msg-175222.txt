Assuming like most necros that you can't get into PoP groups (if you're
not in a guild that hunts there regularly), then I'd say go to the
darkpaw gnoll caves in JPF. Go to the big rooms where the boss gnoll
spawns. (Barducks Darkpaw, I believe). Those things give *great* xp, and
are rediculously easy to kill, plus have an aggro range of about five
inches. You can do it all day long and grind out some serious xp. Hell,
even though 2/3 of the warriors and all the casters are light blue at
58, you can *still* rack up some xp there.
