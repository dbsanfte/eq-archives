There are some differences, some spells do less damage, probably a few other
things.  The biggest difference, is you are facing a real person as an
opponent.  As far as dying, you do have to loot (assuming you are over level
9), you, mostly, do not lose xp.  Exceptions can occur if you die to a DoT,
used to be to a pet too I think, but that may be fixed.  You only have 10
minutes or something along those lines to get a rez.  Anyone can fight
anyone else in a PvP area, otherwise, on the blue servers, you can only
fight if both parties consent to a duel.
