You'll get a disclaimer every time you log on saying that nothing is for
sure there. There is no guarantee of any customer service (e.g. GMs to
answer your petitions should you bother to make any) and often there are
not. The server drops all the time, often without notice, sometimes with
a warning if they have time, so downtime can be a lot greater. Often
(and I mean *often*) the server drop will result in a rollback. (The EQ
"clock" is rolled back to some earlier state.) This can be only a few
minutes, or several hours. I have logged back on after an outage to find
that the last half a level of xp I got and all the loot I obtained,
faction, whatever, are gone. Not a damned thing you can do about it
either. Suck it up and move on. There is the *chance* of a character
wipe or item wipe. However, there's only been one full item wipe (all
characters lose everything in their banks and on their characters
inventories) in the history of the game, and never a total character
wipe (where the characters are just deleted) that wasn't later restored,
at least for the characters over some low level, like ten.

You can have eight characters, just like on production servers.
