To be honest, most of the people who do the stuff like AoW really
don't lose much sleep over the loot.  Usually it's a passing comment
(seriously the swords off AoW are idiotic), but beyond that it's
largely a footnote and not given much thought.

However, let's take a look at what did drop in comparison to what is
available in the game especially considering the mob's abilities.

Avatar of War.  Quad hits for 1150+, chain flurries, has something
like 800khps.  Basically a mob that is *UNTANKABLE* by any player in
the game (hint:  if Verant changes the way pet aggro works in this
game, AoW becomes unkillable again).  

He drops four items.
One good mask, one very good ring, and two absolute shit swords (no,
seriously, look at the stats on those swords, compare it with a primal
that drops off a FAR easier dragon in ST and you'll understand).

I'm sorry, but that loot table is messed up.  For the amount of effort
that you need to put in (40 mins of non-stop fighting with 80+ people
using bind rush AND relying on the current pet aggro "bug"...jesus),
it needs to be significantly better, on par with the stuff coming out
of ToV off MUCH easier mobs.

On the other hand, the second kill dropped items which are in my mind
reasonable:  Monk only leggings with great stats and AC 60.  *THAT* is
the kind of jaw dropping loot that AoW should be loading.
