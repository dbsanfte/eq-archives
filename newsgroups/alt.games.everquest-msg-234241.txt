Playing devils advocate for a sec.  Some people may just want to try it
out before making a commitment to paying ~53(40 for evolution and 13
mo.) for a game they haven't tried.  Granted, they could try out the
classic pack with Antonica, Fay, and Odus...but that's not really the
same game, is it?

Of course, the caveat is: the free EQ servers are nothing like
eqlive(usually, some have made strides to emulate the environment quite
well, imo).
