While doodling around EQLive site, I went to look at the Befallen

Oh! I almost forgot... 

While working with the Swords & Sorcery Studios folks, we made some

with Sir Ariam in Befallen and get yourself a ride. 


anyone done this... whats it all about?

Befallen, is one zone I never go to since my wait on that dang mummy
to spawn for the paw of opolla....
