    That's why I'm all for solo LDoN adventures. I think there should be a
path for those people.

    The raiders typically attempt content above that the non-raiders
attempt, because of the (to them) poor rewards of content anyone can access.
The gear may be better, but so is the mean average difficulty of the content
being attempted.

    I deliberately tried to mimic the original poster's style, hoping he'd
see how biased and unfair his generalizations were when the degrading
comments were applied to him.

    I don't even argue for ten times the time commitment. I argue for the
same number of man-hours as the raids take to get equivalent rewards,
including time to gear up in precursor zones. I just don't think that your
typical soloist is willing to put in the amount of time that represents,
though - it would be far easier to just apply to a raiding guild and try to
get in there. There's a big difference between fifty people taking four
hours to get four drops, and one person taking 200 hours to get four drops,
two of which he likely cannot use.
