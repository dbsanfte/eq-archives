Will differ on this method.  Here is what I suggest.

1.  Download driver cleaner 3 here:
http://www.driverheaven.net/cleaner/

2.  Download DX9 from the Microsoft site.

3.  Go to Add/Remove programs and delete your ATI drivers.

4.  Adjust your screen size to 640 x 480.

5.  Reboot in safe mode

6.  Do not accept the devices that Windows finds (your graphics card).

7.  Remove any registry entries for ATI using Driver Cleaner 3.

8.  Re-install DX9.

9.  Reboot.

10.  Install the latest catalyst drivers the www.ati.com

You do not say what cards you are using because some will have a hard
time with EQ under DX9.

I believe your problem is actually a corrupt DX9 installation but have
given you the best method for solving either driver or DX9 problems.

You can use the DX9 utility (dxdiag) from the run line under your start
menu to test whether DX9 is the problem.
