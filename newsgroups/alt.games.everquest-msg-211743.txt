I and 90% of the people I've grouped with since hitting 65 must be
horribly inexperienced then. It must be my inexperience and naivete
that causes me to enjoy spending so much less mana healing someone who
can chain stun to the point that he takes almost no damage. I'm sure
that the shamans and enchanters I group with only enjoy being able to
slow and tash on the pull because they're total n00bs.

Thank you for taking the scales from my eyes.
