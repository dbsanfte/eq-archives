I did the math once years ago on this.  The key element, oddly, is
meditation.  At around 20, you lose more mana in lost meditation time by
chain casting inner fire instead of using a less efficient Healing spell
and sitting down.  Of course if you have a horse, then I suppose IF
would be efficient far longer, if you can stand chain clicking that many
times in a row!

Personally I've already broken away into using Lesser Healing, 30 hp per
click instead of half that, and no worrying about whether your target
has someone else's HP buff on em already.   But I know, secretly, that
I'm giving up some efficiency for laziness.

Well that would be the kind of thing I'm talking about, you only have to
worry about one resist, and apparantly your unbuffed resist is high
enough to provide a base but not high enough to make buffing pointless;
the "sweet spot".  Same thing happens with AC, AC tends to be too low
for a boost to matter, or too high for a boost to matter, but there's a
range for each mob where an AC buff does count for something.

So its pull with slow, channel root, back up, DOT, channel root, back
up, DOT, channel root, back up, heal yourself?

Compare with druid: Pull with snare, root, DOT DOT sit and wait for root
to break normally, and when and if it does you reroot (cause mob is
coming at you too slowly to actually get to you).  Manna efficiency of
not having to reroot and heal seems to have the edge, although I haven't
compared druid DOT to shaman DOT for efficiency

Ah,well thats good news.  I was getting about 75% break grouped with a
level 10-13 cleric, but if breaking drops off as I level up then it
won't be nearly so irritating.

Heh, tell it to my bard, short duration charm rocks!  The idea isn't
like chanter charm, to get a pet, buff it up, and keep it alive for
hours; you use bard charm to get two mobs to fight each other, then
break charm before your pet dies and kill both (if your pet is winning
you needn't drop charm), getting two kills for little more effort than
one kill.  Shaman might have some trouble with this, lacking Snare,
since you often end up with two angry mobs moving your way.  Wouldn't
want to slow them, since that would defeat the purpose.  You could,
though, root the target so you only have to deal with recharming your
former pet or sticking a root to him or something for the kill.

Well, I'm not at all sure it would work out, but its something to think
about.

Not as many as my Iksar I'll wager... but why should we care?  I can't
think of many places I'll need to go that I couldn't do just as well by
taking a POP book to Cabalis or the Moon (or POK itself)  Am I missing
something?

Think DOT and heal in fight is better than melee and heal between
fights?  I don't have a real feel yet for how effective the DOTs are, my
sense of mob HP is all screwy and my data on DOT damage is pretty
small.  Lets see, 10 damage DD plus 8 per tic for... 7 tics?  So 66
damage?  Doesn't seem like much, I'm hitting for up to 14, figure
average 7 twice per tic, thats more damage than the DOT right there at
no mana cost.  This will fall away as I level up, with lagging melee
skills (4 per level instead of 5 for melee's) and better DOTs, I guess.

WIth a horse your plan would look a lot better, since melee would cost
med time but clicking IF wouldn't

I'm also always a bit shy about DOTTing in a group for fear of creating
an unmezable mob, I suppose with no chanter/bard/necro in group I can
relax about that part!

Forssake
