I'd like some advice from warriors that know, please.  I now have bash and
slam, but slam does not show on the skill list so I guess that means it
can't be raised.  Does that mean one should always be used and forget about
the other?  Or is it situational as to which should be used and if so, then
what situations would make the difference and why?

2nd question -- does dex help melee skillups?  Thought I had heard that but
not sure.  Seems like my 1hs and 1hb go up very slow compared to attack and
even compared to defense, but that may be because they are still too low.  I
haven't even started on piercing and the others.  Should I?
