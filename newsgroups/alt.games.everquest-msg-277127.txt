Lol.

Sure.

I fully admit my example of a functional free market is an unachievable 
ideal...

...given that a if such a market existed and was "free" it would  
*inevitably* cease to be free due to forces inherent in free market 
economics.

Free market capitalism doesn't work.

That said, the hypothetical 100 stations owning a single channel is a 
free market. It won't be for long but it is free *now*.
