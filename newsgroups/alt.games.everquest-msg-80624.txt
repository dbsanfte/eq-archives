Bard's get Solon's Song of the Sirens (first charm song) at 27 and
Crission's Pixie Strike (first single target mez song) at 28.  They
also get an AE mez at 15, but it's absolutely useless past level 30.
A level 30 bard should be able to do crowd-control, song-wise, but if
he hasn't played a crowd-control character before, it may be rather
dicey.  If he knows he's doing crowd-control, but not that familiar
wtih it, you may want to start out camping the spires in SK so he can
get used to mezzing and charming, then head into Splitpaw to practice
with a couple more mobs.  Learn your limits, push 'em, but don't be
afraid to run like schoolgirls.

Bah, no reason to need a shrink in Guk anymore.  It's not like there
are 20 people sitting at the zone waiting for groups now.
