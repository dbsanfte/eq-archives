Actually, I did reference them in my post. And I am aware of their 
pioneering reseach. My point was that Apple brought it to personal 
computer users first, whereas Microsoft did so much later and in my 
opinion, Microsoft has been following in Apple's footsteps ever since.

It was Apple who first applied the fruits of that research to practical 
use that benefited people. I don't think there was any theft involved 
but if you have some reference to XEROX going after Apple for stealing 
their work, that would certainly make for some interesting reading that 
I would like to see.
