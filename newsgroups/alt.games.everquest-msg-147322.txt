That's where the whole web thing breaks down.  There isn't a good 
business model for people who have really neat web sites.

Too dull and no one appreciates your hard work.
Too cool and you can't pay for the web site.

I really appreciate the effort that Alla and many others go to; 
however, that doesn't mean that I'm willing to pay for the content.

Fun, but I can live with out it.
