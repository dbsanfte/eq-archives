*sigh*

Are you Dennis' alt by any chance? Magic, Archery, Swords-n-Sorcery all
have their real-life counterparts. The tanks are the grunts, the healers
are the medics and support personnel. The casters? Heavy artillery (or
tactical air support, depends on how you want to frame it)

The type of warfare is different. The setting is different, the
mouse-clicks and even the *gasp* graphics are different, but hey - I got a
news flash for you: The strategy and tactics of warfare never
change. Attack by surprise, use overwhelming numbers, combined-arms
tactics (gee there's a thought), intelligence and espionage, they're all
still relevant.

So don't enter the frontier area alone? Do you enter PoF alone? Do you
raid Hate by yourself?

NO. You assemble your force, you plan out your strategy, and you
-raid-. If you're stupid enough to enter the frontier alone looking for a
"fair fight" you're dumber than your posts indicate.
