We're getting into the "is.. is not" level of argument here.  Blue exp
may not change anything for you.  For me, knowing that taking a break
is going to make it easier to level keeps me from doing the "i'm going
to level if I have to stay up all night" thing.  Which improves my
overall outlook on life. 

So for some folks it's a big win, for others there's no impact, which
sounds like a pretty good feature to me.
