I'd rather pet owners were allowed to figure out if they're competent for 
themselves, mainly.  We only seem to have one person who could use a 
little help with that, and that seems like pretty good odds.

We don't really -have- a rule.  We just have people who shout things in 
/rsay that sound like a good idea to most of the folks after half the 
people have already summoned pets.  And then half the people who'd 
summoned them kill them, the other half whine in the private channels 
for their class (like me), and then we wipe because our DPS was too low 
and the clerics ran out of mana.  We've never been too big on having too 
many official 'rules', other than our shiny new DKP system, and boy, did 
people put up a squall over that.

A post on our messageboard recently kinda sums up why we don't tend to 
add too many rules to the bylaws.  A person from an allied guild was 
proposing that we create a joint messageboard section so our guilds could, 
like, talk more, y'know?  And she said she'd go poll her guild about the 
idea and get right back to us, to which one of our officers replied:

Nearly made me spit coffee all over my keyboard, that did.  So true. :)

Yea...  I don't think we've ever TLed someone out of a raid.  Everybody is 
somebody's brother or best friend.  Being teammates is probably more 
important to us than whether we beat the stuffing out of mob X today, and 
poor so-and-so who just screwed up and boned us probably already feels bad 
enough.

That doesn't mean we wouldn't try and explain what he's doing wrong, of 
course.  But generally, we try to give each other decent advice, rather 
than creating rules and meteing out punishment for infractions.

That other way sounds so... un-fun.
