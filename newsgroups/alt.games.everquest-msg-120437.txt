Another nasty trick, which should get the same treatment:

1. Cast an attack spell or fling an arrow/throwing weapon at
a Luclin spire Scion.  The Scions hit for hellacious damage,
but don't budge from their spot, so you're safe as long
as you keep your distance.  They won't chase you.

2.  Wait for someone to approach the spire.  Go up to them
and ask them if they could kindly buff or heal you or
whatever.

3.  Watch as they continue on their way to walk up to
the Scion for a portal gem.  *WHAM*, down they go,
smitten by the Scion.

Why it works:  Step #2 spreads your aggro onto the
poor victim, who then has no indication that he
has been added to the Scion's hate list.
