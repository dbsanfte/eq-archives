No AC boost at all, a loss of 2ac overall infact.
OP is wearing AC12 (Ry'gorr) Gloves and already has a spiderfur belt. The
FBSS/CC gaunts also gives a loss of 2AC but less haste and less saves (from
the SCHW)
No arguements on the SCHW (AC, Stats and Saves leave no contest) but I'd
also look for a decent deal on a Chitinous Belt, in the Bazaar (seen as low
as 600...800 is a good price imo) AC13 +5 Str, Sta, Wis +10vs Poison, this
will leave him 1ac up on what he has now + haste.
