Backspace
Hieght Filter Off
Scroll till the scale shows you landmarks you recognize.

You are on the map as a little moving crosshairs, or better, if your Sense Heading
is high enough, an arrow pointing in the direction you are facing.

In dungeon situations, its best to turn that height filter back on, and just
increase the hieght parameters to pick up stuff thats near your level.

You can click a button on the bottom left to pull up the cartography tools, which
will allow you to (among other things) mark your current location; I use this set
of features solely to "add label" to mark important locations that arent already on
there.

EQatlas maps are generally better constructed and show more details and are
prettier, but the sheer ease of using the on screen map with your current location
and direction of travel on it is for me an astonishing upgrade.

No more traversing zones by following the walls.  No more careful loc, move, loc,
turn, move, loc for navigation and finding specific spots.  I used EQEAtlas for
years, and still will, but now only as a supplement in most places.
