I've seen Windowblinds in action, and I think it's probably worth
getting for the Aqua skin alone, but after shedding about 100 sterling
for XP (Not happily... I want Bill Gates's millions, but I sure don't
want his karma) I'm going to cut back a bit on shareware at least for
the next month or so. I know there is a freeware version, but it's a bit
half-assed (like, it doesn't skin scrollbars). Thanks for the tip,
though... Windowblinds really is a very good proposition for those of us
who think that the designers at Microsoft ought to be pushed from the
top of Beachy Head.
