Instead of "spaghetti code," I'd call it "FrankenCode."  It's the difference
between the city layout of NYC and Phoenix.  As NYC grew, it became a mess,
regarless of the skill of the architects.  Phoenix was better planned, but
some messiness still creeps in.  And Tuscon... well we just avoid that
festering hole.
