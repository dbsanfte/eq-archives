I believe you; the truth is, that I didn't play all that much wow, but that
was the impression I got from it.

these 'un-soloable' quests: around what lv do they start coming across?

in my view eq2's mentality of 'pushing towards grouping' right from the
start pays off as a more 'grouping-friendly-player-base'. admittedly this is
a moot point when guilds come into play.. there are guilds in wow, right?
