I missed the bit about installing it as an upgrade.  I thought everyone knew
that you NEVER do that with a microsoft product, particularly Windoze.  I
did make the mistake of installing Win95 originally as an upgrade to 3.1.
Since then, I have never done anything but a clean windows install for any
version of windows.
