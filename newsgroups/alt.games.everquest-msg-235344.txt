Too true. Oddly I don't really object to the carrots they dangled with
each expansion. I'm bothered by the pricing; in Canada its cheaper to
buy the box then pre-order... so the minute an expanion is announced
I'm subjected to months of nag screens for a product I'm happy to
purchase *when it arrives* and not 1 second before.

In hindsight of my disgust with the "champions of norrath" campaign,
im surprised they didn't go all the way and give access to  'special
exclusive eq1 zone or usefull eq1 aa'  or even bundle it with GoD and
crank it up another 20 bucks.
