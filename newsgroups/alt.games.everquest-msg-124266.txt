Which is what makes it such a great dungeon!  Get your group together to
head there and most every time you will find that you can actually hunt
there.  Most dungeons that allow pick up groups to form at zone in tend
to be over camped, meaning that you may have to try a few zones before 
you find one your group can play in on any given night.  HS usually has
at least one wing or the basement open, in fact I don't ever recall
having to leave cause of it being too full.  Of course the fact that it
is one of those places you just shouldn't go without an enchanter makes
it all the better as far as I'm concerned cause we don't have one <EG>.
