When I first got CH I often didn't use it because at that point tanks didn't
have enough points to be worth it.  If you are grouped with tanks <42 then
you could probably drop it.  Been awhile since I was 42 so not sure if I got
that right, but you could consider it.  Especially if you have an improved
healing 2 item.
