I am using two IBM 7200rpm 60gig drives striped raid 0.  Having a
114gig C: drive is nice, but I noticed not much improvement in zoning
over my old laptop.  Zoning does not look to be very drive-intensive,
judging by the little light on the front of the box.  Other file load
times are much, much faster.  Overall, IMO worth the extra bucks.
