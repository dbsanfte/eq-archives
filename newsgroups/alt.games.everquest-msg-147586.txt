I keep extra armor, weapons, food and drink, batwings, sow potions, and one of
those "locate corpse" rods in my bank account.  
Everyone's already listed the necessities I carry around....
Question?  re payment - alot of people won't accept plat, which is cool, but
maybe they'd take components they need:  peridots go to who?  best gems to give
to what classes?  coffins?
