Thus, my joke.

Yes, Celano's warrior doesn't have much use for KEI, nor does my bard, nor do
monks or rogues for that matter.  Other than that just about any class will
benefit enourmously from KEI.  Necessary, no, but just as  paying 100pp for a 10
does SOW isn't necessary, it helps a LOT and if you are clever about it, 100pp
spent on a KEI will more than pay for itself.
