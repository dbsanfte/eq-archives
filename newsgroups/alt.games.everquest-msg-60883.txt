Another problem with DL is that it has unbelievably poor loot; bronze armor
and weapons are the good drops off level 40 mobs!

The nearest bind point for a ranger to LGuk is Grobb.  Sure, he can't
bank there, but the guards don't see invis, just mem camo and walk
out of the place and back to LGuk in a minutes time.  Nearest merchant
is I think in SRo, isn't the orc in the NW corner (Ro temple faction
quest guy) a merchant?

COM is a great place for a ranger, as it has dungeon loot and exp, but
is an outdoor zone as far as spell list goes.  On the other hand, a ranger
that solo's in close quarters has a fool for a partner... get a cleric or
a tank (hmm, paladin might be ideal) and rangers really rock.

I solo'd next to a ranger in COM for a half hour, we each killed three
mobs.  When I finally talked him into a partnership, we killed
30 in the next half hour.  Thats 6 times the exp, 6 times the loot,
and we both felt safer and had less annoying down time to boot.
