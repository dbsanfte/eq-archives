My 53 Monk didn't die till he was 25 for the first time, and maybe 2 or 3
times after that till he hit 47. After 47 with him going on raids he has
made up for it big time for a rough guess he now dies 5-10 or more per raid
depending on where we are at. Pulling was so much easier in his younger
levels.
