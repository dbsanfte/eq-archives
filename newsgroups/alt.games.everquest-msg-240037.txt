Unfortunately, that's generally what Lurkerr does.  He doesn't play EQ
anymore, or if he does it's on some random server we're unaware of.  He
likes to post random one liners or a general "Hmmm..." in threads
looking to itch under people's skins so he can bump his post count up. 
He may very well deny that fact here and anywhere else, but he may not
know that posting in this place doesn't seem to increase his count at
all.  All in all you just need to remember not to feed the trolls. =/

He's just that bad that he was striped of his post count at one point,
which caused him to literally explode into tears (hey, he even sent me
an IM).  Just to describe to you what kind of person Lurkerr really is.
