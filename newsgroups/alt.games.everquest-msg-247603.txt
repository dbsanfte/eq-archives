Yup.. they don't need your affirmation to kill mobs in game.

Not at all.. if they're jumping mobs you've engaged i have as much of
a problem with them as i do with you. But you didn't claim they had,
just that you did and were proud of it. Enough so that you posted a
rant in the NG complete with the subject 'Payback'

Not the same thing. You just want the right to carpet bomb areas until
your drop happens. Sorry.. but the game isn't setup to give you that
right. It is a social game and people can come into the area where you
are at and kill mobs, regardless of having to ask you first. They
can't kill mobs you've engaged, but they have all the option in the
world to engage open mobs.

Irrelevant.

>And had they have asked

They certainly were not required to, allthough i would agree it would
have been considerate of them.

Its an open island.. i would suggest i would beat you there first.. i
certainly wouldn't leave it up for any length of time. I might not
like the fact if you beat me there.. but that's the game and I only
would have been pissed if you had attacked after I had engaged. But
your issue was not with them killing a rare spawn.. they were killing
commons and not asking you first. You chose to KS to grief them.

This is not only acceptable behavior.. its the way EQ has worked for 5
years. It usually doesn't become a major issue except at very high
level mobs at endgame. But.. if you find yourself in a race to the AC
spawn(we were both in OOT when it popped), and lose because I engaged
first.. would you show good sportsmanship and back down? Or would you
look to KS the mob and do whatever you could to foil me. I would back
down.. would you?
