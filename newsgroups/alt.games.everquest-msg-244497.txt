Not positive, but I think the OP may be looking at a coincidence here. 
Was just chatting on AIM with a friend who said that in addition to 
world servers being down for patching today, the login server was borked 
as well for a bit. In theory, though, he/she should be able to hit the 
login server and see the normal server as "down" and pick one of the 
Euros that's up.
