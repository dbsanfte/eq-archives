  We are all fit to "judge" EQ, first of all.  The game isn't perfect and
without criticism (preferably constructive) the game would not improve in
such a way that we as players would appreciated as much.

  Second, I personally agree with the first poster... 256 mb MINIMUM
requirements?  As he noted, very few, if any games REQUIRE that much memory.
I've seen screenshots for a lot of RPGs and FPSs which look a LOT nicer than
the Luclin screenshots and they don't require 256 mb of memory as a minimum.
And we all know that running at bare minimum is NEVER a good idea.  My
system meets and beats Verant's "recommended" requirements for Kunark, and I
still get poor framerates in some CLASSIC EQ zones, with my clipping plane
turned all the way down, particle effects at low and the resolution at
640x480.  Considering that 512 mb is the RECOMMENDED requirement for Luclin,
I wouldn't expect comfortable performance with a "mere" 256 mb of RAM, but
we'll have to see.  Maybe Verant is making their system requirements a
little more realistic this time around.

  Also... everybody says how "cheap" it is to upgrade memory, but my
experience is that upgrading memory can be a dicey proposition.  Not
everybody is comfortable opening up their computer, especially considering
the fact that it often will void their warranty with their PC manufacturer.
And with some computers, like my sister's HP, I swear the manufacturers go
out of their way to make upgrading memory as much a pain in the ass as
possible.  Compound this with the fact that even if you're savvy enough to
figure out what sort of memory you need, mixing memory from different
manufacturers can result in stability problems, even if you do everything
else right.  And on top of that, some motherboards have
stability/performance problems if you populate all of the RAM slots.  Also,
some people with older motherboards may not be able to upgrade beyond 256
mb, at least not without flashing their BIOS... something you don't want a
non-computer savvy person doing, since you can essentially ruin your
motherboard.

  So it's not quite as simple, cheap and easy as you and some others
suggest.
