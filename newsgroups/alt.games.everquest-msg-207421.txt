Thanks for the math lesson and the answers.  I knew the lv20 wouldn't get
exp with a lv40, it just made the math easier for me.

And since we're on a roll here, what happens if you throw a pet or two into
the equation?  If I'm soloing, I understand I get more exp if I do more
damage than the pet (not sure of the formula) but what happens in a group?

As a side note, I'm only interested in the under lv50 math if that makes any
of this easier.
