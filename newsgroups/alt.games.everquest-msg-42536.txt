When I started my Gnome chanter, I made friends with the Druid who was
killing the poor watchman.  She kept buffing the Hell out of me ( wolf-form,
etc ) because I made her laugh.  I killed the normal rats and stuff for
levels 1-3 ( made very easy with the bufs ), then went on to killing the
kobolds at the easy camp ( right north of the druid ring ).  At level 5, I
moved on to GFay ( ie. StupidHell(tm) ) and killed Cents for exp and sold
the belts for 1pp each.  Many people turn in the belts for EXP to Canloe (?)
in Kaladim, so that's an option.

You can progress up to about 12 if you want in SF - check out the windmills.
You can also head into Crushbone when you feel you are ready.  Watch out at
the windmills, because just about everything that runs when it is about to
die will head straight for the mills.  There's a watchman in the area and
the guy in the Mill who will come out and KS your kill.  Nice to have around
for protection, but will piss you off when you don't want him to help.
