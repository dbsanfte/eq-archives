Corpse recovery from diving into the hole generally consists
of "find a high level necro, buy a coffin, have him zone in
the regular entrance, and summon."  (coffin cost 175pp,
necro high enough level to do it, priceless)

Alternate possibilities would be to

1) launch an enormous raid on the hole and fight your
way to the body (inconveiently, you are naked or
wearing your alternate equipment)

2) get a character who isn't KOS, like say a dwarven
paladin, or perhaps a bard who knows what his 12th
song is for, to go in and drag.  Not sure that -everything-
in there is on the one faction, though.

3) get someone with stealth skills to do likewise...
will invis do the job?  Will Hide and Sneak, rogue style?

4) write off your equipment as a total loss

This last is what the hundreds of sub tenth evil erudite
newbies who go down the hole out of curiousity are
stuck with, which is what is so odd about this literal
death trap sitting right at a newbie zone.  We are trained
to think of death as a temporary inconvenience, where
we need to go loot our bodies, but here is a completely
different story.

PS: If you like to BASE, try starting a cleric.  At
level one you can purchase the Divine Aura spell,
which will allow you 18 seconds of total invulnerability,
so you can survive almost any jump in the game, the
Hole being a notable exception.  I used to jump out
of kelethin pre-tenth just to avoid all that running around
trying to find a bank, and at 51st, I still use DA to
get to the city in CC: Jump off the ledge and train the
dozen or so orcs that I pick up at the bottom to the
coldain.

As you've already observed, hitting water means taking
no damage, one of the best things about EW is jumping
off the dragon bridge... 10Khp if you happen to hit
land, btw.
