That's a nice thought except for the fact that one has choice which removes 
the excitement you spoke of before. Sure, you could impose a CR on yourself 
but why? The idea was that death could have substantial consequences and the 
idea of dying someplace tough to get to was scary, etc. So exploring could 
be scary. A bad pull could be scary. Now it is not and never again will be 
in the same way. I would agree though that there is no reason to not enjoy 
the old places and I often do myself over the newer ones. I rolled a new 
High Elf recently who is going to do the newbie armor quests in Greater 
Faydark for the fun of it. Not the ones that came later in PoK but the ones 
you began in Felwithe upon arriving the first time which I chose over 
dropping into the tutorial. I will jump in there long enough to get him the 
charm and then leave after he has it for some real fun.

I wish they would create a classic server that only has EQ, Kunark and 
Velious myself. I'd love to see that happen and with a commitment that it 
gets no expansions at all for at least 2 years and perhaps one annually 
thereafter. No unlocking them, no mad rush by raiding guilds to unlock 
progressive raid content, etc. Just old world for a good long time and a 
really slow annual expansion pace. I'd love that. Of course, no transfers 
allowed in either direction. No trial accounts allowed on this server.

That seems a reasonable request. I wonder if enough people would like that 
to justify the server's existence. Maybe it would even be profitable if they 
actually marketed it. I'd think many older players might like another run in 
the world as they knew it versus what it has become. This is hardly a novel 
idea and surely it must have been brought up many times on the official 
forums to no avail. I guess I am just having a little pipedream here... /cry
