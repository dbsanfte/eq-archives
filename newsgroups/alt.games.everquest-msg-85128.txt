My ranger is beginning to creep through his 30's now and I've decided
to go with Kael faction because they seem to have better armor quests
and such for melee types.  No problem there, but from what I've heard,
there are two different factions for Kael.  Now, I'd like to make sure
I'm not KOS anywhere in the city, so what do I need to get all the
requisite factions up in Kael?  Or will just killing dwarves get it
done?
