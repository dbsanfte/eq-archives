	It went live on Legends in the last patch.  The baking recipes did not
leak over.

	Unfortunately some of them do not currently work on Legends, either.  No
one has gotten the noodle recipe to work (DNC), so we can't try the pastas,
either.  And the Panther Liver Pate needed for the extended Qeynos Badge of
Honor quest won't work (though I think that's a case of the livers not
dropping...not sure.)
