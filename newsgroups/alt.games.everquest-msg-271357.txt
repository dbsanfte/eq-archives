City of Heroes is the most fun MMORPG I've played, and I've played them
all!
It is not short lived, well depends on how you play.  I started in
beta, then 6 months after it went live I was still loving and enjoying
it, which hasn't ever happened to me in any other MMORPG (I played EQ1
for a couple of years, but mostly because there was nothing else out
there, wasn't really enjoying it).
It's a different MMORPG to what you're used to, very simple yet highly
fun.  No inventory, so no 'camping a mob for 6 hours for uber loot'.
Missions are instanced, so no more 'Camp check!'.   Many different
power combinations so it has high replayability value.  When I left it
(temporarily) I had about 10 different heroes between levels 20 and 33
(just 2 over 30), so imagining a new power combination and playing it
is a big part of the fun (and powers are different enough so playing a
new combination is almost like playing a new game)
Does it play the same at 30 than at 10?  Hell no!  Just as you have
more powers to use, so do the enemies.
Now, I wouldn't recommend CoH to the soloer type of player.  Not
because you can't, in fact you can solo all the way to max level and in
some cases, faster than those who group, but the game is 100000% more
fun when playing in groups.
