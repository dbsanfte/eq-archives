This will change :) There will come a point when you are killing level 50+
monsters that drop items that can only be considered junk for their level.
Ok, so it's worth maybe 150pp at auction but frankly most people can't be
bothered with taking the time to offload it. Then they think "hmm this would
be good for my level 5 <insert class>" and that's how you start on the
slippery slope to twinkdom :)

This tends to be MUCH more of a problem in newbie zones. Although it will
still break out in high-level zones at times like a Sunday afternoon when
all the weekend-campers are online. Or when school's out.....
Sad fact is that there is almost NO roleplaying done in EQ any more. It may
be worth you trying Sulon Zek.
