Melduhr and Aruvqan are discussing::

I love my ornate bracer, FT1 is nice, I am sort of trying to 
collect FT items. I am thinking about getting a second one=) I 
have all weight resist bags except for an empty slot I use for 
summoned stuff like toolboxes, or spits/tradeskill stuff

They dont want clerics to be useful in a fight other than healing 
I think...

Just did 2 of the 5 scout bits for the BL quest with a friend of 
mine, the wolf and the wisp, was great fun. Spider wasnt up or we 
would have gotten him too=)

ROFL I like to make sure Kael is empty, make sure to have a fresh 
sow and levitation ... starting from the first gateway at the 
bottom of the entrance area, announce a train and hit divine aura 
and run for wakening lands =) I usually make it =)
