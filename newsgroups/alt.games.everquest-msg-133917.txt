Arguably yes.  Although not explicitly a "special right", affirmative
action/quotas did in fact result in unequal treatment.  I understand
the reasoning behind them, and the "big picture" view that this would
eventually level the playing field.  By and large I think the effort
had a negative impact, for all its good intentions.

What EQ seems to think though as that any sort of law against
discrimination is a "special right".  I seriously doubt he has ever
read the text of any law, and has yet to show he is basing his opinion
on anything other than a knee-jerk reaction to his pet "axis of evil"-
anything or anyone he can label as PC.
