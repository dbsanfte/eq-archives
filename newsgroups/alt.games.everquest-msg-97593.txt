hehehe truly.

I meleed up to about 30 porcupining away. Then the mobs hit
so hard they were crunching on every hit. No amount of AC
or damage shield can take that.

I was even proud to get all my weapons skills maxed out. Now I
look back and see what a waste of time it was. Even with max
weapons skills, wolfform, strength, and firefist here is how the
battles go:

*whiff*
*whiff*
*whiff*
*whiff*
You crush A Mature Rockhopper for 6 points of damage.
*whiff*
*whiff*
*whiff*
*whiff*
You crush A Mature Rockhopper for 3 points of damage.
You crush A Mature Rockhopper for 1 points of damage.
*whiff*
*whiff*
*whiff*
*whiff*
*whiff*
*whiff*
You crush A Mature Rockhopper for 21 points of damage.
*whiff*
*whiff*
*whiff*
*whiff*
*whiff*
*whiff*
you say 'Ah fuck it!'
You begin casting Starfire.
A Mature Rockhopper  was hit by non-melee for 612 points of damage.
you have slain A Mature Rockhopper!

It took me a long time to convert but if you are a druid and
you think you can melee at the higher levels trust me YOU CAN'T!
