Hello!

After playing many hours in Everquest, I am finally a level 7 ranger. It
takes forever it seems, unlike other games [Diablo, etc]. Although I am not
complaining, even doing quests doesn't seem to get much reward.

Is it just that in depth? If so, I have mucho respecto for the higher level
players; it must take months!?
