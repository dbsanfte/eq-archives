A few days ago the testbuff madness on the Test server (it bumps you
to L25 and gives you decent equipment) boiled over again in Highkeep,
where most the testbuffed people naturally seem to go (its been a
festering sore on Test since /testbuff was put in). 

Someone got a log of what happened after a few too many petitions and
complaints about abuse. Remember, Test has no CS staff, only one
senior guide and a whole wack of GMs responsible for testing stuff.
They still see the petitions, though. :-)

(taken from another board...)

" I was in Highkeep today when the GMs received one too many
complaints from the zone again. I'll let the ZoneEmotes speak for
themselves...

[Wed Jun 25 17:19:38 2003] Everyone in Highkeep is now PvP Flagged
[Wed Jun 25 17:19:50 2003] So if you aren't going to play nice, kill
each other.
[Wed Jun 25 17:26:31 2003] You may petition after you leave the zone
to have your PvP flag removed.
[Wed Jun 25 17:29:16 2003] Player says out of character, 'GM's are
retarded?'
[Wed Jun 25 17:29:44 2003] Player has been slain by the gods.
[Wed Jun 25 17:35:49 2003] I'll unpkill everyone... If I have to come
back here I will not be so nice.
[Wed Jun 25 17:38:46 2003] does anyone still have a red name?

....

Don't bug Test server GMs! :-)
