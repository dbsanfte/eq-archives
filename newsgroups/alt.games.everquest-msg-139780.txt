What I don't understand is that he was perfectly fine with buying the
DVD in the first place.  He saw it, wanted it, bought it, and got what
he expected.  THEN he's pissed because he finds out a better version
is coming out in three months, and it will probably cost more too.  He
wanted the Lord of the Rings on DVD, he got LotR on Dvd.  Nuff said. 
I'd have told him this at the counter.  But unfortunately...with the
assholes that alot of clerks have to deal with it's usually easier to
break policy and give them their money back so you can go onto the
next asshole.

Isn't it wonderful how people will agree to rules and restrictions at
the time of purchase, but then when they run into them later the rules
are suddenly unfair and they deserve 'special' treatment because they
have molded reality into a different shape and suddenly that $25 DVD
that they happily plunked the cash down for 2 days ago is not worth it
anymore. If this guy is going to freak out everytime he finds out that
an improved version of something is coming out soon he'll have a tough
life (pssst...don't tell him his computer is already obselete).
