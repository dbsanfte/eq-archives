	Too difficult to accomplish for a pick-up group; everyone has to be used
to working together.

	Even then I don't like doing it.  You never know when you're going to get
trained by some asshole; if you're playing too close to the edge when that
happens you're going to trip.

	Besides, I usually end up doing the pulling, and I happen to like getting
the EP for my party's kills.
