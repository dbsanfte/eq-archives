If it is true that post level 50, a cleric can do nothing but heal
and buff, that still means that for 90% of the clerics out there,
the class is -not- restricted to this sort of action.

I've said a hundred times that when I make general
statements, I don't mean it to apply only to some
very specific small range.

Yes, your level 5 cleric should not be a stun machine,
the spell has a high mana cost for the effect you get
from it.  Yes, your level 55 cleric should not be a stun
machine, your prey may be completely immune and
just annoyed by your casting.

But somewhere between say 14 and 49, for many many
situations, stun is your best best friend.  Forget healing,
stun like a madman.

Given that it is functional for many situations for the
vast majority of people in the class, I don't think its
unfair to say that it -is- a good part of the range
of capability for the class in general.

If I have a comment that should be restricted to
the 50+ game, I'll note it as such... only I won't,
because as you point out, its an area I know little
about.  I know that, you know that.  Take it
as read.

Depends on the group, depends on the room... generally you
don't need a cleric, most situations most of the game.  You
don't need a warrior, a monk, a wizard, frankly for most
situations, most of the game, there is no specific class you
-must- have and cannot do without.

Yes, exactly.  Much of the game, you'll find your cleric in
situations where he has other options than strictly heal and
buff.  If (and I say if, mind you) you are finding yourself
bored by being a cleric, then you are doing it wrong... not
because you suck at being a healer, but because you suck
at finding fun.  Seek out situations like that LGuk King
group you spoke of there...  Adding a cleric to a group
that needed only light healing if any at all, you instead get
a great nuker, or stunner, or melee damage dealer, or
(if you can get the tanks to listen to your ardent pleas
to back up) root based crowd controller.

If you do any one job to the exclusion of all else, and
seek out situations where this is needed, well, I have
no real problem with that.  But don't come whining that
the class is boring.  Heck, I don't care for driving
at high speed making continuous lefts, but there are
NASCAR fans out there...
