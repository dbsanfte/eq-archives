Aye... but the FV book is basically the shortcut to DL.. which still
has quite a few people in it. At the levels where FV would be
beneficial.. there is usually better elsewhere. The spiders at the
exit to that cave are f'ing retarded too.

Aye.. but you can still get groups in PC at the camps. If soloing or
being PL'd you usually are at the other end of PC.

I still like the dynamic ZEM idea.. Let the average population dictate
how much of a ZEM it has. The longer it goes unused.. the higher it
goes. The more it becomes used... the lower it gets. It would really
do a lot to spread out the population as people try to go after the
higher ZEM and as more people learn of it it averages out.. and so on.
