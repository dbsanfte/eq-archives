Level 60's don't suck up all that much more XP than people of your own
level would.  In a group with 3 other level 53's, you would get 25% of
the XP.  In a group with 3 level 60's, you'd get 53/(53+3*60), or
22.7%.  In a group fighting level 50 mobs, the group would have to
kill about 20 more mobs to get you through level 53 than it would if
everyone was your level (out of about 220 total kills for the group).
However, since a group with you and three level 60's can take harder
mobs than you and 3 level 53's, you would probably actually level
*faster* finding a group full of 60's that will take you.

Under the old XP system, you would have only got about 11% of the XP
when grouped with three level 60's, and so would have been better off
grouping with people of your own level.
