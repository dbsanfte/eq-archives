Chris,
The two points aren't ethically equivalent.  SoW and other speed
enhancing options are options of the game, specifically included to
allow characters to do this.

The exploits, often having to do with pathing errors, were
specifically designed to find ways in which an NPC could be defeated
outside of the rules of gameplay.   

You can ask yourself some fairly simple questions to determine whether
a method you've learned of is an exploit or a feature.

1) Is the reward proportional to the risk?
2) Does the method restrict or obstruct normal play?
3) Does the method allow the player to defeat an NPC mob that the
player could not otherwise defeat?

Countering these, any of the above can be cancelled -if- the player
was successful solely due to a feature of the game that works as
designed.  For example, a Level 1 newbie who gets mega-buffed by a
level 60 for powerleveling isn't a cheat or an exploit.  It might be
distasteful to some, but it's within the bounds and designs of the
game.

That's why I encourage you to think of proportionality, and not
fallacy equivalentism.

Regards,
Bill
