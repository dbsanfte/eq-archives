Weird.  You know necro's can rez using a spell, the spell requires a 
reagent, which in turn is created by casting another spell with an 
emerald equipped.  That causes the target to die, convert the emerald 
into an essence emerald.  They are sold in the bazaar, but necro's are 
perfectly capable of making them as well, mostly from toons who are 
going to be deleted.

My necro has about 40 EE's which cost him no money what-so-ever.

So he can rez, himself, his party members, or anyone he fancies.

And since he can invis, invis to undead, FD, harmshield, succor etc. 
he's perfect for dragging corpses into hard to get locations and rezzing 
in-situ.
