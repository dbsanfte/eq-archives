And I assume you think Clinton was not dangerous.  The man who was
elected president when he commited historical acts of treason.
The man who gave (or sold) nuclear secrets to China.
The man who put China on the most favored trading nation list.

Talk about dangerous, I think Clinton did more damage to our country
in 8 years than anyone in the last century.
