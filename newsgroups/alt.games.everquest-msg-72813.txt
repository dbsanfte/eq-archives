It's call "the group bug", and it's been around forever.
It generally happens when someone in the group exits the game
(either on purpose, by accident via going linkdead) while someone
else in the group is zoning.  The game can't update the group
list for the person zoning, so it ends up with a confused idea
about who's grouped with whom (or not).

The only known way to fix it is to camp out of the game
(to the character select screen is far enough) and then
come back in.

I've encountered this bug, oh, several hundred times now.
