Im a little confused cuz you call yourself a druid once in this post as
well.. but assuming you were on your necro... heres my opinion.

I think the folks you chose to group with that day are effing idiots. as a
necro you dont have the option of STANDING THERE while a RANGER gets agro
off of you. altho .. you coulda feigned I guess.

as a druid it doesnt change much.. at 54 you'd have .. what? maybe 600 more
hp over a necro on avg. I woulda kited it too till I could root.
