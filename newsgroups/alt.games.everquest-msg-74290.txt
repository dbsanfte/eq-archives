Yup yup, I had that very same Rathe !Kanthuk Ogerbane eat my note.  Had the
funky hair (looks like batwings growing from his head) and all.  I
petitioned, and was told "all quests are working properly."  I'd rather have
been told "yeah, we're working on that, don't know when it will be up" than
a blatant lie like that.

That is a pain of a run, since Robbie Whateverhisnameis is a 24 hr spawn,
fortunatley in a safe area.  Still, I'm kind of glad I got my ghoulbane when
I did, since I would be pretty irritated if I was trying now.  The problem
is, my guild leader is heading into the levels where he can go for his Epic.
Since the ghoulbane is a required piece for the Firey Defender (IIRC,
ghoulbane, Firey Avenger, and Mirugal's robe and head), and he doesn't have
one, I'll probably wind up giving him mine.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
