It depends.  For some mobs, you want them maxxed out.  For others, 200 
maybe be plenty high.  It also depends on how much is being given up for 
higher resists.  Often people will have gear to swap in when appropriate 
to raise specific resists, or all resists, for specific encounters.  That 
is a lot less true now than it used to be however.
