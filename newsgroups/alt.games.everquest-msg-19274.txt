The gypsies in Oasis will sell to you.. not all of them, but the woman with
her back to the lake will.

When you get to Velious (if you have the expansion), you'll be happily
non-KOS with the dwarves in Thurgadin, and you can bank in Crystal Caverns.
I was *so* happy to be able to bank away from Cabilis. Then I did the red
wine quest in Neriak, and can bank there. I'm not going to bother with
Freeport.. too much d*mn work.
