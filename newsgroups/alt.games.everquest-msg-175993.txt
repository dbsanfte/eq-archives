It's not always clear, sometimes the dialog requires *specific* questions
like:

"What about [spells]" vs. "I want to know about [spells]", etc.  Try if a

Unless you can consistantly shoot (dark blue+) mobs it will be behind your
other skills.  Until you get a good bow, you will mainly use it to pull
rather than a main source of damage, and even then you'll need a way to
slow, snare, or root the mob to shoot it without it whacking you.

You may be slightly moving or slipping so rotate a bit when you cast to help
reduce this effect.  Seems to work for me, but I still get interuppts.
