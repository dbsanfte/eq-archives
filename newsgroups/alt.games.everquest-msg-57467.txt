Hmm... I went to casters realm to get the address of the warrior disicpline
list for you, but the site appears to be down at the moment.   When it comes
back up, you should poke around at eq.castersrealm.com  and see if you can
locate it.

All disciplines take a text command to begin them, which can be put into a
macro.

Let me see what I can do with this at the moment.   (A note about recharge
times.  I am giving the base time at the level where you get it.  Recharge
times are decreased by 1 minute per level that you have the skill- For
example, the level 54 discipline has a recharge time of 1 hour when you are
54, and a recharge time of 54 minutes at 60.)

Resistant - Level 30.   Raises all resistances by 1, increasing as you level
to 10 at level 50.  (not sure what it is at 60... probably 15.)  Not very
useful.  By the time you are of a level where resists become important, you
have much better disciplines.   Lasts about a minute?  and has a recharge time
of 1 hour.

Fearless - Level 40.   Makes you immune to fear for 10 seconds.  Recharge time
of 1 hour or 30 minutes.   Completely useless.  You'd be better off going with
resistant, if this is your only other choice.

Evasive - Level 52.  Makes monsters miss you more often.  The disadvantage is
that you will not do as much melee damage.   Duration 3 minutes.   Recharge
time, 15 mintues.   This is the first good warrior discipline.   It will help
if you are getting hit by nasty things, and need to survive long enough to be
healed.   The lower melee damage means that your group has to work harder to
keep the targets on you.

Charge - Level 53.  All hits land for 10 seconds.  Recharge time of 30
mintues.    A nice discipline, but not very good in the grand scheme of
things, when you consider that against blues, 60% of your hits would have
landed anyways... and thats an awful long time to not have a discipline
available.

Mightystrike - Level 54. All hits will be critical hits / crippling blows for
10 seconds.   Recharge time of 1 hour.   This discipline is really fun to use.
(note, this is different from being useful)   It's flashy, but the extra
damage from critical hits over 10 seconds isn't really all that much, and once
again, you lose your defensive disciplines for a long long time...  Use this
one when you want to impress your friends, or you are certain that you won't
be needing to tank anything hard.

Defensive - Level 55.  All hits on you will do less damage.  You will also do
less damage to your target.  Lasts 3 mintues.  Recharge time 15 mintues.  This
is currently the best warrior discipline.   It is what allows you to tank the
ubermobs, and can save you (and your group) during a bad pull or a ton of
other circumstances.  Much better than evasive.

Furious - Level 56.  You will automaticly riposte all hits for 9 seconds.
Recharge time 1 hour.   This is the "Oh shit" discipline... for when the
cleric says "Complete Heal Dearic, 10 second cast time" as you have a single
bubble of life left and three Sarnaks beating on you.   Use sparingly, that
hour is a long time... but don't be afraid to use it as a last resort.  (My
last time I hit this button, it activated as I finished zoning to my bind
point : P)

(I'm now starting into level 57, and the 57 discipline doesn't seem that
useful to me compared to the others, so I haven't tested it or the ones after
it, but I can give opinions on them)

Precise - Level 57.  The opposite of evasive.  3 minute duration, 30 minute
recharge.   You will land a greater percentage of your hits, but you will be
hit more often in melee combat if something is swinging at you.  (remember,
you're a damage taker much more often than you need to be a damage producer)

Fellstrike - Level 58.  All hits will do increased base damage for 10 seconds.
1 hour recharge time (I think)  This is another crowdpleaser.  My friend has
gotten well over 1000 point hits when crippling blow went off (randomly) while
using it.  Same cautions as Mightystrike.

Fortitude - Level 59.  The warrior cannot be hit in melee combat for 8
seconds.  Recharge time 1 hour.   This one just kind of makes me scratch my
head.   The level 56 discipline also does not allow you to be hit in melee,
plus you hit them back every time they swing at you, plus it lasts a second
longer.

Aggressive - Level 60.  Opposite of defensive.  Increased melee damage for 3
mintues, during which you will be hit harder if something hits you.  Recharge
time of 15 mintues.   This is a good discipline when you need melee damage and
you are not the main tank.
