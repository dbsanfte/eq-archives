No, not in EQ2.   A high "shield factor" on a newbie shield
doesn't make it something other than a newbie shield.
Items are all level-limited -- both to a minimum level (it'd be
red) and a maximum level (when it turns grey.)   An item
reaches it's maximum effectiveness when it's white (when
your skill equals the mastery skill of the item.)   It works
best against mobs that level (when it's white to you) or
lower.

So you can have a *great* leather-wrapped buckler
that mobs like badgers can't get past very well.   But
it'd be like tissue paper against a hill giant...
