at 17 I would say keep auctioning.  The ogre in Najena is
supposed to drop large bronze, but it is a rare or uncommon
drop.  As a barbarian you are lucky in that you can wear
either large or medium sized armor.  I have heard rumors of
medium bronze dropping in HHK but I have never fought
there.  Jazzmanian Devil might be able to answer this one, i
know he spent alot of time there.  I have never heard of
bronze dropping in Mistmoore, but if it does, it would be
small most likely.  on almost all servers EC and G'fay seem
to be the two biggest auction zones.
