They also still dont seem to get why people go to certain zones and why they
avoid others.  You have to wonder at that...why not just ask the players?
They also seem to be missing the fact that the content is lacking on the
high end, not the low end.  You are never gonna run into zone
crowding/unable to find a place to hunt problems, except maybe on the new
server, at level 40 to 50.

See above.  Their revamps have sucked lately, if you ask me.  VP was
horrible.  Zone is still a pain in the ass, loot blows for the people who'd
go there.  So what is the point?  Hate is also a let down.

Still dont see why PoP solo xp has to be nerfed for group xp to be
increased.  Group xp has been underwhelming in general since I started
playing my Necromancer, so now 3 years later they are gonna change it...in
part by making solo xp worse.  That is unfair to soloers and not needed.

This is a good change, but its really not going to matter much.  You need to
be killing level 60+ mobs at 65 to get the really sweet xp, thats not going
to change with this.  Will add a little xp to some farming zones, thats
about it.

This is a great change.

This is a bad change.  PoP from the start should have had more zones open,
but this isnt the answer.  55+ is too low for tier 2 planes.  Who in the
hell would want a 55 in their PoV cave group?  Or CoD group?  Stupid.  A lot
of players are stuck, for the moment, just outside of the Elementals.  This
change makes their game experience comparatively worse than before by
flooding some zones with idiots.  I guess I should be happy Tactics is still
a flagged zone.

This is cool, but who knows if it will be accurate or worthwhile.  Will
mostly help me when I am playing someone else for a flag.

This is very cool.  Very, very cool.

See #9.  Great change.

I like this a lot too.  Hopefully the /log feedback they get from DoT
casters will show them that without DoT 'crits' and meaningful damage
increasing DoT focus items, DoTs are way, way behind Nukes in terms of
utility.

This is a mixed bag.  Great for new players, maybe sucky for tradeskillers
and vendor farming will be less productive when people start hoarding more
than they already do trying to gouge PCs in the bazaar.
