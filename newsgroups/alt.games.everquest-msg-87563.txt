OK I'm a little confused about this subject.  I read that the only place
that a non-magic character or cross magic/melee char can get a bind is in a
city.  But just recently I was bound near the East Karana zone in Highpass
( it worked just fine, I had the opportunity to test it)  I am a rogue with
not a magical bone in my body.

So what are the rules here?  What is considered a city?  Maybe any zone with
a city entrance?  Are MOB cities like Crushbone and Blackburrow considered
cities for this purpose?

Thanks
