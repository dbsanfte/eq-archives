Ahh, thanks for that.  Oddly, I didn't have those hotkeyed, foolish given 
how often I use her as a tank. :)

Hmm, we definitely did RZ script TZ as ranged the other night.  Whether 
that was a bright idea, I cannot say, not being an officer and all. :)

We also did Sol Ro as ranged, since apparently dispelling his DS would 
have been too mind-bendingly difficult.  And I think either Reparm or 
Druav got called as ranged.

I don't remember anything Carprin having been ranged, but that's been a 
while.  Fennin, yeah, ranged.

It sounds like maybe our guild uses ranged significantly more than 
necessary... so maybe all you disaffected rangers should transfer to AyRo 
and join Prism. :)
