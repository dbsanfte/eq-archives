Seems like the insurance would be *very* expensive if the case is against a
corporation because the lawyers they throw in could be as expensive as they
care to get.  Doesn't that have the effect of causing "significant
restraint" on filing against a corporation *regardless* of whether the
corporation is guilty or not?  I can see that there should be a penalty
against frivolous lawsuits, but I just dont see that simply saying you lose
and you pay is a fair way to go about it.  What about the people who have
genuinely been wronged but lose the case due to technicality or because the
corporation has better lawyers?  A fairer way is for the judge to rule
whether the case was frivolous and impose a penalty.
