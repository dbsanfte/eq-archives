Seems like a pretty interesting place from what I've seen. The zone
line is buggy, it's in SolB, almost stacked on a zone line to SolA so
we had people zoning into SolC and others zoning into SolA from the
same spot, and if you zone back from SolA and come to SolC, you end up
at the other end of the dungeon. Between finding the place (even with
a loc), people dying on the way and zoning in the wrong end or into a
train..., it probably took us about 3 hours the first day to get
organized. It should be a lot easier if you can bypass SolB and just
go in from A. The SolB side has Kobolds, the other side Goblins at the
zone line. 

Zoning out is also buggy, I know a couple of people that swam through
the zone line and hit a dead end. Which can be problematic when you're
taking 70+ points per tick of lava damage on the swim out. Once you
get there, don't expect to pull singles (and expect trains from people
that can't seem to figure this out). Mobs aren't particularly
difficult even with just 2 shaman doing Crowd Control we didn't have
problems handling 3 or 4 at a time with a group ranged from 59 to 65
(average closer to 65 though). Our only death was when our puller
stumbed across a lvl 68+ mob and his 6 lvl 65 henchmen. 

Loot wasn't that great but I've seen some links to nice items so
there's good stuff in there. 

I'd say a good group of high 50s could handle the place but you'd
probably need a mezzer. From what I saw, a good high 50s group would
do better there than the groups I saw from a 'raid' guild. We watched
full groups wipe to things we then took out as a trio
(shaman/shaman/SK).
