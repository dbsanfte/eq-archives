It can easily be broken by hiding or singing invis song. My problem
with hide is it fails so often due to low skill - it caps at 40 for
bards as I understand. If your group can't wait the < 18 seconds,
screw 'em. It's a miniscule price to pay for the benefit they got from
having the mob charmed in the first place. I didn't think there were
any issues with breaking it with the invis song though. I just can't
ever spare a song slot for it.

What I've found works best for me is to simply keep an eye on mob hp
levels and stop my charm song ahead of time.
