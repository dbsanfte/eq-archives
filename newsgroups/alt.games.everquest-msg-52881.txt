 Technically not true. Once through the ice tunnel then yeah. Although
even on that side (Karnors) you're bound to run into Gorenaire who by
default isn't normally KOS to everyone. But on the other side (portal
area) there are non-kos mobs (to some). There is an iksar vendor mob
somewhere. I'm not sure where he spawns but I've never seen him in the
same spot twice. I'm thinking people like to train him around or
something.  So that lowers it to 99.95% of every mob in DL that wants
you dead. :)
