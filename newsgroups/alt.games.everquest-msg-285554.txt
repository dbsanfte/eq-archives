Aggro and damage aren't that screwed up.  There are times when a lot of
people take damage, but that's what healing assignments are for.  You
don't just put 6 healers in a group and say "Heal everybody."
Assignments are a part of strategy, which is a part of raiding.  Unless
you somehow end up being the only person able to heal or the only
person able to decurse (which, seriously...will never happen), you
won't be watching 40 bars.  If you're doing that now, have a chat with
your raid leader or healing leader and make assignments.

I have shelved my healer (shaman), but when I was raiding with him I
always had assignments of about 3-7 people to heal.  That's a lot
better than 40.  Also, don't forget that raids are being knocked down
to 25 people.
