Nice to know.  Thanks.

I'm totally new to Dual-wield, so thanks for clearing this up.  Going by
what you wrote, is this what could happen:

Primary: weapon with 40 delay, call it "Sword"
Secondary: weapon with 15 delay, call it "Dagger"

1) I hit autoattack.
2) The Sword attacks
3) The Dagger makes a dual-wield check, if so, it attacks
        ( not sure which should be 2 or 3, since it's the start, went with
primary hitting first - maybe the Dagger since it's faster )
4) 1.5 seconds later, the Dagger makes a dual-wield check, and if it
succeeds, it attacks again
5) 1.5 seconds later, the Dagger makes a dual-wield check, and if it
succeeds, it attacks again
6) 1.0 seconds later, the Sword attacks again
7) 0.5 second later, the Dagger makes a dual-wield check, and if it
succeeds, it attacks again

etc..  Is this right?
