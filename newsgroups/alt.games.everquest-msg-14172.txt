I think that this new policy is overreacting and is a very bad idea.

But let's look at it from their end.  Every time someone /petitions because
of a stolen item, it means lots of research on the part of Verant.  Someone
has to track down all the logs, find out if they actually had the item,
where it went to, who has it now, the IP address of the person that logged
in, etc, etc.

This is an incredible amount of time spent.

And I'd bet money that in 99% of those cases, the account owner gave the
password to the theif.  The remaining 1% is people that saw the password
written down.

I'd also bet money that there has never been a case of account hacking
resulting from sniffing packets or from a trojan spying on keystrokes. 

Ever.  Not once.

I'm not saying it isn't possible, I'm saying it's never happened.

So we have a big drain on customer service resources being caused by
people's own actions.  They're basically saying that if someone has stolen
something from you to not bother them about it because you are the one who
gave out your password.

Poor policy?  You bet.  Do I have any answers?  Not really.  I suspect that
accessing the various logs is a non-trivial endeavor, so putting some sort
of easy front-end on that would be an obvious first step.
