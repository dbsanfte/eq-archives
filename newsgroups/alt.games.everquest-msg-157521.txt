Did I say I was referring to the Harmony Patch?  VI is (or WAS) FAMOUS for
stealth nerfs.

That was a bit of venting over an annoyance.  Hey, it's what the poster
asked for!  There IS a germ of truth to it however, I've been trying to play
for three days now, and only managed to get a couple of hours in.  The
servers have been down in PRIME TIME (Morning AND evening) every day so far
this week.  My server is a continental US server, they COULD take it down in
the 12:00-4:00 A.M. range, but that isn't CONVENIENT to them.

 > Please, stop playing and spare us your unfounded whining.

You know, I am willing to believe that VI has changed in the last six months
if you tell me that it's so.  I came across my cynicism the hard way, by
dealing with them for the first three years that EQ was out.  Still, if you
want me to back up and give them another chance then I'll do so.

I'm beginning to have serious doubts however, that you can be anything but
nasty and insulting.
