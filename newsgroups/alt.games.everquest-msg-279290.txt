RSS is not intended for soloing.  If you want to solo, you have to find 
areas that have solo content.  Much like you can't expect to single group 
high end raid encounters.  (well, unless they are a few expansions old, 
then you might even be soloing them...)

As for grouping, the issue is not about the gear per se, it's about 
knowing what you can likely expect from a player.  If you want to get a 
serious xp group going, do you grab joe blow whom you don't know at all, 
or do you grab someone you know, or who belongs to a high end guild where 
a certain level of competency can be expected?  Personally, I first check 
if anyone in my guild, or on my friends list wants to go, then I go to 
the lfg tool.  I will agree that a certain level of gear/spells is pretty 
much required, particularly for the tank, and crowd control in RSS.  Off 
hand, I am not sure what level enchanters get their best mez at, 69 or 70 
I expect, which will require spending lots of time in MPG or a few select 
spots in other OOW zones to get.  Tanks have DoN in addition to other 
zones to gear up in.

The game is all about progression, always has been.  In order to hit the 
higher end zones, you have to first do your time in lower end zones.  
There is also certainly an issue for people who, for whatever reason, 
have not been able to develop a group of people to play with regularly, 
whether in a guild, or just informal group of friends.  That is not a 
gear issue as such either, it's just that other folks prefer to play with 
people they do know when they can.
