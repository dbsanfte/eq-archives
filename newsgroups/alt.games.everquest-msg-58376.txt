No, they've made it pretty clear that 8 is the most they'll ever have.  And
in answer to your later post, I'm willing to bet a few bucks that only a few
customers give a crap about adding more character slots.  Delete one of your
level 3 characters, I'm sure you have a few.

In answer to a possible follow up, if you play on a one-character server
you're screwed if you want a cat...you'll have to delete your current one to
do it.
