Ok, I spent 18 hours camping Gynok for the platinum ring. I spent 7 hours
camping the Mutant Fungus for the Copper and Gold rings. I even baked a Rat
Ear Pie.

Now for the love of Tunare can someone tell me how to find Vin Moltor?

This was supposed to be the easy part. I've spent over 8 hours camping this
guy. I'm in the Qeynos Sewers just to the west of entrance from the outside
North Qeynos wall. This is area "1" on the EQ Atlas map. It is also where
the Investigator spawns. I have killed hundreds of rats and skellies. I
don't want to kill the beggars for faction and role playing - after all I
did bake the pie.

Any help PLEASE!!!
