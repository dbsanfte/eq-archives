Thats strange because that contradicts the last press release where they said
there would be future expansions and new content for the original EQ, post
Planes of Power.I wouldnt pay attention to anything one of the guys at the show
said until a press release says different .I also think you will be suprised at
how many will be playing all the forms of everquest.I plan on continuing with
EQ1 till the end and also signing up for EQ2 at launch.I will also probably
play EQ Online Adventures since that doesnt require much time to play.
