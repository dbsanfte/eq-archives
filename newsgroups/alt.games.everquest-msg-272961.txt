Encounters are locked once they begin.  Having a higher level healer standing
behind you for the fight does no good, because they cannot cast heals on you
until the fight is over without being in the group, taking a share of exp (or
canceling out all exp for being too high level.)   Buffs also require grouping
with the buff giver.

The only thing an out of group person could do would be to heal you up after
each fight... but out of combat health and mana regeneration is already so
high that that's not a significant advantage.
