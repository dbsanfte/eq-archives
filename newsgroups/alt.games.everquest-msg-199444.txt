The only thing I will say to you, because of your decission to respond to my
original post in an arrogent and condecending tone,  is... Well, because
this is an open public form visited by miniors I'll refrain from typing what
I think and instead focus on allowing my civilized side to repress my other
less desirable side.  I would like to suggest that you refrain from being
precieved as so wise assed when responding to posts.  Just about everyone on
the planet knows that people who are frustrated by their excessive... Ah,
insecurity, to be on the politically correct side of the street, over
compensate when they feel secure enough to vent safely.  I'm sure you
wouldn't want anyone to think, not that you do or ever would, fit into such
a catagory, to think you might.

I will appoligize for allowing my anger to your post to cause me to respond
in an insulting and condecending way but I do have a bit of a temper.  I am
usually pretty good at containing it but its been a very busy year at the
work.  I shouldn't have posted that first message since I've been working a
lot of heavy overtime for the past 20 months now and I just finished a 27
hour shift Wed at 11am.  Even now I still haven't sleep for over 48 hours,
but in my profession thats not a totally unusual event.  I wanted to get my
EQ fix before I went to sleep.  Since I don't go back on duty till Sunday
morning I wasn't pressed to eat and sleep as so often has been the norm
until very recently.

It was childish of me to respond to your comments as I did and to insult a
total stranger because of their precived attack on me.  My gut reaction is
to become somewhat (well, to be honest about it, very) aggressive, which
often serves me well in my professional capacity but not in my personal life
when interacting with "average" people.  When one stays in my line of work
for any prolonged period of time it takes a toll on your ability to interact
in a socially acceptable manner when stressed.  Luckly working for the
Government I'll be able to retire in just 4 more years with 20 years in... I
just hope EQ is still around then! LOL

Anyway, you will respond as you will respond and all I can do is be
answerable for my behavior so I will appoligize for my previous post and
since EQ is STILL patching... Unbelievable!  This makes 3 or is it 4 patchs
in the past month now, but we all knew it was comming with the last
expansion... I'll go to sleep like I should have 8 or 9 hours ago and hope
to get to 49 by Fri. afternoon... :)
