Hi,

Ive just re-installed EQ, all expansions except Luclin.

I did the Kunark patch, fine, did the Velious patch, fine, did the optional
patch, fine... did all of these from inside my Eq folder.

I then dbl clk EQ to play and go through the normal patch. I get right to
the end, well the bar at the bottom is full. The last file I'm at is
"Vequip.s3_" , and then nothing, no through put on modem, just nothing. So I
cancel and try again, same thing.

Anyone any ideas whats happening here please?

Cheers

Kev
