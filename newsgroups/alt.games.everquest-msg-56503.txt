Druids got fantastic items. My 55 druid got a 1 ac 4 wis, 20 mana 20
hp earring from the mtn rathe event, these were lore and the wretched
mares dropped as many as two at once meaning people were giving them
away while trying to get the shoulders I also eventually got (later my
dark elf cleric came and got the same earring that was rotting just
inside the feeroot zone in 3 seconds). Better than that, it got a 3
wis,  10 mr, 10 cr and 10 FR shoulder slot item which is about the
best item for me in the game since I'm in an often raiding guild where
resistence is important. It beats the heck out of the version step of
the coldain shawl that I have.

Oh and I got a belt from the Qey hills event that is 6 ac, 5 wis, 5 MR
5 sta off varsoon the undying some ranger killed (belt being no drop
of course so he called it out) that beats a planes belt or more druid
belts I've seen. I also had the foresight to realize that when the
event was over and the zone reverted, hadden would spawn and no one
was camping hadden. After I got the belt and thanked the ranger i
gated back to my bind spot near hadded, blasted him and got an FBE.
Rather a nice morning for me in qey hills ;)

Treeweave is a very poor druid item actually. A druid's whole deal is
not getting hit so the 25 ac is kind of overkill. I'd go more for the
ulthork bp which is like 13 ac or whatever 3 wis and 35 mana and
probably less than 500 plat. Or the cured tizmak surcoat which is 15
ac and 7 mr, I'm wearing one currently at level 55 until I get my tov
bp since I'm at 204 wis anyway and like having 110 mr base. The funny
thing is I found the cured tizmak surcoat on vendors in thurg for 45
plat. I get out my natures shroud when doing fr or cr mobs.

Hmm actually in a bit you could camp a natures shroud with some
friends probably and have a grand time of it on mobs who would give
you xp, you might even be able to trade treeweave which is more of a
tank item stell for a natures shroud or some cash. Its a darn good
item in turns of ac, 6 wis, and fire and cold res all on one thing.

Nah, you are right basically, before velious uber quest armor really
even the fear plane spits out verm stingily as hell. Druids don't have
much option and up to 52 or so I was wearing basically what a level 35
druid could be under its own power (except the bd and diamond res
stuff I have and such is a bit out of their range maybe) Thank gad for
velious and semi easy to get level appropriate Coldain gloves, boots,
kromriff military leggings and rough silver chain,  all from quests
you can do alone or with a few friends in the case of coldain. Those
items really made my kit since I had terrible trouble with verm in the
planes and was not doing tov regularly yet in a guild. The swarm
mother in the karanas who occasionally dropped a diamond or BD was
quite nice also.

What is sorely missing really is a druid quest armor. Sks, Pallys,
warriors and even clerics are all basically wearing their quest armor
from level 30 or so to planes levels because its pretty good stuff.
Druid meanwhile is a patchwork of various questionable armors of
dubious orgin and ghettoness. Granted we are not as much of an AC
centric class but it could be good in other ways such as a few wis per
piece and some resistences/plus mana.
