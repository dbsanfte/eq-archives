I wanted to take my 45 high elf pally to Stonebrunt for the swiftclaw sash
quest and was wondering what to expect in paineel, since I understand there
is undead there. Does anyone have any tips to make my journey a bit safer? I
was thinking that invis vs undead might work, but wasn't sure about the
other inhabitants of the city. Cheers
