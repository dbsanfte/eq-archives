If anyone should get them on a class basis, it would be the
bottleneck class, the Cleric.  Anyone ever been to a raid
where they said "shamans, mana check?" How about
"Mages, Mana Check?"

No, its clerics slowing the works down to their pathetic
mana regen rate.

Shamen cannabalize, Mages have Mod Rods, but if you
have a cleric without a Modding Mage handy, then there
you are, waiting on their sorry butts.

While I dislike the class specific idea as a rule, its even worse
to see it implemented in a fashion that defies logic!
