To "stand up to" something implies that it represents a threat. You
never have, do not now, and never will represent a threat. You're a
mild annoyance with occasional, very limited, amusement value.

>Just gotta ask. I see it and I will prolly back off ya.

You mean you'd quit stalking me through the newsgroup? That would
pretty much mean you'd stop posting altogether. Certainly you've
contributed very little else around here.

>I am here for the underdogs

I'm sure the underdogs are gratified to have the profound benefit of
your most excellent representation.

The only ones that have ever called any of us "EQNG Gods" are those to
incorrectly claim that we've applied that title to ourselves. Just
because *you* perceive us as gods doesn't mean we see ourselves that
way.

>Too me, your punks and I have no problem telling you so.

Two problems, actually.

Filtering out your nonsense in no way shuts my mouth.
