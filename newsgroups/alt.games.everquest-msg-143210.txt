Exactly. In the countries of the former Warsaw Pact, the population 
didn't have access to any weapons, and yet, the people told the 
goverments "get lost, fellas, your time is up", and the goverments fell.

On the other hand, when you have a bunch of heavily armed civilians (I 
will not go into an appraisal of the mental capabilities of said 
civilians) who try to defend their perceived rights against the 
goverment, you get Waco.

I think the US is too far gone down the gun road for anything to be done 
about it, but to pretend that people keep guns to "safeguard their 
liberties against an oppresive government", rather than simply as a 
hobby, is a bit of a fantasy.
