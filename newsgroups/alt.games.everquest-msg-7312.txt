Wrong.
Velious auto-detects where you installed EQ\Kunark.
I have always installed to c:\games\EverQuest
When I install Velious, it puts everything in that folder.
Everytime.
And I like to re-format my HD about every other month or so.
So I do this quite frequently.

I know that doesn't solve the problem, but was just FYI.
