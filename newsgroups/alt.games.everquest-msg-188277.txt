Thanks to the new researchable priest spells I got Levitation tonight,
and am now missing only *one* of my < 65 spells. I have every single
other spell I can cast, including Beguile Plants, Healing Water, Pure
Blood and Ancient: Starfire of Ro. The one spell I am missing below 65
is Ancient: Legacy of Blades, and with any luck I'll get it before we
stop doing VT.

The less said about the 65 spells the better.  I have the worst luck
in EverQuest when it comes to rolling (with 1 exception, I bought or
was given all my 63-64 spells). I'm holding out hope the guild will
give me Blessings of the Nine, because we only have 1 druid with the
spell and Kazad+Nine is very popular. I have my doubts that getting a
full spellbook is possible. I've heard runes drop frequently in the
Elemental Planes so maybe there is some hope.

Speaking of the Elemental Planes, I am 2 flags behind most people in
my guild at the moment...I miss Mithanial Marr and Bertoxx. I'm
especially interested in Bertoxx because I got the Saryn flag out of
order and I want to make sure the Seer can fix it.

So naturally we haven't tried Bertoxx since the first successful kill.
We have tried MM again but haven't actually been able to take him
down. Repops are a real problem. Today we actually engaged him (no
small feat) and got him to 70. Then the MT went down and....something
went wrong. Tanks started dropping like flies. Within 60 seconds we
wiped. I'm getting tired of hearing how easy the first time was,
because it sure isn't easy now. I'm guessing the new tanks didn't get
their SS, but I'm not positive.

We tried Rallos Zek for the first time yesterday, with minimal
information. We got one of the Zeks to spawn, he ran off, came back
with a ton of his buddies and we wiped. We tried again, same thing
happened. There is obvious something we're missing.

The plan was to get everyone flagged for the Elemental Planes by the
end of March. It may happen, but I'm pessimistic.
