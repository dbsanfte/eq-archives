Kaev is a Half Elf Paladin of Mith. Marr, only possible starting city
is Freeport.  Depending on patron a Half Elf Paladin can have Freeport,
Qeynos, or Felwithe as a home city.  Even so, I took him to Kelethin
where my Ranger alt had tracked the LDoN NPC and talked to her, worked
fine.  From that I surmise that if the particular "home city" you go to
matters at all it must be based solely on race (Half Elf Warrior, Rogue,
Ranger, or Druid can start in Kelethin).  Well, ok, I'm guessing based
on a single data point, sue me.
