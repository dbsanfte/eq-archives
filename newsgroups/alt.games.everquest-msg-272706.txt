No, it's not illegal. They can ban you from their game because they
don't like your (real) name. As long as they don't continue charging
you, they're perfectly within their legal rights. It's private
property, and they are not required to allow -ANYONE- on it if they
don't want them there.

And, no, they've never banned anyone for simply posting a negative
opinion on the boards. They've banned people for posting childish,
obscenity and insult-laden hissy fits on the board.
