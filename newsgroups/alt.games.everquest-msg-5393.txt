I saw a thing today where a guy was saying that
for a fee he would take and play your character
and level it up something like 10 levels in a few
days for a hundred bucks.  There were various
price options but I won't get into it.

My wife is about to have another kiddo and I'm
seriously thinking of doing this if it were legit.
I know, it's a game, it ain't worth that much,
you're taking the easy way out etc... etc... But I
fear that my playing time will be severely limited
with the new kiddo coming along and life at 35 is
much better than life at lvl 25.    Buying ten
levels may sound stupid, but I want to see what
life at 35+ is like before I die.  Has anyone ever
done anything like this or will admit to it.  How
did it go?

Flame away.
