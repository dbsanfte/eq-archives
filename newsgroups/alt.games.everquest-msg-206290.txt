True.  But only on the "added value".  So, in theory, you should just end up
with an included tax for the "added value" of the product/goods/service.
The problem comes in the computations that can be used for services (though
most countries start at 0 for the value).  It should not be worse than a
single tax applied at the end of the process to the final sale price.  But,
then again, thoery and practice do not always agree.  At least in countries
with a VAT, you know the final price of an object without the benefit of a
calculator.  In Virginia, I think we have 3 different levels of sales tax,
some exempted items and some local sales tax.  Makes it difficult, at best.
