    My response to buff requests (as I am a Wizard and have no buff other
spells at all):
    "I'm a wizard, the only buffs I could give you would turn you into a
smoldering pile of ash."

    My response to Heal requests (which for somereason only seem to come
from people level 10-25):
    "Wizard heal spells are currently bugged, and only work in reverse."

> PORT ME

    "Sure, xx plat."
    "No way, that's way too much."
    "Nice day for a walk, isn't it?"
