Almost seems like they return to try and get validation from people they
obviously respect after having tried to sever the connection with the
previous game/community.  They'll inevitably get defensive and start mud
slinging once they realize that the accomplishments and attractiveness of
the game they currently tout cannot (easily), and most likely, will not be
verified by any members of the previous group.

And you're quite right.  It happens like clock work.
