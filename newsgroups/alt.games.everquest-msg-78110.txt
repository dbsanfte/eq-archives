Then you're not using all the F9 features to their fullest.

The first two F9 views are "behind" views.  But the next two
are totally "free-form" views.  Use:

   Alt-Home to take the camera farther away
   Alt-End to bring the camera closer
   Alt-Uparrow to raise the camera
   Alt-Dnarrow to lower the camera
   Alt-PgUp to rotate the camera clockwise around yourself
   Alt-PgDn to rotate the camera counter-clockwise

(From memory, I may have some of those backwards, but
you get the idea).

Note: All keys should be from your numeric keypad portion
of your keyboard (not counting the Alt key, of course).

Using these keys on the third or fourth F9 view, it's
a piece of cake to get a very nice frontal or three-quarters
screenshot of your character.  And using the usual left/right
arrow keys will turn your character relative to the "camera".
Animation emotes work as usual, so you can /wave for the
camera, etc.
