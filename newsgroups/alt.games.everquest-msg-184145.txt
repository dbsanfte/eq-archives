I can agree that this man had mental and social problems which are the =
issue here. But eq is more than just some symptom of these conditions. =
It is a very sophisticated form of escapism -the most sophisticated I =
know of. This mans addiction to the game is not an isolated case, see =
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EverQuest-Widows/

There are some pretty depressing stories there and it is just the tip of =
a large iceburg.

It is interesting to step away from the eq you know and see it in a =
different light: if you don't maintain your addiction you lose so much.

This may seem extreme to some, but im sure most people whove played this =
game for long periods have felt their lives closing a little, and =
withdrawal symptoms imbetween sessions.
