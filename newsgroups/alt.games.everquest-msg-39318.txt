Bwaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahaha.

Well if the... <snigger> TLC... death of EQ... <guffaw>

Excuse me.

Bwaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahaha.

Ok, I'm better now.

No, people are not leaving in droves.  At least, not over something as stupid
as TLC.  You're living in your own little world, hughes, if you think
otherwise.  The violently anti-TLC people can't even get their story straight.
Either it's (a) trivially easy to get around via PL'ing someone and looting
for them (in which case I fail to see what the big deal is) or (b) completely
ruins the game because now level 60 powergamers can't get stuff off of level
15 mobs (I can't be the only one failing to see the significance of this).

Holy sweet mother of fuck it's amazing what people get riled up about here.
