Having done DL on and off thru half a dozen characters, I don't really 
think you can say "the xp is good" and have me take it with a straight 
face.  Its a normal outdoor zone, 75 ZEM, and the mobs aren't especially 
easy to kill or anything to make up for it, its much like fighting in 
OT; its decent exp because most of the people your level are there so 
you can get a full group and kill fast.  Loot and xp though are really 
poor on a per  mob basis (loot is poor on any standard)

It does strike me that you are probably right about it being a good 
playground to learn charm in, though, with a nice open flat no adds area 
to kite around in as needed and plentiful mobs easy to single pull 
roaming nearby.

I'm familiar with the concept from having a druid partner with my 
cleric, and from playing a bard to 57.

What I'm saying, though, is that toe to toe melee plus charm pet 
probably means less DPS output than the enchanter would generate solo 
charming; instead of the chanter pet getting hurt while hurting the 
target, its me taking the hits, the chanter pet is undamaged!

I'd think the ideal partner for a chanter would be a necro, who could 
send in his pet with taunt off so chanter pet keeps aggro, plus can DOT, 
do emergency healing, emergency mezzing, emergency rooting... all from 
out of melee range so as not to have the victim stop doing damage to the 
charmed pet.
