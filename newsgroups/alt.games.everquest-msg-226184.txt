I've been back for the 14days thing. Been gone maybe 4mons or a lil more,
lil sketchy on that number. But anyway have they worked on them? Cause its
not cause theres less people in zone. There are actually more. Especially
newbie zones I'm seeing lots of 65's. I'm guessing thats the generated
dungeons with LDON?

So, are loading times better? My connection nor anything on my comp has
changed.

Second why so many 65's in plain old EQ zones? LDON?

Thanks.
