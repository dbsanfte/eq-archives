Do me a favor, go work on a major software project that's been
developed by someone else and then come along and try and change
something like buff stacking as implemented.

Then go back and see what you broke.

I laugh everytime someone attempts to post pseudo-code that "solves" a
problem trivially on these boards.

No kidding, really?  Never would have thought that.
But wait, how about effects that traverse classes?  Or are we gonna
limit buffs to just one type of effect and only that effect?

How about a buff like shissar?  AC buff and haste buff.
Or Focus of Spirit?  Str, Dex and hp buff.
Or how about PotG?  AC, hps and mana regen.
Or INT caster skin line?  AC, hps and MR.  But wait, it's not a hp
buff like WIS caster buff, it doesn't "heal" at the same time.  So
it's a subtly different buff...

If it's a piece of cake to code, code it.
Hell, don't even have to go that far.  List out all the combinations
that can potentially stack and not stack taking into account the
different effects.  A simple chart will suffice.  There's only a few
dozen spells per class to deal with.  And of course, don't forget the
various NPC spells with counter effects.  Make sure to take those into
account as well.

Let me know when you're done.
