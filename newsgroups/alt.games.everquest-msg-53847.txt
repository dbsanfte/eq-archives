You're right, I didn't think of petitioning it because it was the name of
celebrity.  Because Mezzmer probably doesn't know about Mesmer.  I was
dreading the day when the kid makes 20 and picks 'Rizer' as his surname.

I don't believe Verant would have allowed Mesmer through the filters.  If
there was misspelling in that name, I'm pretty sure it was deliberate.
