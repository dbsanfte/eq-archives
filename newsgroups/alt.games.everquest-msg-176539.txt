Opinions differ.....

The BL epics are H2H, and if memory serves H2H is also the skill with
the highest cap.. So "technically" you could use H2H 1-65 and be fine.

The problem is that there are VERY few really good H2H weapons for the
mid-late levels that aren't extremely rare, hard to get, or expensive.
On the other hand there are some fantastic 1HB, 1HP and 2HB weapons
out there that can be found for good prices in the bazaar. (especially
the heavier ones that monks avoid due to weight issues) 

There really is no "right" answer to your question. If you don't mind
taking the time to max the other weapons skills. then go for it. If
your main goal is to get your epics, then going exclusively H2H isn't
a mistake.
