}Well, depending what class you are... for a wiz or druid it sounds
}like the complete waste of a bind spell....

Well, a wiz or druid over 19, but generaly speaking, indeed. :)

}Ain't gonna do any non-iksars hunting in LoIO or around there any
}good, or in SRO or Feerrott.... I'd sure as hell hate to drop into the
}entrance of Oggok, Cabilis, or Grobb with a level 14 character that
}isn't welcome there (or any character that isn't welcome there for
}that matter)....

This is what invis is for.  My little Gnomie uses this express route to 
Cabilis fairly often.

}Then there's the chance that you die, return to your bind point in the
}room, only to get whacked by Faydedar about fifteen or twenty times
}before you managed to kill the loop.... only to log back on thirty
}minutes later to get whacked fifteen or twenty more times....

Been down here well over 100 times at this point.  Never seen Faydedar 
once...  He actually spawns rather a ways from the firepots, up to the 
northeast a couple thousand units.  I think it's pretty unlikely anyone 
could train him that far.

Still, you can't bind there anyway, unless you managed to in the first 15 
minutes or so after the patch it was created in.  Was it in Kunark from 
the beginning, or added later?

}Personally, it seems to work fine the way it is. Bind in OT or FV,
}take the boat to TD, and fly or swim from there.... of course, this
}will still take you to a <city>, and if you're fighting in Rathe Mts.
}or some other relatively remote zone, you're <still> going to have a
}long run... I'd prefer to simply bind near the area I'm hunting in,
}thanks.

Yep.  I pretty much agree.  It would come in dead handy, though, for 
doing certain intercontinental quests over and over.  It is also lacking a 
firepot to Velious...

Rathe Mountains, though?  Why, that's right next to the Oggok 'porter.  I 
love being seen Warmly by Oggok guards. :)
