  Actually, I just started one of these. It's been a blast so far--I'm
playing him as thoroughly evil (as opposed to my Erudite necromancer,
who's just basically misunderstood). Who thought spreading pain and

  He just got his first spells last night. I can't wait to see what
kind of difference they make.
