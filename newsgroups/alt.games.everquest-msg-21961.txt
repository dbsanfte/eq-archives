I have an example of when losing my cool actuall benefited me. Out in EC with
my pet i spied a young kodiak. He conned yellow and as i was full health and
mana i thought id take him on. So i cast clinging darkness and snd the pet in.
Then i remember that i didnt give my pet a weapon and hes hitting like a girl.
I get all worked up about still winning and cast all my DD's and DoT's while
keeping a close eye on my pets health. So the pet is almost dead and the kodiak
has maybe a third while i have just enough mana to gate. I start flapping, cant
decide what to do when the bear decides for me, kills the pet and comes to me
for dessert. I melle like a madman and use the remaining mana while taking a
whupping like only a caster can. Im almost dead, the kodiak has a foot (paw) in
the grave and he starts to run for it! YAY!.........

He runs straight into the arms of a wandering guard who kindly KS my hard
earned kodiak.  
ARGHHHH!
