OK, first point I dont yet have SoL, so this is Eq/Kunark/Velious under
the upgraded software and hardware requirements.

System
Voodoo3 3000
Celery 300A running at base 30MHz speed
128Mb PC100 SDRAM
1x6 gig HDD with EQ on it...plus 1x10gig HDD as the slave
Soundblaster live 1024
Win98
DX8.0a
56k modem connect thru NTL


OK First thing, I ran the patch..read the patch message...saw that
for Win 98 DX8.1 was required so I upgraded that. Ran EQ and its fine.
Zoning takes a little longer than it used to but repeated zoning back and
forth across one zone line speeds up. I didnt need to upgrade my sound or
video drivers.

I see no black boxes at all, I get nice new models for several of the mobs
I see...most notably skeles. Game runs fine in 800x600 fullscreen view
with velious textures. There's a little slowdown in busy areas but there
always was and its not enough to cause any problems (had to actively look
for it) and the problem I had of right mouse click not being recognised
turns out to be my mouse button failing after much hammering in FPS games
as well as EQ.

System Stable and gameplay fine, graphical niceties wonderful.

I get the impression that I can expect Luclin at Xmas so we'll see how it
handles all the new stuff....though I do intend to grab a 256 stick of
memory before then
