That is exactly what he did!  I asked him how many points he had trained in it,
he responded "one".  The ranger immediately said "I think we'll need you using
your best weapons until we complete the mission".  Warrior stood there for a
minute and then said, "this is the only weapon I brought".  
We were in Mistmoore.  Long way from the bank.  The timer was *on*.  Sigh.  
I just wondered if this was a *normal* practice:  the concept of "Hey, I'm in a
full group, they won't really *need* my firepower".  He said this *was* his 1st
dungeon, but wouldn't you want to be at your *best* in your first dungeon????  


>Did any of that happen?  Or did you just decide it bugged you later on?

It didn't bug me until we realized how slow we were moving:  Group was:
enchanter, ranger,  warrior, druid, shaman, cleric.  Druid was nuking,
enchanter was mezzing, shaman cannabalized like crazy and told me not to heal
him (he was always under 60% health), ranger stoically pulled AND main tanked. 
(I wasn't the only one running on 30% mana).
Of course, we had no other recourse but to quit the mission, so it was a moot
point.  
I'm pretty new to the *pickup group* myself, but I did learn one thing: 
Dragging dead warrior weight on a mission is *not* fun.  (Hell, dragging dead
*anything* weight isn't fun).
