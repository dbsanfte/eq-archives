Level 33 can be done in loio really really easily as a druid. Youll need to
track to find the blue cons, but there are enough around. Just use thorns
and dot on the mob (creeping crud). Maybe 1 nuke if your armor class sucks.
At level 34, loio is realy too green to stay in. head over to fm and solo
giants at the giant fort, or pull stuff to just north of the fort (mobs dont
wander here).

Alternatively, if you want to level fast, load up ensnare, greater healing,
regeneration (at 34), skin like stone, strength, sow, and go find a group in
The Overthere as a healer. Grouping is pretty easy as a druid. Just remember
to snare things, cos fleeing monsters are a pain in the ass. (kitties dont
run)
