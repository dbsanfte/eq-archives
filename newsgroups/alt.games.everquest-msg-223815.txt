seb with a partner (necro probably best, enchanter also very nice, shaman
works too) would be profitable in many ways

i think you can solo velks, but i'm not sure .. . pulling singles might be
hard at 51

of course PoJ comes to mind, but something tells me you wont be heading
there =)


CoM would probably be fun, though i dont know much about it since the revamp
. . .and the hole, of course, is where i have seen many an elementalist at
work, solo

good luck
