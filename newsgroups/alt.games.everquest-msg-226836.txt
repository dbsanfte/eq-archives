I have a newly dinged 51 cleric alt so I haven't had a lot of time to
explore the higher level game, but it sounds like you did everything
right.  Personally I hate it when people die, but it only really bothers
me when I was distracted and the death was my fault.  When you
do everything in your power and it still happens, hey, it still happens,
I have a 59 Enchanter who has died 90 times, with a 96 rez I don't
sweat it anymore (even 90% was good).
A 90 % rez will bring you with in 1-2 kills of where you were before.
A 96 % seems to be with in about 1/2 a kill.
I'd also like to say that any ranger at that level should know that if
he pulls agro he's tempting his own fate.
I do have one question though, why use Superior Healing instead of
Remedy?  (Just a personal question since I just got Remedy)
