Must be a dying server or something.  I'm on Vazaelle and on some
afternoons and evenings, there are often 80-120 people in PoK alone.
My allied guilds tried to form a hedge raids for those who don't have
the flag and within 15 minutes there were 27 peoples waiting.  We
didn't advertise to anyone outside the alliance and some people had to
volunteer to leave as there is a limit of 18 in hedge.
