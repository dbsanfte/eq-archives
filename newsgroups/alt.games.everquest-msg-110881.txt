Ah, may the Force be with him. : )

We just got done with a very successful CRdok raid ourselves.

I've been on two very different, yet highly successful styles of raiding there
now.   The raid where I got my own queen blade was small, precise and focused.
About 18 people, all level 60, and the vast majority being from the local
server uberguild.  One of their clerics was going down for the King and one of
my friend (who left our guild to join them) invited me along.  They off'ed the
queen as long as they were in the neighborhood.     It was pretty
incredible... some great people were there.   We were done in a bit over an
hour after we started in, killing all 3 royals.

The raid we did today was bigger.  We had around 40 people, and pretty much
went in and AE'ed the entire place.  Really very fun, and relatively fast
moving.   Prince on the way in, two kings and two queens.   Doing AoE in
Chardok was a blast.   Pulling whole rooms down at a time, while we waited for
the next royal to show up.   A few were taking bets on how many I could get
there... but the locked doors prevented me from really cleaning up : P
