Lull is the primary tool, along with the invis song.  The main element 
is skill and hard work, and knowing the mobs very well.

The bard's get out of bad pulls free card is Fade, which drops all aggro 
and invises the bard.  However, see invis mobs in-range of the bard will 
re-aggro, so you have to be aware of that.

Lazy bards can run invis to their target, aggro it, run back and then 
just fade off the aggro they don't want.

Awesome bards run to the target with invis and lull, get their target, 
and run back using lull, invis, mezz if required and fade at the end if 
it went badly.

The thing to remember about bard mezz too, is that once you sing mezz on 
a target, it continues to mezz that target even if you switch to a new 
target.

Note : I've never played a bard ;)
