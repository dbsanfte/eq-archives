It's quite easy to show that this is wrong with the "3-spawn" in the
northeast corner of that area that is almost never (maybe never, I don't
recall) a basilisk, but often a HG.

As far as the minimum goes, you can get it down to no HGs up, but when those
spawns recycle you'll get HGs again.  If you're killing PHs the whole time,
you'll get replacements up to the "soft minimum" much faster.
