My first thought was that the four movement keys could be mapped the same 
for all "shifted" states, so that you could shift on the fly without 
stopping.

The Tacticalboard I had before worked as an HID (human interface device) 
in Windows XP. It was basically recognized as a keyboard with the various 
buttons actually mapped to various keys from a standard keyboard. 
However, and I don't know why exactly, there were also various input 
anomolies. For example, you often were sent into a non-stop spin if you 
hit the movement keys just wrong. The movement keys were actually mapped 
to the arrow keys, I believe, but they weren't completely reliable.

Additionally, the macro facilities consisted of assigning string values 
to output when a button is pressed. These strings were sent to the screen 
at about the same speed as I might type them, not as an immediate 
command.

I'm hoping the Nostromo doesn't exhibit similar flaws.
