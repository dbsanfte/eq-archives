Ghandi is a red herring.  His success was based upon a knowledge
of the underlying basic decency of the British.  Had he pulled the
same stunt if Nazi Germany were in charge of India, he would have
been just another dead Indian.  This is a guy who claimed that
the *right* thing to do would have been for the British to
surrender to the Nazis and for the Jews to commit mass suicide.

Ghandi's advice to the British:


    ...I want you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for
    saving you or humanity.  You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor
    Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your
    possessions. Let them take possession of your beautiful island with
    your many beautiful buildings. You will give all these, but neither
    your souls nor your minds. If these gentlemen choose to occupy your
    homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage
    out, you will allow yourself, man, woman and child to be
    slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them ... I am
    telling His Excellency the Viceroy that my services are at the
    disposal of His Majestys Government, should they consider them of
    any practical use in enhancing my appeal....


Yeah, that would have worked great against Hitler.

Ghandi's advice to the Jews to embrace death:

     ...If one Jew or all the Jews were to accept the prescription here
     offered, he or they cannot be worse off than now. And suffering
     voluntarily undergone will bring them an inner strength and joy
     which no number of resolutions of sympathy passed in the world
     outside Germany can. Indeed, even if Britain, France and America
     were to declare hostilities against Germany, they can bring no
     inner joy, no inner strength.  The calculated violence of Hitler
     may even result in a general massacre of the Jews by way of his
     first answer to the declaration of such hostilities. But if the
     Jewish mind could be prepared for voluntary suffering, even the
     massacre I have imagined could be turned into a day of
     thanksgiving and joy that Jehovah had wrought deliverance of the
     race even at the hands of the tyrant. For to the Godfearing, death
     has no terror. It is a joyful sleep to be followed by a waking
     that would be all the more refreshing for the long sleep.


The way of Ghandi is to embrace death.
