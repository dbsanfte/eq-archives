I'm also curious if Chorkie has her summoned hammer that procs and yaulp
with mana regen?  At that level, she should consider wading into combat
with her hammer and Yaulp.

I know that in the trio I fight with(warrior, druid and me as cleric),
back then and even now, I'm in the thick of things.

Slap on the reverse damage shield on the mob(or healing shield if mob
happens to have a DS on so it's then dispelled).
Send in pet hammer.
Jump in behind the mob and bash/crush away while yaulping.

With the added dps of the cleric alone and their proccing hammer, you
tend to need to do less healing.

At 64, I rarely have CH memmed and instead opt for a HoT and a quick
heal for emergencies.

With a full group, you shouldn't need to CH at all.  Throw in a HoT and
keep battling instead of being out of commission for 10 seconds.

I only revert to doing the ch/sit/med thing if things are really really
tough for the 3 of us to handle.(ie: the mobs are eating the warrior
alive).
