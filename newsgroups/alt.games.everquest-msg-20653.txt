Actually, I averaged 1 blue per hour in Dreadlands in a full group. That was
with constant pulling and the usual group related downtime. And, I've got
the 20% exp penalty - so a non penalty race should get more than a blue an
hour.  I had read that a monk got through 45 in 8 hours in the Pool Room..
now THAT is fast! Wouldn't surprise me though.. I could easily kill a
greater kobold solo, without losing much health.

Last night I grouped with a warrior and a necro, and then just the necro.
Dreadlands is SO much better with two or three people instead of a full
group. And, I was actually having fun. When the warrior went LD, the necro
and I fear kited. It completely rocked (a necro and 2 pets, haha). All told,
I got 5 blue in a little under 4 hours, which included one death for the
necro, and a long run to get him a 60 rez. It was also a lot more relaxed
than chainpulling for hours on end.

I've got 3 blue to go.. will knock that out tonight no problem, then I have
tomorrow and Friday afternoon to get my "safety" into 46 (hopefully all the
way to 47). Then at 8pm EST on Friday night I'll be going on my first planes
raid.

Woot! :-)
