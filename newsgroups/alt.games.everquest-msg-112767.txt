there on his lily office chair pad pretending to be the last boss off
from super mario brothers 2 for nintendo entertainment system, well i
got news for you guys, ever-quest and the movie lord of the rings have
something in common, there both fucked up and they are both supported
by the supporters of this screwed up game, now is it true frog that
you have a charater named bilbo bagins? you fruit... you would have to
sit there at the dwarfs inn and pray on innocent wood elfs looking for
some lord of anal ring sex, dont denie it... you and your homo
supporters of this game have a secret meeting place in the unchanted
woods where you all like to have a sip of tea and gain points by
showing how manly you all are by having digital intercourse, this ever
quest game couldnt be any gayer. just imagine a bunch of guys playing
with each other, what is that suppose to make me think?... im glad i
never got into this game, something was trying to keep me out, and for
good reason too. the force is strong with me i quess... ha... jedi i
am, but not what you jerky boys will be... no... youll be neverless a
bunch of wood pecking homos playing this gay game on this gay
supported server, thats brought to you by gay sony... heh! eat that!..
