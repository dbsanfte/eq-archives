It gets better, a bit. My lvl 34 spells cost me 18pp a piece with 96 cha at
a apprehensive merchant. But with the kind of loot you get around that level
it's not so hard to get the 150pp or so. The cost for increasing my research
skill with 5 points is almost as much :)

It's harder to get all the ingredients for your research spells especially
because you almost always need to have 2 of each because of failures. I only
have 1 of the 3 researchable spells ever spell level starting with lvl 24.
Just the one I really wanted. I'm still on the lookout of any ingredient
drops with every kill any group of mine does.

I also noticed that the orcs in Crystal Caverns drop a huge amount of words
and runes. In the 4 days I'm now there I almost got as many scrolls and
runes as I did the past 4 to 5 weeks in Splitpaw, Loio and Unrest.
