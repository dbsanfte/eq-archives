Sounds like something that happened to me the other night. I was trying
to get to High Keep from Freeport. I had never been farther west than
West Commons, but I knew I had to pass through this place called
Kithicor Forest to get where I was going. Like an idiot I didn't bother
to research the route I was taking because I figured I would only be
passing through, from one zone line to another. So it's the middle of
the night and I zone into Kithicor, and start running down the path,
humming a little song to myself. So far, so good. Unfortunately, the
path ended and I now have no idea where I'm going, so I just pick a
direction and keep running. However, I am getting a little nervous now
because I've heard the place can be dangerous at night. As I'm
continuing, a guildmate in North Ro asks me to come group, and I tell
him that I'm in Kithicor and will meet up with him after I return from
High Keep. He says, "Cool. See you then." I add, "As long as I don't
die." No more than 5 seconds later I see "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT". In my
blind run I ran smack dab into what looked like a little fortress
surrounded by undead nasties. I tried to run away but I got hit. Once. I
was only hit once. For 881 points of damage. Some guy named Vasi T'ghera
whacked me but good. I never saw him and still don't know who he is or
where he is. The funny part was my guild had two messages from me: the
one that said "As long as I don't die," followed 10-15 seconds later by
one saying, "I died." Luckily a high level guildmate (lvl 40 Shadow
Knight) I believe went in to try to recover my body. He died after
getting hit for 881 points of damage. We probably spent the next hour
trying to sneak these corpses out of there. Luckily he had some
invisibility, etc. so I finally saw my body being dragged toward the
zone line. I tell you, it was a relief to finally get it back!

I don't want this anger that's burning in me.
It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
