Ok from what I have read, and someone here will correct me if I'm not all
right, is that High Elf Enchanters are the ones to go for it you want to
make jewelry.  I guess they have a higher base intelligence.  Personally I
have a DE Enchanter, and I really like her.  I guess for the simple reason
that I can change shape and be who I need in a good town.  I didn't really
start out to do a tradeskill with her, but after collecting a ton of wolf
meat when she was a baby, I decided to try my hand at baking.  Its fun, and
I don't have to buy food for a long time now.  Whatever you decide, have fun
with it.
