I'll take a look at the link, but personally, I'd rather speak to a wiccan
than read the books.  For me, that tends to be the clearest way to learn new
concepts and ideas, as questions can be answered and gaps filled
immediately, as opposed to trying to search for something that may or may
not be addressed.  At least, that's the way I prefer to train people, since
it works best for me.
