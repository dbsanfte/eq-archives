I'm going through almost exactly the same thing.  My cat is 17.5 and was
diagnosed about 2 months ago, and I give him 2 injections a day.

He's also very much My Cat...the first few times at the vet were horrible.
But the fact is, he has no choice but to adapt...he's going to need vet care
constantly for a few months at least.

He can do home BG testing...I haven't started that yet...not really looking
forward to it.  Pricking paws or ears doesn't seem all that much fun. :p

BTW, my cat doesn't mind the shots at all.  I use the 30 gauge 5/16"
needles.  I stuck myself to see what he's feeling and it's only mildly
discomforting.
