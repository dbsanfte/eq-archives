I got mine changed simply by making up a long winded role playing reason
about how my family was ashamed of my supposive actions that I didn't even
commit. My family shuns me for reasons that I do not understand, they insult
me for the simple fact that they did not investigate the actions I
supposively commited and I no longer wish to hold the name of my family, I
wish a name of honor, a name I can try to live up to until I once again gain
my family's trust, blah blah blah, etc, etc..

and like 10 minutes alter it was changed...
