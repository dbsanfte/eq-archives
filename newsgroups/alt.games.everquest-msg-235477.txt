Just checked a handful of things and this was a pretty big nerf.  I would
say 95+% of everything people would consider donating for favor lost about
90% of its pre-patch value.

It they do end up taking away points next week, based on transactions people
made at the old prices...thats going to piss me off.  I want my money back
rather than 10% of the favor I have now.
