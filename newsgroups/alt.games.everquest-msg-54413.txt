It wasn't just me, most of the people in my raid (kael arena,
of course, lovely place to be alone when you log back in)
also went LD at the same time.

I was able to log back in after rebooting, but I'm guessing that
really I was able to log back in after being gone ten minutes,
rebooting had nothing to do with it other than as a forced
delay mechanism.

What I mean to say is, what ass thought that taking out the
ability to check and see if its verant or me that's the problem
was a good idea?

Its been said before, many times, many ways.  Merry F*ing
xmas, you're in our world now.
