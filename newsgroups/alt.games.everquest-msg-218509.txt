The one thing that still bugs me is that they continue to introduce new 
items to the game that obsolete the usefulness of most tradeskill created 
items.  I have well over 100 in all of the tradeskills that my shaman can 
learn, and the only actually useful stuff I can make is in Alchemy, and 
that is limited to a very small handful of the huge array of potions out 
there.  My original intent was to hit 200 in all tradeskills, and 250 in 
smithing, this was before the Tanaan Crafting Mastery was added.  Since 
then, the items I could have made with smithing have become obsolete.  It 
is increasingly becoming the case that the only reason to have high 
tradeskills is to perform a few quests, and they are otherwise fairly 
useless.

The problem is not so much the tradeskill created items, as the 
progression of droppable gear that is now available in the game.
