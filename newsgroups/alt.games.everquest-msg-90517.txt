Actually, no one screamed anything to the zone. We aren't a bunch of
assholes and it isn't as though it would have done any good anyway. =P A
bit of "OMFG! I don't believe what this dumbass GM just did!" in guild
and on the guild's ezboard account was about the extent of it, and I
think that was pretty justified considering how much time and
frustration he'd cost us. (It had, after all, taken 4 hours for the big
dog to show up and we'd stood there in EK all that time waiting for
him.)

And I didn't suggest the offenders should have been stripped and beaten,
etc., (although I'd bet dollars to donuts it wasn't the first time these
folks had been involved in something questionable considering their
guild tag, and I admit I can't help wondering if their characters would
be improved if their parents had beaten them a bit more often in their
younger days. /grins evilly) Still, *some* punitive action would have
been appreciated, like maybe taking their ill-gotten gains away from
them. I've seen GMs do just that in similar circumstances, so I know
it's within their power. If someone breaks the rules, and the powers
that be know about it and choose to turn a blind eye, it's a pretty safe
bet what they're going to do the next time such an opportunity presents
itself.
