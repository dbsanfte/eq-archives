Several fletching guides I have paged through contained the wonderful gem of
knowledge "You gain skill faster if you have the instruction book in your
inventory while you fletch."

But honestly these things show up in every game.  (For instance, in the UO
Newsgroup we had the lead game designer state repeatedly that food had no
effect on anything except hit point recovery.  Yet morons would constantly
post how you had to eat *just* the right amount to get increased skill gains.)

It's generally a matter of the human tendency to try and see patterns in
things, whether they are there or not.  Well, that and poorly programmed
random number generators.
