Well, Ive popped over there at lvl 41 and I was one of the lowest levels
there and I dont recall seeing anyone of lower than lvl 35 at the time. A
group of you might wander over en masse and do over the beach area. Thats
as far as I got hunting DBs and LBs to me in that area solo.

I'd suggest a few more levels in the more usual areas first myself or a
good group.
