Ah, well thats what I thought initially, but my excursions into looking 
this stuff up on the web made it pretty clear I'd been wrong.  At least 
I can still research shaman spells as a mage, could have been worse, I 
could have been wrong -and- it could have been some other class that was 
needed.

Any 50+ mobs, in any zone, any expansion?  Or is there more to it than 
that?

Maxing out Research skill at my guildmaster took me to 185 skill.  I'm 
lead to believe (from an old Prima guide, a very unreliable source) that 
the skill caps out at 200 for all int casters.  Is there some sort of 
level based formula thats making me cap out lower than that at level 52?

Splendid
