When do pallies get taunt?  I've never had one but someone told me years ago
that they didn't have that skill.

If there were more than one and everyone was fighting a different critter,
either root or have someone else root yours (assuming no enchanter...then
you'd be yelled at for messing with crowd control).

You gotta trust your healers...lots of times that'll mean death, but you
can't go running around, especially if you happen to have an undead critter
on you.  You'll probably shake the critter off ya, but will get someone else
killed and that's very low-class.
