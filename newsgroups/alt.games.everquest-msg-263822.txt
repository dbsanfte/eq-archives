Oddly enough I think that the problem here is a culture clash,  age is
an ALT group... kind of wild and woooly. SO when Julie "suggested"
that Annie stop feeding the troll Annie responded to several things.
First the Suggestion that she do anything
Second and more important the suggestion that she didn't know how to
identify a troll.
IN age and many other ALT groups feeding/baiting/playing with trolls
is perfectly acceptable. And can be an amusing sport.  Aparently it is
not so in comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg.

Trolls such as the FA invasion, have been met with mixed baiting and
ignoring, but nothing particularly organized.  OTOH, mass killfiling
tends to occur more frequently with personality clashes, Taras v
bizbee, DT v Lokari, etc.

Trolls are met with less interest here than in other more wild and
wooly places, but nevertheless troll-baiting is not necessarily a
cardinal sin... evidently in COMP it is.
