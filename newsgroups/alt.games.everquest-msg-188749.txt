From the shadows, the mysterious "TheSingingCat"
<meowmeowmeow@meowmeowmeowmeow.com> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

>I'm sure we've all been there on numerous occassions.  You just died 3 times
>really fast, you can't find a group, you get tired of the consistent sitting
>for HP or mana, packet loss/lag or just plain burned out.   When this
>happens (assuming you still feel like nerding out) what game(s) do you fire
>up?
