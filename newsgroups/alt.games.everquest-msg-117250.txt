Don't know about that, but a feature to remove it has been in the game
now for a long ass time:

eqclient.ini

[Defaults]

ShowInspectMessage=FALSE

I'm not sure if this is also affected by the server side
message filtering, or if that is only for things you can
turn on or off in chat.

Also under [Defaults]

ServerFilter=1

(or on that one you can type /serverfilter on 
while in game) This makes it so things you turn off in the chat
options, are also not sent to your computer. Without enabling that,
they still ARE sent to your computer but you just don't see them =
more net lag.
