You could always do worse than look to join the Jesters In Norrath.
We're known on AB for having a laugh and we organised the first Guild
Olympic Games this year.

Our main site is down for the moment (the domain is being moved) but
we have a temporary thing on
http://pub79.ezboard.com/bjestersinnorrath if you want to have a look.

The rules of admission are few.  To join you have to be on a raid or
an event organised by us.  You have to bring some drinks for all and
have a song ready (this you can put on the site).

When the domain is moved then we will be back at
www.jestersinnorath.com but this may take a few weeks as we are
fighting some strange German ISPs at the moment.

Cheers
  Malc
 (Fantodus - Jesters In Norrath)
