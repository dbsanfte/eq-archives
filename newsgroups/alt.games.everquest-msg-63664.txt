I'm not sure which side it falls on in the argument, really...

But consider Dennis Rodman. :)

Yes.  EQ is a game.  I have doubts about the assertion an earlier poster 
made that it is -just- a game, but that's neither here nor there.  Another 
earlier poster said that we should 'relax' and 'enjoy it', and 'not be so 
serious about it' since it is -just- a hack and slash game.  What they are 
missing is that many of us enjoy taking it seriously.  And their absolute 
refusal to follow a simple enough goddamn rule makes it much harder for us 
to relax, take it seriously, and enjoy.

What is it that they enjoy so much about defying the rule?  How is it 
relaxing to choose a name designed to get you in trouble with GMs?
