Well I certainly don't mean the pioneer's definition of "explore". You 
get to a dungeon zone line, run around trying to make head or tail of 
the layout of the zone while avoiding unknown mobs only to get lost 
inside and killed by something you've never seen before which sees 
through invis, then have to try and find a Necro who is around at the 
time and willing to summon your corpse for you.

No thanks, that doesn't sound appealing. I'll let someone else do that 
for me and I'll follow the map.
