Well, sure.  You're taking more attacks so you get more chances to
skill-up your defensive skills.  I've never noticed any such trend
for offensive skills, except of course for the skill Offense itself
when I've had a damage shield on me (damage shield hits appear to
have the same chance of getting an Offense skill-up as weapon, h2h,
and archery hits).
