Arena? Hard?

Arena is trivial with a 60 druid and 60 DC enchanter duo.  Can do PoZ and
Icewall spawns too with a monk/sk/necro to split them (then go lay in the
corner so they don't fuck with agro).  Faster kill rate than 2 groups of
50-55 also. (the 2 groups complained that we were pulling too fast..."You
try to care, but fail!")

Hell, a crazy 60 druid (like me) can solo the bank (including that assmaster
Captain Bvellos if charm doesn't break) for armor.
