The hardest PH to spot is "a mountain giant hillock" in the sw. "a Burnyai
miner" in the nw would be hard to spot, were it not for the capital B (well
done Verant).
Speaking of FM, the original poster might want to see if Varithryx in the nw
corner has spawned, or spawn him. Should be a walkover since i think hes
about level 28. Drops a nice ac16 +charisma arm piece (sleeves of the
ancient). I think the straw spun belt and lumberjacks cap outdo banded for
armor class.
