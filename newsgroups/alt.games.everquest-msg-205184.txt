Chain decreases movement speed -and- attack speed at the same time, and is one
of the all time great bard songs.  It stacks with everything, although only
insomuch as it puts the icon on; if there's a better snare that will be in
effect, if there's a better slow that will be in effect, neither of these
effects is in itself additive (you dont slow twice as much, you slow best out
of all slows on the target, same with snare)

Since chain is both snare and slow, you generally put it on the mob at the
start of the fight and leave it on till the mob is dead; if the mob aggros to a
caster its snared, if there's a caster slowing and slow wears off its still
slowed a bit, when it gets around to running its snared... unless you are in a
good group with a snarer and slower that are completely on top of things,
there's rarely a case where you don't keep chains on a mob thats being killed.

The "slowing down the killing" thing is worth a seperate discussion.  For this
you need to look at how much damage is being done by the DS compared to your
groups other damage output, and how to what extent healing is eating up mana.
As a general rule I think people will tell you the mob is better slowed
regardless of your DS situation unless you are being powerleveled.

As an aside, if you -are- using a DS plan, bard DS stacks with other DS (potion
and buff and cleric) and can really boost the DS output of a group quite a bit.
