Aye. If agreed on beforehand everyone can roll on everything. Whether they
decide to let a groupmate have a valuable item (for whatever reason) is a
personal choice. I will normally let the other person have it. I know I've
been on the recieving end of these kinds of situations and I just like the
good Karma it generates.

I also HATE buying and selling stuff. I play the game to quest or fight my
way into good items. I SoW and TP for free, give away my extra goodies and
am seriously untwinked. I'm level 50 and have about 130pp in the bank.

I'm not saying I won't do it. I've sold my share of Hero Bracers in order to
buy my JM Stick and a few player-made items. But sitting in that tunnel
auctioning stuff, dealing with the hagglers, beggars and d00dz is not my
idea of a good time.
