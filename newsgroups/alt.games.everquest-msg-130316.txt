I didn't parse the logs - the warrior did, using
some realtime log parser and EQW to pop out and
check it.

What I do know is that he was seriously chagrined
over how much the pet outdamaged him.  It's possible
he wasn't swinging for part of some fights - as he 
was dual boxing a cleric.  But it couldn't have
been much, as the mobs rarely moved once the ranger
got them back to camp.

Across many fights the pet consistently outdamaged
the ranger, from level 41ish elemental warriors
(where the pet had the largest margin - 5 or 6
DPS) all the way up to the 53 rock.  No spell haste,
FBSS, Jagged Sword of Mourning (13/26?) main hand,
LSoEE off hand.  The DS lost serious ground on the
warriors/crusaders, as the warrior's DPS was 
significantly better.  But against the rock, the 
warrior's DPS dropped off tremendously - he may
still have been 44 at the time, he dinged in that
play session.  The pet was a 56 hitter (level 45),
and the ranger is VERY good about getting the pet
on the back and keeping it there.  At the same
time, the ranger only had 1000ish AC at the time
(he has since boosted it quite a bit - I think
he's pushing 1100 now when he's raid buffed.)
and got hit so much against rock golems that we
teased him mercilessly about being a mana sink.
When a mob is hitting you that often, a DS racks
up serious damage.\

So, no I am not sure that those numbers were
accurate to the last decimal place, but they
are definitely in the ball park and put paid
to the notion that mages are not of tremendous use
in any XP group, far more so than a wizard, due
to the sustainability of the damage.  And it is
on that basis that I say that mage's are not 
broken pre 55, and the meager overall damage 
boost given by innate criticals is nothing more
than eye candy, and is so far from unbalancing
as to make some people's claims (Rthen Majere,
Goishen and others on the caster's realm boards
to name names) of its being over powered utterly 
laughable, and a poor reflection on the mage 
community in general.
