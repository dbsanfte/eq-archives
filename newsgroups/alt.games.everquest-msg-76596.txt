For what it's worth, potters can make most items and pottery is usually
cheaper and easier to rise.  Pot for rabbit/veggie stew trivials at 56.
Cookie cutters: 102, pie tin/cake round 115, muffin tin 122.

You might be able to find  a potter in EC who will make you what you need
too.

And I'd start at something a bit lower than fish rolls.

Good luck,
Raven

and
