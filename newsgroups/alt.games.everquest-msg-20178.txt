	Roleplay also let members of the guild know in which zone I am
hunting; anon does not.  That zone info allows my guildmates, who know
my class and (at least approxiamtely) my level, to know how long it
may take me to get to them from my hunting grounds.  

	When asked politely for a SoW or res by anyone, I provide what
I can or explain why I cannot.
