Yeah, the system doesn't have to be all that GREAT really.
There are threads about this over at the EQW site.

What people do is set up the eq w inis, with two folders and two eq
folders or something, to open up each window right on top of each
other. So if it was 10 10 position for the first one you'd have it the
same for second.  In one or both you don't have luclin models,
preferrably both, and in one you have the sound off (in game or via a
nosound.txt empty file in the eq dir)

Then they alt tab to select each seperate instance of eq at a
different time.
