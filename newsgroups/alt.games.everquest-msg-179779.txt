Ok at 10% Warrior type mobs enrage..  aka auto-riposte every attack from the
front.

With haste, tripple attack, special attacks etc, you can do 3+ attacks a
second

So every second your attacking, the AoW is riposting you for over 3000
damage.

3000/second means within 2 seconds you've just killed virtually every rogue,
monk, whoever else was meleeing

And yes, making him turn was psyically turning him around.. you fight AoW in
a corner, with his back to everybody except the MA
