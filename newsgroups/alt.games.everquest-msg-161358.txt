What, no tips for the noob?

Man, this is one HUMONGO world now. They either sped up the zoning or my
computer is just one hell of a lot faster than it was in those days, zoning
is a snap now.

Got any recommendations for a good Piercing weapon for a 21 Barb Shammy? I
plan to do some research on the EQ sites later tonight and see if I can find
some interesting quests for decent items for my guy. I'm not convinced I'm
going to be able to find a lot of groups my age, so I may have to limit
myself to solo-able quests or else buy something at the Bazaar.
