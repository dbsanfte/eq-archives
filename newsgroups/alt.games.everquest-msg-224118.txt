Are you putting a 10ac aug in there or si that a typo? If it isn't I'd
probably go with the +7 cold/fire/magic resist aug for the type 1 slot
(remember they've been nerfed from 3/2/2 to 3/2/1 now) The reason I'd do
that is if you're going to be raiding at the elemental level, plate
molds are relatively common (note the relatively) and elemental armor
even for clerics has ungodly high ac, which puts us well past our soft
cap. I'm currently at 1608 buffed with elemental arms, gloves, boots and
a bracer and the 66 ac Mail of Judgement and I didn't notice much
difference from the 1490 or so I had before we entered the elemental
planes. We still take hits like a druid, rather than an actual plate
wearing class and I doubt that would change even if we topped 2000 ac.
