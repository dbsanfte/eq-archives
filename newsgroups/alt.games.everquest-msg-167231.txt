That's part of it.  Notice the threads asking about "a safe place to
solo for a level N Xxxxxx"?  There seem to be a lot of players for
whom "safe" exp is the absolute priority.

*shrug*  It seems to me that life on a red server might be exciting
but it would surely be far more frustrating.  I don't think I'm alone
in seeing the de facto requirement to band together with other players
pretty much all the time as a serious infringement on my liberty to
play when, where, and how I see fit.  Of course, that perception has
kept me from spending any significant time on a red server, so all I
see clearly is the down-side, never having experienced the up.
