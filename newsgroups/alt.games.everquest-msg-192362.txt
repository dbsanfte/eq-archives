People often misunderstand SK pets, they are not meant to tank for a whole
fight like a Necro pet, and they are never going to tank down any exp giving
mobs but then again your an Shadowknight not an Necromancer so why should it
?

What SK pets can do however are ...

Act as one of the longest duration DoT's you have (if you use them right
they should last for many fights)
Give you one more chance of stunning that fleeing mob
Buy you a few seconds to step back and cast a spell without being hit

One of the major disadvantages of the SK pet is its often sucidal habits.
As the only Plate class with FD, SK's can often find themselves pulling, but
even leaving the pet on guard mode often results in it jumping into the fray
to soon leaving the SK with no other option than to wait for the little guy
to snuff it (and praying that nothing adds along the way) which gets
annoying fast.

I find them best suited to soloing, or if someone else is pulling in a group
but alot of people write them off totally which is a mistake IMHO but each
to their own.
