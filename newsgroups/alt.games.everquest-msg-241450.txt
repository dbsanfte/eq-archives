Shadowknights get pets too, but nobody considers them a "pet class".

I think it's somewhat of a judgement call. Shaman don't get their
pet until their 30s, and the pet isn't strong enough to tank blue
mobs.  It's just a nice added bonus.  Unlike Necromancers or Mages,
who generally depend heavily on their pets.
