Yes, although weapon skills will also go up against deep red
mobs that kill you and take away experience.   At least if you
can get in a swing or two before you die, that is.

Mobs that don't give experience if you kill them won't trigger
weapon skill increases, although they can trigger other types
of skill increases (such as Beg, IIRC.)
