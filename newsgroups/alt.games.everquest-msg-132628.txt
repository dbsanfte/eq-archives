General rules of thumb:

 - Under level 30:

You want to put your fastest weapon in your off hand. Regaurdless of whether
or not it's your best ratio weapon.
This not only helps with the speed at which your dual wield skills up but
will increase your over all damage in a complete combat.

- Level 30 and over:

At this point you are going to want to move your fastest weapon, regaurdless
if it's your best ratio weapon, into your primary slot. At this point you
start to receive a damage bonus off your weapons. You only receive the
damage bonus off your primary hand. So, to take advatage of the damage
bonus, you place your faster weapon in your primary hand.

Note:

When choosing between more than 2 weapons use the weapons ratio (the damage
devided into the delay) to cut your choices down to 2. Taking the best 2
ratio weapons.

(I got this from someone a while back, and can't remeber for the life of me
who to give credit to)
