The most difficult thing about playing a bard in a group is NOT the
constant hitting of keys its deciding what effects to bestow on the
group. Since a bard can do almost everything to some degree but is
limited to only 4 at any given time, the decisions he makes affects
the outcome greatly. Put it another way how many players Ive ever
grouped with have any idea what a good bard can do? 1 in 20 at best
and they have bard alts. 

Without doubt the most difficult class to master on a daily basis
simply due to the sheer number of options open to the class. Now solo
and even raid its much easier since you are working with a know set of
conditions. If you want this kind difficulty play a bard . 

Druids and Necros are perhaps the only other classes even coming close
to this kind of flexibility but since they use manna they are limited.

To give you an idea here are some of the various roles bards can fill
well, although seldom best its almost always enough:

Melee - plate class, about 60% of warrior damage, can hold agro
Puller - speed buffs , invis, lev, charm pulling, lull songs, can cast
while moving, Track 
Healer - Regen type only
Manna Regen
Magic damage - Dot, AoE, DD
Buffer - AC , Haste , Damage shields, Resists, ect, etc
DeBuffer - slow , snare, resist , AC, on and on
Crowd control - Second only to chanters and not really by much since
they are never oom unless swarm kiting.

The list is long and is only limited by your imagination. Now consider
its possible but not likely to do all those things on the same pull )
