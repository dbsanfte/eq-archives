Well, they are referring to the usefulness after level 30.  The song absolutely 
does not work on mobs after level 30.  It is very effective at level 15 though.  
I was able to wade into certain camps with that song playing and mez the entire 
camp, allowing my group to kill mobs one at a time.  Before they changed the 
resists on it, it was useful on mobs beyond level 30.  
I suspect they wanted bards to learn to use the single-target mez, and since 
there is a 3-4 level overlap in effectiveness, it works pretty well.
