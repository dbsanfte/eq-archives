As a bard I was able to kill one at 35 but it was a pain, very time
consuming
running around with only one targetable DOT and Chants put me too
close so that I got hit a lot and had to keep hymn running instead.

On the other hand I could readily kill two or three or four in a row, and
just chant down the last one by charm kiting.  Hill Giants are much
better at killing other Hill giants than bards are.  Turned out this too
was a waste of my time, since I have the funds available to a 59 cleric
the 15pp per HG average wasn't important to me, and finding several
unoccupied HG in a row was too time consuming in a "Kills per hour"
sort of way. While I could usually find -one- HG, finding a second with
the first one on my tail was annoying, and then I'd either have to lead
them
both out of the HG area or suffer annoying giant skeleton adds which
made everthing even more tedious.  Even when I finished one there would
be that same long search for a third or else I'd have to kill the first
and
start all over, also very time consuming.  I suppose if I could find a
good
no-adds kiting area -near- the HGs, and went there at a time when HG
were relatively unmolested, it would have been decent exp, but as it
turns out I did six or eight trying several variations, then lit out to
the far more enjoyable Dawnshroud.
