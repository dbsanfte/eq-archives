Don't recall seeing rats. Only snakes were level 3-5. I don't think
there were any decaying skeles, but there were regular ones. Even the
lower level kobolds are gone, lowest ones being somewhere around level
5. There are bunches of crab spiderlings (which I swear I saw a few
blue at level 2) and the bleeder larvea I mentioned, though (Pretty
sure most of them were blue at 2, too).
