DT,

A few people stiffing me over buffs became a few people a day stiffing me
became it not worth my time to sell KEI any more, because it was more
effective to go out and actually earn my plat (as you put it).  And now I
only KEI guildies (for free of course) and every time I see people screaming
that nobody is selling KEI in Tranq, it's music to my ears.

Be careful before you decide stiffing is no big deal.
