Mostly.   The random mobs that are tagged "see everything" as part of the
Shroud of Stealth nerf can see through normal invis, even without buffing
themselves.  They're the ones where you get a "You suspect this creature can
see you" message when you con them.  They're (almost?) always roamers, and
can be literally anywhere.    My level 65 Rogue with Shroud of Stealth found
a level 35 spider in Kaesora who was able to see me...
