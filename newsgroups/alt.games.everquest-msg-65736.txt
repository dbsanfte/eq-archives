I had the same problem last night.  I looked fine on my screen and even on
my brother's screen, but everyone else said I looked rat-sized.  I recast
the spell on myself and they said I looked normal.  Must be a graphics
bug.

On a side note, I can't express the joy I felt when I found that I finally
look like I'm sitting now in Wolf -form (when sitting).  And I no longer
run like a trotting horse.  And I don't look just like every other druid
in thier ACME "one-size and one-style fits all" wolf-form outfits.  It was
like getting a new spell =)
