I am arguing simply from the stand point of being logical and consistancy.
Damage is damage. What difference does it make how the damage is
applied? As I said melee damage stacks, as do nukes. Combining
most classes in a group doubles, triples, etc the damage/minute.

Yes necros are excellent soloers. I mean they have a tank, they have snare,
fear, mez, nukes, dots, mana regen. Hard to not be powerful. Except
when grouped together they did not 'stack' well with each other, same with
shaman and druid dots as well.

A necro solo was king. 2 necros grouped was actually less efficient
than both going solo. Doesn't make sense.
