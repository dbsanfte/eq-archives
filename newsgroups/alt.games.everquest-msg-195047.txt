So a level 65 character has

2730+ (wis-200)*6 + mana from gear, more or less

If not at the cap, figuring 6 mana per wis lets you compare two pieces of
gear fairly easily.  Something to watch for is your wisdom cap, under 61 it
won't go over... was it 230?  At any rate, the cap goes up 5 points per
level, plus you can raise it further with AAs.  If you are near the cap
without a buff, KEI will likely put you over it, meaning that some of the
wis on your gear is giving you 0 extra mana.  In this case, mana gear is
more generally useful, even if you potentially get more mana from the wisdom
on a different item for the same slot.

Of course 4000 mana more or less is a far cry from the 220 mana for the 10
wizard, but its all part of the same formula.  I'm also casting mostly
spells that cost 400 mana a pop, so I can cast 10 times or so before going
OOM, depending on what that wizard is casting he may end up doing better
than I am!

Mana pool isn't the only thing to consider; also (maybe more) important
would be focus items that reduce the cost of a spell or improve its
effectiveness.  Saving 10% on a cast (or getting 10% more effect) is like
having 10% deeper pool -and- regenerating the mana 10% faster (you get 90
mana back faster than 100 mana back)
