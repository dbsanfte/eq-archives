While it will help, the warrior will be running around with a pretty crappy dex, unless while picking up KEI for
the cleric you also make a point of getting focus for the warrior, probably a good idea anyway, nice long duration
and stacks with cleric buffs.

Skyfire can be solo meleed by the cleric in her 40s, no need to wait till 50s especially with a warrior partner;
single pullable mobs that really don't hit all that hard or fast.  The exp pales on a per mob basis compared to
dungeon zones or POP especially, but there's the chance of pearlescent fragments dropping which the cleric will
need eventually for her epic.

Splendid
