Yeah, what about it?  What about "That damn mother who (as she stated later,

and stood by doing nothing?

Only because she doesn't want to blame herself for ignoring the signs, and
her lawyer who wants an even more fat pocketbook, advises her to blame deep
pockets Sony.

Warning sign #1.  Even if she didn't know automatically that it was the

Just like other entertainment selling companies add features their customers

What about those of us who BENIFIT from spending so much time at our

Thats less than 3 hours a day, maybe say 2 hours a day on work days, 5 hours
a day on weekends.  Or even 1.5 hours a day on work days, and 6.25 hours a
day on weekends.  How does this compare to athletic events, watching TV, or
other hobbies, including the LESS socialable ones (ones you primarily do
solo, or can't interact or communicate well while doing)?

So when does Compaq, HP, Dell, or Gateway, or any other computer

daily shower, so electricutes themselves by taking a bath with their
computer?

Based on my (personal) experience, psychologists TRY to make people sound
like they need more psychiatric help, that way they get more money off of
it.  THEY often feed their patients problems, or simply don't progress
enough to correct them, often times denying something due to the risk that
it might actually help the patient, therefore ending some of their ongoing
pay.

Damages of porn sites can be arguable, and off topic here, so I'll not
comment on that.  But chatting with people you meet online as bad?  Some of
us don't have much other option.  I've talked with 5 people over long time
online relationships over the past 2 years.  2 of them for over a year
straight (others left due to moving & not having Internet access for a long
enough time, mostly due to having been using their college's computers).  In
person, I've only had 2 people I really talk to often.  And I met both of
them at work, a situation you can hardly avoid.  The relationship with my
sisters and I has almost ONLY been online, and depends on it enough to the
point where I built an almost $2,000 computer system for them this past
summer.  And they speak of online communication as a bad thing?

So you'd rather have them on the streets, causing problems there, than
taking out the agression or spending time online where they are getting into
LESS trouble?  Are you the same one who votes for leaving murders and
rapists on the streets for as long as you can, secretly hoping they commit
the crime again so you can find something to blame (other than THEM), while
sending the victims to be locked up in mental hospitals?  You must be part
of this "great american government"?  The ones who take the child from the
abusive father and put them in another home, banning communication from
their family, while leaving the abuser right where he is...then after
punnishing the victim, and rewarding the problem causer, then wonder why the
victim thinks it's their fault?

Well as long as they actually DO help people, it would be good to have the

So you're saying that EverQuest INVENTED peer pressure?  If someone is going
to give in to their peers that easilly, better to spend a little more time
online, than do a little more drugs, drink just a little more, vandalize
another property, hurt or kill another person, or anything else that could
get them in worse trouble.  If you want to remove peer presure, then don't
waste time attacking what is being used, get the person enough help to learn
to say "enough" and not give in.  Like I said, if they give into their peers
on EverQuest upon demand, what chances do they have elsewhere?

But she let him continue with it, again more proof she didn't care as much
as she says she does.  Your son has medical problems, so being a "loving

So now they're saying it's not only the mother who noticed but did NOT care,

So now you're saying that they did attempt to get to him.  How far did you

Simple...PUT THE COMPUTER IN YOUR ROOM, OR ONE YOU CAN CONTROL!  When I was
younger, and would get grounded from video games, I'd lose the WHOLE game
system, not just the controllers.  That way I COULD NOT play when I was not
allowed to.

There was your chance to charge him with credit card fraud, and get the
judge to require some form of help for him (since he obviously wouldn't be
mentally fit for prison, and such a minor charge anyway only being his
parents' credit card...better to stop the problem when you've got the
chance).

But this addiction they say caused the problems, THEY ALLOWED him to
continue to have.  How many drug re-hab centers supply drugs or alcohol for
their residents?  What were they doing supplying him an internet connection?
They could deny broadband, and talk with a technician or the pone company
about a way to cause enough problem on the phone line to prevent a modem
connection, but not hender phone usage.  Or if needed, simply deny the phone
line completely (let him use a cell phone, or cordless phone with the base
in another location so he couldn't connect to EverQuest with it?

Prove mental instability (or at least TRY)?  Get a court order to have him
committed to your care or the care of someone who CAN and WILL prevent the
return to what you consider his problem?

If he was really that bad, why not have the councelor come to him?  And
again, why was he allowed to be on his own anyway if he really is in as much
danger as they belive?  Get the help first, then once he is COMPLETELY
cured, then if he is able to handle himself, let him out on his own (even
with some supervision if needed).

That's correct...why didn't you or someone close to him (or at least someone

Are you saying that you expect people to come on their own?  Your son had
people coming to HIM and HE DID NOT DO ANYTHING! What makes you think that
if he won't allow others to help him, that he'd go looking for help himself?

You did sit there, you did some, but you didn't do more.  You saw the signs
early, you had him in your care but let him continue his addiction, YOU LET
HIM DIE!
    I'm waiting on a similar situation to happen, and then the company being
sued to turn and counter-sue the parents (or who ever) as well as charge
THEM with negligense, and possibly some form of accedental (if not
intentional) murder for allowing someone to continue their addiction until
they finally kill themselves over it.  I know it sounds crazy, but not as
crazy as putting the blame on the entertainment provider as a way to clear
your concience of what you allowed to happen.

We are idiots!
