Since I'll be starting anew on Venril Sathir and want to use 2
accounts, I was just wondering what people thought were the best class
combinations that would be able to reach the 50s initially and if
possible, reach 60.

A combination with either a shaman or enchanter in the group is what
I'm really interested in, so another class suggestion that complements
either one would be most welcome.

Failing that though, any effective 2 class group idea would be
interesting to hear.

Many thanks in advance to any/all replies.
