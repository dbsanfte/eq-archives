Just dinged 15 with my wood elf ranger hunting in Everfrost.  Had already
made the trip to Surefall to buy my spells, so upon dinging I trucked to
Halas to get 'em out of the bank.

After scribing and memming, I start buffing myself.  Feet Like Cat,
Thistlecoat, Skin Like Wood, and Camoflage.  Stay with me .. there's a
question in a minute. <g>

I reach for the door to the bank, and inadvertently con the merchant in the
bank.  He's now Indifferent to me (I assume due to the Camoflage ... last
time I checked he was Apprehensive).  After seeing this, I run upstairs to
Cappi McTarnigal ... I'm indifferent to him now as well.  Hmmmmmm .....

There are a few quests I'd like to complete for experience and faction that
I haven't been able to get due to being a wood elf in Halas.  Also, the guy
I group with (a Barb Shaman) gets better prices than I do when selling off
due to faction.

Here it comes ..... Question Ho!

Can I turn in quest items and transact business with the merchants while
Camoflaged, or is it like hiding ... once you do something you're no longer
hidden?

Thanks for sticking it out to the end of the post!

Crash
