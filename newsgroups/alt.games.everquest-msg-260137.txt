You might want to stop at ring 8, as 9 is where they start taking a great
deal of time.  8'th ring has the same clicky as 9, just worse stats.   But
at this point in EQ's mudflation, you can easily get dropped rings with
better stats than the 9'th ring, with much less work.

It's not really a matter of trust, or of not wanting to help.   The
encounter has just become unbalanaced by later additions to the game.  Not
in terms of risk vs. reward, but in terms of time invested vs reward.

I think ring wars take a good 4 hours to complete, but we'll call it 3 in
case my memory is a bit off.   Doing the ring war for 10 people will result
in 10 nice rings... but it will take a full 30 hours over several days.   If
the same group of people put those 30 hours into something like killing Sol
Ro minis 4-5 times... they'll end up with full suits of ornate armor, and
about fourty nice items, with stats better than the 10'th ring.   Including
a 115hp +15 atk ring among them.  (10'th ring has 100 hp and no attack,
IIRC).

Its things like that that make it hard to drum up support for Coldain Ring
Wars.  Everyone that can easily do them has much better options for the
time.  Promises to pay them back by helping with thier ring later don't mean
much, when they see the 10'th ring war alone as being not worth the time...
even when they are the beneficiary.
