I am having terrible problems with the new patches since Tuesday.  In
order to become compliant, I have made lots of upgrades to the system.
I am only having problems in Everquest.  Unreal Tournament, Deus Ex,
Tony Hawk Pro Skater, etc. all run fine.  In Everquest my framerates
are so slow that it is hard to play (nvidia driver 15.24) or I crash
to the desktop repeatedly while in game.  Usually about 3-5 after I
get in game.  Sometimes as quick as 30 seconds.  

I have an HP Pavilion 9694C. 

I have upgraded ram to 256mb, the TNT2 video card to a PNY GeForce 3
Ti 200, the sound card to a SoundBlaster Audigy Gamer Sound Card.  I
have removed the coexant combo modem/sound card, the old video card
(duh), the lucent wildwire dsl card, and the old network card  I
upgraded about 4 months ago due to a lightning strike.  

According to the motherboard spec, the machine has an AMD-751 chipset.
I have seen a number of people recommending running a via 4in1 driver
update and others recommending an acapi update?   Are these applicable
to my computer?

I have ran windows update and updated anything that remotely makes
sense.  I have downloaded all of the patches from hp for the 9694c
including the bios, firmware, cdrw drive, keyboard, etc.  The nvidia
15.24 geforce drivers don't crash me to the desktop but perform very
slowly.  I have tried the 21.83 and the 23.11 versions which perform
better but crash me to the desktop.  

Any suggestions would be appreciate.
