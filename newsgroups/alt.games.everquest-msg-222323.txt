The original edict there is "An ye harm none, do what thou
wilt".  Mr Crowley got cute and made his own "devils rule" by
simply (and explicitly, thus the "whole of the law" part) leaving
out the first bit, providing a handy defining difference between
a white witch and a black one.

Heh, good point, but I'm afraid I personally am not a true
atheist.  I call myself an agnostic atheist; I'd like to believe
that there is no god, but without proof, I can't be sure.

My point here is that regardless of whether you believe in a god
or not, doing something because you fear punishment isn't moral
behaviour, nor is doing something because you hope for reward. 
Rather, doing it because its right, no matter what the
consequences, thats moral.  Abraham (thus tagging three seperate
major religions at once) was right out of bounds when he went
along with God's demand that he kill his son for him, and the
fact that God later said "only joking!" doesn't change that for
me.  I think killing your child just to satisfy some all powerful
practical joker is right out.  Apparantly 70% of the world
disagrees with me on that, though.
