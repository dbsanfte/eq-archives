  Well, if you're using the new graphics models, then all the old armor is
necessarily going to have to look a little different because the old armor
textures probably wouldn't look right if they were just wrapped around the
new character models.  However, from what I've seen in the screenshots, some
of the character models seem to be sporting clothing which appears very
similar to armors we already have.  So my guess would be that most
characters, aside from their different "shape", will appear to be attired
more or less the same as they looked pre-Luclin.
