No, I doubt they'll remove the weight limit; that seems to be part
of the "flavor" they want monks to have.  Get yourself some weight
reducing bags (preferably 85% or even 100% WR) and learn to throw
away copper pieces. :-)  [Actually, since I'm a greedy monk, I keep
a stack of batwings on me.  At CHA 104 or better they sell to NPCs
for 2gp a stack, and can be bought back at the same price, except
the purchase spends 200cp if I have it.  So I can convert 200cp to
2gp as many times as necessary.  Of course, in a group, you can just
get someone else to carry the loot.]

Anyway, the AC mitigation refers to a change that got made during PoP,
in which raising your AC above a certain point (1300 or so, I think)
has almost no effect on your chance of getting hit -- if you're a monk.
Other melee classes get much more benefit from AC over 1300 than monks
do.

Since you started your monk only recently, I doubt your AC is high
enough for you to have run into this effect.
