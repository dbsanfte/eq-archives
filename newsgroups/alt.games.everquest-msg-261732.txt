just out of curiosity, have you guys (the ones having problems with the 9800 
pro) downloaded the newest DX9 and ati drivers?
i too am thinking about buying this card, and so far the love it/hate it 
ratio is about 50/50.  i see the posts in this newsgroup and just about 
everyone says the performance sucks.
yet in my guilds message board, its almost unanomously (sp?) viewed as 
running the game flawlessly.  im just trying to figure out why theres so 
much deviation within the responses.
