You would assume wrong.

Mobs carry a number of self buffs, and are often buffed by other mobs.
Often its a good idea to -remove- those buffs.  This is what the cancel
magic line is for, to strip buffs off your target.  It can also be used
to remove a few nasty icon effects from yourself or others.

Since Cancel (et al) works in this multipurpose function, it can be cast
on literally anyone.  And it takes both good and bad icons away, since
it is used to strip "good" icons off your target, and to strip "bad" icons

off your buddies.

Used imprudently, you will find yourself stripping the "bad" icons your
teammates have placed on the mob while trying to get the "good" ones
off it, or stripping the "good" icons off your teammates while trying to
get rid of that "bad" one.

It seems that the person in question was deliberately doing this to the
mob our hero was fighting, stripping it of snares and DOTs.

One way to combat this would be to go in to options and turn on
spell effect messages, then get close enough to see the "Ice giant feels
dispelled" message.  Send -that- in in a report and you might get
some responce.

If this was happening repeatedly, a good GM would come in with
GM Invis on ( thats an invis that see invis doesnt see thru, and also
the GM doesn't show on a /who for the zone ) and watch.  Simple
enough to see Badass casting a spell, Ice Giant Dispelled, and also
to observe a snared mob suddenly breaking into a headlong rush.

This direct violation of even the rediculously pro-gank PnP should be
enough for a soul mark and warning if not some instant time out.  If
the player has multiple soul marks, could even be booted from the
game.

Of course a sensible jerk (if thats not an oxymoron) would do this
just the once... knowing full well that you probably won't have the
options up to get the messages, and certainly no way to get a GM
in to watch him do it.  GMs won't do anything without witnessing
the acts in question, so by not repeating their misdeeds, the jerks
of norrath can walk off scot free.

And you thought Blue Servers were totally Care Bear?
