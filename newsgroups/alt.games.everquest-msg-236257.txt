Perhaps. The mornometer, however, is +-.0000001 accurate, and you have it 
pegged.

And yet you expect it of EQ?

Granted. The move away from large mainframes and towards server farms has 
also helped, as has the reliance on "appliance"-type systems for things 
like NFS.

Google is one iteration of the same thing. EQ is effectively a google for 
each server. Google is platform independent and uses non-proprietary 
protocols for client interface. EQ has their own proprietary protocols and 
clients, all of which must work on a myriad of hardware configs and at the 
same time remain in-step with a server that is 1ms-1000ms away. Google has 
basically hacked the application directly into the Linux kernel. EQ is an 
application that sits on top of a kernel. Stability is inherently more 
feasible in google for the same reason it is easier to keep a DNS cache up 
than an MTA.

I can't help but notice you skipped my question about your network. Do I 
assume correctly you are talking out your ass?
