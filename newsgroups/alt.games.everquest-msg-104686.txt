More than "keep him alive while I med" its "keep him alive while this
takes-forever-and-isn't-made-faster-by-the-focus Cheal is inbound
but he's taken a couple lucky shots and isn't going to make it"

Single leading cause of MA death is noone standing ready to keep
the MA alive while waiting for the CHeal.  If you see that HP bar
moving down under the one bubble mark its time to -do- something
cause there's nothing the cleric can do to speed things up besides
scream at his too slow cast bar.  If the CHeal hits before your heal
goes off you can always duck to cancel it and save the mana.
