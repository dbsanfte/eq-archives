    Do you keep Annul up at all times, and if so what stops you from
Annuling the Manaskin, then Defluxing?

    The epic itself is pretty slow, as rogue weapons go - 15/25. It's the
intrinsic haste on it that makes it seem fast. A common rogue weapon like
Tombcarver has a 17 delay. (A rogue fresh from a good trip to Kaesora would
come out with a 5/17 and a 7/20 weapon.)

    I've noticed in duels in Butcherblock, say, that snakes and bats will
attack people in a duel, even if those people are level 50. Seems to be
triggered by melee combat. Have you seen this on RZ - normally non-aggro
mobs jumping into a fight? With my "Go out, do the laundry, order a pizza,
come back before it finishes casting" cleric nuke, any add has a chance of
interrupting me.

    Depends which of your characters you chose to play. You'd quickly find
that the average player level is higher than RZ, and the average gear level
would be better. Since zones are much more crowded, you'd also find more
people "adding" in fights. That having been said, though.... you'd find a
steady stream of tanks at all levels wearing little to no resist gear, and
mostly Kunark class armour. And in EC, well, they're nice enough to /auction
"WTS all on me at first torch, class X gear!" Get out the WIZ and ready
those AoEs. ;-)

    Another thing you'd need to deal with on a server like mine, at your
level: MANY more epic-equipped and Velious-equipped folks, meaning higher
resist levels for people that are in No Drop gear. Epics alone are 50 points
of resists - that's like a Blue Diamond piece that can't be looted after
death.
