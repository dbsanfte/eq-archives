You are being a prude.  Why oh why would an evil character named Lusafir be
disturbing when one of the all time best selling computer games is Diablo?
          Since I am one of those anti religious types (don't read anti god)
isn't Lusafir (Lucifer) like in the Bible as sort of a bad guy fallen angel
type.  I mean he is on Xena anyway which is the basis for much of my
religious training.
      This is a fantasy "role - playing" game right?   I guess what I am
saying is even to someone who buys the  whole religious thing how and why
would it be offensive.  I mean I have seen and read religious books movies
and plays and somebody sometimes has to play the devil for good to prevail
over.  I don't get it?

Bunboy,
    The people who can smile when things go wrong have found someone else to
blame.
