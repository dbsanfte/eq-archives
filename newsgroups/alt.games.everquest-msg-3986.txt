He he. Yeah. And he's got less than two days /played so far, too. If I
had more time to play and didn't keep switching back to my monk, he'd be
in his twenties already. I think it's mostly a combination of my
pathetic attempts at twinking him, some nice gifts from random
strangers, and the fact that I've taken two other characters past those
levels already so I knew a few good places for loot and xp. Well, that
and a ton of good advice and strategy guides from here and various web
sites.
