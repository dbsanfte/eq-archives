The US saved the UK's ass?

I'd say more accurately that the US contributed to the eventual victory of
the Allied forces. What if Hitler had won in Russia? What if Stalin had
capitulated? What if one or two battles had gone differently for the
Germans? It's entirely possible that, at that point, you would have been
fighting a losing cause.

Anyone who thinks that the US "saved the world" from the Nazis really needs
to brush up on their history. It was a combination of the defeats suffered
in Russia, the extensive losses by the Afrikakorps, the Europeans who were
already fighting against Hitler and the Americans. Take any one of those
factors out, and suddenly history is different.
