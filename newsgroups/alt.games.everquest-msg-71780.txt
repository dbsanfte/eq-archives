Hey all,

Looking for some advice here. I have tried to get to FV alot recently.
REALLY wanna go to LOIO with the rest of my guild, but i cant seem to get on
the boat in TD. I get on the shuttles in BB. wait forever for em to take
off, then hit the zone. Zoning lasts about 3 minutes. When i come to in TD
the shuttles are already headed back to BB. With me on it!. Someone told me
there is a ramp you have to get on to board the boat. But honestly. i have
no clue. i have enough time to turn and look all the way around once before
i zone to BB again. Any suggestions on how to get to FV? Besides running
through DL( did that once... never again... well not till lvl 38 or so)?
Thanks in advance
