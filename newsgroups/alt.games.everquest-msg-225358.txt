Thats not two healers, thats no healers.

A paladin's AE heals are great for countering AE damage.  But thats used in
concert with a real healer.  Aside from that... if, as you say below, he was
up front doing damage and tanking... even if he did cast an AE heal, you
were probably out of range of it.

And a 53 ranger, with Greater heal (300 damage... (do you even have it at
that level?)) is not going to be doing anything against Ragefire's 400
damage per tick AE.
