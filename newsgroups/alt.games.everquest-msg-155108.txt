Logged this morning and downloaded new spell effect files.  Pull out my
wizard, and noticed that her lightning spell wasn't sending a comet acorss
the sky.  Then logged the druid and hit a few IGs ... was getting the effect
for the magic based spells, but not Breath of Ro.

Anyone else notice this?  Just wondering ... :-)
