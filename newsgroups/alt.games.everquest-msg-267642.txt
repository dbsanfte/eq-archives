I love my room - as my character is progressing, so is my room's
contents.

As I get richer, there are more expensive decorations.

As I become a better artisan, I'm adding custom decorations (latest
was a tin sconce - a wall mounted candle holder - looked very nice
underneath a large painting).

And I complete quests, I'm adding other items - just 2 books so far,
but I've heard of a decorative halberd, when you complete the Gnoll
Mastery quest.

In a few levels, I'll be strong enough to do Guild Quests, which will
unlock even more items I can buy from specialist sellers.

>Do I have to have one ?

Nope, unless you want to be a vendor.

That's ridiculous - rent is 5s a week, and if you haven't got a spare
5s at the end of the first week, you're badly mismanaging your money.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
