It is not at all clear to me that tradeskills are actually balanced
that way.  Banded armor and reinforced leather have trivials close to
100.  Are they appropriate for level 20 characters?  I can get the
drops that I need earlier than that, for the leather (HQ pelts).  I
started playing only around PoP.  What was the average level to wear
banded armor "back in the day" (pre-Kunark)?  For a tradeskiller, it
seems reasonable to say, if you can get the materials yourself, you can
make it.  For the non-tradeskillers, it is less obvious.  Happily,
there is very little wearable crafted gear that does not require a drop
of some kind.  Jewelcraft is the obvious exception (although it
requires a certain level of enchanter to create), and armorsmithing can
only be done up to banded, using only vendor bought stuff.  Well, I
guess you can buy ornate chain supplies from vendors, but that gets
expensive REAL fast - it's better to farm fine steel.

For another example, my level 60 main is working on studded acrylia
armor, which trivals at 188 tailoring.  A level 38 character would have
a tough time gathering the needed materials.  I think it could be done,
especially if you just want a small number of pieces, and you don't
mind failing a lot until you get it.  But for skilling up, my main has
done far more than a hundred combines (I don't have my records handy),
and he's not finished yet.  At the rate a level 38 could acquire the
materials, I think I would go insane.  I already never want to see
another grimling again.  For what it's worth, my main typically hunts
in Acrylia Caverns, fills up his bags with acrylia and vendor loot, and
sells the loot.  That usually generates just enough money to buy just
enough of the needed hopper hides in the Bazaar.  This gives me an
average of one skillup for each 2-3 hour solo run.  I need around 20
skillups to reach 188 from the last thing I gained skill on.  The
effort required for an untwinked level 38 to accomplish this ... are
there guildies anywhere that giving of their time? :)  (to be fair, a
level 38 would NOT hunt in AC, but elsewhere, perhaps DSP or Tenebrous)


In summary, raising tradeskills is already somewhat limited by what you
can reasonably attain at your level.  If you insist on no bazaar
purchases, I'm not sure that the level=trivial/5 rule holds up in
practice.

That sounds reasonable.  As the crafter, I would expect all materials
to be provided.  Even if everything is vendor-bought, there seems a
qualitative difference between "here's all the stuff you need" and
"here's 50 plat".

Ask me again after I've actually tried this. :)  It requires lots and
lots of combines to get a skillup, under the EQ model of tradeskills.
It is not immediately obvious to me how much pain or expense is
required to keep the skill raised to make level-appropriate gear.  I
define level-appropriate tradeskilled gear as: you can hunt the drops
yourself from non-green mobs.

I'll admit, this seems the least defensible to me of all the ones I put
forth.

So the payoff for being the mage on a Guk run is that your guildies
will turn around and go with you on a Najena run tomorrow?  That sounds
fair.

Even if the druid was also a halfling? :P  How about gnomes, can I punt
them?  :)

Seriously, I'm glad this passes the test.  I suppose the right way to
do this is have the tailor furnish the components and have the
enchanter just cast the spell (i.e. hit "combine" in his own unique
way).

I'm not going to join this outfit as an INT caster.  I know my

On the contrary, I'm exploring whether it might be the ideal
environment for a tradeskiller.  One of my biggest gripes with modern
EQ tradeskilling is that, if the recipe doesn't trivial above 250 (or
better, above 300), no one wants it.  There just isn't a market for
most low end tradeskill products.  I want to make stuff, dangit, and I
want it to be competitive with things I can get as drops.  Maybe not
the uberest of uber, but I want it to be worth wearing, at all levels.
I am interested in exploring whether your social experiment is the
right environment for also making low end tradeskills worthwhile.  If I
had played EQ2, I would definitely have tried to have characters
(perhaps alts) whose crafting level was higher than their adventuring
level.  Being a merchant/artisan appeals to me. :)

Indeed.  Perhaps I should have said, I have no problem with this at
all.  It's always fun to say "nah, let's just go with party buffs" in a
pickup group and watch the expressions of disbelief. :)  I remember the
first time I suggested this on an LDON run, and one guy thought it was
funny.  "He says we can just go with party buffs!", expecting everyone
else to laugh me down.  And we just went.  And we all lived.  I don't
know what he thought after that.


> (item_combine_trivial < level * 5) is sounding better and beter...

I still question if that is the correct metric, but I think we disagree
on specifics, not intent.
