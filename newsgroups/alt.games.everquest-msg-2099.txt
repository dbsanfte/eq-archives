Hey Einstein, here's a thought:

Velious was _designed_. There were a set number of zones, monsters, quests
and items. These were designed and built to be ready for a specific date,
known as the 'release date'. Once these 'designed' items has been created
and the release date was approaching Verant packaged them up ready for CD
and noticed they DIDNT FILL THE ENTIRE DISC!!! So what did they do? They
filled the space with some nice, free stuff. And you are bitching about
this? And don't give me that Warrens crap. Even YOU must have noticed it has
only just gone live - 3 months after the launch of Velious.
Look at it this way: It's nigh-on impossible (and certainly a cretinous
waste of effort) to design a game with the criteria "it must fill an entire
CD". Take my word for it, it's what I do for a living. To come here and
bitch about a couple of freebies VI stuck on in the free space is
incredibly, jaw-droppingly idiotic. I can only assume you cut and pasted the
".edu" sig from somewhere.
Oh, and Lokari is female.
