Thanks largely to a media machine that continually publicises them, 
immortalizes them in print (biographies and period fiction), movies 
(both documentaries and period fiction), and cult worship making 
headlines routinely enough. They essentially have a PR crew working for 
them in the here and now.

*Individuals* generally hold more significance than groups, *especially* 
over time. Especially if their has been considerable turnover within the 
groups membership (due to dissassociation, or simply death of old age).

A good example of this would be the reputation of a prestigious military 
unit. Its very much ephemeral, and needs to be constantly reiforced for 
the current members to derive prestige from it.

Another good example is the prestige of being a Saturday Night Live cast 
alumni. Simply being a member of the cast doesn't hold nearly the 
prestige it once did.

Being remembered is not the same as retaining the level of prestige.
