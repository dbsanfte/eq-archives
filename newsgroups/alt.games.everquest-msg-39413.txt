Since we are sharing....

I was tasked with acquiring the CS portal spell for a druid friend of
mine.  While in the tower I asked if he had the WL spell yet and since
he didn't offered to pick it up as well.  He said it wasn't important,
but he really wanted the CS one.  When I tried to buy the WL spell after
clicking to buy the CS spell I was told I didn't have enough room for
it, so sold something and picked up the WL spell.  When I met my friend
and went to give him the spells I found only the WL spell.  Seems I
missed the no inventory message when I 'thought' I had bought the spell
he really wanted.
