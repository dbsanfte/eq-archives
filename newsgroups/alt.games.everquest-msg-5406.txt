Killing orcs doesn't affect your faction with Highhold/pass guards, or, I
beleive, any other HH faction.  Only turning in the ears/scalps affects it.
To gain with HH Guards, kill Karana Bandits.  That gives you HH guard,
Qeynos Guard, Circle of Unseen (Qeynos Rogues), and Karana Citizen faction,
and only hurts you with the Bandits, who probably hate you anyway. =)
