There were plenty of young Vah Shir when I started there, 
although the kitty craze may have waned by now.

Everfrost seems to be pretty busy whenever I go through there.
Dark Elves and Iksar are popular especially among RPers.

Greater Faydark is the /auction zone on FV; probably less RPing
going on there than anyplace else, but it's certainly populated.

If you want to play a dwarf, I'd say play a dwarf. Other people
will show up over time.
