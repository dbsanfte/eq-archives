I have moved on! It was simply that I was curious. My Paladin is lvl 27
and I cannot remember any skill ups from lt blues. I finally had to ask.
ALL my other chars now in their late teens continue to get skill ups
from lt blues. Hardly a coincidence, but also not anything to worry
about. As I said simple curiosity!
