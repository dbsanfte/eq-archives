don't worry, I'm sure they understood that post at least.

From what I know of hackers, most hack sites etc. for the shear hell of it,
to prove it can be done etc.

Why would they want to hack an EQ character? And since most of them don't
play games anyway, what would they do with the character account if they
did? I would be more worried about them hacking your credit card details off
Verants database than your XX level barbarian whatever.
