Its worth pointing out that he said he has yet to meet a pickup group 
willing to put up with ha tank that needs to healers. 

In other words: HE is such a tank, and HE needs two healers, and HE *is* 
willing to do what it takes. But OTHERS are not.

You had a raid guild with healers willing to step up to the task. 

Pickup groups are less accomodating. 

What would your guild had done if your guild healers had *refused* to 
tandem heal in Ikkinz? Lol...I know, I know, its a rhetorical question 
that would never happen its so absurd. :)

Its par for the course in the pickup 1-group world though.

/shrug I know bazaar mules with as much /played time as you. And 
tradeskill freaks with as much /played time as you. (Ok... I admit I 
have no idea what your /played is, but it doesn't really matter... you 
get the drift.)

I know people who spend 2 hours each day stuck in downtime hell, 
willing, ready and able to fight, but LFG, or trying to replace the 
cleric that just logged on you, or explaining to some twit where that 
PoD is in PoK so he can get to you...

You on the other hand log in, step up to the raid formation, raid a few 
hours, and then wind down to 3-boxing a DoN or perhaps joining a 
splinter group from the raid doing whatever. Or perhaps just log out.

Few non-raid guilds are that efficient. It can be like pulling teeth to 
get guild groups together in most "family" guilds I've been through 
(even if they are willing, you have to lead them by the nose), and a 
root cannal to put a pick up group together outside of the DoN/LDoN 
grinding trough du jour. 

Time /played means -nothing- :)
