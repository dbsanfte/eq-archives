Aye, but I don't trust the persistency of the password hehe, nor the
'first person in' protocols.

We just changed the name of the channel, because people who'd previously
been in the chat, but are no longer welcome, we still able to get in. I
think it was to do with the ability to log into a passworded channel
without a password if you are/were a moderator. Since first person into
channel = owner with full privileges, and transferral powers.
