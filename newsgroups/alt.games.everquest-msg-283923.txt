	A cool thing happened to me today.  Was in a raid that took 
casualties when some people ran the wrong way, and I was able to 
watch the rogue in my group run back and grab the blue X's of my groupmates.
The corpse X's disappeared when he started to drag them but I could still
watch the rogue's X moving around.

	This will be a blessing for stuff like DoDH missions: "Where'd
you die?" "Dunno, slipped off a bridge somewhere..."
