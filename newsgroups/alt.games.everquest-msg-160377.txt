I used to run EQ just fine on a Celeron 300a ( OC'd to 450 ) and an ATI 
Rage Fury 32-meg.  I did have at least 384meg of RAM in there, though.  I'd 
grab her some memory - if you want her to get intested, you don't want to 
make the game tedious.  I would think adding some memory ( 256 min ) would 
help out some, and it's cheap.

Once she is hooked, she'll want the other expansions, which will require 
her to buy a new computer, though!  She'll hate that she sees you on all 
these neat zones that she can't get to and she'll want to see the cool 
models.
