My spelling is a hopeless jumble of UK and American styles, I'm afraid... 
Since I didn't learn English until my twenties, and I've lived in the US 
and the UK pretty much in equal measure since, my brain hasn't really 
standardized (heh) in a way to spell those difficult words.

When I said spelling, I wasn't picking on yours, I was referring to the 
use of abbreviations. Sorry about being misleading.
