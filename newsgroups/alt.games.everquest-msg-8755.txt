I did that in Butcherblock this weekend, pulled a white knight at the
chessboard, I was there, awake, Thats the last time I make that mistake,
Almost took him too. I think If I'd had the sense to have root up, I'd
have beaten him.  Treeform up, I knew where I had died, I forgot that
I'd been a tree, walked around my corpse for 5 minutes before hitting my
corpse hotkey.  DOH!  So I looted all but some vegatables, and dragged
my tree around for a while.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
