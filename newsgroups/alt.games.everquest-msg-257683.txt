People in my groups get symbol, ac, bss and heroic bond (or pot9/potg if 
theres a druid) when they say they need a temp / virtue. If they insist 
they get the boot. Going into an LDoN without temp isn't crippling 
yourself, adding 30 minutes messing around to the start of every ldon 
for a marginal benefit is crippling yourself.
