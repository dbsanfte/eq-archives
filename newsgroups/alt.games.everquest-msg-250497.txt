Don't buy bone chips at lower levels, get them from the skellys in
Everfrost Peaks newbie area. There are tons of them there.
With hunting mammoths starting at 20 I started seeing plat very
quickly. First thing to buy is 2 Opal Encrusted Steins. They have +25
Cha each and will get you much better prices for what you sell/buy
from/to vendors. Equip them befor you buy or sell.

I've solo leveled several necros (naked into the 20s) of different
races up into the 30s on several servers and never had to tank after
12th level. I have a 52nd level gnome necro as the highest one so not
sure of the end game side of them.

I start soloing mammoths at 20. I may die a couple of times If I get
an add but not often and by 24 mammoths are a breeze.
