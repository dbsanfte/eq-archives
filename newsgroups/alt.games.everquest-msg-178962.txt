No, that means it's a 10/25 (sorry, more comfortable listing dmg then
dly for me) that adds 3 to the damage inflicted each hit. If it
normally would have hit for 5, it hits for 8 that swing instead. Also,
damage bonus is a stat on the CHARACTER, not the weapon. It's
different for one and two handed weapons...

Live Frogloks and dead are on different factions. Opposing, in fact.
Yes, killing too many live froggies can make travelling through uppger
Guk a pain... They're not "non-aggro", they're just not KOS to you
yet...

Kunark frogloks, I beleive, are on their own faction totally
independant of their Guk cousins.
