of course, rogues get one of the two only class BONUSES, and the bigger of
the two, at that.  but no, you dont do it in less time.  i make exp
considerably quicker soloing than ever as any class in any group! but
grouping in considerably safer and more enjoyable than soloing.  believe me,
i prefer to group, but when experience isa factor- and admit it, we all
occassionally play for expereience- soloing is great! and should be a viable
part of this game, for any class you choose.  how could you not agree with
that?
