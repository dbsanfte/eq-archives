    What does Sentinal do?

    Yesterday I left my mule in the bazaar yesterday in trader mode and a
couple of friends notice that if they did a search for 1hb or 1hs weapons I
would not show. But I if they specifically typed in a item that I had I
would show up on the trader list. The could select me and buy things off of
me also.

    I noticed that I when I got home I had some summon staff on my mouse.
