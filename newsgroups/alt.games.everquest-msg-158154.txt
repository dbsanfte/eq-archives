    Aye, but why make /raid NOT work for those who don't have PoP? This is
something they've promised for a long time, and now they link it to an
expansion to boost sales? Very cheesy. I also have to wonder if this'll mess
with me and my setup. I have PoP, but I use the old UI (specifically the
small-screen one). Last night was a riot, with me unable to /rsay or do any
raid-specific commands (and I got flagged the raid leader after one LD!),
but I could still obtain flags from the looks of things. I'd hate to think I
have to camp to the new UI and make myself physically ill from the vertigo
of the big screen just to advance in PoP.

    I wonder if the mage using the AA had to go LD or not for someone to get
XP off them. Considering that you can have a pet up when you use it, I'm
guessing not.
