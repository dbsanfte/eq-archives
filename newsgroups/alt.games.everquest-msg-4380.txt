I think you are overestimating the appeal of a Star Wars MMORPG.  It
might draw a lot of people initially, but I think most will soon realize
that the Star Wars universe is one that they want to watch movies about,
and perhaps read stories about, but they don't want to play in.

It will be very interesting to see what the new games do to EQ.  Check
the server population for various level ranges (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, ...,
51-60).  Most times I check on my server (The Nameless), the biggest are
1-10 and 51-60.  A "/who all 60" usually produces too many people to
fully list.

The high end game is getting crowded.  Mobs that used to live for weeks
before someone would finally kill them (Trakanon, for example) are now
the subject of hostility and complaints between guilds, because several
guilds are ready to quickly mobilize and kill them when they are up.  My
guess is that a lot of these high level people will be eager to try a
new game.
