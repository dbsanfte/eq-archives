There are two things you might be concerned about.

1. People outside getting in.

2. Programs inside getting out.

The best way to deal with #1 is to get one of the stand-alone boxes
from Netgear, Linksys, D-Link, SMC, or others that sits between your
DSL modem and your computers.  These will prevent outside access to
your computers, while providing NAT service and DHCP to the computers
on your LAN, so you can hook more than one computer up to your DSL
connection.  You can get one of these boxes with an integrated 4 port
switch for about $100.

If you are concerned about #2, look at the software firewalls that run
on your computer that others have suggested.

Whether you need to be concerned about #2 or not depends on how you
use your computers.
