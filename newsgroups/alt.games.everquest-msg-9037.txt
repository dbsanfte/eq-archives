Hello all. I am a level 48 Barbarian Tank and I am ready to begin doing my
Epic Quest. So far I have been unable to locate a source of information on
what I need to do to begin this. Please tell me of any web sites that you
know of that can help in this. Also if I need to know the name of my Epic
weapon does anyone know the name of a warriors epic weapon? Thank you and
safe travels.
