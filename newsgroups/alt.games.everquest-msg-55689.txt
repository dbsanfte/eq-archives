You will not evade me, "Rune Maagensen" <rune@hotpop.com.SPAM>:


>Yeah right! Some of the most prude girls I've ever met was from Hawaii.

Some of the girls with most taste when confronted with a drunk Danish
slob, you mean?

You see, these habits are part of the reason why you will never score
with the Hawaiian girls - and also the reason local girls presumably
sleep with you after going to the same binges as you.

>No girls saying "no sex untill marriage" (at least not in northern Europe)

You don't live in Northern Europe, so what would you know about how
things are here? (Damn Southerners... occupy a country for 400 years
and 'steal' Greenland and Iceland, and suddenly they think they live
in the Arctic)

>Rune@flame.on

See? You asked for it.

By the way, I wouldn't have sex with you either.
