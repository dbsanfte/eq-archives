It's all true.

It's all irrelevant to the issue.

They DO post the information in an EASY to read place on the FRONT page of
the Forums *usually*.  It's very useful, it's very easy to check.

It's usually updated during the patch with relevant information.

Not checking it, and then moaning about not knowing what is going on is
futile.
