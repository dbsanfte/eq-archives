It's not a great starting location though it's perfectly ok.  Wood elves and
high elves can also wear small, a BETTER (relatively speaking) starting
location and faction just as good.  Dwarves can't be druids, necros, or
enchanters; all fairly popular classes.

Most people who start on Faydwer hunt in GFay then Crushbone.  If they
don't, they go where all the rest of their friends are; EC, NRo, Oasis and
WC.

I'm not promoting such actions, I think that the lemming view is generally a
bad one, but if you want to get a pickup group you have to go where people
feel they MUST go.  If you are level 12 you go to Oasis.  That's it.  It's
like there's NO OTHER ZONE where you can reach level 13 (or so way too many
people think).  It's a freaking shame, there's so many cooler zones in the
game, but what can you do?
