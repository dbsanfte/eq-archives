Hi all, just picked up the Velious expansion - and can't find the Kunark
anywhere except the online store (allow 4 to 6 weeks heh) - so am kind of
stuck with Velious until some supposed 'trilogy' set comes out in a few days
(really want to see Kunark).  Anyway had a few questions for any of those
bold enough to lend a hand, here goes:

1.  Level 30 druid - I know I'm seriously outclassed in Velious but a higher
level druid friend ran me around a bit on Sunday (Saw that huge ugly tower
and am bound in Thurgadin currently).  Biggest rush was when he attacked an
elder shardwurm or whatever and miscalculated his mana - net effect was me
running around basically flapping my arms and distracting this HUGE monster
while my buddy tried to get any little smidgen of mana.  At level 30 is it
just nuts to be here or is there something I can do?  hunt?  Anything away
from the hustle and bustle of the mainland oldworld?  He did show me some
Tizmaks I think out of Thurgadin and to the right some ways that con'd blue
to me mostly and I was able to solo one under my buddy's watchful eye...

2.  Snow cougars on Iceclad are just a bit much for me to solo yet, even at
full mana it becomes a waste of time in the fear/med grind - and the adds
are really painful I found out.  Anything else that I could hunt between
Iceclad and Thurgadin for a bit? ( keepin in mind I solo a fair amount, and
almost out of level 30 and do quite well in groups and don't mind grouping
if I need a leg up before I can solo some of this stuff.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions/advice/flames!
