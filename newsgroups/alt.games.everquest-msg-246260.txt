This is pure speculation, but LDoN chests are implemented as mobs. The /open
command will kill a chest (if it's unlocked), generating a corpse you can
loot. Now, obviously you can't target Uber_Mob01, type /open and kill it, not
with the normal EQ client, because it's not a chest. However, if the check
whether the target is an unlocked chest is in the client, and not the server,
you could hack the client to send the /open command to any mob in the game,
with the server happily accepting that the client knows what it's talking
about and killing the mob as if it were a chest, giving you experience and
a corpse to loot just as you get if you /open a chest.
