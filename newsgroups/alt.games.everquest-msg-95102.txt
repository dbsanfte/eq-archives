Wizards can't port TOO Luclin either, and the only Luclin port they
get is to Nexus.  Nice, but not all THAT great.  And anyway, porting
is a Wizard thing.

>SoW -> Jboots and Improved Run Speed

Neither of which is as fast as SoW.  If you wanna complain, SoW
potions might be a better point to nitpick.  Or even horses.

Anything, to my knowledge, that can see through Superior Camo can see
through regular casters Inviso spell.  I really don't see your point
here.

>Wolf Form -> KoS almost everywhere, only possible outside

It also gives faster than SoW run speed, increased attack, and
infravision.  And it can still get you into Ogguk at least in the old
world.

>DS and DoT -> Still very nice for soloing and small groups. Pretty useless
>in raids

DS is not useless on raids.  Not necessary, but far from useless. 

And DoT's in general are fairly useless on most of the raids I've been
on.  Most mobs don't last long enough to make the DoT worth casting,
or the DoT generate too much aggro causing the big, nasty mobs to
touch me in a bad way.

>Shamans Dots are better, 

Yes, and they all pretty much stack with druid DoT's.  Aside from
which, Shaman can't nuke as well as druid, nor can they TP.

>I undersatnd that Bear form is accepted most places
>Wolf form is not.

Not a big deal.  Wolfie gives more positives (Faster than SoW,
infravision, ATK bonus) than Bear form.  And Wolfie can still get
evils into most good cities and lighties into some evil cities in the
old world.

>They have regen as well, and their ability to buff,
>non-stackable with Druids, makes druid buffs pale.

Buffing is what Shaman DO.  It's the whole point of the class.  They
SHOULD be able to buff better than we do.  And hell, out Skin Like
series still stacks with Shammy buffs, just not the Cleric Valor
spells.

That said, druids also have the best Fire and Cold resist buffs.

Druids are useful in groups.  VERY useful.  Snare (invaluable), good
roots, good nukes, good DoT's, decent healing ability, excellent DS.
No, we're not the best at anything, but we can a little of almost
EVERYTHING.  The disadvantage there is that in the end game, druids
are not a NECESSARY class on high end raids.  That is far from saying
druids aren't useful.  Hell, you're doing as much to perpetuate the
rumor that druids aren't useful in groups as the bashers are.

>I try to let the bashing roll off me, but sometimes it starts to wear
>on me.

Personally, I say fuck 'em.  Druids are a handy, fun class to play.
In my experience, most of the bashers are people who are either
jealous of druids flexibility, or people that have had one or two run
in's with the l33t crowd that seems to be attracted to playing druids.
The first group, there isn't anything you can do about.  Let 'em
bitch.  The second group, all you can do is play your class the best
you can and hope they can over come their prejudice towards the class.

But push comes to shove, fuck 'em.  They can't make you feel anything
that you don't let them.
