Hehe, we got a guy like that on Veeshan too, he got 8 level 60+ chars, 
his warrior were one of the first to reach 65 because he sat in CT 
sewers for days at a time just PLing him with the rest of the chars.
That hes a moron that my guild, and the 4 guilds he got kicked out off 
found out, are a different matter, but hes able to 8-box his way to a 
LOT of nice loot.
