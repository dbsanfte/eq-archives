You are not alone. I have very few on. My husband has most on. I don't
recognize folks when I look at his screen.

I've gotten to the point where I don't care anymore that folks are
looking at a skinny halfling with shoes guy instead of my proper dwarven
good looks. Now that the novelty of glimpsin horses has worn off, I may
just shut off all new models again.
