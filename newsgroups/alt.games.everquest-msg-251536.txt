Cost should be a limiting agent, not a motivating one.

We should not be motivated by cost to change the law.

Protecting intellectual property is costly too... should we make it 
legal to steal ip and the whole problem goes away? I hope not.

As a sidebar -- re my comments about IP: While I am in favour of 
protected IP, and I don't think p2p ripping off the artists is right... 
I don't think the RIAA forcing overpriced overpackaged CDs with 19 with 
DRM, expiry dates, and duplication restrictions down our throats (while 
ripping off the artists) is any better.
