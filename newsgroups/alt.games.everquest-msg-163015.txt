Never said each time, no. But if you'd read it even once, you'd have
seen that.

Actually, from what I understand, Ebay does a pretty good job of
shutting down auctions for EQ equipment/accounts when they're reported
now days.

But the fact that people do it doesn't make it okay. People rob banks
even though it's illegal, after all... Wanna go smaller, people eat
grapes while walking through a grocery store even though they haven't
payed with them. They're still stealing, even though the store usually
doesn't bother with it because it's so small. (Usually. At random,
people will get confronted over it...)
