Loooooooong ago I hunted there for several levels and loved it.

The bat with the pet is a necro. Watch out. He's rather nasty for people
of appropriate level to hunt wisps.

Don't kill the beetles. The cat people worship them. You will lose
faction and quickly become KOS to the cat people who will take your
lunch money and make you cry.

Beware the insane Erudite who occasionally spawns up by the volcano. Way
too high level for that island.

The spiders have a downright nasty poison for your level, and are social
to an insane degree. They seem to come from halfway across the island if
you're fighting one. And they drop less silk, per capita, than any
spiders in the game. Ignore them.

The wisps spawn by two of the overturned idol rocks and path in a funky
manner down the beaches and up over the volcano rim. If you get the
island to yourself some time and follow them, you can learn the pathing
and cut down your chances of adds. It's worth the time.

Beware the shark who flies through the air. See lunch money and tears
comment above.
