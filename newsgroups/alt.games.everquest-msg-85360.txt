Depends on where you are, I guess. I play on SZ, and there the Bazaar
is a raging success, mainly because there's a bank, and (most
importantly) there's no PVP. That's where nearly all the cross team
trading goes down. You don't have to worry that you're going to sell
someone something, and then he's going to beat the snot out of you to
get his money back after the deal is done.
