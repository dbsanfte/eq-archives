That's still quite a different situation from being able to grab
anyone in the zone, anywhere, at any time.

At least with your scenario group members have to be pre-positioned
in both places (i.e. the Magician has to be in the "port to" spot,
and the group leader has to be in the "port from" spot).  The group
would have to have the foresight to bind the group leader at the
zone, be able to spare him long enough for him to gate out, etc.

Contrast that with, "I'm in the Efreeti room, I'd like to join
the dragon raid too", "I'm in the Pool room, come get me please",
"I just zoned over from Sol A, CoH me", etc.

Or conversely, the pre-patch "unlimited" CoH would have been
able to "rescue" anyone at all from anywhere in the zone, no
matter how deep.  /tell a_random_magician, "We got ourselves
in over our heads here, could you yank our butts out?"
It would also trivialize some of the "one-way" dungeon
passages/traps, if any Magician in the zone could just pluck
the foolhardy explorers back to safety.  For example, if someone
fell down into the bear pits in Permafrost, all they'd have
to do is recruit a Magician to port them to safety.  But with
the "fixed" CoH (more accurately, tweaked /assist command),
someone would have to actually go down into the bear pits WITH
the clumsy oaf in order to rescue him, a far trickier operation.

Finally, imagine using the pre-patch CoH in a huge zone
like Eastern Wastes, to either assemble a group out of
people situated all over the zone, or using a Magician
in the following manner in the Dreadlands:  "/ooc Will
port you instantly to the KC entrance from anywhere in
the zone, 10p, send tells".

All of this becomes moot if the Magician's group leader
needs to schlep himself over to where the person(s)
who want CoH happen to be -- that's a far different
thing than a lone Magician being able to just reach out
and grab anyone in the zone without a group "link" at
the "customer's" location.
