Well, the easy way to level is do LDoN adventures.  I average one
level per 3 adventures.  So, it's not very difficult to gain 1 level
per 4 hours or so.  I leveled my druid from 35 to 47 in about 10 days.
Also, being an enchanter, you'll have no diffculty finding a group.
If you pay someone you're going to miss out on learning how to
effectively play the character at the higher levels and not meet new
friends.  This will have a very negative effect in the long run,
especially if this character is your main.
