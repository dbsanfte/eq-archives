1) It will ship on the 8th , it goes live on the 9th, due to delivery 
methods/holdups/distance from shipper some stores may not recieve it untill 
the 9th to the 12th. Amazon will probably recieve it on the afternoon of the 
8th and will begin shipping it out to pre-order customers then.
2) cd and dvd versions are identical packs no seperate bonuses, lots of 
people ran out of the bonus disk, so they may have designated a certain 
number to the cd / dvd sales independantly and ran out of the dvd allotment.
3) they should be the same offer, i can't imagine amazon making their own. 
Havent got my preorder disk yet, i ordered through ebgames and they sent the 
preorder through usps so hopefully it will get here before eq2 goes live. i 
took the free shipping method for the game itself so it won't recieve it 
till the 12th. (that should let a couple crashes an patches go by :O)  )
