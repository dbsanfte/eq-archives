I haven't been playing all that long comparatively,
but seems like there have been more instances of
rude behavior lately than even just a month or two
ago. The casting of an MGB that overwrites one that
was much better that had been cast just a second or
two previously, numerous bards hanging out in the
bank for inordinate amounts of time singing away,
making the lag MUCH worse, etc.
