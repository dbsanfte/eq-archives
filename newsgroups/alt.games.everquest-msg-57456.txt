Sorry for the misspelled word. My mother forgot to speak english to me from
the day I was born. Later on some crazy teachers tryed to make me speak and
write something like english but it was very hard and I hope they didn't
ended to a psychiatric institution after that LOL.

Btw I managed to learn that damn language by myself and reading usenet news
helped somehow. Still can't stand what they are realy talki'n about at CNN.
Duh ! Is that cyborg english on TV ?

Now yes I live (right spelling ?) in France, hate cheese, don't dring whine,
don't eat french bread and... Oh yes I know it's realy silly for a french
girl.

BTW I'm still fed up with the pour availability of Antonius Bayle.

/thank
