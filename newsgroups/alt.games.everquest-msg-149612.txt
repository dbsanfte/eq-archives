Eh, YMMV, I guess. Chaincasting True North or Dance of the Firefiles while
fishing, or waiting for the spires or a ship doesn't seem like that big a
deal to me...

As long as you intend to be at the keyboard while practicing, it's not
that big a deal. I twist Denon's while running through the Karanas, Qeynos
Hills, Commons, Everfrost. The port pads in Nexus are big enough to stand
on that you won't get the Scions with Denon's while you wait.

The Arena is the best zone for practicing Brass, especially when you get
your first Brass song at 18. The only NPC in the zone is the Soulbinder.
No mobs. Almost never any players. Just turn it on and go AFK for a while.
Now if only it had a pond so you could practice Swimming at the same time...
