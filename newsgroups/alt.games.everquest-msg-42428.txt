One of the weapons used in vietnam, was to take advantage of americans
general love for children, and child like innocence, where a child would
have a bomb in a backpack or strapped to them, and go running up to
american soldiers, who did not expect children to be used as a bomb. 
That is one of the reasons why american soldiers wound up so fucked in
the head after the war, and why some of them before the war was over
would shoot children on sight.
