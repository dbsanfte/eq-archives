Because Israel doesn't do terrorism.  They conduct legitimate military
operations against an armed and brutal enemy.  In such operations,
innocents have been killed.  It's sad, of that there is no doubt..

THAT is your definition of terrorism!?!??  No wonder your opinion is
so half-assed and skewed....


>i've spoken against the killing of innocent people in any way.. that's words
>spoken for "reason, life".

No you haven't..  All you have done is try to justify the
unjustifiable...

I have yet to hear you address the issue of 9/11 I raised..

Surely, you feel that was a justified act, no??
