I'm doing the bard newbie armor quest. I need a couple of orc bones in CB
but I can't really solo the slave pit yet. I've only grouped once where it
really worked out. I can wait til I find some better players to go with. The
only other thing I need is the basilisk hatchling hide. Ugh. I've hated
basilisks ever since my old D+D days. When I first started playing EQ, I saw
the hatchlings and thought they might be easy meat. If you're ever in GFay
and see statues of wood elf bards in the forest, that would be me. All 127
of them. That creature has killed me more times than any other.

But I finally got Bellow, so I think it's worth a shot to kite one. Before,
they seemed to be all around. Now that I'm looking for one, they are nowhere
to be found. Did the game read my mind? Did it realize that I wasn't as
scared of them anymore? I'm walking around killing spiders and wolves while
I'm looking for them (need to work on my tailoring and baking skills). I
bellow at a matriarch and...yawn.., here she comes, this will be easy. Then
I gear that all too familiar sound, my head spins and I read "you are
stunned". I look down and who is there nut my old friend the basilisk. I'm
pretty much stunned, getting no damage on him and down to about 30%. Finally
I break free, hit Selo's and I'm off, screaming like a 12 year old girl. I
have no idea wher I'm going (why can't I sense direction in my own home
zone?)I miss Kelethin entirely. I don't know if the basilisk is still there,
but the spider is on my tail. I'm taking no chances. I run all the way to
ButcherBlock, wher the first thing I see are about half a dozen basilisks.
This game is spooky.
