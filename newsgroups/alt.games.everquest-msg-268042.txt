I did point out a strategy with lower numbers. But yours should work
fine too. Altough I do have a few suggestions.

Not sure what you mean here but there is nothing except spiders.

As the AE from MB won't touch anything outside his room there is no
danger of pets going berzerk.

This is something I can't make sense of. What are these groups for? Just
put your mezzers alongside the normal spidergroups. If you got more than
one mezzer per group let them be backups there. But a special mezzer
group isn't required. As Ben pointed out in another post one mezzer per
corner should be enough.

As mentioned dump these mezzers in the spider groups and don't care
about the spiders already en route to MB. Unless one spider group
manages to miss a spider nothing bad happens.

Indeed it is. :)

I doubt that healers need LoS. Unless the MT is out of range they should
be fine even behind closed doors.

Telling them to slowly fall back towards MB isn't a good option in my
book. The spiders won't spawn that fast. And the range on mezzes should
be sufficient to even catch a spider that spawned when another mezz is
underway.

Just out of the room is enough. Btw, bards can clear aggro too. ;)
