I have played all BL races to at least level 20, and took a Barb all
up to 44 before retiring him.

I don't think there is a "best" race for BLs. Regen (Trolls, Iksar) is
nice, but so is not being stunned from the front (Ogre). Vah Shir and
Barbs have the best faction, and do not suffer the experience
penalties the other races have. Each race plays a little different,
but overall I didn't feel that any of them stood out as the "best"

Exp Penalties:
Vah Shir 0%
Barbarian 5%
Orge 15%
Iksar/Troll 20%

My advice is to pick the race that you think looks best. You really
can't go wrong with any BL race.
