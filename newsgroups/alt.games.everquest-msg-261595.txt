Personally, I thought that very process added flavor to the act of 
upgrading your gear. You did it in an open market-like environment, just as 
I would expect from this genre.

I don't like the impersonal "vending machine" approach of the Bazaar. Half 
the fun of the buying/selling process should be in the prospect of being 
able to haggle and making a deal with a real person.
