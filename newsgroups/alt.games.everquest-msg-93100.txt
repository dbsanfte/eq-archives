Could be the case, I certainly don't know.  All I can say is that all the
research I did prior to buying one pointed me directly at the Netgear
solution, not the Linksys one.  I do not in any way at all regret that
decision, it has worked completely flawlessly since day one.  It is hidden
away under the stairs in the basement, turned on all the time, never had to
reset, never had to do anything.  If I were to look for a replacement, I
would buy Netgear again, no question at all.  I understand that many people
have the same experience with the Linksys router, however, many do not as
well.  I don't have any figures on sales of the different brands, only my
impressions gained from browsing various newsgroups, and contacting owners
of said routers.
