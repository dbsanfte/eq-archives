No, I'm not trying to start another useless thread about the good
versus evil of twinking.  If I wanted to start a useless thread, I'd
just post a complaint about players inspecting me! ;-)

But anyway, last night in LOIO (yes, I said I wanted to avoid that
place but I broke down and went anyway!), some player /ooc's, "Level
22 TWINK monk lfg!".  Immediately a couple of players start insulting
him, saying things like "The fact that you brag about being a twink
just makes you look worse to other people" and the inevitable
umpteenth discussion started about how "twinks merely got their good
gear from a high level character started from scratch so they're
actually good players"/"they give their good gear to a class which
they have no clue how to play and wind up getting their groups killed
so they're actually bad players", etc., etc.

Well, I then made some comment about "I just think it's weird that
somebody would actually use the fact that they're twinked as a selling
point, like we're turning down nontwinks to join our groups because
we're waiting for a twink to come along!", which got several laughs.  

Anyway, just wondering what you think about players who promote their
twinkdom in order to help them find groups.

Happy hunting,
