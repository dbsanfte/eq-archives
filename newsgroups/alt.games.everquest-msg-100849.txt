For the record (and for those who didn't read far enough back in the
thread) here's my original *question*. (Note: "question". Not "bitch")
***************
After I create a channel for my raid party (/join Jakuggsraid: password)
and have everyone else join, how do we make that the "default" chat
choice? (i.e. so everything I type normally will go out in that channel
instead of my normal default of /group or /guild, et.)  The channels are
a HUGE improvement for mixed guild raiding parties, but it's a pain to
have to type every message with a prefix of "/1 <msg>".  Particularly
when it's a fast moving raid with a ton of mobs coming in. Resetting the
hotkeys for this is easy enough, but for those general raid commands,
("DON'T push the PoZ over the WALL!!!") I'd rather not have to futz
around with it.
**********************

I was going on the assumption that I could change my default chat mode
to the new channel and was simply asking how to do it. I would be
*easier* to do that than type /1 ever time. I'll still use it if I can't
do that, and I still think it's great. But this would be a further
enhancement if they implemented a way to change it to the default for
the length of the raid.

Oh, and DT? Bite me.
