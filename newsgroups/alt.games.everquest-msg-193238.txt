I have a GEForce 440 (not exactly top of the line) that actually has
two monitor out spots on it.  Unfortunately I don't remember any more
about the card.  However, you don't even need this.  You *can* set up
two monitors on one system by just splitting the cable.  You only need
one video card.  I have set this up before and as long as you have
windows 98 or later, you essentially will have another monitor with
extended desktop space on it.

You can buy the cable splitter at a computer store.  What I don't know
is how this will function with Everquest.
