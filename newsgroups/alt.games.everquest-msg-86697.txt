Sigh, RL I am a Hardware Engineer, designing and writing firmware for
computer boards of all types and uses.

I get asked this question a lot. By Engineers, Project Managers,
Janitors and Dwarves alike. If a nice lady like Lokari asked me this
question, "Whats Better" I would not hesitate to give my learned
opinion.

Learned Opinion of "whats better":
Order the fish. The fish is better. Perhaps you may like the beef, I
don't. Order the fish, the fish is much better. Under no circumstances
should you order the Chicken. Thats why I picked this place, the fish
is very good here.
<end of opinion>

 Buy an AMD. One of the guys on my design team owns AMD stock and when
it goes up, he is a lot easier to deal with. Otherwise, there isn't a
whit of difference there.

If I encased a machine in black plastic, and asked you to run
benchmarks on them all day, you would not be able to identify the AMD
from the Intel box.
