Maybe I'm just lucky but I've found a trick that seems to help me
whenever I'm having EQ problems. Keep in mind that I'm not running SoL
so I don't have any of the nightmares attached to that. However, I've
discovered that if I'm having trouble getting to the Character Select
screen, or go LD and can't get back for an extended period of time, all
I have to do is delete a single file and it seems to clear up my
problem. The file is eq.tmp. My initial step when I'm having problems
now is to delete that file and so far I've had nothing but success
getting back into the game. Maybe it's just coincidence but since it's a
temp file I'm thinking that it could be holding some information that
wasn't removed due to whatever problems occurred. If I can help even one
person with their frustration then my work here is complete!

I don't want this anger that's burning in me.
It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
