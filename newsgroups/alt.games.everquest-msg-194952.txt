I bought a few bloodstones, went to the POK book to Halas, and logged out.

Then I made a brand new barbarian shaman and put every point into charisma and
ran him out to the same spot.

Logged back in with my shaman, dropped the gems on the ground.

Logged back in my little barb and picked it up, jogged over to the vendor, sold
the gems bought the spells, ran back and dropped the spell

Logged back in with my Iksar and picked it up, good to go.

I actually tried to hire someone to run this errand for me.. but 5pp to buy a
1pp spell wasn't getting any takers.
