Assist the mob.  If you are the target, you succeded.  If the chanter
(or anyone else) is the target, taunt again.

This is because you didn't know about assisting the mob, you thought
it was a crap shoot.

mem blur is a waste of mana, time, and a spell slot for most mobs,
a successful taunt places the warrior at top of hate list plus one,
so if the chanter isn't going to be casting anything more on the mob,
he's safe as houses with a successful taunt, which costs no mana
or slot.  Mem blur, like atone, works to save the cleric from getting
pounded on, since the warrior is only one point over him, and
subsequent heals can get him back up on top.  Its still usually a waste
of time.

Not responding to the situation.

If he's not pulling, sure.  Its situational.
