The first time I saw an Iksar I tried to attack him.  I thought it was a new
mob in BlackBurrow...  He thought it was pretty funny.  Then this guy fell down
seemingly DEAD one day for no apparent reason - I wasted a ton of mana trying
to *save* a feigning dead monk.  
My ranger grew up very poor and didn't leave Surefall/Qeynos until she was 13
or so, (except for one naked cross continental trip which was a blast.  But
even then it was through Butcherblock into Greater Fay.. I don't think I ever
*saw* a troll until I went to Lake of Ill Omen).
My first port was around level 25 I'd guess - and it was from Fironie Vie. 
(The thought of getting back on that boat was more than my mind could deal with
:).  Who had 10 spare plat back in those days to spend on TRAVELLING?  And I
*never* would have disrespected myself or my class by asking strangers for
buffs, (much less MONEY or ARMOR)....
Things were different when *I* was a child...:)
