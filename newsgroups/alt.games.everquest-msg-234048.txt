I think one of the main reasons is that it's sooo easy to level to 50+
now. Also, a lot of people are twinks who didn't need to learn a whole
lot on the way to 50th lvl because their gear would carry them that
far. Once you get to 50, it becomes a lot more expensive to twink and
most people actually have to start dealing with the fact that their
gear won't carry them any further. 

It does seem to get better at 65 though. at least on Bristlebane I
haven't run across anyone in LDoN at that level that I wouldn't group
with again while my lower lvl characters have run across plenty.
Playing style and group makeup also makes a huge difference. Even at
65, I've seen a cleric freak out and zone on a 4 pull with no mezzer.
I guess if you're used to pickup groups, that kind of thing can be
kinda intimidating but since that group was made up mainly of friends
that knew each other's playing style, it was a pretty trivial fight
for the 5 that didn't run away.
