Yeah, dex doesn't really come into play unti 61(?) when you get the
fists. But a dual wielding, hasted, focused air pet with Ferine Avatar
is something to behold. I remember running a parse on my pet DPS at
around 50th lvl with str and it was over a 5% increase, since str
buffs are cheap is usually worth keeping up imo.

Yeah, if the shaman is pulling, you're usually better off just pulling
with Mal-x. It's something I'd always cast (over around 40th lvl) if I
was soloing or doing with a caster (other than an enchanter). And
really, shaman is pretty much always gonna be the top choice for
puller in your duo since she can get an overpull undercontrol before
she ever gets back to camp. I'd also recommend getting her the booties
if you haven't already, you two can duo everything up to Dire, and
your cleric can always solo him for her.

Yeah, probably more a matter of teaching 'em not to use that damn
earth pet! :p
