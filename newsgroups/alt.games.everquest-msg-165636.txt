Being that your friend is a younger player I can only guess some of this may
be his own doing.  For starters item pricing is subjective, maybe the
guildie bought it for 3k way back when?  The bazaar has changed the pricing
of some items considerable, and the new expansions have had their impact too
(lammy went from 6k to 1.5k).

There is also the issue of what *exactly* your friend said, versus what he
thought he said.  Especially as a new player, it's easy to get some concepts
confused (the afflication haste vs. haste item).

There are folks who prey on the innocent and that sucks, but it's a gross
generalization to assume you can't trust anyone in EQ due to one bad
experience.  Who hasn't been burned once or twice?

My advice is to ask LOTS of questions and get the facts, not opinions before
making big decisions.  Don't make emotional decisions in a game of numbers.
