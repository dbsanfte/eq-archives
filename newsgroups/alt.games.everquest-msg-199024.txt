This is partly due to the lack of 60+ chanters on KB. However, over
the past month there have been alot of new KEI casters in PoK. I don't
expect the price to stay at 100pp for much longer.

There was one instance where a chanter named Laksmi was casting for
about 40pp, but the other chanters got on her case about it and we
haven't seen her since =(

While we're on the subject, there is rumor going around that in an
upcoming patch KEI won't stick to anybody under level 46, regardless
of who the enchanter targets in the group. Can somebody confirm this?
