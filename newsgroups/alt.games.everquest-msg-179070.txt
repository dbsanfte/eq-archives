That's true.  If you are in a guild with a lot of people your level, or you
have a group of friends that play at the same time these levels can be some
of the best ever.  There are a LOT of dungeons at these levels that are a
blast.  Dungeon crawling is a lot more fun (and more dangerous) than just
hanging around in an outdoor zone pulling and killing over and over again.

It can be hard to find people at these levels that want to explore though.
A lot of people are playing alts and all they want to do is get them high
enough to join the guild their main character is in.  Sometimes they are
even being levelled by the guild to fill in a class that the guild is low
on, so these players don't really want to "play" these levels as much as
they just want to get through them.  New players like yourself on the other
hand can be very wary of going into dungeon zones when they don't know their
way around, or how to fight in a dungeon setting.

Oh BTW I play on Drinal too, so post your characters name and I'll look you
up.  I have a 29 Necro and my son plays a 31 level SK and I've been planning
on introducing him to a couple of dungeons, but we need a couple more to
fill out a group.
