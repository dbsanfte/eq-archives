> > Anybody else have stupid stories they've seen or done?

This just happened today .. I don't spend too much time in Velious, so the
corpse dragging rules aren't engrained into my head yet .. Me and a few
guildies were killing the two Coldain in Icewell that drop the pieces for
the Coldain Skin Gloves and Boots quests .. Our necro (Darkray) died when
she sent in her pet too early when we took on Grand Huntsman Darral. We
ended up having to evac because Mytra and myself were running out of mana
and wouldn't be able to keep heals going and still have enough to nuke when
Darral ran at the end .. Anyway ..
