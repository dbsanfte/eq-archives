1000 pp / hour would be pretty impressive if it was guaranteed.  I for one
wouldn't buy into one of these systems, there are enough ways in game to
make cash... after you play it for awhile, you'll pick up on some yourself.
At level 3, you won't have money coming in hand over fist for quite
sometime.

I didn't start making decent money until I hunted mobs that dropped fine
steel weapons.  I found a decent spot for money was in Cazic Thule, but you
shouldn't go there until you are around lvl 20 or so.  Mobs drop FS weapons,
and there are a varity of rare drops that you can auction off and sell for a
couple of hundred pp each.  As a druid, once you're able to gate people
around you can make side cash as a taxi service.  At level 3 though, just
kill things and try to have fun.
