Was gonna say something along that lines. To many different situations to
name the spells i have memmed. for the most part I have

1 Tash
2 Mem
3 root
4 stun
5 stun
6 boon
7 Haste
8 Clarity (Buff slot mainly)

4 and 5 get swapped out alot for me. Can put stuns in there, fear, charm,
etc. In my opinion tho I'd have to seriously agree with Kev. Enchanters HAVE
to be super flexable and especially as level advances and your role evolves
(And can change totally from group to group, solo, partnered etc). to much
to put on one email. heh
