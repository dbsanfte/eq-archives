I group whenever the oppurtunity presents itself, but there are just somedays
when you're on your own. 

*shrugs*

I've had my share of good groups, had more than any person's share of poorly
run groups, and have yet to have a raid go smoothly(mostly because my guild
raids with an ally guild that doesn't really seem to have any hierarchy in
place to keep the members in check & paying attention...we once had a guy
running around like an idiot in KD, dropping from a stalagmite near the
entrance and taking damage, and constantly moaning about how much time all the
healing between battles was taking up...yeah, danke for helping speed up the
process...but i digress..), i enjoy a group when i can get one, but i also
enjoy being alone with my thoughts sometimes...

And it's kinda handy not being attached to a group when a guildmate needs help.

But anywho, take the little guide as a suggestion for stuff to kill and places
to visit when you can't get into a group. 
Grouping can sometimes be slightly hard for a sub-30  ranger, after which
everyone(who can't find a druid or a shaman) wants to be your friend for free
SOW...
