Because bergh is always going to be there, right?
Because bergh is the cleric who didn't die, right?
Because bergh wants 50 tells from 1-5 people, right?

I don't think so.

Oh ok.  I should forget dragging corpses asap, I should do a "who guild
cleric", find out which are at the raid (and not just at the zoneline), then
devise a way of splitting the rez tells between each cleric.  Then drag the
corpse to them.

Who cares? Rez is free, rez is manaless, why look for a specific named
corpse whilst other corpses are piling around your feet?  Just point and
click.

You see a corpse, you hail it. Then you rez.
You click another corpse.  You hail it. Then you rez.
If you recall seeing that corpse hailed, leave it.  If you missed the hail,
so what?  Rez is free.  Its faster to just click the corpse again than
scroll through channels of spam for each individual name.

What exactly is slower about seeing a corpse and clicking, then clicking on
the next corpse, versus waiting for named corpses to be pulled to your feet,
searching for the corpse, looking in the channel to see if they were rezzed?
