The title says it all, for all those who knew me as Iksalama, Xangor,
Xantar, Erudama, Iksalaama, Dorfama, Luqy Sharmz that I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to in game I hope I get a chance to do so here (BTW, Xegony
server is where I called home)

I just realized that I didn't have time to play as much as I needed to to
stay up to date.  This has been a great life (In EQ) from way back in Beta
to present day but I must go on to other ventures.  Thank you to all that
helped me out along the way and a special thanks to those that made my
friends list (you know who you all are) and my guildies in Infinite Jest and
also in Judgment, the game just wouldn't have been the same without you all.
Good luck to all that continue to play.

Chuck

PS.  In case anyone is wondering I gave away all my gear to a lucky level 5
shaman and level 4 warrior (10k worth of stuff to each of them and about 20k
in coin) so don't bother asking if you can have my stuff.
