hmmm...toughie...Here's the way we usually handle it.

If someone goes LD during a battle, we usually give about 15-20 minutes to
at least hear from them.  If they come back in a relatively short amount of
time, we get status update (bind point, eta, ect), and if necessary, assist
them in their return.  If they have not logged back in after 30 minutes, we
will typically find a replacement until they return, with the replacement
being fully aware that he is filling in until Guildie returns.
