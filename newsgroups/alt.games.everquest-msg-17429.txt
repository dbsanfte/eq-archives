I was reading in Everlore about the "Edge of Cabills" 2h Sword.

 I have a Dark Reaver 20/42, and a Cabills 25/50 and I've been trying to
sell the Cabills for about a month. I have been asking 200pp.
 Now, after reading some post from some fellow SKs, I found most prefer the
Edge Of Cabills, over the Dark Reaver. Not to mention that many say that the
"Edge of Cabills" sells for 750-850pp on most servers.

 I guess my question is,
 Is the Cabills a better choice ?
should I find out how each works in a certain situation or am I wasting my
time ?
