Hi everyone:

Yes I know this question has probably been asked before, but I'm unable to
download and review all the prior messages on this Newsgroup. So, my
question is this. I have a 1.4 Ghz Pentium 4, 1 Gig of RDRAM and am *still*
unable to view the textures and character models in anything other than low
(texture) res with any degree or playability. I play in full screen
transparent mode at 1024*768. All my character models are off with the
exception of Gnomes. I'm currently using 32MB nVidia TNT Pro2 with Windows
XP - Basically, which graphics card should I upgrade to? I like the high res
mode (1024*768) but I'm wanting to view nice textures and at least *some*
character models during gameplay. Any help would be greatly appreciated ...
Money is a bit of a squeeze, but if I have to shell out, well, so be it ..

Kind regards and safe hunting to all ...

Stevie.
