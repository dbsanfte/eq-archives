See, people continue to argue the semantics of whether the
word is appropriate or not, completely missing the point. It
doesn't matter if thousands of you find nothing wrong with
it.  Others do, and their position is no less valid than your
own.  Blizzard was forced to make decisions on certain words,
since there are differing opinions.  So they made the call and
set down the law.  Them's the breaks folks.  It's their service.
This is like whining for a week after getting a speeding ticket
for going 3 over.  Ya, it sucks, and that would be really lame
and ridiculous.  But that's just the way it is, and you aren't going
to change it no matter how hard you try.

I just remember this nonsense from during the beta, where all
the rude kids who think anything goes would argue over and
over and on and on about what they felt was offensive or not,
completely missing the point.  It doesn't matter what YOU think.
It doesn't matter that YOU think the word is OK.  It doesn't matter
that someone else thinks the word is bad.   You aren't going to single
handedly change all public opinion on the word.   Blizzard had to
choose, and they choose, and that's the rule they choose to enforce.

Don't like it? Don't play it. Or take it up with them personally.

The damn 72 hours is already up by now anyway.  All I see is
grandstanding and nitpicking between people who are too busy
arguing about the damn word when it's irrelevant.
