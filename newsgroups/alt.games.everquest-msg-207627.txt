Ah, like the enchanter Bind Sight I used on my alt once upon a time.

I once went to Lesser Faydark, cast Lesser Illusion, and spent an hour 
exploring by jumping from critter to critter... SUCH a cool spell, I only 
wish there was a tinkered item or somethying that could give me that 
ability on my Monk...
