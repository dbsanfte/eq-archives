Except that even at the levels where us Shaman, and Druids have the same
heal spell, it does not heal as much HP as the exact same cleric spell.
Clerics get a 15% bonus on their heals.  Thus, they are always better at
pure healing.  Now you could make some arguments regarding using other
spells to avoid the damage altogether, thus requiring far less healing.
