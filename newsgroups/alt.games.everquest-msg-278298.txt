LOL I guess my account is still somewhere with my lvl 57 cleric.  I
hadn't played in like 3 years, then entered again when I found a $15
box with like all the expansions up to PoP so decided to see how things
were (which included a free month). Of course I only played like 2
days, when my old friends took me to the new awesome things... and then
they wanted to camp some ship with me killing green (to me)/gray (to
them) sailors for a spell.  After like 1 hour of doing so I remembered
why I left EQ.
Hey if you find a buyer, maybe he wants to buy my account too, a lvl 57
cleric (with oooohhh plane of hate/fear 2001-uber equipment), and
several other characters about lvl 25 or so.
Kidding really, didn't sell it then when it was worth a lot of dough,
why sell it now heh
