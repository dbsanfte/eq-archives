you are missing the point methinks. You are implying that druids have an
easier time gaining experience, gaining a group to kill with ,and gaining
that thing that we all crave phat lewts. I do not agree, in point of fact I
think that druids have a harder to much harder time gaining all 3 than other
classes do.

I would like to see this imbalance corrected and think that the principal
method of doing so is to make all 3 healing classes healers. (oh my what a
concept) healing was always considered to be a strict necessity and there
are 15 classes. One presumes that they meant to have nice even groups of 6
and that the 3 healing classes where made to make sure that every group had
access to a healer with a little extra healer to spare. Ask any tank how
much it sucks ass not to have one. This worked just fine to the beta test
point of about 30th level. This does not work at all now.

At present near 1/6th of the population is a cleric. This makes them by far
the single loudest group , and the biggest lobby. They bitch moan and
complain about their lot in life 3 times as often and as loud as any other
can. At 34th level for 400 mana they can and do heal 6000 hps of dammage ,
this represents a level of healing power so far above the other 2* healers
as to be laughable. I understand fully that clerics will draw a line in the
sand and scream bloody murder every time any one even dares to suggest we
take away there nice comfy monopoly. I am tired of knowing every time I meet
a new cleric , oh he must suck ass so much he had to make a cleric to ever
get a group. I want it fixed for everyones sake, and actually care little
that the best way to fix things is to improve the group desireability of a
druid. (you do realize that complete heal will never aid a druid in soloing
one bit?)

* I am dismissing for present the fact that paladins actually heal better
than both druids and shamans since they shouldnt . I am dismissing the fact
that necros heal pretty damn well to if you happen to have 15 buffs already
(did they fix this yet? I havent played a necro account in awhile). I am
also dismissing the fact that monks who can bind up to 100% are fairly
impressive and that bards can do a pretty good job of regeneration as well.

Oh and I am also dismissing the fact that I powerleveled 3 cleric accounts
up to 49. Takes a couple of days each time. Usually  there is a druid around
who will want to take over a cleric account once they figure out how sad
their lot in life really is.
