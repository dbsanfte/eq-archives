>terrible luck with events.
>

I feel so honored that I was graced by profanity. My story did not change.
On the first day of the events I could get on eq which is why I posted that
I had bad luck with events and not getting drops. Then Ray posts about them
being non normal GM events. Really who cares? I wasn't posting about that
anyway. I have bad luck, and I was just posting as such. Though I had
forgotten to add congrats on your luck. Then I add in that during the second
day I did have misfortune with 2 of my comps being fried. Is that a story
change? Um, last I checked thats<in addition> to the bad luck with events,
which I would consider bad luck when it happens coincidentally when the
events start. Whats funny is that you think my life is so miniscule enough
to bother to lie about things that don't matter to people I don't know. Its
bad enough that my life sucks enough that I devote most of my time to EQ
anyway. But its glad to see that finally, something to do about my original
post was referred to eventually. And are you psychic? I mean you nailed the
cheat sheet thing down. It took me months to get a cheat sheet so that I
could write this post.
