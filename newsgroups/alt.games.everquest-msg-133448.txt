The vast majority of the time, anti-collusion measures,
both in real life and in game situations, are unnecessary
because collusion is an unstable strategy.

The reason is that in collusive agreements, each
party has a strong incentive to sell out the other guy(s).

The reason that the airlines, for example, are on the
bleeding edge of bankruptcy much of the time isn't
because they're legally barred from colluding, it's
because if they did and agreed on an industry-wide
ticket price that would give them all a comfortable
margin of profit, some joker would break from the
pack, price his tickets 10% lower, and get the
majority of the ticket sales.

The OPEC cartel didn't hold together very long
for similar reasons, nor did pre-Sherman attempts
by cigarette manufacturers to simultaneously
raise the price of all cigarette brands (some
upstart always popped in to undercut them).

That might happen if Deadbob didn't really want the item
(in which case he'd probably pass anyway and Deadjane would
still get the item cheap or via default), but a more likely
scenario is:

# Deadbob /tells Deadjane "Hmm, I'd spend 25 points for that
# Deadjane /tell Deadbob "Oh I'd spend 50!"
# Deadbob /tells Deadjane "Screw you, you liar, I know
   you have something just about as good and you wouldn't
   blow 50 points on a tiny upgrade..."
# Deadjane /tells Deadbob "Well, maybe I wouldn't spend
   50, but I'd spend 30, so you might as well let me take
   it."
# Deadbob /tells Deadjane "To hell with that, I'll see
   you in the bidding war, put your points where your
   mouth is..."

...only for items that Deadbob doesn't want enough to
fight for.

Even if this would happen a lot, and I doubt it, I fail to see
why it's a big problem.  The SK's were spending their points shrewdly,
the Warrior's weren't, and thus got less for their "money".  That's life.
Let the Warriors get their act together if they want to compete
on an equal basis with the SKs.  Or not and accept the consequences.
Everyone knows the system, and everyone has an equal ability to
play it any certain way.

But if it bothers people enough, one solution is to lessen
the "need before greed" restriction.  That way any item drop
is potentially in contention from everyone on the raid, and
no class-based collusion is possible.  But people would very
likely reserve a good number of their points for items that
they really do need to improve their characters, instead of
frittering away their points on every auctionable item that
drops.
