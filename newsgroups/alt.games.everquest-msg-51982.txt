 1) What and Why do you 'camp'
   - I suppose that it have nothing to do with the 'sit & camp'
     exit procedure...
**************************************************
 Camping a site refers to when an individual or group knows the "spawn" site
of a particular "thing to be killed".  Some areas have a faster spawn rate
than others, not to mention rare spawns which can be necessary for quests.
Sometimes people camp for an item... sometimes just for simple exp.
**************************************************
2) How do I get my Wood Elf Ranger to run with / first use the bow ?
   - to me it looks at bit weird that she runs with the sword drawn..
     instead of the bow..
*************************************************
The bow, when placed in the inventory, will automatically go to the "Ranged
Item" slot.  If you also put arrows in the ammo slot you are ready to roll.
I would move the "Range Attack" hot key from your "Combat Skills" menu to
your hot keys.  The bow is great for pulling creatures or if you are able...
kiting.
Kiting:  Generally this...  Make the "to be killed" slower than you, then
move away keep enough distance so it can't hit you, but you can launch
arrows (or spells) at it relatively safely.  Just be careful not to agro
more while kiting and you can generally take on higher level kills easier.
