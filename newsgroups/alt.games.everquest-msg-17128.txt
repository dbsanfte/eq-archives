Iirc, old world mobs keep chasing you until you zone (or clear agro some
other way) or die.  Afaik, if the mob gets hung up on the zone geometry it
will warp to where you are.

As I figure it, since you were bound in L Guk when you gated, you did not
clear agro; the Hand tried to chase you, got caught up on something and
warped right next to you.

aren't enough strait-jackets to go around for the rest of the world, so
they're trying to put me in one.
