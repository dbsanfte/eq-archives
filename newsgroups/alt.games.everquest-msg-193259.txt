I bet I could get a lot of people to support a "Press here to raise a
level!" button on the character inventory screen, or a "Pat the bunny,
get a plat" NPC outside every city, but that doesn't mean they're not
stupid ideas.

Besides, I don't hate you because you're uber.  I know you're not
uber. =p

That'd be like hating me because I'm a black woman from Cleveland!
