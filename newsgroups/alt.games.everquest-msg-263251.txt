... the 4th result on google for "preorder", regards Halo2, and includes 
this sentence (which actually regards GTA:VC)...

"Whether or not this constitutes "the highest presale in the history of 
video games" is also disputed. Some reports put preorders for 2002's 
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City at more than 4 million, but Microsoft 
asserts that to its knowledge, the title "did not presell more than 1 
[million] units." The discrepancy probably arises from the two different 
definitions of "preorder." One definition involves retailers' orders, 
while the other involves customers whose money has been put down in 
advance of a game's release."

Prepaying is not uncommon, some retailers only charge when they ship, 
many require a 'deposit' to confirm your order (ie to get some skin in 
the game to prove you are serious about buying it), while others 
literally charge you up front.

I guess either way, you'd be right in not calling it an interest free 
loan to the developer, as *they* likely won't see any of that money 
until the publisher actually ships to the retailers. Which makes your 
prepaid preorder an interest free loan to the retailer... which is even 
more pointless imo.

(Although if the retailers are reporting a 1 million times $X in pre-
orders, that might getting money from the investors, banks, and 
elsewhere go a lot smoother.)
