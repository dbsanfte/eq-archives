Hmmm.... I must disagree.  I'm an adult and I have spare cash.  I would never
spend it to "buy" plat or a higher character.  The fun of the game is earning
my own way, IMO.  I may twink my newbie characters, but only with my old "hand
me downs".  
On the other hand my teenage nephews would probably part with their money to
"buy" their way into "uberdom".  Since their parents spoil them rotten they
have no concept of "paying their own way" or "earning their keep" in real life,
why would they do it in a game?
Well, ok, this entire post is based on my somewhat biased opinion .....
