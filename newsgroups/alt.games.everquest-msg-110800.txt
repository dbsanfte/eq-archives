No, no, no...I'm not talking about the "ghost pointer" issue.  I like my
high resolutions, but sometimes I tend to lose the little bugger mouse
pointer when there's lots of stuff flying and I might have move the mouse a
little too fast.  I know if I right click and hold it will resurface in the
center of the screen, but with a bard as a main I have to keep my twists up
and this detracts from it.

Is there any way to enlarge the mouse cursor in EQ without reducing
resolution?

TIA,
SEAN...
