Well, I can only go on what is told me by people ingame. Beleive me, I
don;t rely on just one source. When something doesn't stack up I
question the information I get... And the source I get it from. :)

I learned from my UO days that digging out this kind of detail from
official and un-official web sites eats up more time than I want to
spend. So, I come here and ask... and I listen to all the replies.
