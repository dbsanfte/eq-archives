Druids aren't optimal for pling casters. The best class for them is
one that can wipe aggro - bard is exceptionally good. Though if you're
pling enchanter you can use any dps class and let the *enchanter* wipe
the aggro - makes enchanter easier than the other three. With magician
and necro you can buff the shit out of the pet like you would a melee
(no buff level limit on pets!) - still tends to be slower though.

In general though pling casters is longer and harder than pling
melees.
