Ok, does this bugger ever show up any more?  

I'm not a hardcore player, so camps vs. grouping are tough calls for
me, but I finally decided to start after my epic - or pieces of it.

So, I've spent 5 nights underwater now on the top floor of the goblin
tower.  Each night for around 3 - 4 hours.  I've been killed by Deep
once (whoops!  Watch that targetting there ye dumb dorf!) and by a
corrupted who had waaaaay more mana than I did.  Killed everything
else countless times.  Hell, even got 2% exp off of the numerous
cyans.  I've helped 3 druids get their pretty water.  

But have yet to even SEE Bergurgle.

Am I doing something wrong with respect to placeholders (like, are
they not on the top floor) or is he really just that rare?
