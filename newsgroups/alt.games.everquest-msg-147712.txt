Bullshit, it was a tribute using the medium of the person paying the
tribute to communicate.

It wasn't 'comparing' the two in any way. Anyone with an IQ greater than
their shoe size can see that. In EQ and RPGs in general, the term 'hero'
is thrown about constantly. Woody was showing a real life hero alongside
a fictional RPG one in his own stylised manner of drawing. We may play
as being 'heroes' in a fantasy game, those firemen at 9/11 (and
everywhere) are heroes every damn day in real life - no exp res for
them.

Besides which, if you DID think it was comparing the 9/11 firefighters
actions to those of a few pixels in a game, and you and your friends
found that *funny*, you're a bit sick in the head. Go play in the
traffic, little boy.
