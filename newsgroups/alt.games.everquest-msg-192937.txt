Perhaps the clearest way to state it is that the account key is contained on
the CD.  Since you want two accounts, you need two account keys, so you need
two sets of CDs.  Just Sony's way of saying, "Our game, our rules, our
profit".  It does tend to put a lid on the CD copying thing.  Once the
account is created, the only thing the CD is good for is restoring the same
account.  I haven't ever quit, but I assume once an account is closed, the
same CDs can be used to open a new account.

Cheers,
Eric
