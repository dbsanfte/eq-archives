No, it was to whine about being caught breaking the rules.

No, we really didn't. Don't confuse the way a thread gets derailed onto a
sub-topic with us not understanding that you got caught breaking the rules
and were punished for it, and then decided to whine about it.

There is no censorship in WoW.

Which would be relevant, if that's what you did. But you called someone a
pussy, and not just that, but used l33tspeak to deliberately bypass the
filter.

They have never handed out such a suspension to me, and they "possibly
could". Therefore your premise is fundamentally flawed.

 Oh, and ps: You are a moron.
