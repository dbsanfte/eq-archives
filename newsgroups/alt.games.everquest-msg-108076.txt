If you're acting like a pompous buffoon and someone tells you so, the
fact you don't agree doesn't mean they have no point. However, it
seems you're as thick-headed when it comes to what the word "point"
means as you are when it comes to dealing with CS.

><--- This is me caring. No really. I do. Really.

As is made obvious by the fact that you're STILL trying to defend your
"reputation".

Don't bother. You're only making it worse. Let me save you the
trouble. *plonk*
