OK, so if you don't have SoW on, you're fucked.  If you're a necro (who is 
almost NEVER at 80% health), you're fucked.  If you don't have gate, 
you're fucked.  Nice to know you care so much about all the other classes.

Ummm, you ever see how a bard charm-kites?  We sure as hell don't run the 
entire time, and we sure as hell can't stand there and take it for 30 
seconds if we have two mobs beating on our ass.  I've died from LD 5 times 
in 1 day, due to a telco problem.  Not a damn thing I could do about it 
other than find a cleric, pay PP for rez, and then finally figure out that 
the disconnects HAVE to be on my end somewhere.

Sorry, a solution that only fixes the problem for you is not only useless, 
it's causes a lot more problems than it solves.  And any caster who 
consistantly loses multiple hours of playing due to repeat LD is 
a) such an ass that he has no friends and no money to get a rez
b) playing at extremely odd hours when there's not a cleric within 3 zones
c) an ass who doesn't understand that his connection isn't good enough to
   solo
d) a whiner
e) all of the above.

Bullshit!  Why don't you come on a raid with any high-level guild.  
Casters die all the time.  Hell, I've seen my guildleader die 20 times in 
a night, and he's a NECRO!  I don't want to count the times that a caster 
died because they moved into melee range to cast and then went LD.

OK, so you want soloing to not only give more experience than grouping, 
but also to be safer?  Remember that bit about risk vs. reward.  
Remember that bit about class balance.  Certain classes can already 
solo much better than most, and you propose that you take away that 
risk?  Here's a rock, bite it.
