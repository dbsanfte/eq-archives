  It's interesting to me how different people can
play the same character class so differently.
My rangers uses her bow all the time.  My strategy
is to pull with snare, then root them.  Soften them
up a (very) little with flame lick, then alternate
the bow with casting my best DD, which right now
is Ignite.  If root breaks too fast no problem, with
snare I have plenty of time to cast it again.
I usually get them down to half hit points or
so doing this, then I melee them.  If they're
hitting especially hard, I'll try casting Ignite
during the fight as well (usually get at least
a couple off).  
   My bow skill is usually maxed very quickly
after I ding.

           ends a fight OOM, but sometime with full
           hitpoints or close to it.
