Thanks again to Lokari, Sean, Handy, Arolpin, and all the rest. Some new
information, and updated answers to things you asked. Easy stuff first:

I dont' have a DVD player.
The sound connections below where the video cable plugs in are hardwired
to the mobo and can not be moved. (removes case cutting around things as
an option.)
The card is definitely *not* a PCI card (though this has sparked an
interesting idea I'll ask about below.) However, through talking to IBM
tech support late last night, I found out it's not actually a "true" AGP
setup either. The tech guy said it was a (hang on to your hats. He had a
very heavy asian accent and I'm not positive of these letters) "NLX AGP
adaptor".  I don't know what this means, but I sure don't like the sound
of it, much as with everything else I've learned about this box from
hell.

He also described the card as a "Low Profile video card". Just to
satisfy my own morbid curiousity and beat myself up a little more, I
bravely asked him if IBM, perchance, sold an upgraded version of the
card that would be akin to the 64 MB RAM geforce I just installed in my
wife's Gateway. 

"No. We don't. We do carry a 32 MB RAM card for it, though."
"Oh. Really? And how much might that cost me, if I may ask?"
"Let me check.............. 219 Dollars."
[Sputter.... Cough........ Hack........]

Ok. I've already determined that with the money I've already flushed
into this system, I simply cannot go out in good concience and buy/build
a new gaming machine. Upgrading to 32 MB RAM is simply not worth the
risk, as the Gateway works "well" with 64 MB RAM video, but I'd be
doubtful of my luck with 32 MB RAM.

Here's the options I would like to consider, along with a question for
you wiser heads:
First, of course, I can just stop playing EQ until I win the lottery or
feel comfortable that I can blow another 1500 bucks on a real gaming
machine. (No EQ? Eeeeeeeeeeeeeek!)

Second, I can start shopping around on the web for a 64 MB RAM version
of this mysterious NLX AGP low profile video card, hope to find one, and
hope it works in my machine and costs less than Fort Knox. (I'll be
looking this morning).

Third; Earlier on, somebody mentioned fudging with the "AGP Aperture
Settings" for the video cards to improve performance. I looked on my
Dxdiag.exe readout for some indication of what mine was set at, to see
if I could kick it up another notch, as Emeril would say. I don't see
how to do this. How would I, and could this boost the performance of my
current card and make EQ somewhat playable for now?
 
Last..... (Crosses fingers and toes and looks like a hopeful puppy dog.)
and this is the one I have a question for ya'll about. I have four or
five open PCI slots on my riser card. I've already located a very
reasonably priced Geforce2 MX 400 64 MB RAM video card online which is
PCI for a price equivalent to what the AGP for the Gateway cost. Hell, I
even found one in a local store for not much more. If I yank out my NLX
AGP low profile Matrox video-card-from hell, and just leave that slot
empty, and install a PCI based video card in one of my empty PCI slots
on the riser board, assuming I have the drivers ready to install, will
windows find the card, figure out that I want to use that one, let me
install the drivers, and get to work? This could be an excellent fix to
my problems, but I don't want to invest in the PCI video card if my
machine will *ONLY* work with this NLX AGP slot.
