I'm glad you had fun, but with all due respect, there's no way a group
like that should be pulling singles unless there's some serious newbie
issues going on. For one thing, why wasn't the tank pulling? No bow?

What would have been done in the groups I am used to would be the
Warrior would go and get four or five mobs and bring them all back.
Two enchanters could handle that even if both were clinically
braindead. Much more fun, interesting fights and probably at least
double the experience with the pull time removed.
