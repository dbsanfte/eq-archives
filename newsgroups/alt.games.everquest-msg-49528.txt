Hmmm... well, after my own little break from EQ, I did try logging on
again. Things go on, Norrath still turns. People come and go, same kind
of people. It's a whole microcosm of society, which is why it enthralls
so many people. It's too bad that as far as the game in there goes, it's
not so great. EQ should be a decent enough game by itself, and not use
people to fill in the gaps so cynically.

I doubt that I'll play as slavishly as I did before, but I'll definitely
not let it take up so much of my time and thoughts.
