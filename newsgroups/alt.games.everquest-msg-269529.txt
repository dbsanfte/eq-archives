Which is a completely sound bevaviour and a good training for mobs to
stay focussed on their task. Remember: first run back to your spawnpoint
and ignore whatever is on your way. "But there's a little tasty
hobbit..*bonk* STAY FOCUSSED!"

Afterwards jump everything in range. Yeah! ;)

By the way how do you know whether this wanderer is roaming or just
returning to his spawn? Does he wield a "Do not disturb" sign? :D
