Yes,imagine they would have invested the money they took from
the EQ players to develop EQ2 to make EQ better,what about
countries outside the U.S.,marketing,merchandising,advertising etc.
for EQ is nonexistant in Europe.
Eq is so much deeper than WoW,the landscape is overwhelmingly
huge now,quests are endless,it even has become somewhat
newbie friendlly during the last year,most would like EQ Graphics
style better than WoW's.
If they would have done proper advertising,subscriber numbers
could have been much higher now.
They even managed to drive their hard core customers aways,
for the 1st time I wont buy the next expansion,because I am too
angry about SOE.
WoW is the number one selling game in Germany,and I am not
talking about online games only,while on the other hand I
never saw EQ or EQ2 in any sales chart in Germany.

Well,as you said,too little,too late.
