Am I going blind or does it not light up on Halas?  That would make me
quite upset.  While its not a major hassle to run from Qeynos to Halas, it
would be oh so nice to be able to just "port" over to my homeland (and the
best newbie zone in the game :)

Also another thought.  I feel that these portals should have some sort of
level restriction on them.  Personally I loved the thrill and danger of
making the run from Qeynos to Freeport during my lower levels (and was
quite a character builder).  It seems that this will make going from place
to place way too easy.  I think that people need to go out and explore
Norrath a little bit, its amazing how big(*coughKARANAScough*) and
beautiful the zones actually are.

I dunno, perhaps im just getting soft, but sometimes Ill just run around
the lands eploring new places, seeing new sights, meeting cool people,
although im sure its evident as my highest character is level 36 :).  But
it just seems people dont do that anymore, its all about the XP grind, and
the mass plat gathering, this will only further push players toward that.
I still Role Play on my server(Nameless) whenever I can, and I encounter
fewer and fewer people who do.

Meh, sorry about the tangent I went off on, its just that I have mixed
feelings about the new portals.  I think it will be great for higher
levels who dont have direct access to a Wizard or Druid to get a teleport,
but really feel there should be some level restriction (say level 20).
The newbies need to explore a bit, become amazed by the sites they will
see and frightened by the monsters that will end up chasing them across a
zone.
