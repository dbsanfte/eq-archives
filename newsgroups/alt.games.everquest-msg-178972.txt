   Man, I must really be a horse of a different color.  I've had
KEI exactly once, when a friend bought it for me (level 34 cleric
me) before we went out on a hunt.  It was nice.  Very nice.  But
hardly transforming.  I can still play my characters without the
buff.

     Groups I'm in often base the pull rate on my mana.  Maybe if
I had KEI constantly the pulls would be non stop.  But I don't
exactly seem to be telling them to hold pulls (or "crying" as
they sometimes call it) all that often.  /shrug maybe I'm just
not at a level yet where it matters that much.  I have the same
theory as to why I don't get aggro that often.
