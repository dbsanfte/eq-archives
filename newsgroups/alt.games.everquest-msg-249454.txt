Hide only works on undead which are coded incorrectly.  Which, sadly, is a
suprisingly high number.

For Rogues only, Hide works as a combination Invisibility and Invisibility
to Undead at the same time.  At that point, the mobs which will see you are
a small subset that have permanent see invisibility or who buff themselves
with that spell.    Then in Rogue AA, there is Shroud of Stealth, which
makes you invisible to even those mobs.  A SoS rogue can only be seen by a
very small amount of random mobs which can see through the ability (one of
the several nerfs it has recieved since it was added.)
