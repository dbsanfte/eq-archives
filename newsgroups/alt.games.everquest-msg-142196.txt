It was just explained to you.  Which part didn't you understand?

Clerics, druids, and shaman are all the leading religious figures of
their societies, if you want to take that view.   In a view strictly
from the society that produces clerics, the closest class to them is the
Paladin, a warrior/cleric, with both druids and shaman being unlearned,
"earthy"-types without the knowledge necessary to perform the higher
clerical arts.  Neither statement invalidates the other.

Within the EQ world, it's arguable that the latter view is more of
the "Vision."  Druids and shaman both have nature-based attack and
beneficial spells which the cleric doesn't get and give up healing
power in return.
