Thats pretty much what I'd concluded, although I'm surprised you mention soloing
as a use for the fungi - generally I went AC and swapped in the fungi when
I got low for a lil kiting once out of melee range. I dont solo much any more
though, although I still make a point of equipping our guilds warriors with
giant monocles and sniggering whenever they start to try and rag on rangers :)

The reason I ask though, is that I *always* have regrwoth of the grove up, as
I am never online without Perl, my hierophant partner in crime. So, I wonder
if the additional AC is worth the halving of regen rate (or however much it
is) and the smack to dex (for slow procs)/ac/hp.

As for "hey it could happen", I am *regularly* MA. Luclin was good to me ;) Its
not like there are many XP camps a 60 ranger with 1200 odd AC and 4k HP cant
MA. Hell, I was MA'ing from level 56 in chardok ;)

Warriors are nice and all, and so are clerics, but really the safety margin is
absurd given the relative ease of most XP camps with the gear available now.

The only place I dont MA regularly is on raids. And I've tanked off in ToV and
MA'd a dragon. Once. For fun ;)
