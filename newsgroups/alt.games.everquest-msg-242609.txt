Meanwhile, almost one thousand Mexicans crossed the border illegally.

If another year has gone by then another million or two Mexicans and other
third world refugees have been given "amnesty" by whoever is President.

The government (Washington D.C., Wall Street, Universities of note,
and Fortune 500 corporations) are traitors. We need a lot of rope and
a lot of strong trees.
