I am using an old pc since my other one has died, and disabled sound with
the trick of putting nosound.txt in my eq directory. I've since removed the
file but still have no sound. The options (alt o) show sound set to full and
other games work fine. Can anyone tell me why eq is still acting as if that
file was there? Is there an ini file i need to edit?
