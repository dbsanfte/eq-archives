I did droga before the change, but it wasnt mindless, it was good fun ;)

I'd go grab as many goblins as I could with panicking - some harm touch
and stuff - and scurry back to the enchanter and druid with me who would
proceed to AE the bejesus out of them, and hope they didnt die while I
spot healed with my uber ranger heals ;) It was a giggle :)

The tradeskills are killer though, its true. Fortunately the Coldain Ring
skills are either easy or MQable...
