Inside the game, you *ARE* your character. If your character can't see
the action because they are in deep meditation to regain mana, then you
can't either. Plain and simple. When you make level 35, as the in-game
explanation makes clear, you're finally good enough to meditate without
being transfixed on your book.

If they remove this from the game, I'll be pissed. I can sympathise with
Tiru, who finally graduated from "the book" some sixteen levels ago. And
I have a "book" character who will break through in another ten levels.
It's a rite of passage, and gives the caster something to really aim
for. A goal to achieve at level 35. Plus, everyone before you had to go
through this rite of passage. Real nice "gift" for all the level fifty
plus casters out there to have VI suddenly let every caster in the
newbie garden sit/med at level one. The interface isn't "broken" with
that spell book stuff. That's how it was designed, and the reason for it
has been given, and is valid.
