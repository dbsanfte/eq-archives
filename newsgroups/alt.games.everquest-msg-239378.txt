Yeah, that was the original bug.  The warp to zonein when you tried to enter
the room was added to the servers (mostly Euro) who hadn't been patched a
new version of the (working) trial.

Man who cares where you could bind, even if you could bind inside ToV at the
zonein, ever tried to recover an nToV wipe, especially when kos to CoV?
Man, just try getting into NToV once you were back inside ToV!

As you already answered it - you didn't raid those zones - I guess you got
to the raiding scene when death and CR had been toned down.  The game wasn't
always like this though, and the dumbing-down change certainly wasn't good
for everybody.

Well \shrug, it was a genuine question.

There isnt much room for skill or flair to stand out, on a 1 group trial,
when talking about the first mob in the zone, with only 1 method or strat of
killing it.

5 people / 1 cleric > 6 people / 2 clerics (both groups having a rogue)

Thats crap =)  Anyway like I said my question was genuine.  From the sounds
of your post you made a real meal of a very simple encounter, so I figured
there was some basic thing in the fight you guys overlooked.

Mana and HP differences are very small nowadays, with PoTime being the sole
endzone for so long, the gap between guilds 1-2-3-4 (even more on other
servers) has been narrowed like never before.

Prior to PoP, it wasnt uncommon to have only 1 guild kill Emp Ssra for the
entire of the expansion, much less AHR.  Same deal in SoV, only 1-2 guilds
per server typically had killed vulak, or ST warders, in the lifetime of
that being the endgame expansion.

Nowadays thats not the case, multiple guilds hit the end of the game for
several months, they farmed and waited for months, so now most top-few
guilds are pretty much on level pegging as they race into GoD

If 5 chars, with 1 cleric from a potime guild can keep a warrior alive for
the duration of a short "easy" named, there is absolutely no reason why
another servers potime guild cannot do the same. For reasons above (and
others.. like only being 1 real armour choice per class in PoP) the
differences between the groups would of been minimal.

So clearly, if your group was wiping on the same mob.. something fundamental
was wrong.  Maybe that could of been identified.  Maybe it doesn't even
matter now /shrug

You know me, if i wanted to say you suck... I'd just say it =) I wouldn't
hint or beat around the bush. Arrogant, maybe, but straight - you know it.
