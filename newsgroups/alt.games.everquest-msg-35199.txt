Why spam here when you lie?
There are no everquest codes on that site (probably because there are
no everquest codes) and there is not even any everquest music!

Stop turning this newsgroup into a house of lies!!!!!

I will enjoy it when you put up a poll asking if you are an ingrate.

Your everquest "cheats" are certainly fantastic though!
I GO PL MY 55 DRUID NOW WITH THESE FANTASTIC HIDDEN "CHEATS"!!!!!


"Gain Exp in the hills
Go to Qeynos Hills and search for Rabid Grizzleys. They are about
level 12 to 14. Kill them (while watching  for Cros or Holly who will
kill your character because you are attacking animals), then steal the
rabid pelt off them. Take the pelt to the UFO in North Qeynos and hand
them into the Priestess wearing leather. You will get VERY good exp, 1
to 2pp and a spell (usually endure disease)."

OMG HOLY CODES AND CHEATS!!!


"Lower Level Exp gaining
Go to Qeynos Area before attempting this trick, and around level 2-4.
Once you reach level 3, go to Qeynos hills and kill Gnolls, Gnoll pups
, Gnoll scouts or Gnoll watchers. They may drop gnoll fangs. If they
do, pick it up and collect 4 (or more) gnoll fangs and take them to
the captain of the gaurds that overlooks the arena. Give him 4 teeth
at a time. He will give you lots of exp and 4 moonstones. Give the
moonstones to the bartender in the back of the bar in South Qqeynos.
He will also give you exp."

WOW THANKS FOR TELLING ME TO GO TO QEYNOS AREA FIRST TO GO TO THE
QEYNOS HILLS TO KILL GA NOLS! I WOULD NEVER HAVE FOUND!!!
WOW BUT NONE OF THOSE IN THE HILLS DROP FANGS.

GEEE.

Hey I have some secret EQ codes too!

1) Go out and hit things with the thing you have to hit stuff with.
The yellow or orange thing will get bigger and then you will level!!!
DON'T TELL TOO MANY!

2) TURN ON AUTORUN. IT is a huge cheat and you then just STEER.
WHEEE A WINNER IS YOU!
