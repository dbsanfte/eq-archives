	ahahahahahaha...no.

	Reminds me of a scene from the recent Zorro movie, where the old Zorro
(Sir Anthony Hopkins) is trying to teach the new Zorro (Antonio Banderas) how
to fence.  Banderas says "I already know.  This part," and he points to the
point "goes in the other guy".  Then he waves the sword around in a somewhat
flashy manner.

	Hopkins twitches his arm once and disarms him.

	Lots of real world weapons, including most swords, require a fair bit of
training before they can be wielded effectively.  In a level-based game,
having a level cap on the better weapons is perfectly reasonable.

	Adding magic to the picture completely queers the deal.  There are plenty
of examples in the fiction of magic weapons that can't even be drawn from
their scabbards or picked up off the ground if the would-be wielder is not
worthy.
