I have never once had that happen, nor have I ever been turned down due to 
not having KEI.  I most certainly have never done that to anyone else.  
Admittedly, at this point, my gear is probably such that even should 
someone inspect me, I would not be turned down, but that has certainly not 
been the case until relatively recently.
