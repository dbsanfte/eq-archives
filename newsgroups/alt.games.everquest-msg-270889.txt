I started out having no buffs at all. The few times I had gone
through pok at that point, I saw the /ooc requests, but ignored
them. 

But I got tired of gaming and spending most of the 20-30 minute
sessions I have time for during the week, waiting for my 'toon's hp
to go back up to 100 percent.

So I saw mentions of temp on web sites. Then I started using it
after gaming for about 2 months. December is my 6th month gaming in
EQ1.
