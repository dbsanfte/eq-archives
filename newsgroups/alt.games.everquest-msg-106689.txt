I'd say the figher, since at least he has the AC to handle a hop-along
guest.  Heck, he may even have more HP  than the fully health Wizard
(assuming the wizard didn't get hit).  If the figher is a Paladin or Ranger,
he's probably has enough mana to heal himself, so is in a condition to med
and still have the AC to ward off unwelcome guests.  Same with Monks and
mend.

If the Wizard doesn't get hit.  If he does, the he's tin foil.
