I'm perfectly happy to ignore anything that's not level 65, as with both of
my "main" characters that's the only part of the game that I deal with
anymore.  I realize that you're not there yet from your sig, but don't
worry, that part of the game you're in lasts for such a limited amount of
time compared to level 65 that what does and does not exist at your level is
pretty immaterial.  :)

However, at 65 root is definitely well ahead of charm, mez, FD and
unresistable debuffs in terms of usefulness.  Now granted my monk finds FD
to be a whole lot more useful than root, but for the most part those around
me are considerably more impacted by root than FD.  When the enchanter dies,
root still takes care of adds.  And unresistable debuffs...  eh.  Useful, no
doubt, but they just don't have that pizazz.  :)
