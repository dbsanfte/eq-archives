> What is the appropriate amount of donations for things like ports?

For folks running a taxi service, 10p seems to be pretty normal.

If your ooc is POLITE and you use FULL WORDS (never abbreviate) and mentions
why you would like the port, there's a better chance of getting it for free.

/ooc Would it be possible for some kind druid or wizard to port me to NK for
a corpse retrieval, please?

This is good.  If you add "Will pay if necessary" is BAD (IMO).  I read that
and translate it to mean "although it's your duty to port me for free, of
course, because mana is free," which is blatant BS.  Mana is neither free,
nor is it anyone's duty to give any stranger a buff or ride anywhere.  It's
a courtesy and unless you're hiring someone advertising as a taxi the
request had better be courteous.

Anyway, I'm rambling.  If someone tells you "donate what you feel is
appropriate" then that's what they probably mean.  If you're a non-twinked
level 23 ranger I don't think they'll be too disappointed or shocked to see
you pay only a few plat.  If you've been very friendly and not said the
dreaded "plz," I can guarantee you that *I* would not only refuse payment
but at the very least give you SoW as well.
