Someone posted a *great* idea on an EQ2 discussion board, suggesting how to
handle boss mobs, to get rid of the problem of one or two guilds
monopolizing them.

Whenever a boss mob dies, the server would add to a list the names of all
players that were on the hate list, and the time.  The mob would then
respawn fairly quickly, like ordinary mobs in the zone, rather than staying
down for a long time, like boss mobs currently do.

Remembered players stay on the list for a week.

If a player gets on the mob's hatelist, and is already on the remembered
list, the player is removed from the zone, like Naggy and Vox do now to
people over 52.  (Or, perhaps, they are deathtouched, if Verant wants to
more strongly discourage them).

The idea here is that you take out the boss mob, and then you can't take out
that boss mob again for a week, but the mob respawns quickly, so another
guild can have a shot.  You only get added to the boot list when the mob
dies, so unsuccesful attempts don't count against you.
