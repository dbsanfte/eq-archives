I just became Elemental flagged on Saturday. Been doing some xping and
racking up aas in PoE, but there is no map for the zone, and I would
like to learn more about it. Anyone know of a good guide for camp
locations, trap explanations, etc? I seem to remember one from rpg
experts from like 6 months ago, but I cannot find it.

Thank you for your help
