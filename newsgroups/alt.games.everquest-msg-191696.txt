Well... There are people who play the game just to see ever-bigger 
numbers accumulate, and there are people who actually enjoy pretending 
to exist in a heroic fantasy milieu. For those people, having the name 
of a brand of pet food waved in their faces is not unlike having 
someone's mobile phone ring while they watch The Lord of the Rings in 
the cinema, it takes them right out of the state of suspension of 
disbelief in which they wish to place themselves.

Now, there is some merit in your assertion that so very few EQ players 
give a shit about any roleplaying aspects anymore, and those who do have 
been segregated to Firiona Vie, that names don't matter anymore. Fair 
enough, but since you picked a name against the rules out of spite, be 
ready for people to petition it out of spite too. Originally, Firiona 
Vie didn't exist, and every server was supposed to be a roleplaying 
server. I guess much of the blame falls on Sony's shoulders for not 
having the balls to enforce their own policies.
