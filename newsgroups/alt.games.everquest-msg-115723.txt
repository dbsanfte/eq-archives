Really helpful for faction spells and illusions. It's *possible* for
non-Enchanters to do the quest but it requires wolf-form and faction work.

Nope only way getting the tonic is in Erudin. I don't konw an easy way
around this. Your best bet is to kill as many kobolds in The Warrrens as you
can stand to. You'll eventually become non-KOS in erudin but I don't know if
that will make you able to do the tonic quest though.

You'll probably need Erudin Merchant faction, which is one of the harder
factions in the game to raise. I'm not for sure on this but you have to buy
a drink from a merchant to start the tonic quest and if he won't deal with
you you're dead in the water.


> 3. Honey Jam from Rivervale. I killed a halfling in Nektulos.

You can try doing the bandages quest. I think if you turn in enough bandages
you may be able to do what you need in Rivervale, but you'll remain KOS to
the wandering cleric so it's pretty dangerous.

Well since you're a necro you could just kill the Kolandil fish in the pool
of life in Qeynos for the fish corpse. I did the quest yesterday and got the
fish from Frostbite as normal, I don't think that's changed.

I watched an indifferent (wolf form) gnome turn in the Book to Clurg without
getting a Stein. I think Amiable is correct.

Since you're level 10, the warrens probably isn't the best place for
Kobolds. There are several kobold camps in Toxx with 3rd level or so Kobolds
that give the same positive faction hits as the Kobolds in the Warrens.

There's also a pickled Froglok quest you can do to rais faction with Clurg.
Basically you hunt Frogloks for thier meat, pickle it, and hand the pickles
in to the female Ogre standing near Clurg. This will give you positive Ogre
faction. There's also a dwarf in the back of the Mnio caves in Steamfont who
you can kill for faction. However since tye place is crawling with Minos I
don't know how doable this is for you.

You'll also need Kiola nuts from Sister's Island where you're KOS. The
sisters are on one of the main wood elf factions I believe. You could raise
your faction with them by killing orcs in Crushbone but that'd hurt some of
your dark elf factions.

Good luck on the quest.
