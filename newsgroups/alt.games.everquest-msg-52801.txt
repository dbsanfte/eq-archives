Excuse me?  You do know that you can bind in City of Mist, right?  If
you're alligned with the Coldain I guess it's an easier run, but CoM
to Seb is closer than Kael to Velks.  Either way, I can't remember the
last time I had to run back to either of those dungeons after a death.
Where are you fighting in Seb that you don't have a cleric?  Certainly
not any deeper than the guard camp, and there is always another cleric
around to rez if you get wiped out.
Are you afraid to fight in Chardok and Siren's Grotto too?  Maybe this
is why people whine that there's noplace to fight.

Why?  If melee could bind anywhere, it would be way, way too easy to
just die, grab your weapons, and head back in.  At least with a battle
rez you have to deal with rez effects making tanks pretty much
worthless as damage dealers.
