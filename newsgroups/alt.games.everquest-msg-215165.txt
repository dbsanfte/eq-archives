Oh thank GOD it happened to someone else, I thought I was losing my frickin'
mind.  Ok, now that I know it's not just me....

...I went to www.everquestlive.com and looked over the tech support forum
and the knowledge base.  No joy in either place.

I'll likely move my opt & ini files to another folder & log back on & see if
the problem disappears.  Since it seems to be universal to that computer,
it's undoubtedly a file that does not have a character name in it.
