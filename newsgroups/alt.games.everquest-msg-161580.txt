Rumor has it that part of the PoP new content will eventually be an "Epic 2",
where you hand in your curent epic for upgrade to a new, better epic.  Remember
that the original epic was obtainable under level 50, and the rest were designed
to be around that hard (sure, a bit harder, but not "groups of level 60s with
SoL gear" and certainly without PoP in mind)

It would certainly make a lot of people happy to see a new reward put in place
for having gone thru all the hassle of getting your old reward... and if they
take some player feedback about what is good and what is bad in an epic, should
be enjoyable for people who actually thought the game should center around
"quests" like in the name.

ps Regretfully, based on my earlier stance, I have to admit the cleric epic
doesn't belong on this "worthless" list, although its not something you want to
hold in hand, you'll always pack it along in inventory, and hope the enamel
doesn't wear off the clicky button anytime soon.  I'd still love it to become
something worth weilding, though.
