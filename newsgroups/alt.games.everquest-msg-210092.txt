XP is split up the same. However, class and race do modify the xp
needed to level -- race more than class these days. Certain classes
have the xp split the receive multiplied by a certain amount to offset
their class-based xp penalty (rogues and warriors still have slightly
lower xp requirements, though). Large races and Iksar have the most
noticeable increase in xp requirements, though.

The end effect, a halfling rogue grouped with, say, an Iksar Monk will
level faster, despite the fact they're both getting the same split of
xp.
