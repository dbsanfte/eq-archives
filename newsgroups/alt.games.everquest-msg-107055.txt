Ok due to the LARGE number of replies we recieved via Email into our
last thread and considering I can't seem to find that thread yet
(sorry google groups is slow to update).
If you wish to participate in the beta testing of our new auctions
section, go to http://auction.accesgame.com/
And create an account.
Please note this part of the site hasn't "gone live" quite yet and may
still have some bugs in it.
Therefore this disclaimer
The site may or may not be up and down over the next few days as we,
are adding to and adjusting the auction engine.
Also we do not accept auctions that deal with "insider info", "bug
info" or guides.
Our auctions are for in game items only and plat.
As well as auctions on peoples time (Power Leveling).
Therefore please stay on topic.
Sincerely
Rage Mage

As for everyone else I apologize for taking up bandwidth by starting a
new thread.  However the "old" one just isn't showing up in my
newsreader yet.
