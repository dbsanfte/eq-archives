The quest is called something like the "supply run",  it involves running to six
different cities and buying an item in each, then combining them in a box and
handing them to Trep.

Five of the items cost around 5pp each, the sixth a few silvers, and you get 60pp
from Trep for the service.

If I recall correctly, you have to go to

Freeport
Thurgadin
Bazaar
Qeynos
Shadeweaver
and Firiona Vie

All these are POK ports in the same section of town, my bard's best round trip
time is 23 minutes.  At 46 this was worth about 5% exp per run, or about the same
exp as soloing, but almost entirely free of risk.  By 50 its down to about 3%, or
slower than soloing... but even less risky.  I hear that you cannot do the quest
at levels under 35 (well you could go buy all the items, but can't get the box
from Trep to do the combine)

The OP is saying that the exp per trip drops off as you repeat it, until the
server is reset.  That would be an interesting new data point, I don't have an
exact percent display on my UI, and I never did the quest that many times in a
row, mostly I used it to do the final couple blue and the first blue or so in a
level, because I've noticed that is where I tend to die... pushing past where I'm
too tired to play a bard in hopes of getting the next level before going to bed,
and busy playing with a new song so stuff that used to be easy kills me.

Doing it as an AA quest... hmm, I might have to try that, wonder if it works at
65!
