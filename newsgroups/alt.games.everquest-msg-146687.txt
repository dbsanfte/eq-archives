I guess i was thinking of newbies as they probably wont have experienced 
how cool levitation is in this game.
Some mid level characters probably have.
I wasnt really thinking of it as a major money maker bt just something 
fun that some people might like to try
Especially off high hold pass, that is so high you can see the bottom 
*gulp*
Better try it first myself though in case its bugged or something
