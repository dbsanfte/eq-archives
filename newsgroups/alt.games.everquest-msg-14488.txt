Agreed.

Though I was interested to note that my support of Verant, in respects
to their early claims that the zone in question was complete, was
misplaced. Oh well, not the first time, and probably not the last. It
was still the right way to bet, and wasn't really relevant to the
actual issue anyway.

I skimmed the most recent exchanges that have been posted, and it
appears there can be no doubt that exploits were knowingly used by the
guild. So screw them.
