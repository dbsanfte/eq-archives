This is a bug . It should not reload the zone if you same zone port. Notice
that it is usually better for you for it to do so. Most inner zone ports are
used to escape a mob that is eating your ass and then to camp out and in to
break aggro. If it reloads the zone then it also cleaned up all the aggro
lists and you got off easier not harder.
