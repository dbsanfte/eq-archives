Is it just me or when you try and connect to the server and its down and you
get a busy please try again later. So you try and exit and it just locks up.
Or you try again and it locks up.

This has been happening like for the last year... wonder is anyone else gets
it, as its starting to piss me off big time with the reset and scan disk etc
etc etc
