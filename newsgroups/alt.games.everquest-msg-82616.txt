I think stretching it to silver emerald is going a bit too far. The
electrum malachite costs 3 pp a pop. I'd keep working with silver at
least till amber trivials (35) and maybe till topaz trivials (44), but
I'd switch to electrum malachite (74) no later than after topaz.
At topaz, there's a huge price jump from 6 pp (topaz) to 11 pp
(peridot) and then 15 pp (emerald), and emerald trivials at 48. In my
opinion, the higher cost of those 4 points wouldn't be compensated by
higher success rates, especially since everything fails often at that
skill level.
