A friend's 50+ monk had the name, "Xtermin Ator".
As far as I can tell that wasn't even against the
naming rules, but one time he petitioned about a
corpse problem and the GM decided to mutate his
name to "Brazin Incognito".

Like that's any better?

Meanwhile, the rogue "Duzit Frombehind" kept his
name even after a senior Guide and an apprentice
Guide stood having a conversation with each other
in the Freeport bank for 20 straight minutes
with "Duzit" standing right there between them afk.
