Which is in no way relevant to how accurate Dennis' comment is.

The poll is an attempt to measure the users' priorities, presumably
so that they can direct their (necessarily) limited resources in a
way that will make the most users the most happy (or most willing to
keep sending them money anyway).  Personally I would translate the
question slightly differently than Dennis:  "do you care if things
remain as fucked up as they are?", to which my answer was "no" (for
the same reason as Faned gives above).  Apparently Dennis feels
differently, but then I suspect more of the currently fucked-up
things affect him than me.  The choice was a little difficult tho,
character shadows would be an extraordinarily stupid thing to add
to the game as it is, IMO.  Hopefully they'll shove the developer
who wants to add that onto some other team.
