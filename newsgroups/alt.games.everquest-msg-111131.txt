Do look into hand to hand weapons; old school HtH was done bare
handed, using strictly your native stats.  Now, however, you can instead
use the HtH skill with the stats of a specialized weapon.

This means you can get the same advantages you see in other melee
skills; higher damage/delay ratio, lower delay for more skill rolls, and
more bonus's.  At very high levels, holding no weapon may give you
a better damage per minute output than anything you can find, but when
just starting out a rusty dagger probably does more damage output than
your naked fists.

Also, many of the HtH weapons, like those for the other weapon skills,
have stats and HP on them; one liability of the "nothing in my hands"
weapons training was that it mean losing stat/HP bonuses off two whole
slots on your body.
