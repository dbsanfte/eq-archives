I think part of it is that the photoshopped-in features are human.  I have 
no objection to the singing cats in a meow-mix commercial, even though 
there's obvious photoshopping involved.  The stuff on Leno and Conan is 
also usually human features on a human background.  I think the mixing 
human and rodent is what turns the stomach.  But it could be that the eyes 
don't move or blink.  Or the eeeky whiny voice.  That's what really gets 
me.  It bugs me even if I'm not looking at the TV.  My GF is pretty quick 
with the mute button, though.
