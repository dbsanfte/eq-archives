As with most jokes, it's not so funny the second time.

The crashing wasn't just on zoning.  It was quite an insidious bug,
actually.  The bug wasn't triggered until the server reached a
certain minimum load level and stayed there for a while.  The code
in question had been in use for a while on Test, but it had never
been loaded heavily enough to set off the bug.  At least that's what
they claimed in the aftermath and I can see no reason to doubt them.

C'mon man.  SOE is a business.  They're in it to make money.  As long
as they are making anough money to keep them interested they'll keep
doing the things that have worked so far.  If/when profits shrink
(guess what reduced margins do?) all bets are off.  People inside SOE
will present plans and business cases to management types who (likely)
have nothing at all to do with EQ.  These folks will in turn choose
what to do.  I, for one, am not eager to see the day when EQ's future
is being decided by some MBAs in suits who are totally disconnected
from the game's community.

There have been plenty of content bugs that necessitated downtime.
Orc Pawns in Crushbone dropping 999pp999gp999sp999cp is probably
the most famous.

I guess we'll just have to be punished then.  :-p
