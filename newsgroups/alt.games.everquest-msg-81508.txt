I am not sure if this is a problem of just crappy luck.  Prior to today,
I leveled up in tailoring in a normal leveling.  It was difficult, but
not impossible.  Some of the worse I had was 20 attempts per point of
increase.  Prior to the patch I had leveled to 151.  Suddenly, today, I
started working on my tailoring again.  I finally got to 152 after a
total of 67 combine attempts.  None of these were trivials and I had a
90% success rate making Wu Armor Tunics.  I immediately reported it as a
grave problem.  The biggest losers in this is the poor guys that must
compete with me for the Silks in East Karana.  I am very Uber and as
such, I find the Spidies faster and do "No-Mana" kills on them, result,
I am a non-stop killer of spiders, they go away very unhappy.  but as I
always tell them, "Please, complain to Verant and the GMs that the big
bad Uber is killing the spiders, it is after all their fault"  This
time, I am not sure if it is their fault or just that maybe the latest
assault of bugs from a patch has not possibly caused something to go
haywire.
Thanks for reading.
