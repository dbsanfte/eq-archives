And the froglok tad tongues are also used for a quest in Swamp of No
Hope.  Go to Captain Nedar (I think he's in the balcony of one of the
buildings in Swamp of No Hope by the entrance).  Give him four froglok
tad tongues and you'll get a random item, money, experience and
faction boost.  I believe Captain Nedar only shows up during Norrath
daytime hours.
