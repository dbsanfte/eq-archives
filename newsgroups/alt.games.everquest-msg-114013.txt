   Heh.  I did that.  Won a sucker bet with Lenny doing it. 
"Honey, I bet our usual wager that I can survive a jump into
the Hole!"  "You're on, Wench!  There ain't no way in hell
'cause I found out the hard that that it strips lev when you
go....Hey!  You made it!  What's "Divine Aura"?!?  Ok, Ok...
cheating bitch...."  <Trudges off to the bedroom in utter
defeat...>
   Anyways, when I started this thread, I knew full well
that any class/combo can be played by a jerk.  Heck, for all
I know, there are a ton of jerks like that me that have alts
of just about every class and combo (you stick with the same
man for 17 year, you crave variety where you can get it. 
Try it.  Really).  Just was wondering about which
class/combo has a reputation for attracting the fewest
jerks.

forces her to settle down a bit.

-- 
Living in the universe known as Drinal
My current top 3 alts:

Teashot Benlen -- Wood Elf Ranger, 30, Casting Spirit of the
Wolf!
Tealeef Benlen -- Barbarian Shaman, 25, Killer of rich
gorillas.
Teadead Benlen -- Human Necromancer, 22, eyeing giants in
Warsliks Woods.

And on Firiona Vie:

Teapray  -- High Elf Cleric, 6, learning the languages of
the land.
