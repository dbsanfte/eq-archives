Also known as "shadow step" for Necros.  Yes, I too wondered "wth?"
when I tried it the first time in battle and ended up getting beaten
to a pulp 3 feet from where I'd started out, because I had to look
around to find out where I'd been moved to, and of course as soon as I
try to look around I lag and my screen freezes for 3 seconds or so -
yay spell :p

Ryou
(will admit the screen freezing is not Verant's fault - unless we're
talking Kunark/Velious/Luclin and I assume/PoP, in which case I'm
going to slowly and painfully kill them for trying to impress me with
graphics that kill me)
