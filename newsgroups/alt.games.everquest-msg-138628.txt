I don't have the answers to your questions but do have a few more of my own.
Which Rockhopper Hides are needed for the Acrylia items?  HQ only?  Are LQ
good for anything, and what about the Greyhopper hides?  Also there seems to
be a glaring lack of leather padding for sale in the bazaar.  I sold some I
had for what I thought was the going rate of 4pp ea, which would be about
80pp per stack.  Later I was in another zone and someone was auctioning a
stack for 500pp! Is this guy crazy?? or did I rip myself off???

Maybe some nice tailoring/smithing guru can answer both our questions :)
