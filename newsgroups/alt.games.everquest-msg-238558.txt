Does anyone know of a site out there that would have a screenshot of each Epic?
 I don't mean a screen shot of the right click description, but a shot of the
actual weapon in a character's hand?

I've seen just about all of them, but I don't believe I've ever seen the SK
epic.  Anyway, just curious if there is such a site out there somewhere.  :)

Thanks!
