Indeed - it looks like Mythic took the best course on this in terms
of graphics - the ability to swap out graphics engines relatively easily
will be a huge boon in keeping it updated.  I find that a far better

turn down the options" at which point it looks worse than another game
not developed for the top-end machines that don't exist yet.
