Nope, not much at all.  When grouped with healers, I made a point of telling
them not to heal me.  In my entire time in Paladul, I'd say 80% of my healing
was due only to troll + ICC regeneration, supplemented by occaisionally healing
myself a few times prior to pulling just in case of a large overpull.  Mana
went to slows, to DOTs (not always) and to healing other people who got injured
by accidentally getting aggro on adds.

Later in Marus Seru I needed to heal myself during overpull fights sometimes,
but rarely after them, in fact I was using canna and regen to take my HP down
some to cut down time, when I didn't have KEI.  Then in FM at the giants, I did
have to heal myself during some fights, which was amusing, I was healing early
in the fights, then later when my partner had aggro, I ended up using canna to
get mana to keep him alive with more heals.  Since canna gives less mana than
is needed to heal the damage it causes, this is silly behavior on the face of
it, but not having an infinite HP pool, I needed to stay alive thru the severe
beatings early on, then later I'd regenerated enough HP that I could spend some
of it without going into low HP aggro.

I always found it amusing each time I was using canna while actively being beat
on, like the incoming damage wasn't enough... but I could do things with the
mana that I couldn't do with the HP.
