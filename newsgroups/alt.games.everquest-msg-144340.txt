The fall of the Soviet Union was what made the US claim they won the 
cold war, not the other way around. Besides, that had absolutely no 
bearing on the fact that (except in Romania), the communist governments 
of Eastern Europe were replaced with almost no bloodshed. Much of the 
credit for this goes to the Red Army, which kept its cool all the way 
through.

This is how it works: A popular revolt can only succeed if the army 
takes the side of the people, and the army is a lot more likely to side 
with the people if they aren't being shot at with cop-killer bullets 
from automatic weapons.

Which means, if anything, that the status quo was a lot more entrenched 
and legitimized than in places like Poland or the Czech Republic.

What for, so they can get killed in even more spectacular ways?

Actually, no. I draw that conclusion because I have *plenty* of personal 
experience of countries where the population is not armed, and yet there 
is neither a lack of freedom, nor fear of the government turning rogue 
overnight.
