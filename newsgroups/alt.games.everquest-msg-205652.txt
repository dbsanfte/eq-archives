I've got a spam email harvesting program (and no, I'm not a spammer). The
way it works is this:
It starts on a few sites that are directories, such as yahoo.com, and starts
scanning their directories to get urls. Hits those
urls and starts harvesting email addresses. When it finds one, adds it to
the list (say bobthewizard@wierdisp.net) and then adds a dictionary of
common email addresses (determined both by the internal dictionary and email
addresses it crawls off of sites). Example: Fred@wierdisp.net,
barney@wierdisp.net, joe@wierdisp.net.

It also takes bobthewizard and adds it to the major ISPs/Email providers:
bobthewizard@hotmail.com, bobthewizard@yahoo.com, bobthewizard@aol.com,
bobthewizard@earthlink.com

It will also harvest out of newsgroups (downloads message headers only, for
the main email address). Note that for you nospamers out there, it actually
adds the whole address plus removes the words nospam and spam from
addresses.

But, when it comes down to it, the documentation tells you not to bother
with newsgroups. Most newsgroup users have very creative nospam addresses,
or complete fakes, and you can recover more email addresses in 10 min on the
web than in an hour scanning newsgroup headers.

And it's very good at scanning the web.
In 'stealth' mode it identifies itself as a major browser (randomly selected
but stays the same on each site), sends requests for all the pictures in a
page (doesn't actually get them, just makes requests), deals with cookies,
varies it's time between page requests to simulate a human looking at the
page, (doesn't really slow it down as it has up to 100 threads running at a
time), etc...
