Copper Coldain Insignia Ring
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP
AC: 1
+1 STR, +1 MR
WT: 0.1
Class: ALL
Race: ALL

The rest of the rings go up, so the silver is AC2, 2 STR 2 MR etc. etc. etc.

To get the copper ring, you need to combine 2 HQ Tundra Kodiak Hides and 2
HQ Snow Cougar pelts in a sewing kit (trivial 82) and hand it to Garadain
Glacierbane.

To get the 10th ring, you have to prevent EVERY GIANT FROM KAEL (and some
who aren't, from what I hear) from entering Thurgadin. If even one enters,
the city is overrun and the quest fails.

I know of one guild who keeps attempting this on Prexus. I hear they keep
failing.

Oh, and I found the 9th ring. It's called the Coldain Hero's Insignia Ring.
No info on the quest though.
