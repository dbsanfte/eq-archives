One which was far from humorous at the time, but still get's told with an
embarassed laugh was one of our guildies who was apparently down in the bottom
of the mines in a full group.  Hadn't been chatting with the guild at all,
apparently quite busy fighting. Then there was some down/med time, and he was
filling us in on what was happening, then silence, as the battles resumed.
  Next line of guild chat from him:
"EVAC! EVAC!  GTF OUT! WE'RE SCREWED!"
/pause 30
"CRAP!"
/pause 20
"Why the freak didn't you guys evac out!??!"

Otherguildie: "Ummmm....... Dariael?"
"Yeah? What is it?  Hang on, we got sort of a bad situation here."
Otherguildie: "Ummmm,.... Dariel? You're in guild chat."
/pause 30
"Oh maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan.. They're gonna hang me."
