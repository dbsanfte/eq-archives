I am in a guild but last night I was grouped with a guy that was trying to
convince me to join his guild since he has recently started a monk only
guild. He is an admitted twink, his main character being a lv55 mage or
something like that. He said he had loaned his Wu's Trance stick and Knuckle
Dusters to one of the other guys in the guild for a little while, and could
I loan him my  Fighting Baton for a little while. I said sure as soon as I
can borrow 700pp. I mean he was a nice guy and all and I'm sure he had
loaned his weapons just like he said, but I'm not giving anything to anyone
without some kind of security.  He said I should just trust him, and I said
I do, and he should just trust me to give him back his 700pp when he gave
back my baton.
