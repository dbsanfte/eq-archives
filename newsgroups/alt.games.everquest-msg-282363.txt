There used to be a decent forum on the playstation website but last time I 
checked the forum had disappeared.  I took that to mean that EQOA was 
declining.  Quick check, the board has been dead since Sept 2004, only has 
an archive available.  I guess you can hang around the official website if 
you are desparate for EQOA discussion.
