I use Allakhazam and I pay for the service.  I find it a great asset.
But I was curious.. EQmaps is under the http://www.flashlink.com
group and there appear to be some featuers that only a subscriber can
use.

Anyone use their service, and how does it rate for the Plat paid?
has a 9.95 fee for 4 month's.
How does it compair to Allakhazam / EQAtlas?

any other pay for services you would recommend?

as usual, thanks for your time.
