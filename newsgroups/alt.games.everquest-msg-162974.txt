Oy, tell me about it.  Sad how much it costs just to do a decent twink

Hm. Still 2k+ on EMarr.  I prefer the SCHWs for the extra stats and
AC.  But then I prefer to just get the best I can to begin with,
rather than having to rebuy every 20 levels or so.  As you can
imagine, this makes for few but *very* expensive upgrades. :)

It's amusing how many of my friends and guildies have seen me talking
about what kind of 1hs I saw in the bazaar and said "what do you need
1hs for?"
