What policy would you use?

One of the raiding orgs (guild alliance) on my server is having a
minor (read: no one allowed to flame on threat of banning :-p )
discussion on this issue:

The org raids three times a week. One of its member guilds, however,
is strong enough to raid the same targets as the org (with friends
invited, mostly from the org), and does so twice a week.

There are now some in the org who believe this is wrong and the member
guilds should not raid targets the full org would take because it
rewards those guildmembers and friends with loot without costing them
merit points from the org, essentially meaning those players get more
loot faster than those who don't go with the guild.

It should be pointed out, though it does indicate my bias, that those
complaining about this are not invited to said guild's raids because
they are jerks too many people in the guild can't stand to be around.

So... should the guild be kept from raiding the same targets? Should
the org take over the raids (therefore allowing everyone to go)?
Should things stay as they are?

(one further note: this is test so mob availability isn't in question,
theres always something for everyone to raid)
