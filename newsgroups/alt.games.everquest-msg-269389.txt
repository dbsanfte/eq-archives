AS someone who doesn't play EQ2 those numbers are pretty 
staggering...but there is a but:

I was under the impression that downtime in EQ2 is virtually 
nonexistent. Such that in EQ1, my soloing character spends 75%+ of his 
time regenning health/mana. Even at the low levels if I'm not being pok-
buff powerlevelled. Anyway, I'm suggesting that the number of kills you 
get per hour soloing in EQ2 is 4x higher... so now its 240:400 instead 
of 60:400. 240:400 isn't that bad, better than half, even. Plus you 
"know" EQ1... maybe the best spots for soloing in EQ2 aren't known... 
perhaps you could drag that 400 down a bit by heading 'elsewhere'. Or 
perhaps your equipment isn't as good as it could be. Or you could be 
doing more and or better quests.

And most importantly the real question is -why- does it matter if its 
400 kills to break 25? Is there enough content that you can do 20 kills 
in each of 20 places? Or are have you seen all there is to see of the 
25th level game in 40 kills.

In EQ1, levelling has gotten too easy. People gain levels so fast they 
miss huge chunks of content that would have been fun if they'd come out 
of PC/OT to try them. Perhaps EQ2s approach of slowing it down is a 
'good thing'??
