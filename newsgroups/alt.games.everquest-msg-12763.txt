When people ask me that question, I /petition them for harassment! ;)  Just
kidding.  But tell me, why do you think it is not only rude, but _very_
rude?  I get very annoyed when someone asks if they may inspect.  I might be
hunting, be swamped in tells and guildsays, etc... I do not need to take a
break to reply to a silly question like that!  I personally think it is very
rude when someone decides to waste my time and ask... so please don't!  If
you want to inspect, click away.  Of course, once again... if you want to
examine for roleplay value or to discuss something, then maybe ask but since
99% of players do not rp, I seriously doubt there is any reason for the vast
majority of players to ask.
