That is the theory that gets put forward the most, but I can't say I
agree with it, at least not in all cases.

Some of the very old timers here may recall that I was extremely
anti-twinking when I first arrived in the group (to the extent that I
ended up in a kill file or two).

I assure you that I was quite capable of twinking the living hell out
of any of my new characters. As one of the few tailors on my server
able to make backpacks then, I had at level 20 gear comparable to what
most level 40s had at the time, and 12,000 plat in the bank as well.

But I was still anti-twink.

My reason was a strong desire to play the game *as intended*, not to
try to work every loophole to my advantage. It had nothing to do with
jealousy or ability to twink.

So, just so you know not to paint all anti-twinks with the same brush.
