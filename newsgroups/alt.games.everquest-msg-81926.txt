Perception thingy I guess. A warrior can tank, save you with taunt, be the
MA on raids to hold aggro, pull fast with a bow, run around...
Clerics can be the important CH chain on raids, buff your AC, buff your HP.
These things are noticed by players .. they see their HP up, the mob being
puleld etc.

Wizards? They sit on their ass and stand up when they nuke. 

Now I'm just talking *perception* here. Clerics always sit on their ass
as well, but you know what I mean.

Even I wodnered about what wizards actually do in level groups, sitting 
most of their time and nuking a little in the end, while the nukes did not
even come remotely close to the damage out put of the 4 other melees.
I'ts why I never wanted wizards in my group in levelling.

Now I've been raiding bigger mobs lately (Vindi, ToV dragons, Tormax etc)
and I'd not want to do that without wizards ever again, seeing their 2000+
damage crit nukes etc. A lot of them help downing a mob real nicely.

Anyway .. it's all perception :) We shamans also seemingly spend all our time
on our ass. People notice our buffs, haste etc very clearly though.
