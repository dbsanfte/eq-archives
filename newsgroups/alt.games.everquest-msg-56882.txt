Same here. Moved over with a friend, and I know a couple of people that
moved from the same server, but that's about it. Having said that, I only
got on for 30 mins, had to get some sleep!

I'll post any information I can find about guild forming here, maybe if
there's enough interest we can form our own. Who knows? it's a whole new
dimension. Now, which of the Ranger guild masters can train me in French!
