No, Hymn doesn't just heal on the pulse, it boosts your regen rate for 2
more ticks
after the pulse.

The song analysis page is at
http://eqsongs.com/Songs/
in particular, Hymn -
http://eqsongs.com/Songs/Song06.htm

At 15 you can easily weave
Hymn
Anthem

and another of your choice
and get all the benefits of
the above pair.

Use socials to help you time your
songs (helps overcome a bad
connection because you're not
dependent on seeing the message
that your song took effect.)

Ask on the eqbards mailing list,
there were some great ones
posted there a couple of days
ago.
