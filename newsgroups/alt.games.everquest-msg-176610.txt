I feel your pain. I bought a used NEC 21" monitor a few months ago. I
came home from work the other day to see it had crapped out on me. You
know that bright dot old TVs used to get in the middle of the screen
after you turned them off? Take that dot and stretch it from the top
to the bottom of the screen with a noticeable dot remaining in the
middle. That's all I had left of a picture.

I do count my blessings though. That just forced me to put an older
17" back into service for a while.  :)
