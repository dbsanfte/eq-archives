I didn't really intend that they completely balance everything (although
they *said* they had.) I'm certainly not suggesting they nerf HGs, either.
It would however seem to make more sense to have some different types of
mobs drop a few more PP, and to spread them out around the game more.

And to go totally off topic: From a role play perspective, why are HGs the
wealthiest NPCs in the world, carrying around more pocket change than a
dozen nobles when they dress in rags and don't even seem to own a house of
some kind?
