I was hanging out with a GM last week sometime recently, and he 
demonstrated for me the "advanced invisibility for GMs" skill, that they 
use to observe what people are doing when they don't think a GM is 
watching.  He went invis, I put see invis on, couldn't see him, did a 
/who, he didn't show up.  But he was still there talking to me...

So yeah, a /who won't show you all the GMs that are on.  Shortly after 
that, he went linkdead.  It was amusing seeing a GM tormented by the same 
problem that plagues players all the @#$! time. :)
