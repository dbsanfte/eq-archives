	I didn't make it, I'm just holding them to it.

|All other Druid/Warrior races in EQ have Rangers,

	Yeah, BOTH of them.  (Half Elves are not a "race".)

	They are completely contrary.  There is no reason for them to exist, and
they are not in the character of the race.

|Your interpretation. "Halflings" are used throughout the D&D world as
|well.

	Where they are also cookie-cutter Tolkein ripoffs.

|But none...zero...nadda professional thiefs.

	That fact is not evident.

|There is no mention of religion or any reference to a Hobbit "priest"

|organized religion at all for any of the races.

	Which means you can't draw any conclusions about such.

|I will grant you a Tolkein Warrior Hobbit, but as noted above the EQ
|Halfling deviates completely when it comes to the ability to use
|magic, and the ingame lore associated with the race.

	The entire EQ world deviates completely on magic -- it's a non-issue here.

|All of the races/classes are "stolen" and "rip-offs" from
|high-fantasy. There isn't a single original thing in EQ.

	No kidding.

|content is bastardized and changed for use in EQ. My pointing out that
|EQ has stolen and bastardized content from the genre is not a
|"cop-out", it is a fact. EQ is it's own world, and can makes it's own
|rules. 

	And when it chooses to deviate from its own stereotypes, it can be called
out for it, too.

|So why do you insist on picking on Halfling's getting to be Rangers? 

	They don't make sense, and they're grossly unbalanced to boot.
