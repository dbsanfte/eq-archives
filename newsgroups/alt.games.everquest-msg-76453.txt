The one thing that I would really question here is why the paladin
stayed ?
He says that he is passing through.
He says that the gobos are green to him.
Its not like they are good loot (they are not)
I can't think of any faction farming that he would need to do there.

I would guess that he was going to solo the giant fort in WW for pp.
So what made him stop ?

Are you _sure_ that you did not say anything to him before he started
killing gobos?
You know like "Bog off this is our camp"
To which perhaps he replied "I'm just passing through"
and maybe you or you mate said something like "Make sure you do you lame
pali"
Then he could of thought something like "I know I will teach these
arrogent brats a lesson" thus starting the whole affair?

This is only a guess, and it is possible that the paladin was just a
really nasty bloke who did it just to piss you off, but I can't think of
another logical reason.

So either your story is the whole truth and the paladin is a total git
(Which seems odd for someone who is 30+)
Or the whole situation was a slow escalation from some lively talking
from you and your mate.

Not trying to cast doubt on you it just seems that there is something
missing from the story. I know I have never met anyone in the game who
behaves as illogically as you say the paly did for no reason.

Just my 2pence.

Jim
You did say comments/flames welcome.
