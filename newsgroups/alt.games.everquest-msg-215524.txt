    It's not all that great, because they come in at full mana with what
they're wearing (nothing). Unless you do the two-step, where you normal res
them then Divine Res them once they're in their gear, you're gonna get
someone at around 40% mana.

    Ooh, yeah, I forgot about the damage shield thing in my other post.
Those druid mobs in Takish can really be annoying that way, putting a
sizeable DS on everything in a room.
