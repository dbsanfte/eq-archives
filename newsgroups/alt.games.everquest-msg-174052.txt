Since the rest of your questions have already been answered, the answer to
this one is North Karana.  You get there from Qeynos by running east through
Qeynos Hills, then east through West Karana (as soon as you zone into WK
turn south and run to the river before heading east), then when you zone
into NK just follow the river until you see some big spires near the bridge.
Talk to the Nexus Scion there at the spires and get a shard and then just
hang out until the spires teleport you to the Nexus.  Go south to find the
Bazaar.
