I have read on EQ Atlas that they con Amiable, in that they are happy to see
some new dinner walking up to them. ) and I quote:

 "There are also bandits that will attack you on sight, and a clan of ogres
with a named ogre amongst them, who con amiable but are really only happy to
see you because they're bored and want to kill something new."
