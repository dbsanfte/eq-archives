Prior to the ZEM changes they made to pop, and the changes to xp for 
higher level mobs, I found the tier one pop zones to be the best xp for 
high levels I could find.  I did not have flags for tier 2 at the time.

I vaguely recall seeing what those ZEMs were, and they were higher than 
any other zone that I have seen a ZEM for.

For soloing, I can get better xp in some other zones, just due to speed 
of killing.  For grouping, tier 3 PoP zones are the best xp zones I have 
access to.  I realize that does not mean the ZEM is the best, there are 
other factors.
