It should be noted that they may require a certain margin in order to 
continue to recognize EQLive as a viable venture. If that is the case, 
it would certainly substantiate a rate increase under the circumstances, 
and their explanation, though still not entirely accurate, would be much 
closer to the truth that you claim.

Again, I'm not privy to any insider information, so I have no idea what 
their motivation may have been, but under the circumstances, I really 
can't see mounting a smear campaign with unsubstantiated claims.

I find it pretty rhetorical in either case.

Fair enough, I suppose.

Heh, I'm not convinced. :P
