First of all, like it has been said, its a journey, not a destination.
Leveling should not be the end-all be-all goal. Just because you are a high
level, then what? At the higher levels, you need to group. You can't do it
alone. Once you get there, what can you offer to a group? Just to be able to
hit hard or take the licks? For some that might be good enuff, but you have
to think about other things than that to be a real value add.
EQ is not just a story to read from cover to cover. It has many smaller
stories and branching paths you can go on. Take the time to take some of
those.
To answer your question though, 1 hour a nite isn't going to do it. You need
more time than that or get into a rocking group that really knows what they
are doing, but then there is the shared XP issue.

Ok, I'll get off my soapbox now. <scrape scrape>

279 minutes until I play again!
