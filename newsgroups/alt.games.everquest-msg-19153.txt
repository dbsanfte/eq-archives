Forget everything else...

Symbol of the Initiate Quest is easy.  Symbol can be used to summon a magic
warhammer (6/30) and adds 1 to wis and 3 to AC.  Also adds 3 mana (big
whoop).  I used it til I got a Vellium mace at 15 and the Spine Chill Spear
that was given to me.

All you need to do is carry a note from Qeynos to Freeport and then return.
