Well, there's Gnashmaul, an undead gnoll who dropped a
Vial of Rabid Froth, (quest unknown).

And though not teeth related:  Groi Gutblade, a troll
shadowknight who dropped a nice Ring of Shadows,
(Dex+2 and 3 charges of Gather Shadows).

Both rare spawns that I saw only once in 15 levels.
(Saw Gnawfang also, but never did see Cracktusk)
