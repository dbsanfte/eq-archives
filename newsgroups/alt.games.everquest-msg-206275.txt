Value Added Tax.  It's a tax that is added onto goods at every step where 
value is added to it.  All EU countries have it, many other countries 
around the world do as well.  Here in the US we have avoided that one, 
just have a sales tax in most states on the final sale of an item, not on 
each intermediate sale of it and it's component parts (so long as the 
seller added value to whatever he bought).
