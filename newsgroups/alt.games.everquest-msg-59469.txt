I would like to start hunting in Overthere, but am currently at the Estate
of Unrest in Faydwer.  What is the quickest way to get there, for instance
nearest teleport sight or translocate sight?  I'd rather not take my 35
ranger through timorous deep and spend the time, but whatever you think
would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you,
