I got the femurs after about 50 spiders, but I
haven't seen any patellas or thoraxes at all.

I now have 3 pieces of the armour, but I don't
think I'm going to bother with anymore.

I like the premise of the newbie quests, in the
way it encourages you to level, and receive some
usable reward. 

Unfortunately, it gives a dismal foretaste of how
dull and repetitive questing can be.

For the first time in my EQ life as semi-permanent
newbie, I also experienced the joys of
kill-stealing, (and not just from Deputy Asler).
