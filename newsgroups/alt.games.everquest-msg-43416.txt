And all you people on the PvP servers that complain about losing
money...well lets all call out the WAAAAAAAAmbulence for you all! Back in my
day, we used to be able to run around naked and root and choke melee types
to death and then steal some armor or other high value item...bank it and
then come back and do it again...and then once they were completely naked
yourself, we would charm you and make you attack the Sargent Slate and then
zone...and if you still kept logging on we would fear you off a cliff or
into some lava...

Now, its coin only, no charm or fear spells in Pking...meeeeeooow...what a
bunch of panseys...and people still complain about "He's camping my corpse,
he is gank squading me with his 12 guildmates"....well boohoo
