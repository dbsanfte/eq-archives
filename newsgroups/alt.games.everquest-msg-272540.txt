That's weak.

The cleric situation was a mistake that has unfortunately become 
prevalent in a vast amount of high end content in EQ1. What is suggested 
here would not be so intrinsic to game design. I see no reason to insist 
that it can't be utilized to a much lesser degree and add value and 
depth to the game.

Three plate classes. Two have spells and added utility to aid them 
greatly in reaching the highest level without the presence of the 
warrior class. Sorry, but I don't mind the warrior being thrown a bone 
on several high-end enounters under the circumstances. Frankly I find it 
kind of odd to even complain that warriors are required in EQ 
considering their widely and ill-conceived *lack* of desirability in all 
but the top 2%-4% of encounters.

It has it's problems, but I prefer that approach to the cookie-cutter 
with different colored icing design in EQ2.

Honestly, if we can get away from the status quo long enough to just 
play with some sense and tactics, aside from the cleric phenomenon, 
there really isn't that great a percentage of encounters where specific 
classes are absolutely required.

Additionally, I realize that the classes that *are* required in those 
particular encounters happen to number just a few. Well, there are only 
a few singular role classes in the game, and they happen to fill that 
role better than anyone else (not even very often, as the warrior will 
attest).

Again, aside from the heavy dependence upon the cleric class, the EQL 
system makes more sense than people are willing to accept.
