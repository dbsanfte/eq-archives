do you have the patterns?

Go to eqtraders.com and look up the recipes, you may be getting them 
confused (http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/surefall_druid.htm)
Recipe for Gloves: require two silk thread, ruined gnoll leather gloves, 
two giant field rat whiskers, and a large king snake skin and the glove 
pattern that the quest person gives you.  Purchased patterns won't work.

Good luck
