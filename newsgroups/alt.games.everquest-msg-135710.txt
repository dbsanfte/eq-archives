it seems that since the patch last night, my track window is horribly
broken:
any time anything on the track list despawns (dies, zones, spontaneously
despawns, etc), the window scrolls itself back to the top, and whatever
i had highlighted is no longer highlighted.

needless to say, as my track is around 175 and a LOT of screens long in
highly populated zones, it's damn near impossible to actually track
anything any more.  after trying to track to someone in the bazaar
earlier, i gave up after about 20 tries when people kept zoning the
between the time i would hit the vendor name and could get down to the
track button, so i just wandered around til i found 'em.

anybody else notice this?
