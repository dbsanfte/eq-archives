If I keep my wife happy with PC games, she gives me more time for EQ.  She 
liked the old Heroes of Might and Magic, loves Morrowwind, hates Prince of 
Persia.  She does not want an on-line game.  (she wants to play when she 
wants to play, but walk away at a moments notice)

Her PC is mid level (can run EQ 1, but slowly)

Can anyone suggest a new PC Game I can give her for Christmas?
