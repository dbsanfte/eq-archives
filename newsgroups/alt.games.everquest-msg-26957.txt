I've had people on more than one occasion train a mob on me that was
60% dead and wait for me to kill it.  Zone line is close, but they're
standing there waiting for me to finish it off so they can get the xp.

Then I mez, mem blur twice, and nuke it dead.  Even if I don't get the
xp, I'm spiteful enough to make sure they don't either because they
shouldn't force someone else to PL them.

And maybe they'll learn not to train enchanters. :-)


I guess druids and shaman could do the same thing with Charm Animal if
the PL beggars were training animals on you.  Charm spellls, I
believe, do a 100% reliable mem-blur on critters.
