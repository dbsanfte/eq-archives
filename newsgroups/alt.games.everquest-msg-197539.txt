To complete PoJ trials to be flagged for PoV/PoS you do not need to be in an
uber guild. Just need to complete a trial. Takes a lot of people a lot of
time. You didn't get flagged because your lazy/crap.

Unless you do it you don't get access to BoT or HoH.

To gain BoT you need 2 - 3 groups to kill named in PoS, to get HoH you need
60 people to take down a dragon.

To get Plane of Tactics, you need a 2 - 3 group raid to kill robot dragon in
PoI and then kill Behemoth in PoI factory.

Behemoth in PoI and Aerin'Dar in PoV are two of the hardest bastards there
is. A lot of time and effort goes into killing them unless you ZERG to the
max.

Lets move on to Crypt of Decay. To get there you need to take a raid to POD
and kill Grummus. Again a lot of time and effort, hard mob to defeat.

Same with plane of Torment, 18 man trial in PoN to get into PoNb to then
kill to get flagged.

Months of work to get away from all the fkin morons that flooded PoP 1st
tier and then 2nd tier.

Now after all that effort, I will now have to put up with /ooc LVL46 Ranger
LFG in Halls of Honor. Sheesh how fkin shitty is that. All that effort for
the reward of gaining more zones to play in free from all the fkin morons
who aren't in those zones simply because they are morons and now they open
them all up to all and sundry.

Fine gives more choice to play in. Hurrah!

Now we have to finish up with flags for elementals to again get away from
the shites rejected from a thousand Karnor trains but the reward better be
something fkin good for all the effort we have put into gaining flags and
back flags.
