You sure you've been playing the same game as the rest of us?

Of COURSE there will be guilds willing to accept known SEq users... in fact,
I'm prepared to bet real money, right now, that if SOE applied flags to
characters that are visible to everyone else... then you will find at least
half a dozen guilds ON EVERY SERVER that will restrict membership to ONLY
those people with 'cheat tags' on their names.

... and I'll even make a side bet that 50% of those chars are dr00dz ;o)
