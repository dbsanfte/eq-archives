Absolutely.

How gracious of them. I'd be grateful except that anything less would be 
a violation of their merchant contracts with the creditcard companies 
and banks which explicitly prohibit directly passing the transaction 
costs in the form of transaction surcharges.

I'm personally only mildly annoyed at the whole affair, and don't 
begrudge them their 2 bucks, and will take no action beyond /feedback. I 
do however fall solidly on the side of the fence that thinks SOE handled 
this badly; and am only debating the topic because Rumbledor 'couldn't 
understand' why anyone would be upset. *I* understand why people would 
be upset.
