Which is what fake enviromentalists really want. They want parks not nature.
Nature is the lion eats the cute young animal because it was the easiest to
catch. Eats it slowly while it is still alive. Real nature horrifies most
people , it is brutal and very unforgiving. We are the victims of our own
success, life is so good for us that we have completely forgotten the depths
from which we climbed. It is amusing that we strive so hard against the hard
won knowledge that let us climb in the first place.
