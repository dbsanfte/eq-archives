And why, as a melee would I even be starting my assist before the MA either
calls for me or the mobs attacks him?  I have to not be paying attention for
me to need to worry about breaking mez in the first place.  MA starts his
attack and calls for the assist, THEN I assist, with attack on.  Since he
called for the attack, his taunts etc. will have already been accomplished.
