Ok - started a bard on test and did a /testbuff

First off - looks like all the important skills
are maxed for level (including SH)

2nd - you get 25 songs - but they aren't all
the songs to 25 - you have magical monologue
(2nd level 9 song), Song of Sustenance (2nd 15th)
and Mana chant song (2nd 20th) in place of the
23,24,25 songs.

3rd - the gear.  The visible pieces look like
lambent, and seem to have similar stats.

BP - AC 20, Sta +5, Cha +1, HP +25
Arms - AC 11, Cha +1, +2 all saves
Bracer (2) - AC 9, Str +4, Cha +1
Gloves - AC 12, Dex +5, Cha +1
Legs - AC 13, Cha +1, Agi +5
Boots - AC 21
Helm - AC 13, Cha +3, Int +5

Ears and Neck look identical to 
orc-fang
Ears (2) - AC 3, Str +3, HP + 15
Neck - AC 5, Str, Sta, Agi all +3

Face - AC 4, Cha +3, SVM +7
Cloak - AC 8, Dex +5
Shoulders - AC3, Str +, Svm +10
Belt - Ac 3, Str +2, Sta +2
Range - Ac 8, Dex +4, Sta +3, HP +25

The weapon looks like a Centi SS
11/23 short sword.

He was only given a drum, no
lute/horn or flute.

You can re-execute /testbuff to
get a second sword.

Also - the songs are in some odd
order in the book - don't reorganize
them until after the 2nd /testbuff
command though - it'll make 'em
nasty again.

Just checked - visible armor is
identical to lambent except for the
boots - which must be an error, as
lambent boots are only AC11 and AC
21 boots seems a little high for a
25.

Wonder what classes without Sol Ro
armor get?  hmmmm - time to make a 
BL and find out :)
