I believe that it is working as intended. Not that I'm completely
happy with the intention, mind you. :)

(Although it must be said that the moon is significantly further away
than anywhere else on Norrath, which might justify this type of
restriction. However it completely fails to account for the fact that
a simple Level 4 Gate can get you from the moon to Norrath, and vice
versa. It seems to me that Norrath<==>Luclin gating/porting should be
an all-or-nothing affair in the interest of consistency.)

Having the Nexus Gate and Portal spells is still somewhat useful; you
can get to a bank on the moon fairly quickly, or you even have a
Luclinar (lunar?) evacuation option that doesn't require an
up-to-15-minute wait to get back to what you were doing. Not entirely
useless; just a bit irritating. :)
