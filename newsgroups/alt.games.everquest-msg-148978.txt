Well, the "eaiser" kiting begins when you get the first charm song.  However,
you can successfully kite using CoD and DDD.  Twist Selo's, CoD, and DDD.
Or pay a friendly druid or shaman 5g to 1pp for a SoW. and twist  CoD, DDD, and
Bellow.  SoW makes it MUCH easier and safer, because it won't drop if you get
stunned.

(You can actually twist 4 songs, but I'd recommend 2 or 3 till you get the hang
of kiting).

The trick is to run the mobs in ovals or figure 8's and start your DDD or CoD
song just before begin your turn.  The mobs will run somewhat to the inside
of your turn.  You need to work on making your turns gradual enough that they
don't catch up with you, yet tight enough that DDD/CoD hits.

You should probably equip your horn, since DDD does a lot more damage
with it.  Alternatively your lute for CoD.  If you really get fancy, you can twist
those two instruments too!  Using the third person perspective (hit F9 four
times) and having an open flat area to kite will help a lot.  At your level, I'd
suggest North Karana (watch out for griffons!).

With some practice, you can "turn and burn" up to four mobs at a time.
As a lesson plan:

1) Practice running large figure 8's and ovals from the 3rd person perspective.

2) Try kiting one green-to-you mob, and one damage song, with SoW.

3) Add another damage song.  Twist each on alternate turn.  Foe example,
DDD on the turn on the left, and CoD on the turn on the right.

4) Add bellow in the stretch between the two turns.

5) Add another mob or two.  Maybe higher level... blues.

5) Remove bellow, and use Selo's instead of SoW.

6) Add bellow back.  Burn in the turns, and Selo's / Bellow in the straight aways.
You'll need longer straight-aways for this.


7) Try switching instruments... Keep the one instrument on your cursor, and the other
   in the secondard slot.  left click the instrument into the slot to switch up.

When you're targeted mob wanders off (because of the bellows on him), run in circle
trailing the other mobs, just twisting Selo's and bellow to kill him off, then target one
of the mobs in your pack with f8, then repeat the regular twist till he wanders off..etc.


Now you're cooking with gas :)
