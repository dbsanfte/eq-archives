We wiped to Gozzrem at 0 percent once. Wheee.

Pet peeve last night: rangers, rogues, bards etc. running to get a
patch heal from me during a LtK turning bad due to adds, member of
said adds (cute lil green drake) falling in love with the healer, me
channeling heal through tanking cute lil green drake twice while
recipient of heal just stood there and let me tank it. No wonder I
dropped the third time the drake took special interest in me.

But, Cloak of the Sky. /flipoff Ben Haddick :p
