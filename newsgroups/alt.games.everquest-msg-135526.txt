Well you know when it involved concentration camps I sort of though those

Obviously, if you cannot tell the difference between Derry and Afghansitan -

Ok you putrid littlepuke you always say that the US has no friends let me gi
ve you some descriptions of yourself. From a friend of mine that is from
Ireland and now an American Citizen. He describes British as those "
Murdering beasts" and from a Indian from an India now an American citizen
too, who describes you as " Butchers." So much for your compassion. You were
better at Empire building.
Come back when you get some clues. Bye Bye.
