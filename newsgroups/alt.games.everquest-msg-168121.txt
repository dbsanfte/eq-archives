LOL!

The effect of that is so miniscule it's not funny. The only times the
actual "running OOM" is going to become a dominant factor are on fights
against mobs so huge that it takes a raid some rediculous time to grind
it down (and in that case, there's not much you can do post-rod-nerf
except use your most efficient casts to maximize output) and groups that
are pulling so fast that the casters would never get to med anyway
unless they skip some mobs. (Which will happen eventually anyway.

Even with KEI you still have be judicious in your use of mana, you just
don't spend as long pointlessly sitting on your ass inbetween, as has
already been pointed out.

I think you're just in the midst of one of your "You damned kids have it
too easy because I had to walk uphill to school both ways barefoot in
the snow and kill a grizzly bear with my looseleaf notebook" phases.
I've been a caster both pre-and post KEI, and I see it only as a plus
for new and old alike.
