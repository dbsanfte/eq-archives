Details of filming already provided by others, but I have to ask... why
the reaction? I'll admit it wasn't the greatest thing ever put down on
film, but it was a fun movie with good effects. I'd go see all three
parts. And as far as being commercially viable for them, I believe they
are already in the black after the release of part one, covering the
cost of making *all three* movies. So it's going to be somebody's cash
cow.
