There are several modes of transportation.

One, shoe leather.  Run from zone to zone till you get where you are
going.  This will not get you from Felwithe to Halas, since they are on
different continents.

Two, boats.  This won't get you where you are going, but it will get you
from one continent to another, so you can use shoe leather the rest of the
way.  There is a dock in Butcherblock (the right hand one, not the left)
where every 15 minutes or so a boat appears.  Get on the boat and it will
eventually move, and zone in to OOT, spend about 15 mintues crossing that
zone, then zone into East Freeport.  From there you can run to Halas.  OR
you could take the shuttle to Timorous Deep and swim across that zone to
the ogre island where you could take a raft to Oasis.

Three, Druid ports.  High enough level druids get spells which allow them
to take people they are grouped with from one zone to another.  You could
get a port from whereever you are to Surefall Glade, and then run to Halas
from there.

Four, Wizard ports.  Same deal, but different possible destinations.  I
think the closest a wizard can get you is in West Karana.

Five, if you have the Shadows of Luclin expansion, you can take the
"spires" for transportation.  This involves going to one of the various
spots in the world with working spires, hailing the scion within and
getting a special stone (say "journey to luclin").  Then you wait, and in
at most 15 minutes, the spire activates and takes you to the Nexus on the
moon.  From there, you can go to special miniature spires that will take
you back down to one of the five working spires back on Norrath.  In your
case, North Karana is the closest to Halas, although at low levels it might
be safer to go to Toxxulia Forest and take the boat from Erudin to Qeynos
and run from there.

Six, if you have the Planes of Power expansion, you have access to by far
the easiest transportation system.  Outside all racial starting cities, and
a few other places in the world, there are special books on pedastles.
Click on one of these and you show up in Plane of Knowledge.  Ringing that
zone are stones with names of cities on them, click on one of those stones
and you get transported back down near that city, usually in a newbie zone
right outside, but in a "safe" spot without too much danger of getting
attacked.

Short way, then, Felwithe to Greater Faydark to Plane of Knowledge to
Everfrost to Halas.

Long way: Felwithe to GFay to BB to OOT to EFP to WFP to EC to WC to Kith
to HHP to EK to NK to WK to QH to BB to Everfrost to Halas
