If you are under 20, there's no mana to worry about, you run heal and relax.

Once you get a pulse mana song, then your choices get tricky:

Healsong and leave it
Manasong and leave it.
Pulse mana song (4/3rds the mana that just leaving it on generates)

Or twist:
Heal
Mana
Mana
Mana
repeat
Which gives you 100% of the healing that leaving heal running would plus 100%
the mana that leaving manasong running would.  It does cost you 1/4th the mana
that pure pulsing mana would give you.

Once you get amplification, choices get more involved; Amp increases mana per
pulse, but you have to twist it in... weird thing is it has a duration of
approximately 9 tics.

Amp
Mana 8 times
repeat
now becomes your max mana output.

Heal
Amp
Mana
Mana
Heal
Mana
Mana
Mana
Heal
Mana
Mana
Mana
repeat
now gives you 100% the heal of "leave it run" but 150% the mana of "leave mana
run"


For the higher levels, (34 plus) the choices work like this:

Run Cantata and leave it on.  (this is heal and mana)

Run Cantata and pulse mana between
Cantata
Mana
Mana
Mana
repeat

Keep Amplification and Cantata up constantly and pulse mana
Twist:
Cantata
Amp
Mana
Cantata
Mana
Mana
Mana
Cantata
Mana
Mana
Amp
Cantata

Keeping Cantata up continuously still allows room to run pulse mana song 3
times in between, Amp runs 9 pulses long so you can keep that up at only
partial pulse cost, and amp gives you more mana per pulse.

Personally, unless mana is at a premium (we just rezzed, or we just had an over
the top difficult fight) I'm of the "turn it on and step away from the
keyboard" attitude.  Sure, I could give you almost twice as much mana flow as
with just Cantata... but that means zero down time for me, as I"m certainly
clicking out a 4 twist whenever there is a mob in camp.

If it were possible to automate this twist, I'd certainly use it during all
downtime.

I still wouldn't automate combat twisting, because situations in combat tend to
be very fluid, and I often end up using as many as 7 of my songs in quite a
wide variety of combinations and variations.  On the other hand, I'm sure you'd
see bot bards singing a generically effective twist or two and ignored, in fact
you could just leave them singing the heal/mana twist and get decent effect for
hours on end.
