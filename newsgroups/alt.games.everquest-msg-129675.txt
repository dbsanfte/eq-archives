I have an EQ guide that I bought a few days after I bought the game almost a
year ago.  It is the Prima guide and is circa Kunark release.  Under necro
research it list different runes.  Study, journey, apprentice, etc.  I can't
find anything at all on caster's realm.  The main necro website seems to
have been better once upon a time and is now just a board.  Even when it had
much more info on it, there was reference to these runes but never
elaborated on the subject.
What are these for?  My first character was a necro and I trashed it when I
realized I put a lot of time into a poorly built (hell, it was my first)
character.  I have since built another necro and am happy with it and up to
lvl 18 now.  Now that I have to research and stuff again, I'm curious as to
what these things are for.  The book is dated, as I found glaring
differences in the text within only a couple weeks of playing, but then with
this game any guide is seemingly outdated as the game is perpetual W.I.P.
Thanks in advance to any kind soul who can enlighten me.

Sean...
