Hmm, so for lame-assed level-mad morons like you level 40 is a joke. 
For those of us who play the game strictly for entertainment YOU are a
joke.

And what is it that makes you think that ANY level is impressive?  ebay
and power-leveling between them do a pretty thorough job of making level
meaningless as an accomplishment.
For that matter, the more I learn about the high-level game the more
uninterested I am in being part of it.  My highest character to date is
L45 (slightly less than two years after creation), and it is becoming
more and more rare that I find anything interesting to do with him that
involves exp or loot (the occassional opportunity to RP with old in-game
friends is of course still fun, but they don't play too much anymore I
don't often encounter somebody interested in freeform RP in EQ).  On
Tunare at least Vox and Naggy raids appear to have become soulless
bureaucratic exercises with months long loot queues that shame the
pre-Kunark LGuk experience.
Leveling is uninteresting, loot camping is excruciatingly boring,
"uber"-guilds are typically pathetic collections of little hitlers and
their wannabe followers, as far as I can tell the fun part of the game
is levels 10 to 40.
Heh, just re-read that, sounds bitter, but it's not.  I have a great
deal of fun playing EQ, just gotta steer clear of the little hitlers and
their loot queues and make a new character now and then to take up the
slack as I lose interest in the older ones.  Too bad nobody seems to
have come up with a decent PvP system, every atempt to address the
griefer problem I've read about seems only to provide the small-souled
punks new opportunities to exploit the system.
