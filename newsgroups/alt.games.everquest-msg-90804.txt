They're an unecessary PitA, and a disincentive to exploring.

It's not just this example.  I'm playing at night, and it's near time for me
to crash.  PullerTank says "Ok, just one more pull." Followed by "Inc, the
entire castle."  Loading, Please Wait.

Now, I'm on line two more hours trying to get my corpse back.  So much for
sleep.  Or, even worse, half the time I play before work (just one of the
side effects to rotating shift work).  Now, I've got to leave in the middle
of a corpse run to go to work.  Yeah, I guess I shouldn't play EQ if my work
schedule will interfere with Verant's <strike>myopia</strike> Vision.

This is a game, not a job.  "Suck it up" isn't always the right answer for
the company to give.

No, they're not a "fact of life," they're a decision made by Verant.
Ragnarok Online doesn't have CR's, so they may not be neccessary.  It's like
when a chief says "that's the way it's always been."  My immediate response
is "that doesn't stop us from being able to fix it now."  Not the most
popular idea, but it's better to light a candle than curse the darkness.

You may not have a problem.  Many of us aren't too fond of this aspect.  No,
I'm not saying I'll leave the game over it, but if verant ever un-breaks
that aspect, the first round of Tumpy Tonics is on me.

And not to explore.  Which really irritates me.  I like exploring.  I still
do it, but at my own risk.  It sucks dying three more times when you're
trying to get your corpse back from Lesser Faydark, just because I decided
"I wonder where this goes..."  F'sking brownies.  Double F'sking
Equestriall.  At least the Pained Unicorn didn't hate me.

And that takes half the fun out of the game.  Of course, I've earned my
guild tag, Tempters of Fate, several times over.  I'm sorry, but nice, safe
XP grinds aren't fun.  "Let's see what I haven't seen before" is.  CR's
nerfed that fun.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
