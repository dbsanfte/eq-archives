Seeing all this talk: EQ was running on voodoo2 & RIva 128 etc cards
way bac in time. The 3D graphics in EQ is just lame compared to
current graphics (Unreal2 etc), so *any* current 3D card should
run any EQ (Kurnak with better 3D models etc) without any issue,
even at best resolutions and clip plane set to max. The only issues
are some weird driver or game bugs. I have a GeForce DDR (old model) and
I have polygon errors with far away objects (for instance the Tower of
Kurns blinks madly when approaching it, and is fine when I'm there).
This with newest Nvidia drivers. I'm not yet sure how to solve it,
maybe some setting. Other than that don't worry. The voodoo 5500 isn't
up to par with the newest cards like GeForce2 GTS or GeForce3, but
it's far from unusable.
