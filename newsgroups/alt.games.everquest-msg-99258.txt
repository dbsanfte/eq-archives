Infact :
From Caster's realm :

                         Thursday March 21, 2002
                      FOCUS ITEM NERFAGE

Seems that as part of this morning's patch changes were also made to
focus
items. Unfortunately since this was not mentioned in the patch message
the
changes are still filtering in from the servers.

Currently it appears that the casting time reduction items only work on
spells
which are between 4 and 9.5 seconds. Spells which have a casting time
longer
than 9.5 or shorter than 4.0 will no longer be affected by the focus
items.

It also appears that the damage increasing focus item no longer works on
some
high end spells.

Please keep info coming in as you find out any other stealth changes
which may
have happened to these items.
