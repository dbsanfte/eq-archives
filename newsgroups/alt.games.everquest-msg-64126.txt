I know this is a stupid question, but-

There was not enough space on my normal EQ drive (drive D), so I
installed the Luclin files to a folder on another drive (Drive E).
Will this cause any problems with the game/patcher/whatever?

Due to space constraints I cannot get all the files to fit in a single
drive even if EQ was the only thing on the drive. In case it matters,
the OS is Windows ME.
