I got the Gnoll language quest, which involves finding some kind of
rune.  Unfortunately there are now, I think, no gnolls that will drop
the items I need (they come in chests, not like other quest drops,
from what I understand) that aren't grey, so I guess I'll never
actually learn gnollish, unless I buy them.  I thought things needed
for quests wouldn't be affected by the trivial loot code, but
apparently that was too much to hope for.  Maybe they'll change it.
