I favour a dynamic xp bonus. Poll zones every 5 minutes, the lower the 
average population a zone has the better the xp bonus, updated every 
hour or so. Ideally use a modestly intelligent alogorthm that can handle 
  (ie ignore) brief surges as a result of raid prep in places like 
oasis, feerott, etc... and put in some special handlers to ignore the 
over 50 population in newbie wayfarer camp zones...

My solution is objective, people don't need to vote or agree. If the 
zone is devoid of life for 3 hours straight the xp bonus will be very 
good. If there are 40 people in it, and its been like that for 3 hours 
there will be very little xp bonus.

I'd still advocate revamping various zones to make the loot/quests/etc 
better though. XP isn't *everything*.
