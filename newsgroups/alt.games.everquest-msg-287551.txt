Magna Charta, the European time raiding guild on Bristlebane Server is
now recruiting!

We are a multicultural European guild whose main languages are English
and German. We raid Sundays ï¿½ Thursdays every week, from 3pm CET on
Sundays and from 6:30pm CET during the week. Our current targets
include high-end TSS targets, Solteris and SoF raid targets. 

If you are level 75+ with 800 or more AAs, and you can offer 40% raid
attendance or higher, we want to hear from you! Hop on over to our
website http://eq.tremere.at/index.php  or contact a member of the
Invite Team (Jasmeene, Semolini, Teechammusco, Vesula and Yinla) in
game for a chat.

(Please note that if you do not quite meet our requirements, it is
worth making sure you have an up to date magelo and contacting a
member of the Invite Team to see what we can work out!)

[Any questions here feel free to post follow-ups or mail me.]
