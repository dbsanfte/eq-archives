Uh, the *whole* idea behind running (either to the guards or to
the zone) is so that you do NOT have to do CRs.   The people
who are going to have the best HP/AC to deal with getting beat-up
on the way are the tanks, not the casters, so -- like always -- that's
who you want the mobs beating on.

If you're waiting until you've already lost to start to run, you're
waiting too long.  The whole point is to have someone make that
decision at the earliest point at which it's apparent:  and that's
usually when the cleric/healer decides "I can't keep up with the
damage, so we better go NOW" or when the enchanter/bard dies.

People/groups who decide to run only when the tank's at 10%
health and the healer's OOM are going to die anyway.  The "secret"
is to know when you have to run when the healer still has 60m and
the tank's at 90% health...
