No weapon has a delay so high that it will miss procs just from not
being swung. Well, maybe the one with delay 150, but not likely
anything else. I use a sword from the Emp in ssra on my warrior, and
that thing has a pretty beefy delay... but not so beefy I'm proccing
on every swing or anything, and that lifetap is a pretty high rate
proc.

>swings 4 times per minute, no?

No, unless the proc rate is high enough that you expect more than four
in a minute... which is possible, but then weapons that only swing 4
in a minute... well can you think of any? Even the delay 150 one will
potentially swing 8 counting the double attacks.

Anyways, one of the strategies out there involves warriors using
earthshaker and rampage. Apparently (I've never seen it done myself)
warriors intentionally slow themselves to gain a higher chance of
proccing on the rampage.


>i say that with the [about to be disproven]
>idea in mind that a requirement for a proc is a swing, and the more swings*
>a weapon has, the more likely a proc is

Nope. Well not unless as we mentioned you have a delay so horrific you
are actually swinging less than you average procs per minute.

According to the parses, you would proc every swing in such a
situation (unless there's a high level cutoff chance of proccing).

Yes you predicted it; you don't have to hit the enemy to proc.
