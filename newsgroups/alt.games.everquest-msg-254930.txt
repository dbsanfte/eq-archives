Dosent matter. They dont have any right to risk my xp.

At least one of the poison gas traps kills the whole party in
like 4 seconds if set off; and then there is the matter of curses
that never go away and have to be cured. Since no one in the
party can usually remove them, you have to go pay someone to do
it.

If you are THAT determined to look in the chest, you can wait 3
mins while I and others who dont want the risk exit the dungeon.
AFAIAC anything you get is yours, be it death, or a stupid drop.
