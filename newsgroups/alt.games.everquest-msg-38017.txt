In this vein: If you uber-twink a new char (starting at level 1) would it
get the skill increases it would need later on?  For example, let's say I
create a warrior and start it with plate armor and outrageous weapons (I
really don't yet know what's uber, maybe even armor better than plate), what
would happen to their offense, defense, and weapon skills?  Never get
touched and one whack it's dead. Or does it matter?

Thanks,

Lewis
