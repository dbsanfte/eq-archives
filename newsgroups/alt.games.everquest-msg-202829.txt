There's a big long thread about it on the Vazaelle server boards.  For your
convenience:

Pretty interesting to see everyone's take on it, and I have to agree with
one of the posters that EQ players are probably the most untrusting folks in
the world :-)  I believe he solo'd in the sense that no one else was hitting
or tanking the mob.  I think it's possible he had outside healing, and he
certainly had a mega-DS.  He posted somewhere that his monk's dps is around
45, but with a big DS that could go up to 75 easily enough.  He also used
Stinging Wort potions (300hp heal).  So I guess it really depends on the
definition of soloing.  He didn't make the potions or cast the buffs on
himself, but if he was the only one hitting the mob, I would say he solo'd
it.
