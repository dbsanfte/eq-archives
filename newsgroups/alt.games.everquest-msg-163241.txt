Nor did I claim that you were accusing him of defending thievery.
I will say again, however, that you encouraged readers of your post
infer that he was doing so.  And, given your posting history, I can
only assume that it was done deliberately.  You have shown yourself
to be one of the most accomplished wordsmiths who posts here, I just
cannot believe that you didn't know exactly what you were doing when
you made that post.

> Hell he didn't even mention thievery. 


No he didn't, you did.  Which is very much to the point.

And all I know about you I've learned from your posts here.  Your
claims of innocence in this regard don't square with what I've
come to expect from you, sorry.  This isn't a criminal court, no
amount of slippery "logic" is gonna create a "reasonable doubt".
