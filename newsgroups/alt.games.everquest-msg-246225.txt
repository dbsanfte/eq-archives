Both those paths suffer from the same flaw.  You arrive at level 50 having 
experienced 2% of what the game has to offer, and thinking you know how to 
play.

In the first path, you end up with druids and shamans asking, "What do you 
mean I can't sow here?  Indoors?  What's that?"  And you have people who 
have no idea how to do a dungeon crawl, at all.

In the LDoN path, you have people who have never been swamped by respawn 
before.  You have people with no clue how to sneak to a particular camp 
deep in a dungeon.  Invis?  IvU?  Why bother?  We're not going to actually 
pass any mobs you don't end up fighting.  You have people who've never 
been attacked by a mob that was hiding behind a hidden wall.  There's a 
certain sameness to all the LDoN dungeons.  LDoN-raised players might be 
suprised to fight in, perhaps, Velk's on the platforms, or by the pits in 
LGuk, since they're both completely outside their realm of experience.  
They've never been trained.  They've never been KSed.  They've never had 
to race other humans to a spawn, only a timer.  They've never had to deal 
with mobs of widely varying levels being in the same area.  They've 
probably never fought anything perma-rooted.  They've never had to risk 
more than a 5-6 pull of medium-blue mobs.  They've never had to camp a key 
to open a door.  They've never camped in one spot and had the puller go 
out and grab something, or waited for the next spawn, for more than 5-10 
minutes.  They've never worried about faction hits.  They've probably 
never had mobs -not- be social.

And, to make matters worse on both paths, they've been playing a month and 
gotten to level 50.  They think they're so much smarter than us, who spent 
a year or more getting to 50...  and then proceed to lecture us on how 
things -should- be done, based on their vast and entirely uber experience, 
and be completely wrong and get us wiped, because they didn't know one of 
those things above.  And they're all impatient, 24/7 must be killing 
something now!  They can't be persuaded to come help you camp that one mob 
you need for a quest, since waiting for the next spawn every 15 minutes or 
so makes the exp suck eggs.  And of course, -nothing- could matter more 
than exp.

On balance, I'd say the LDoN path is marginally preferable to the outdoor 
zone path.  But give me a player who's actually fought in many different 
zones of many different types over either, any day of the week.
