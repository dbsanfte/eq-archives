If God is timeless, he *did* (from his perspective) bring us into
existance already educated.  Our limited senses make us perceive
this thing called time, but it could be just an illusion.

One pet theory I have is that God created the universe is such a way
that it could exist without him, and then caused himself to cease to
exist (committed suicide).  This leaves us with a Godless universe
that was, in fact, created by God.

This comment isn't really related to the subject we're discussing,
but for some reason, your comment made me think of it.  I just threw
it out there in case anyone wanted to comment on it.  It seems like
one possible reality.

In any case, I think most of this thread boils down to our imperfect
definitions for omnipotent and omniscience, and the very real
possibility that, being the limited creatures we are, we're just plain
unable to conceive of them fully.

I am tempted to redefine omnipotence (in my own mind) as "the ability
to do anything that is doable" (i.e., you can't do undoable things).
And omniscience would be "the ability to know anything that is knowable"
(i.e., you can't know unknowable things).

Some might argue that this dilutes the power of God.  That may be true
and personally I'm not 100% sure what I believe.
