You'll have to pardon me if I refuse to think of someones personal website 
as The Gospel.

You'll also have to forgive me for thinking that your obsession with the 
economic aspect of EQ is asinine. The parallel between EQ economics and RL 
economics is small. Who cares if my sword depreciates a few plat in value? 
I did not buy the fucking thing to turn a tidy profit(which, BTW, EQ  has 
been carefully balanced to limit). I bought it to lop off some goddamn 
monster heads.

Having played D2, where items do suffer wear and tear, I can tell you it is 
lame. Very lame. 

If, however, there is room for your insanity in the Vision, I think you may 
find mob-hunting licenses to be a good idea.
