Well, not necessarily the rate increased, but -who- can drop it
increased.

I was in a faction and exp group last night, we went in
a couple safe spots from the WL area and started pulling
from near the bank.  To my astonishment, corroded plate
greaves dropped.  To my delight, I won the rolloff... but
the fact that a six man band was easily capable of holding
an area where the stuff dropped was far more exciting than
actually getting my armor.

I"m used to seeing roughly three drops in a long night's
raid in the arena, with the loot getting split up amoung
30 people.  If I can go in with six, or heck, four (make
sure to bring a plate, chain, leather, and cloth) and still
see drops, then the odds go up to where it becomes a
worthwhile endeavor!

I'm also used to seeing whole raid wipeouts in the arena,
where CR means a necro and a few Kpp in coffins more
often than not.  We got in over our heads, lost the tank,
evaced out... then ported back to WL and walked in,
resed, and were back fighting in under 5 minutes.

Vastly preferable to the massive undertaking that a raid
can be.

What was Verant thinking, cleric only armor
that a cleric would actually wear?  Haven't
seen anything like that since the bracers
of the reverant!
