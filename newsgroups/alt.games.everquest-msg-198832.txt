Try soloing Greyhoppers in Marus Seru.  They are social, so grab one, and 
pull it to a safeish spot.  At levels 28 and 29, I had little trouble with 
them unless I got 3 or more.  Soloing them with a very mildly twinked 
warrior (crafted armor, skull shaped barbute), I could easily handle up to 
two starting at 50% health.  Bandage back up to 50%, and go get another one 
or two.  I have no haste items at all.  Also, make sure you are wielding 
two 1HS weapons, not just one.  They are easy dark blue mobs to solo at 
your level.  You'll get xp and skillups, and, as an added bonus, rockhopper 
and greyhopper hides for tradeskilling.
