I agree that the original statement is ridiculous for entirely different 
reasons.  It suggests, first off, that the addictiveness of something can 
be quantified, which is silly.  How addictive something is depends very 
much on the individual person involved.  Example:  in general, cigarettes 
are very addictive.  But there are people who can smoke once in a while at 
parties, and never have much of a problem.

Secondly, it asserts that whatever this bogus quantity of addiction 
potential is, that value is less or equal for all other 
hobbies/sports/pastimes than it is for EQ.  I feel comfortably certain 
that there is at least one hobby, sport, or pastime that EQ is 'more 
addictive' than.
