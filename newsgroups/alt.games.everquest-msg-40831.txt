Actually, some of your points are valid, one is not...Now this is just
speaking from a purely military standpoint:

When you start worrying about the civilian casualties you start waisting
valuable time and possibly many more military lives.  For those of us in the
military, defending OUR civilians rights, why are their civilians worth more
than ours?

 I could give a flying FUCK about them and their families.  I worry about my
wife and kids and those of the country a swore to protect over 14 years ago.
Im not fighting for Allah, or some religious intangible.  I am fighting for
the PEOPLE of my country.  Many I know and love, many more whom I do not.
Those that I dont are mine to protect, because I swore to do so because
someone loves them just as I love mine.  I didnt swear to protect the
civilians in other countries.  That is for their militaries.  Their
militaries, whether official or not, have decided to bring the war to MY
soil...so i will happily take it to thiers...and YES...make nice glass
parking lots out of all that sand.
