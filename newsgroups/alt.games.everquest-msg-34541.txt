Spiders are good. Hunted them myself go get silk for my own tailoring. Still the
best source for silk in the game (and the next one that say EK (which people
complain over at Eqtraders that they drop a LOT less silk, and the problem that
usually several high level people nuke spiders in all directions and blame each
other for KSing, leaving nothting to low level people) get their butt nuked)
I hunted there at level 22-23 myself alone, and died down there 3 times. If you
wanna hunt them you NEED to snare ALL spiders. If you dont they run and in the
worst case if you are in the Giant spider room and the first of the 3 pop run,
youll have 11 spiders on you.
And DO have cure poison memmed, youll need it. Resist to poison is a GOOD idea too.

And if you get in ANY doubt if you can kill then, RUN. If you dont youll get
poisoned and die (ok, not every time, but you get the general idea)

And last thing, dont get greedy. 2 of my deaths was because i wanted the giant
spider and followed it.


But i would rather reccomend the Hermit in SK

Easy kill, can get up to level 28 from him, and he drop FS weapons and plat. Got
from 24-28 in a few days on him only, and earned 300pp while doing so.
