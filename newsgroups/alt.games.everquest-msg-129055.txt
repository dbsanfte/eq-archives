The state of Israel was born out of terrorism in the first place.

Problem is that it only tends to be called "relatiation" when it's
Israel attacking Palestinians. 

When it comes to shooting civilians there are examples of both
sides. When it comes to using tanks and planes it must be 
Israel, since only they have those.

Don't recall any cases of Israeli ambulances being fired on by
Palestinians or Israeli doctors and paramedics being kept from
the wounded by deadly force though.

Shooting ambulances and medical personnel might not be 
"terrorism", but it certainly is a war crime.

But only in Palestine, someone does it in New York and Washington
and it's "terrorism".
