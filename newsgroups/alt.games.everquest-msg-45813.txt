Your rational on why the stick around code was put in is exactly why it was
put there...  For PvP servers.  On the 'blue' servers, it wasn't needed.  15
to 30 seconds with no packet traffic dumped you from the game entirely.

As for solo vs group, true, solo gets you loot, higher risk, less up time,
etc...  I have 'sat there' meditating through getting killed while LD due to
a heal of a group member.  I went LD and was killed sitting... group said I
never even stood up.  Just sat there taking full non-modified damage...
Hell, you can't sit through getting beat on if on-line...  First hit, you
auto-stand...

How about a puller who goes LD?  Runs into the building, hits the mob and
goes LD...  Happened to me and I've seen it happen to others too...

There is no special mass re-write needed to 'fix' the problem.  They just
put the old LD code back on 'blue' servers and leave it the way it is on PvP
servers.  This way, those who wish to kill one another don't end up losing
the kill due to a guy pulling the plug and those of us who enjoy the other
aspects of the game don't have to pay the penalty for the PvP cheat
protections...  15 to 30 seconds to disconnect is still quite a long time if
in a fight...
