Did a bit of fighting with this trio yesterday, and it didnt' go
as well as I'd thought it would on paper.

Here was my plan: shaman buffs the living hell out of the rogue,
and also HP buffs herself.  Shaman and rogue both go look for
mobs while I sit and meditate about how wonderful the exp is with
the best healing and  damage production in the game.  Either one
finds a mob both return to me.  Rogue and shaman position
themselves on opposite ends of the mob and I put pet on the
shaman end, then DS the rogue.  Every time the rogue's BS pops
up, she evades and stabs the mob in the back while it briefly
beats on the shaman, then presumably turns back to trying to kill
the rogue.  Shaman and her pet and mine all work on the back of
the mob most of the time, and she keeps the rogue healed.  As
mana permits, I drop bombs in on the mob to speed things up.  If
a lot of mana gets used, during downtime rogue does bind wounds
on shaman while she cannidances keeping under 50% HP till things
are rosy again.  Shaman is also available to root park adds, or I
can put my pet on them if it comes to that.

But the rogue wasn't evading, so the shaman was just standing
there doing her pathetic melee output for no real reason, and
missing out on some potential "on her butt getting HP and mana"
time.  Talked the rogue into using evade, and the next mob made a
beeline for -me- instead of the shaman... when I wasn't nuking
any heavier than when just me and the shaman duo!

We weren't together all that long, so we didn't have a real
chance to iron out the bugs, I still think this group has a lot
of potential, even though rogues aren't the best MT you can come
up with... in fact if the shaman wasn't 6 levels lower than the
me and the rogue, I'd have reversed things: rogue stays behind
the mob, and when BS comes up and she uses it and grabs aggro,
she evades and ditches it back to shaman ASAP, leaving shaman MT
for most of the fight, instead of just for the duration of BS
attempts. 

Downside on -my- end is that with any PC melee my pet isn't
capable of getting mob aggro, so I lose the free and larger
FireElementalAura DS, I have to cast my smaller Barrier of
Combustion instead, using mana and sacrificing effect.  Plus, I
can't be backup healer, which is very handy with my pet as MT in
our duo.  Instead I've been using the air pet, but I'm afraid
that will interfere with the rogue's ability to get a back to
stab on demand.  Probably I need to research or bazaar buy my 39
water pet (definately -not- the earth pet) so the pet is doing
nuking instead of stunning.

Is there any way my pet could be the target during backstabs?  I
think that even with evade the mob will stay on the rogue... or
is that wrong, and it will turn to my pet politely long enough to
get stabbed?
