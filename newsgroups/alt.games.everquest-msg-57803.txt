Heh.... try taking your visiting British friends to the local pub when a
lot of your friends and co-workers are in there, (including several
females) and have one of them loudly announce that they plan on getting
"completely cunted" that evening.

Or trying to hit on an American girl asking for her address and
inquiring as to whether or not he could "knock her up" later that week?
