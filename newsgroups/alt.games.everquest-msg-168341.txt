Er thanks...  but I don't have any problems at all with execution trial
anyway.

Whilst it will probably never be "trivial" (you can still fail easily if you
pick your ass when killing the waves).. I don't think its anywhere near
difficult, and it most certainly isn't "impossible".

It doesn't need a chanter, it doesn't need a shaman, it doesn't even need a
warrior (I've tanked it all, despite the first wave named dispelling the
crap out of me).. a shaman is just my usual method in killing it though.
