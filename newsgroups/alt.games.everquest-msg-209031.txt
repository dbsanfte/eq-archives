Can't say.  The problem is that you can't easily get to or leave the zone.
Getting to PoM requires running through NToV, where the mobs will kill even
a level 65 character very quickly.  It's *extremely* risky unless you're
part of a raid that's clearing NToV.  And if you die, there's no graveyard
to collect your corpse at.  Ugh.

And while the exit from PoM takes you to Cobalt Scar, if you're a melee
class you're still stuck there unless you want to run through Skyshrine,
Western Wastes, Kael, and Eastern Wastes to get to the Great Divide book.
Ugh ugh.

Given that, few melee choose to visit there regularly.  Casters have less of
a problem, since they can bind in PoM and use other means to get back to the
real world.  Still, few bother.

The upshot of it all is that the zone is virtually deserted.  The most I've
ever seen is six people, with two or three being the norm.

Seems fine to me... I'm getting 2% AA per kill.  A necro I was grouped with
mentioned that he could clear the entire theater - puppets, audience, and
all - and get almost a full AA.
