Im torn on this, the class dependance in eq shows a better design
concept, but sometimes it makes it hard to adventure if you are
missing one of the required classes. Nothing sucks more than standing
around begging for a cleric or shaman to join you.

Im not a seasoned AO player, but I will say that EQ's skill system
never worked for me really. Practice points really are kind of
useless, good for starting a skill and perhaps jumpstarting one a
little, but it seems silly that after a point, you pile up the points
with nothing really to do with them.

Gaaa, I struggled with implants for soooo long, I agree with you here.
And I lost soooo many credits messing around with the surgery clinics
(or whatever they were called).

One concept I really enjoyed from AO were the random dungeons that
were created on the fly and that only you (or your team) could enter.
Id love to see another game take this to the next level - with more of
a variety of configurations and more random elements. Nice going into
one of these dungeons and NOT having to shout... "CAMP CHECK PLZ", or
worrying about some fool training you ;)

This was a design decision from the start. I seem to recall it being
considered at one point, but with all the "cheat" macro programs
running rampant in UO, they made the decision to not alow it so that
you couldnt run programs in the background very easily.

Last time I heard, anyone can start the path to become a jedi, only
the truely dedicated (read: fanatic) would become one (i could be way
off on that however). That perma-death idea tho is a BAD idea, and im
not keen on the one character per account concept. Space combat is
coming in the first expansion. As for tradeskills, they want to make
them a viable path from the get go, unlike in EQ when it first started
when tradeskills seemed to be an after thought.

Theres a post recently on thier web site about a large gun battle that
took place and how "cool" and very star wars-ish it felt (ie... laser
bolts flying all about the chaos). I wonder if the stormtroopers will
be as bad a shot in the game as they were in the movies ;)

One thing i really hated about E&B, was that nomatter where you seemed
to go, you kept asking yourself, "Did i really go somewhere?". All the
space stations I went to were exactly the same. The layout and
configuration were identical. That was a huge turn off for me. I
really enjoy exploring, but there has to be a payoff to make it
worthwhile.

 
> UO - Shallow content, Griefers everywhere, really turned me off of PvP.

Aye, and when they made PKing legal for blues... I bailed. You couldnt
trust ANYONE (talking about how blues would manipulate the murder
count). I know they have trammel (or whatever) now, but too little too
late... the damage was done. PvP can be an interesting concept, but it
has to be controlled, or youll get griefing. In UO, they gave us the
tools to obliterate ourselves with little consequences. I think the
bounty hunter profession in SWG is an intriguing concept, giving
players motivation to hunt down the problem players.
