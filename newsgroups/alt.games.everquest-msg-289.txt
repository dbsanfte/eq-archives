  Milk, hm.  I believe the general store that is next to the bar with
the dancing skeletons sells milk.  Or it may be the bakery place that
sells milk, I'm not sure.  I know somebody in that town sells milk
though.
 
> Where can I find a list of towns with a Necro guild in them?

  Paineel, Qeynos, Freeport, Neriak, the Overthere outpost.  Ak'Anon and
Cabilis also have necromancer guilds, but because of faction problems,
you probably won't be able to visit them without a considerable amount
of faction work.

> Also do I lose exp if my skeleton makes the kill?

  If your skeleton does more than 50% damage to the target, then it
takes half of the experience for the kill, otherwise, pets don't take
experience.  So try to make sure you do more damage than your pet.  Of
course, it doesn't really matter that much in the Paineel newbie yard,
since your level 4 pet can kill most of the mobs there without much
trouble, and it can be quicker to send your pet off to kill one mob
while you kill another. :)
