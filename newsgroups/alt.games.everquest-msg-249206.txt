Thats a joke.
Seru key (arx key) requires you to kill 4 mobs (3 of which can be done with
2 people). The fourth mob is unslowable, so you need a third person.
VT key is complained about to much. All of the shards are easy to get, and
only one (ME) takes a while to camp.
I did my shawl quest just before my VT shards, and shawl took MUCH longer.
