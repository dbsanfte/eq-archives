Ah, spanky... Tell me you're being sarcastic or something. Surely
you're not that stupid.

Did you miss the part where he said he didn't play anymore?
Did you miss the fact that the software is useless without an account
or a key, and therefore, of COURSE the buyer will request the account?
Did you miss the fact that the EULA says transferring accounts,
PERIOD, is not allowed?
Did you miss the part where any charge above the value of the game
instantly becomes a charge for the account?
Or how about the part where HE DOESN'T OWN THE FUCKING ACCOUNTS?

Thought so. Now, go away.
