I actually liked the boats.  The Freeport-FV boat is where I did most of my
Safe Fall skillups.  :p  Too easy to just move around now.  Before, wizards
and druids made a lot more money doing their thing.  Now, between PoK and
LDoN, there are just a few ports you can't get to directly by hailing
someone.  It's gotten to the point of laziness, where people will beg for a
port for half an hour in PoK, for a port to NK, instead of going to the
Nexus.  Or for 30 minutes wanting a port from PoK to DSP.  Lazy...

A Boat Gnome is a gnome at a dock, when hailed, will allow you to teleport
to the next dock in line.  For example, you can't use a gnome at Freeport
docks to TL you to Qeynos docks.  You can take the Freeport gnome, and 2 TLs
later, you in FV.

Simplest put, it's the original LDoN Magus mold.  They are put in at boat
docks whenever boats are broken.
