Why should they?  The people who are still in EQ are the people who
absolutely love EQ, for whatever the reason (sentimental, degree of
difficulty, friends in game, knowledge of the game, desire to "see it
thru to end", whatever).  The EQ base has been  trimmed down of anyone
who isn't pretty devoted to it.  

My wife plays Star Wars: Galaxies, and that game is in pretty much the
same state.  It got completely changed, far more than EQ, and the
folks who are left are the die hards who just can't break away.  I
couldn't count how many times she's ranted to me about SoE deleting
one of the reasons she still plays and how she's going to quit right
away, but then she's back in it again.
