Having read many of the monk forums it seems that a monk's usefulness to a
group has been diminished.  Rogues are sought after more due to the fact
that they can out damage a monk.  Warriors are sought after due to their
mitigation advantage and their new abilities to generate hate.

After many parses of higher level monks it appears that there is a soft cap
on monk ac of 1340.  After that point, additional AC has little to no return
value.  Monks go through life with weight restrictions but, higher level
monks who actually are able to get their hands on excellent gear can easily
blow the 1340 AC soft cap away.  Then weight seems to no longer be an issue.
Big deal if you are over weight as a Monk, as long as your AC is over 1340
then you are still maxed out on your defense potential.

The Monk Mitigation Nerf took place before POP was released.  Having
researched this subject I learned that the nerf was intended to slow down
the top 5% of Monks but ended up hurting the entire class.  Now, some 18+
months after the Monk Mitigation Nerf, monks still have problems with POP
and above mobs going through them like a meat grinder.  Low end monks that
do not have decent equipment have this problem magnified.

One of the motivations for the Nerf seems to have been that Warriors were
complaining that they were being overlooked by groups for tankage duty or at
the least had to compete with Monks for tankage duty.  Well warriors now
have their new hate producing toys that Monks do not.  Since this is the
case, why not give Monks back their original mitigation abilities?
Beastlords who are suppose to be hybrids of monks can already out damage
monks and bring valuable tools to groups.  Rogues can out damage monks,
Warriors and Knights can generate more hate than monks and also have much
more hit points and better damage mitigation than monks.  Other than pulling
old world yard trash what else can monks do that would make high end groups
want them?
