I play in Australia and have never had any real problems with the distance,
EverQuest uses great client side prediction which cuts back on a lot of the
lag problems you'd see with other games.

That said there are 2 different hosts of EQ servers, although both in the
one area, one of them does seem to be overall better with Australian
players, although it wont be much you'll notice. If you want to find
the fastest, get a program like EQU:
http://members.telocity.com/~ericruess306/equ/
Once installed open server status, and hit the "ping" button, it'll
show you which have faster responses.

You'll find most servers are deserted in most Australian's play time (except
weekends.) Many people see this as a bonus though. : )
Try selecting "order by population" on the select screen and play on the
most
crowded if you want more people.
