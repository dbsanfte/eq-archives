That 1100 page book was so much fluff that I think I read it in less than a
week (casually) due to the huge numbers of pages I was safely able to skip.

Eleven hundred pages...that any editor with any sort of worth could get down
to 500 max.  What, does TC have a "no editing" clause in his contract??

Anyway, not flaming him, I like his books, even most of the non-Clancy
Clancy books.
