We had the same thing yesterday, also in Ruj. Had 27 out of 29 with
almost 25 left to go and didn't get another drop. Just out of
curiosity, was it the dungeon with a big cave full of bridges at the
end? Once we entered that room we didn't get a single drop off of what
must have been 20 mobs, it's almost like the loot table in that room
was buggie.
