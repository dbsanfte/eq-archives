Actually, in order to test high end content on the Test servers, 
beta testers have a /betabuff command that is similar to the existing
/testbuff command, except it makes the character 65 with a decent
number of AA and gear.  I know /betabuffed wizards get FT10 and several
level 4 focus items.  I'm waiting for the the relevant thread on
Graffe's to get locked and the person who revealed it to be booted
from beta for NDA violation.
