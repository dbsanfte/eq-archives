Another option at that level is probably hunting Desert Terantulas in South
Ro.  Same level as the WK spiders (I think) and roughly the same silk drop
rate.   The difference is in South Ro you usually have 5 or 6 Ancient Cyclops
hunters helping you kill them and leaving the corpses unlooted.

More danger though, as the desert part of South Ro has wandering ghouls (level
14 or so) and Desert Madmen (11 - 13 casters) which would kill him, and the
occasional Sand Giant as well, if the AC people are being lazy.

Oh, and Carrion spiders in EK can be safely killed in a group around level 12
or so.  Pull them over to the village and guardkill in case of an add.  It's
the Crag Spiders which you need to be 17'th for (they are 16 - 19) .

Well, you used to need to be 17'th to hunt the crags in a group.   Now that
they're permacamped by high level casters (especially tracking druids) you'll
probably have to wait until you can solo kill them, since trying to manuver a
group around to where they are before they get ganked by someone else would be
a major problem.  Likewise for getting to them and pulling them.   You won't
get enough to keep the group from being bored.
