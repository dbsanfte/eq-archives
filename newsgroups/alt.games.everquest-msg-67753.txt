And when Someone squeaks articulately, and coherently, they get
appropriate attention, when someone spams the newsgroup with an
incoherant repetative post with no details, just "boycott sony" then
smacking them is a duty, not a priveledge.

Notice, that DT hasn't smacked at or on anyone who is posting system
specs and looking for suggestions/help/and even money back.
