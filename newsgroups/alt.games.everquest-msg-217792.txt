	It's a regular invis, and one of the two types of seahorses guarding
Phinny sees through it.  Now that I think of it, I can't remember if Phinny
sees invis or not...I always pulled him from out of agro range anyway.

	No, there's nothing to test here.  That is exactly what will happen.

	This is your best option.  One strong 60s group with good gear can take
Phinny with no problem.  One 65 Necro can solo him on a good day, and a 65
WAR/SHM duo can probably take him any time.

	Phinny himself is not up all that often...if it's just the guards you'll
have an easier time of it.
