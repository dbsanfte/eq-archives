IANAL, but you dont have the right to have or use a cell phone. 

You may use a cell phone, but a private property owner is well within
his rights, as a matter of law, to throw you out when you do. A
private property owner may not toss you out for being a minority, or
based on your religeous creed, because that type of discrimination is
proscribed.

The government of any municipality can also terminate your usage of a
cell phone at any time. You cell phone is not a right, as defined in
the Constitution, and AFAIK the restriction of that right is not
pre-empted by Federal law, like federally licensed amatuer radio
operators. It stems from the common-law right to use property that you
own.

It is rude, and I wish that theatre owners would throw out rude
patrons on the first offense.
