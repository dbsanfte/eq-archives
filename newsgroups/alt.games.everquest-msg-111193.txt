You can solo in this zone if you are very carefull. When you reach the zone
ask someone for the location of the bowl (thats what its called on Tarew
marr anyways) this is a small dip in the terrain that has a hill behind it,
you can med to your hearts content and pull in the 'bowl' and kite them in
there (quite tight but very posible) I solo'd my ranger from 29-31 in there
to do the wak quest.
