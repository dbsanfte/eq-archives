You will not evade me, "NECP" <necp@spam.newenglandcomics.com>:

I don't have a fixed price for ports; I take what's offered. However,
it's my prerogative whether or not I want to do the port, if you shout
for a port for a donation it'd damn well better be more than 2 silver
(especially if I see you 5 minutes later auctioning phat lewt in the
next zone) and if you offer payment and then don't pay up, don't ever
expect me to port you or help you in any way again. I don't want to
have to start demanding my donations up front, so I just maintain a
list of people who should never ask me a favor again. 
(50 pp *is* still a considerable sum for me, and the person who was
paying that for a port for 2 and ran off as soon as they landed had
better not believe his 'thx' is going to make me forget that. It was
especially annoying since because they were 'late', I turned down a
polite, roleplaying dwarf who'd asked for a port in G fay and run to
the wrong town to meet me. I pointed the dwarf to another porter when
I would probably have enjoyed it more if I'd run to Felwithe and
ported just him for free. Hmm, seems I turned this into a rant... :) )

A simple concept not many people seem able to grasp.
