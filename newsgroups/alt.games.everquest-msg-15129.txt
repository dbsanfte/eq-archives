OMFG, I've been exploiting in CB when I was lvl 9. A lego was chasing me and
bashing me on the way. I knew the mobs do odd things near the entrance so
when I got there I immediately moved to one of the walls. the mob ran too
far, ran to the wall, ran from the wall again, and backtracked to get to me.
While he backtracked I rushed to it's previous spot at the wall so it had to
repeat the process. I kept this up until a pasing group put me out of my
misery.
This whole time I had just 1 sliver of health left so if I ran to the zone I
would most certainly have died.

I know it's a bug, I know I haven't reported it (assuming they know, because
EVERY player knows the pathing is terrible in CB) and I consciously used the
bug to my advantage.

Looks like I might get banned soon and my guild disbanded :(
