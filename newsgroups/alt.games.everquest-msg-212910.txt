 There have been many changes, I think what gets me most is seeing how much
our nuke sucks and pet, of course you learn this is part of being a
Enchanter because of all the cool things we can control.  I was really
having fun when I only had a few minutes spare time I'd go in Karnors and
use Tricksters Augmentation on my pet.  70DD proc was enough to offset the
green pet.  You get a pet at 55 that blue and at 56 it's light/blue.  That's
pretty sad but still he can solo if you do it right.  About 3 months maybe
ago they changed Tricksters Augmentation so it won't cast on my own pet.
That's crazy, what in the world could it hurt for my pet to taunt a little
with a proc that it's approximately 4 times a fight.  It just looked really
cool to have a imp pet that nukes.  I actually was enjoying EverQuest after
losing a close friend then some brain at Verant decided to take that little
ability away.  For what reason I don't really even understand.  I simply
felt Verant f***ing with me whenever they wanted and it destroyed my desire
to hit 65.  KEI took a nerf so I'm not going to make any money back for
paying some insane price in the bizarre to get it.  Frustration frustration
frustration it's greed everywhere.  I can honestly say that in 58 levels I
have NEVER, NEVER taken even 1 copper for clarity or even a breeze.  Maybe I
should have played cut throat like everybody else.  I've been KS'ed for rare
drops before from cockey wizards that just blew it away while I watched.
But the last straw was nerfing a spell that really did nothing except make
the game interesting to me.  I guess everyone else is satisfied playing
there enchanter as the traditional traffic cop.  I like to group, solo,
charm/fight or just mess around buffing total strangers probably even
hateful people that responded to my post in such a hostile way.  I have a
enchanter on 4 different servers so there's a fair chance I've tossed a
clarity or haste on whoever is reading this.

Hope you all have fun but I'm about finished.
