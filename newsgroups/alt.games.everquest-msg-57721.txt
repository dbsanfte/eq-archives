Actually, I don't. If Verant claimed to support foreign grammar in the 
naming conventions, this immediately commits them to enforce the naming 
policy in other languages too, and imagine the nightmare this would be... I 
mean, how do I know that "Hanrahan" doesn't mean frog-fucker in Lower 
Serbocroatian?

I think that the naming conventions are Anglocentric for a very good reason 
(and no, English is not my first language).
