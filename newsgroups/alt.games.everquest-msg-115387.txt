I'm a newbie (2 weeks) and have actually enjoyed starting in Everfrost...  I
found the maps at eqatlas and was off... It has been a great opportunity to
get a handle on the mechanics (keyboard, mouse), social conventions of
player interaction, and learning basic strategies without being
overwhelmed...  I first started to play in Freeport, but found it very
difficult just to get out of the city to kill snakes and spiders... g!


I've since been through BlackBarrow and to Qeynos [sic]...  There maybe
other, more exciting options, but Everfrost has served me pretty well...
