IIRC, it takes 5 to 7 points of agility to give 1 point of AC if your
agility is above 75 to begin with.  It does vary with class, monks
getting the best conversion of Agility to AC.  So if you are using
rings with only 1 point of AC, look for rings with more AC as they are
probably cheaper than rings with 10+ agility.
