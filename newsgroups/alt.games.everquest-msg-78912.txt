I've only killed one guard, so far!  It was a case of simple revenge.
My early days were filled with ignorance as I wandered from my home in
Felwithe.  One day I ventured into a rather dark forest area.  Of
course some time later I discovered why the guard in Nektulous had
beaten me to death.  The day finally came when that evil creature
would burn in the fires I had learned to command.
