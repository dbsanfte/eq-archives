Saw it again tonight. I think that makes 6 times, but am not sure. Took my
cousin with me and wouldn't know a Hobbit if it kicked her in the shin, but
she really enjoyed it. It's going away Friday, so I'll prolly see it twice
more.

sigh. This is sad.

I need to get a life. Oh, I have one! It's in EQ ;)

Thanks for playing.
