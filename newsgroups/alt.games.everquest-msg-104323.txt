If it makes it so that the mob doesn't have a chance
to hit you while you hit it, yes.

Not that I know of.  A lot of people do it, and I haven't
heard of anyone even being warned for it.

From the Everquest Rules of Conduct at:
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/conduct.jsp

   9. You may not intentionally cause experience loss to another
   player, such as by "training" them.  Training is defined 
   as pulling an NPC along behind you and attempting to get 
   it to attack another player who does not desire that engagement.

   The intentional training of NPCs will result in immediate 
   disciplinary action when witnessed by an EQCSR. We are aware 
   that accidents often happen causing unintentional trains, 
   and will scrutinize each report of this activity closely.

All of the rules of conduct are preceded by the following
preamble:

   FAILURE TO ACT RESPONSIBLY AND COMPLY WITH THESE RULES
   WITHIN EVERQUEST AND THE OFFICIAL EVERQUEST FORUMS MAY
   RESULT IN THE TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT WITHOUT ANY
   REFUND OF ANY KIND. 


>2) giving wps to mobs

Normally, no.  But if the weapon is insanely overpowered for
the mob and would be expected to wipe out people who could
normally be likely to beat the mob, it could fall under
the first sentence of #9 above.


>3) not helping ppl when they are dieing right in front of you... even
>tho you could insto kill the mob?

You are under no obligation to help anyone else in the game,
and failing to do so it not an offense.


>4) ninja looting

From the Rules of Conduct:

   2.  You may not ninjaloot.
   Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment 
   from a fallen creature without the express permission of 
   those who killed the creature if they are in attendance.

   The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand 
   near creatures that carry special items and attempt loot 
   that equipment prior to it being looted by the rightful owner.

Note that this is a bit different from the usual player
definition of the term, which usually means someone in
a group who loots a falling mob so quickly that few other
group members get a chance to loot it.  I doubt this is
considered an "offense", since players can easily handle
the situation themselves by simply booting the rude person
from the group if they don't share.


>5)Kill stealing

Again, from the Rules of Conduct:

   1.  You may not steal kills.
   Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for 
   any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player 
   or group without that group's specific permission.

   The intent of this rule is discourage and make note of 
   habitual Kill Stealers, not to punish those who honestly
   try to work together or those who make an honest mistake.
   Its enforcement by the EverQuest Customer Service Staff will
   reflect this philosophy.
