Both of those classes CAN solo, though the melee-based classes that seem 
to have the best luck soloing overall are monk and bard.  Neither is an 
easy class to solo, but they can do it.  I would rank SKs up almost as 
high as monks, but rangers are limited to animals only, which may be a 
problem at higher levels.
I solo'd my bard off and on over the various levels, and I really doubt 
you'll find a class that can solo untwinked as well as a bard, after level 
27.  Once you start twinking it changes thinks, hell, even a warrior can 
solo with the right gear.
I do have to see if I can solo the Guk King room finally.  When I tried it 
at 51 it was a very good thing that the zone is right there.  I did kill 2 
of his guards, but a 51 can't single-pull, so things get hairy, fast.  :)
