In Felwithe, the majority of your low level spells will be on vendors right
inside your guild; make sure you check all the rooms in the guild.  If I
remember right, there is also a vendor on the grass outside each guild (by
the water); check to see what they carry.

If you can't find your spells in your guild, check to make sure you're
actually in the right building.  Easy way to do that is to check the
trainers; if they let you train, you're in the right guild hall.  If they
tell you "You are not a member of <some other> class guild", you're in the
wrong building.

Some of your spells (mostly ones common to several classes, such as
Invisibility) are on vendors in the other building in the same zone as the
caster guilds: the one between the ramp and the zone point to the rest of
the city.

Not sure about magician components in Felwithe; if they're not on any of the
vendors at your guild, check the vendors in the other building I mentioned.
