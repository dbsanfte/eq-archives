Well, techncially they *don't* say that specifically. Had they said,
"turing in this pearl will *not* result in the spawning of a killable
version..." then that would be true. So, I can see how some folks may be
interpreting this as two ways to find a killable Zordak.  But
personally, I interpret it the way you do. I think there's only one, and
he's random every (up to) 72 hours.

No, they are not *removing* the bottleneck, but they are attempting to
reduce it's volume. Where you get that it becomes worse seems to be
shaky logic to me. Previously, the most often you could _ever_ see
Zordak was some time after Naggy went down, which could happen a maximum
of once per week barring patches. Now it sounds like clerics can get the
swirling pearl once a day, and can take a shot at Ragefire (dragon form)
at a maximum of of every three. Since he can pop again "up to" three
days, he might show up three days in a row.

Yes, I can see your concern that guilds might start trying to farm
Zordak, but if they nerf the loot table on him like they did on the
triggered Fey, that should shut that down quick enough. You've only got
so many clerics who are realistically near the end of their epics at any
given time.
