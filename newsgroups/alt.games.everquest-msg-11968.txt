I forwarded that to some friends, one of them sent this back to me
(revenge?):

EU Language



The European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby

English will be the official language of the EU rather than German

which was the other possibility. As part of the negotiations, Her

Majesty's Government conceded that English spelling had some room for

improvement and has accepted a 5-year phase-in plan that would be

known as "Euro-English".



In the first year, "s" will replace the soft "c". Sertainly, this will

make the sivil servants jump with joy. The hard "c" will be dropped in

favour of the"k". This should klear up konfusion and keyboards kan have

1 less letter.



There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when the

troublesome "ph" will be replaced with "f". This will make words like

"fotograf" 20% shorter.



In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be

ekspekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are

possible. Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters,

which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre

that the horible mes of the silent "e"s in the language is disgraseful,

and they should go away.



By the fourth year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing

"th" with "z" and "w" with "v". During ze fifz year, ze unesesary "o"

kan be dropd from vords kontaining "ou" and similar changes vud of

kors be aplid to ozer kombinations of leters.



After zis fifz yer, ve vil hav a reli sensibl riten styl. Zer vil be

no mor trubl or difikultis and evrivun vil find it ezi to understand

ech ozer. Ze drem vil finali kum tru! And zen ve vil tak over ze world!
