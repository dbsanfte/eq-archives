I've noticed this in Dreadlands, where if you go high enough up a mountain
and then Lev away from it you can basically travel "on top of the map",
where you dont actually gradually float down. Up there you get all sorts of
clip-plane distortions that make the graphics go weird, but that's the
nature of some 3D engines (well, certainly Quake 2 did something similar
aswell) and let's face it, the EQ gfx engine isn't the most sophisticated in
the world.
I think it's effectively a "feature" of the DL map, and any other map that
let's you do it, in that they let you go too high up the mountain instead of
putting one of those invisible walls in.
