They are supposedly (this is strictly rumor, i havent seen any verified 
posts by devs) going to have a server labeled UK prefered, geographically it 
won't be in the UK but it will give people in that time zone a place to 
meet. Also they will have one labelled Roleplay prefered but it won't have 
any special rulesets or anything, just a place for those that want to rp to 
meet, maybe they'll have others that way too.
