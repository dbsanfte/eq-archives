Since I slaved my hotkey slots 9 and 0 to slave to my
left and right arrows (see previous thread) I had a thought,
I dragged my open inventory down to both 9 and 0 spaces
on my raid hotkey page for my cleric, and in that spot I
put my spyglass, which has an instant cast click effect
(telescope, which is a bit annoying actually but you get
used to it)

We were going after the Dwagon, Faydedar, which is
one of the many dispelling mad mobs.  A way to preserve
your buffs in the face of this sort of effect is to get an
insta click buff item, put -that- buff in your number one
buff slot, and keep clicking it to put it back up every time
it gets dispelled.

Since I"m usually pretty busy during a fight like that, I
have a hard time remembering to keep clicking on the
spyglass every time I'm not casting something else.

However I -do- wriggle around a lot, turning left and right
not only to see whats going on, but to make sure the system
knows I've stopped moving so I don't get lag based interrupt
on my casting.  Almost every caster out there is sure to
know what I mean, at any rate this means that I have a -long-
ingrained habit of hitting the left or right arrow just a touch
before casting anything.

Sure enough, I did a lot better in this fight, kept four of my
16 buffs up thru the whole thing, although I did lose the trash
buffs and eventually some of the good ones, I kept Blessing
of Aegolism, KEI, BAOR and Circle of Winter... which are
the ones I really cared about.

On the other hand, I did find a flaw with my reasoning; at one
point I picked up a Mod2 rod for more power, ate a charge,
and dashed in to heal some more.. and promptly ate another
charge.  Of course I'd put the rod in my open inventory slot,
and I had the turn arrows slaved to that slot!  Luckily I had
plenty of HP at the time, but that could easily have been a
mod rod death.
