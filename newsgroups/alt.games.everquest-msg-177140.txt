I have something similar happen.  Sometimes the mouse locks up, and 
sometimes the keyboard too.  I can usually run the game by hitting enter 
(to get into a character) and eventually doing Alt-Enter once or twice. 
  If the keyboard is locked and this doesn't work, try 
control-Alt-Delete to get the task manager (if you're running an OS that 
has it) and switch back to the game and hit enter and wait a few 
minutes.  Oh, also try Alt-Shift-R to free up the mouse.  If nothing 
works you might try waiting a week or two since they are still working 
out the bugs in the windowed version of EQ.  I suspect once they enable 
windowing for the character select screen your problem will go away or 
at least you will have an easy workaround.

If all else fails try logging in on a friend's computer to make sure 
your character isn't stuck somewhere.

I remember that problem.  Hasn't happened to me in quite a while.

I think it has more to do with problems with the windowed mode of EQ.

Your characters and equipment are saved on the SOE servers, so no 
worries there.  The only thing you will lose with a reformat is your hot 
key settings and friends list and things like that, which you can easily 
set up again in a few minutes.
