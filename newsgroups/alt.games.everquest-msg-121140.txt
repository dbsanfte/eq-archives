Nah, more like.. *usually*, or *more often then not* (*almost always* is
probably more accurate) the rez timer stops.

As some of you are finding out though, when it doesn't stop.. gm's dont do
shit.  At least it wasn't just Zrinic (prexus lead gm) being a fuck with me

I got trade scammed a long time back.. Zrinic said in an email, "if you read
the website.. you will see our policy on trades means I cannot reimburse
you.  I cannot go against what the website says, period.  Im sorry, good
luck on your journeys."

I had my corpses poof at 59 (several) before, even tho I had been logged in
the game less than 10 mins after deaths.. this time when I emailed him I
wasn't going to make the same mistake again.. I emailed him with a cut and
paste of the rez timer policy from the website.

Zrinic said in an email, "well it appears there is an error on the website.
Im sorry, I can't return your experience though or help you in any way.
Good luck on your journeys"

FUCKER!!!^!*^!*&  I still remember it so well /cry
