People are already raising their tailoring to 158 to make the Coldain prayer
shawls.  125 for the second best pack in the game would be trivial, and
people would do it, because it's still cheaper than the 5K for the Tinker's
Bag.

And this is the problem with this approach.  If you make a nice item that
can only be made with a tradeskill, then you'll get a lot of people that
take up the tradeskill just to get the item.  The better approach is the
current one, where people can make and sell the items.

I liked the first 4 shawl quests a lot more then the ones that came after. 
I already had all my skill high enough to do the first 4 quests one right
after the other.  It was a nice perk.  But the high tailoring requirement
was just insane...

It's streaky.  You get streaks in random output.

Other than do /random for a couple of hours an analyze the results, I don't
think there's any way to prove or disprove any bugs in the RNG.
