And you, poor guy, grew up in the ISP world, and think that passing
data and serving files is the toughest thing a computer ever has to
do.

You are about to stand corrected...

"The entire EverQuest (EQ) universe (at present, 40 separate worlds)
is run on approximately 1,000 servers. These are located in our onsite
datacenter and at AT&T CERFnet (in San Diego, less than a mile from
our offices). The mix is about 60/40 (here vs. AT&T CERFnet)."

Quote from interview at www.hostingtech.com/eb/01_06_everquest.html of
Adam Joffe and Scott McDaniel, both of SOE.


You see, EQ world servers aren't merely passing information from point
A to point B like your 300-user ISP machine did. They're performing
calculations. Lots of calculations. Like tracking positional data for
every PC and NPC in a zone, determining fight hits and misses,
operating pathing for NPCs, handling database information for spawn
tables, loot tables and merchant goods, and each PCs individual
information, running the AI for NPCs, passing communications among all
the servers that make up a single world, and so on.
