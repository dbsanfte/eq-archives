Remember, Artifact Entertainment created the Demise game engine
several years ago.  It is outdated and a bit buggy.  They discontinued
further support of Demise so they could work on their Horizons MMORPG.

I only see someone using the Demise engine as a model for another
single player or small multiplayer game...not an MMORPG.  It would
need significant improvement and maybe even starting from scratch.
Demise was a good game for its time but it was also widely
undiscovered due to poor marketing.
