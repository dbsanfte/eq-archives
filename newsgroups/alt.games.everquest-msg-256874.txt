There are enough people in Karnors to train?

I've been there 4 times over the last 3 weeks, once for Venril Sathair, once
for Venril Sathair Remains and twice to get groundspawn words for a VP
quest.  (Whee, just need one more set of words :D)

Twice we were the only people there.  Once there was a level 43'ish druid
soloing in the entrance.  The other time it was really busy, 3 level 40's
grouping in the entrance, and a level 65 monk soloing Hand room for his epic
drop.

Hard time thinking of Justice as being good though.  Seems like a long
static camp, for no real reason.   And I generally try to avoid camping when
I possibly can :p
