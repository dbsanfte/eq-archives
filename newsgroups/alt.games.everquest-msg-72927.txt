Greetings- sorry if this is a topic covered before but as I am running a new
computer entirely, the newsgroup data I was able to download didn't have any
information I could find on the topic.

Even after installing the complete game from scratch (and also trying to
copy a fully patched version of all EQ expansions (downloaded at work on DSL
then burned 3 CDs and copied them to the hard drive), everquest refuses to
believe all my files are present, and forces me to download 40 hours worth
of patches (even on a 56k modem i know its not 40 hours to patch ).
Currently I am running on windows XP (home version - Ugh)  and realize that
this may be part of the problem. I have updated this installation of xp with
all the present patches as well. This is a brand new system with only the xp
files installed and nothing else - no virus scanners active either. The
files are shared for access to all users as well as having been installed by
the Administrator of the network - me !! If anyone is able to offer any
suggestions please feel free to do so - I have submitted this to EQ tech
support as well but often it seems I get better results by querying this
group <grin>. One solution I have already tried included manipulation of
values in my xml file regarding textures and such.

Again thank you for any help or advice you are able to offer.............

John
