Have the SK or Cleric whip up the "Sense the Dead" spell, and use 
it often.  The Crusaders are Shadow Knights, and will cast a
skeleton pet, which your spell will detect.

The Ritualist has a skeleton pet also, which is no problem,
because he drops the SK quest items also.

The only catch is that the Avatar of Fear also will have
a skeleton pet if he's up, which will interfere with your
Sense the Dead tests.

And no, you don't want to attempt the AoF at your level.

Yes, quite.

The nice thing about Lower Guk is that it's easier closer
to the zone, and gets progressively harder as you go deeper.
So you can take a peek inside and test it out, then
head slowly in to find your best "not too hard, not too
easy" spot.

True, but it's such a fun "dungeon"...

No, actually, you should be just about right for Dalnir.

Shouldn't be *too* hard, but keep in mind that the EE is
an Enchanter, and try to keep everyone's Magic Resistance up,
or else you're likely to find one of your group members waging
war on all the others.
