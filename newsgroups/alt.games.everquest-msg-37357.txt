I have found a good solution to the SOW problem. If people ask me nicely and are
in cast range they get sow. If someone beg for sow for a CR they get Scale of
Wolf. Its faster than sow, so theyll get their corpse faster, but if they lied
and just wanted a free sow theyre gonna get a hell of a surprise first time they
attack or try to cast a spell.
