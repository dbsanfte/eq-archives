Well at level 65 and with a year's time playing behind me this has 
rarely been a problem in my experience. I think you are magnifying it 
well out of proportion. You make a good case for what could happen to 
players who are mentally challenged to begin with and they were and are 
still out there but really, is playing any character in EverQuest all 
that hard to be good at by the time you've come to 65? Does having it 
easy as a low level toon sometimes really cripple everyone who does it 
so they remain incompetent for the entire time they play the game, 
however far they come up in levels? Is that really possible? Personally 
I don't think so for any player who's got anything at all between his or 
her ears.

I got buffs a fair amount of times as I was coming up and went without 
plenty of times too. I don't think it hindered me in the least in 
learning to play my class effectively. But it was fun when I had them.
