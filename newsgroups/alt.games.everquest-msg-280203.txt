Upon reflection you are right re pricing vs billing. But to your comment 
that they can send an updated bill: they aren't sending me an updated 
bill. They are helping themselves to the difference off my credit card.

And THAT, imo, is what pisses people off!

Most business would eat the loss of a couple bucks rather than suffer 
the ill-will associated with simply helping themselves to some more 
money of the card number you've entrusted them, or the hassle of sending 
the customer an updated bill for $2.00.

That's really quite a different scenario entirely. Those bills only 
cover estimated usage. We -expect- and its reasonable to expect more 
precision from SOE.

Duh! But paying up the missing $2.00 and taking a month off is a net 
loss of $14.95 for SOE.
