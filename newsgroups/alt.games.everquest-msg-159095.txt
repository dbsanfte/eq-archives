What if you were to drag him near an NPC who attacked him?  Since you'd be the
only thing on his hate list, would he summon you?  If so, then the "DS adds
hate" angle of this isn't an issue.

Not if you aren't KOS to them.  If you aggroed one and didn't mem blur it
somehow, yes, that one will go for you over the NPC mob.  But any mob that
doesn't hate you and you didn't anger it, will not blink no matter how close you
get while its fighting something else.

I used several variations on this plan too... but if one of the mobs didn't hate
me (say a coldain war wolf, very handy for softening up Drakkal dire wolves) and
lived, it still didn't hate me.  And it wouldn't attack me if I came close,
although the dire wolf would.

My favorite trick was to get my prey in close to a coldain wolf, root it, and
let them fight, then when the drakkal started to run, I'd root the coldain and
atone him, then go kill my drakkal target.  If the coldain managed to KS me I
was only out a little time and very little mana.  If the coldain died, I could
either go find another, or if the drakkal was damaged enough, kill it.  I called
the plan "cleric charm"
