Which doesn't really matter, because they would just pop up back at their 
spawn points a few minutes later, and in another planet.

I've sort of stopped feeling guilty about killing things in EQ. Now it's 
more of, 'okey laddie, back to yer spawn point with ye. See you back in a 
minute'. The existence of NPC soulbinders confirms tha non-permanent 
death is not just a game mechanism, but a law of nature in the Norrathian 
milieu. This doesn't explain under which circumstances some NPCs do die 
permanently, like Cros Treewind. That would make an interesting story.
