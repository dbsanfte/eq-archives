I think the biggest problem is the putzes selling plat for $$$ ... 
banning there accounts is hardly punishment... if they made 1000.00 
bucks off the dupe bug, its only 30.00 bucks to buy another evolutions 
box...

SOE needs to ban people, not accounts.

Heh...Too bad people are impossible to identify. Maybe SOE should be 
allowed access to the various fbi, police, interpol and other 'homeland 
defense' profiles to track these people. :)

/cackles maniacally thinking about all the invasion of privacy already 
legitimized by the 'homeland defense' paranoia... and wonders how long 
before an SOE rep says... "If you don't cheat you have nothing to hide! 
I don't understand why so many people have a problem with this!? Come, 
let us put the 'mark' on you, its really for your own convenience... 
Besides you already agreed to it last time you logged in."
