Me either. Its a pretty zone, and I like it on its own merits on its own 
but its not lavastorm anymore. I'd have liked to see the facelift 
preserve the original.

For the longtime players there's something about going back to an old 
zone and knowing the layout like the back of your hand... its a -good- 
thing.

New zones are good too, and I'd never stand in their way... I'm just not 
impressed with replacing chunks of the landscape with new terrain just 
because they can.
