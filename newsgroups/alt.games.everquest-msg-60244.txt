The majority of them, to my knowledge,  are located in San Diego,
California, which is west coast US, just for reference's sake.

You may want to consider the Antonious Bayle server when you start. It's
recently released, and took transfers of characters from a good many
servers. However, it's basically a UK server, so you'd be much more likely
to find people to play with who're +/- 2 hours of your own time zone.
Otherwise, your choice of server is pretty irrelevant... each of them is
*basically* the same, in terms of guilds, new players, etc.
