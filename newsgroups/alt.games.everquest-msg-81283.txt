Not much time, just two comments.

YAY!  Velious is back open to me again :-). I'd been bound
in Shadowhaven before the soulbinders were even there,
and just hadn't spent much time in Velious since an
un-aided CR (the only kind I always plan on, even though
I haven't died without a rez in about a year now) was so
much more convienent from Nexus to Norrath.

Great Divide is the perfect place for it, too.
