>4) guards at outpost who will help with overpulls, or trains

Hm. I've been in the Overthere for a bit with a teens group of DE's (where 
we *never* overpulled--it's virtually impossible for a group of four 18's).  
Over the weekend, I decided to solo a bit with my 18 Enchanter DE.  I tried 
charmed pets, and, as usual, got my own personal train out of it.

I decided that my mana was too low for comfort, and ran for it.  "Help, Mr 
Cliff Golem!"  Nothing.  I'm pretty sure that I was in the Iron Guardian's 
aggro range, too.  So I frantically memblurred (interrupt... interrupt... 
yay!), and managed to live.  So I dunno: the guards might help with Sarnaks 
or rhinos (I have seen dragoons whomping on rhinos), but against 
succulents, tigers, or cockatrices, they seem not to care much.

(I also love the fact that the family language filter makes them little 
chickens into "mrglatrices"...)
