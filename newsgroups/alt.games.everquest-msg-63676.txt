Recap:  How to raise faction with Captain Rottgrime at the outpost so you 
can hand in braids.

Steve said:
}I have heard you can have a Necro duel you and hit you with ignite
}bones.  While in skele form you are indifferent to the Captain.
}Never tried it myself yet, but I am sure going to just for fun..

Two other possibilities:

Amulet of Necropotence confers Illusion: skeleton.  Ok, so you have to 
kill highly uber mobs in fear.  Or find someone selling one and cough 
up a huge bucket of plat.  Ouch.

Any of the Illusion: Elementals will raise my faction there.  A Clay Golem 
in Cazic Thule drops a Ball of Golem Clay with one measly charge of 
Illusion: Earth Elemental.  I haven't tried it, since I've yet to actually 
see a clay golem, despite many hours spent looking for the bugger, but 
there it is.

If anyone has any pointers for finding him, I'd love to hear 'em. :)
