I can't imagine how a 34 druid could solo in the Bartender area.  The mob
density is so high that the minute you uncloak (assuming there are no see
invis mobs on the way) you'll have 10 goblins beating on you.  Even if you
try to approach cautiously and clear mobs slowly on the way, you're bound to
get multiple adds from roamers and even statics with the huge agro range
players have at 34.
