}   Well, I know this going to sound egotistical, but my favorite type of
}loot system is were Lenny masterloots, and I sell then split, minus the
}cost of dots for all save Lenny and I.  This is because I know I am
}fair, and that no one is going to get screwed out of anything.  The
}problem with this, of course, is that unless the rest of the party knows
}me well, there is no compelling reason to assume that this is so.  

Naw.  I'd trust you.  But then I'm too trusting. :)

}   FFA play nice is ok too, provided everyone really pays attention to
}the Play Nice part.  And if I notice that the mage hasn't looted in a
}couple of cycles, and I do try to pay attention to that sort of thing, I
}will tell the group "Splend next loot."  But I am not perfect, and if
}someone has to be told every time, then yes, they are probably going to
}get a lesser share.

And I think that's really the only sane way to do it.  Especially because 
with any other system, people have no motive to get right on it and clean 
up that corpse before some poor gnome gets buried in them and can't target 
what he wants to mezz.  Especially in BoT.  Dang stupid giants, dying all 
over the place.  Bah!

}   Alpha is my least favorite.  I got better things to do than keep
}track.  And it is easy for someone to get screwed by a bad run with the
}random generator.  Unless other provisions are made for the dots, then
}the cleric will pretty much always get screwed.  However, I also dislike
}the "system" of the cleric looting everything regardless of dot expense,
}and pocketing the difference, to hell with everyone else.  No, this
}isn't a system... this is robbery.

Alpha's my least favorite too.  Especially the way it is most used on 
Ayonae Ro, which is FFA, but alpha if something vaguely cool or valuable 
drops, but not important enough to actually roll on.  So like, research 
components just get sucked up, the fat behemoth in the corner an earlier 
poster worries about gets rolled on, and gems pretty much get alphaed.  
Which is all fine and dandy if you're at NG in seb, but people like to use 
it everywhere.  And since most camps I'm at have one such gem thingy drop 
per hourish, and most groups last a maximum of four hours before 
everyone's too tired to focus anymore, and people like to restart the 
alpha order every freaking time more than one person leaves the group and 
has to be replaced, guess who's REALLY sorry his name begins with a Z.  I 
did a bit of math a while back, and figure my name starting with Z has 
cost me about 20K in the last year, compared to what someone with a name 
starting with oh, M, or something makes.  Yea, that's one hell of a fair 
system.  And the only way I can try to get fairness is by saying 'how 
about -reverse- alpha this time' and explaining the problem over and over 
and basically making myself look like a total whiner, just because I'd 
like to actually have something to show for it after being in a group for 
4 hours.  And of course the only times people actually -do- agree to 
reverse alpha and don't just tune me out are the times 6 gems actually 
drop and my complaint was groundless.

}(unless the ML is someone besides the leader whom all trust who sudden 
}goes insane and makes off with the take). 

I've noticed an alarming increase in this happening in LDoN pickup groups 
lately... anyone else seeing that?
