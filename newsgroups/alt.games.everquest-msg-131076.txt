Don't boggle.  That's downright sensible considering some of the
things I've seen.  One guy in NK auctioning for MORE than an hour for
a TP to WC.  A guy in SRo auctioning 20pp for a tp to WC.

Never, ever underestimate the laziness of your fellow human beings.

I dunno if I'd call it a fleecing.  I was sitting up in the top of the
traders building in the bazaar with /role up and he still sent me a
tell asking for a port.  How the hell he even knew I was a druid, I
dunno.  I must be getting a reputation as a soft touch or something.
