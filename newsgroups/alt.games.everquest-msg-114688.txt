Which we never claimed to be, certainly.  However, I disagree with the 
idea that non-uberguilds shouldn't assign loot.  We do raid quite often, 
at least 5 out of 7 nights of the week.  Not *uber* things, but we are 
raiding frequently enough.

The problem *her* is that certain individuals don't understand the concept 
of benefit to the guild over benefit to the self.  Those in a succesful 
guild (I rather dislike the term uber guild, but I won't get into that) 
understand it well.  It's one of the reasons they ARE successful.

One of the reasons smaller guilds, even those with skilled people, are 
held back many times, is because of the lack of understanding on the part 
of too many player of this concept.

In our guild, the leader alone does not make the assignment - the 
assignement is made by votes from a committee - a committee made up of 
officers and raid leaders, usually about 7 people or so in on that.

And more often, it is demonstrable that people leave for "higher level 
guilds" because the guild isn't doing enough, isn't progressing.  The idea 
we've operated with over the last 6 months is that we don't won't people 
to leave because we aren't progressing.  The membership was polled, asked 
what they wanted the leadership of the guild to prioritize.  The answer 
was unanimous - keep progressing.

/random on loot results too often in loot going to first or short time 
attendees or characters that won't put it to as good of a use as others.  
That is *not* what progresses the guild.
