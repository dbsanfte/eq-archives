I thought of one.  Nobody tell.  

You just need to have two spell lines:  Dispell Good Juju, which can only 
be cast on mobs or PvP, and Dispell Bad Juju, which cannot be cast on mobs 
or PvP.

But I don't wanna use two spell slots for that...

Hmm.  I take it back.  DGJ would be overpowering unless you could also 
accidentally strip your own group's bad juju with it.
