/shrug

In the real world you'd probably notice a platoon of chain & plate 
troops clomping around behind you without turning around.

Get over it. The radar shouldn't let you see behind walls, but when done 
as a compensator for the lack of situational awareness cues its not a 
bad thing.

Yeah the majority also think its pretty stupid they lose complete track 
of things the moment they aren't in the front 90 degree arc.

Now you're just ranting.

EQ has that too in most zones.

Bob is welcome to write one. I can't think of a better solution to the 
problem. Play the game of RL, and finish the quest of developing a 
mmorpg that you like. Its perfect for you... its right down to the 
roots, no automap, no radar, and you'll really have to work for what you 
get. ;p
