He played to the lo-fifties in a raiding guild as an intelligent and
observant person.  The wonder would be if he <didn't> understand the
strengths of those classes (and it's sad that so very many people
group with them regularly and remain clueless).  I've never played
any caster but a Druid past L17, that does not make me ignorant of
what casters bring to the table.  I've never played a Monk or a Rogue
at all, that does not make me blind to what they do in my groups.  I
know a lot more about <how> to play a Paladin effectively than any
other class, as my only char over 40 is a 55 Paladin, but that does not
stop me from knowing (a) <what> other classes can do, and (b) in what
circumstances they can do it.  In fact, I'd be a piss-poor Paladin
if I lacked that understanding, as is pretty much true of any character
called upon to fill a flexible support role.

He's not underestimating anything.  He's lamenting the ignorance of
those who do.

Oh yes, definitely make sure to solo your caster alt to 50 as fast as
you can while dismissing any negative comments.  Make sure that SOE
sees mostly casters out there so they spend most of their efforts to
satisfy all those players.  After all, if most of the characters are
solo casters that must be what the players want, right?  There's no
chance in hell that what's really going on is that the game balance
is so badly broken that melees have become comparatively unplayable
except as PLed twinks.

Every class that KEI helps solo already could solo.  Some were not all
that effective solo, but all could solo and make sustained progress.
The classes that could not solo without massive twinking are thoroughly
screwed by KEI, not only does it give them no benefit, it provides an
overwhelmingly powerful disincentive to grouping for many other players.
