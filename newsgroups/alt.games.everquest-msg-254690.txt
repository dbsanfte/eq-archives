I'm pretty sure the Intimidation level obtained is wrong, I think I've 
had it since first level, but if not certainly by a very low level.

What's the formula for the per level cap?  I know its 5 per level, but 
some skills its 5 per level plus 5, and some skills its just 5 per 
level, right?  Which are which?  (I know for priest classes some skills 
are 4 per level and for caster classes those skills are 3 per level, but 
I assume for a Berserk everything is either on the 5 per level or the 
"you can't get this skill" plan)

At level 32 this would mean my cap on everything is either 160 or 165.

Its good to see I'm not just stuck on dodge, its quit going up because 
its capped till I hit 51.  Haven't hit the Parry cap quite yet.

Double Attack isn't even at my level cap for 31 yet, I think its around 
130; my sticking to big slow 2 handers is really telling there I think, 
and I could probably improve my damage output by getting a fast two 
hander to work for a while, even if the actual ratio is lower and so 
lowers my output while training up, when I switch back to the big guy 
I'll be getting more double attacks.  I should work 2hb and 2hp anyway, 
are there any cheap fast weapons in those categories I could pick up to 
train with?  I think people used to reccomend some kind of shovel.

Frenzy is also lagging behind, I think its at around 135, despite my 
near constant use of the skill; I did work kick instead for a little 
while while in the single digits, but you can imagine how short a time 
span that really was.  The natural fix for this would be to plunk 
training points into it, but I've been spreading those points between 
intimidate and kick.

The really embarassing skill on this list is bandage; I didn't use the 
skill at all till almost 20, because I was almost always grouped with 
healers, or soloing, and solo I didn't really mind just the natural 
sitting regen they have these days.  Besides, at over 1pp a stack they 
were too expensive.  Trouble is, lately I've been in quite a few groups 
with no healer at all, so its kill kill kill kill kill, sit and bandage 
up; having a crap skill there is dramatically increasing our down time. 
  Well, at least this skill is going up rapidly now, and I make a point 
of soloing and using it even though it might be simpler to just sit 
somewhere safe and read the paper for a bit longer.
