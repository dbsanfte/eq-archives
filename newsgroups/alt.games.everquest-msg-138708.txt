As others have pointed out, you are thinking of Manastones.  They only work
in the Old World, in zones other than Cazic Thule (and other than the
Planes, if you count those as Old World).

The Manastone was the second-stupidiest item ever introduced into EQ, which
is why Verant has nerfed them so hard.  (Besides only working in original
Old World zones, they stopped dropping, so newer servers have none in
circulation).  What a Manastone does is provide a right-click effect that
converts health into mana, at a ratio of 3 to 1, with no casting time and no
recast time, so basically you can convert 3N health into N mana *very*
*rapidly*.

Why is that so unbalancing?  Consider a Cleric.  Suppose the Cleric, with
buffs, has 2400 HP and a Manastone.  A few seconds later, the Cleric has
near 0 health, and has gained 800 mana.  The Cleric then casts Complete Heal
on himeself, and 10 seconds later, has 2400 HP, and 400 of that 800 mana
gain left.  Let's be generous, and assume a slow-clicking Cleric, so it took
10 seconds to do the Manastoning down to near 0.  Net result: gain of 400
mana every 20 seconds.  That's effectively mana regen at 120 mana/tick.
That is so insanely unbalancing that it is not even funny.

Even with the nerfs, the Manastone is powerful.  Get port to Old World, do
your Manastone stuff, gate back to your group.  Sure, it takes
longer...might knock your effective regen down to 60 mana/tick, which is
still something like 2 times what is possible to get by any other means.

Why did I call it the second-stupidest item ever introduced?  Because of
Donal's Breatplate, which gave Clerics a right-click mana-free Complete Heal
every 30 seconds.  With that, if you had a mob that a Warrior could do
damage to faster than the mob regened, and that could not kill the Warrior
in 30 seconds, then a Warrior and Cleric duo could take down that mob.  Get
three or so Clerics doing a CH rotation with their DB, and almost all high
end encounters became trivial.  That's why DB was the stupidest item every
purposefully introduced into the game.

There are health->mana items still in the game, but they have limits, like a
casting time, so that they don't provide insane overall mana regen rates
when combined with CH, or with other tricks for getting back health.  (E.g.,
the Wizard epic.  The Wizard epic gives the Wizard a free ~800 point damage
absorber.  Mana conversion items work on the damage absorber, so an epic
Wizard can click his epic staff, then mana convert 800 points into ~270
mana, and then repeat as needed.  Because of the cast time on the epic and
the currently dropping mana convert items, this just gives the Wizard a very
nice mana regen, but one that is within the bounds of what the game is
designed to handle).
