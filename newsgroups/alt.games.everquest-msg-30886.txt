I looked a bit at the quests availible now and none is doable by me,
in one of the quest you had to give the guy 200pp, i'm out at this
point since that is way to much for a poor lvl well very low :) 
a hint snowbunnies did con blue and black to me lol

And of the same reasons killing something would be out of the question
as well :)

What kind of stuff can one find at them merchants? looking for armour,
weapons and maybe some cheaper jewelry, trying to save up for a
coldain dagger for my wiz or mage but they do cost some 70-80pp
