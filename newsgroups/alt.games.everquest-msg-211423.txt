You can put a pause on the same line as a command,
but the pause happens AFTER the command (listed
before the command).
Here's how I'd do it.

/stand
/pause 2, /target <party member>
/gasy Incoming heal on %t, don't panic!
/pause 30, /cast 2
/sit

If you don't need the heal message you can do it like this:

/stand
/pause 2, /target <party member>
/pause 2, /cast 2
/pause 25, /cast 2
/sit

This takes care of most fizzles.
