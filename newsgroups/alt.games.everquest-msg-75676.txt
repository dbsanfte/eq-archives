So last night, I'm running from South Ro to Freeport.

This means running through Oasis.

Before I had managed to go from the SRo zone to the lake itself, I get 2
(two) tells asking me to powerlevel them, and 3 (three) requests to "come
clarity me i pay you".

This had to have been within the first 15 seconds of zoning in.

When in Oasis, I usually stop at the docks and toss off a few buffs, but this 
time I just ran right by.  Didn't stop that one guy from following me all the
way to the zone going "Hail, Pasketti" all the way.

I just want to know - Do they have "/who enchanter" on a hotkey so they can
hit it every few seconds?

I mean, sheesh.  I made it through those levels without clarity, and this
was before Breeze was in the game, nor did I beg for powerleveling.

Is it just Oasis, or is this normal conduct nowadays?
