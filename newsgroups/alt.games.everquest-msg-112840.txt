We had a new recruit (60 warrior) get a ST key shortly after joining (we
needed another warlord that played real early EST for ST.. but a lot of
people sure were pissed off)

He didn't get the next primal that dropped.. and promptly de-guilded lol.

He came to grab some faction or something on our recent AoW attempt, after
we had just accidently agrod the Idol and wiped (oops...).. we managed to
get a cleric camped at least..

So anyway when the cleric logged back in to rez people, that ex guildie
stumbled into the Idol.. and ran to *us* with it...  /mourn the only cleric
that managed to camp in the first place
