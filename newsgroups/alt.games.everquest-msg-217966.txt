There are 4 types of ships in EQ to sail the sea of Norrath.  The normal
method of embarking on a voyage is to wait at the dock and get on from
there.  However if the guards around the dock don't like you, they wont let
you do that.  Or if you want to be stealthy getting onboard, like on PVP
server, one must know how to get on the ship from water.  Here are the lists
of few techniques I tried and worked.  Will someone fill in the blank?

1) Ship that sails in Erud's Crossing and OOT: While ship is stopped, swim
in front of it and let the ship you over, when it gets going.
2) Ship that sails between Oasis and OT in Timorous Deep: The small shuttle
raft can be boarded from all around.  The main sea going barge can be
boarded from port aft port side while stopped.
3) Ship that sails between BB and Firiona Vie: Shuttle?  Ship?
4) Ship that sails between Nro to Iceclad Ocean: The small shuttle raft can
be boarded from all around.  No need to get on the ship from water because
NPC is friendly to both good and bad races.

I tried to cross to the sea zone by swimming at the location where ship or
shuttle crosses the zone, but I couldn't zone there.  The zone can be
crossed only on ship of shuttle.
