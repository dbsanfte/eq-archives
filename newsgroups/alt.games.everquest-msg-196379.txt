Raise your CoV ( Claws of Veeshahn) faction to dubious or better. The drakes
will then leave you alone. CoV faction can be raised by killing Frost
giants, and Drakkel Dire Wolves in GD and EW, but thats the slow way. If you
can manage it get into a Kael group thats hunting the arena. Faction hits in
Kaeal Drakkel are a LOT bigger. Worst case you could also hunt the zone
lines of Kael, either on the Wakeninglands side, or the Eastern waste side.
Faction hits arent as big as in the arena ( so Ive heard ) but they are
bigger hits than what you would get from EW or GD Frost Giants. If you do
decide to hunt the Keal/Wakening Lands zone line be EXTREMELY cautios about
porting in to WL until you have Dubious or better CoV faction. Woushi, a
full fledged dragon, has his lair right next the WL druid port in spot, and
he will agro and kill you SO fast if your kos to CoV. That can make for
BRUTAL corpse recovery. Trust me on this, I had to pay a necro to Summon to
the Kael zoneline for me when Woushi had me for breakfast :) The good news
seems to be that Woushi doesnt seem to stay up for very long on a non-pvp
server :)

Also, if Wyverns are not to your likeing, you can always try to quad kite,
or root/rot the raptors in Timorous Deep ;)

Good Luck regardless of what you do :)
