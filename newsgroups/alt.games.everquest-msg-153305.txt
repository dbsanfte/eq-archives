    When I was a young cleric, I once saved up enough money (I hoped) to buy
a new weapon - a Fine Steel Morning Star. So I auctioned to buy one, and as
luck would have it another dwarf sent me a tell saying he had one to sell!
But when I asked how much, it was more than I had and I told him so. He
asked me to come to where he was anyways. When I got there, he put the FSMS
in the trade window and told me, "You can take it. Just hold still for a
while." He seemed like such a nice person, and he wanted to get a screenshot
of me with it obviously! Beeming with pride, I equipped my new weapon and
mentally said "cheese".

    I stood. And stood. He wasn't saying anything, and he wasn't moving
around to get a better angle. He just stood there, and every so often his
character twitched like he'd hit the movement keys by accident. A high-level
character ran past us, and as I turned to get a better look at him the dwarf
said, "dont move". After about two more minutes, he said "Thx" and ran away.
After a short while, I realized why he'd asked my bearded female dwarf
character in the flimsy chainmail tunic to "dont move" - and had to go
shower to get rid of the dirty feeling.

    Feel free to stick that in the book!!

    James
