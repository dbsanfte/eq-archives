I find there to be quite a noticeable difference between European (AB
and Venril Sathir) and American (FV and Tribunal), in that on the
European servers I see the monster turn towards me and attack before I
reach it, while on the American ones I run up to the monster only to
find it's behind me and has started hitting me already. Admittedly the
difference is fairly trivial, but it's both noticeable and annoying to
me after having played only on VS for a few months.
