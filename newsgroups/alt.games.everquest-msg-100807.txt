Hmmm... how have you avoided starving to death? A can of soup is still a can
of soup... and I'm pretty sure Campbells have raised the price of canned
soup in the last 40-some years... so do you stop buying food cuz the price
keeps going up?

How about electricity? I'm pretty sure the stuff that comes outta the
powersockets in your house is the same kind of stuff your Grandpa used...
and I guess the price of THAT has gone up a whole lot in the past 40 years.

Water?... that stuff falls outta the sky for FREE, for crying out loud...
why should YOU have to pay the water company to pipe it into your home?

Oh... and one last question while you're stunned by the subtlety of my
argument...

Can I have your stuff? :o)
