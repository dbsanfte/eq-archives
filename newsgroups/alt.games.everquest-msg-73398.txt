If you count "oh crap... forgot I had Chords of Dissonance up" or "Sorry,
Lashun Novashire, I didn't really mean to attack you.  I'll just sit here
and let you kill me now, so I don't take a faction hit" as "my own
stupidity," then I feel your pain.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
