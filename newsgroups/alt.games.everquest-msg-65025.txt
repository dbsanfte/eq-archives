In the arithmetic I use, 2001 - 1995 = 6 years.

Still, I have to agree, 6 years is long time for not taking any upgrades.
Especially Win98SE which is one of the best for games.

I'm not certain, but I'll bet you can find a copy of Win98SE for less than
$100.

Personally, I use Win2K, and it's not the greatest for EQ, but it's more
stable compared with Win9x/ME
