Hello,

I'm not having any problems since the update (well not that I didn't have
before anyway... but that's for another thread) but my partner who never had
any problems pre-Dec 3rd now finds that his framerate absolutely stinks.

Pings etc are great, monitor shows 250/400 on average (we're sharing a cable
modem) but it takes him a good 10seconds just to turn round and watching
NPCs move is like you're blinking every other second - they just leap across
the room.

He's on a Trident Blade 3d (aka VIA Apollo MVP4) and built in VIA ac97 sound
both of which worked perfectly before DirectX 8.1, Win98SE, AMD K6 2 500 and
320Mb RAM.

I've put the latest 4-in-1 (4.36) on and the latest VGA and AGP drivers as
well and tried every setting I can think of, both in the BIOS and in the
game itself right down to 640-480 with no lighting, no sound, and Low
textures. Still moves like a really crap robotic breakdancer.

We've got Kunark and Velious but NOT Luclin and every other 3D game we have
between us works fine. Unfortunately we're not addicted to any of the other
games!

Any and all suggestions welcome, especially if you've had the same problem
and don't any more.

Ta,

Calmac.
