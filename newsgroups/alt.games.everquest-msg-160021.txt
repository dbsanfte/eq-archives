I think it works similar to critical hits similar to those warrors get.  As
I currently stand with DEX=105 I get criticals and procs rather
innfrequently (maybe one or two times per fight).  I notice if a get turned
into a werewolf via enchanter spell, my DEX=205, and I start proc-ing and
crit-ing like 2-3 times more frequently (so 2-6 times if not more).

I think the crit/proc system is more simple then we give it credit for.  I
have noticed that EQ may have a more complicated combat system than PnP
games, but in the interest in computing power the underlying structure must
still be far less complicated.

Just last night my wep double-proc'd, so back to back procs in a very small
amount of time (say <1 sec).  The weapon was Felhammer, and I have been
using it for sometime now, and have never seen it do that until last night.
