Remember it well. In my case I would see myself sliding along the deck 
and all the others on the boat disappear until the screen froze. If I 
was lucky I zoned, if not I crashed. Though on one memorable occasion I 
was in the cabin at the back and I slid out the back of the boat as it 
zoned. That was an interesting swim that gained me 20 in swim before I 
made land. Luckily guild members told me which way to swim. After that I 
went to EQatlas and got the map.

I stopped the problem when someone suggested turning on texture caching. 
I zoned much faster as a result. Never had a problem on the boat from 
zoning again.

But I also remember the day the boat rammed the customs house in 
Freeport. That was funny disembarking from the boat by walking down the 
stairs in the custom house, Wish I had known I could have got a 
screenshot by pressing 'minus' at the time.
