You make a very valid point.   I mentioned the media/entertainment
industries, but the whole socio-economic power difference does often
chafe.  On the purely political front, however (if you can validly
separate politics from economics and military might) Canada has become
more influential than ever thanks both to our increased visibility
(such as hosting G7/8 summits) and the USA's tarnished world image.
It is rather amusing to see other nations approaching Canada as a
"middle-man" in relations with the US.
