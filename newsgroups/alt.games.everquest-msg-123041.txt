Ironically....
I went back to Geos last night.  I have been there for many hours, and have
previously only had the problem I mentioned earlier.

me  /ooc Camp check

Chanter  /Geos, but, we are leaving in a few minutes, 20 the most.

/tell chanter Cool, working on getting group together.  If u see us at
bottom, no worries, will wait the 20 for ya.

Chanter /Ok, good.  Going to do one, maybe 2 more runs, and will be out of
here.

Time goes by....friends come from around norrath, we all meet at the bottom,
took maybe 30 to 40 minutes all told.

/tell chanter You folks almost done?  Group is set here.

Chanter /no, Im going to stay till I ding.  Partner went to town to sell ten
minutes ago...should be back soon.  Should ding in one more run.

10 minutes goes by, and I notice that geos popped all over....but she isnt
killing.  (takes maybe 10 minutes tops to sell.

/tell chanter Where did partner go?  Would you like to join us?  We have a
spot open.

Chanter /this is my camp.  Wait till Im done.

/tell chanter Not trying to be difficult, but, right now a total of 5 people
are waiting on ya.  You originally said 20 minutes...shit happens, but, its
now over an hour.  We are simply going on what you origianlly said.....and
umm, your not doing any killing.

chanter /my camp.  wait till Im finished, or get lost.

/tell chanter tell ya what, we take the bottom 4, you take the top....or
join us.  thatll keep us busy, you can ding, we all then be happy.  The
partner with you is not even in zone anymore.

chanter /go kill terrors or spiders.

/tell chanter both are camped, and umm, not to sound silly....but, not only
are they camped, they are actually killing them.

chanter /it is MY CAMP.  GET THE HELL OUT OF THE TUNNELS.

Talk with group.  They say to give her the top *6*, we take bottom
two....and maybe she will shut up.

chanter /you get none.  Either leave, or I get guild here.

No, in the meantime, we kill bottom two.  /shouts we are ks'ing.  The zone
kinda laughed at her, as most in cc seemed to know me from groups.  Now, a
focus gem pops at number 2 spot.

/tell chanter to make life easier, avoid issues....its yours.  we will just
take the next one up.

chanter /I cant kill them.  will ruin my faction.  my friend is doing all
the killing and Im looting, so, go kill it, Ill just loot the gem.

/tell chanter Ok, this is getting silly.   We get bottom 4...and we will
kill them, you get top and can continue to watch them.  Problem with that,
either a-suck up and deal, b-get a GM, or C-have a nice day.

Chanter shouts that I am a cocksucking asshole.

We kill bottom 4 3 times....she never touches the top 4.

Finally we go all the way up....she is parked next to a focus geo on top.
Tells us to let her loot it.  Group response...../rofl.  We kill, loot.

Go back down.
she runs by....and then runs back up again.  With a train of spiders and
terrors in tow.  We kill train.  Dont hear anymore from her.

10 minutes later....we hear her shouting for a tele to West Commons.   5
minutes later....a druid does a shout that he tele'd her, for free.   He
then shouts that being she was such an ass in the zone, he took her to
Iceclad....and disbanded her there.  He left as a snow derv was eating her.
The zone cheered him.

Oh well.  Sorry so long, but, hey, I cant log in....think the servers are
down, and well, Im bored.
