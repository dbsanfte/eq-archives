Chef.  And he was L59.  At the time this happened we hadn't yet managed
to get all the mobs we were killing cleared at once, and I think he had
the misfortune to get two unexpected adds (including the Enchanter) on
the pull.

For most of the night there were only two or three responses to each
"camp check" (excluding the exit mobs).  There was a Trak raid going
on, and that seemed to be consuming most of the people in the zone.

Often?  Unless there's no Cleric in the zone, and no guidie with a
49+ Cleric on-line, and the healer is a Druid or Shaman, and we can
win the fight without the healer, and I actively dislike the healer,
it's <always> better for me to die than the healer.  Hell, it's
usually better for me to die than the Warrior, or the Monk, or, if
I'm not too badly lagged to react fast enough, the Ranger.  FWIW,
I was embarrassed by the only death we had camping chef, the MA was
dropped by a Wiz chain casting big nukes.  I couldn't do anything
about it, was lagged just enough that his HP bar started dropping
from 60% about half-a-second before the nuke that killed him landed
(BOOM!  You're Dead!).  I assume it was a pair of Ice Comets that
dropped him (could check log for messages I guess) as I can't think
of another nuke that could take a 59 Ogre Warrior with ca. 1200hp
worth of buffs from 60% to dead in two casts.

Well, most was a guess based on experiences in CoM.  Should have said
some instead of most.  Instead I'll just withdraw the statement as
ill-considered in light of lack of evidence.

The named phantom-types in CoM that I've fought all give the message
"This spell only works on the undead" when Instrument of Nife procs.

Well I do pull, when I can or must, but usually there's a better choice
(MA worked out well in Seb, for instance).

Well, perfect is in the eye of the perfectionist.  But even in an
"imperfect" group, I've found that I am usually more effective as
the second banana than as the MT.  My gear is ok, but it sure seems
like whenever I'm MT I get comments about how much more healing it
took for me than for yet_another_really_irritating_250k_twink_07,
while I get either (apparently) approving silence or compliments
when I'm the OffTank/CrowdControlHelp/CasterSilencer/PanicHealer.

Ah yes, the elusive "nice easy relaxing" kill-or-be-killed melee.  lol.
I've found it pretty easy to let a Warrior have the agro, except when
having to chain stun casters.  Sometimes lag prevents "begins to cast"
messages and "interrupted" messages (from Bash) from showing in a timely
manner, so you just have to keep stunning to prevent a Gate or (when
several people are down hp) potentially lethal nuke.  But then who cares
which way a stunned mob is facing (well, besides the Rogue who's already
opposite me)?  Honestly tho, I am looking forward to the day that I have
to take care not to pull agro off a Warrior.  Right now I can take and
hold agro if I want it, but unless the Warrior is working a 2H weapon
skill up from very lo it is rare that a mob turns on me and the Warrior
can always take it back quickly, so far at least.
