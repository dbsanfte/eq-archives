    They don't need the drops. They're all pretty much in full elemental
armour, which beats ornate by a country mile. They did it because their
guild leader lives off the money he makes selling plat on Playerauctions,
and the molds sell for 30 K plus. Or at least they did before a million all
hit the Bazaar at once.

    I agree totally. I always thought that the named mobs in the Tier III
zones should have a chance of dropping ornate molds. So, as an example,
you'd get an ornate mold off Galremos, the big mudman in Sol Ro's Tower that
slowly splits into smaller pieces as you kill him. Or off the named mobs
that pop in the different wings in BoT.

    Right now, ornate molds are dropping off almost any mob in Sol Ro's
Tower.

    The funny part is, the people farming it don't really need it. Other
than BPs and leggings, they're all pretty much set for armour. And BPs
aren't dropping from trash mobs. The people buying this stuff are mostly
people whose guilds haven't cleared to Tier III yet. In other words, the
only people that want it are people that couldn't farm it themselves.
