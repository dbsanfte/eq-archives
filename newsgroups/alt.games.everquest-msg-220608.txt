Well, I took about an 8 month absence while I was beta-testing and playing
Star Wars Galaxies. Had a good time, but the game ran out of gas after a
while and LDoN looked pretty interesting, so I'm back!

I went on my first LDoN adventure last night and had a blast. Six of us took
a Normal Collections out of the Mistmoore theme and I earned a cool 6 pts
(picked up a Wis charm for my Shammy), leveled to 43 and my share of the
loot (I was ML) was 55pp. Not a bad 90 minutes!

Couple of re-orientation questions:

1) I tried making an /assist macro mostly to be able to target Slows, DoTs,
etc, but every time I hit the button I wound up in attack mode. I seem to
recall from playing before that there's a way to /assist without launching
attack? Can anyone remind me how to set this up?

2) Anything I should know about Shaman that has changed or improved since I
last looked at it (around the time LoY released)? Has the Alchemy skill
actually become useful? Since I gained a level last night I can improve my
Alchemy another 5 pts, but when I left it really wasn't all that great a
tradeskill. I'm hoping it's improved some?

BTW, I LOVE the new spell gem loading sets! It's not really practical to
load full sets, but I've found it quite useful for setting up a basic gem
set and making slight alterations for like 2 or 3 gems. These can load
quickly on the fly and are very handy to use.

Anything else I should know about changes in the last 6-8 months?

I'll start visiting my favorite fan sites again (I still have my allakhazam
account) for more info, but would appreciate any insights from this august
group!

Thanks,
