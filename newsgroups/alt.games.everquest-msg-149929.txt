Just as an experiment, you could cast bolt and as soon as the spell
hits, starting running backward (maybe with SoW) till your invis spell
gem pops, and then
stand still for 1 second and cast it.  That might give you the wee bit
of
extra time you need.

On the other hand, I think once you're on the mob's hate list, it can
see you
even though you are invis.  I know this is true with my bard, that I
can run
like hell away from a mob *while casting invis* and the mob will still
chase
even though the invis has taken hold.
