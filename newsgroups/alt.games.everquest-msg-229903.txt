From the shadows, the mysterious Darkensolo <kasten@pobox.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>"More prevalant than it is here" != all top posting or whatever it was
>you wanted to prove.  There's not a whole lot of top posting here.
>His additional qualifiers to that statement don't much help your cause
>either.

He's more or less hopeless. Utterly closeminded, and totally
impervious to logic. He wouldn't know a cognative argument if it bit
him on the ass. That's why he desperately grabs at any statement that
een remotely seems to support anything he said.
