Being in a guild that is indeed quite proud of our accomplishments, as 
minor as they may seem to uber guilds, I do agree with you on this point.    
On the other hand, not having to repeat all of those flagging mobs in 
order to get new guild members up to a point of being able to raid with 
us is a blessing.  We have done all those flagging mobs many times, we 
know we can beat them, doing them yet again and again and again would 
likely destroy the guild as the people who are already flagged, and will 
get zero upgrades from the reflagging process get bored with it and move 
on.

On the other hand, the elemental alternate flagging is accomplished by 
defeating the elemental god of the plane in question, and as such, cannot 
be done by a small group and gimp a whole guild in.  I don't honestly 
know what the alternate flagging is for the pre elemental zones.  The 
only way you could gimp a guild into being elemental flagged would be to 
essentially bring the entire guild (or most of it anyway) along on a raid 
on the elemental god.  Not something that a small group of friends can 
accomplish.  Elemental flagged people can gimp a friend into the 
elemental plane with them to xp there, but they cannot flag that friend 
in that manner, unless there is another alternate method for elemental 
flagging that I am unaware of.

Is there a single group method of getting elemental flagged now?
