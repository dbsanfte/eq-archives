Well, after a VERY LONG absense from the game, I finally got Luclin a
try.  BUT I died.

I just recently found out about Luclins airless zones the very hard
way. =(
Now I have a question.

Is it possible to get a res in this zone?

I mean, I don't have any EB items, but I do have EB spell.  Res
effects wipes out all your buffs, if I remember correctly.  So... what
happens?

If you get a res, you start with 1HP and wouldn't you just die
instantly again?

I'm currently camped out, but I'm wondering just what happens at this
point.

Maybe I'm asking something that doesn't completely mean anything in
the game, since it has been well over a year since I played, nearly
Velious times!  I was quite impressed with the new graphics and
especially the NewUI as well.  =)

Thanks for reading this post, since it's probably an easy response for
anyone who's played here at all. =)
