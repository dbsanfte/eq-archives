If you want an in-game justification, I actually refer to my alts as
my main's children. The fact that he's an Iksar and some of them are
Dark Elves has been explained to them as such:

"Your mother, Cazic rend her soul,  was a Tier'Dal enchanter. I'm an
Iksar necromancer. It's probably better not to ask which of us made
things possible."
