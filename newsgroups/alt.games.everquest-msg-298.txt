That I can understand, I just wonder why there is no automatic 'reset'
mechanism to pulll them back to their spawn points. Everything else in
the game either wanders around the zone along established paths or
goes back to their starting positions after a certain amount of
post-battle time. Why does this merchant (and apparently others) not
go back?
