The FM bind spot is a hellish disaster waiting to happen if you're of
the level to be worried by mobs in that zone, tantamount to the Wiz
portal in Skyfire for higher levels.  FM melee bind point is bad
m'kay?  The DLs Druid ring however is one of the safest points in all
of Kunark, in the unlikely event of anything being trained there only
Gorenaire or that feisty Monk NPC is going to have a life expectancy
over five seconds.

Bazaar is a handy place to bind if you have Luclin, if no SoL then FV
is a sound choice.
