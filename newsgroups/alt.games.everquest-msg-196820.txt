Really?  I like:

1) charm caster
2) target other mob
3) /pet attack

This has several advantages.

1: caster mobs tend to be overpowered as casters, with lots of mana and excellent channeling skills, their
spells can devastate the target mob.
2: while their mana pools are deep indeed, they are not limitless.  Run them out of mana and you tend to have
melee mobs with low HP totals.
3: get several mobs swarming the caster pet and its HP drop quick, drop charm and its an easy kill since its
running (hopefully, assuming you've timed it right)
4: charm works as a great interrupt.  When charm breaks on your melee mob, the caster targets you and starts
casting.  Even if you can get the melee mob back on him, you are going to be eating that spell, possibly
several spells, before the switch back to the melee mob takes place.  With the caster pet, though, charm
drops, he starts to cast on me, I recharm and while he finishes his cast, I'm "protected" from the effect by
the PVP rules!

You can also chain cast mez.  Every time mez lands it interrupts casting.  Chain mezzing (and I don't mean
turn it on leave it on, but rather start stop start stop chaining) will interrupt a cast up to once every 3
seconds.  Mez is broken only when its next hit, so there will be a delay there before the next possible start
of a spell; spells over 3 seconds in cast time never get thru, but even ones shorter than that often suffer
from a delayed start and still get interrupted on the cycle.
