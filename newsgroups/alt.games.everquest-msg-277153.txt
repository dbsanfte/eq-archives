I soloed that run for the betrayal quite easily.  Just follow the path
and don't stop at all for any reason.  You need to watch what's coming
up and go slightly off the path as necessary.

The quest is not soloable at all as you need to kill 6 group++ mobs and
I think that they all con blue or above.  You can't even just level up
until they are green or grey as you're prevented from leveling past 17
until it's complete.
