I'm surprised I haven't seen this here yet, but perhaps that is
because a newsgroup and graphical images don't mix well.  Many of you will
have seen this already at another major EQ board (I know GU comics is
one, and I heard about The Safehouse and Graffes)

First of all, please visit this link and take a look at the "Spoof the
Goofs" news item:

	www.cynosureguild.org

I don't know who this guild is, and I don't particularly care.  Heck, some
folks on a.g.e might be in Cynosure.  What I do understand is that they
are not only practicing copyright infringement of a fellow EQ player (woo,
copyright infringement...but yes, hold that thought), but that they are
holding a contest (with an in game prize) to see who can come up with the
most creative and insulting mockery of this one woman's fan art.  And not
because she did anything to offend them.

This started when one of their members used her art for their sig, without
her permissions. When the artest (known as Amulett) requested they stop,
this person complied without fuss, and apologized.  However, a member of
that person's guild took grief over this and start to rip off Amulett's
art further.  Then the entire guild got involved in a sort of sick game of
"lynch the artist". 

Anyhow, knee jerk reaction on my part...I find this to be a pretty low
act.  I greatly enjoy EQ fan art, and the last thing I want is for the
artists to close up shop because they can't share their work without
having it stolen from them. :(  (And many artists sympathetic to her are
starting to do just that.)

And in EQ when something bad happens, you don't go to Big Daddy...you
instead just spread the news around.  So, ahem, that's all.
