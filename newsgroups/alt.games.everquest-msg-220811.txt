But I bet you didn't crawl sebilis back when it was the most camped
dungeon in the world <g>. Hell, you could walk from zone in to Jugs
without ever seeing a mob up. Not that I disagree with your premise
but Seb is a bad example. There have always been dungeons you could
crawl if you knew where to look. The Hole is probably the best example
for a higher end (pre-PoP) dungeon but Siren's Grotto and Dragon
Necropolis also spring to mind as fun 'crawling' dungeons.

I think it was imposed but there were different pressures. Population
pressures and the fact that named spawns weren't random did much to
train players to 'camp' instead of crawling.

Agreed but I'm not sure how they could've done it differently  given
that they wanted the time limit to keep down the number of instances.
I'm hoping that they can take the lessons learned in LDoN and apply
them to future expansions. 

Plus there are nice things about LDoN, much as I disliked the concept
when I first heard it the time pressure does add a sense of urgency.
It's not nearly as bad as I first thought and winning an adventure
with just a few minutes left can be a lot of fun. ... and it leaves a
lot more dungeons empty for those that do like to crawl <g>.

I'd argue that they have actually come out with some excellent
dungeons lately. LoY has it's flaws but those are mainly related to
risk versus reward and the fact that the dungeons were too low level
to make them interesting for a large percentage of the players.
Overall though, I think most of those zones are well designed. The
same goes for other dungeons they've added recently, places like
Veksar and ChardokB, both of which are fun dungeons to 'crawl'
through. They did miss the mark with SolC.
