I encountered this error a lot at one ime but have not had it for a while. I
found that if I went to windows andwhilst connected to the net I ran
winipcfg and clicked release all and then renew all, after a while an error
regarding DHCP will flag up, cancel that and then try EQ again. Worked for
me and a few others and is just a bizarre last shot of a fix
