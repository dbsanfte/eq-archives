Do you care what happens to your faction in WFP and EFP?  If not, try and
get in on a Lucan kill or two.  The faction boost is very nice for NFP.  You
will be KOS in both WFP and EFP quite quickly.  My barbarian shaman helped
kill Lucan once, and then killed 2 guards in WFP, at which point faction was
bottomed out with the Militia.  At that point he was amiable to the
paladins.
