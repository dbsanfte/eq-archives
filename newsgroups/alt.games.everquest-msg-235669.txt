Paladins of Norrath @ EZBoard is an awesome resource.
http://pub148.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath

As a Paladin, you want to fight undead whenever possible.  Your spells are DD against
undead.  You also should always fight in dungeons, to take advantage of the Zone
Experience Modifier found in every dungeon.

For soloing, see if you can get to the entrance of LGuk.  If you can hold your against the
lower-level undead croakies, the ZEM will serve you well. DING DING DING

Also try the Unrest CY, but be warned that CRs there are many and lengthy.

Stay the hell out of PC, less the newb-think there corrupt another good player.  Ack.

IMO your biggest need at this level is insta-cast SoW, ie - JBoots.  Wearing them, you can
run away from almost anything that gets the better of you.

Best regards,
