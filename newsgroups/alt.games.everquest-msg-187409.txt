Well... I use Win2k at work and XP at home, and on the whole, I tend to 
prefer XP. If anything, being the "consumer" version, it seems more 
aware of consumer-level hardware, and it does have a few time-saving 
wizards and features that are lacking in W2k. I haven't really had any 
EQ-related problems with XP, and as far as 98 goes, even if it does work 
well now, I generally think that getting a five-year old OS for a new 
computer is a bad idea.

On the other hand, you could always get a Mac. You'd be restricted to an 
exclusive Mac server (no transfers), and I think the Mac version does 
not include PoP, but you'll get a much better (not faster, better) 
computer for your money. :)
