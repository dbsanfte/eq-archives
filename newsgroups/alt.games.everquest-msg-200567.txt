	The numbers have gotten bigger.  That does not mean that the game has
gotten harder.  The increased experience far outweighs the increased health
and damage of the mobs -- an hour grinding AAs at 65 in the planes produces
far, far more than an hour grinding AAs at 60 in terrestrial zones ever did.

	That number can't be right; I think maybe you mean 1300 AC.  I'm only 63
and I have just over 3K HP self-buffed.

|You don't get to his level if you tire of this sort of thing.

	They will.  Everyone does.

	Sooner or later, people in the munchkin guilds must be put into a position
wherein they will have to accept that they've won the game and have to either
start over or move on.  The best thing that could happen to EQ would be for
everyone in FoH, Afterlife and similar guilds to cancel their accounts.
