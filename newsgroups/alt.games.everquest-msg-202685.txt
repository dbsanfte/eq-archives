*chuckle*  Nobody's ramming EQ down your throat.  Nobody's forcing you 
to play it.

If you're this upset with the change to the game -- and I assume that 
you must be, since you've made quite a few posts already -- then vote 
with your wallet.  Or do as someone else suggested and write SOE a 
letter.  Not an e-mail, a _letter_.  Paper missives still, I believe, 
get more attention than electronic ones.

Me, I don't care.  I play a monk.  No mana, no KEI.  Doesn't bother me 
either way.
