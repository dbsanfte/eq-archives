I'm not dissing AC here, I haven't played it and so I'm not qualified to
pass judgement, but given who Turbine's backers are, I think it's not
unlikely that they would keep the game going even with a total
population at peak time of half a dozen people. Considering the pissing
contest between Microsoft and Sony, I don't think MS would allow
themselves to be perceived as having lost it badly.
