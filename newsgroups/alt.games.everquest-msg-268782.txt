I virtually soloed my PAL from 0-58.  I'm not anti-social, I just play at 4-8 GMT, which
is not conducive for a midwest server.

As my PAL approaches 60, his ability to technically solo XP-giving MOBs is as strong as
ever.  His ability to root-heal or stun-heal, combined with the LoY fast-heals and HoTs,
keeps him victorious against all but the toughest high-blue MOBs.

HOWEVER - the downtime for heals and mana regen is a real downer.  I now much prefer to be
in a rockin' GE or Veksar group.

Best regards,
