The bear cave in Nedaria's Landing. All pelts dropped there will be at least
low quality.

And, if you are desperate, there's a quest in Gukta who will take 3 quality
pelts and hand you back one pelt of the next quality up, so:
9 LQ : 3 MQ : 1HQ.


Although it's usually better to sell the LQ & MQ in the bazaar for cash and
buy the HQ ones. =)
