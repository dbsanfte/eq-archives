I've seen the arguments for getting a Tinkerer's Bag, and I'm not sure
they are right.  If you solo a lot, or group in a lot of groups where
you are the beefiest person and everyone else is wimpy casters, or most
of your groups are pickup groups where you don't trust the other group
members, then get the bag.

However, if you group with people you can trust somewhat, and there are
other non-casters in the group, why not let them carry the loot for you
until the group splits up?  Also, with the recent patch that made
summoned items survive link death, summoned containers from mages and
shaman are pretty safe.  Get a couple of those at the start of a play
session.

I'd seriously consider going for Traveller's Boots instead of the
Tinkerer's Bag.
