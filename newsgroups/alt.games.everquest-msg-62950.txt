AH ok read previous post, yeah Hushed does not violate policy in and
of itself. So player could get the last name changed if it was say
"whisper" "yomouf" or really with the new policy just if they felt

They don't like to change the first name unless it clearly violates
policy because its a way to escape your reputation.
