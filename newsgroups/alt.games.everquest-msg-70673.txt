The one thing overlooked here is the number of people who don't buy
the upgrade at all, but rather 'borrow' it from others. And
considering the number of O/Ss since Win95 was released, there's no

Software theft is just that, but in any reasoned debate on the subject
of operating system upgrades, we can't ignore that it does, indeed,
happen.
