    The mob has slow mitigation, which is supposed to be working but isn't
right now.

    What Verant thought they coded: all slow spells are reduced in slow
percentage by a certain amount, so Turgur's (for example) isn't a 75% slow
but a number lower than 75%. Idea being that mobs are still slowable, better
slows are still better, but slow isn't the complete gimping that it normally
is (and the mob doesn't need crazy unslowed damage output to make it
reasonable when slowed).

    What they actually coded: all slows above a certain % simply fail to do
anything. They give you the message that they land, but they don't change
the attack speed of the mob. Using lower ability slows, like a BST slow or a
lower-level SHM/ENC slow, does work and is what you need to do.

    This is a known issue, and will hopefully be fixed next patch. Until
then, have your slower have a second slowdown spell of about 50% slow
available to use for the final guy.
