TBoots, which as far as I know requires faction with the gnomes in
there...which requires the Necro to kill Kobolds in SolB.  Better off
buying a JBoots MQ.  Better than either of these though?  Just buy
about 10 SoW potions.  This will likely take you well in to your 50s. 
At the worst, 20 SoW potions.  Then you just get run3.  You're almost
certainly gonna spend 99% of your kiting time outdoors anyway.  You'll
save money, SoW is faster, and any left over that you dont need can be
traded.

Ring of the Solstice isnt bad, usually around 5k.

Good idea for BA/AE as well as extended range and mana preservation. 
Black Alloy Medallion is around 500 plat I believe, or it can be
farmed very easily in Runnyeye.  That's Mana Pres II.  I'm not sure
about extended range items sold cheap...but it sure is nice when you
are trying to snare a mob that is chasing you.  Any spell haste is
also good, for this if for nothing else.

Also think about buying some Stalking Probes.  They should cost around
30 plat each and cast 5 charges of EoZ...great for healing yourself
without attacking anything.  And when you are done, you can sell the
Probe to a vendor for 15 plat.  I got lucky and found a whole pot load
of them for 15 each in the bazaar...meaning they essentially cost me
nothing.

Finally as for regen...That cloak the are talking about is the only
thing I know of for cheap however there is a LoY quest you can do for
a +1 regen ring.  As long as you have a high-level main and a few
friends to help you kill a mediocre SK skeleton in Tox, the quest is
easy.  The rest should take you a few hours unless your luck on drops
fails you in Nadox.  I dont know if it is level restricted though--I
got it for my Necro in his 50s.
