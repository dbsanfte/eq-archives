Oh... I thought you said you had.  Maybe I should look into signing up
for a remedial reading class or something.

Nope.  Which I suppose has an upside... I prevents the Lone Gun psychos
from farming greens all day long, they have to at least have a second
account or a partner.  In answer to Kaev's question, I do believe that
/raid does work as a complete get-around.  I know that Lenny and I, both
38, we're able to get magic drops off of Evil Eyes, when those were
green to us at 30.  I also know of a L50+ who was able to farm Sarnak
Braids by going into /raid.  AFAIK, a level 65 could /raid with a level
1 mule, and farm plague rat tails (which drop off of normal rats too,
btw, not just plague rats) if they were of a mind too.
   
    Personally, I agree with Kaev that it would be just as well to have
a normal rules server, with a 1 character limit on it.

  Just do a /who all teap, /who all lent to see if I am on.  Or send a
"Hiya" in serverwide.age:age.  I have it on autojoin.
