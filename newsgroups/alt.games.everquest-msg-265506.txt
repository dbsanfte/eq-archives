Exactly - There's so much more to be done/expanded/added to CoH that the 
devs can spend their time a lot more productively than creating new code 
to deal with mob "ownership".

I'd much rather see new powers, customizable powers and new content than 
some fandangled system that guarantees 'ownership' of mobs. (Not to 
mention that any such system would be completely unrealistic and ruin the 
suspension of disbelief)

Same here - And I've tried to pay it forward, as well, by doing drive-by 
healings and drive-by Ice Slicks, for lower level chars having trouble. 

I started a new scrapper last night, just for the fun of it, and some 
twit was running around killing as much as he could with absolutely no 
regard to who was fighting what - Annoying and rude, yes, but I moved to 
a different area of the city and the problem went away. 

I'm in the game to play, not to keep a log/file reports on each and every 
twit I run across - I have to do that enough in real life (server 
administrator). I do, however, know that when I ask a group of people if 
they need a controller/blaster/scrapper/tank/defender/whatever I'm 
playing that day, I'm accepted almost always - these little twerps who 
don't give a damn about the rest of the playerbase don't have nearly as 
much luck.
