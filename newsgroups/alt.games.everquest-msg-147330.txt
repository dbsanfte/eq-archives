I once had an ICQ number that only had six digits.

I remember when "Gopher" was the hot new menu front end that made accessing
Internet databases easier for the novice user.

I remember when "zmodem" was the hot new protocol which made downloads on my
new 2400 baud modem really fly. (The surname of my EQ main on the Saryrn
server is "Xmodem").

I still use my initials all lowercase as my login wherever I can, reflecting
the convention of the era during which I first went online.


P.S. And if you visit www.chinet.com and log into the "CBBS" forum system
there and post this question, you will get responses that make me look like
a generation-Y l33t dewd....
