When have you ever actually seen that to happen?  It never happens.  The
chat room never did anyone any good, so naturally the complainers took it
over and made it into a blow off steam room.  That is the only purpose the
room serves.

That may be what the original idea was, but the fact remains that when asked
for advice 99.999% of the time they offer no help.  The purpose of a thing
is not what someone thought it would be used for but what it *is* used for.
