From stress testing WoW over the weekend, it looked to me like a lot of the
playerbase was from EQLive, at least on the evil side.  We sat around Brill
Saturday evening talking about what servers we played on, comparing guilds
and encounters, and so forth.

There were a few SOE bashers, but by and large the sentiment among those of
us "Vital Sign Challenged" (i.e., Undead) players was that we were going to
try both WoW and EQ2, then pick between the three (including EQLive).

There weren't any CoH players in the conversation, which I thought was
interesting.  My guess is that those folks are happy where they're at.

CoH was okay for what it was, but the superhero genre isn't really my thing.
I will admit, thought, that the closest I've come to firing my CoH account
back up was yesterday afternoon when I walked out of "The Incredibles" with
the kids ... ;-)
