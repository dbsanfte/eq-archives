 I think that they should lower the chance considerably of spells being
resisted by mobs higher than you. This allows a wizard to solo effectively
by gaining more experience. (Kill a red mob then med for 10 minutes, as
opposed to kill a blue mob and med for 10 minutes).

Does anyone have any other ideas on how to make this class lose its bad
reputation?
