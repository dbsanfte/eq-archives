Hi there,

Currently I have a Celeron 766 with 256mb of RAM with an onboard 32MB AGP
graphics chipset.
I'm running EQ with PoP installed.
It's a tad slow running under winXP with lots of apps installed but I have a
dual boot system with a bare bones 98 installation (patched of course with
latest drivers and DirectX etc) to run EQ on and it makes it much faster!!

I have just bought the EQ gold pack with SoL, SoV & RoK in it.
Which of these should I install?  I'm a lvl 23 Bard Half Elf half Human.

I would like to install as much as I can without it affecting the PC
performance too much.....

I believe SoL has newer graphics that update all the old ones and it may
make my PC too slow..... is this correct?
If I install it and decide it's too slow can I go back to the previous
graphics?
Pls advise.

Ta,

T.
