I'm assuming you're going by the map provided by Eqatlas.com?  Coming out of
the necro guild area, you just keep to the right until you hit teleport C.
Avoid Teleport B, which is what was taking you to the observatory and
palace.

Also, try using the Find button and uncheck the box that says show only
destinations I can use.  Then try to find one of the ShadowKnight
guildmasters or spell merchants.  The Shadowknight guild is directly across
from the gates where you want to head.  Go through the gates and turn left
into the building.  Come to think of it, there is a soulbinder in this
building you can search for as well.  Pass the guard and the soulbinder and
you will see a rock at the end.  Use your key on the rock to bring down the
elevator.
