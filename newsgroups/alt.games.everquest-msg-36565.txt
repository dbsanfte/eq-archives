Take the time you are medding to load up an evac (although you should have
had it loaded anyway) and be ready to get everyone the hell out of there if
necessary (that assumes you are of a level to have some evacs, of course).

Note that even though nukes are reistsed, they still cause aggro (not sure
how much). So, if you are of a particularly brave/suicidal bent, if
everything is going all to hell and the cleric is getting beaten to death
(and for some reason you can't evac), you can always chain cast on the mob
to get it off the cleric so they can run/camp. You'll probably die, but at
least CR will be easier with the cleric still alive...

After 34 (or is it 39?) you get O'Kiel Flickering Flame, which has a longer
duration and higher (but still sucky) damage. The main difference is that it
stacks with most anything, whereas the lower level one doesn't seem to for
some reason.
