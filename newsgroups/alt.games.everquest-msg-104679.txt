 Seldom is a raid actually scheduled anymore for us. There's simply too
much competition to try and schedule something. We basically have people

 Either there are another 3 seahorses I'm not familiar with or they just
don't like monks. I can't remember the last time they didn't aggro on
me. And from behind they seem to have a very good stun ratio.
