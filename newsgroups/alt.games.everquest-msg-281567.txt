*** Headliners ***


*** New Default UI Skin ***

- We have updated the default UI skin with new art and icons! This is the 
same artwork that has been on display on our Escape to Norrath server 
(www.escapetonorrath.com) and our test server. For those of you that prefer 
to use the old default UI Skin, you can type /loadskin default_old in your 
chat window and it will allow you to use the old default UI.


*** Events and Seasonal Festivities ***

- Zigan Ribshard in the Plane of Knowledge has a few friends he'd like you 
to meet. Speak with him for more information regarding seasonal festivities.


Community Summit Related Items:

- There is a new filter option on the guild bank to narrow your search.
- Added a "guildbank" argument to /outputfile, allowing a player to dump the 
guild bank to disk. NOTE: This can only be used in the Guild Hall.
- Players should now be able to withdraw items from the Guild Bank deposit 
area (if they're a Guild Banker).
- Added Stun and Strikethrough filters/color selectors.
- Players now have an option in the options window to determine whether or 
not they want other players to see them with their helm. "Show My Helm"
- EverQuest now uses the system mouse. While in windowed mode you can freely 
move the mouse around as you can with any other application running in a 
window.
Mouse pointer customization can be done on a UISkin level. Just make your 
own .cur files with the appropriate names. (Please see the default directory 
for the .cur names.)
- There's a new command to launch a web browser from the chat window. Just 
type /www and check it out. Also for additional flexibility, /url is 
available.
- There's a new command to launch an application. Check out /system for 
usage.


New arena zone headed to Stormhammer!

- Please be aware that if you login to Stormhammer and download the new 
arena.eqg, that file will need to be deleted if you want to login to a 
server other than Stormhammer. This file is located in your EverQuest root 
directory.

- Raid invites can now be done across zones via "/raidinvite name"
- Bandaging other players will appear to give a healing effect again.


*** Audio Triggers ***

Audio triggers are sound effects that are played when certain patterns 
appear in the chat window. You can make audio triggers to play any sound you 
want when something you want to be sure not to miss appears in the chat 
window. This might be /tells from specific friends, certain buffs fading, or 
any other event you can think of that has a text message associated with it. 
The window used to configure your Audio Triggers can be accessed via the EQ 
button -> Actions -> Audio Triggers.

There are a couple key ideas that make up Audio Triggers.

Audio Triggers are a collection of text patterns associated with a sound 
effect. The window shows a list of all active audio triggers. They are 
sorted by priority so that the first pattern that matches text in the chat 
window will be the one and only sound that is played. This allows patterns 
to be made, for example, "tells you" and "yourbuddy tells you" that may have 
different sound effects. The "Move Up" and "Move Down" commands allow you to 
control which patterns will be tested first.

Creating a new trigger is a simple matter of typing text in the "Pattern" 
field, selecting a sound in the "Sound" control, and pressing "Create".

The other controls include:

* Apply - changes the sound selected for the current pattern. Note that 
changing a pattern requires a new pattern to be made.
* Play - plays the currently selected sound again.
* Delete - delete the currently selected trigger.

Trigger Sets

Trigger Sets are similar to choosing a UI skin. Each trigger set represents 
a set of patterns associated with sounds that is stored on a per-character 
basis. You can switch trigger sets by selecting the drop-down control and 
selecting among the listed options. Unless you have installed custom Audio 
Trigger sets, you will only see the "default" entry.

Each trigger set is stored as a folder in the AudioTrigger folder in your 
EverQuest directory which can contain .wav files unique to that trigger set. 
The goal here is to provide a way for the player community to create and 
share their own Audio Trigger sets that people find useful for different 
classes or play styles, much like they have done for custom UI skins.

An example of a useful trigger set may be a set of patterns
There are many possibilities. Due to the differences in play styles, there 
is no way to predict what settings people might prefer so the default 
settings are empty. We encourage players to discover and share ways to make 
this a fun part of their gameplay.

Notes on customizing Audio Triggers:

* Any .wav files found in the folder .\AudioTriggers\shared will be made 
available to all Audio Trigger sets in the Sound selection control. You will 
probably want to put most of your custom sounds in this folder, unless you 
are making custom Audio Trigger sets.
* Creating a new Audio Trigger set is similar to making a new UI skin. It's 
not complicated but it's not built into the UI. Create a folder in 
.\AudioTriggers\NewTriggerSetName and put any .wav files specific to this 
trigger set in there, and you will be able to start using the new trigger 
set the next time the program is started.
* User settings for each Audio Trigger set can be found in 
.\userdata\AT_TriggerSetName_CharacterName_ServerName.ini. You can copy 
these files to other characters as needed. You will probably want to include 
a sample of this if you make an Audio Trigger set that you plan to share 
because this is what contains all the details on each specific trigger 
pattern and sound.

The above instructions are available in-game via the help button on the 
audio triggers window.
