Well I don't think its all that bad, and whether or not he leveled
more than once each year is really immaterial, although the comment
was a bit funny.  Flute pays the money for the account and gets what
is desired outta it.  The fact that some folks can't understand
playing WITHOUT leveling a toon to 60 in 4 days is really sad.  I have
a 34 PAL that I started in 2000.  Yep.  And I play him from time to
time just casually (along with a bunch of others spread across a few
accounts).  And I do have fun with him, just being mediocre.  I group
about as much as I solo.

Hehe the 32 WAR brought back memories of sitting with my leetle dwarf
back against the wall at the "crossroads" building in Butcher,
awaiting the hitpoints to regen.  After narrowly getting away from
that nasty goblin, and having the dwarf guard (Nizel??) there save my
skin, I would chat with folks sitting there with me, doing just about
the same thing.  That was fun and memorable (obviously).

So good on you for doing EQ your way.  Don't worry what others
think...unless they are paying for your subscription!!
