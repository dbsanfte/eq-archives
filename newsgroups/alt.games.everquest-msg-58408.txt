I am a level 6 Erudite enchanter who has been putting 3 pts per level into
jewelling.

I have bought my jeweler's kit and the first 5 bars of silver I could afford
in anticipation of being able to enchant it at  level 8. Got to head to
either Neriak or the gnome city? for the right spell?

I know that I need to practice with cats eye agates. What other basic gems
will I need?

What I really need though is advice on how much I should pay players will to
sell me their gems. The merchants are thieves and I want to practice as
inexpensively as possible.

Can you give me a generic list of fair prices to pay for the basic  (and
advanced if you know) gems.

lastly, I am seeking advice that even if I make some silver cats eye jewelry
is there any market for them? If so, how much should I ask, and where should
I make/sell stuff?

P.S. I am on Solusek Ro if anyone is feeling generous  :-)  Qeynos Hills.
