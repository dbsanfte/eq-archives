250 is the maximum skill level you can have, and with a skill modifier, it 
can be modified up to the cap of 252.  Effectively, once you are at 240 in 
a tradeskill, and have a 5% modifier (geerlock, GM trophy), you reach the 
cap of 252 in that tradeskill.  Beyond that, you can purchase Jewelcrafting 
Mastery AAs, there are 3 levels.  With JCM 3, your chance of failure is 
reduced by 50%.  There are indeed items that remain far from trivial to 
make, even with the highest skill level possible, just the way it is with 
all of the tradeskills.
