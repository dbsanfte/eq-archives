technically, my guild on Bertoxx is open recruiting all the time but we 
don't advertise because we are mainly older players with no patience for 
beggers and KS'ers.  Our active players usually play from 10pm EST to 
whenever they get too tired to play that night, I usually play during 
the day so I'm stuck with soloing most of the time :-( .  The best way 
to get an invite to the guild is to group with a member and impress them 
enough that they want you to join.  What is your character name?  and do 
you have any alts that you play somewhat regularly?  I can tell the 
guildies to look out for you and see if you'd be a good fit.
