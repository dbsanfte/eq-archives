Dark Elves can't be druids, right? Or do I misremember? Maybe they thought
you were using the DE illusion mask. :-)

Actually my arms and legs have plate on, but they never seem to notice that.
Rogues at least aren't a plate class... I do get begged for rezzes, but then
as a cleric I don't mind that much.(*)

(*) Definition of optimism: a cleric shouting in PoN that they were
offering a 90 rez at GY for donations. I dont think I've ever seen a rez
for donation in PoN, and only once in the Planes - a 96.)
