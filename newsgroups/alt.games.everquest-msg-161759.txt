I feel the same way about FPS games on console.  I can't play them.
Too many years of mouse+"asdw" controls makes playing with even the
fantastically designed Playstation controller almost physically
painful.  MAX PAINE, which I loved on my PC, frustrated me to the
point of Controller Throwing.

Back to the subject of EQOA, one of the advantages of the PS2 is the
USB port, which allows you to plug in a keyboard, which might raise
the UI to the point of being playable.  Maybe.
