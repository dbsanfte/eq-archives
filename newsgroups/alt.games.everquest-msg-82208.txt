Hail,

Why not check out the range of services available in Blighty..
http://www.net4nowt.com/

have a full run down.

I am on Plus.net and overall its been not to bad for me, although they are
moaning that i am overusing the service (was 24/7 now changed to an average
use per day), good thing about them is the no 2hr cut off.
