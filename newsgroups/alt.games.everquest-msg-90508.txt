Yes, run speed and position is still client side.  However, Verant is very
good at making sure nobody is moving faster than they're supposed to be
(either running too fast or tping around the zone), and if someone trips a
flag, it's likely that they will be banned, and since the potential hackers
know this well, none of them do it.
