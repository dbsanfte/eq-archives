    This sounds quite fair, and not as abrupt as your first post made it
sound. It also allows the others who weren't heaping abuse on you to
understand WHY you left, which is important.

    The ENCH knows who's gonna die first if you leave. I'd love to see new
top-level ENCH robes that were either canary-yellow, or red with a small
Star Trek insignia on them....

    That's the easy way of handling Symbol costs, when you use Jaspers as
reagents. If you get paid per cast, then it's much tougher for someone to
object to the loot rules. I've had tanks insist I'm making out like a bandit
when I get ANY gems for reagents, as "those gems cost more than peridots!!!"
