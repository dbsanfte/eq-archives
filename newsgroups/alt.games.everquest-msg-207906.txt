Yeah, Druid's DS was unaccounted for in your example.  Problem I had
duoing with Druid in mid-50s is that both of the Druids I tried
insisted on healing me mid-fight, which was not only unnecessary, it
got them agro which cost still more mana to deal with.  It didn't
matter what I said, they absolutely refused to let me get below 70%
or so without tossing a heal at me.  So, instead of the Druid being
focussed on killing the mobs faster so less healing was required
the Druids both ended up OOM from healing both of us during the
fight (DoT, DoT, Snare, Heal, "OMG get it off me!"), rather than a
single heal added to my own healing at the end of the fight and
just an occasional med break because we were both LOM.  The Shaman
I worked with had no trouble at all with the idea that he should
only heal me mid-fight if I asked for it.  He hasted, slowed, kept
regen on us both, handled about 80% of the crowd-control, healed his
pet every now and then (Booboo was tough enough to keep one add busy
while he rooted another), DoT'd everything, nuked casters, and spent
about half his time cannidancing (never seen any non-Bard that busy).
The only buffs he kept on my were haste/hp/sta/agi, and the hp/sta
were only useful because they gave some extra margin when the adds
got thick.
