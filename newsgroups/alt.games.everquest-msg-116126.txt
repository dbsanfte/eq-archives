 It could be interpreted as them needing one for themselves but would
sell the first one they got to the Druid and then try for the one they
needed. At least based on the above quote. They didn't come out and say
they weren't farming the item for themselves.

 And also since you mentioned there was nobody in there 15 minutes
earlier, I'm not sure how that's classified as perma-farming. Unless
someone else was the one mentioning that in another message. Hard to
keep track of who said what these days.
