I think this is the point the current system MAKES people come together, out
of necessity.
Most people I know who play EQ/EQ2 do so as an escape from the outside world
of rules and boundaries and having to spend time with people you don't like
just so you can eat.
I personally don't mind, I like people, but those that are more solo
orientated should be allowed to follow their needs, to be able to explore on
their own sometimes without the complications of a group, to be able to be
selfish from time to time.

Yes EQ/EQ2 are social games but we shouldn't loose sight of the fact that it
doesn't need to be in every aspect.
Before I even started playing EQ my partner was playing and I used to spend
many a long night watching him being (mostly) alone in the world of norath,
he travelled from Qenos to Freeport and then on to Faydark by himself (died
down a big pit on the way and explored and I think became a better player
because of it.

I think what EQ/EQ2 needs is a system where people are rewarded for grouping
but solo players aren't penalised, where the people who need to group most
of the time can do so, the people that don't really want to interact can do
so and those that want to do a bit of both are able to.

Yes the players of EQ and EQ2 are in an online world full of people but why
can't they be alone when they want to and be with people when they want to
(as so many of us do in RL)

Just my two peneth
Ceri :o)
