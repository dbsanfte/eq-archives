}Also thanks for not just recommending I go to the Bazaar.  That is the WHOLE
}reason I'm asking, is what is the point in looking if you don't know what to
}look for or how much to spend on it?

Well, you see, there's this lovely search interface on the /bazaar 
searcher that wil let you turn up items no one has ever heard of, and wen 
you're talking about smal amounts of cash like you've got (sorry), there 
are probably 50-100 items worth considering, and the real decision 
should be on the basis of which one is stupidly underpriced.

Alternately, you might look for something with a focus effect on it.  
Especially ones that have 'affliction' of 'reanimation' in the name, for 
necros.  If you're getting close to level 20, you might want to start 
looking at second-rank focus items.  My recent experiences with twinking 
out a mage suggest that these items make a heck of a lot more difference 
than a couple measly int will, but a good number of these items have some 
measly int anyway. :)

If it has 'haste' in the name of the effect, it increases your odds of 
being able to channel certain spells.  If it has 'efficiency' or 
'preservation', it decreases how fast you use up mana, so it's just like 
making the mana bar that much longer...

My cheesy focus item page: http://www.geocities.com/zinphandelchianti/

Robe of Enshroudment might be a reasonable replacement for your advisor... 
4 Int still, and has Reanimation Haste II, and I've seen them for 50-75pp 
a lot.

Kobold Hide Boots.  Extended Affliction II.  That means your DoTs last 
longer and do more damage to the target.

Those are the two that really stick out to me.

}I'll check out those bat skull ear rings (for 100pp or less each or per 2?).

200-400pp on my server, each, since they added a focus effect to them.  
Even if it is just Reagent Conservation I.  Bleah.
