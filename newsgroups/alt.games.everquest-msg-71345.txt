The biggest downtime in EQ is getting ready for raids and stuff like
that. CR can be some downtime.  If anyone bitches about day-to-day
downtime, they must be soloing in sme pretty bad spots. Or getting
over thier heads. 

Example, take 6 characters, any class, and I'll bet plats to pennies
that you can chain pull in any chain pulling designed zone (DL,
Overtehre, eastern wastes, etc). With no downtime. I've been in groups
that had me, mage, as main healer and completly destroyed, no
downtime. Been in group with 3 chanters, 2 monks and a rog no
downtime. 

Now go solo, waste 60% mana on  one kill and be down for 5 minutes.
Oh and die sometimes. Has anyone *ever* died in overthere while
grouped due to something besides a goon?
