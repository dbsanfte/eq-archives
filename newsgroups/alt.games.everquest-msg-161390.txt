I have  tailoring and was able to aquire some nightmare silk trhough a
friend, just before he quit my guild and disappeared. I am finding it
difficult to make a profit out of it because i paid so much for it, but i
notice nightmare silk string sells for 2500 each. Do a lot of people need
these? Is it it worth doing the work required to get tailoring up to 161,
the point at which the string becomes trivial?

Eq traders says that the recipe requires "wax". Is that the same as a clump
of wax?
