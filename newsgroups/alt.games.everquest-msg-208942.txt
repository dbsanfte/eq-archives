The nerf is pretty flacky though. My Burnished Wooden Stave's 333 dam bolt
gets focussed and has a chance to crit.
On the other hand the 600 dam dd from velks boots never get any crits or
focus effects.

For this reason the stave can actually be a better clicky because it can do
up to 720 dam with a crit and standard around 350 whereas the boots always
do 600 (or less) no matter what. Half the casting time is also very nice :).
