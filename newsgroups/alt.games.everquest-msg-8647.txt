I'm with Bizbee on this-there are numerous ways of dealing with your mobs
responsibly without killing/incoveniencing other people.I had to park my lvl
55 Druid at the docks in Oasis while my new Chanter hunted crocs with his
group there.This was because every half hour or so some idiot would pull
more spectres than they could handle and would run straight down the beach
away from them to the zone.The Specs would just wipe out all the newbies
they came across until someone took them out. I shouldnt have to have
another character standing by to try and minimise the damage every time some
selfish fool endangers 80% of the people in the zone.
Yes Norrath is a dangerous World, but even in the real world people are
expected to behave in certain ways so as not to cause others danger.
