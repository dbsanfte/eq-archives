I know for a fact that they don't all See Invis.  I've snuck past SO many
Kobolds in there that there is no way in the world they are See Invis.  And
this is not affected by the Sneak's LoS-variance.  I've been *right* in
front of them.

The local-shaman-buffing-his-friends theory is very sound and true with this
kind of zone.
