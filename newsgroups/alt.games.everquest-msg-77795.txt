first question is why use a Monk to level a Druid? The Necro would be better
with the Darkness Fear combo provided that you don't over do it with the
Darkness dots. If you plan on going after high yellows low reds animal type
mobs I would use the Druid DS, Sow, Regen, and Panic animal spells. Major
problem in both cases once the Druid or the Necro get high on the Hate list
Monk may not be able to pull them off without Taunt. Personal opinion to
level a Druid a Large Race Warrior would have been a better choice. Slam,
Taunt, Higher AC, More MR Resist Gear,  and Higher HPs. In a long fight the
Monk won't survive.
