I think the current arrangement in EQ is a good balance in this regard
(though I know some people point to it as another "training wheels"
element in the game).  If you die at a low level, there's no penalty
other than the time to get back to whatever you were doing (and maybe
get fresh buffs and re-memorize spells).  After level 10, you do lose
experience (but not much until mid to high levels), but can get most of
it back via resurrection if you can find the corpse, and you have to get
to the corpse to regain your gear.  It used to be the big screw was if
you couldn't find (or reach) your corpse, because then the experience
loss was permanent and your items were gone.  Yes, it made players more
careful about dying, which is good, but stuff happens, and people did
occasionally lose all their gear.

A while back, they added Shadowrest.  If you died and didn't retrieve
the corpse, the corpse would appear in Shadowrest a week later and you
could at least get your gear back.  (It would be too late to rez.)  But
being unable to play your character for a week sucks, as does losing xp
permanently.

With the introduction of the Guild Lobby in the previous expansion(*),
players have a reasonable choice.  They can summon their corpse there
for a modest fee (based on level) and get it rezzed and get their gear.
But doing so means they're back in civilisation, and getting back to
whatever they were doing can take a while.  So people often still prefer
to bind closer to where they're hunting, with the intent to run back in
and get their corpse "in situ" if they die.  But if things go sour, you
have the Guild Lobby to fall back on so the penalty isn't as big as it
used to be.

(*) Do I win anything for being the first to refer to Dragons of Norrath
as the "previous expansion"? :-)
