Hiya all!

    Forgive me if something similiar to this has been posted, however, I
have exhausted a search for this type of discussion on DejaNews now with no
avail.

    I'm hoping to start a thread concerning guilds.  Not which existing
guild is what, however, what things you believe are the crucial keypoints or
traits of a guild in order for you to not only join but become active and
participate within.

    I won't bother kidding anyone by pretending as if Im not going to use
information from this thread in order to better the guild in which I am
currently leader of. :)  However, I'm really curious to know everyone's
opinion on the following:

1.  What traits do you look for in a guild?  (this is a broad question,
however, just point out the key traits, unless of course you wish to list
them all)

2.  What type of recruitment do you consider most favorable? (ie.
Invitations via tell to those non-guilded persons, open /ooc or /shout
advertisement/invitation, etc.)

3.  What do you feel is a guilds key to success?  (ie. member base [number
of])

4.  What type of services should a guild offer you the member?

5.  What features should the guild offer on their website?


    I've already asked members of our guild questions 2-5, however, as I
mentioned I would like to get the opinions of all of you, regardless of
guild, server, class or level.

    Those not wishing to reply via the group (of which is your parogative),
please dont hesitate to send a reply via email.

Sincerely,
Jacobson
