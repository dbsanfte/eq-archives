I thought I read something on a website or patch message a while back about
this dealing with deleveling on a PvP server, but I don't know if it applied
to just those or all servers.

Apparently you can loose two levels and keep your skills in tact, but you
can only keep skills/skillpoints that are two levels above your current
level.  Example:  As a 17th level monk, you could get knocked back to 15 and
still have the ability to FD with normal 17th level skill points, but if you
went back to 14 for some reason, you would loose FD and your skill caps
would move back to that of level 16.

I think they said the reason for this was because of people purposely
deleveling on the PvP servers (don't know why it sould make sense to do
this, but hey, to each their own)
