I learned this in Runnyeye while camping it for a BA Medallion for
an alt.  The banker's banking range is just a smidge greater than
his agro range, so sometimes he'd attack me while I was doing my
business. I'd finish my banking, then root him and camp a few steps
away to clear agro.  Pretty silly from an RP perspective, but very
handy as a game-play mechanic.
