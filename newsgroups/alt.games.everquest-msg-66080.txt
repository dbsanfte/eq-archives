The second one in my opinion.

Take this line:

>The first skill level will increase the maximum by 10%,

This denotes it only effects a 'maximum'. I can't believe it would only
effect someone with maxed Bind wound (hence 'healing max per bandage' -
bandages heal for a fixed amount, based on skill). At 200 BW skill, you
can already heal up to 70% I believe, so this seems to me to be an
increase on the 'cannot bandage over 50%/70%' cap.

Unsure however, if it means:
60%/70%/80% (percentage value added to 50%), or 
80%/90%/100% (percentage value added to 70%), or 
55%/60%/65% (percentage increase to 50%), or
77%/84%/91% (percentage increase to 70%)

If you look at the class skill:
"Bandage Wound: (3 skill levels - Prerequisite: 3 skill levels of the
General ability First Aid) - This ability allows the Warrior to use the
Bind Wounds skill to greater effect. The first skill level makes his
Bind Wound skill 10% more effective, the second skill level raises the
increase to 25% and the third makes the increase 50%."

That seems to relate directly to 'hps healed per bandage' since BW skill
determines hps healed

Guess we'll find out soon enough
