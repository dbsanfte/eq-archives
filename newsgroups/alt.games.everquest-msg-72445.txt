  I personally doubt we'll see player housing in EQ.  The game just
isn't structured to support it.  Things like lack of NPC binders and
the hybrid experience penalty were stubborn decisions made by Verant
in accordance with their "Vision".  Houses, on the other hand, are
probably something they'd like to implement, but it's something that
would be technically difficult to accomplish given the current
infrastructure of the game.  If homes were implemented in EverQuest, I
bet they'd implement them in the form of special "neighborhood zones"
which neighbor city zones (or, perhaps in some instances, wilderness
zones).  These zones would probably be coded specially to support the
automated addition of new structures with the necessary associated
variables, something I very much doubt current zones could feasibly
support.
