IRL, most adventurers I've read about _were_ merchants (or the agents.
of merchants, not much of a distinction really).

It would be nice if trades were truly an alternate way to advance,
so that Monual the Cleric/Smith would be just as much a hybrid as
Kaev the Warrior/Cleric (aka Paladin), and would therefore not be
as powerful a Cleric as a character who wasn't a hybrid.  It would,
of course, be better still if there wasn't a single superior choice
of "adventurer" class for hybrid tradeskillers.

After thousands of deaths one of them finally stuck?  Poor old Lucan,
still a target after all these years.  ;)
