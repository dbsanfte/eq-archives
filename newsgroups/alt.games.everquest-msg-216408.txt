Very interesting perspective on the impact of LDoN, some reactions below:

I believe you because I've heard that about many guilds. I'll just toss in
that it is possible to find a guild that is more mature and balanced in its
outlook towards the game but still is ambitious for those who want to be. I
know this cause I'm lucky enough to be in one, the Knights of Omen on the
Saryrn server.

Same answer as above.

I don't actually agree about NBG, and actually it is widely applied in LDoN
groups at least so far. And my guild's DKP system seems to work fine and
fair, and not every guild is rife with cliques.

All that said, you make a valid basic point: playing LDoN long and well
eliminates uncertainty about the rewards and the need to rely on others to
get yourself those rewards. That is a real plus, and does seem to undermine
one part of the reason for guilds to exist.

I couldn't agree with this more. If I was in an anal guild that expected me
to spend all my online time raiding -- well actually I'd have quit such a
guild long before now, but if I was on the edge, LDoN would push me over
without question.

My guild hasn't seen that, but if some are, then....maybe LDoN will make it
harder to keep a guild together if you treat players like peons. That would
certainly be a Good Thing, based on all the unhappiness I see and hear about
some of the issues you listed.
