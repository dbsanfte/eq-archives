There have been two instances now where I trade something for some
money, and when I look in my inventory, I didn't get the money. Both
times, it was trivial money for a trivial object so I didn't worry
about it too much, but it kind of has me worried. I'm almost certain
that when the deal went down, the money definitely showed up on his
half so I don't think anyone was trying to rip me off. The only thing
that I can figure is,at the last second, just before I hit the trade
button, he took the money away. That would of course, require him to
time it almost perfectly so that it doesn't undo my acceptance of the
trade. I'm sure there is some kind of explanation as to why this
happened, so I'm not too worried about it. Anyway, if anyone has any
suggestion on what might have caused this (even if it involves
stupidity on my part), feel free to let me know. Thanks.
