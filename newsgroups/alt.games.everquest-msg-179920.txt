Heh, well I guess this world wasn't quite as static as I had assumed.

Anyways, there's really nothing wrong with hunting guards (from a
roleplaying aspect), as long as it's for a reason.  My paladin did a few
levels in Nek forest killing kinky er... inky guards.  She may go on to
Rivervale to kill halflings, but that's more due to the fact that I'm sick
of assling druids.

Now, I guess it's a good thing that trolls don't have cultural.  I can see
some poor troll warrior with a stack of invisiblilty potions sweating
bullets at the forge.
