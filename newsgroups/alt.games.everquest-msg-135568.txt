    Bergh's point, which you disputed, was that clerics didn't have slow
mana regen. I'm pointing out that, of all the pure casters, clerics have the
slowest mana regen. That's why we whine for the FT toys - if we're OOM, not
only does the raid stop but it takes the longest to get us back up and
running again.

    How many mages for Mala and enchanters for slow do we have? I'd prefer
shaman slow/malo, but I can at least work around it. And the waiting is
gonna be a lot less than if we were waiting on a cleric to get mana back.

    They have the same mana regen on their self-buff. BUT the mage can still
summon t-rods, which are a net mana source. So the mage, when solo, has
t-rods AND his self-buff. The cleric only has his self-buff. Clearer? ;-)

    If you want to go high-end, a necromancer with Holgresh beads doesn't
need anything around but himself. He'd be petless, but rotting is quite
viable for the class. Or he can just pull the next mob with Vexing Mordania
(sp) and get back to full health pretty damn fast. And enchanters DO have
access to that AA ability to give themselves full mana, remember? ;-)

    I'm willing to bet the following is happening:

    Your cleric sits and only casts CH (or faster heals if you overpull, but
I doubt you do) and Counteract Disease if a slow lands on you. The only
buffs the cleric applies are Aegolism and Resist Disease. The cleric doesn't
debuff.

    Your shaman casts torpor and/or small heals on you. The shaman buffs
with Khura's, Riotous Health, maybe AGI, Resist Disease, Celerity (or
whatever top-end SHM haste is), Regrowth, maybe even the shaman AC buff. The
shaman Turgurs every mob you pull, and uses JBB and/or epic spear to deal
damage to the mob (so he doesn't sit and med as much as the cleric). You may
even be using the shaman's pet as an extra DoT on your mobs.

    So you use the shaman to increase your damage output and to debuff the
mob in addition to just as a healer. You shouldn't be surprised that he uses
more mana given that. And you should be happy that the shaman can do that
and keep pace with you. If you had a bot cleric that, in addition to just
healing you and casting a buff once in a blue moon, cast MoR/MoK and one
Judgement on every mob you'd be closer to matching jobs. And you'd begin to
see how slow that cleric mana regen is. ;-)

    I'd never take it as attitude. You put up with my emoticons, so you have
to put up with more anyways! =)
