Boy, am I glad I included that caveat. I went to find the old
parses, and what I found instead were some new ones, including
commentry by the folks who contributed significantly to the old
ones.

The URL is here:

Its a pretty comprehensive set of parses on ATK data, and you're
right - STR now does appear to work exactly the same way as ATK. it
didn't used to though ;) Honest ;)

My apologies for the misleading information ;)
