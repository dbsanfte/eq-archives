You're statement is incorrect, though it's admirable how you have
decided that you speak for "most people". Even if I *did* see the last
post in the thread, I may have read it yesterday and forgotten what was
asked, etc. And if they came in out of order (quite common with some
providers' NNTP servers) then I have no clue what it is that the top
poster is blathering about. So, aside from truly being the standard for
most all groups, your argument is invalid.

As to the weak argument about there being "too much old material to
scroll down past" (Like *THAT* really takes you a long time. *sigh*)
that is, again, just an example of poor snipping. Look at this post you
are reading right now. Only the relevant sections to which I am
responding are left in. The rest is snipped. It's short and it flows in
the order of the conversation going on. You have made no point at all.
