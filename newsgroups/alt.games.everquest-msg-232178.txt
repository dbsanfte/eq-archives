}Yes - as an example, Burnout V (top mage pet haste) and Araq's
}Celerity (top BL pet haste) are 85% hastes vs.  VQ's 68% haste.
}However, VQ's +atk, dex and agi all stack.  That's why you see
}both icons - the higher haste takes precedence, but the other
}components stack.  So, my pets will be very happy with that :)

Necros Mages and Beastlords definitely can.  Shamans are always asking me 
to haste their pet, though.  And sometimes druids and SKs.  And when I'm 
really bored and epic-equipped, I like click-hasting the cleric and wizard 
pets. :)

Sometimes, the necro, mage, and/or bst ask for haste too... my haste lasts 
substantially longer, I think.  Well, that and the stacking issue you 
mention. :)  But on their pets my haste frequently won't take hold, so 
something somewhere ain't stacking.
