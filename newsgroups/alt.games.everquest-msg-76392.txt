That's what I did the first time I played (erased my druid at level 39
since she was on an account I didn't own) and dinged on average once a
day or every two days.
I've now dinged 55 three times in the past five nights. (Sky raid with
associated death and a bardic pull by a bard that royally screwed up,
both followed by level 49 rezes. I don't like when my exp goes
backwards, so I went and got my warrior through level 14 instead)
