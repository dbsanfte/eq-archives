hotkey
/tell bergh rez this %t body

Ooooh its sooooo hard to hit that button when you get to the room?

Don't have space for the hotkey?  Type it once and you can just shift up arrow
it instead.

A pile of bodies with several clerics rezzing means some bodies getting rezzed
more than once and some getting rezzed not at all.  Eventually it all gets
sorted out, to be sure, but using direct tell to cleric means it gets sorted out
faster.

Sometimes you will already be out of range for the assist before the cleric gets
to your tell.  He'll still be able to /target name based on the name you sent
and probably pick up the body that way.  If not, he'll know to keep looking for
it.  With the "pile of random bodies" method there's no telling whats there and
who is supposed to be on it.

If you want the 40 corpses rezed before the room pops, instead of 37 of them
rezzed and people shouting back and forth about where the other bodies are, you
might want to try my tip.  Your way is less efficient.  I'm not suggesting that
it doesn't work, I've certainly dealt with multiple people bringing unremarked
bodies in at random intervals to multiple clerics.  We call rezzes in channel
and try to keep track of whats going on.  Its not that it can't be done, but its
slower, and I thought you were worried about time!
