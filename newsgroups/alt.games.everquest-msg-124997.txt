Well, I started off life as Human but 6 years military turned me into
Barbarian. The last 5 years of soft cushy civvy life has turned me into
Troll though... I <wish> I was Erudite, having serious mental horsepower
(without the associated insanity though thanks) easily outweighs having head
clearance issues.

My GF, coming from Thailand would easily be Wood Elf, but she wishes she was
High Elf. Thai's have a funny idea that fairer coloured skin is more
attractive. She is always running around with tiny shorts on, and just like
EQ, the biggest pervs (ie, me) can always be found directly behind on
autofollow, with stupid grins on our mugs... ; )
