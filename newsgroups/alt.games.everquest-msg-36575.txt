Sucess rate is determined by your skill and the difficulty of the pariculary
piece you are trying to make. The diffuculty is some hidden number that
Verant will never reveal. Stat have no effect on success rate.

INT or WIS effects skill rate increases. For certain skills other stats
will apply. STR effects smithing and DEX effects fletching and tailoring.
CHA only effect pricing at NPC merchants.
