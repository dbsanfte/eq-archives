I have only seen that be true on Agility. You take a LARGE ac penalty
for having 74 agility or 75 agility, you WILL notice it on a level 9
tank type.

Meanwhile, I've had 74 dex on my sk troll and got 75. I noticed
absolutely zero difference in the rate of melee skilling up, which is
what dex has to do with.

The same is true of stamina, no visible difference at 74 from 75, 
same true of charisma, same of str, same of everything.
