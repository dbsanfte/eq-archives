/agree, kinda

If the wizzy was there when he arrived, it was the wizzy's camp and, PnP policy
aside, conventional etiquette among players says he should have respected it. Let's
face it, neither of these guys were there for the experience; both wanted loot.
Both had just as much right to camp it. Doesn't matter whether the other guy had
been there 4 hours or 5 min. really, nor does it matter why he wanted the earring;
he was already there and waiting when our camp stealing friend logged in. He should
have let the wizzy have it and come back later. Doing what he did would get him
added to my "no port/no rez/no help/no nothing for joo, ever" list, if he'd done it
to me or to a friend or guildmate of mine. I respect other people's camps, and I
absolutely expect the same courtesy from them. That means that sometimes I don't
get to kill what I want at a given time. /shrug  I can always do it later. It's not
worth the ill feelings it generates to steal a camp from someone who is already
established there. In this game, good will and a good reputation are far more
important that killing a mob at that particular instant, IMHO. It's not like it
won't respawn again later. =P

OTOH, I agree that people who think they can claim *everything* in an area/dungeon
is their camp, or those who claim they are "camping" a spawn, even though they
clearly aren't on site and haven't been there for some time, are idiots and should
be blown off as diplomatically as possible. /grin

/shrug Apples and oranges. Sometimes Verant's "rules" make sense, sometimes they
don't. Personally, I think if you're paying your money, you should be able to call
yourself whatever you want; but what's in a name? =P Either way, the two issues are
unrelated.
