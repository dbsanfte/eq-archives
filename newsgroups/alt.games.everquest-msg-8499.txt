I work tech support for Roadrunner as a part time job while I'm still in
school.  Depending on where you live, an additional IP address may
be anywhere from free (some affiliates provision 5 IP addresses at no
cost at startup) to $9.95/month PER additional IP address.  Find out
which option your affiliate uses (or lemme know and I can tell you
for them :-)  ).

If it's no charge or +$4.95 a month or so, I'd say just pay for the
additional IP address and hook it up to the ethernet hub.  If it's
more than that, I'd go with the single router-provide-multiple-IP-
addresses setup, and just pay for the one RR IP through the network.

Also, tech support won't support this setup.  We'll provide the
cable modem and support for each individual computer on the
line, but everything including a hub/router isn't included on your
service contract.  DEMAND that we help you set it up, and we'll
laugh at you...well, ok...turn off the microphone and laugh at you...
;-)

Seriously, though...the double IP hookup through a simple hub
gives 99% of home-network customers 0 headaches.

Good luck!
