I believe that is a matter of preference.  I have a lev 17 nec and a lev 35
mage that I both exclusively solo with.  I like the mage better just for the
fact that you can summon food, water and weapons for your pet, no need to carry
around those rusty weapons that take up weight for your skeleton.  The biggest
plus for me however, is the ability to summon weightless bags.  There is
nothing more satisfying than being able to go out and hunt for literally hours
and hours without ever coming near a town or bank, then at the end of your 4-6
hour long session, gating back to your bind point and going to sell your 8 bags
full of bronze or better loot!
