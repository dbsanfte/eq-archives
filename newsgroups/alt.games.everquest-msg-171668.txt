His suggestion was not a "fairly even level split" but rather keeping the
rogue level at one, just enough to get access to the UMD skill.  This means a
level 10 whatever is competing with a level 9 whatever with level 1 rogue
tied on, and access to powerful magic items, rather than with a level 5
rogue/5 whatever.
