Yes here too;
Usually if I click cancel just as the patcher launches it will come to
its senses and load.
I have sent successful and unsuccessful log on files to tech support
at EQ, have had a generic reply.

This sequence or something like it seems to repeat
[16:07:44] HttpDownload Completed.
[16:07:44] InternetOpen()...
[16:07:44] InternetCrackURL()...
[16:07:44] InternetConnect()...
[16:07:44] HttpOpenRequest()...
[16:07:44] HttpSendRequest()...
[16:07:44] Downloading to local file.
[16:07:45] Begin InternetReadFile() [2]...
[16:07:45] End InternetReadFile() [2], 0 bytes downloaded...

(As an aside I was amazed at how many fonts are loaded by EQ on
startup; have a look at EverQuest.log sometime)
Doesnt seem to be widespread - which is not good for those of us
experiencing it - less pressure to fix it.
