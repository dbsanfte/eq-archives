Yes, it is.  And I not only sympathize with them, I empathize, I've
been there ("group LF tank" "paladin here" "group LF warrior").  I
wouldn't wish that on anyone, it sucks.  But nerfing knights isn't
gonna get Warriors groups.  If you nerf knights ability to tank
they'll still get groups for agro management (unless you make them
worse than RNGs/BSTs, in which cas the RNG/BST will get the group
instead).  If you nerf knights agro management groups will, again
just use RNG/BST instead.  These caster groups would use a rag doll
as a tank if it could hold agro, just buff it up and keep it healed.
You mentioned in another thread a possible nerf to highend Paladin
tanks (nothing about Shadowknights there tho  :p ), which might
correct things somewhat at raid level and perhaps in highend groups,
but casual Warriors need a way to keep the mobs off the casters.
There just isn't any way around it (unless you want to do something
like taking mounts, FT, the MC aa, and the BST Spiritual line out of
the game while nerfing the duration of all other mana regen spells to
under 60 minutes.)
