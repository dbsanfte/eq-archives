Point.  I hadn't thought of it that way.  Unfortunately (or not, I dunno),
I've been focussing mainly on my tradeskill ops and soloing a lot, so I
don't have any more experience of the HO system than I described previously.

Actually the sequence is always the same, from my limited experience.  So
much so that I put the requisite hotkeys into the order required.  So yes, I
would agree that it's a (much) more limited form of skill.

Keep in mind that taunt, slow, mez, et cetera are still there.  It's just
that there's now another thing to keep track of, not just "do I cast them
now for minimum / maximum aggro" but also "do I wait for the chain to be
prepped".

I dunno.  I do agree that combat's been "dumbed down", I'm just not sure if
it's been done too far.  I do prefer EQ1's combat mode, I think.  Question
is, can I live with this mode?

No idea.  I'm only L11, so no experience with the higher stuff yet.
