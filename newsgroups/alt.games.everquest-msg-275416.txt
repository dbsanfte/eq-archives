What?

Okay, if it's not your property, you can't sell it. If you agreed to a
contract saying you can't sell it, that only reinforces that fact. The
account isn't your property. It's rented space. The characters and
items in the game are not yours. They're SOE's exclusive property.

Learn some communication skills, then learn BASIC law before sticking
your foot in your mouth (and resurrecting a dead thread to do it like
a fucking moron, even).
