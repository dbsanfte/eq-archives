I tried the beta and really enjoyed it.  It's very much MMORPG-lite, but
great fun for a short after work stress-reliever.  Groups are fluid and are
formed *per-fight* automatically.  Thus, no KSing.  It's just not possible. 
Restricted talking has you "in-character" at all times.  Great graphics for
basically being a web game.

It's not Everquest.  But then, that will appeal to some people, and will
definitely appeal to little kids.
