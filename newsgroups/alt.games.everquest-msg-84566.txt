"Claim to"?

I see. You were willing to accept my word that I had inactive
characters named Lokari and that I didn't play those characters, but
you're not willing to accept that I've deleted them. How wonderfully
selective of you.

The only reason I "claimed" to delete the characters in question was
that some people were getting themselves thoroughly bound up in
semantics over it, and needed to have that particular horse shot out
from under them.
