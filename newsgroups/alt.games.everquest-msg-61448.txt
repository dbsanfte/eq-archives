While soloing a warrior in EQ that's true...lots more downtime in EQ than
DAOC.  Soloing an enchanter in EQ or mentalist in DAOC (eh, closest
comparison I'm intimately familiar with) has about the same amount of
boring-assed downtime.  At level 16 while soloing my mentalist I might as
well bring a book with me.

Oh yeah, and the added horrible death penalty in DAOC adds even MORE
boredom.  Even at 16 a non-rezzed death in DAOC takes me more time to earn
back the xp as it did in EQ at 29.  I hear dying WITH a rez in the 40s is
enough to make you cry...4-6 hours lost.
