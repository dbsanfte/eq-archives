Monks in groups don't have to worry about weight so much if they are getting
AC buffs and heals.  Also, the AC penalty is not significant at level 18 (as
you mentioned in a later message).  Also, if the monk is a relatively new
player, he many not even *know* that there is a weight penalty.

Did they split the coins between group members after they went to sell?  If
not, you should have been complaining loudly at that point.
