I group about 40% of the time.  About half the remaining 60% is duo or trio, and
the other half is almost entirely full group; 4 and 5 man represent well under 5%
of my time; I solo because I can do so in short shifts, or going afk a lot while
medding in the safety of Kaladim, I duo or trio because a friend and I like to do
things together whenever we are on together... and the full groups allow me to go
places and do the real labors of the game.
