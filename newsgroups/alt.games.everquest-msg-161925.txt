Two weeks ago we were getting ready to wrap up a little exp group at the
little fort in the front part of Chardok...

Last pull before split, something went horribly wrong. I mezzed the add,
tashed him and the target, and they were both slowed, the unmezzed one
snared and rooted. I sit down.

7 seconds later by my logs, I get turned into street pizza. The overhead
shot after death shows no less than 9 mobs on me... some of them named I
have never seen (we don't go that far in usually). I don't think I finished
the standing up animation before I died it happened so fast. Buffed to 2k hp
with rune III up (it's cheap).

By the time I'm through appearing at my bind point(and I tend to be a very
fast zoner), I do a /who all GUILD, (was all guildmates)... they are at
their various bind locations. The SK wasn't even able to get a feign death
off. The unsowed cleric didn't have time to make it to the zone line before
his DA dropped, and when it went down he died almost instantly.

So I think something may be up there, yeah
