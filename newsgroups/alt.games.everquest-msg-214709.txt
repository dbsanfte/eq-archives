    I have two high level iksar friends, one 65 and one just 60. The 65 is
selling his JBB, and the 60 has no intention of buying one, having tried out
the 65's one during his late 50's. From what I can tell the long cast time
makes the nuke's relatively low damage not really worth it, as it takes
canni time away that could be spent generating more mana for nukes or what
have you.

    Having logged and parsed the late 50's shammy with the JBB, his damage
output didn't go up that much when he was using it, and it produced more
downtime for the group as it ate into canni time. Considering his pet was
doing 30dps anyway, using a device that gives you another 50ish? DPS *IF*
you totally kill your canni-ing during fights just doesn't add up.

    Might be the thing to have in the low 50's but have no information on
that.

Cheers,
James
