I still don't see how buying PP for real life money is any more
idiotic than paying real life money to play the game.  If spending
some RL money to buy plat, and then using that plat to buy items,
let's you actually do *fun* stuff in the game, instead of spending
countless hours in boring camps to equip yourself better, I don't see
how it is idiotic.  It seems to me it is just another form of
twinking.
