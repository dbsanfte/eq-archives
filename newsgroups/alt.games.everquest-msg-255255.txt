Everything I've read so far is that EQ2 is targetting a different audience.
Those ith more knowledge please feel free to correct me, but my
understanding is that the original EQ will continue be for the more
'hardcore' folks who enjoy raiding and the like, while EQ2 seems to be
aiming for the more casual gamer that seems to be the bane of people's
existence here lately.  The hardcore raider will probably be bored to tears
with EQ2, from what I read.

I'm no more emotionally attached to my EQ characters than I am to my golf
clubs.  I plan on trying EQ2, and if I like it better I'll have absolutely
no problem playing it exclusively.

MHO, FWIW
