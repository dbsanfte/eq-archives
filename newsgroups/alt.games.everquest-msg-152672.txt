Ok finally biting the bullet to get run 3 but have a question yall
might have a resource for.

Concerning AA bar it was my understanding that the bar filled at the
level 51 rate with no racial or class penalties. So at 55 turned to
100% AA, killed 4 level 42-45 mobs (blue con) solo, got perhaps a
pixel of movement in bar. THis seems way too slow to reflect what
should have been a good 1/2 to full blue even at old hell level 51. 
Also was under the impression there was no penalty for lt blues kills
to AA although that seemed odd.

Is there a definitive source for this info?
