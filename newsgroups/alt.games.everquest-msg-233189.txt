Jenn, try this:

Set up a hotkey for targeting the raid tanks, in reverse order.  Assuming
Billy, Jimmy, and Sarah are your tanks, with Billy as MA, Jimmy is SA, and
Sarah is TA.
If your hotkey says:

/tar Sarah
/tar Jimmy
/tar Billy

Then it will shift between targets (at a rate of one every one-tenth
second), stopping at the *last one alive*.  Thus, if you need to target the
MA, hit the key and it stops at Billy.  If Billy is already dead, you'll get
Jimmy and a line of 'I don't see anyone with that name here.'  And that's
just fine, you can ress him later - it won't target a corpse.  A very good
cleric of my acquaintance has a key like this for both MAs and Enchanters.
You'll need to edit this every raid, unless you always have the same folks
in the same positions every raid, but that's a minor problem for the
convenience.

Another good hotkey is the simple /assist.  Target any melee in the raid and
hit this button twice - the first time you'll get the mob, the second time
you'll get whoever the mob is hitting.  By repeatedly double-tapping this
button, you can assure yourself you're always on whatever player the mob is
currently playing whack-a-mole with.  So simple, so necessary, like a Ming
vase.
