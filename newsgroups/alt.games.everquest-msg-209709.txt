If it's done without talking first or even any indication from me that
I'm looking for a group, it's about like grabbing my arm when I'm
walking down the street talking to a friend and trying to lead me off
to a party without saying a word to me in the process.

....or travelers passing through the zone? Or hanging out
tradeskilling? Naaaah, the only reason a high level character could
possibly EVER be in a lower level zone would be to "slum".

Rathe mts, by the way, is a cash farm. No one hunts there for the xp,
because the xp isn't worth the time it takes to kill the giants.
