The main problem with a pet class pulling is that if the
puller gets hit the pet runs off to 'save' thier master which
can mess up the pull. With the pet hold AA the pet only attacks
when told to attack. Or if the necro can keep very good
control of the pet with the /pet back off command.

Necros can pull with snare and FD. Snare a mob, run
away from the mobs, FD and wait for all the unsnared
mobs to return to their spawn points and then stand up
and bring back the snared one. Easy.

But with 6 necros you can just have the puller not have
a pet.
