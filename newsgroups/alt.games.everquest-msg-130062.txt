Unless, of course, there was antiaircraft fire, eh?  Or
doesn't that matter?

That doesn't change the fact that firing at a gunship
is not a smart thing to do.  As despicable as you find

What I find "despicable and pathetic" is your refusal
to acknowledge that it is appropriate to return fire
when fired upon.
