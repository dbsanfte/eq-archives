Who says there *should* be an easy button? Why do we automatically assume 
it best that the player even be *able* to put their character's progression 
into fast-forward mode? Sure, it has it's upside - the primary of which is 
its allowing them to play with their friends sooner - but that doesn't 
automatically qualify it as a good idea.

My would wager that the number of those who would use it for the reasonable 
purpose you describe would pale in comparison to the number of whom would 
abuse it simply because they can.

I feel that when a game is designed around character progression, that 
progression shouldn't be circumvented for any reason.

Except that view doesn't at all take into consideration what is best for 
the game, only what is best for the "offending" player.

Only when that behavioral change is for the worse, on which point we 
obviously differ.

I'm all for that, but before we can even begin, we need to recognize the 
effects for what they are, rather than ignore them out of convenience. For 
example, I personally feel that the behaviors many refer to as "cheating" 
do, in fact, have a detrimental *effect* on the game, whereas you obviously 
disagree. It leads to the same debate, just with different points of issue.
