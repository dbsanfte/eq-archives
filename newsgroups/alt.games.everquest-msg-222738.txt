Google was not conclusive.

It sounds like it was vaporware to me. Something that almost came out, 
or maybe even hit beta...Hence putting an author to writing a book on 
it, and hackers get a shot at 'upgrading' it.

I would sooner believe that the user was using ME and thought it was 
2kHE than actually had 2kHE. But I'm not going to write off the 
possibility...

FYI: Here's a summary of what google had to say on the subject.

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=%22Windows+2000+Home+Edition%22&btnG=Google+Search

Top 10 hits:

1) A book at amazon.com about Window XP Home edition that mentions that 
the author wrote a book about Windows 2000 Home edition also.

2) A link to some proxy/nat/router software that apparently doesn't work 
with W2k HE

3) A link to a hack site for converting HE to Pro

4) A link to PCLaw5 support saying that Win2k HE is compatible in peer 
networks.

5) A link that offhandly recalls that MS released Windows ME instead of 
the 'rumoured' 2k HE for compatibility reasons.

6) A link to a survey that includes 2KHE in the list of OSes.

7) A link to information for new law students at Carolina Law school on 
suitable operating systems, 2khe is included in the list.

8) A link to a mailing list post scoffing at the lack of an 2KHE product.

9) A link to a usenet post archive where someone claims they like to 
think of 'Windows 98SE' as a 'Windows 2000 Home Edition'.

10) A link to a post archive where someone claims there is no 'Windows 
2000 Home Edition'
