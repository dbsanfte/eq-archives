*snort* like you're going to be able to escape that easily! Muhahahaha

All kidding aside, I wish you luck.  I wish I had a life before I started
playing that I could go back to. :)  I do find myself starting to think of
reasons NOT to log on, or to log off early, but that lack of a life thing
keeps me in the game more often than not.

I've found that buying a book you can't put down helps.  Usually a James
Patterson or a Clancy novel will do that for me (no need to flame Patterson,
I know they're stupid).
