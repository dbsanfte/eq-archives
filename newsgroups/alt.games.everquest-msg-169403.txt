Your best bet is to make sure that  you are not running any other processes
when you start up eq.  I had a problem where every few minutes or so the eq
screen would just lock for a sec or two and then go again, but my music
would not stop and the really weird thing is mobs that were chasing me would
go off in the direction that i was running and pass me by because of it.  I
eventually turned of the default windows xp firewall and some other apps
that were running and that seemed to fix it.

Good luck.
