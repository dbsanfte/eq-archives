Hey there.  I have a logitech Mouseman Wheel M-CW47 and my mouse wheel
doesn't work in game on the chat window.  My friend has a standard ms
mouse with mouse wheel and he scrolls just fine.  In every other
function outside of EQ, I can scroll with the wheel but not in EQ.  Any
ideas?  Any one else have this mouse too and have their mouse wheel
working?  Thanks in advance.
