There are two methods for "running."

One is the Monty Python method of everyone running in the opposite
direction, screaming and soiling their armor.

Second is a coordinated retreat. Someone will stand and hold the mobs for a
few seconds to let the soft and gooey types (casters) to run for it. Me, as
a cleric, will get to the furthest range of a heal spell and tag the last
fighter of ours with some healing, just to buy some extra seconds. Once I
feel that the tank might/will survive, and the casters have started zoning,
I break off. Telling the tank, I'm gone.

Hopefully the tank follows. But it gives you that stilted look and if people
don't know what you are doing they will freeze.
