Well, I am at a loss to figure out why your druid hasn't gotten it, assuming of
course that your druid is a halfling...  but your ranger, again assuming it is
a halfling, wouldn't start getting the message until lvl 15 anyway.  :)

The worst part of all this is, I have a halfer druid myself and for the life of
me cannot remember where the guy is in RV...  I've recently let my account
expire as I'm fed up at the current state of the game so I can't even log in
and look around for you.

Sorry...
