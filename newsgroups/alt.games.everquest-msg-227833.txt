Thanks (and thanks to all the others who have posted advice)... Honestly, 
my plan wasn't so much a series of upgrades to HP and Mana whose effects 
I could, perhaps, parse out over a few weeks of playing, but rather one 
thing that would make noticeable difference, like my Goblin Gazughi Ring 
did (charming would have been such a pain without it). Ideally, an 
illusion item or something like the Holgresh Elder Beads (whose price 
has reached escape velocity, I know). Failing that, I guess I'll look at 
focus items... at least I see the effects of those in every cast, rather 
than when I get hit, which, if I'm playing well, is not often).

I mostly wanted something that would perhaps encourage me to get playing 
again... In the last few weeks, the only character in my account that 
has seen any love is my Bazaar mule.
