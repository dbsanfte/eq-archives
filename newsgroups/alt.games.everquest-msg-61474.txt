What is happening is you are getting a message on your desktop while you are
playing EQ. my guess would be that you are running out of virtual memory.
When you get the problem within 5 mins of playing, your computer has
probably been running apps and stuff prior to playing EQ and is getting full
of crap that you're not using anymore. If you are using win 98 I believe
that you have to manually allocate more vitual memory to avoid this from
happening, while w2k would attomatically assign you more (but would still
cause the dinging) A safish way to check what is happedning on your desktop
while playing EQ is to change resolution to 640X480 on the old interface,
and set your f10 key to change to a different resolution in the desplay
option menu (800X600 for ex)  then you hit the dreaded windows key. You may
lose all mouse control depending on the luck of the dice, but you will see
your desktop. You then can fiddle around. *note: any keystroke you do on
your desktop also happens in EQ! don't do this near a ledge!* you then hit
alt-tab and nothing should change in what you see, hit f10 and voila! your
back in EQ! This works perfectly in win2k, but maybe not too well with win
98.  Using this you should be able to tell what is happening *hopefully*,
otherwise simply allocate more virtual memory, and see if it helps.  One
thing I'm 98% sure of is it is not a hardware problem. if anything other
than virt mem, then it's drivers, software, conflicting apps running in
background etc...
