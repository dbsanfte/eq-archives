As a general remark, some of the OP's questions are covered in
the FAQ.  Specifically, veteran rewards (question 2.10) and the
summaries of what got added/changed in the various expansions (2.3).

As to the rest, Bebinn's reply was pretty thorough, but I'll add
a few comments.

Yup, at one point they gave some months advance notice, then deleted
all characters under level *10* (I believe) who hadn't been played
for six months or more.  That probably killed your trader.  I doubt
there's any way to recover her now, but I suppose you could petition
and see.

I usually see at least some people grouping at most levels, e.g. at
the Skyfire ramp in Overthere, etc.  Many people will be in the new
expansion zones since those offer content for all levels.  Others will
be in whatever the current "hot zone" is for their level.  (Hot zones
are a concept that may have been introduced while you were gone.  They
are a set of zones for various levels where there's a big boost on xp.
Every six months or so, Sony restores the zones to their old xp value
and boosts the xp on a new set of hot zones.  The update message tells
when they do this.  Anyway, hot zones are a good place to look for
groups.)

Bebinn answered this pretty well, but failed to mention where it is.
The Guild Lobby entrance is in PoK, west of the "short bank".  The
Guild Hall entrance is at the far end of the Guild Lobby.

Also, if somehow you fail to recover your corpse, after a week the
corpse is available in a special zone called Shadowrest that you can
get to by talking to certain NPCs.  This used to be a way to at least
get your gear back from an unreachable corpse, but that was before the
Guild Lobby got added.  I doubt it gets much use any more.

I encourage you to read the FAQ on these.  There's a limit to how
many of your characters can get veteran rewards, and once you give
them to a character there's no way to undo the choice, so choose
wisely, grasshopper!

I also disagree with Bebinn about the utility of the rewards.  The
free 100% xp rez for all your corpses is definitely useful (and I
often wish my account had enough years on it to let me use that one),
but so are the Steadfast Servant (casts aggro-free heals and buffs
on you and your group) and the "double experience for 30 minutes,
once per day".  The "max stats for a little while" reward is useful
against some raid targets to boost resists vs spells.

The three Freeport zones got redone as two zones; most of the old
content is still there but the layout has changed for a lot of it.
Likewise, the two Desert of Ro zones and the Oasis got combined and
laid out as just two zones, with the old Oasis contents in the north
end of the new Southern Desert of Ro.

Boats haven't been running for years.  About the time the Progression
Servers were due to start, it looked like maybe the boats were going
to get fixed (which would have made sense as part of trying to restore
more of the feel of the original game), but they never got very far at
it.  For a while the boat to/from the Abysmal Sea ship was running
again, but it's gone again now.  As Bebinn says, just use the gnomes.
(I still hold out a vague hope that the boats will be repaired someday
so I can ride the icebreaker to Velious.)

I firmly believe in using the keyboard; I leave my fingers poised
over the numbers row and hit hotkeys that way rather than moving the
mouse to click on the displayed buttons.  Likewise I usually use
alt-digit to cast spells instead of clicking on gems (assuming I don't
have a hotkey for the spell, of course).  On the other hand, my wife's
a confirmed mouse-user, and she does fine too.  So go with whatever
works for you.

The FAQ does include many suggestions for things to put into hotkeys,
useful typed commands and single-key actions to know about, etc.

Many spells are available in PoK, but every once in a while I come
across one that requires a trip to my home city, or Firiona Vie (the
elves are now hiding in an outpost at the east end of the zone), or
the moon.  As Bebinn said, check Allakhazam; their info about where
the spell is found is generally pretty good.  (Caster's Realm was way
out of date the last I checked.)  Many higher level spells that used
to be available only as loot can be crafted now by players.
