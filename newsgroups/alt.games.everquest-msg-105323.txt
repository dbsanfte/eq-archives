Or Verant lost power.
Or a backbone router anywhere near Verant went down.
Or Verant was bombed by terrorists
Or an employee turned off the wrong switch
Or YOUR internet connection was hacked

If you can't get on EQ's board that's a fairly good indication that EQ is
down...if folks can't get in the game they're going to try to go to the
website.  What happens when 10,000+ people all at once want to check out why
EQ is down?
