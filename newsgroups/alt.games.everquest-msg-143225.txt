I see no meaningful difference, at least in the theoretical case
of a revol against a hypothetical oppressive federal government
in the U.S.  As far as Billy Jobob Cracker is concerned the
guvmint <is> an imperialist occupation.

At times.  At other times, most of the time actually, that conflict
bore no resemblence to so-called conventional warfare.  Don't forget

that the Vietnamese had been fighting colonial occupiers since WW II,
first the Japanese, then the French, finally the U.S.

Well, I guess we're in disagreement there.

But, off the top of my head, there's always the English Civil War.

Also, the way I see it, the point isn't to prove that the citizens
could rise up and defeat the federal government.  The point is to
make the level of risk too high for the government to engage in
"oppressive" policies.  As with any "security" scenario, there is
no such thing as a perfect solution, so you raise the bar as high
as you can without causing unacceptable negative consequences.  So
while I don't agree with all of the public positions taken by the
NRA, and I despise their deliberate misquotation of the Second
Amendment, I do believe that they are a necessary and important
voice in our body politic.
