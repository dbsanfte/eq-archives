I hunted with my Chanter till I was lvl 30 in Ill Omen.... My Paladin is now
hunting there.  There is
a good backdoor to the Goblin Cave that is fairly easy to control. There is
also grouping available
at the fort, both back door and ledge. The only problem is the run from
Fironia Vie..... and no
supplies in Ill Omen zone, altho you can sell items at the mill.
