Just started myself a baby bard.  Was so excited about her that I already
did the solstice earring quest.  Only to learn that my starting stats are
karked.  That is...I took the word of a friend (several friends in fact)
who claimed that Dex helps bards not fizzle their songs.  I learned later
that it is CHA that does this, not dex, and even if it were dex, I should
have put my starting stats into STA (just like every other class..oh gee,
how original Sony).

Anyhow...I'm not too worried about her stamina.  It's a better starting
stamina than my ranger, and Foxeye is doing fine. But I'm not sure about
the charisma vs dex thing.  Does mediocre charisma hurt bards really
badly?  Vah Shir have horrid starting CHA, so if it matters...then I gotta
reroll, 4k wasted cash be damned.
