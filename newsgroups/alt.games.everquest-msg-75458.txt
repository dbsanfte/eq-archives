Well, you wont' be soloing in there, that's for sure. :-)
Seriously, I have, no occasion, seen people getting up the rare pick-up
group for the EW side entry area. But it's rare. Generally it's a BYOG
zone. Plus, you aren't going to get much in the way of quest armor drops
at the entry or the bank. I've been told they can drop anywhere in
there, but I've never seen shit drop off the little giants near the
zones. The big drops happen in the Arena, and to a lesser extent, the
Riff House. You will *not* be going into the Arena with one group at
your level. You won't even make it to the door. It's a guild raid sort
of place to party. Have your guild set up a Kael raid and bring a number
of good, strong groups to take and hold part of the arena.

Aside from the above, you should know that only the smaller frost giants
(which you'll find closer to the entrance) give faction hits with the
dorfs. (You'll need to be kindly to the dorfs to do the qeusts.) The big
storm giants that frequently drop the quest armor pieces only give CoV
faction, but you'll want that soon anyway.

From what I can tell, it's a total random crapshoot. Just keeping
killing storm giants until what you need drops.

Drop only. You can get them in Kael, Velks, and (I'm told) WL, but I've
never hunted in WL so haven't seen any.

Good luck.
