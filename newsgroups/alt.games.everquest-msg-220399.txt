Dennis,
Can you give a basis for the last statement?

Druids, as the original parent class to Rangers, can understandably have
tracking.  Druids are priests of ALL the wild things, wolf and bear and lion
as well as plants and rivers.  Tracking logically makes sense there.  Druid
tracking is about half of the range of Ranger tracking; my 34 ranger has a
wider range than my love's 61 druid.

Bards, I have to agree with you - Bardic tracking is kind of silly, they're
not theoretically outdoorsmen of any sort.  Bards were given tracking IMHO
because they were the 'catch as catch can' class - able to do anything, if
not well.  And Bards don't track well - my Bard's tracking is maxed for
class, and he's unable to track things *in visual range!*  What good is
that?  I only use tracking when fighting near a spawn point to know when
something's up - "Let's finish up this Goranga, the named is up at his spawn
point on the other side of the hill" sort of thing.

Raivenn Lunatic,
55 Bard
