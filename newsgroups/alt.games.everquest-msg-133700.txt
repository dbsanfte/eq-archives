A few people have posted complaining about how Verant handles requests to
restore deleted characters.

Up until the time I quit I had always assumed that your characters were
completely gone if you ever let your account expire (there's a user
friendly cartoon [I *THINK* it was UF] where a man is having trouble
cancelling his EQ account after not playing for 6 months, I always assumed
the difficulty was because he was going to lose his characters).  I was
overjoyed to find that they remain and are re-activated along with your
account if you ever return.

I think its incredibly nice of them to even consider restoring deleted
characters (I've been computing since DOS 2.1, so to me "undeleting" still
seems a little fruity).  Maybe if we as players accepted that hitting
delete is pretty serious, and gracefully accepted whatever their decision
is when we petition to have deleted characters restored we could acheive
happiness and inner peace.

Or we could just go complain on newgroups...  Either way...
