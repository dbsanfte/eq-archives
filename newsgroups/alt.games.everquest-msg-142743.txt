Tell them to e-mail me with how they did it, then.  I assume no twinkage, or
fungi-fun?  Anyways, there are always those who can play a class to it's
best advantage.  Even so, a paladin soloing is a painful thing to watch.
Every time I take on a mob, I assume the likelyhood is very high that I'll
be casting rez soon.  Sure, we have decent HP, as compared to rangers, but
it doesn't take mobs very long to chew through it when you can't land a
single hit.

Well, the inability to fear kit kinda sucks.  And our damage output is isn't
quite up to par.  I'd say rangers sit quite nicely above paladins on the
ranking.

Precia can do very little damage, and becomes ground beef very quickly
anyways.  Maybe inflicting only a single red bubble in the time it takes for
a blue undead mob to drain my entire lifebar has something to do with that.

You no fool me, round eye.
