I have read several posts on this new server and people seem to have a bad
feeling about the evil team. Something about them being able to defeat the
newts and goodies or something.

I think us Erudite necromancers/evil clerics, we are kinda screwed. Got
goods and newts crushing the life out of us =p

Trying to make a run out of Qeynos some how to make it to the dark elf zone
is like hell.

I cant speak for the newt or good team but it would seem all evil people
except Iksars have it kind of hard...
