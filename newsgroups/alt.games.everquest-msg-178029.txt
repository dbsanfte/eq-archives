PC exp starts to slow down in the early 20s anyway, so I'd say pass on 
that.  Although keep in mind there are other mobs there that nobody else 
ever fights.  It's mostly bandits, and a few fighting the bugs on the 
other end.  If you're willing to deal with the dot they cast, the 
phlarge fiends are *never* being killed, at least on emarr.

Looking at the EQatlas hunting guide by level 
(http://www.eqatlas.com/huntguidelevel.html), I'd say Kurns' is also 
going to be too low for you.  Especially with a druid.

I've heard LOIO is actually quite a nice place when you solo, so you 
could try there.  When I run through Netherbian Lair, it's usually got 
maybe one group in it, that's about it, so you could give that a try, or 
go through to DSP and see how you do there.  Runnyeye and Sol A are both 
dungeons, although I'm not sure how popular Sol A is (I do know it's a 
popular spot for farming, so...).  If your druid could go in first and 
break a room for the enchanter, Runnyeye might actually be a good spot.  
It's *never* used.  You could also try Echo Caverns - I've never seen 
the needlite room camped, and it was decent exp for me and another rogue 
when we tried the room around that level.  Fast pops, too.  Oh, and 
Stonebrunt Mountains - really out of the way, so usually empty, and lots 
of camps at the entrance that should be doable.

And... that's about it.  Of course, having never PL'd anyone or been 
PL'd by anyone... ;p but those are a few of the places I've heard are 
decent exp.
