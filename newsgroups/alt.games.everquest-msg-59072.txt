    Dennis said he doesn't like PvP, in part, because the "gangup" nature of
it makes for a poor game experience. ShadowSpawn countered by saying it's
like real life warfare, which is what he wants. Dennis is now trying to
point out that in "real life" games, we set the conditions so at least in
theory there will be competition. If you remember that this is supposed to
be about PvP GAMES, and not wars, it makes sense. 8)
