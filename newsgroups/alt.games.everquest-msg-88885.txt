I went all over with my druid Friday night and could not find anything
anywhere.  Sunday night I went to Everfrost to hunt Mammies and it said "It is
unusually warm" or something to that effect.  There were werewolves and mad
specters to hunt.  I picked up a Pegasus Feathered Headdress, which was better
that the Runed Circlet (barely) than I was wearing.  It was the only event I
saw.
