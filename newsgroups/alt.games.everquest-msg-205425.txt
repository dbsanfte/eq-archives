I really get annoyed by that sort of BS.  "this is too slow, I
gotta be killing easier mobs" (note the 'I').  When several
members of spectacularly lame guild group insisted on going to
Nexus/Bazaar in middle of session the other night, after maybe
30 minutes of fighting in about 2 hours of play (no down time
to speak of, just "this is too hard" or "this is no good let's
move"), I gated 'em to Nexus and camped even though I was set to
play for another couple hours.  Better to go to bed early than
put up with any more of that frustration.

I guess I'm spoiled by a number of excellent guild groups lately.
I now find solo play to be either boring with slow xp (rotting),
or excruciatingly tedious with ok xp (quadding).  But that "too
hard"/"too slow"/"we're pathetic twits who can't handle challenge"
attitude can really drain the fun out of a group.
