Let me answer for him, then... It is rude because it has been established by 
general societal consensus that it is. There is nothing *inherently* rude 
about those words, it has just been decided that those are 'the' rude words 
because people need rude words, both to offend and to take offense at, and 
those happen to fit the bill. If "fuck" didn't exist, it would have to be 
invented.
