I always have Jolt up.  Granted 99% of the time I don't grab agro with
melee or archery, there is that sometimes chance.  Most instances is
when I have a poorly equipped warrior tanking for me.  I remember one
time the poor guy couldn't keep agro off me even when I sacrificed Cry
of Thunder for Jolting Blades, which I then resorted to my 2HS weapon
from Sol Ro Tower that procs jolt itself.  You never know when you need
to drop your agro in a pinch, and simply turning off attack only
lessens your DPS while the tanks are trying to grab agro off of you.  I
alternate between Jolt and Cinder Jolt depending on which zone I'm in. 
It's also heavily useful for instances of when you're fighting
UberMobBoss_3837 in a raid where melee is heavily dependant and you
can't use archery (though this may differ with the DX9 patch)...
jolting constantly was a key to keep myself alive as well as help keep
the raid on track (AoW, Emperor Ssra...)
