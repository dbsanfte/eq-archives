Yeah, because the way you "like to RP your character" extends across
to placing definitions on other people's characters and the NPCs of
the world that their creators didn't put there. RP your own character
however you want...as long as it doesn't trample the framework of the
world you're RPing in or alter other people's characters without their
consent. When you do that, you're not just RPing your own character,
but theirs as well.
