Yes, the normal heals will be more mana efficient than the
Celestial line.   The Celestial line is used for aggro management
rather than efficiency.

Yes, chain-casting Healing will heal more HPs for less mana.  And
Greater Healing will be far more efficient as well.  But a mob is
MUCH more likely to ignore a Heal-over-Time spell than it is a heal
that takes effect immediately.

At the point you get the heal it's overpowered in that you'd have
to chain-cast your best heal to heal more HPs.  That's pretty
much the same as a Heal-over-Time anyway without the benefit
of a single cast time.  But once you get Greater Healing you'll be
able to see the aggro management benefit of the Celestial line.

Mana efficiency is important but it's not as important as aggro
management.  It's far better to be alive and able to heal than to
be efficient and sitting at your bind point while the rest of the
group dies.
