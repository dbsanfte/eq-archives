}That, plus Wolf Form from a friendly druid seems to be a good way to kick-
}start Oggok faction. If you get it high enough that you can do the Stein of 
}Moggok quest, the faction hits from it are massive.

Except the fleshes are a bloody annoying long camp.  You're much better 
off going straight to the Stein quest if you're after faction, and then 
doing lizard meat, lizard tails, and lizardman scout fifes when you're 
high enough.  There's still no way to raise faction with Oggok merchants 
or the banker, though. :/ Well, beyond illusions and alliance.

And then for troll faction there's a neat new beastlord quest for froglok 
blood... :) Won't help you with the troll guards, but it raises you with 
the beastlord, shadow knight, and shaman guilds.  For the guards I suspect 
I'm gonna have to haul a bucketload of fire beetle eyes down there one of 
these days. :)
