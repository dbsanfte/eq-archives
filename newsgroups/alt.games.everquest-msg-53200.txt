The Agi and AC buffs are pretty minor (ok, thats a lot of agility, but
agility doesn't translate into much of an AC boost for most people) and
the stamina regen only helps those who haven't figured out they
need lighter weapons.  Even if the AC/Agi buff is significant, only
the main tank should care.

The fact that it lasts longer, and therefore costs less mana per hour
to keep up is its main advantage.

If you are having mana problems, sure, augmentation is better than
nothing.... but alacrity, if you can afford it, translates to more
damage output over time from your tanks.  The quicker stuff dies,
the less damage it does... so alacrity probably saves a lot
more of your tank's health than augmentation would.

As a meleeing cleric, I was always been happy to get augmentation,
since its not much bother, while alacrity puts me on the
permanent maintenance load of the chanter.  Course I also
found in most groups that I really didn't need clarity, that should
be reserved for those heavy casting classes like paladins.

haven't been able to outmelee a paladin since 44, so I don't
bother much with alacrity/augmentation any more.
