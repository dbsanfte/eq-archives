For a group, just use the /g prefix for groupspeak. Example:
/g %t has been snared.
(You don't want to put "A %t has been snared" because so many mob names
start with "a" this or that. Then your message comes out "A an orc pawn
has been snared".

To get fancy, you can use some of the modifier keys and use:
/g %t has been snared. %s should slow down now.

The %s should return a gender specific "he", "she" or "it" (if
non-gendered). So the message would now say, "Sergeant Slate has been
snared. He should slow down now."

[Edit: Note - Now that I think about it, %s may return "him", "her" or
"it". It might be %o. You should look it up in help. I'm not home to
check just now. It's one of them anyway.]

As to the raid question, yes. If you are only in one channel, let's say,
then your raid channel will be channel one by default. If not, you can
check which number channel is your raid channel. Assuming it's number 1,
just modify your button to say:
/1 %t has been snared.

Works fine. There's quite a few of the % key arguments available that
can make your hot keys a lot more flexible, fun, and interesting.  Check
it out.
