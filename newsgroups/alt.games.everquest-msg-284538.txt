Hehe, not playing much of a wizard then.

Yes, you can play a wizard like that, but no you don't have to, and you 
can be far more involved.

My wizard debufs the mob, may be snaring, nukes, stuns to prevent heals, 
  stuns to prevent gate, may use translocational anchor to prevent 
gating, is often scouting with an eye in places we've not been or where 
mob location can be random (pre-targeting for pacify through doors for 
example), nuking anywhere from 9-10 times per mob depending on the zone, 
using concussion to avoid drawing aggro, dragging mobs off clerics and 
enchanters in zones where it's possible to do so, kiting adds if 
required, off-rooting adds if required, depending on the group makeup 
may be providing damage shield for the tank, may be using spellshield 
and other spell damage reducing buffs, using aa such as the xuzl swords 
when available, providing fixed invis, etc., etc.
