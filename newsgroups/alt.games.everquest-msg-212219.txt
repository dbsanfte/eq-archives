40?!  Seems like a fairly large drop in effectiveness for a 10%
drop in skill caps.  Well, unless a high-end Warrior with that
particular toy [*] is doing 400 DPS.  I see that it's Ranger and
Monk usable also, any suggestion as to how much advantage those
classes would have over a Warrior with it?

[*] For any following this who can't be bothered to google it,
Vanazir is a silly PoTime 2hs:  60dmg, 38dly, metric buttload
of stats (incl. +230 hp), and a 100dd proc that's a -27ac debuff
and so likely generates quite a little extra hate.
