  Ya, I was wondering if that was a simple mistake, but given the nature
of the post I'm not so sure.  Regardless, calling out personal vendettas
against users of another forum, no matter how richly deserved, rarely
work out from what I've seen.  Wait, what am I'm saying?  I've seen
people request that other people mailbomb their target and like, but
never actually move to another venue to punish them.  Ok... attempting
to sic us dogs after someone is really, really not likely to work.  If
they are truly obnoxious enough, the community they are posting on will
self regulate.  I would think that that is especially true on an SOE
board, where the mods have been know to be a little, ok extremely,
delete happy.
