The bottom line, never never never EVER drop anything on the ground.
Even to twink. Be patient and wait for a friend. I know this was an
unusual case, but it is worth repeating.

On another note, a similar exploit was used to steal my Wurmslayer
from me. This was back when the WS was a giant item, and would only
fit in an gen inv slot, not a bag. A lvl 1 war asked to see it to get
the stats, a bard with invis song was near. When I showed the WS to
him he hit cancel, the WS dropped to the ground and he ran with Selos
, zoned and logged. /bye Wurmslayer.

It was about 2weeks later (i petitioned) that the WS was changed to
large. It now fits into a bag. At least verant did something about
this apparent exploit.

Since then I NEVER EVER show an item to someone, unless I know them,
or can see a guild tag. /anon people are totally out for sales or
purchases of ANY kind.
