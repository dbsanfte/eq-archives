All of the pure casters (int or wis) that I've looked at on Lucy have
well over 100 spells.  Enchanter class has 275 spells in the live-server
spdat, of which I'd guess between 225 and 260 are actually in PC spell-
books (some spells are duplicates, dunno why, and some are rare drops
that may not have been found yet, and some just aren't actually in the
game in scribable form yet).  Hell, even the hybrids show over 100
spells in the spdat.
