I've had similar happen, but what happens to me doesn't really piss me
off at all.  I have a level 40 bard as my main.  Sometimes when I'm
done with a group, say goodbye and all and disband a friendly druid
will cast SoW on me while I'm firing up my Selo's.  A lot of times I
seem to miss the message.  I think that Selo's sticks, and I'm running
thinking, "why am I running so slowly with Selo's and a Mistmoore
Drum?  Much to my chigrin, I find out that SoW was cast on me.  I
don't get pissed about it, but in dangerous areas I want to be running
as fast as I can.
For those that don't play a bard, a SoW cast by a level 50 druid is
slow compared to a Bard with Selo's and a Mistmoore Drum drum at Level
40.  I know they mean well, but I would think seeing a character in
Lambent Armor would tip them off that I probably don't need it. 
Though, I guess I'll find myself asking/paying for a SoW when I hit
Level 46 and get my Chant of Frost song.
