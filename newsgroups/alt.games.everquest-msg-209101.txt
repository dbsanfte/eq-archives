I pre-ordered and found my graphics all reverted to pre-luclin.  I had 2
characters in skyfire, both L56 with aa's.  One could login and the other
got the "You have been disconnected".  Waited a few hours till they fixed
it, logged in and checked my characters and found no loss of level or aa.
Only problem was that my windows were all in the wrong places.
