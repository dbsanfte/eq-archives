Reminds me of the best newbie guide I've ever seen, which is at
http://www.somethingawful.com/eq/newbieguide/index.htm

Here's the section on names:



A name is the most important aspect of your character. Make sure to
choose a title that effectively "roleplays" your character's
personality. For example, here's how to make a name for a Druid
character: this class is very close to nature, and likes trees and the
woods and various biodegradable things. Create a name that combines a
stupid nature reference in category A with a goofy pseudo-verb in
category B.

Category A: stupid nature references.
Moon
Sun
Tree
Leaf
Mist
Wolf
Star 
        
Category B: goofy pseudo-verbs.
Wynd
Jammer
Gater 
Skymmer
Walker
Sweeper
Skypper 


Optimal name combinations include "Moonskymmer", "Mistwalker",
"Sunsweeper", and "Wolfwalker".


*       If you're one of the many 12-year olds who enjoy playing as a
Necromancer, be sure to name yourself after your favorite Pokï¿½mon.

*       When choosing a name, try to use the letters "a", "e", and "h"
as much as possible. Feel free to take your name and "roleplayify" it.
For example, "Jason" turns into "Jahsaen", "Steve" can become "Staevah",
and "Rob" is easily "Raehbeaahhea'aeah".

*       Warriors should all be named after a particularly violent action
or verb. "Smasher", "Breaker", "Crusher", and "Basher" are all valid
names. If you're playing as an Ogre Warrior, misspell the word as well
(ie, "Smashur", "Breakur", "Crushar", "Bashur").
