Ok, I've nailed down the memory problem for my two machines. I'm on to
the video card ordering situation like the OP. Finding the AGP card for
a good price online seems to be no problem (for my gateway machine) but
finding a PCI card for the IBM machine is a bit of a challenge. I know
they exist, because I called a local dealer and he's got a Geforce Max
68 MB one for 119 bucks. I'm thinking I can do better online, but
following some of the links suggested here I'm not seeing PCI choices.
Ok... I'm dense. Can anyone reccomend a specific card/link/dealer where
I can find the appropriate PCI slot matching 68 MB card for my IBM
machine?
TIA
