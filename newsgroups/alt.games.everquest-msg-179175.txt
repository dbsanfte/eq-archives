Tool design and implementation, artistic expression, I would say religion
but God influences and protects the animals as much as us, you ask why are
so many animals killed on the roads every day, why would God let that
happen, and I would say he didn't strangle and kill nearly all the available
fertile land in dry rock and drive our cars over helpless animals, which are
the same as children when you think about it as they are blameless. There is
still time to change luckily.



My heart is so scarred and hardened that I could easily call down deadly
lightning storms and earthquakes on cities if I had the permission to but
even I am ashamed at the thought of knowingly continuing a lifestyle that
must kill thousands of animals each day, and all the animals tortured in the
name of science and industry, but why? What do we need to learn that is so
amazing when we have forgotten everything that makes life bearable and
sometimes even enjoyable?



It seems like nearly everything that was invented in the last century is a
piece of garbage, what is so engaging about sitting in a darkened theatre
and staring at a glowing screen for 2 hours on a date to have your mind
desensitized and manipulated how ever someone wants it to be, that's how I
view media as a useful tool for manipulating mass populations, and that is
really what it is, and why it was invented and I am using it now to
influence you, and most of you probably don't even realize it.

I believe that we are no better than animals.  Nothing special about us at
all.
