I loved NwN. 

The single player plot line is cliche, and easily second guessed, but
the story is fun to play through. It kept me playing until I finished
it. The farther you get into the game the better it gets (like
EQ...more skills, spells, better equipment etc). There are a lot of
decent side quests to do as you play through the single player game. I
am eagerly awaiting for the expansion (if there is one coming).

There are a lot of user made scenarios and even persistent worlds
online to download. From what I hear this is where NwN really shines.
To be honest I have not gotten into that aspect of NwN (too addicted
to EQ to put in the effort). The multiplayer aspect is hit and miss.
There are a LOT of hacked characters out there (a la Diablo), so you
have to be careful which servers you log into. "Vault" servers lock
down gear and stats, and are better at keeping cheating to a minimum.

NwN is a lot like EQ...and a lot different at the same time. If you
have a D&D background (pen&paper...books...other PC games) it is
easier to get into. If not you will find yourself comparing it to EQ
and getting annoyed at the differences (this happened to a friend of
mine).
