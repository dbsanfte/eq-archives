The 'patriot act' was orwellian enough. If you aren't a criminal why 
would it bother you to give up your privacy. If the FBI wants to install 
a TV that can see into your home, why, it would be downright un-American 
not to welcome it! Only terrorists and deviants have something to hide!

Sure I'm reaching. But stuff like this has happened in other countries a 
few times in the last couple hundred years, in Germany, in China, and 
elsewhere. The US is not magically immune.

A panel of judges should be sufficient to interpret the consitution, and 
the law. What does the opinion of 51% of Arkansas have to do with it? 
Are they sufficiently educated in law to make an informed decision. Does 
the (hypothetical) fact that 75% of Arkansas is Christian mean they 
should be able to outlaw displays of non-christian religious beleifs?

Should the Christian majority be allowed to railroad over the beleifs of 
the tiny minorities??

How is gay marriage any different? What difference does it make if 51% 
or 78% or 92% of the people in Arkansas beleive gay marriage is wrong? 
Its none of their business, none of their concern, and ultimately if the 
tables were somehow turned, they would scream blue murder if a gay 
majority population decided to ban state recognition of Christian 
marriage ceremonies.
