Quick Q.  What int caster items are available out there with
regen of some sort on them?  The reason I ask is that I will
get to 56 (not soon, but eventually :) ) and have Mod Rod 2.
By summoning one, then using it up a mage nets 260mana for 900
hp.  To make the best use of it will require the highest regen
possible.  With Innate Regen 3, and Phantom armor I have 13hp
per tick now.  That means that approximately every 70 ticks
I could get 260mana from this.  (3.7mana/tick extra).  If I
can get a hold of some sort of right click, or wearable regen
item, it will effectively boost my mana regen rate.
