    I dont gain xp any faster with KEI. If I'm using KEI im either farming
mobs that would otherwise slowly kill me (lifetaps are EXPENSIVE and my only
healing above 50% when solo) or I'm in a group using it to keep my mana up
for nukes etc.

    And frankly, even at level 48 with KEI a shadowknights casting abilities
make a MINISCULE positive effect on the speed a group's xp comes in. On the
other hand, grouping without it I'm constantly oom and that puts me and my
group in grave danger if anything goes wrong (not being able to feign death
or cast fear or a taunt spell is bad)

    OR if im in a 2 or 3 member group and we're fear kiting me having KEI is
a lot more important.

    I guess the final argument is this. You pay 75pp because its worth that
to you. I pay 10pp cos its worth that to me. The chanters casting it get an
average high enough to justify casting it, and everybody's happy.

Cheers,
James
