I'm using the little flatscreen from Sony that came with my PC back in
october, and have been perfectly
happy with it for most EQ purposes.  The only caveat is that when my kids
are playing their
characters and I'm looking over their shoulders I sometimes have some
trouble making things out...
the picture is great head on, but loses a little something from extreme
angles.
