SoW is significantly less increase than the 70% wolf form I mentioned, SoW
is 55% increase at level 50.  Also, in addition to being self-buffed with
SoW, snow griffons also have the 1.50 runspeed, so even with level 40 SoW,
they're running faster than the level 60 wolf form (70%)

Default runspeed is 1.25, both mobs and players.  Some mobs (read my post)
have a higher (or lower, such as spectres and beetles) runspeed.
