I have a level 61 druid that I 2box and generally use as a heal bot. I 
have a right click dot effect from the bracer (Drones of Doom), a right 
click snare from the earring, and right click regen from the bp. Damage 
Shield spell always going on my Paladin, regen, str buff.

I was wondering, are there any other right click items that cause either 
dd or dot damage for no mana that a human druid of Tunare could use? 
Would it be worth it to get the druid the epic?

Also, for those of you that play druids, what spells would you consider 
essential to have for a non-kiting druid, up to level 61, emphasizing 
the 2box aspect? What aa skills would you go after first, knowing your 
druid will be a buff/port/heal bot for the duration of it's career?

Thirdly, I've been using some of the Ro line that lowers armor class 
when I'm fighting undead mobs, thinking higher slays result from lower 
ac. Am I wasting the druid's mana with this?
