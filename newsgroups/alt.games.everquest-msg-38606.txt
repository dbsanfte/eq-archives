Personally, I would like to see minimum level limits on high end items.  It
is disgusting to see low level twinks decked out in equipment that a level
50 would have a hard time acquiring in a middle or low level zone.  This
more than anything else destroys the overall balance of the game and
penalizes new players who do not have the ability to twink or buy from ebay.
A simple solution would be that a procing item could not be equipped until
the player was of a high enough level to invoke the proc.  That more than
all the nerfing VI will ever do would restore balance to the game at all
levels.
