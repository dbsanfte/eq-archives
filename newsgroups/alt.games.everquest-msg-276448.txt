Hi All;

I've just received my new computer (yahoo).  It's has an AMD 64 4000+. I put 
it on an MSI NEO2 motherboard.

This setup supports the AMD Cool 'N' Quiet mode. Supposedly this will 
monitor processor speed and cooling fan speed. If I enable this mode, it 
will adjust the processor and fan to the load and speed up the processor 
under heavy load (read games) and the fan to cool it down when the processor 
heats up. When under a light load, I guess like reading e-mail or just 
surfing the net, it's suppose to throttle back the processor speed and 
cooling fan, and run in a cooler more quiet.

My question to the group: To those that have that have this type of setup, 
does this speed up / slow down EQ2 making the game act weird or hard to 
play??

Thanks in advance for you help and any suggestions you may have.
