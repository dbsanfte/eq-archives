You probably have, but I suggest you bug this... "Everytime" it
happens....  I run into so many people that complain about various
bugs (ones I had no idea were happening, due to class specific etc),
and the person has never bugged it...   
Also, the more detail you go into about what exactly is occuring, will
help the team get to a resolution quicker..

Thats got to suck...  Again, include this information in your bug
report... hell do a bug, and a feeback.  couldnt hurt.

good luck
