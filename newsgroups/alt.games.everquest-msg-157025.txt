On T.Marr though they all are camped at the Paw pillars. No one goes inside
Paw, this is the most under utilized zone. (Though I love hunting in the
front rooms at 28 - 32 or so). I wish they would do something like in DAOC
and give "camp bonuses" these would be huge in the under utilized zones,
making people at least stop in once in a while to eat up the extra xps. It
would also be nice to see people move on once these bonuses went away at all
spots (never happen, it is too easy to camp the spires or the hermit, why do
something else).............

Sony also needs to add an other zone like Lake Rathe with good cash and
low - mid blues for 50+ that are as plentiful. Giants in Everfrost are too
few.

Shadowed men are only killed (it seems) by someone trying to do the necro
sythe quest, or someone being PL'ed who has a puller that can get em in
singles or singles + pet.
