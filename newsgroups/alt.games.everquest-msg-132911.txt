Good job jaZZ. Acurate info.
Me. I had to get to Velious the old fashion way - I took the boat.
Long trip but it drops you right at the first island with the gnome
pirates - includes a hany little Soul Binder now too :) The pirates
wont help you but it is very safe there. Only snow cougars here, they
are indifferent at first IIRC. The best place to start out I think.
Progessing toward Thurg. Get your cougar skin mask maybe some cougar
claw earrings. Then work outside the Ry'Gorr fort. Then inside and
Crystal Caverns. Then either Great Divide or Wakening Lands.
Definately get in a Giant group for the faction. Also look into the
Colain Ring or the Colain Pray Shawl quest and start those. Also, Ice
Forged shackles, Eye patch of plunder, Thurg, Kael and Sky Shrine
armor and a bunch of other good stuff can be had here. Keep you busy
untill level 60 easy.

N'joy
