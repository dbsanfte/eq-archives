No dont worry about that.  The only thing you have to watch out for is (for
example) if you have an item with
slot 1 type 1
slot 2 type 2
slot 3 type 3
and you have a type all, a type all, and a type 2.  So you do NOT want to
add the type all, the type all, and then the type 2 because then the second
type all would drop into the type 2 slot and the type 2 aug would not fit
the type 3 slot.  See?  Kind of an unusual situation though as most people
would care about the type 3 slot long before thinking about buying any type
2 aug.  Anyway if you have to dilute out a type all augment someday it is
probably not a big deal.
