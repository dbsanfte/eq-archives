From Casters Realm

NEW CLERIC SPELLS ON TEST
A number of new spells were added to the Test Server for Clerics today.  Two
of the spells should provide some extra versatility to the healing options
available for Clerics, whilst the others may be more useful in general
gameplay.
Here are the details:

Hammer of Judgement
Yaulp V
Ethereal Light
Ethereal Elixir

The usual Test Server disclaimer applies: these spells may change before
going live, or not go live at all.

healing.
