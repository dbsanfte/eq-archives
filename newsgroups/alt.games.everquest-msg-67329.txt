I did a little test on this spell to see if it affected trade skills.

I was trying to advance my tinkering.  Last night, I did 18 attempts without
the spell being cast.  6 successes, 2 skill increases.

Tonight, I made 20 attempts while under the spell's influence.  5 successes,
2 skill increases.

Now granted, I didn't do a lot of attempts, but it didn't seem to do a lot.

I may try it with fletching, where I can buy the components for a couple of
hundred attempts and see what happens.
