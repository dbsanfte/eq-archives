Ack, thats a pity.  Once again, spells that do
more than one thing tend to suck compared to
the real thing.

I've used snare to single pull mobs with my bard
(snaring the one I didn't want and running off out
of its follow range with the other in tow) and thought
it would work much better for someone with
FD and a snare duration longer than three tics.
