Oh man, you stopped just in time. Urza block was completely broken and
started a horrible downward spiral in tournament play. And yes, type2 was
always promoted more. Every shop had two types of tournaments, type2 or some
draft. Both of which make WotC very happy. When Urza block was halfway thru
I left magic but kept my cards just in case. Then friends of mine that had
kept on playing told me that WotC banned Dark Ritual (big black! how could
you?!?) in extended (my favorite format). It was becoming so T2 decks could
consistently beat extended decks from what I heard (especially B vs B, I
mean banning ritual?!). After that I sold all my cards and vowed never to
look back.

And now I play Everquest... Cool... And now Jamie Wakefield plays Asheron's
Call... Cool... Heh.
