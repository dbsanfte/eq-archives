Yeah, I always wonder about all the "new" guilds I see hanging around
a zone and shouting their "Now recruiting all levels, just hail me"
messages.

I've been a guild officer now for 5 levels and haven't invited anyone yet.

I did recruit several new players that impressed me with their playing,
before I
was an officer, by getting an officer to come and invite them.
Haven't met any non-guilded players since then, that I was grouped with
long enough and often enough to consider inviting them.  Most good players
who WANT to join a guild have already done so by their early 20's I think.

Anyone got good tips on "weeding out" the less obvious idiots?  LOL
