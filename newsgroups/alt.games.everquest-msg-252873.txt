I recently saw a guy describe how he hunts the shadowed men (numerous zones)
for the shadow of essence while he is LFG (75 - 150p).

I tend to go after rockhopper hides in DSP (I am a 58 druid) which go for
from like 40 to 340 p depending upon rarity of hide, or sometimes if in a
real funk, I go to Jaggedpine Forest and forage plant shoots (30 p) and kill
giant anacondas for their meats (30 p).

I was wondering if others could contribute their rather brainless, almost
dangerless, solo activities that generate a little coin while in LFG mode,
especially if you are lvl 58 ish. This can be a farming type thing with
tradeskill (making padded leathers), or it can be a mob(s) / zone where the
easy drops are still worth a little something.
