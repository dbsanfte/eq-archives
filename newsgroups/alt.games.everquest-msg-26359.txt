How does this idea sound...

Somewhere in the new upcoming zone of Stoneburnt mountains place a snowball
portal that takes anyone too.... Steamfont!

And a new snowball in Steamfont to do the reverse?  Wishfull thinking
but...I for one would love it.

Another dream would be to have boat bypass portals at all boat docks that
work with a minimum level of say...20.  This would still allow newbies to
experience the "WOW" joy of there first boat ride, the "ehh" of the 2nd-5th,
and the "this sucks" from that point on.  I know at my level, I should just
pay a druid or wizard and port.

just a thought/rant
