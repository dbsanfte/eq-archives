Sure you can, but i would personally wait for a guide to come and lift my
arse.
My personal opinion about camp owning is that first come first serve. No-one
should ask another player for a camp. Tough luck, wasn't your lucky day to
get that sweet spot.

I would ask you to bugger off if you would ask me to leave.
I'm a person too who most likely had to wait for hes turn for that camp.

You might have sensed from previous sentences that i'm not a big fan of
verants "play gay"-rules. :F

I dont ask for anyones camps ever, nor do i leave hanging around to wait
camp owner to log off. I find that irritating even if the one who hangs
around is healing/buffing me for free. People are doing that just to make me
feel i'm a bad person because i'm not giving my spot to such nice person who
"unselfishly" is helping me out there.
If i buf/help a person who is camping, i just slip the crack/sow and bugger
off.

I'm not much of a camping person myself, but i hate when a horde of newbs
come swarming around when i have decided to take few hits at some camp
incase something would drop. If i dont answer their query whether i would
share the camp (I dont usually answer because play-gay rules permit me from
saying so horredous as 'No'), the little buggers start to pull from the camp
while i am medding and then dare /y for help when they overpull MY camp or
MY rare spawn. I usually respond to such stupidity with /chucle. Thank god
play-gay rules still allow me to not help the retards.

Whoa! That evolved into a flame. Didn't think this issue would be so
delicate to me.

Oh.. One more thing. If i die while camping and someone has took my camp, i
just collect my belongings(damn, how do you spell that?) and staunter to a
new place.
