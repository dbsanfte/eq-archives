Being a mid-40s player myself, I'll try to answer anyway:
There's a globe in Sleeper's Tomb, and any amount of dragon
statues... Maybe there's a new continent being added with
Luclin, not just the moon? And the globe and statue have
something to do with this? End-game players will now
ridicule my answer. One thing I do know, though, is that
the globe shows more than five continents/islands...
