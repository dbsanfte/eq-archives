It's been a long time since I played my bard.....

At least one of the Bard mana songs only works on the "pulse" of the
song (if memory serves these are the songs without icons only the
message "your mind clears"). This is in contrast to most songs that
run for 3 ticks. So when a bard twists a "pulse" mana song with other
songs in combat he is only giving 1 tick of many regen. 

Clearly it is situational. Depending on the group make-up and mana
usage there are a few times when playing only the mana song is
optimal. That said a good bard will twist in songs that help the group
conserve mana (mezzing, slowing, damage shields, resists, etc). Bard
songs don't use mana (with a couple of exceptions), so any time the
bard takes over a mana-costing role (such as snaring runners), the
group benefits. The trick is convincing the other members of the group
that this is the case. At times it is so subtle that it goes unnoticed
until the bard leaves.
