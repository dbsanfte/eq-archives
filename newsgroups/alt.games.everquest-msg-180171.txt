Ok, this weekend took my first two trips to PoJ.  I am a level 51
Iksar Monk.  On each trip I was the youngest, but on each trip there
was not anyone very well informed on the zone mechanics. (i.e. aggro,
pathing, etc)
The first trip was with all casters except my self, and we did fairly
well.  We setup in one of the cell's that have a view of the
graveyard.  I was the puller, and on each pull would bring adds, that
I could not FD wipe.  They of course were the nasty little rats, and
on a few occasions the Golier's(sp?).  
It was my understanding previously that I needed to be 51 to hunt here
because of this very case of adds, but it appears to be the same issue
at 51.
In the second group, we had more melee that included a 55 pally, and
53 warrior. First we setup in the Hall and promptly had to evac
because of the numerous adds.  We setup in a room and adds did not
appear to be an issue, except from the pops in the room we were
camping.

Where is the make or break point of adds from the rats and Goliers?
Faction question, Kill a Golier, and get a positive faction hit for
Tribunal creatures, and a negative for tribunal prisoners? WTF? to me
that didnt make sense.  I would think it would have been the opposite.

I am not really looking for info on the Trials, for as I understand it
a char should be 60 or higher before even considering an attempt.

Any and all guideance you can put in this little brain of mine would
be greatly appreciated.


Oh, and on a similar thought, any other plane that would be good for
an exp group that includes my 51 monk, I of course am not looking for
a pickup group, and will bring my own.

good hunting
