Man you don't get it..

Hes a cheat. He helps to ruin the game, he can rot in a pit for all I care.

Fuck cheats, and fuck the idiots who give them the benefit of the doubt.

Whether he scams or not, hes a fuck.  The game would be better without the
likes of him, and likely you (you sure sound like a user of his services, to
care to defend him so much)

Oh did i mention the word fuck enough yet? Fuck you.
