	Either type is probably going to die if they get into serious trouble, but
it's far worse for the fighters.  Every casting class in this game except
Clerics gets an invisibility spell, after all.

	And at high level, you are not going to "leg it across a zone" unless you
can outrun the mobs; that means SoW, or the ability to snare or root.

	Most fighter classes can't even TRY.
