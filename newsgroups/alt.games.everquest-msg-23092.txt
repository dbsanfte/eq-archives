    Others have told you about using the potion. I'll tell you about using
that card. Sadly, Halv was killed by a player there - the cards drop off the
Watchmen, in addition to being given out as part of this quest:

    When my cleric was younger, and Manik wouldn't give me the cards due to
low faction, I used cards off dead Watchmen until turning in the cards
raised my faction enough to continue the quest.
