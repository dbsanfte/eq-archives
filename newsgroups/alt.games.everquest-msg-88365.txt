Generally, it's not so much the OS that causes such problems as people have,
more the video and sound card and the *drivers*. You have missed by about
two months the FUN FUN FUN times when Shadows of Luclin (the most recent
expansion) was released, and people found themselves desperately searching
for new drivers that worked with the daily patches. Things are somewhat
better now. Check out the everquestlive.com site for stuff that *generally*
works. The Tech Support board is helpful too.

The system you mention will be fine as far as performance is concerned in
the old world (= the base game).

Yes, any files that have been updated since your CD was created. Which will
be a lot of them, but none of the massive files (the zone files, which
Verant won't change because it would be too much to download).

> What are your thoughts on the basic game I ordered VS the upgrades?

Core functionailty is the same, you are in the same world (except only 3
continents), you can play all but two of the races (not lizard or catman),
you can play all but one of the classes (not Beastlord - I think?), plenty
of still-popular content in the old world. By the end of your free month you
will know whether you like EQ or not, at which point you can either quit
only $7.95 worse off, or resign yourself to a life of addiction =)

> How important are they?

For a year people did fine without any expansions, but Kunark in particular
is very popular for mid-levels. Velious is (still, I think) required for
some user interface enhancements, BUT a new interface for ALL subscribers is
due Real Soon Now. As you make friends in-game and advance in levels, you
might find yourself wanting to join them in places you cannot go, which
might be a pain. But as I've said, there's plenty to do in the old world.

If you DO get hooked, bear in mind you need to buy at least one expansion in
order to level past 50. The conventional guideline is that it takes a
first-time casual player a year to get to 50, so don't sweat this one too
much =)
