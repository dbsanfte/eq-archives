Note, that the blackburrow gnolls are allied with Bertoxx and Bertoxx
does control half of qeynos, hamstringing many of the efforts to root
out the gnolls, but the war has become open and widespread things may

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
