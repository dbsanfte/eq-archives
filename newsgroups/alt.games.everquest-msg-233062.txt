192.168.1.1 

If you obscured the prefix for privacy there is no need. That address
is private to your lan, can't be seen from the internet, and probably
a million others have the same one. :)

Right click on the lan connection .  The protocols are the ones with
the same 'wire' icon as tcp/ip.

You should probably just have tcp/ip.

You can try unbinding the QoS packet scheduler, and File and Printer
Sharing (which shouldn't be on anyways, if you are connecting directly
to the internet without a firewall)

But its probably not going to make much difference.

Beleive it or not, hooking up a router usually takes all of 5 minutes.

One setting that I've seen have an affect on this condition is  to
disable multicast pass-thru on the router. Give that a try, but again
I don't have a lot of hope for it. The other instance was quite
different a situation.

If you can locate a different/older firmware give that a shot.

Otherwise, I'd recommend just returning it and getting a different
brand. Its probably a firmware/compatibility  issue, and it will
probably get fixed, but its not worth your time to have to deal with
it.

Best if luck.
