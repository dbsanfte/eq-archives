	And that is only going to be true, ever, against raid-level mobs, which
were SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to require fighters to defeat.

	Against standard EP-grind mobs, the casters win, hands down.  The mobs are
dead long before the casters run out of mana and stop doing damage.

	But that's what the casters are doing when they complain that their DPS is
low: whining that they stand around a lot in raid encounters not dealing
damage in an effort to make themselves look weak.

	And you're including the inactive cycles.

	There is only one meaningful way to talk about DPS, and that is how much
damage/second you deal when you are dealing damage.
