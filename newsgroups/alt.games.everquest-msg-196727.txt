Yet if all characters are equally twinked/not twinked, they would be the 
obvious choice for tank. That's where the game dynamic is being altered.

That's my point. You've suddenly become the best option for tanking in 
addition to already being a healer, buffer, debuffer, crowd controller 
and dotter. There is a reason the best (intended) tank in the game has 
zero magical ability - balance. Every class needs tradeoffs. Massive 
twinking eliminates that.

I can see someone familiar with a class twinking the hell out of a new 
character in order to fly through the levels to get to the point of the 
game that is most appealing to them. Previous discussions here have 
enlightened me on that point. :) I'm just saying that it has some 
negative effect on other aspect of the game, not only for those who wind 
up not learning their class in the process, but also for those rendered 
unnecessary in given situations along the way.
