One...  I keep getting a message in the patch that says "Download size
exceeded for distribution"  or something like that... one for "Main"
and one for "Kunark."

How can I fix it, so I can get all the files I'm supossed to?  (I've
already tried the "complete file check," but I still get the above
messages.)


Two...   I just dinged 46 with my dwarven warrior.  I'm using a Centi
Longsword and a Wurmy.  Problem is, I keep losing stamina.  Are there
better weapons out there that can do the same or near the same amount
of damage (or more) and are *faster* weapons....  and won't cost me a
ton to get?  (I've only got about 2 or 3k in the bank right now.)

Thanks for any advice!
