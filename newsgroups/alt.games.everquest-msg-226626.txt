Let me rant a little.

I have done several LDON adventures now and every one, every one, I have
been forced to form my own group.

I dont even bother to shout "LFA" anymore. Its senseless. No one pays
attention to all the shouting.

There is either a distinct lack of IQ haunting the EQ waves these days, or
lack of leadership, or lack on initiative or lack of something.  People just
sit and scream out they are seeking a group.  The other day I saw some yutz
cleric shouting 55 cleric looking for group, while a guy was simultaneously
shouting 52-59 group LFG healer.  This went on for twenty minutes!  I'm like
WTF?

I have taken to just shouting "55 druid forming group at big tree - come
over and lets get into a dungeon FAST!"

Then after a couple more come and join (generally impatient sots such as
myself), I shout "55 druid and tank and mage as core of group that wants to
go into a dungeon FAST, who's in? Forget perfect groups, lets go! Go, go,
go!"

Usually I can get a group formed so much faster than these nimrods who
endlessly shout over each other. Give it up, buckos. Take a Carnegie course
or something.
