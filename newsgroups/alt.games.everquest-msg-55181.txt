Yup,
Computer Gaming World, you get the full version of the original game, no
expansions, and a crappy little manual(mostly just the basic stuff).  A
couple sessions in the game and you can pretty much learn how to do
everything anyways.

With that is a 10 day free trial and a CD key is on the back of the manual.
$9.89 a month after that.  Not a bad deal but it looks like your going to
have to supply C/Card info before the free trial and then it's up to you to
cancel if you don't like it.
Plus you probably want to get kunark anyways.  I've never played without it
so I don't know how much the interface may have changed when kunark was
brought out.  You'll be able to see the Iksar players but will not be able
to play them.

Hope that helps, I just got the mag today and from what I can see thats
about it.
