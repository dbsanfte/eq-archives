They said that the horses would be as fast as a skilled player.
What ever the hell that means. I am assumming it to mean the
lowest cost horse will  be as fast as a level 9 sow and the fastest
top end horse to be as fast as level 50 sow. I doubt they will be as
fast as a high level bard with decent drums however.

>  #2 Can a Horse be Sowed?

I seriously doubt it. Druids on horses would be rediculous then.

They have to be able to cast, Verant has basically said that you can do everything
you could normally.

Nope, they already said they will not be a separate entity.

All a horse is is eye candy with movement increase.

If you ever played D&D I think they are going to be like the old
Figurines of wonderous power. BAsically idols that summon magical
constructs to serve as steeds.
