Since your melee stats are maxxed when you're buffed anyway, i'd concentrate
on HP/AC/STA (which it looks like you're already doing a lot of anyway).

earring of the solstice, can usually pick up the stuff for around 6k.  maybe
mosquito leg earring if you're feeling saucy (not lore, take two!) ;)

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6334 doesn't look _too_
out of reach of you and your friends ;)  Might require a little faction work
though.  You guys could probably clear Kael a few times and pick up enough
toes and helms that you'd get ally in a day or two.

valorium rings.

spirit wracked cords if you feel like factioning/questing.

tae ew chain tunic.  seems to run anywhere from 12k-40k depending on server.

how often do you pull?  unless you're pulling often, i can't see a reason
for you to do ranged attacks when probably half your dps is going to come
from backstabbing.
