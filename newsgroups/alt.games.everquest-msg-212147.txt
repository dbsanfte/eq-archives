Well, yes but no not really.  If your STA stat is under 100 then a
drained stamina bar will slow your attacks a little and reduce some
of your stats, the drop in AGI could result in you being hit more
often.  OTOH, if your STA stat is 100+ none of these things happen,
the only effect is the inability to jump.

Now, somebody claimed during a similar discussion some months ago
that there is another effect of drained stamina bar on casters,
namely that it trashes your mana regen.  If this is true, and if
it cannot be mitigated with a STA stat of 100+, then there would
be some use for stamina regen for casters underwater (maybe just
toss Augmentation on 'em, it lasts a reasonably long time).
