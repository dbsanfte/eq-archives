Agreed, the point I was trying to make was that a druid always seemed
a lot more dependent on the group makeup. In camps where a shaman or
cleric that a shaman or cleric could hold as main healer with pretty
much any group, the druid didn't have that freedom. He'd need the
right support classes to make it viable (Chanter or Bard in most
cases, I'd say).
