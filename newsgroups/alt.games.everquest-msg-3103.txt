OK, I think we have a winner for Idiot of the Year.  Give me one, JUST
ONE, GOOD reason why you would even HAVE it in a combinable container?
Let me guess EVERYTHING else that your friend had in his bags took
more time and cost more money than his Quest Weapon?  

Or perhaps he was one of those who tweak the rules by using all
Tailoring Kits because of the weight.  

As one of my old GM's used to always say, "Stupidity is it's own
reward."
