    Or swallow! Boy, thinking about swallowing could REALLY bother someone!
And breathing! Once you start thinking about breathing, you start holding
your breath and all sorts of odd things!

    Me, I'm lucky. If someone says "don't think about
blinking/swallowing/breathing", I think about one, then the other two, then
about Greg Galbraith, the ninth grade English teacher I had that tormented a
class for an entire hour telling them not to think about those things. Then
I go on with my day as normal. :-)
