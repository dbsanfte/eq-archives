I agree with you.  Since this is a melee class that does not use mana
to use these "abilities" then I think they should be able to use these
abilities on the run.

Yes, this does annoy me a little bit.

You are not the first to make comparisons to Rangers.  As it is, the
people who play Rangers are a little miffed about the introduction to
this class because they feel the Ranger class has gotten the shaft
again.

I did not think you were trolling because a lot of people have been
making the same complaints.  I think it's an interesting class so far
but just about everyone feels that it's missing something. 
Personally, I'll continue to play the Berserker but I was hoping for
much more than this.

By the way, has anyone tried fear kiting with the Berserker? 
Berserkers get intimidation at 20 and combined with Leg Strike it
seems possible that fear kiting could be doable.
