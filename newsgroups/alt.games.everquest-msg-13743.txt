We're not fighting pixels ... we're fighting the server that generated the
pixels.

Look, if you're asking whether security on the internet is an issue, the
answer is yes.  That's whay I run a firewall and change passwords on
frequently used accounts every so often.  You post using Earthlink ... do
you suppose security is an issue for them? You betcha.

On the other hand, someone who would go through all the trouble you site in
your examples would have *much* better things to do with their time than to
scam my EQ password.  They would take my credit card numbers and go haywire
with them ... not play my lvl 7 wizard.

You're paranoid about this issue ... way over the top.  Are you still
munching on the food you hoarded for Y2K?

And ... oh yeah ... PLONK
