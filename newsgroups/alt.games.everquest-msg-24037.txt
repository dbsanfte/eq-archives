Well, they're directly on the way so they are kinda relevant and they
are *mean*. Was with a level 59 ranger friend and we had to scoot
run away fast.

I guess it re-emphasises the need to have someone show him the route
and not to wander though. And you DID say "not in any zone I've been in",
along with other reinforcements of the "no see invis" line, so you can
hardly blame others for bringing it up ;) Its not like you restricted *your*
statements to just being in Kael.

But back to the point; that passage is *not* obvious, I ran it three or
four times not paying a huge amount of attention following friends before
I did it on my own and I still got off track twice ;) 

That said, with sow and camo its pretty easy to get through before
camo drops and if it begins to blink there are a few stretches of corridor
that only have the occasional wanderer so you can stop and refresh there.

If you have a "camo item" with a long cast time mem the real version just
this once ;)

I have always skirted them as I've been told they are a problem, so this
may be one of those self perpetuating urban myths, I guess, but for 
informational purposes only I've always been told they are the ones 
in the corner to the right as you come out of kael (against the kael 
city wall and the moutain edge).
