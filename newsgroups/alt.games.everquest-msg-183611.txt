My face is still black but I have managed to get my BP Tint back to being
black (RGB of 5, Dyes can only go to RGB 25) after some playing about.
To reset all your armour tints you need to apply Dye of RGB 255 (if you were
to do this to a naturally coloured piece of armour it would not change the
colour at all) then Log out and back in (actually zoning may work here, I
didn't try it tbh) and your amour slots for that location will be as if no
dye had been applied, Cobalt blue, Tolans brown etc.

Again, the bug I had was that without applying any dyes to my character I
reset the Tint of my BP to be white. I had not applied any Dye to my chest
slot as I wanted to keep it black but even if I had, I did not hit save dye,
I hit Reset to reject the changes I made. I did zone with my, now silver, BP
and others saw it appeared Silver to all others. Anyway I got it back to
what it should be.

Now, to get rid of this sun burnt look on my face :ï¿½/
