If I worked at SOE and I had played the DAOC beta, I would not be
afraid at all. Eventually with progress some mmorpg I guess will be
enough better all around that it will steal a large share of customers
or most of them but DAOC is not it.

Besides that it is pretty much a coincidence. They talked up kunark
and even velious in the exact same way, especially just a scant few
months before release. They'd be talking up Luclin anyway and Luclin
and these things were certainly in the works way back when DAOC was as
vaporware as all the games you hear about now which are coming out
"some year."

You have to remember that verant takes 2 years to fix a very small bug
in one quest sometimes. All of these things they had planned eons ago
and work has been going on with them for a long time. Some of the
stuff is post Uber People velious adjusting also. When the most uber
of the uber have trouble in X area or can't do it at all, Verant then
says "wow this really is too hard and these mobs/resistences are too
high."
