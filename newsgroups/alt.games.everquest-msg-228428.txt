From the shadows, the mysterious 42 <user@example.net> (if that IS his
real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Exactly. And the problem is the game is then balanced for the
min-maxed template, making anything else undesirable.

As odd as it sounds, when the options are opened up like that you
usually end up with *less* variety, not more.

Oh you noted that too.

Well this 42 guy is right. :-p
