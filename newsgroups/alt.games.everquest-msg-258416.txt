-I- do.

Going with the flow of traffic is safest. Going notably slower than 
traffic is less safe.

For one thing you force hundreds of lane changes and passing as cars go 
around you, each of which is far less safe than everyone driving in a 
straight line in one lanel.

I wish police would ticket traffic weavers instead of people speeding 
(at the flow of traffic).
