I have having a better time of it - first time I setup and watch a few DVD's
I came back to the login screen - it was a server down/patch time. I stopped
playing at around 9pm last night and when I woke in the morning my faithful
little vendor was still diligently working away and had sold about 70% of
his inventory for the princely sum of 850pp... yeah, I know, I'm a peasant
but this was all stuff you can't normally give away on Stormhammer mind you.

I stocked him back up to 30 items before I left for work this morning, it
has been a lot of fun actually.

Things that sold like hotcakes were tailoring supplies (all types of hides
and silks) and generally very cheap items of the type even my 20's alts have
grown out of. People can't seem to pass up extra cheap stuff - even if they
are lame ie - blood crusted dirk and cloak for 5pp a peice : )
