Does it really matter how fast others open up the expansions?  Find
yourself a group of like-minded folks and take the expansions at your
own pace without regard to what the other guilds rushing through
content is doing.  Until you and your group/guild are done with an
expansion, maintain the self control to not visit opened expansion
lands or buy expansion items.

I never want to "beat" the content rapidly or have the best gear in a
month.  I would rather the developers give me content I can progress
through to spend my time on as opposed to giving me a key quest that
requires days and days and possible weeks of mind-numbing
camping/farming just so I can finally enter a zone...well...as long as
the other 60 people in my guild has dedicated those same weeks to
getting a key as well.  

This is yet another area(of MANY) where WoW has done it right and EQ2
has done it terribly wrong (I won't lump EQ in here, even though it's
guilty...it really had nothing to learn from like WoW did).  When EQ2
first came out, it was simply EQ with newer graphics.  The same lame
keying time sinks were there (for about every god damn zone) and  the
same place holder/named mob model was there(forcing you to kill ph
after ph for hours on end in the hopes the named would spawn..and then
hope that named gave you the quest update).  Sorry, but neither of
these timesinks are fun.

Developers that use the long time sink key quests, do so because their
game is lacking.  It's one of the reasons I quit EQ2 after just a few
months.  I couldn't take 5 god damn steps without hitting a zone I
needed to do yet another access quest for.  The dumbest of which was
for the Chamber of Immortaility.  Getting access for that little room
took many, many hours even if the randon number generator was
kind...and for what....all those hours to zone into a 2 room instance
that took you about 5 minutes to defeat for a quest update or two and
you never go back again.  Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, over.

Sure with WoW, I've had to do some keying/attuning for zone
access...but again they do it right.  They don't make you spend weeks
doing it...and shocker...I actually had some fun while I did it.  How
many people had fun farming shards for the VT key?  Not too many I'd
wager.

Lots of Ever, and not much Quest.  

I just don't understand why anyone would welcome or agree to forced
timesinks in a game.  Games are supposed to be fun (like WoW) not
mind-numbing job-like timesinks(like EQ and EQ2)

Hell I still remember my first experience with WoW(after I quit EQ2)
with a named mob.  I needed to kill the infamous Hogger for a quest.
Just as I ran up to the area he was in, I get there just as a group
killed him.  Coming from the EQ/EQ2 mindset I figured I had a nice
little wait coming before my chance to kill him again.  The group
asked me if I needed him and invited me to join.  I asked "You sure
you want to wait around for the next spawn".  They said "Sure, it'll
only be a few minutes."   I was blown away...a named spawn for a quest
respawning in a few minutes without having to kill 3 hours worth of
placeholders.  It was then I realized that perhaps WoW was focused on
the fun of doing quests and not the insane timesinkage of doing
quests.

Now it's 8 months of playing(off and on) later and I've yet find a
quest with a built in bullshit timesink who's only purpose is to delay
you in having fun.....which is basically what EQ/EQ2 was focused on.
(well that and to keep you away from end game zones that were
advertised as done, but weren't.....which is the real reason why some
of those BS timesinks they forced on people).

But hey, if you enjoy and welcome timesinks...have at it.  Me...well I
prefer finishing up my quests, moving on to the next one, and having
fun.
