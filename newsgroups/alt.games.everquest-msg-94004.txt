Obviously true.  Nothing is perfect.

Well, this poll took a lot more effort than entering a bogus price on 
Allakhazam.  (I *think* this is the one I participated in, the questions 
were very, very familiar.)

OK, so would you say that this represents an average sampling of people 
who play the game, and take it seriously enough to visit websites related 
to the game AND particpate in polls about the game?

Have you read the study?  It appears to be for a college or graduate level 
course, and I suspect that any professor would have already brought this 
issues up.  Now maybe I'm completely off base, but I strongly suspect that 
you are not a college professor, a statistician, or a polling expert.  You 
haven't even read the study (at least you hadn't based on your previous 
posts) yet you come up with all sorts of ways to tear it down.  What part 
do you dispute?  The fact that 16% of the playerbase is female?  Verant 
confirms that.  The fact that females are more likely to be active in 
and/or leading guilds?  Anecdotal evidence tends to support this.  The 
fact that the average player spends 22 hours a week playing?  Sony 
confirms that the average playtime is around 20 hours.
