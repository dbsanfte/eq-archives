Please forgive me if this has been asked before.

I am a musician and have greatly admired the music contained in EQ.  Has
anyone heard any word of a Everquest Soundtrack music CD being made
available.  Not just ripped wavs and mp3s and that crap, but a full-blown
complete, God (aka SONY)-sanctioned soundtrack.

Probably not, though.  From what I've read about creating music for video
games, the musician doesn't have to create an entire arrangment, just small
chunks that loop.  However, I also suspect that many of the songs originally
existed as completed works.  Then the musician and programmers selected
which parts to loop.

If any of the musicians that created the music for EQ read this group:
<applaud>.  And I would LOVE to hear any and all complete works you created.

Thanks.
