Nahhh.  From the time I posted my "Should I buy EQ" post until today (about
the Flame of Vox), every time I ask a question I get an accurate answer,
usually within minutes (and several times, from you re:tailoring <g>).

We tend to feed the trolls a bit too much for my liking, but hey ... to each
their own.  If there are folks who like troll-baiting, more power to 'em.
Sure, the occaisonal flamewar breaks out (it is Usenet, after all) ... I
just ignore the thread and go on about my business lurking and learning.

All in all, a pretty dang good place to relay stories and get your questions
answered, IMO. :-)
