Amazon.co.uk was one for sure.

I just went on www.google.com and did a search for pc games sellers for
england.  Most had Lucilin and Velious.  Amazon had a decent price though so
you might want to try there.

Also, a friend just told me that dvdboxoffice.com is good for games.  I
guess they do free airmail shipping anywhere in the world, and they have all
the everquest stuff.  I think thats where Ill get mine unless I find
somewhere more local.  Dvdboxoffice is canadian I think.
