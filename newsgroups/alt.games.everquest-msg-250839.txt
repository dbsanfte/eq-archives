I see your point... and I would equate Everquest to something akin to
say.. Windows. They use your updating philosophy with their naming
convention while adding features over time to a currently running
enviornment. Windows XP gets farther and farther away from Windows
95... and if you want a good idea of what the horror of a complete
engine change is... Microsoft had the same problems going from Windows
3.11 to Windows 95. It basically required a new rewrite and millions
upon millions of investment. They were, however, able to transition
their user base.. which made all the difference in the world.

My guess? Some suit told them to go live with it.

And really.. with suits.. until you grab ahold of their wallet and
twist they'll never listen. The company has sure done a 180 though..
and while it remains to be seen whether the corporate change holds,
the dx9 bug may be the best thing that ever happened to the game.

I completely agree.. calling it EQ2 is gay gay gay gay gay. There was
some bit from the summit meetings where the developers admit as much.
It would be nice if they came up with a decent name change that still
incorpoarted the name Everquest.

Completely agreed.

Yes. In the same way that people are now coming back to EQ after
trying out CoH. And once a new player works their way through the
grouping content of EQ2.. and is looking for more of a challenge.. the
EQ enviornment is the perfect transition.

>Sounds like now they need to update the EQ engine more than ever,

The EQ engine will continue to be updated and worked on.. there are no
two ways about that. It won't be replaced, but I don't think it needs
to be. And as it currently stands, Everquest simply has no competition
when it comes to the sophisticated raiding enviornment that it
supports. WoW would be the next logical choice.. but from what i
understand the end-game is either locked atm or non-existant so
whether it would even be competitive or look to simply hit the same
market as EQ2 is in question.

Yeah... i didn't particularly like the instancing of LDoN in a game
world view. The dungeons didn't feel like physical static places in
the world.. just generated content to mow through.

Yup. Not to mention the cookie cutter dungeons made from a base set of
templates.

That is by choice of the players. Everybody wants to twink and pl past
that stuff. However, It would be pretty funky if you could get an alt
guild started with the following rule

a) you can't buy gear, but you can get gear from a guildmate.

Then the members of the guild depend on each other to level, group,
and what not.

But most people would not see the point.

Yet they are there... and its the choice of the players if they want
to hit them with overpowering force, in level-equivalent gear, or not
at all.

Well.. it does seem they did put in at least one quest.. the oracle
quest that upgraded the old velious bp. But the main problem is.. even
for stuff like that it tends to be beyond your normal player because
it involves raid targets like Aramin the Spider Queen or outlaying
cash for the droppable item. As such.. i would suggest the follow-on
quest idea is good.. just utilitizing straight single-group content to
be able to finish it. The ring and shawl quests were good prototypes
for quests done by the average player.
