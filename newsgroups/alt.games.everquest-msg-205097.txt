So here's my latest tactic.

Summon and buff pet with Haste and HOS, buff self up with HOS and
stamina.

Pull mob with Slow, sic pet on it if resisted.

DOT mob with my best DOT.  Approach mob to engage if this doesn't
get it off pet; if I'm in melee range the mob -will- go for me
instead of pet (even if I've done nothing but Slow it)

Stand there, refusing to put attack on, and canni canni canni
while the mob impotently beats on me.  Stoicism myself as needed.

After mob dies, finish any canni/stoic needed to be FM and FHP,
repeat.

If there are multiple adds, getting all on the pet while I slow
generally works, sometimes I need to Stoicism the pet for this
plan.  I also use more than one DOT on the adds but not the one
the pet is actually meleeing (it will die too quickly for more
than one add).

If it gets really ugly, I root a mob, back up with anything else
thats on me, root something else, repeat until the mobs are
quietly waiting their turns.

Whats wrong with this story?  Well I did leave something out, and
its what makes this plan worthwhile.  I'm on Drogmor back the
entire time, with all my regen going.  By not attacking, I get
meditation mana bonus even though the mobs are beating me silly
all the while; thats same as having FT 20, or KEI plus POTG on.
And like as not I have KEI.  And I'm using canni II as fast as it
cycles, faster than cannidance.  Stoicism is dirt cheap for the
amount of healing it does, this is factored against the fact that
it snares me (fungal regrowth off my staff, which I have running
all the time does that anyway) and slows me... but I'm not
attacking!

Is it entirely without flaws?  No.  Pet can get into some real
trouble with multiple unslowed mobs.  Resisted slow seems to be a
bigger aggro than one that lands; sometimes I get into trouble
with multiple mobs on me.  Multiple unslowed mobs can deliver
enough interrupts that I can get buried, and if I don't recognize
that fast, drop stoicism -and- fungal regrowth and click insta
sow boots... well lets say its these moments I wish my cleric alt
was on a seperate account.

But despite having a pretty decent melee weapon (weighted velium
brawl stick) and self haste and melee stat buffs, my damage
output with the 49 poison dot plus sometimes the previous poison
dot is such that I'm better off generating mana as fast as I can
to cut down time than I am meleeing and throwing away all that
mana.

I've tried melee and using canni while doing so... turns out that
with such a small canni, I have to do it constantly which means I
really don't swing often anyway.  I suppose if a med cycle hits
while I'm casting canni I get the med benefit even though attack
is technically on.. or maybe not.  Really maybe not, as the
difference with my new not attacking plan seems quite palpable.

I also used this same plan with partners, a beastlord and a
monk.  Keeping aggro off the beastlord's pet was as easy as
keeping it off mine, but keeping it off the beastlord didn't
always work so well; I ended up using root and prox aggro
sometimes; on the other hand a hasted beastlord meant three
decent melee outputs instead of just the one.  Monk used FD a lot
to keep aggro on me, with slow and DOT and my pet generating
aggro for me, I could keep it for a while after each FD before
the hasted monk would steal it back.  Plus in either case, the
partner would get aggro from at most one mob, which they could
handle while I let the other adds beat me silly.

Between one thing and another, I did all of 49 yesterday using
this plan, much faster than my previous plan (of course this
includes the fact that I'm using 49 spells instead of 44 spells;
better DOT and better haste)
