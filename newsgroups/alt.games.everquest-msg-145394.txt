Only if you want to sell them most positions are worthless. But some are
necessary no Ogre or Troll would be allowed in a group if there was no way
for him to shrink. No players that need to go to Lower Guk without a means
of getting Invis to Undead. No person in their right minds would go to the
Plains without an emergency means of Gating. I have heard of people losing
all equipment by going LD and can't get back online till the next day end up
dying trying to get out.
