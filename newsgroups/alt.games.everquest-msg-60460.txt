I was wondering about this part as well. I have several boxes, one with
768MB, one with 1.5GB and one with 384MB. I only play on the 768 and 1.5
(both 512+), but I wondered what I would have answered if I had a 3rd
account for the 384 box.

They should have used questions like 16-64, 65-128, 129-256, 257-512, 513+.
Just to make sure everyone knows where he fits :)
