It doesn't work that way on the spell dispel, only on dragon dispel, spell
dispells take random buffs.

My buffing order went this way

See invis (crap buff off bracer of the hidden, always have it up)
Thorncoat (self only ac/ds)
Skin like Nature (ac/hp/regen)
Form of the Howler (wolf form + mana regen)
DMF (traded SoE+regen to a necro)
Endure magic (40 MR)
KEI (ported 60 enc for)
Chloroplast (less mana than regrowth, and it was mostly going to waste
anyways)

Siren opened with a 2-buff dispel that took Endure Magic and See invis, then
tashed me, then dispelled SLN and thorncoat, then started nuking me.  At one
point I managed to channel a heal with NO visible red on my HP bar, I ended
the fight at 97 hp.
