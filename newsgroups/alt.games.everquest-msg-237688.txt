I have other (non-free will-related) reasons for believing in God.

But, you're right; free will is just plain magic.  There is no logical
way I could possibly prove it exists.  Perhaps someone else can chime
in with some ideas.

Random or unpredictable?

Our grasp of QM is -- in my opinion -- so incomplete, unfinished, and
unrefined that I'm not yet willing to believe the universe plays dice
and that cause and effect can be broken by some true underlying random
element to the universe -- which seems just as magic to me as free will.
