Now wait just a damned minute.

My Paladin is level 51, and he's never been to the Planes yet
either (small guild, and haven't yet managed to hitch a ride with
a larger guild's planes raid), but that hardly means that I
never "went in a dungeon, learned proper group tactics, or
even talked to anyone".  Quite the contrary, in fact -- I'll
put my group skills and EQ knowledge up against anyone's.
But if one has never been to the Planes, one would clearly not
yet have had the chance to learn which are available with which
expansions.  And even asking around might not help, because most
people have Kunark and would respond, "well I can get to the Planes,
but I don't know if that's because I have Kunark, or everyone can
do it -- plus those sorts of questions are what this newsgroup
is for, asking here first doesn't mean the guy doesn't have
any friends.  Sheesh.

You're presuming a hell of a lot from a simple question,
Chrid.
