My Ye Auld Ball Peen Hammer used to fit in the range slot, giving me a +2
STR in a slot that isn't very useful to me. This morning, after getting
killed by a complete idiot of a partner, I tried to requip and found the
hammer unable to be equiped as I had intentionally equiped my spear and
shield first. Does anyone know if this was an intended change by verant. I
know this isn't a big priority item, but it is annoying for this to happen.
