Yes, it SPEAKS your ACCOUNT NAME and PASSWORD TO YOU.  You are bright
;)
It's kind of funny to hear comments like that after freely
distributing software with thousands of users for.. coming up on 3
years now for EQWatcher.  If you don't trust it, dont use it, I don't
care and neither does anyone else quite frankly.  Countless numbers of
people have used it behind their firewall software (ZoneAlarm, etc)
with no problems.

If you don't appreciate whats given to you, you might as well live in
France ;)
