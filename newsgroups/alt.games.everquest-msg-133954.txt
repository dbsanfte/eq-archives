I didn't say that BAOR will stack with POTG.  I said that
POTG doesn't overwrite BAOR any more.

Since BAOR + HB is superior to POTG (which conflicts
with both) I'd far rather keep my BAOR+HB combo.
Previously I had to disband out of group or run out of
group buff range or reapply my buffs whenever a high level
druid looked at my group funny.  Now he can cast his
POTG all he wants and I won't be bothered.

I didn't try killing BAOR and getting POTC, then
putting BAOR back, no.  Gosh, most situations I'd
much sooner have POTC + BAOR than
BAOR+HB.. unless there's a Mod2 mage handy,
at which point mana regen = joke versus HP for
modding up.  I doubt this works, though.
