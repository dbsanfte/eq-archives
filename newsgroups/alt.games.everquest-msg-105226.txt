Thats the official line, yes. And sometimes its even reasonable - the
aviak village springs to mind. Other times though....

How many times have you been in a cave, or tunnel, or hill somewhere
and had something whacking on you you just *cannot* see? 

Its fucking irritating, and it isnt making up for my "superior" 
intelligence.... Its just annoying. Cant do anything about it usually,
other than try and nuke it down and hope you dont get LoS issues,
or die.

>'sides, what are they gonna do, ban the mob?

ohhhh, I wish ;)
