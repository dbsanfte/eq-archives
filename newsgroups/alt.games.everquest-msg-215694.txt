You only need one Divine Rez cleric - for the final rez. Other than that,
a team of ten or so epic clerics in a "rez chain" could do the trick. A rez
a second should be quick enough to level back up.

Normal rez doesn't force a zone reload - in fact there's a very nice trick
where you can self-buff when rezzing yourself by summoning your corpse,
rezzing, then buffing yourself (and accept the rez while the buff is
casting) which can cut down on rez recovery time for the cleric. Medding up
for HoV in this fashion can be tremendously useful.

Does divine rez force a zone reload? I'm still saving points for it, so
I've never seen it done...

Yes, the domain is sad, but effective. :-)
