Quick question: My best friend, who roleplays as my character's brother on
Firiona Vie, has become extremely bored and disillusioned with EQ (as many
others have, yes). I myself have not, but since he's 99.9% of the reason I
play... Anyway, he's thought of trying Lineage II, but we don't wanna pay
$50 for the game without having feedback from people who have played it.
Anyone played it and have feedback for us about it that doesn't mind
sharing?

Thanks in advance.
