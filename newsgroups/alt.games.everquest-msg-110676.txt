Try reading some of his own writing, or the speaches he himself wrote.  Try
listening to his candid talks.  It's the standard democratic policy to
portray the republican as unintelligent, but it really doesn't pan out.  Oh,
and if you want sheer intellect, then Carter and Clinton are your top
presidents, for all the good it did them.

The consumer gap could never overspeed the economy.  It existed as a side
effect of the missle gap.  Communist countries find they have only so many
resources, and if they're diverted to one thing, everything else suffers.
As it turns out, we drove them past where they could keep up with even that
which they concentrated on.  On the other hand, the US economy was growing
out of stagflation at the time.  The recovery from '70 to '83 is not
something revisionists like to concentrate on, but it was real (trust me, I
was there).  If you don't think Reagan was responsible for this, please
explain why.

My consideration is that pure capitalism puts the responsiblity for their
lives in the hands of the people.  I don't want to live in a nation with a
nanny government, as once the state starts thinking for the people, they
forget how to think for themselves.  Statism is what gave rise to Communism,
Fascism, and National Socialism.
