I usually fish while waiting for a boat to come...
As soon as the boat is here, I hop on the boat, drink until It says I
couldn't possibly drink anymore, and start to fish again while the
boat is in transit.

The first time I did this I had a fishing skill of about 5 or so, by
the time the boat ride was over my fish skill was about 25.

I drink and fish on corpse runs now all the time, especially if it's a
long run to my corpse, or I have to take a boat.

(I know the above is almost completely irrelevant, but I had to put my
2cp in :)

Just an off topic question, how many people here (besides me of
course) like to go REALLY drunk right before a corpse run, because it
makes you feel liek your moving alot faster.

I've always called this effect DSow or Drunken SoW :)
