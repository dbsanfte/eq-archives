This may be a good arguement when considering those musical artists who 
have talent, but unfortunately "talent" does not quite fit when you're 
talking about produced puppets like the Spice Girls, most of the boy 
bands, Britney Spears etc.

To me this music is just a string of simple notes thrown together in a 
nursery rhyme fashon and finished off with upbeat pop synthesis to make 
it danceable and sound happy. Throw in a few lyrics like "love" and 
"baby" (making sure they rhyme a little), pick your favourite pop puppet 
to sing them (send them to the gym, get them a makeover and dancing 
lessons first) and hey presto you've got yourself a No.1 hit for a month 
or two. Describing them as "artists" is very generous indeed.

So, considering how this music is manufactured its easy to understand 
how some don't consider making copies of this music without paying 
royalties as theft. Who you're really "stealing" from is whatever record 
company came up with the marketing for the one hit wonder in question. 
Sure technically it may be stealing from these record companies, but as 
we've seen in this thread, most people don't have much sympathy for big 
record labels anyway.

I guess it comes down to how much you respect the person(s) who put in 
the effort and expense to produce the music.
