Ahh .... Sword of vengeance do thee speak ?  I have not but quarrel with
such noble charge , but may I quote from passage thus " When valor preys on
reason, It eats the sword it fights with. "  .  Is this not to thy own
demise ? A query if I may , If one doth cast <not> thine eyes <from> the
sun, are thee not blind for sure ?  Me thinks thy blade hath dulled by use ,
warding for thy vengeance . I once again shall proffer , come to me my
troubled son , I shall not berate you as have some . Battle tis all but lost
for mine enemies .  Would thou be one more hand that covets thy staff ?
