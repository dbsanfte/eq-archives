    I've been out of EQ for a few months (since early February) and have
been thinking about starting up a new character since they've just made the
earlier part of the game much quicker.
    I've thought about being a caster of some kind.  I've thought about
cleric possibly.  What ever it is, I've got a few things I'd like though.

1 - learningness)  Easy to play/learn for someone who's only played a druid
and SK (for casting types).
2 - usefulness)  I'd like to be needed in higher levels as well (balanced
amount of neededness from 1-60...in other words not as much more needed but
becomes less needed or less needed but becomes more needed, I'd like it a
little more even throughout all LVs).
3 - size)  I'd prefer medium size (unless I can be convinced otherwise).
Its much harder to find armor for small or large characters, and large is
too big in some areas, so no Ogre or Troll (or even Barbarians are a little
large).
4 - fend for themselves when needed)  Can solo some (not always, but just
enough for being able to get around from area to area without someone
else...solo enough to maybe take on ONE thing at a time if just passing
through and spot it...I prefer group though).
5 - {minor one} newbie quests)  What good newbie type of quests are there
for the specified class/race?  Some of the ones I liked were the polar bear
pelt for leather armor Halas quest, the Iksar Monk shackles quest, Iksar
Monk armor quest (where you fill that bag with that item and hand it in at
VERY low LVs).  Some quests which can help get me my first armor and few
plat to buy my spells with.  I've got alts, but I prefer not to twink, and
when I do I always pay them back the few plat with interest later on (and
only had to do this twice).

    This is all I can think of at the moment.  I'd appreciate any helpful
info on which class and race for that class would best fit the above areas.
(Cleric, Mage, Enchanter, SK, any others anyone can think of, and the races
which are best for each).
