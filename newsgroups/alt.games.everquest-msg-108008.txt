They didn't actually remove the hybrid penalty, they just give a 
multiplier to compensate for it.  I'm a Wood-elf bard, so I used to have a 
40% exp penalty.  In other words, it took 1.4 times as much exp for me to 
gain a level as it did for a High-elf Cleric.  If it took the Cleric 
1million exp to get a level, it would take me 1.4million.  
Verant eventually realized that class exp penalties were unfair for a 
number of reasons (especially the way that a Troll SK took over twice the 
group exp that an equal level Halfling Warrior would take), and removed 
the class penalties.  They didn't actually change the numbers, they just 
added a bonus to the exp number before it was credited to the player.
Say that a random mob gives 10,000 exp, and the cleric needs 1,000,000 exp 
to get through their current level.  I, as a bard, am the same level as 
the cleric, get the same 10,000 exp for the kill, yet need 1,400,000 exp 
to complete the level.  In other words I need to kill 1.4 mobs for every 
one that the cleric kills.
The way that Verant fixes this is to just add 40% to all exp it awards me.  
I solo that 10,000 exp mob, I get the kill, the game sees that I'm a bard, 
and awards me 14,000 exp.
It works in a similar way for group exp.  The exp bonus for a 2-person 
group is what, 4%?  Assuming 4%, the cleric and the bard join forces, kill 
the 10,000 exp mob, get the 4% bonus applied, so now it's 10,400 exp, and 
divide the exp, for 5,200 exp for both characters.  The game engine awards 
5,200exp to the cleric, but awards 7280 exp to the bard, because it gets 
the 40% bonus to counter-act the 40% penalty.  It now takes exactly the 
same number of kills for classes to level (ignoring the warrior bonus), 
though there are still racial exp penalties.
