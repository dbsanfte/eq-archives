    There is no "default", per se. In most newbie zones, ZEM = 100. In most
non-newbie outdoor zones, ZEM = 75. In most dungeons, ZEM = 85. In most of
PoP, ZEM = 145. There are many, many exceptions to these "mosts". If we were
talking about strictly the original game, I'd say the default was 75, with
zones deemed worthy of extra XP being at 85 or 100. That would be true for
most of the original game zones, before stuff started getting tweaked.
Because of the values of the ZEM being what they are, I'd argue against
re-interpreting the formula as (1+zem)x75x..., though. Especially with the
way the EQ engine truncates fractions.

    Then I apologize for my statement. It looked like you were, but I was
wrong. And nice program. =)
