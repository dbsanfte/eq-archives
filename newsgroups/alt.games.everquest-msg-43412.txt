You're totally screwed. You may as well cancel your account now, buy a
new CD and start over.

No...... as others have mentioned, don't worry unless you're an Iksar,
in which case it's still fixable. However, particularly if you picked a
fighter type, I personally feel that *any* AC points are better than
none, so turning in the note as a true newbie with no characters/cash to
twink yourself up, is still a good idea. However, if you're level six,
you've probably run across some tattered leather armor by now, so I
wouldn't worry about it.
