The problem I and many have had is Directx8 games don't run and the fix is
to go into DXdiag, under the Display tab, disable and immediately renable
Direct3d Acceleration(and to check it, just hit the test button).....BUT, if
you haven't set the dll to 8 in the eqclient.ini, this shouldn't effect
you...
