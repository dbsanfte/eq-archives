Wanting to... sure... but this appears to go beyond casual desire.

Perhaps 'gang' has too many negative connotations, but I'm specifically 
directing my comments at the whole fixation on displaying a tag to be 
analogous to wearing the colors.

At any rate working together, socializing, having common interests or 
goals etc has nothing to do with fixation to showing off your 
association. One does not imply the other.

Sure many (most even) clubs and associations have logos and what not you 
can get on shirts/jackets etc. But one does not join the PCA with an eye 
towards getting a logo jacket.

It sounds like the OP has placed far more importance on getting his tag 
to show than he has on actually doing anything interesting things with 
his guild.

And so I asked why he cared. That was a mistake. I should have asked why 
he cared *so much*.

I understand wanting to display your membership. I don't know why he 
feels compelled to endlessly do something he doesn't want to do -just- 
to display his membership.

/shrug

I don't really care on this point.

Personally, I don't particularly want to see your guild tag at all 
times, its unnecessary screen clutter, and as likely as not would have 
any feature to allow me to hide yours enabled.

At any rate being able to display your tag must be one of the lowest 
level and easiest guild achievements to obtain, I highly doubt an active 
guild would really even have to *try* to keep this up.

In fact on some level, its a clever way of separating the dying/dead 
guilds from the living ones. I have alts in EQ1 guild tagged in guilds 
that don't exist anymore except as a dozen forgotten alts on various 
accounts. Perhaps when I log them on, that guild tag shouldn't be on 
display.
