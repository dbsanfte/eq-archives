I've never actually seen him... which, of course, didn't stop him from 
killing me in less than a second. :) Hmm.  I rather thougt Kardakor was a 
dragon sent to watch over the wurms... But I think I thought that on the 
basis of this text, that, now that I reread it, is not all that clear:

You say, 'what is the patrol?' 
                   
Ralgyn says 'Ah yes, the patrol. Well in the Great 
Divide there is a collection of caves that the dragonkind
holds as a sacred territory. For this reason we always 
have a number of our strongest up and coming
younger ones train there with the great [Kardakor]. 
They patrol the caved labyrinth to make sure it is free
from unwanted intruders who are quickly dealt with upon 
discovery. 

You say, 'who is kardakor?' 
                   
Ralgyn says 'Kardakor is a strong and powerful Warrior. 
He has fought in many battles against the vile
Giants and is well respected amongst our people as a 
champion. For this reason when one was needed to
train our young fighters seeking guidance in developing 
both their magical and fighting techniques it was
clear to us who we should select for this honor, 
Kardakor.

Hrmph.  So how do we define the difference between a wurm and a dragon?
Breath weapon? Wings? How big a guild it takes to kill it? 
CoV/RoS/Vox/Nagafen faction hits?
