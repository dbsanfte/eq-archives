Having just started up a monk, I would like the monks here to answer
this question.  Any monks out there?

As a newbie monk, I try to carry all 3 hand held weapon types all of
the time to work up the skills.  This can quickly use up just over
half my weight limit.

Then I find the need to carry bandages and throwing items to work up
those skills.  Since I'm major kos everywhere, I have to carry a bulk
amount of these supplies with me, which means I have to carry multiple
bags.  4 vendor purchased bags are 12.0 weight right away, which is
enormous.

So right away, I find myself overweight and naked with no room for
loot.  What's the secret?
