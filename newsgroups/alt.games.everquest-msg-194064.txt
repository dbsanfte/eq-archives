Run 3 and Regeneration are the only really useful abilities you can buy at
52.

For the three resists, they're *so* much cheaper to find elsewhere, that
you're spending a lot of experience on a tiny gain.  Honestly, when you have
a song that boosts those three resistances by what, 120 - 150+ each... how
much difference is an extra 2 points going to make?

Once you have Regen and Run 3, I'd save up the max number of points (30) for
the useful abilities at 55...  then stamina maybe, if you're out of saving
room and still needing a place to put them.
