I think this was all about guild cohesion and loyalty. Your guild, if worth 
a snot, should have no problem putting in the time to get you flagged. If 
you're not guilded, it *should* be a bear to get to some of the high end 
content. EQ is a group-oriented game and the content is geared toward 
coordinated approaches.
