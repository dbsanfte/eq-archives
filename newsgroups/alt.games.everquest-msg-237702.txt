That is the weirdest thing I've ever heard, since many people would
tend to believe the opposite. If God doesn't exist, then there is
absolute free will since nothing you ever pray for would ever have
more of a chance of happening. Why you'd say that free will equals God
existing is beyond me and I'm a Christian.

What a very odd thing to say.
