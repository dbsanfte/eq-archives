Yeah? So?

Guildies talk... or is yours that quiet?

Doesn't mean you didn't either. Still doesn't discount what I've seen and 
heard.

I don't have to be in a 55+, etc. group to know what goes on in them. I 
have guildmates and they talk. BTW my ex-wife's char has a 65 cleric and I 
still talk to her too. If we were talking tactics here I'd conceed your 
point. But we're not so I won't.

Well they've been in pickup groups as such. And they do talk about it. So 
because I don't see it FIRSTHAND my comments are pointless to you? Grow up.

You must also take WAY too many hallucinogens.

Go for it.  Call it Shitonashingle.. makes no difference to me. Remember 
I'm not uber (or ubah, or oobah, or etc.), so I could really care less.
