Sure. Agreed even. But CTS clickfests aren't a 'taste' thing like 
roleplaying is... tedious CTS clickfests would only appeal to a 
masochist. Its not unreasonable to assert with some confidence that 
there are few who enjoy that aspect of the game, regardless of who my 
social circle is.

Why would that fail to suspend your disbeleif?

Couldn't the hours of actually banging things together be abstracted... 
if I read a book and it says the character just spent four hours doing 
something my disbeleif wouldn't suddenly come crashing down because the 
book didn't belabour everyminute of it.

If after doing the quest the tradeskiller says now go make 3 of these 
and after your 3rd attempt you'd skill up... that would do it for me. 
Making me do 40 or 50 more tedious attempts just belabours the point.

Even EQ has follwed this route elsewhere...why don't wizards have to go 
sit in isolation in a tower for a game year or two at a stretch to learn 
a new spell....  that's far more realistic than killing mobs until you 
suddenly level, and magically qualify to learn a new selection of spells 
provided you can afford various scrolls, and everyone accepts that model 
without question, and relatively little complaint...at the very least: 
no one is pushing for more lock-me-up-in-a-tower time.
