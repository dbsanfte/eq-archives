Check your bios settings etc and AGP aperature especially.  I had issues
with some Nvidia upgrades where I didnt' set something in the bios the
way Nvidia wants it set.

So I would suggest re-reading all of the install information from Nvidia
and making very sure you did *everything* the instructions asked.

Other things to check would be a) are you sure your memory is working
and b) you have enough in-case cooling?
