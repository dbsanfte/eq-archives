Ok. I'll give you the General *himself* being an easier fight once you
get him alone. However, I have seen a number of wipes on General raids.
(At least when we first started doing him a year or so ago). And it was
always while we were trying to pull the rest of the DE's and clear the
area.

Fay, however, is a pretty easy fight once you get the hang of it. Her
AoE is fire based and very easy to resist once you get a decent resist
kit and the right buffs. Melee damage is a joke. The only hard part with
Fay is learning to not let her ping pong. If you can keep her pinned
down in one spot, with the MA holding her attention, the fight is fast
and clean. If she leaves the MA and immediately starts zooming around
amongst the casters, you're in for an ugly CR.
