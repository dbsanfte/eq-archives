: an someone explain the term 'twinking' please, as a newbie I fasil to

If a character has far better items than he should have at his/her
level, given to him/her by higher levels etc .. that's what is
called twinking. Many envious people like to bash twinks. I love
to total ubertwink my alts and just mow through yellows and
reds at my level. Most people don't udnerstand, that I had
to bring my main to 60 by myself. Actually, I don't care what
most people think about that :)
