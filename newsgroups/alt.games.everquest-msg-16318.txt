> Have you ever seen anyone with two last names in the game?

Yes.  Saw one last nite.  It surprised me.  And it was not a GM as far as I
could tell.  I have heard that they have been handed out for winning GM
events.  Unfortunatly as I was typing in my question to ask how they got the
name, they logged.
