And here you're claiming *they* are harsh...   They're just not going to
give the individual loot.  You're going to kick him out completely.

They made a choice.  They knew the policy going in, and agreed to it.   If
they later decide they have other things they want to do instead, that is
their choice as well.   In each case, they should accept the consequences of
their own decisions.

First, bullshit.   They are not in any kind of limbo unless they choose to
be.   They always have the option of leaving and joining a different guild,
which is more accommodating to their schedule.

Second, how is being told you that you can no longer hang out with and raid
with your friends, even if that is what you want, a *more* positive
situation?
