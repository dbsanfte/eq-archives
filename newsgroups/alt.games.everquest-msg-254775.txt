Yes, but throw in the fact he's red to the OP and starts with a HT, it
doesn't fit the OP's criteria of  "something I can take for extended periods
of time". He may be able to take him if he used his main weapon skills, but
I doubt if he'll get any skillups at all on his neglected ones before he has
to head to zone line.
