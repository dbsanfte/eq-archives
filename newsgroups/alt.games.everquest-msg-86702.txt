    Buff the cleric to unbelievable levels, including a damage shield. Go
where mobs are high yellow to barely red to the cleric, and undead-like
(mobs that fight to the bitter end - no runners). Have the cleric nuke to
pull, then try to make sure he hits everything at least once before it dies
on the damage shield. The big key is NO RUNNERS - make sure the mobs will
kill themselves on that damage shield. As the PLing progresses, the cleric
should practice spell skills on their own time.
