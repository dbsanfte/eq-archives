Get a Linksys Cable/DSL Router.

It will give you the following:
1. DHCP Services for all of your PCs. 
2. Limited firewall protection
3. 4 10/100 ports (You can add a hub and extend to many more)

I use one with my Cable modem connection. Here is how it works.....

Cable Modem----->Linksys Router
(Router recieves it's IP address from Cable company)

Linksys Router----->3 PCs 2xWin98SE 1XWin2KPro
(The Router acts as a DHCP server assigning an IP address to each PC
when it boots up.)

The router splits the bandwidth between the 3 PCs and you do NOT have
to use a proxy or internet connection sharing. You setup the router
through your web browser. It is EXTREMELY easy to setup, and works
like a charm.
