Your right - I think the problem is that the work us Necros do in a
group is not spectacularly visible - we don't have any significant
buffs, heals, mana gens or anything - we don't have spectacular Nukes
so people don't readily see what we are up to, however, with the big
DOTs we have - which can be stacked - along with a reasonable pet
plugging away - we do actually provide a big contribution.
