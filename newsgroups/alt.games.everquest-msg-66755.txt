Yeah, I've got this on occasion too on Antonius Bayle. In fact, I'm reading 
this newsgroup now because I've quit out of EQ to escape the 'lag'.

It isn't so much lag as horrible stuttering framerates, my lagometer shows 
no packet loss or high ping or anything. Just everything is jerky as hell 
in Upper Guk (no other zones) as if I was on a big raid with loads of 
casting going on and sparkly bards running around me. I've even tried 
turning spelleffects off in UGuk, to no avail. It can happen with only 1 or 
2 people in the zone, so I don't think that's the cause anyway. I've heard 
others complain of it in-game too.
