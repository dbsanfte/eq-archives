Of course the fact that Sang K Choe is about as a highend level player
as you can get means that he does have some right to be blunt with
people who are spouting off nonsense.

Also since you are apparenly new to the game it may be worth your time
not killfileing people who know what they are talking about, but
listening to them instead.

Finally welcome to news groups if you have problems with "idiot" and
"bullshit" (Used correctly in context I may add) then you may have a
problem living here. Mark my words posts like your one above will mark
_you_ as a troll, then you must fear the wrath of many of the regulars.
(I hate to mention Biz only since every one is having a go recently,
even Lokari can be strict on ocasions :-)

It would be nice if everyone could live in peace and have constructive
discussions, but sometimes people are just plain wrong and need to be
told so. Chill Scott, it is called reality.

(Notice no cussing or put downs)
