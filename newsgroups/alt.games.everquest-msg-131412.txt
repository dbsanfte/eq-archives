I have had 2000 Pro for a while and to be quite honest have not had any
problems with it. Historically NT machines are very stable while they're
"personal" versions (win95, 98) are considerably less stable.

The slowness you refere too (to me on a P3 866 384MB RAM) is not even
noticible. I am able to play EQ and many other "high-end" games with no
performance issues. You can tune the QoS services to help if you are
experiencing performance issues.

All in all FLEE FROM WINDOWS 98 and WINDOWS ME!!
