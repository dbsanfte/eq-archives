I think I'm right in saying that the skill cap for palladin is (LVL x
5)+ 5 , whereas it's (LVL x 4)+ 4 for clerics?  Can someone confirm
this?

Also cap pre 50 is 175 for clerics and 200 for palladins ... post 50
only palladins can increase further, to 225 (ouch! thought they capped
at the same level as warriors, 250, until I checked that).
