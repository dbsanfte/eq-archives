I suppose it all boils down to how out of whack the name is... There is 
a lot of humour in fantasy, and EQ, while not Terry Pratchett, it's 
certainly not po-faced High Fantasy in the Tolkien or Eddings mould. I 
reckon it's somewhere around Steven Brust in the humour/seriousness 
scales, so while "Biiilllbo" is out, I had no problem with a Dwarf 
called "Thror" (grandfather of Thorin in "The Hobbit"), and while 
"Keermittt" would make me want to puke, a Froglok called "Xenopus 
Laevis" or "Rana Rana" would only elicit a smile.
