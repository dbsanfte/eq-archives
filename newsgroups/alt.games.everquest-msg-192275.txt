From an earlier post, many spells that use components were discussed.
take a look below to get a general idea of what it costs beyond mana
for the caster.

-----------------------------------------------
Spells that use components:
-----------------------------------------------
Clerics Symbol Line including Aego+
lvl14 Symbol of Transal - Cats Eye Agate
to
Blessing of Aegolism uses 4 dots.
Ancient: Gift of Aegolism is a 2-dot version of BoA. Hideously
difficult to
get however.
Group Symbol uses a single dot, I believe.
Turns out Naltron's Mark uses one dot, Marzin's Mark uses three dots,
Kazad's mark uses two dots. Hand of Virtue also uses two dots.
Death Pact, level 51 IIRC, uses a pearl. Divine Intervention, the
level
60 spell, uses emeralds. Death Pact is weak, DI is a staple at the
high end.

Wizard Translocate:  Small Portal Fragments 1pp per TL
Destinations that DON'T cost a Gem:
	North Karana
	Greater Faydark
	Dreadlands
	Toxxulia Forrest
	Nexus
	Great Divide

Druids Stop Rain song: Wake of Karana costs a Opal

Enchanters Rune Serie
Rune 1 - Cats Eye Agate
to
Rune 5+ - Peridot

Banishment Series (instakill) Mage and Druid - Star Ruby

Call of the Hero - Perl

Sacrifice (Kill Player for Necro-Rez) - Emerald
Convergence (Necro Rez) - Essence Emerald
Trucidation a 1Kish tap  - Essence Emerald
Infusion, 1K mana to self - Essence Emerald

Conjure Corpse (Summon Corpse) - Tiny Jaid Inlaid Coffin
That's the high level body summon.

12- Lesser Summon Corpse - uses the black ceremonial coffin- and only 
works on bodies of folks 35 and under. These are giant size and non 
stacking.

39- Summon Corpse - uses Jade Inlaid Coffin - the container. Works on 
any corpse to level 60.

58 - Conjure Corpse - uses stackable tiny jaid inlaid coffins. Works
on 
anyone. Velious and POG necro robes have this as a right click effect.

Shaman: Avatar - emerald

Beastlord: Ferocity - peridot

Levitate - various classes uses up a Batwing

Enduring breath - various classes uses up a Fish Scale

Mage Phantom armor line (self only) uses 1-4 cats eyes depending on
level of
spell.

Mage pet spells use a Malachite.

Necro pet spells use a bone chip.

Necro pet spells level 59 and up also consume a peridot.

All the enchanter 'enchant' mana spells use gems from pearl to ruby
depending on level.

Many priest classes can imbue gems to be used in various trade skill
armor.
