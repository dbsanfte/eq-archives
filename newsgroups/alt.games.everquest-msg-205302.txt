Lol, yeah.

My ISP newsgroup stopped working a while back, so i found a free one on the
web.  This worked pretty good until a few days ago, then I started getting a
"you do not have permission to talk{}" message.

So I found another free one, a crappy one that misses 65% of posts (and
apparantly makes the same amount of people miss mine)
Now im waiting for another "free" one to reply to me, as their registrtion
is a manual process.

My NG is teh sux0r atm =(
