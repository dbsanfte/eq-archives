Oh come on guys...gameplay

Graphics are a relative expectation based on currently technology.

Let me ask you this: When you were a kid, how many games did you play (make
up) with a tennis ball?
Did you have fun? How hi tech was that tennis ball?

What about this: Gameplay == <-PLAY a GAME-> and that is exactly what you
want to do.

I still have computer games that I play from 15-20 years ago that are way
more fun (and challenging) than some of today's latest and greatest. i.e.:

Loderunner
Choplifter
Aztec
Drol
...
(hmm who can guess what machine these are from. (If you do you are showing
your age!))

Games should be fun, not just pretty. When I buy a new game, I want to have
fun, not play a technology demo.
As a previous poster put it: Good graphics are just icing on the cake.
