I know its probably an exploit, but I've been begging for this
fix for so long that I'm going to pretend its "working as
intended" until told otherwise.

Cast cleric pet (which requires an NPC target, or the thing
suicides instantly) and it fights until it or the target is dead
(or mezed), then returns to its master and kills itself.

Its possible to keep the pet alive indefinately by running away,
since the pet has to stop moving to consider suicide.  This is
difficult but not impossible to master, if you have some run
speed enhancer (TBoots/JBoots, SOW, SOE, Selo's, Run 1 2 3) so
you can outdistance the thing... but not too far or it will give
up the chase, stop, and oh yeah, I'm supposed to die now.

If you are attacked by another mob while the first is alive, the
pet will move to that target after the first stops being a target
(by dying or getting mezed).  Its possible to keep a pet alive
indefinately by making sure there's always a "next target" for it
to go to.

With a combination of the above two, I once cleared out every
goblin in SolA by myself with a single pet.  Long before the cast
cost reduction on the pet, long before the melee enhancements for
clerics... but mainly yes, I was that bored hunting my dang epic
part in there.

However, yesterday I discovered something new.  If my pet gets a
haste, it no longer wants to kill itself.  I got VoG on the
little bugger and he hovered around me like a chanter pet.  With
care (meaning keeping him from hitting Enrage, which is his only
real weakness) I was able to keep one alive till I got the
message "VoG Fades on Jobartic" whereupon he poofed.

Why do I care about this?  Well for one thing I've always been a
mad cleric pet user.  I used the thing when it cost 600 mana to
cast.  I wear an enshrouded veil to bring the cast cost down.
Pet was a big "push to 54" goal for me, in fact.  For another,
the pet is, unlike the druid pet, actually a worthwhile tool in
hunting higher level mobs, he does real noticable damage.
Particularly when melee soloing, the pet is almost essential.

But one problem has always bugged me with the little guy, he's
suicidal, so its not worth buffing him up.  He has 100 hp, and
realistically he's not going to get any more, even though my
class is the king of HP buffing.  This has always seemed a slap
in the face to me.  Further, his utility, unbuffed, is quite
limited, he can't be relied on to kill even deeply green mobs by
himself, with so few HP, they grind him down.  Give him Aego,
though, and he's quite capable of chewing up greenies with
relatively little love and care from me, particularly since he
also has the other buff I've always wanted for him, haste!

I'll particularly love killing dragons with him, since he's
immune to their AE... I've cast him on a few lower boss mobs in
the past where we had a serious overkill situation and there was
no way my couple seconds cast time or 180 mana expenditure was
going to be the deciding factor.  But now, as long as I can get
in a fight with some other mob in the zone beforehand to set him
up, he's going to be there for every battle where pets are
permitted... at least until someone explains why not to me using
small words.
