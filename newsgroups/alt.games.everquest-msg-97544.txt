I don't see the spellbook as making anything harder or easier.
Its just annoying. Plain and simple. I pay 10 bucks a month I want
to be able to look at a 'little' more that a static screen.

Staring at the spellbook added NOTHING but annoyance to the
game. Always hated it from day one and never understood how
such an idiotic game design decision even made it into a game.

BTW if the people that hate the spellbook are in such a small
minority why are they making the change at all? I put to you that
the majority of people hate the spellbook, not the other way around.
