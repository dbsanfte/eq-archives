    So have I. The shaman gets a lot of grey hairs, but it's more than
doable. I've been the only healer for a warrior-monk-cleric group in Fire
near zone in, and kept up with the pace with ease, so I would not be
surprised that a shaman with better healing efficiency over time could do
it. With a shaman the only critical points are crowd control must be taken
care of, and aggro must be controlled as well. But as long as those two
conditions are met, a shaman is more than capable of being primary healer
for an elemental group.

    This is a junk item off one of the one-groupable nameds in Water. We
have to give it away via /random, and have since the first two were awarded.

    The proc is about average to slightly above average in frequency. So not
a lot of DPS from the proc. Guess the shaman's pet, pet AA, and other
offensive weapons (epic, possibly elemental chain pants, etc.) need to pick
up the slack.

    On our raids that's what they keep memmed standard, too. Outdoors one
will usually have Bih'Li memmed, and there's usually one shaman that has AGI
memmed as well. It's mostly a matter of spell slots.

    The reduction is quite substantial. As Martin said, you can see it
visually - the mob will go from rampaging/flurrying on every swing, or every
other swing, to once every 20 seconds or so. It's nice to see Cripple land,
as it stops the red spam. This is on raid mobs, by the way. I've yet to see
an XP mob that rampages or flurries enough that cripple would be useful.
