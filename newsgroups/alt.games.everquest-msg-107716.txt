I can't imagine starting EQ on a PK server, it must make the
sometimes difficult learning process, even harder. Lake of
Ill Omen is a great zone for 15-30, but you are right in
guessing it will be loaded with people (and bad people, in
particular). If you want unpopulated zones, I would
recommend:

Kerra Ridge
Stonebrunt Mountains
Qeynos Hills
Western Karana
Lavastorm Mountains
Najena (indoors, but dungeon bonus)
Befallen (indoors, dungeon bonus)
Warrens (indoors, bonus)
parts of Lake Rathe
Everfrost
possibly parts of Southern or Eastern Karana
