That is in the group of url's for classes

Just need a bit of clarification here.

I understood that to be a PK, you had to be on a PvP server. It's possible
to indulge in PvP on any server, but on a non-PvP server it has to be in the
form of a consenting duel.

Is this correct?

Any care to write this, I am a little unclear on it myself.

Corpse recovery strategies may be a little too detailed for this. Same goes
for /assist.

How about;

What happens when I die?
How do I join a Guild?
What are the Planes and how do I get to them?

Any offers to write them?
