A number of dkp systems put minimum values on an item, and will not let 
people buy the item without spending that many points. Lets say all the 
rangers present have that uber bow now, and the warrior is marginally 
interested in picking it up for the extra 10hps it will give him... but 
its not worth 100 dkp to him. So he won't loot it.

So the item rots.

The guild argument is that letting the warrior have it for less (or 
nothing), to prevent it from rotting would be unfair to all the rangers 
who spent 100 dkp getting the bow. So they'd rather the item rot.

Many guilds and their systems let items rot. People are that stupid.

Some guilds do this... to 'motivate' participation. If tuesday is harder 
to get enough people... suddenly there's bonus dkp on tuesday...is mob x 
unpopular because all the warriors and clerics online won't get any 
potential upgrade drops from it, but the raid can't proceed without 
them...ok bonus dkp on the mob...

Raids also go from guild-wiping-challenge to routine farm overnight. 
Points values may need to change at that stage.

Fair comment with respect to time input. I'll comment on this below.

Point values don't need to be 'set' in the first place, let the market 
do it. An encounter goes from challenge to farm overnight. An item drop 
goes from desireable to obsolete almost as fast. Why bother to try to 
price-fix items by council??

Actually, in my experience it went the other way. They didn't change 
nearly often enough. Items were set a minimum dkps and/or class 
restricted far beyond their usefulness. To the point that 'older' raids 
would become unpopular becuase the item drops were 'too expensive' and 
not as good as drops in other content, or items would rot because they 
weren't enough of an upgrade to justify the price.

Its not 'complex' in that its hard... its complex in that there are 
multiple LC type groups figuring out what the exceptions du jour are, 
what the raid point values are, etc etc. Several places for fairness to 
be tossed out the window.

Good point. I failed express myself well...I was thinking in terms of 
raid-nights, not 'mob encounters'. I was thinking in terms of Raid 
nights that typically run from 5pm to midnight say... regardless of what 
you hit.

If you are in a guild that runs 15 minute 'raids'. Then I would still 
avoid assigning points to the mob, and just go to a simple points/hour, 
and require you participate from beginning to end of any specific 
encounter to get the points.

If the raiders and raid leaders who are present are 'worth a damn' this 
won't happen in the first place... so its a non-issue that doesn't need 
to be corrected by contorted dkp systems.

If a warrior is seriously going to outbid and deprive a ranger of that 
bow then the warrior needs a kick in the head not the point system.

True. What is well designed? I prefer pure market based pricing, and 
time-related dkp points... ideally fixed nightly... or in light of 
variable length raid nights... hourly based.

The system should let warriors buy the uber bow if they want it that 
bad. If they're outbidding a ranger who clearly needs it orders of 
magnitude more then let them, and then eject them from the guild. The 
warrior earned the item sure, and he can have it... but he's obviously 
not a team player... so dump the asshat warrior not the simple point system.
