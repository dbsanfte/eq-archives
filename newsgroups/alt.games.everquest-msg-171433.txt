The problem is that they recommend low levels of protection for the entire
system as a way of allowing their game to run... Thanks, but no thanks.   I
use Norton Internet Protector, also.  I ca either stop protection to run a
recently patched version, or just update the system to accept it.  Let's
see, protected or unprotected (not wonderful protection, but protection
never the less)?
