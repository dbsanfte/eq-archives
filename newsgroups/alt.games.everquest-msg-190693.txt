I was *only* talking about PL'ing.  It's probably impossible or damn near to
get max exp on a kill without help.  It's not too hard to figure out what
the max possible exp you can get is for a PL'er.  If you kill a mob 5 levels
higher and get 5% exp and then kill a mob 10 levels higher and get 5% exp
and then kill a mob 15 levels higher and get 5% exp, then 5% exp is the max
you're gonna get for any single kill.

My personal method in the early 30s was in City of Mist.  I left when stuff
started to turn blue in the late 30s, but that's when most people would
actually start hunting the zone.
