Best group I've gone through LDoN with so far is
65 ranger
65 cleric
65 druid
65 mage
65 warrior
65 beastlord

Adds?  Just off tank them with a pet.  Usually fought
at most 2 (ranger 'bots the cleric and used pacify to
pull).  Also, slow becomes far less important in a
65/normal adventure when you have high dps. 

Also, don't underestimate track - we had 4 mini's up
in the last collection mission we ran - track was 
invaluable for allowing us to go the right way toward
them and kill them during the adventure, instead of
taking an extra 30 minutes to finish them all up.
