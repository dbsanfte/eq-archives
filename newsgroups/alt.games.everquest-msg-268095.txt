Or indeed if, my book was wrecked, and only page 3 was intact, why 
shouldn't I be able to sell it on its own, to a collector for example 
who is assembling the various pages in hopes of one day getting the 
whole book.

Its worth pointing out that Sony actualy only provides a blank account, 
and the means to acquire 'items'. The account doesn't actually come with 
much. 

As an interesting aside, the character is a completely original and 
unique construction, named, coloured, and equipped exclusively through 
the account holders effort. The character is as much MY IP as the truck 
I invent with lego, or the clown face i invent using lite-brite.
