We *did* ask him that....  He showed the world that the so-called
defenceless wern't so defenceless.  He went on to show the world 
that these people are mal-contents, don't care about the land,
have a crack-pot leader that has done absolutly NOTHING for their
plight except lead them down a path that put them in a position
much worse off then they EVER were. They've done absolutly NOTHING
to better themselves, advance their culture, work the land etc.
And all that has NOTHING to do with opression. Two-way street here.

There have been many *other* cultures that have been in positions
much more opressive, but yet managed to advance themselves, their
cause, work the land, and be content. Many cultures!  The Arabs
need to do a little introspection and quit blaming the "haves" 
for their problems.  I've never-ever seen a 3rd world culture
that was SUCH a fucking bunch of whiners, blame shifters, stooopid
mal-contents in ALL my life! Arabs need to wake up, roll up their
sleeves and do some "real" work instead of this constant whining,
"I'm a victim" crying bullshit!  China, India, Viet Nam, Russia,
Cuba, South America, the East block etc ALL have worked their ASSES
off to forward their cause, and make a name for themselves, and some
risked their lives to come over to the "Great America" both, pre and
post WWII and were greatfull as FUCK, took any job, broke their backs,
and faught in our military.  But yet these Arab Palistinian whining
saps don't even know a hard days work. They whine, they bomb, then
kill, then they whine some more, and run like hell from a hard days
work.  They would'nt know a golden oppertunity if it smacked them
in the face.  Yet, in pre/post WWII, imigrants from the EU, Poland,
Italy, Chech, etc never looked back when boarding death-trap boats
to come to the "great America".

 I can go to New York and see the diverse culture and think about
all the Ethnic storys growing up on the East coast and it warms
my heart.  I see these Arab mal-contents and it litterly makes
me want to PUKE. They bring nothing to America but grief, they
are hostile in the states, nasty to people in the 7-11's, they
"smell", and they have no good food at all (what the fuck do Arabs
eat anyhow?)  Contrast all of *that* with say, East Indians...
I can run into *any* East indian, be it at a college, a friend,
a cabbie at the airport etc. etc. and they are "generally" really
really friendly people. Cubans even friendlier yet! etc. etc.

 I know you will all bag me for sterotyping, but I'm sorry, it
*is* a stereotypical world. These are my observations, and I'm
far from living a sheltered life - I *have* been around !
