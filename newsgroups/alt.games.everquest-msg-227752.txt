Yep, it's in the Filters section and I've used it that way, it prevents them
from even seeing your LFP requests. Yeah, /ignore works for this to a point,
it's just not optimal. There are some players that I don't mind speaking to,
I just ... don't want to group with them!

The other issue, as you point out, is just tracking various observations
about all those players. I play this online poker game that allows you to
annotate any player in the game. This is really important when you're
playing poker because there are so many individual quirks about people that
you just need to learn, like tells, style, etc., you really benefit
tremendously by being able to annotate any online player and then when you
see them at the table later, you can pull up your notes on them and get a
refresher. I got spoiled by this system and would love having it in EQ...
