There are probably other ways (and I'd love to hear them!), but the
one I know is to use F10 to go into "Transparent Window" mode and
press the V key. A rather large window should appear and somewhere on
the right are < > type keys allowing you to alter the amount you put
into alternate XP in 10% chunks. Press the V key in this view to get
rid of the window.

Hope it helps,
Dave B.
