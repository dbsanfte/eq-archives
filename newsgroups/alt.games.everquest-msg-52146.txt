A while back I wanted some crafted Pauldrons so I decided to do the quest.
2 Fire Emeralds at 94pp each.  2  hours running around trying to kill a
Griffon to get the eye, turn them in to the centaur and viola I have the
pauldrons.    A bit later I'm at the tunnel and crafted pauldrons are
selling for 200pp left and right.  I saved 12pp and wasted two hours by
doing the quest.  Granted it was somewhat fun going through the process but
in terms of pp and time it seems like a waste of time.
