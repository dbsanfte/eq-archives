    I remember running a dwarf paladin to the docks in bb, and
hailing every NPC to try to figure out how to make the boat
appear, or learn where it might go.   Finally I ran up to a
dwarf warror PC and asked him the same thing.  He laughed, and
told me the boat showed up on it's own, and went to Freeport.
   I thanked him for the info.  Then I asked him how much it
cost to ride the boat.
