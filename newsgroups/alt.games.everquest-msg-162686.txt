It's a trial to show that you are worthy to move on to one of the next tier
of planes, not sure which one off hand.  I don't know any of the details,
but, yes, it involves killing things.  Basically, if you successfully
complete the trial, your character will be flagged to allow you to go to
whatever place that particular trial is for.  It is not a trial like a court
trial, it is a trial, like a test of your mettle.
