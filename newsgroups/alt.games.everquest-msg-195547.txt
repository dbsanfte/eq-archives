No matter what the targets are, EQ is a rinse & repeat process.  Groups have
a set amount of maximum damage output.  Your "game knowledge and experience
combined with good grouping skills" are needed to hit that maximum output.

My wife & I have been playing the game for well over 2 years.  We never do
pick-up groups.  The same bunch of people day-in/day-out, using Battlecom
(voice over I.P.) to communicate.  We rock everything we do & then some.   I
think we maintain close to the maximum damage output most of the time.

C3 just lets us do more.  This does not make the game easier, we just do
more.  In my opinion, more is better.  More XP, more loot, more fun.  Most
times we actually keep a chanter logged nearby to refresh it.  Buddy of mine
that don't play much anymore.  =)
