Thought so, but as soon as I just said 'he' you'd be a she and bite my 
head off so I hedged my bets.

Okies, I didn't understand that part. I screwed up by not reading the 
entire thread it was just not something I was going to slog through... I 
should've.

Ooooooh... he's gonna catch you on not saying 'universaler' he don't

NOW the light comes on and I completely understand you and agree with 
you... (not about repercussions, but about what they should have done to 
start out with.)

no no no Sorry about implying it was your word. I didn't come here until 
too late. I was responding to your post so I referred to it here as 
coming from you. I didn't pay attention to you using someone elses(1) 
word too. See... footnotes would be SO helpful. :) My 9th grade English 
teacher was right. :)

I totally agree.


(1) I can never remember if that warrants an apostrophe or not. If it 
does consider it in there, but gobbled up by the bit-monkeys in 
transmission. If it's not supposed to be there then good. I left it out 
on purpose.
