Huh?  You have access to an epic cleric, yet you can't camp a 49+ cleric 
out?  Or a necro with essence emerald?  Or a 60 Pally?  Come on, maybe a 
mage for CoH will take a rezgoo rez from the dragging monk, but an active 
cleric?  Of course if it's a naggy/vox raid, any epic cleric I've ever 
seen will have to be camped out anyway.

Damage shield?  The ONLY damage shield a bard has (Psalms don't stack with 
other resist songs) is the level 57 McVaxius's Rousing Rondo, which is 
about 18 pts with epic or a good brass instrument.  However a bard SHOULD 
be singing resist songs (I usually twist the fr/cr OR pr/dr AND the mr) 
and occlusion of sound.  If you only need the specific fr/cr/pr/dr and not 
the mr, AND you're level 55, you might want to swap in Catata for mana 
regen.

I really can't think of any raid where bard melee buffs are that critical.  
Yeah, the Vah Shir haste-cap breaking songs are nice, but I would still 
stick with resists, then mana, then haste boost, then ATK buff in that 
order once OOS (unresistable 26 pt debuff) is covered.

Don't necros get a group heal lifetap thing in Luclin?  This might be a 
really nifty place for them, if their tap isn't resisted.

One tactic we've been trying, which is very helpful on 100k+ mobs is to 
build a main tank group as follows

60 Warrior MA
60 Warrior SA
Cleric 
Cleric
Cleric
Bard

The bard in this case twists resists and manasong, let some other bard who 
ISN'T standing right under the mob take care of OOS.  The three clerics 
get a CHeal chain going, and if the MA dies, the clerics IMMEDIATELY 
switch their CHeal chain to the SA.  It's up to the healers for the other 
melees to worry about whomever is unlucky enough to draw aggro before SA 
establishes solid aggro.
