Since the concept of talent is entirely a matter of personal opinion,
so any argument based on "so-and-so isn't talented" is flawed from the
start.

Even if you assume the boy bands and such are completely talentless,
you can't ignore the other aspects involved - it's still work (theirs,
not yours) and no one is entitled to it for free.

And I agree with you - I think it's crap, too. Of course, record sales
might indicate that this isn't the only valid take on the matter.

I have to ask - if someone feels that way about this music, why do
they *want* to steal it? I'll let you work out the permutations of
that question.

I don't have sympathy for much of anyone (as anyone familiar with my
posting history here certainly can attest), but that doesn't mean I'm
permitted to steal from them.

>I guess it comes down to how much you respect the person(s) who put in

I respect them enough to know that you can't justify theft simply
because you don't believe they're talented.
