Butcherblock now has a decent place to hunt for 30th lvl chanter to about
35th. There are
3 goblins that spawn just past Kaladim as you are heading to crossroads.
they spawn behind
the guard shack on the left side of the path. Decent exp and good loot. And
if they get out of
hand, it's just a jog over to the guards.
