Brother don't help the "We hate the Druids "cause with the title.We are the
hated majority.Its the 8-12 year old faction of our rank that give us this
curse.You are just helping them,We need to work together to stop this.But
I'm not bashing you.The whole charging for ports is out.Think about it like
gaining faction.faction with the druid haters club.But we cant look like we
are desperate.We are not !We can solo and out side of shamans we are great
buffers ,...and if the case maybe power levelers,...no we are the "go to"
guys as far as power levelers!Any way we have to reconstruct our image.
