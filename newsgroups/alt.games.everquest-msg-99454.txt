Happened to us when we were doing it with a guild druid.  Gave
ample warning ahead of time, then some moron attacked the giant
on his way to the fort.  Since a PC has to turn in stuff they
have aquired in order to do this quest, I think attacking the
resultant spawn *should* be against the PNP.  I don't think
it is, but that's a failure on the part of the PNP.
