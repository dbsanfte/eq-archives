One could argue that, but one would be wrong <jk>.  Seriously, now that you
have agreed that there IS a limit to what is reasonable, consider that that
limit is entirely subjective and that to tell someone that they shouldn't go

believes that the donation is less than reasonable then it IS.  He is the
one that gets to judge it.
