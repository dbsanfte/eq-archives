It depends on your play style and amount of time you have to play.

I haven't even hit 60 on any of my characters (after a year, but I spent 
a bunch of that time developing FlexBar), and there is an expansion
about a year off that will likely boost character levels.  Also, we have
yet to see hero classes introduced, and they continue to introduce
new content in each patch.

For someone starting now it could have some pretty good longevity.
