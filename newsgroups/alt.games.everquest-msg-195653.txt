I don't remember the gap from banded to rubicite being awful.  The
plate classes moved to bronze (if you could wear small bronze it was
pretty cheap, that's why wood elf bards were considered a better 
idea than HE or Hum) which was only a little better than banded.

I know of a bard who actually put together the cash for a small 
storebought plate BP - but I don't think lots of plate classes actually
ever touched the stuff prior to camping rubicite.

I never got any rubicite for my bard - regular bronze started dropping
decently in Permafrost, so I wore a mix of Banded/Bronze when I 
stopped my bard (changed ISP's and my ping climbed 150 to 325+.  I
found twisting much more difficult).

Was there something in between bronze and rubi that I'm not remembering?
