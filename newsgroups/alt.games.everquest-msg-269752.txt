I have only seen reviews where EQ1/EQ2 loses against WoW.
Has there been any review at all where EQ1/EQ2 beats WoW?

Yes, i know WoW set a new world record on first day sales, and that it is
probably better than EQ line of games, but its kind of hard to believe SOE
didn't produce something better than EQ2 given the time and experience they had
from EQ1.
