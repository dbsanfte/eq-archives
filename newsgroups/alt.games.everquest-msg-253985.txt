Hi
Heard about this zone today, anyone know if I need LoY/GoD as I don't have
either.
I seem to be having a problem getting in to it at the moment as it says
something about not being able to enter dynamic zones, I am downloading all
the optional zones as suggested to me by someone but I was wondering if I
needed any of the special expansions as it would be good to find out now
rather than later.
Thanks
Ceri :o)
