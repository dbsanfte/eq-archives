Why was it they "couldn't possibly win"? Because the majority was not 
going to vote for them. There was a reason for that, and it wasn't 
because the voters are for the most part mindless cattle, following one 
candidate for no specific reason. If one is to believe that, then it 
would stand to reason that one would also have to deem us incapable of 
governing ourselves to begin with. 

Apparently the majority disagree with your view on who should be 
president for the next four years. Otherwise, you wouldn't feel the
need to resort to playing games with your contribution to the election.
I would ask, sincerely with all due respect, who are you to decide that
the majority opinion should not be observed? Sure, the 2000 presidential
election would be a rare example of an instance where this *might* not
have held true. I say *might* because the difference in the number of
votes won by each of the top two candidates that year was small enough
that it could have gone either way had all votes been counted accurately
and true popular opinion been represented (everyone voting for their
actual candidate of choice). The system isn't perfect, but there is a
valid reason for every aspect of it. 

Additionally, what if enough Libertarian party voters took your approach
when they could have actually made a significant difference for their
candidate had they actually voted true? Nevermind whether you think it
would ever happen or not, because you can't prove that it wouldn't,
though there is no disputing that it *could*. 

I'm not a huge fan of the whole partisan-based system. Regardless, I feel 
strongly that we should all vote our conscience and let the candidate 
with the most votes win. There is no justification for false pretenses 
where your vote is concerned.
