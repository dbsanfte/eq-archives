We use a DKP system and at first a lot of people didnt like it but
neither did they like to old list/random method. Now that we've using
it more than a year its very popular. And there have a been a lot of
kinks we've had to work out. The system is fairly complex, thank god
we have a very good database person keeping track of everything. Btw,
its a lot more work, raidleaders or some other officer has to keep
track of everyone who is at the raid and for how long (not that bad,
with a macro) and then make sure the figures are entered into the
database the next day. Also we use a system where at a certain level
when you reach so many dkp's you start earning them at a slower pace,
helps keep inflation in check. And what i like is it give "you"
control over your loot. Want that super uber item? Save up till you
can outbid anyone. Rather have a lot of little upgrades? Bid on those
minor items most people dont think are worth much. I'm an in
betweener, more than casual raider but not nearly as hardcore as some
of our people and I think the system works well. Far from perfect and
I don't doubt we'll continue to tinker with it but its far better than
any other system I've seen.
