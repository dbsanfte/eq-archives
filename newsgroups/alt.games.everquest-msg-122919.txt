Dunno about others, but I got a lot of satisfaction from working up
smithing to 177 on my main (with a wis that never exceeded 94, I might
add).  Then they introduced the first cultural armors and Half-elves
were shafted.  Their backstory excuse (cultural secret, not shared
with others) is actually pretty pathetic when you consider that this
"secret" is shared between Clerics of Rodcet Nife and Shadowknights
of Bertoxxulus (sp?), between Paladins of Mithaniel Marr and
Necromancers of Innoruk (sp?), etc.  It soured me so thoroughly on
tradeskills that I couldn't bring myself to finish skilling up to 175
with my human Cleric twink on Tunare or to get as far as I could with
my human Druid on FV before the skill-up nerf that was so talked about
here.

Hmm, turned into a bitch about "ancient" history, oh well, gonna post
it anyway.  :p
