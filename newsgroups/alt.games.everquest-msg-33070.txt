I'm thinking about starting up a warrior character.

I've only played a cleric so far.  Toyed a little with the other classes at
the beginning but not much.  Found I enjoyed being a cleric when it was a
nice well-rounded class at lower levels.  Easy to solo with.  Got burnt out
in my mid-20's (can you say "mana sponge"?) and took several weeks off from
EQ.  Became back and simply hunted for WIS gear.  Got back into the swing of
things.  Currently, my cleric is 34th and has once again taken a break from
leveling and gone WIS gear hunting ... though I am thinking of possibly just
working my behind off to get to 39th and then just buying better gear with
the money I'll make off my first XP rez.  Anyway...

I've had lots of discussions with high-level cleric players ... when they're
playing their alts.  A common bit of advice is to start up and play a
warrior as my main alt.  Their logic is that it helps me become a better
cleric by being on the other side of the fence ... the other end of a heal
spell.  It is also a nice break away from being a cleric since the warriors
are almost the opposite of clerics.  They are in the thick of battle and
they can't cast a single spell.

So right now, I'm thinking of starting up a warrior.  Definitely a
back-burner character ... until I get my cleric a clicker (whereupon I'll
then devote my attention to another character ... possibly the warrior).
But I thought I'd start one up now and take my time with it.  First, I'm
wondering what race to make the warrior.

OGRES have the best starting stats for a warrior, nightvision, get Bash at
first level, and really look the part of a tank.  Their down side is mainly
travel.  They're an evil race thus it's hard to get around.

TROLLS have not as good starting stats for a warrior and are just as
unwelcomed in most cities.  They do get regen but with a cleric in the
group, that's seems pretty much worthless.

BARBARIANS rank third in starting stats and do not have nightvision, but are
welcomed in most cities.

I've been told that once I get my cleric to 39th level, I'll be rolling in
the dough by doing XP rezzes so I can just buy my ogre warrior whatever he
needs and tweak him up nicely so cities won't really matter anymore.
Leveling the ogre in its newbie areas then hitting Oasis, Lake of Ill Omen,
Frontier Mountains, and Overthere THEN I head over to Velious, where
traveling isn't a problem for ogres there.  However, am I robbing myself of
too much land (sightseeing) by playing an ogre?

Speaking of stats, since my cleric will be able to tweak my warrior out,
does it really matter which race I make into a warrior?  When you add all
stats up for each race, don't they all equal the same or where the
difference is relatively insignificant anyway?  If this is true, then the
stat consideration should be tossed out since I can then make up for a
race's stats with the appropriate gear.  True?  If true, how then would ALL
the races compare against each other for being the best warrior?

Comments?  Suggestions?
