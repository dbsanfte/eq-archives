I think that the -last- one in the series was the Wizard and Glass, and I
can't truthfully say that it was the best. I bought it in trade paperback
when it first came out (which was awhile ago) and I STILL haven't finished
it. I don't normally have a problem with "suspension of disbelief", but I
did, with this book. Not sure why, but it seemed a bit ridiculous.
