Oh, I get it.  To me, my correction was also a joke. :) I've long found 
the evolution of the term 'cyber' amusing.  But perhaps it's only me. :)

In high school, I was really curious about AI and robotics.  At some 
point, I heard that the term 'cybernetics' had originated as the title 
of a book by a fellow named Norbert Wiener (poor guy).  So naturally, I 
went out of my way to get my hands on a copy of that book... I was 
rather alarmed by how little it had to do with what -I- thought AI or 
robotics would be about (admittedly, I probably got most of my 
preconceived notions from Star Wars.) :)

And now the term seems to have attached itself to chatroom sex.  It's a 
funny old world.

I've only been in a couple cyber cafes... One I can think of in San 
Francisco, and the other in Tours, France (where apparently it's 
pronounced seebearkahfeh, which somehow also greatly amused me. :) )
Neither of them featured much fragging...  Just people websurfing and 
checking their email.  Might be fun to try one that actually did do 
gaming.
