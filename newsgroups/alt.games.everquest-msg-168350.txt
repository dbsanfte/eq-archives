omg. lance are you just trying to be rude? or prove some points to me that I
didn't know?

This was just an experience that I had.. When I lost my corpse.. I wasn't
too worried about it.. i was gonna leave it there until I could fine a
cleric to rezz.. never did.. so i just left it.

and the monk could have at least got the mob off me..taunt?? some form of
taunt monks have??../shrug..

it was just an exp.. to let the person know how it is for some people
succoring across SG
