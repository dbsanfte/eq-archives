Well dammit, it does if you'd just go along with my unspecified
assumptions.  Sheesh!  What kind of a mind reader are you anyway?

Yes, the lots and lots part.  When you have 4 or 5 melees, not one
of whom has over 2khp (well maybe the Warrior would if you symbol
him, but you probably don't cause it costs a lot of mana and besides
he's too damned cheap to supply his own gems), CHeal is inferior to
SHeal.  I'm sorry I described my example so fucking incompletely.

OK?

Instead, imagine a 40 Warrior, a 42 Monk, a 40 Paladin, a 43 Ranger, and
a 40 Cleric fighting in DL with no twink gear on any of the melees.  Go
one step further and imagine that not only have these 5 never grouped
as a whole before, but not one of them has grouped with more than 2 of
the others before, and that one is unguilded and the other four come
from 3 different guilds.  In short, imagine a pickup group in DL that
has the great good fortune to not have a single twink in it.  Sadly,
they are not gonna be working any complex tactic like you describe
below.

Kaev <--- promises not to post again to this thread, regardless of
provocation or lack thereof  :-p
