I've seen this behavior on one of my two machines.  I traced it to one
the ATI control panel/doohickey.  When it is running (and it runs by
default into the system tray) I get the behavior you describe.  If I
kill the process (must kill through task manager), then run EQ, no
problems.

So, I'd say it is a problem with ATI, not Sony.
