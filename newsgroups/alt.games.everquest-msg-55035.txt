To the best of my knowledge there is no demo version of EQ available. 
You might try seeing what it would cost to order direct from Verant.  I
would recommend ordering the trilogy, if it's not cost prohibitive.  You
might also try the website for the magazine.  Many of the game magazines
have the same files as are on the cd's available for download.
