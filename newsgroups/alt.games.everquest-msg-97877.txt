Having to find and push a button might be a bit traumatic. A better
solution is just to institute a "bind2" point with a command like
/bind2. That way you can make a hotkey for it. If it looks like you're
going to die, you hit that and it assigns a temporary second bind point
right where you are fighting. Then after you pop up with all your gear
and no xp loss at your primary bind point, you simply port to your bind2
spot and continue.

The one we really need is the equivalent of the Lara Croft "all weapons"
cheat. The command that just shows you a vendor with every weapon in the
game for sale for one copper. It would save so much tedious traumatic
time hunting all those mobs that drop them, not to mention the money
you'd spend if you had to /auction for them.
