/grin
"Just because you can" does not equate to "intelligent", at least not
as I and (I think) Dennis used it.  OTOH, Kaev's first rule of gaming
states:  fun > "intelligent" choices
And if you manage to build a Ranger who can tank for a duo in HoH I
will be happy to applaud the achievement.

That may be true at higher levels, in fact I'm happy to accept
you Dennis as authorities on the subject.  But my Ranger is a
dedicated lowbie (a magnificent L21 more than 44 months after
creation) who notes the fact that red-con mobs are dinking him
for 1 or 2 a whole helluva lot more often than they get in a
nice big smack for 50 or so.  I'll have fights that last long
enough for Flame Lick to wear off twice (obviously I miss and
nick a lot too) and take 200 to 400 hp damage (depending on
just how many times the mob gets lucky).  I'm actually able to
kill red cons quite a bit faster than my Druids were able to
at this level, without any outside buffs and owning no regen
item, so at low level Ranger mitigation appears to be just fine.

I think it's time to go find a mostly empty Luclin zone so he
can live up to the little ditty that inspired his creation:

Starkle, Starkle little twink,
You're not so great, that's what I think,
Up above the world so high,
Think you own the whole damned sky,
Starkle, Starkle little twink,
You're not so great that's what I think!  :-p
