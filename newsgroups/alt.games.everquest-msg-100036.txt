"/tracksort distance" to sort by distance, "/tracksort rdistance" to sort
by reverse distance.  "/tracksort normal" to go back to normal order (which is
by spawn time, with newer mobs on top) or "/tracksort rnormal" to go in
reverse normal order.  "/tracksort con" or "/tracksort rcon" to go by color.

Also useful is "/trackfilter green" to remove greens from the list.  You can
do this for other colors to remove them, too, but that can be risky.  I
believe this is a toggle, so you can do it again to turn those back on.

"/trackplayers on" and "/trackplayers off" will turn on and off showing
other players in tracking.

For the other classes that get tracking (Druid and Bard), the order is always
by spawn time, with newest on top, so they don't get /tracksort.  They also
don't get /trackfilter.  They do get /trackplayers.
