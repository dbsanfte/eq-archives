A friend sent me the Kunark patch a few days ago. I had already registered
it online, since I had bought the Kunark expansion (it got smashed in my
truck rollover). It took me a lot of hours to download the 'patch', but I
finally got it finished. He said that the best way to 'test' it out would be
to jump onto the shuttles from the BB zone. He said that my lvl 18 druid
would stand a better chance of not dying at the other end. Is there anything
else I need to know about that zone? I really don't want to die to some
ogres or orcs, standing on the docks. Mostly I want to be able to explore
Kunark (I don't expect to do so, in a safe fashion, as NOTHING in Norrath is
'safe'). Can I do this with a level 18 Halfling druid, without dying
constantly? Darklet needs some new hunting grounds, and I thought that this
might meet the need.

Any suggestions, comments, advice, etc?

TIA
Darklet druid of 18 seasons
