So I got the 7-day freebie from Verant.  AFter much tribulation, I manage
to log into EQ using my old old laptop (graphics card has no 3-d
acceleration and 4MB memory) so I can chat to old friends and stagger
around Qeynos.  This is what I don't get...my magelo is exactly the right
gear.  Yet...

in EQ I have  2370hp without stat food
on magelo I have 2290hp with halas meat pie

in-game ac is 994 vs the 974 of magelo, but I figure maybe I forgot to
update my naked AC/ATK

I have no buffs other than sow.

What the heck is going on?  Maybe they gave us 7-day-freebiers an extra
100+ hp.  Not that I'm complaining, mind you, I just want my magelo to
look that extra bit of "I'm not so wimpy".
