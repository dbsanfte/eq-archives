yes, I do understand that Porting is not the only way to travel... but
Porting is a feature that does make some places more accessable.
on your point... what about evil classes? not as accessable.  sure
they could hop the ship, but then they still should get a bind...
doh... run all the way to the outpost, ?

What you call accessable could be considerd the same for passage
through the warrens..

Hmm..  Port to tox, zone to Paineel, zone to warrens, sone to SB?...
right?

Hmm... freeport, wait on boat, zone to oot, zone to FV zone to LoIO?
right?

both have about the same zones.....  so to me point is moot...

good hunting where ever you please .....
 oh and LoIO just looses out because of the atypical manners in the
zone...
