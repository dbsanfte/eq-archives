I did do a lot of the Trade Commissioner Henry quest. Rebecca is on the
general faction with Shadowhaven folks. If they like you well enough to buy
and sell from her and from the other folks, your faction should be ok. You
are definitely not KOS with her without faction work, so you can go up to
her and see if she talks. If not, go do the TCH quest about four times, and
she should be happy to trade earrings with you.
