Druids CAN in the right situations as in not uber rooms make quite a good
primary healer.At higher levels even with greater heal I have as a druid done
karnors on moat groups and rarely lost anyone.The bit about judicious use of
roots is very important.Druids main talent in healing at higher levels lies in
the group regen spells.In most cases these will save them TONS of mana.Clerics
are better true but usually in shorter supply.
