I personally don't want to get killed and lose something I worked hard 
to get.

I have a hard enough time with adds from NPCs and having to deal with 
PCs attacking me while I'm trying to get xp from some random orc is just 
too much for me.

My son begged me to allow him to start a character on a PVP server.  I 
finally relented.  The poor kid didn't stand a chance.  He kept being 
PK'd.  He had someone camping his corpse so his stuff rotted.  The final 
straw was when he got so upset he started crying.  He's a sensitive kid, 
I'll give you that, it comes from being an only child who almost died at 
birth, we kind of 'wussified' him a little.  But usually he can hold it 
together, he understands EQ is a game.  I waited till he went to bed 
that night then took all his stuff and gave it to a newbie, including 
the money, and then deleted the character.  The next day, I told him he 
could start over on any other server but a PVP one.
