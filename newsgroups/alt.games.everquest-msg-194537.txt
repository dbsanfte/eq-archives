One of the few things slowing down a soloing bard is his
abyssimal mana regen rate.  I've looked at Mental Clarity (lot of
AA points to get to that, probably worth it if it works) and FT
(got my solstice earring although I'm still not sure it actually
works, enough people said it did that I went ahead and got one,
heck, only cost about 4Kpp and its a nice earring FT or no)

But another mana regenerater is available, my butt.  I've learned
to sit down whenever on break, and it does a lot for my pathetic
mana regen.  Thing is, I don't sit much, who takes breaks?

Something my cleric discovered back when POP heal aggro was
really insane; a horse means sitting all the time you don't have
the attack button down.

This would mean that a horse for a bard would be a massive boost
in mana regen, since I'm on my feet but not meleeing about 90% of
my soloing life.

Thing is, they killed the invisible horse trick, so we have to
suffer the irritating horse head, the clunky movement... would
this be such a problem for a bard as to make the mana really not
worthwhile?  I mean, a bit more mana would be nice, but not at
the expense of good cornering ability or the ability to reverse
directions to pick up the next target with F8 and spin back to
keep moving away without getting caught by the swarm and eaten
alive.

At 9K plus, I really don't feel like experimenting with this,
particularly as I suspect the only really usable horses would be
the higher end ones.  Anyone out there already experiment with
this idea?
