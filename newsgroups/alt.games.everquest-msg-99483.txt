I'm a newbie so I have stuff to sell at about 60-80 pp. I get no response so
I substitute the price with make offer. I don't expect 60-80 pp I expect
less. Hey... it's your loss if you bitch about it, I simply won't sell you
the item at a higher price or at a cheaper price... rather give it to some
newbie (woops me lol).
