You can't killsteal in WoW, but you can killspoil.  If player A starts a 
fight and has done a small amount of damage, and then a high level 
player B comes along and kills the mob, it reduces or eliminates (I 
forget which) XP for A.  I don't know if this XP reduction is based on 
amount of damage, or levels of the players, or what.  We didn't do a lot 
of experimenting, just a couple of test cases to see if it would help or 
hurt low level players to blast their mobs when running by, and we found 
that it would hurt them.
