It was one of the three reasons I chose my dwarf.

Small race
Extremely cool jumping animation
Reasonable sense heading so you can find out where you're going.

I never liked loc much.   Getting a set of exact coordinates with no real
meaning always took me out of the game a lot more than thinking "ok, I'm
heading north.   Where I want to go is off to the northeast"   I use it when
appropriate, but never really liked it.
