My reader didnt' pick up the original message, sadly.

Yes, Fear can be tough when you're just starting out and don't have the
levels for it. However, later on you'll find that it's a fun zone.
Breakin and CR there are no tougher than most other zones of similar
level, and in fact far easier than Hate, by way of example.

We've been raiding the hell out of Fear the last month or so for epic
drops. We generally break it and clear to the first safe spot with one
group, sending in another a couple minutes later. Once you get the
timing down, have good crowd control (this is mandatory in fear) and
respectable DPS, it's not bad. And some of the loot is very nice, even
the random drops. I'm wearing a carmine turban right now, in fact.
