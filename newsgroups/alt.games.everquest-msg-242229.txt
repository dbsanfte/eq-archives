i love FV!  i played on a couple other servers, but i just couldn't get into
the game as much on those as i could on FV.  i notice that a lot of people
roleplay, and those who don't accept the fact that they are, in fact, on the
RP server and that people are, in fact, going to RP.  i would suggest just
being flexable about it.  i have friends who like to roleplay and those who
don't (and one who can't seem to decide), i just group with whoever i feel
like playing with that day.

i usually notice that people will, or at least attempt to, role play with
you if you start role playing with them.  there are a few who are totally
against the whole role playing thing and refuse to do it, but then what are
they doing on FV???  no one knows...

so what i'm trying to say is that, in my months (thats right, hasn't even
been a year yet) of experience, i have noticed that there are a lot more
role playing ppl on the FV server than on other servers.  the only problem
is that there is no way to tell the role players from the non-role players
because no one uses the RP button that makes your name turn purple.  of
course, i'm kinda a hippocrit because i role play and my name is
blue...purple is just a color that i want to stay away from, ok!?!

and about the whole language thing, i did not start out knowing human, only
dark elvish and elder elvish.  and the latter was only at 25...you all
probably know by now that i'm new, so i don't know what the FV server was
like before, but they might have changed it so that there was no common
toungue or something, i don't know.  but i do think that having the
different languages adds to the role playing experience.
