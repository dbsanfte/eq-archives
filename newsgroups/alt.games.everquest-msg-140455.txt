Interpolation is a biggie, but you get increased ghosting, increased
"jitter" and loss of contrast...also, you may get dead areas of the screen,
either the letter-box effect or a band of black just to get it to fit in the
LCD "window". This happens due to the DA conversion process, not just due to
the effects of the screen proper.

One important advance in LCD screen is the eventual total abandonment of
analog circuitry, a  true digital path from geometry to eyeball minimizes
these problems, but they aren't quite gone yet.
