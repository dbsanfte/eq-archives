Yes,my rant about dumbing down was more about EQ2.
At least EQ1 has the advantage of being old and therefor has a lot of
more content.I can see that level 80 + a sufficient number of AAs in
EQ1 look like an invincible mountain for a new player.
But in EQ2 the above is not true which leads to a silly combination - 
easy maximizing levels and AAs in a few weeks and much less content
than EQ1.
Note that I left EQ1 a year ago after about 7 years playing with some
breaks,EQ2 could hold my interest about 6 months,that with a rl friend
who pays for my account and several times talked me in to come
back to EQ2 in this short period,had a burn out every 4 weeks or so
in the 6 months since I started it.
