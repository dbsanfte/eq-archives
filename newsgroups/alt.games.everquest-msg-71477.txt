It's a Dark Elf thing, they all seem to be underconned.

I've been easily soloing Cyndreela (level 40 Erudite necro
in Feerrott) for several levels, but X'ti Tompi and her
sisters (level 40 Dark Elf necro in Neriak) are still
a real handful.

The DE's hit harder, and are more magic resistant, than
their non-DE counterparts.
