Well... colour is the big one. There is no overlap of available colours 
between gender, and females have the subdued coloration. In RL amphibian 
gender isn't generally a trivial exercise either so its not unrealistic. 
  And ultimately, what do you care about gender... (Unless you are 
looking for a prince? :p)

Really good starting swimming/ holding breath underwater abilities, and 
nightvision. But that's about it... then again it beats half-elves. :)

Kicking the trolls out wasn't all bad. Innothule swamp is a horrid 
newbie area, even worse now than before. :) Let the frogs have it.

To each their own. I quite like the look of the frogs.
