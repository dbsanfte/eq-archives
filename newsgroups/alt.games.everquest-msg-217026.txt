I was told five days. I have a medium House full of crap. It just
isn't that exciting, and the PvP turns out pointless as all get out! I
was hopeful there would be things like the Hollowshade war, where you
can influence things as they happened.

For a while Dathomir was spooky and mysterious, until I spent a day
there. It was basically, go out, kite kite kite, and die. Respawn,
heal heal heal, and repeat. Even the imperial retreat was kinda dull.

It is very cool that you can get experience by not fighting, and
tradeskills have an equal footing with combat, but, if digging up ore
is a thrill-a-minute the cure for that is two weeks in West VA (coal
mining country).

The Iksar Necro is not to hard to play, despised everywhere (I love
being hated in softskin towns!), and a good soloer. I can group when I
feel like it, and be pretty self sufficient when I feel like hunting
in Warsilk, South Ro, Lake Rathe or the other low use camps/zones.
Gear isn't dominant, if I have good gear, it is nice, but I can be
effective in my underwear if I don't feel like a CR ATM.

I like to play her antisocial, except for other Iksar, she pretty much
speaks Lizardman all the time, and will sontimes utter a "thank you
softskin' in common. She asked for nothing from others, and is happy
to instill the fear of Cazic Thule on them if they get uppity. She
likes High Elves, in a gumbo, with mudcrabs and veggies. Humans are a
good second choice.

I am constantly amused by those who are confused by a RPing
Iksar......
