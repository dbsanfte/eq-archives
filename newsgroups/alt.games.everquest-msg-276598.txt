Undead - proxmity aggro > all

Some mobs give proximity more associated hate than others.

Hate is made of two components,

1. Hate from actions which builds up
2. Hate from bonuses which come and go

Proximity is a hate bonus (i.e. when you step close it adds +whatever and
when you step away it stops adding that value to your hate amount).

At low levels, if the hate bonus is big enough, it'll overcome any hate
you've generated from damage, spells, etc.

I can recommend the Steel Warrior website
(http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/index.php?s=) for everything you ever
wanted to know about aggro and hate.
