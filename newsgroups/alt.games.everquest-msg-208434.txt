There was clarity (although the number of enchanters so high level they could cast
it wasn't all that high) but no Breeze, Breeze is a Kunark only spell, but unlike
similar spells in later supplements it could be bought from a vendor in FV (or
perhaps OT?) and then sold... so people who bought ROK and got it running during
the couple weeks after release ended up making their guild's happy by importing the
spell, or making a small fortune by selling it to every chanter in Oasis/NRo/WC

There was similar but much more muted excitement about some of the other vendor
buyable ROK spells... but a mana regen spell castable at level 16, that was HOT.
