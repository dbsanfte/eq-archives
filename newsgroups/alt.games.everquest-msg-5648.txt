>  What is this FANG thing?

A newsgroup that began as a forum for those who played a video game
*loosely* based on air combat.

I tried the game long ago ..taxiing onto the grass caused planes to blow up
..there was no energy loss doing consecutive high G moves, the planes looked
like boxy caricatures of what they were supposed to represent ..

..a video game, for video gamers.

It probably drew a lot of kids who have a hard time with Quake as it is a
bit less demanding, or who had a hard time with more realistic simulators
..the only thing missing in Fighter Ace are cheat codes ..LOL..
..it is a simple game.
