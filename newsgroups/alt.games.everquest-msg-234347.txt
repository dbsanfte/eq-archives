Ah, you want me to divuldge trade secrets?  Ok.  Since pets are no longer
aggro to mobs, you can simply have your pet attack a mob and then use pet
hold to make him run back to you with a single mob in tow.  There are a few
subtleties.  Sometimes you'll get on the hate list and thus aggroing all the
mobs you were tying to avoid, which is why this will work better for
necromancers and shadow knights who can fd have pet attack and then wait for
the pet to get back to them before getting up running back to the group.
There is also some sort of level issue.  My guild uses this technique to
seperate some static mobs from a named.  If I use a PoP pet, which are all
level 60, the named and the statics aggro.  If I use the level 49 pet, then
they will come single.  This same technique makes VZ one groupable.
