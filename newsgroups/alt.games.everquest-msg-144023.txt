That brings up what I think is the biggest mistake Verant has ever made with
EQ.  Verant should have said at some point, "All you people beating zone
X...congratulations, you won!  Hope you come back for EQ2 or SWG!" and
stopped trying to add more and more high end content to challenge those
people.

Expansions should have concentrated on story and quests, and maybe new races
and classes, not on adding significantly more power at the high end.
