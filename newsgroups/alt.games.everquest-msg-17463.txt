The Devil is in the details.  I was going to go out and
dominate the world once, but I misplaced my car keys.  By
the time I found them again, Gilligan's Island was playing
on TVLand so I *had* to watch, and then some friends dropped
by and we had pizza, drank beer and played Dungeons and Dragons.
Then it was way late and I fell asleep.  The next morning
I had a hangover and this world domination stuff made my head 
hurt, so I bought a lottery ticket instead.

Maybe next weekend.
