Incorrect.  The guys the OP grouped with are not "just fucking stupid".
They are pathetic self-abusing chumps who happen incidentally to also
be "fucking stupid".

To the OP:  I hope you thoroughly publicize this incident.  Sadly, the
stupidity of the cleric/shaman will probably have more negative impact
on their reputations than their inexcusable behavior at the end.  But
that pair of shit-for-brains assholes has earned an unending supply of
in-game grief and you ought to help serve them their just desserts.
