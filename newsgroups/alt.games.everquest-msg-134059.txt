Wow, lots of points so I just snipped it all. :)

You play on different servers? Why?  I mean, I can understand having a Zek,
an FV, and one regular server...is that what you mean, or do you have
characters spread out among many regular servers?  Unless you play with
friends (and apparently you don't) what's the point?

If you can only play an hour or two at a time, you can still get groups...I
have rarely seen anyone mad if they are told someone has to go in an hour or
so.

Raids:  yeah, minimum raid time for a while would be a few hours.  If you
help a big guild out on an epic fight it might be as little as an hour, but
you very likely won't get anything but a warm feeling from it.  Vox/Naggy
seem to always take 3-4 hours on my server.

Druids:  My 52 druid is asked for a SoW a couple times an hour, and a port
once an hour.  If you have no problem saying "no, sorry, I can't," or simply
ignoring the requests, then the buff beggars are no problem.  Druids are
INVALUABLE for most experience groups, even up to level 60.

Do they have a stigma attached to the class?  Yes, though I think lots less
than they used to.  I don't know which class is the most popular as a Main
(the character you feel is your main one), but if it's druid it's not by
much!  EVERYONE I know is creating freaking monks.  In fact, when they apply
to my guild I call them YAMs (yet another monk).  And enchanters are no
longer rare.

Necros:  Necros get a Summon Corpse spell at a low level.  I imagine they
get begs from people in places like Befallen and Solusek's Eye (SolA) often,
and those are much harder to turn down than a port request, because they may
be in dire straits, and ports are just conveniences.  I could be wrong
though...my necro is at around level 9 & holding...I can't seem to decide
what race to play. <g>  Poor guy started as an Erudite, switched to DE,
switched to Iksar, switched to Gnome and is now DE again.
