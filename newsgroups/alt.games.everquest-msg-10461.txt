Welcome to the world of cultural armor. Its going to always be far
more expensive or difficult to make yourself than just getting
something already existing like darkforge. 

You said you were talking about the chain. The Tierdal
enchanted/imbued cultural plate is pretty okay though. The BP is AC
26, +4 Str, +10 Dex, +4 Wis, +4 Int, Wt. 5.2, Some of the pieces are
better than others. So at least the bp is superior to darkforge. One
thing to note in the thread is how light this stuff is, makes it nice
for dark elves whether cleric or sk.  

www.eqtraders.com

http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=2297.topic

has the recipe and stats.You no longer need the expensive gem
component, just the regular brewed stuff and the enchanted block of
adamantite or something then an imbued sapphire.

A post down on the 2nd page says:

"Edit: total stats for a full suit of known items so far is 142 AC, 42
dex, 35 wis, 48 int, 26 agi, 34 str, at 30.2 weight. Very not bad for
wimpy dark-elf clerics, sk's and warriors"
(talura)

Thats pretty kick butt for an sk or cleric dark elf, jeez 48 int for
an sk with a suit. 

Another post compares it to darkforge:

"Except for the saves, this stuff wipes the floor with darkforge:
Total AC: 91 Weight: 46 STR +4 STA +22 DEX +8 INT +5 Magic Resist +16
Cold Resist +5 Fire Resist +5 Disease Resist +5 Poison Resist +5"

"and umbral:
Total AC: 130 Weight: 37.2 STR +28 STA +14 AGI +5 DEX +24 INT +20 WIS
+5 Magic Resist +10 Cold Resist +10 Fire Resist +10 Disease Resist +13
Poison Resist +13" 
(zolaron)

So if you notice it kicks darkforges bottom, only thing darkforge
really has is 16 percent cold res which tops it.. the other resses are
only 5 each so except for cold res (one of the easier ones to raise)
its far better. 

Jeez, it even really even kicks UMBRAL which is sk no drop plate armor
from fear.. thats NUTS. The umbral just has higher base resses of at
least 10 for the most part. Set of Cultural adamantite enchanted
imbued has 12 more ac, 18 more dex, 28 more int, 21 more agil, 6 more
str,  weighs 7 less  than UMBRAL. Again you just miss the plus 10 to
every res from the set.. which is kinda nice at a planes level.

So id take darkforge before any of the chain, but the enchanted imbued
plate is really nice.
