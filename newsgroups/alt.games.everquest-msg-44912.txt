You make it sound a lot worse than it is (not that I'm saying it's
trivial).

Goons aren't a problem during the daytime (and I've never encountered
one at night either, maybe I'm just lucky).  None of the skorpikis see
invis, and they're actually not difficult to avoid even when visible -
I've done the run down those canyons numerous times.

Getting to the entry temple is not at all difficult: enter the canyons
where the named skorps wait (very easy to avoid them), run down past
the double temples (one on each side of the canyon), then take a sharp
left.  Run to the end of that canyon, and the entrance is on the right
hand wall.  Run in, it's 1st right, 1st left, 1st right, 1st left and
down to the orb.

Invis is needed once you're inside the tunnels.  You don't wait around
outside the orb, you zone right in.  As long as you don't move once
inside, you won't get aggroed.  As soon as enough of the group are in,
start fighting: if the zone mobs are both sepulcher skeletons, that
means about 1000HP in HT damage, so get the aggro right.

OK, I suppose that's enough to put a lot of people off :-)  The VS
faction hit does make a difference, that's true.  But once you know
what to do, it's really pretty easy to get into HS.
