Theres a lot of nice people, and a good sense of community.  But if how you
judge that is by what people give you... and consider others "miserable
gits" if they don't give you things... then by all means stay away.   We've
already had way too many beggars running around.   ("Can u give me ur armor
plz?  I'm a new warrior, plz???  PLZ?!?")

Patches on Everquest can generally last longer than the estimated downtime,
and there is often an emergency patch that night or the next, since they
almost always manage to screw something up, sometimes seriously.   Other
than that though, the servers are remarkably stable, and there has almost
never been another time when I wanted to play but couldn't.   (The scheduled
patches are not all that common, except in the few weeks right after a major
expansion is released.   Maybe one or two a month)

Pvp is not a big part of Everquest.   On 90 percent of the servers, you
won't see it at all, other than perhaps a guild or GM sponsored tournament
in the arena.

Whether this is because the player base really does prefer zero pvp, or
because the game is balanced so horribly for pvp that it would never work,
is an issue occasionaly discussed in the newsgroup, but otherwise largely
irrelevant. ; )

In that event, you may want to forgo Everquest.  It is the intent of the
designers to "encourage" and sometimes outright force group dependence.
There are a few classes that can solo well, but for the majority it is a
process that is extremely slow and un-fun, if not outright impossible.  As a
warrior, solo against anything and I am dead.   With another person, we
might be able to kill some stuff, but the downtime and recovery time in
between fights would be massive.   The smallest group that I can really be
effective in is about 3 people.

Certain classes, such as Necromancers, Druids and Wizards, can easily go all
the way to level 65, the maximum level, without ever grouping with another
person.   But to do so limits you drasticly, and locks you out from even
seeing the majority of the game content.   If you can do the small group
thing, then you can see most of the dungeons, and the majority of the game.
But even then, there are some zones (and with the latest expansion, this
number increased drasticly) that you will never see unless you join raids,
massive multi-group killing parties, which can be a huge amount of people.
