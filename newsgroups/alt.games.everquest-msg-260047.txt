I'm not certain, but I think my mage was able to duck with eye on.  I 
know for a fact that he could stand up and sit down... and recall being 
very annoyed at autostand when they added it.

I'm not certain, because although I used the eye -constantly- (having an 
insta click eye of zomm item will do that to you), there weren't that 
many occaisions when I had to stop casting a spell as a mage; its rare 
that I'd start to do anything and then regret it in time to stop it.

Anyway, possibilities might be to experiment with your autoduck and 
autostand settings to see if they are stopping you.  You can easily play 
around with the eye and things like that in a newbie zone like 
shadeweaver's thicket
