Indeed. Once the precedent has been set, it's difficult to
back out of, and it would hurt the entire industry. There
may be hundreds of "also-ran" MMO's, but as game
types go, the MMO is still in its infancy. You look at
something that's been a lot more developed, like the
FPS genre, which is now gaining so much respectability
it's breaking out as a professional sport. This could only
happen because of the firm stance the makers of FPS's
took to protect themselves against cheating through the
use of middleware like PunkBuster, and enforcing
the integrity of their rulesets. In that an MMO is persistant
and any action has a greater set of potential ramifications,
those rules are even more sacred, and that's why no
matter what Yantis does, the solution from SOE's point
of view should not be to just cave because it gives them
an easier life, and they can get some money out of it
into the bargain.
