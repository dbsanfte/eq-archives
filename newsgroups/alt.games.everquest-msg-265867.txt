Do you include heterosexuality in that "etc"? Homosexuality is no more a 
choice than heterosexuality is. It has genetic and hormonal (and, 
allegedly, physiological) markers that are just now begun to be 
investigated, and it has been observed in most mammals and a great 
number of bird species.

Pedophilia may or may not be a conscious choice, I don't know, but its 
immorality does not arise from it being a deviation from the norm, but 
because it's, by definition, non-consensual, as children are incapable 
of *informed* consent.

Polygamy doesn't really belong in the group, as (like its less common 
counterpart, polyandry) it's a social construct, not a sexual preference. 
Now, if you are talking about sex with multiple partners, that's 
generally by choice, although in the infinite variety of human sexual 
experience, I wouldn't be surprised if there's someone out there who 
would be entirely unaroused by any single partner, no matter how 
attractive, but goes wild if presented with more than one.

Bestiality can be assumed to be a choice, as it generally overlaps with 
whatever happens to be the base sexual preference, without (generally) 
obscuring it; a form of assisted masturbation, if you will. Again, it 
may be that there is someone out there that is attracted to animals and 
animals alone, in which case it would not be a choice, but I'd think 
that is fairly rare.

42's example is apt. I remember left-handed friends of mine being forced 
in school (and I'm not *that* old yet) to use their right hands instead, 
and being punished if they reverted to what was natural for them. We see 
exactly the same mindless prejudice with regard to homosexuals, and *
that* is the true immorality.
