Sanjian, I don't know if you're aware of the meaning of the terms you use,
but "secular" means "apart from religion".  I hardly think that an
atmosphere without religion qualifies as an unconstitutionally established
religion.

> Why does your children's right not to see offensive religious practices
> trump my children's right to observe their faith?  What of the muslim

I really thought I'd made this clear... I have absolutely no problem with
your kids' exercising their faith.  They have every right to do so, as long
as other people around them do not have to stay and observe them.  While
it's not wrong for them to be around other people, those people should have
the option not to stay and listen.

> children who must pray at regular times?  Are they required to hold their
> prayers until the end of the school day?

Absolutely not.  They should be allowed to leave the room and pray.  But the
other children should not be required to sit and listen, nor should they be
forced to leave the room if they don't want to be present at muslim prayers.

> Or, to take another look, why is it that my child can be indoctrinated
into
> radical environmentalism, feminism, reverse-racism, anti-Americansim,
while
> they can't practice their faith?  Why is it that it's OK for a christian

I find your choice of evil doctrines interesting -- feminism (horrible,
makes me want to puke my guts out that women would want a say in what
happens to them), environmentalism (I can't imagine why anyone would want
the Earth to be a healthy place!), reverse-racism (who cares if you hate Jim
Crow, its when Jim Crow hates you that things are *really* bad! -- by the
way, I do *not* think reverse racism is ok, but I do find it amusing that
the policical factions that seem to be most in favor of segregation and
related racist policies are the ones who squawk the most when the black
folks turn around and don't like them), and anti-Americanism (this seems to
be a pretty general term for you, Sanji, seems like if anyone disagrees with
you they're anti-American, since you of course are the model of a perfect,
upstanding, righteous American).  And by the way, none of those things
qualify as religions, they are intellectual ideas.  Your kid has every right
to stand at the front of the class and read his essay on why he thinks the
earth was created by God in 7 days, but not the right to stand up at the
front of the class and pray over them.  If your kids had to hear people pray
to the gods of feminism every day then I coudl see your complaint.

> student to see to guys holding hands, but it's not alright for a
> non-christian child to hear a prayer?  All of these things happen in a
place
> where my child is forced to attend.

Nobody's forcing your kid to watch the two guys hold hands, and it's just
fine for a non-christian child to hear a prayer as long as he doesn't have
to stay and listen.

Sanjian, your arguments don't hold weight.  I have not yet seen you present
one belief to which you could show any basis besides blind faith or some
rather transparent variation thereof.  But, what the heck, I know you won't
change your mind... blind faith, not being based on logic, is rarely swayed
by logic...
