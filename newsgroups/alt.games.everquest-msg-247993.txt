That's Richard Garriot (aka Lord British), creator of the Ultima universe.
Easy for him to say, eh? He's right of course, EQ and most of the big MMOGs
will never become "mainstream" in the way this article means, given the kind
of investment players need to make in order to participate. City of Heroes
comes closer, but even that requires more commitment than I think most of
the mass market is willing to make.

Right now, the "game" that comes closest to hitting that AOL market is
something called "There" (referenced in the article). I've never played this
game but I've heard it mentioned often by other parents I know and I get the
feeling it's right at home with the AOL crowd. It'll be interesting to
watch. The biggest blown opportunity in this category is The Sims Online,
which should have been a license to print money. I mean, all they really
needed was to let you operate Sims in a nice-looking chat room and that in
itself would have killed There and established a beachhead. But instead they
delivered a "game' that was stillborn as a tedious nightmare requiring
endless running around and work, and the classic leveling treadmill. Morons.
