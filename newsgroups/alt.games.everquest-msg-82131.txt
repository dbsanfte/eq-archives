Very painless, and an incredible prize at the end.  My 42 ( hit 43 there ) 
warrior, a 48 Wiz, and a 38(?) Druid sat in the tunnel in Teneb Mntns. and 
just killed and killed while we waited on the Runner to spawn ( about an 88 
minute spawn ).  I got 2 yellows while we got 3 Runner kills.  Not the best 
EXP, but any time I'm sitting on a boring camp that I really want for a 
quest item and still get EXP, I'm happy.  As soon as we got there, th 
spawned, so we were there 3 hours and I got 2 yellow, along with 3 of us 
getting one of the 2 "Rare" drops for the quest.

Slaying Owlbears is easy in their cave for the Perfect Pelts.  Luckily, 
there was a nice druid there soloing, so she gave us the pelts.  She's on 
the "I'll go out of my way anytime to Clarity" list.

The result of the quest?  10-slot, 85% weight reduction bag that holds 
GIANT sized items.  Weight 1 stone.  And, YOU CAN SELL it if you want.  You 
and a friend could hold that runner camp for a while, with one of you going 
to do the Pouch turn-in.  You can make 6 of the bags ( lore, so will have 
to do in stages ), sell them for 2k or so each.

Of course, it would be quite rude to hold that camp while others want the 
runner, but if noone else is around at spawn time, gank the bastard.

My group was doing the CoM slaying, as usual, last night.  At Runner pop-
time, I logged real fast and logged in my Chanter who is bound at the 
runner, now.  The gal who gave us the Olwbear pelts was there with her 
friend waiting on the runner.  I told them it was going to pop in the next 
minute, claritied them, and was glad they got him.  I love it when someone 
is able to get something accomplished on a quest.
