I have hunted there a lot.
Those camps in the far SW corner are *Great* for say 18 through to
25/26.
I took my Druid (solo) from 24 to 26 there with no deaths.
I medded less than 20 meters from the camps and *never* got jumped.
I never even got trained.
I had to run to zone (about 200 meters) twice due to pops after my
harmony was cast.
And I made 2 levels and about 300pp in 2 days.

I think that a group of Tank,Healer,Druid + whatever could seriously
grind 8 levels there fast and safe.

Plus less lag than loio.
Hell it is even easier to get to (if you can camo/invis through the
warrens)

Now I just need to find a place to pull things from the woods for levels
26-29.
Any ideas ?
The adds and wanderers by the beach are bad.
You cant pull to the cat town gates cause of adds.

Is there anywhere else in zone that offers safe medding & pulling ?

Anybody ?

Cheers,

Jim
