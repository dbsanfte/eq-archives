I only have UO to compare EQ with, as UO is the only other online game I
have played. But in comparison, UO is so "flat" when compared to EQ. And I
do not mean just the Graphics.

My advice is dont worry about how big it is, just play. The game dumped you
in your starting city when you created your character. Start there, by
learning where everything is in that city. Browse the vendors, talk to the
NPC's. Do a little combat in the neighboring zones to your home city.

When you feel more confident, wander further, and further, and further...
and before you know it, you will know most of the geography and will have
met people who can show you where things are, or even (gasp) group with you
to go exploring a new zone!!

Above all, as a new player, dont be affraid to ask questions in /ooc or
here. The only stupid question is one you dont ask.

Welcome to EverQuest!!
