Why must they have arms to begin with?  That makes no sense to me.  Get a
bunch of people together.  Get well regulated.  THEN go buy some guns.
What's wrong with that plan?

I won't go into interpretation of the bad grammar of the Second Amendment,
I'll just say that your explanation of what it says wasn't clear enough to
me to win me over to your side.

BTW, I own a handgun 'cause I'm a boy and I like to make loud noises and
punch holes in paper.  I enjoy the ability to have the right to make loud
noises and punch holes in paper.  I can't honestly say that I'd be all that
upset if the government forced me to sell them my gun, but I WOULD be if
they didn't first give me the option of joining a "well regulated Militia."
