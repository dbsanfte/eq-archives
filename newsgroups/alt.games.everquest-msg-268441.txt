Yep, I wasn't really replying to the thread, merely saw the first half 
of the typical 'Zelda is for kids' argument and tossed a bit of a rant 
directed at a group of people who collectively [didn't like the graphics 
in Zelda because they were *not* not 'mature' enough (defining maturity 
along the lines of: realistic, gorey, ideally with T&A]/[think the 
GameCube is for kids because many high profile Nintendo titles feature 
cartoon stylings]/[think playing GTA3 is mature *because* they get to 
steal cars and it has more 'realistic' animation, etc].

Fair enough.

Sure. Have fun. Go nuts! I'm not even saying its 'less mature'. I just 
can't stand it when some twit tells me that its somehow "more mature".

You can tell me its more 'fun' (to you at least) and I won't even blink. 
You can tell me you prefer the look of GTA:VC to Zela:WW and I won't 
blink. Your entitled to your preferences, and I respect that.

But just don't try and tell me that because you play GTA:VC you are more 
'mature' than someone who plays Zelda:WW. 

**I never claimed YOU did say this, but there are no shortage of idiots 
who do, and they seem to like picking on Zelda:WW because of its 
styling. The styling in Zelda is deliberate and very well done. 
Critizing it for the way it looks is on par with as criticizing 
Picasso's "Man With Pipe" as being an 'immature cartoon for kids'.
