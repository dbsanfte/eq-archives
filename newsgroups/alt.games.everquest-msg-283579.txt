Started a dwarf pally, old school style.  First thought; its quite a run 
to BB, two zones from the paladin guild.  There are a few rats running 
around, but I mean very few, even down in the mine.  Loot on the 
skeletons outside is pretty cheap, I went after them about 50% of the 
time but never saw a single staff, weapons of any kind were rare in fact.

Rarer were items from the list for newbie armor, I got very few of the 
drops required despite making a point of killing only goblins, 
skeletons, scarabs and spiderlings; I suspect for the most part the 
drops require more difficult mobs than the ones on newbie hill.

Its a long walk to anything harder, though.

Killing skellies did yeild lots of bone chips, and there's a pally guild 
quest (doable by anyone actually) which takes 4 chips and hands out a 
little cash, some lowbie armor that fits, and some exp along with 
faction; other quests in the guild appear to take more faction, so this 
latter is important, moreso of course to non paladins (I've done this 
quest before, many times, with other characters who needed the faction)

Looking at spells, I was unable to find the level 1 spell, Salve, which 
is mildly annoying.  But much more annoying, I couldn't find Cease... 
and I suspect won't be able to.  I think it was added with Luclin.

This means a paladin won't have his basic "tons of stuns" functionality 
till much later in the game.  Looking at the progression, SK get their 
first pet at level 7, while Paladins get... nothing.

Second stun is at level 13, but its also a Luclin spell I think, funny 
thing is I seem to have named my character after it, but if this was a 
progression server I wouldn't be able to buy it for a year or so!
