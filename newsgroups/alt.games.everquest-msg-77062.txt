I have a lvl 15 halfling warrior who is modestly twinked. Yeah, she has
Langsaxes which are warrior only -- 4 of them in fact -- and some other
stuff which is warrior only... trouble is, I *hate* playing her now. I used
to take her out for a stroll when my ex was around and playing his necro,
but he's never around anymore and she's been in the box long enough that she
doesn't remember what sunlight looks like. As I've said in other posts, I
never group. I found, the last time I took her out for a run to FP, that if
you don't group, as a warrior, you pretty much die or run. And you pretty
much seem to be limited to wandering mobs. I also have a modestly twinked
lvl 5 cleric. I haven't played her either, in almost as long. I found that I
was not suited to the cleric calling as I have been to Druid, enchanter,
mage and bard. I have one more empty slot on my character creation list, and
I want to do something different... a ranger, maybe... or a necromancer...
but I can't figure out whether I should kill both cleric and warrior off,
kill only cleric off or kill only warrior off. (I'll want the cash and
items, in any event). And I doubt, unless someone tells me that it gets
better, it *really really* does, that I'll play my cleric much in the
future. I guess I'm asking for advice from higher level clerics and warriors
on this one, though I'm pretty sure I'm gonna off my warrior.

Anyone have any suggestions? (other than to take a long walk off a short
pier ;) ? )

Thanks for playing.
