Thanks for the link. I may print it as a backup reference, but the owner
of the site needs to update that quite a bit. At a glance, there's a
couple of Kunark necromancer spells missing. Also, right off the bat at
level 16, they list Umbral Messenger (gone) being produced by Words of
Materials and Spirit. That's actually the recipie for Hungry Earth
(undead root spell) which is not listed there.
