This brings up a point I have wondered about.  It's it against the PNP to
scam people out of exp. giving resses by offering a revive?  I have to admit
that the times I have been offered a rez by the group cleric, I never even
read the message, just click accept.  It would serve me right to have this
pulled on me I suppose.  Maybe if it was a stranger, I would pay more
attention...

So... assuming Verant frowns on rev in-lue res, why not have all lower types
of res's go away when you scribe the next higher one.  Is there any reason a
cleric would want to cast the lower level res once the higher becomes
available?  If verant can eliminate coin drops because of the firepot scam,
they could code the res line of spells to be "most only"

just a thought,
