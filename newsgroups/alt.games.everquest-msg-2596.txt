totemic helm requires to quest components, as well as ground dufrenite and a
medium banded helm
ogreskin chamois of a lizrd page in cazic thule, realitvely easy and common
drop
glacier bear pelt - of a glacier bear in everfrost, this one is a real bitch
spent a week camping this, knocking off the place holders 2 or 3 times a
day, 8 spawn, supposed to be a 1 in 3 chance of a bear, yea, right

my partner wasn't on, so my roommate came in with his cleric and we dropped
the bear easy the first time

7 hours later or so, my partner logged in, and as warriors have no way to
breath underwater, i went back in to lead him out
second bear popped right in front of us as we were headed out, kinda cool

this was after 8 days and 7 deaths to the lich for me and 5 for pipp, my
warrior partner

just so you understand why i think this is wortth 3k plat   :)
