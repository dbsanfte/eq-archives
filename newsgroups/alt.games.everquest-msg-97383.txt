EQ isn't tedious and boring as a whole.  But there are aspects that
are pretty damned boring in and of themselves though.  Tradeskills for
instance.  The thing is, the time invested is worth, or should be
worth, the out come.

Now, is the results worth the time invested, things tend to get a bit
more subjective there.

Note, that I did say subjectively speaking.  And a mage with a pet is
far, far from defenseless.  The can put out pretty nice amounts of
damage over a short period of time.  Melee classes can own them over a
long haul, but they also have a lot less utility than a mage.

I played a druid, and I did mainly solo, but I did a decent amount of
grouping (spent a good chunk of my 20's doing aviaks groups in SK, and
the low 30's to 40 in the old Cazic *sigh*).  And if the only way a
caster knows that a mob is incoming is by looking, then whoever is
pulling needs to be fired.  A good puller will announce ALL incoming
pulls, just like a tank should announce who he's bashing on.
Communication is VITAL in EQ.  Looking at the book while in a group
that has no communication skills should be the least of your worries.

Tedium was a maybe.  Hell, even boring is a maybe.  But that's the
disadvantage of the class.  You want mana back quickly, until you get
old (ie. skilled) enough, you're going to be looking at the book.  If
you're grouped, that means you are dependant on the others in your
group to give you the information you need to stay alive and
contribute to the group.  

Group interdependence is also one of the things that EQ is based on.
