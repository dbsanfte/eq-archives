I Don't think that umbra line does anything anymore.

In game under options (Alt-O pup-up window) choose lower settings
for spell and environment particles.

Also turn off Luclin character Models. This is done from the main
start up menu in EQ under options. This helps in raid situations where
lots of characters are around.

Also the /shownames command has several different levels to hide/show
names like titles, last names and guild names. This also helps frame rate
in raid situations. I like /shownames 1 to just show the first names of
characters. Just type /shownames alone to see a help list of the levels.

You can also change servers. Not all servers can be transferred to
however.

That is Left-click and hold, not right-click.

You can also make hot keys from inventory slots the same way.
To access bags and items from the hot-key panel.

Also if your character can use the forage skill you can forage many
nice things to sell in the bazaar that higher level players need for trade
skills.

Some things that NPC monsters are immune to might be nice for
a newbie to know: NPCs and monsters can't Drown, take falling
environment damage, or be burned by environment lava. They can also
'warp' (teleport intstantly) to you if they get stuck in the world geometry.

About maps:

If you have the Legacy of Ykesha expansion it is a real
good idea to get all the maps from eq-toolbox and load
them in your everquest maps folder. Everquest is a HUGE game
with over 200 zones, in game maps help you to get around.

Some map tips:

1. If you pull up the maps and can't see anything then zoom
the map out by clicking on the "-" button on the side of
the map, you man have to click this button many times, alternately
if you have a mouse with a scroll wheel you can hover your
mouse pointer over the map and zoom the map in and out with
the scoll wheel. Also turn off the height filter, this will show
all the lines on the maps.

2. If the map is hard to see because the lines are too light
then right click on the title bar of the map and change the 'Alpha'
'fade' and 'normal' levels to lighten the background of the map.
This allows you to see the map and the screen behind it so it
doesn't block your view. This is why so many maps are drawn
with grey lines.
