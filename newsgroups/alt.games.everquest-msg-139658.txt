not to sound like an illiterate, but wtf is that?

i actually looked it up, as i generally know english . .

is this more of that "ooh i make up words for effect" stuff? i won't be mad,
i'm just curious

bows to a superior lexicon

PS
btw, why are you making all this stuff up about gating and luclin? if this
is actual game lore, may i ask about death? dying in eq is fucking dumb to
me, is there a better explanation? . . .who could call this a role-playing
game, when after you die you simply appear, magically and without question,
with or without your worldly items, depending on a ranking that does not
exist (level) in any role play?

speaking of which, the idea that being struck inflicts numerical damage is
as opposite of role-playing as can be; how does that fit? you fall, walking
down steps when heavily encumbered, and take 6 damage . . . this is not a
role-playing game . . .
