Here's a *WEIRD* fucking zone for ya, kids.
:-)
We spent a couple hours with a single group there tonight. Kind of an
odd makeup: Warrior, cleric, rouge, druid, druid. Some switching later
with some others, but that was to start.

We didn't get in very far for our short outing, including two evacs and
trips back in. Did the entry, both routes around the first block, the
inner courtyard, the hall beyond and a few rooms that link off that
section. There's one area to the left as you come in where a trap door
spawns a mob or two every time you open it. Really nice when a "friend"
shows up to help and keeps opening the door. 
*sigh*
The other route takes you through a room where *YOU* keep changing
shape. I turned into a giant mushroom, Orlun was some sort of huge
cockroach, and one of our druids was an Earth elemental.

Oh, yes. THe mobs look differnet to all the members of your party. One
of our first ones turned out to appear to be some sort of zombie to me,
but it was a dark elf to Tiru and an Owlbear to Orlun and an elemental
to somebody else. Extremely confusing. 

Second time in, right at the entrance, I found a female halfling there
(forget name) who conned red and was a caster. We medded and buffed up
to full and I decided to pull her anyway. I tossed a throwing star at
her to pull her. She casts force shock on me (what is that? Like a 20th
level wizzy spell?) which I resist, and she immediately *DIES*. I take
seven faction hits, no xp, and she's gone. I'd have thought she was an
illusion if it weren't for the faction hits.

We got some decent xp, but no special loot to note thus far. Fun zone,
though. Kudo's to Verant. This place is confusing as all hell and a real
blast to explore!
