No, they don't "have to" be related.  But the Gravity Flux change was
presumably a nerf to prevent people from defeating certain terrain
barriers with it.  Since the Gravity Flux tricks I've heard of also
involve Levitate, I'm guessing that there is some terrain barrier in
PoP that they don't want circumvented in this fashion.  So, following
this line of thought, I wonder if nerfing the Levitate effect wasn't
their first try, and either it didn't fix the problem or too many
people complained so they nailed Gravity Flux instead.  [Note that I
assume PoP is involved because the CoM trick has been well known for
a long time, it would be rather odd to be nerfing it now.]
