You don't have to play with it on test, you can in fact run
testeverquest and set it to connect to regular servers with that
luclin GUI, then edit the EQclient init to the dx 8 file before going
in game.

So i was using it on my regular server and what I found was out and
alone it seemed faster but boy it really sucked ass when near like 5
people in velious armor. Also opening up my transparent inventory in
the great divide zone lagged the crap out of my mouse.. like it
stuttered across the screen. Not only that, but with it open people
running by in velious armor were like running in slo mo to me with
tons of frames skipping. When I removed the invis inventory it was
fine again. This was after just getting in EQ so it was still fresh.

I then camped and went back to DX7 and in the same spot had no such
troubles, did trans inventory and still had a fast mouse.. no slomo
people etc. 

This is on a tnt 16 meg agp, so I was not expecting spectacular
performance but it should not be WORSE. The thing is a person with a
geforce (would have same drivers as me sort of) was saying the exact
same thing about the mouse and stuff.
