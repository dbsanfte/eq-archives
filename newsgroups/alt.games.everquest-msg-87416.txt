Not much to disagree with there, except for the requirement
to not depend on others for ports.   There's generally enough
porters around where it's not *required* to have one in group
but it's a nice to have.

But there is here:

Warrior
Monk
Shaman
Bard

That's a far better group IMO.  It can still travel well and can
travel far better than your group until the wizard gets group
ports.  A bard can do fairly well at crowd control and he should
be more than adequate with a monk pulling.  It has three melee
damagers in the group and two people who can enhance that
damage, not bad for a group of four.  Healing power is lighter
than a cleric but that's not a requirement since they have both
shaman heals and, more importantly, Slow.   There's SoW in the
group to help the puller as well as Selos for longer travel.

Enchanters and clerics are both extremely good at what they
do but neither are needed in XP groups, especially one that
you're going to create.  Add in a wizard and you get a group
that's very dependent on mana and that's just inefficient.
