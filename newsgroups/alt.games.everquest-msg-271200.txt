Ok, I've looked all over the place trying to figure out what those token
things are and how I should go about getting them, but I can't find the
answer.  I sent an ooc in Freeport and some guy told me I could get the
tokens in the sewers.  The quest said the "ruins," but I figure what the
heck and I head to the sewers.  I fought there for like 20 or 30 minutes and
found no tokens, so I'm guessing that's not the place.  Do any of you know
where to go to get the tokens for the citizenship quest?  Thanks in advance.
