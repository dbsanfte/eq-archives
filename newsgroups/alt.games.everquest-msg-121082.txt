I just tried to point out lots of examples of intelligence and
adaptability in dogs.  My mind is open if you'd care to point
out examples of intelligence and adaptability in cats that
compares.

Your personal experiences are interesting, but I'm interested
in something a bit more proven and generally recognized, like
the things I mentioned.

That is, nobody can really challenge the fact that dogs can do
the things I mentioned.  You might say your cat understands
the General Theory of Relativity, but it's not really worth
bringing up unless it's generally recognized as something true.

We're not brain surgeons so nobody can win this particular
point.  I'll drop it if you will.  :)  (Well...one of us
probably COULD win...but that'd eat into our EQ time.  <g>)

I'm trying to point out that personal experience is interesting
but statistically worthless, as well as likely biased.
