I think what they mean is that it does get tougher above 53 , at 51
your druid has no less than 4 good quading areas. at 53 that falls to
3 and at 55 to zero cause everythings stinking camped. Same thing
applies to grouping players, too many bad camps not enough good ones. 

Losta people leaving and getting tired of the grind myself but new
ones arrive every day so VI doesnt really care. If people get hooked
on how the game plays at 1-50 why the heck do they change it in the
mid 50s? Im sure there is some reason but lets be honest if the game
played at level 20 like it plays at 55 no one would be playing. If the
game at 55 played more like the game at 20 perhaps fewer people would
be leaving although would be a heck of a lot of lvl 60s out there, not
a bad thing though. Be cool to have some uber guilds made up of people
that finished school, work for a living, and dont spend 30 hours a
week playing this game . Be nice I know there are exceptions to this
rule but on the whole no.

Ongoing problems are not being resolved, graphics problems,( Luclin
Lag Fest ), broken quests, BROKEN EPICS no less, broken mob cons, spaw
rates measured in real life days and weeks, and on and on and on.....

Going to take a break till PoP and hopefully some hunting areas clear
out a good bit. Buying DAOC today give it a try , seems to be a better
game for those of us with a life ). And no ya cant have my stuff,
unless ya bid on it LoL.
