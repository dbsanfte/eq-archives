}** Windowed Mode for the EverQuest front end **
}This patch introduces the ability for players to enter windowed mode at the EverQuest
}front end (from the time you log in until you get into the game).  With this
}addition, players will be able to run EverQuest in a window from the moment they
}click on the EverQuest icon to the moment they log out.

Thank you for buggering up my EQW again.  I really appreciate it. :) 
luckily the fix is out already.

}We have changed the way that Illusions and Shape Changes work with respect to
}faction.  The new system is a lot easier to understand than the old one, so we'll
}just explain the new one.  When changed into the form of a playable race, characters
}are treated as if they were a member of that race.  When changed into a non-playable
}race, characters retain their own racial factions.

Grr, and just before I was gonna start saving up for project illusion.  
The hole was gonna be so much fun...

}- Modified several of the Planes of Power alternate entry quests to make completing
}them faster.  Also, all of these quests will now give a "key" to everyone in the
}group of the person that completes it.

Now -this- I want to know more about.  Currently working on the HoH and 
Torment quests.  I wonder if the drops I have are good for anything now. 
:)  -Very- nice that I can flag my whole group, but it does mean 
HoH/Torment/CoD are about to get hit with a huge surging tidal wave of 
idiots, doesn't it?  Suppose it beats an empty zone though. :)
