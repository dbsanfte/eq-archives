Hmm, now I'm not a degreed clinical psychologist or researcher or anything
but....shouldn't a survey's data _support_ its authors' conclusions?

Quoting from the article: "The findings dismiss the stereotype of a
pimple-faced teenager locked in his bedroom. Instead, today's player is just
as likely to be a well-paid professional - male or female - aged in their
40s."

"Dismiss?" "Just as likely"? Well, not according to their survey, no. As
quoted in the article, their survey found that only 15% of EQ players are
female, and that almost 40% were under 20. They don't mention how many are
at least 30 or at least 40, but if two-fifths aren't even of drinking
age....Sure sounds like mostly young males to me.

And I love this quote from the author about "excessive" EQ-playing: "But it
is okay for someone who is not in a relationship and does not have other
responsibilities." Let's think now, what age group does that sound like....?

More seriously, it appears that this data is taken from self-selected
respondents: EQ players who responded to a call for volunteers to fill out a
questionnaire. Isn't self-selection the most basic distorter of survey
samples, the cause of the most spectacular failures in the use of surveys
and polling to assess the nature of specific populations? Doesn't
self-selection basically disqualify any survey from publication as
peer-reviewed science?
