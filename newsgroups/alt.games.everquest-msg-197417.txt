	No, not really.

|Games ARE work, for a particular reward.

	No, they are not.

	The only meaningful definition of work is: if you have to do it whether or
not you feel up to it, it's work.  EQ does not meet that definition -- ever.
(Though Rumbledor would like it to, it seems, with his loony ideas of how
guilds should take on the trials.)

	It was nothing more than a prize in a game.

	I am on E'ci.  The E'ci public raid force is large, rapid to mobilize,
high level and well-geared.  They just made it into SolRo last week.  (I'm off
public raids because, due to the large number of people who want to
participate, membership now requires level 65 and I don't have the large
blocks of RL time needed to level rapidly.  I just hit 63 a few days ago.
Frankly, it's more fun to play my newbie on Stromm, or level up my Ranger on
Test so I can see new content ASAP.)

	Keep in mind, as well, that anyone who can get to Storms can eventually
get to Tactics.

|Flags are a great idea that was not implemented correctly, thus
|destroying badly put-together guilds (aka, guilds with an
|"every-man-for-himself" point of view)

	You could not possibly describe the Arbiters as having that point of view,
modulo a few cretins we let in who just want us to get them their epics so
they could PM the local munchkin guild.

|who could not see the fact that, in your words, "this is a game".  PoV
|and PoS, I can see opening - but the opening the other zones merely

|the larger PoP quest.

	It's not an accomplishment.  You want accomplishments, go climb a
mountain.
