I have done the first two quests from the roll of silk in the tailor
room in RoV, and now I want to do the 3rd one.  I have to take the
silk to a merchant in Qeynos.  Being an evil dark elf, I can't exactly
wander around the town looking for the right one.  Can someone tell me
where this particular merchant is, and how I can most safely get
there?  Thanks.
