More like the imprefection of languages.

The difference is, the media has a want to group true christians with those
who only claim to be christian, whether or not it's accurate.

Some of it does, I'll admitt.  Some of my 'brethern' have no clue what the
true teachings of the Christ were, and only know what they hear from Pat
Robertson and Jim Baker types.  This, however, isn't the biggest problem.
There are groups out there who would use and abuse Christianity for their
own purposes, much in the way Bin Laden and Saddam Hussain abuse Islam for
their own gain.  It's not about religion for these people; religion is only
a convienant cover and a way to rally those who don't know any better.  It's
these people, who abuse the faith of others' who I consider to be 'evil' in
every sense of the word, much in the way that the pedophile priests in the
Catholic Church are evil.

Ok, then, I think we have come to an understanding.  If you were a
christian, once, then you must recall seeing the walls slowly close in from
the mass media, and feeling as if there was no longer a place for those who
follow Christ, as the secularists slowly whittle away our freedom of
religion.
