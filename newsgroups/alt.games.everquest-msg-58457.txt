For 2hs I would spare up for a Babs (Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword). Goes
for roughly 300pp these days and is 24/39, +5 vs poison.

1hs has lots of options, but the Bals (Blackened Alloy LongSword), also from
Runnyeye, is a good one to start with. It's 10/29, +5 vs poison.

And I'm sure others will give more options (like that 11/29 claw from GD?)
