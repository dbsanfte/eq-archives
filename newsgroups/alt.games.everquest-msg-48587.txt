From someone elses post if you make an iksar and go to the lake of ill
omen newb area instead of field of bone (your default bind) you will
be doing well with fewer people. 

Halas and the qeynos area are the most crowded I've ever seen them
with 145 newb barbarians in everfrost, 150 or so newb humans in
qeynos, 150 or so in qey hills. If you do quests and such to gain a
foothold fast (since finding something to kill is hard.. may as well
not bother ) you can get out into WK where there are only 19 people
pretty fast though. My barb shaman did like 6 quests including 3 barb
mails to qeynos (wk barb area, halas, surefall), clover shipment (got
a polar bear cloak for that once.. very rare though mostly get your
spells so you don't have to buy them until level 9), lion meat
delivery and buying all the bone chips in halas for the qeynos pally
guild great quest ;)


>What are the least occupied/most rewarding zones?'

I'm sure druid is the most over populated. I'd think lake of ill omen
would be quite rewarding now.


>Do the new restrictions really make it THAT much more difficult?

Not yet, but when we can bind but can only bind in cities even if a
caster it will be. For example.. wk is a long run from halas and I was
thinking "oh when 14 I can kill spiders in EK!" then I rememberd that
I will have to be bound in rivervale or something Or at that gypsy
area in North karana (which at level 14 even though I could sow self
would seem daunting.. lot of griff HG traffic there.)

That will be the hardest rule in the whole game, especially eventually
when raiding and even your res cleric has to be bound at a city
somewhere. I did get one good idea though, as a shaman could bind in
FV starting at level 19 or so and take the boat out to the nearest
point it passes to the firepots, jump off, lev/sow (presuming you had
batwings in bank or buy in FV if you can) and take firepots to the
other cities (of course they don't have  firepot to qeynos/halas = / )


>I am thinking of a High-Elf either Enchanter or Cleric. Any opinions?

Cleric will be nice. Eventually there are never enough clerics or
enchanters to go around.

Shaman even gets rare at the high levels and they are also very
needed.
