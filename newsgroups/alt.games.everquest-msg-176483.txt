Hmm, the general consensus I have always seen is that taunt, when
successful, puts you immediately at the top of the hate list, when
unsuccessful, does nothing.  This could easily cause people to think it is
gradual, as a few failures followed by a success would look like it
gradually moved you up.  The reason that you should always taunt several
times before breaking a mez for instance, is to have a better chance at
having at least one successful taunt.  It is never guaranteed though, so,
you could see instances where on the same mob, with the same spells having
been cast on it, and the same number of taunts, that it sometimes goes after
the mezzer anyway, and sometimes not.
