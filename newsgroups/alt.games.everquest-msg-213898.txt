No, I did not miss it at all.  I was responding to your assertion
that Darkness did so, in a context (comparing Darkness to Snare)
that implied that this was something that made Darkness better than
Snare.  If you are not claiming that, then why mention it at all
in defense of your claim that Darkness line is superior?

Of course.  And Snare/Ensnare is usually the second and sometimes
the first spell my Druid casts when engaging solo.  I'm not arguing
that the Darkness line is useless, it's a snare and snares are
valuable, but snares that don't break mez are much more valuable in
a group setting, which is why Snare/Ensnare is more highly regarded
than the Darkness line.  For that matter, even soloing a Necro or
SK the DoT component of Darkness line is a disadvantage when you
need to FD, and for a Necro prevents you from mezzing a mob while
it's snared.

/sigh
In a group it is very handy to be able to debuff mezzed mobs before
you wake them, a Necro or SK is not able to debuff movement speed
without waking the mob.  In a group you sometimes have to deal with
very chaotic situations where it is not always possible to be
completely aware of everything everybody is doing, a Druid or Ranger
can Ensnare mobs without worrying about breaking any of the mezzes
that the Enchanter or Necro is casting to get the situation under
control, but if you Darkness a mob it cannot be mezzed.  It's not
about 14 minutes.  OTOH, that long duration is nice when you are
dealing with a multi-mob pull or some idiot's train and you'd like
to make sure all the mobs are snared so that the Enchanter (or Necro)
doesn't have to worry so much about being smushed on a resist.

As far as "waste of mana" goes, it isn't too often you worry about
a 35 mana spell (Ensnare) that you cast once per mob.

Snare and Ensnare are cheap, fast casting, slow movement more than
Darkness (I've been in groups wiped by adds because a mob fleeing at
20% health was not stopped cold by Darkness, Snare or Ensnare would
have prevented that), and because they do no damage they do not
break mez.  Let me repeat that one more time, as you've ignored it
every time it's been pointed out to you by me and others before me:
Snare/Ensnare stack with mez, Darkness-line does not.
