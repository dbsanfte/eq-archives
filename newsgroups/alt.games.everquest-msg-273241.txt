...it would be.  Adds are tough to deal with, you would need to buy
several ITU potions, no harmo, can't root/shoot, and even if they only
hit for 100 or 200, it begins to take its toll after a while.

Do shaman get ITU?  In any case, the mix of the two is no problem.  Reg
invis to the first ramp.  Pause at top and ITU.  Top of stairs in front
of golems, regular invis, on wall near Shopkeepers, ITU again.  You can
get through the entire zone with no agro (aside from the dragon in the
theatre or maybe the highborn/epic mob in with them) if you can both
ITU and regular invis.
