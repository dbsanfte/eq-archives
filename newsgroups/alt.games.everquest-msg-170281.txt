See, the thing I've never understood is why someone would want a builtin 
mp3 player when I have a perfectly serviceable CD player right next to the 
computer that doesn't make any of the software more complicated or 
crash-prone.

That said, though, I've had some great raids accomanied by my Best of 
Gilbert & Sullivan album.  But it may just be an enchanter thing.
