Correct.

It doesn't matter if he was there first. He doesn't get to apply
rights and privileges to areas and drops in the game because nobody
happened to be there when he got there.

He has 0 'rights' to any drop in the game up until he engages the
spawn that drops it first. Nobody promised him a rose garden.. they
didn't etch his name on the ass of his spawn and say this is yours.
All he need do is attack it first on spawn.

What really peeves me is when people try to assign 'rights' and
'priveleges' to mobs based on subjective rules designed to give them
an unfair advantage in order to increase their odds of getting a drop.

If another party wishes to agree with you to adhere to this 'camp'
philosophy then that is their choice. But that does not make it any
more or less valid. And kill/stealing to try to 'prove' your camp are
tactics of the infirm and retarded.

Or.. how he griefed newbs. Nothing that he mentioned that they did
even constitutes a 'grief' by them. They were playing the game and he
didn't like the fact that when they started killing mobs in what he
considered 'his' area they didn't get his holy writ concerning it
first. That is *NOT* griefing.

Guess what.. yes. That *IS* how EQ works. But if you've been waiting
for it to spawn.. are you in any way not going to attack it at the
earliest possible instant, especially if you know someone may be in
the area? All you need to is be the first to engage and petition
anyone who tries to come in over the top and K/S, or trains you while
you are engaged. An example of this you could wait 15 hours for the
Fennin Ro ring to spawn with 40 people.. 30 minutes before it comes
up.. 20 people in another guild walk in the area.. it pops and they
engage while you are buffing to kill it. Whose spawn? Theirs,
regardless of if they had the people to complete the ring because they
then have 20 more getting coth'd/running. He who attacks a spawn first
with enough people to kill it gets it. If its not you, you are SOL if
it goes to GM's.

Granted.. these issues usually pop up a lot closer to endgame and
raid-level targets.. but the rules GM's use to arbitrate are the same
on those as are on the rares in Crushbone. Just simply engage first.

I tend to find that the people who KS in Crushbone usually have no
issues with doing it in other places. Its one of those things.. low
low percentage that you get caught while doing it.. but when your
number comes up the GM's will put your tit in the wringer if they do
catch you at it.

>lol. Maybe once upon a time when they gave a damn. But 
>not today. (music in background) It's a free for all. (continue music 
>for a while)

Oh.. they still give a damn.. the stars just have to align and a *GM*
has to be on, in the zone, and catch you in the act while you are
doing it.

I reference the retards of the guild formerly known as Severed on
Fennin Ro. This gem of a time-level guild felt the need to go back to
3 year old content and KS guilds left and right on AoW/Tormax/Cursed.
They finally did it so many times and so often that a GM ended up at a
Tormax spawn when another guild was doing it. He was stealthed and
ended up catching them red-handed. By the time they were done half of
the guild members were suspended with the previously banned GL was
rebanned on another account.

They do care.. its just so rare that they actually get the evidence.
And what goes around will come around.
