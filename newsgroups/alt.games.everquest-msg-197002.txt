Ok. Here we go again. There have been numerous discussions on this board 
and many others about pulsing mana songs. The concensus has been that a 
person will only benefit from one mana pulse every tick. Therefore, 
pulsing it repeatedly is ineffectual. Granted, you will see the mana bar 
climb at an amazing rate, but that first spell or two cast afterward will 
bring the bar down more in line with what the caster actually has left in 
their pool. The additional mana they appeared to have has been referred 
to as "phantom mana". I have done some very cursory tests on this with 
group mates a couple times, and whereas one said they didn't notice that 
first spell to take any more mana than normal, the second claimed that it 
took substantially more. From what I've read, heard and experienced, I'm 
inclined to accept this as truth pending stronger evidence to the 
contrary. 

I will try two-boxing my 40 bard and 24 shadowknight tonight and try a 
test seeing how many times I can cast my pet with a normal full mana bar 
obtained by simply leaving the mana song playing versus a full mana bar 
obtained from pulsing the mana song. I will try to post the results soon.
