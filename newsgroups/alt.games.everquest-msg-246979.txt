Just about all, if not all, of those blocked accesses are people
"knocking". I haven't had ZA on my computer since changing systems
because I've been too lazy to install it, and haven't had any such
"strange things" turn up. Unless you've actively attracted the
attention of hackers, chances of someone hacking you are probably less
than someone breaking down your front door and robbing your home.

Yeah, it's good to be careful. But you're being absolutely paranoid,
which is just...neurotic.
