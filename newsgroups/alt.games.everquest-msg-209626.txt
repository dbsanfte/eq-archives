Defensive is a raid discipline.  It has little to no use in a regular
experience group.  (1)

In an experience group, when the excrement has collided with the rotating
oscillator, you're much better off using the 56 discipline, Furious.
(Riposte all hits for 10 seconds)





(1) - Which isn't to say that having defensive won't help you get groups.
It very well might.   I'm sure theres a significant amount of people that
don't understand how much it sucks in an exp group.  Of course, considering
that they're likely the same people that believe a druid is incapable of
being a healer in a high level group, is that really a group you want to be
in?
