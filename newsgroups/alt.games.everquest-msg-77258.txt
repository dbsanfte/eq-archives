Guys you have to spread the word, that is all i ask, there are thousands of 
EQ players out there who are sufforing major FPS problems, please thats all 
i ask in return for the information.  Make sure you put at least 1 shout out 
and let everybody know what do to.

P.S.  To the person who said his card didnt support it! its actually 
software that determines what to send to the card, the umbra engine 
process's the scene and then sends the relevant data to the card, so it 
dosent matter what card you have.  Im well aware that some people will not 
benefit, but a lot are seeing benefits its only fair you let them know.
