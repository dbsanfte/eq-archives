The ring (used to be a straight 15% reduction in cast time)
now only works on spell cast times 4secs - 9.5 secs.  There
was a huge uproar in FoH (a Furor even, hmmmm) about reducing
cast time on C. heal to 8.5 seconds and how it was going to
"trivialize" encounters.

The bracer still seems to give a max 20% increase to DD's
(variable, average is probably around 10% if the damage
bonus is evenly distributed).

I don't know if they changed the choker or not - only a
matter of time.  With it on there is a 15% chance of not
using a reagent.  The thinking is that a high level enchanter
can use this with enchant velium.  Buy 100bars, enchant until
you run out of reagents.  (should get 117 enchanted bars out
of it, on average.)  Sell 117 bars back and rake in the
dough.
