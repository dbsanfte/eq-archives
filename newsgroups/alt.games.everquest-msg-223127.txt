Ok, I copy and paste from the Homepage, right at the top of the news
secton...


Aario was kind enough to email the following solution for the problem
of no 3D target ring while using Custom UIs

quote: 
Make sure 3D Target Ring is ON in the option menu inside the game.
Copy TargetIndicator.ini and TargetIndicator.tga to your custom UI
directory(s).
EQ is looking for those files one time only, and that is when it loads
your first character. The files must be copied outside of EQ (be
camped out to desktop). Using a /loadskin will not bring the rings
into action if the files are copied over while in game. 


hope this helps
