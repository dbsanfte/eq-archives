OK, this is a different kind of question.   My lvl 7 Cleric, yes he is a
Froglok too, died last night in EC near the Orc camp.  I was attacking Lions
and Scarabs and Bears, oh my.  I get attacked by about 4 or 5 at a time.  No
problem I think, lvl 7 I will just start over at my Bind Point.  I get
poisoned by something, never saw what it was, and get the message:  You are
in pain.  You are bleeding to death.  You died.  Returning to bind point.
My screen flashes, tells me I am in EC, my bind point, and I see me dying on
the ground right where I was and get the same message.  I fially had to
control-alt-delete to get out of this loop.  I log back on and try my CLE
again and still the same thing.  I never could make this work.

Who do I contact?
Will it reset?  (I have not logged on yet but I will after I send this post)

Thanks for all the help.
