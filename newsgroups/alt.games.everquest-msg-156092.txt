I had messed up texture files once too.
It gave me lots of interesting psychedelic effects. Like the treants of NK
had instead of bark texture a face as texture.
I think it was my face actually (Or atleast my halfling druids' face).

And i had faceless orcs everywhere. I might have screenshots of that
somewhere..
