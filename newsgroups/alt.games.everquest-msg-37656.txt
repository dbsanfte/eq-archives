Personally I rarely work the street corner res business, there are better
ways to make money, and you get exp and skill ups while you do it.
Still, there are times when I'm mostly AFK, and its nice to have some
cash and faction (players) build up while you hang out.  While I'll res
for free under most circumstances, I find I still make a lot of money
from people who donate anyway... although I often whine when they
force me to take cash instead of paying in ale as requested.  If I'm
purposefully trying to make cash at it, I stop asking for ale, still don't set
an amount, still res anyone who asks...bottom line though is that I'm not
walking, find me a port if you need me to travel far.

The key here is that you have only the 39 res.  People under level 30
really shouldn't be getting a res at all, while people over level 45 will
probably only consider your res a last ditch replacement.   Although some
of the best res money is in dreadlands/Karnors, say, you won't see much
of it, since people there will be looking for (and probably finding) a 49 res,
or even a 56 res/stick res.

You need to stick to zones where there is money but high level clerics
are very rare.  Lake of Ill Omen/FM would be an excellent choice,
as you see a lot of secondary characters working there, and yet higher
level clerics are exceeding rare, as its not near a port, there are
no native Iksar clerics, and there's a high rate of train related deaths.
Best strategy to make cash doing this would be to advertise a set price,
say 50pp, since otherwise you'll be beset by the lower twenties guys
who are also working LOIO but think that 10pp is a huge amount of
money.

Rathe Mountains is a good choice too, except that there's no zone
line to another hot death area.  Still, there's so much money falling
off giants that non-twinks can reasonably afford 50pp, and as
a bonus you could actually play between res, instead of just whoring.

Do -not- fall for the guys that say "paying well" for a res... what they
inevitably mean is in the 10 to 20 pp area.  If they meant "paying
100pp they'd say so, not stating an amount is like not telling you
whats available in the champagne room.

As a 52 cleric, I laugh out loud at the people who are "paying well."
I'll res for free, but "well" would be amounts over 1000pp... otherwise
I could probably make more money soloing in the time it takes to
go do your little res project.

If you want to make money doing res, then role or anon don't make
a whole lot of sense.  Whenever I'm in the mood to do this, I actually
auction to the zone...  hiding your light under a bushel will only get
you access to the people that /ooc, /shout, or /auction hoping someone
will respond.  You'd be amazed how many people don't do this,
don't look for a res at all, just loot up and go on with their lives.

Personally, I wouldn't be fanatic about looking for one, but spending
a little effort and a little pp to save all the time an exp would return...
well, people who get their first res from me at 50 still amaze me.

/auction Have 50% res will travel

is the way I used to put it, using the auction key at least puts it
in their heads that this might be a cash transaction.

Another good one for when I'm in a group

/auction Res prices 2cp if you drag body to me, 2kpp  I will come to you.

Translation: I'm not leaving my group to die just to give you some
exp back, you do the hard part and I'll do the bare minimum, when
and if I get the mana free.

The cleric bracers quests are trivially easy in your low thirties, no need to
wait for 39, unless you mean "I"m in a hot exp spot and I'm not budging."
I'm amazed at how good those things are, by the way, given that the
whole rest of the gold outfit sucks eggs... I just got my first Hate drop
armor, the bracer... and it is the same AC as the gold, no wis.  Guess
I'm still wearing the golds I got at 30.

Likewise, why buy guantlets of the black?  At 39 you'll be a welcome
addition to many a RyGorr group, when you get into a mid 40s that seems
tight enough to handle Firebrand, go for it.  Oh, and by the way, the
battlemail off the chief isnt' too shabby either, the lack of wis is made
up for to some extent by the mana boost.  Don't buy things you can
easily get for yourself, buy the rare drop items, not the common drops.
