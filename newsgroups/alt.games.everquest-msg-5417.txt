There is a merchant in LOIO that will buy from you he is at the windmill I
have a gnome necro and he sells to me. I just would make the run to
overthere to buy when I needed to once a week or so would get a sow and then
run like a wolf. I would cast invis to run through overthere zone  and I was
fine never got attacked. Overthere was great from Lvl 18-21
