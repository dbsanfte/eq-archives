Interesting.  I'm not certain, but I think that's the way it used
to work.  It has been a long time (nearly three years) since I
tried Root/Shooting mobs with my Paladin, but I had Root break on
almost every hit with an arrow.  Could have been coincidence, I've
been bitten by that more than once, but after trying it a number
of times with invariably disappointing results I gave up the tactic.
