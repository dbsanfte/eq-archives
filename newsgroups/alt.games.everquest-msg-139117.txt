Well, I must confess, I just took a little sidetrip to 
rec.arts.theatre.musicals .  They don't appear to have any sort of a 
standard at all, from what I can make out.

This does, of course, make it very difficult to read.  But who am I to 
tell them they're wrong.  Thank Brell we have a standard over here. :)
