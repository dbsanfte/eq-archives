Just butting in to point out that the legal definition of a "life sentence"
is not "for the rest of the convicted's life".   The length of life
sentences varies according to particular state, and it's almost always
between 25 and 40 years.  I know in Minnesota it's 30 years, or at least it
was 6 years ago when I witnessed a capital case result in a guilty verdict.
So when someone receives a "life sentence without parole," that means
they'll be in prison for 30 years.  Consecutive life sentences (Like Terry
Nichols) can mean that a convict can receive longer sentences (he got a life
sentence for each person killed by the Oklahoma bombing, which would keep
him incarcerated even if he managed to live for another 1000 years).
Sentencing guidelines dislike the imprecise manner of "until the guy dies".
