Neat, didn't think it had a remove curse component.  I may ditch using the
remove curse spell at all.  Gotta get greater remove curse someday.  :)

There is some boss mob with a curse in Ssra that can be removed by greater
curse with one cast that will, in my experience, *never* be cured by regular
remove curse.  I'm not sure how or why that can be, but it's the way it's
worked for me.
