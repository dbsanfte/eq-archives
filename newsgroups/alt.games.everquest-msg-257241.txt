There is a wealth of information out there on EQ2 game mechanics.  Only
thing is, it isn't in the videos. IE, you have to read it.

And you would never ever look at the pretty pictures without reading the
interviews, riiiight Melduhr? ;)

Anyhow, I didn't bother clicking the links because I've seen just about
every EQ2 video that has come out, and I assume I won't see them first
here.  BUt I'm sure they are good. ^_^  And it's fun to watch people still
discovering the game.  It has its flaws, but it's shaping up to be a good
product.
