You were correct, provided you didn't badmouth the cleric (especially in
group say). Interesting how the cleric thought he/she was doing well. It
takes 10 seconds to cast complete heal; get interrupted once and there isn't
time to do it again.

What to do? Remember who the cleric was and don't group with that person
again. But, don't badmouth them (or their guild) either.
