I don't know about that.  I do have to give Brad credit for his explanation and
having at least *some* rationale behind it.   Having one person get something
quickly, cheaply, easily while somebody else has to work their ass off and risk
dying to get the same thing *might* be seen as a valid reason for having such
rules.  Of course, the immediate nagging question that brings to mind is, "then
why do you allow twinking, Brad?".  You still have a bunch of actual newbies in
patchwork watching some other level 3 warrior in full crafted with a wurmslayer
running by.  (Please, please, let's not start the twinking debate here again.
I'm doing it myself already, and we all know the case *might* be made the the
player's previous character "earned" the items, etc.)
  Point being, it's once again contradictory.  As to the comments of
"endangering the ecomony of the server" I've never heard anything more laughable
in this whole discussion. Just about everything in EQ, be it coin or items, is
available in *unlimited* supply.  How many ghoulbanes do you think suddenly
sprang into existance across the servers since the new quest was put in place?
What's the difference if one item or bucket of cash suddenly came in a little
earlier or later for one player? There may be some reason buried deep in a
mountain of code, but I sure couldn't begin to guess what.
  But all in all, I still don't think there's much of a debate left over *why*
there are anti-exploit rules. Only about the haziness of the definitions, the
seeming randomness of how different GM's and guides will interpret those
guidelines, and the level of severity that TPTB will employ to come down
unleashing godlike fury and anger on you if your run afoul of those shifting
lines.
