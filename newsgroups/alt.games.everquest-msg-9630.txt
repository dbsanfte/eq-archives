I've looked for myself, Lokari. I don't have the patience nor
fortitude to wade through 4 years of Ronnie's shit... but from the
little I saw, Melon's "suspected" list is at *least* 80% accurate.

I'm 100% certain the person posting in this newsgroup is the same
person who frequented alt.cracks; any comments on that, seeing as how
you're a developer yourself?
