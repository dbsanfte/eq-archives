(Note, I don't play a druid or ranger.)

I have spent a LOT of time in WC, and I have never, ever,
ever had a druid NPC get irate when I killed the wildlife
right by the druid rings, nor have I ever seen anyone else
get attacked for it.

On the other hand, I've been killed twice for merely
getting attacked by a bear while sitting near the NK
druid rings, and have watched a lot of other people meet
their demise in a similar manner, even though I've
spent probably 1/50th of the time at the NK ring as
at the WC ring.
