For someone who talks as big as you do and insults as many
knowledgable people as you do, you sure are full of shit. You don't
need Rallos flag to get into the tower of sol ro.

That's a much more honest mistake than your other posts, including
such gems as "if I don't play the class it must suck" and "taunt isn't
very much aggro", but really, when your foot gets put in your mouth as
much as yours is, you might want to try keeping the mouth shut once in
a while. You seem to be screwing up in every single post you make.

One begins to wonder if you have any first hand knowledge of any of
the things you are talking about at all, or if you're just trying to
bullshit your way through everything....
