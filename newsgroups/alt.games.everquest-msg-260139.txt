Isn't this Blizzard's first "real" MMORPG, though?  Blizzard has total
control over the server side.  Unlike Diablo II, where Blizzard only
controls the metaservers.  Aren't Diablo II games actually hosted on
player's computers?

That is, I'm assuming (please correct me if I'm wrong) that it'll be
harder to hack something like WoW than it was to hack something like
Diablo II.  Although, I'm sure lots of people will still try.

Raph Koster hasn't impressed me since the early UO days.  He denied
reality and instead insisted his theories must be correct.  When he
let PK'ing run rampant and suggested players police themselves and
then started implementing some watered-down solutions to the problem,
I knew UO wasn't for me.

But then again, I don't like PvP at all, so I'm biased.

At least there doesn't appear to be any shortage of MMORPGs to choose
from.  :)
