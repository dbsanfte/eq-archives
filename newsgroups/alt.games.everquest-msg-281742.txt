Now if someone from  SOE staff would post *here* a warning,that using
those exploits will get you banned from the game they could get back
some credibility.
What about taking some legal action from SOE's against this guy?
Crap like this hurts the game's reputation badly,and SOE is silent?

Probably they are too busy making another half-broken,unbalanced,
buggy expanasion.

*sigh*
