How about... I paid 30 bucks for the expansion based on the fact that
I thought I would be getting a lot more utility out of the tribute
system. I don't have 60+ characters on the server I play on these
days... so the new zones and AAs don't hold any immediate value.

I fully expected the nerf bat when i saw some of the tribute prices,
and now, as you said ... it looks like I'm going to have the same
stats I had before the tribute system...  and I'm 30 bucks out of
pocket for the priviledge. I would have at the very least delayed the
purchase of GoD... and depending on what happens in the mmrpg
landscape in the coming months... might never have ended up with it at
all.

Its not a "disaster", but I'm irritated enough to complain ;)
