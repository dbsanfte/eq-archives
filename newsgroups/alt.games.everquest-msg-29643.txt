Id be bitter too if they kept fixing the machine while I was playing
it. I still think that if IBM had left Deep Blue as it initally went
it, Kasparov would have won overall. I dont know - altering it while
he is playing it? (in the sense of the five matches, not during actual
game-time) That strikes me as just a little bit of cheating...
