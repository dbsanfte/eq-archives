You don't get the faction hit from getting the gem. You get it from
turning it in to the barb in NFP.

I bound myself and a chanter in the NFP tunnels next to the barb shaman
NPC and we went ported to GFay and ran to Pegleg's camp in BB. Killed
pegleg and the dog spawns. He won't talk to you until you are
indifferent, so initially the chanter had to charm him. Then he talked
to me and gave me the gem. We both gated to NFP where I opened the trade
window to give the gem to the barbarian. Before I hit "give", the
chanter invis'd me. Then I hit give and got the faction hit. Then Port
back to GFay and rinse repeat.

Have him keep checking faction until he gets to indifferent when not
invis. At that point, he can do both sides himself with no charming and
no invising needed. I got to amiable that way in one evening's tedious
running around, and I encountered no difficulties with the turn-ins when
I got my epic.

Hope that helps.
