I hate Prima.  IMO strat guides went to shit shortly after manuals, but some
of the stuff they release...its fucking pathetic.  A grade school english
teacher capable of turning on a console could do a better job than their
editors.

That being said.

I read the sample for the Prima EQ2 guide, its online at their site, its a
walkthrough of the starter island.  It was not bad.  It seems like it will
have very detailed quest info, which could be a relief as going from WoW's
!/? system to EQ2's hail everyone and hope for the best has been a painful
adjustment.

Also, the fact that it is coming out AFTER the game is promising.  Usually
it is the reverse, and it shows.  To wit, there is a sample of the Brady
guide (who usually does a better job than Prima, IMO) for WoW in the most
recent PC Gamer.  Its based on information prior to the most recent patch,
which made a number of significant changes to classes, and so this
information, class templates and strategies for playing them, is outdated
and severely devalued.
