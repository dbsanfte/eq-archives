www.everquest.com is the official site, and although pretty it is pretty
useless.  Down somewhere on that page is a link to the USEFUL site but here
it is:
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/

I've never played Baldur's Gate but after playing EQ for 2.5 years and
seeing very few posts about BG here I'm GUESSING that you really can't
compare the two.

I saw that SOMEWHERE you can get a free original version (it doesn't have
the 2 expansions) + 10 hours free...that was posted in the NG somewhere, but
I forget where to go to get it.  You can check out the average price by
seeing how much sony sells it for (using either of the above links).  I'm
guessing around $29.99 but it's a total guess.

Subscription price (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually) is, at most, $9.89/mo
(monthly).  I think I'm paying $25.89 quarterly.

It's a very immersive world.  Some would call it addicting.  If you have a
life I'd recommend a game that doesn't take such an emotional/mental
commitment.  www.darkageofcamelot.com is a really good game for those who
just want to fart around in a game filled with people from all over the
world.   I play both games because I have no life at all. :)
