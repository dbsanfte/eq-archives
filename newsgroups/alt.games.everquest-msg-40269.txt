Now, that, I've done.  I was at a 7-11 and in walks a cop and walks straight
to the bakery section.  I said something about cops and donuts beig true and
he laughed and said it was an energy thing.  We talked for about 10 mins.
Seen him around town a few times since and he remembers me.  Hope it helps
if he pulls me over.
