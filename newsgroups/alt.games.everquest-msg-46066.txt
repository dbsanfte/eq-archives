About 90% of the time I go LD, I am able to get back in right away.
Verant could do something about that kind of LD, even if it *is* my
ISP/computer/region that is the problem.  Once you are in the game, EQ
uses UDP exclusively.  TCP is not used at all.

UDP is a datagram protocol ("User Datagram Protocol").  That means
each packet is completely independent, and there is no state
information as part of the protocol.  It is entirely up to the client
and the server to decide what it means to go LD.

Perhaps they need a parameter the user can set to control how long the
server and client put up with high packet loss before declaring LD.
It should be reasonably possible to not only get past many LDs this
way, it would not be too hard to make it so that you could keep an EQ
session up across an IP address change.  Those of us on dial-up or
ISDN would love that...we can get software that automatically redials
in the background if our connection goes away, but that changes our IP
address, and so even if the interruption is short (ISDN reconnects in
about 2 seconds), our EQ session is hosed.

In case anyone is curious, I believe Anarchy Online uses a TCP
connection, not a UDP connection, contrary to the conventional wisdom
for internet gaming, which says that you want the lower latency of
UDP, even though it means you have to deal with many error conditions
that TCP would have handled for you.

Dark Age of Camelot uses *both* a TCP connection and UDP.  My guess is
that they are using the TCP connection for things like mob data from
regions you are approaching, chat channels, and stuff like that, and
using UDP for movement and action data for the player and nearby mobs
and and players.
