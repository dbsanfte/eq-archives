I'm having a problem with the skin textures on a number of models.  So far
I've see it in Erudin, Toxxulia Forest, West and East Commonlands.

For example, in the East Common lands I saw a lion that had the skin texture
of a Freeport Militia Guard Uniform.  Guards in Erudin are faceless naked
golden skin automatons.

Is there any way to force the game to reload all the skin textures?
