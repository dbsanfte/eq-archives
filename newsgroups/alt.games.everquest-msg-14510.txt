Ahh, I see, so you went back and read the comments in the proprietary 
source code in order to make this determination?  And naturally, you 
expect that all members of Conquest were familiar with the intentions of 
the coders?

Allow me to rephrase the question:  Please explain how a player is to 
determine whether a feature of the world they encounter is a 'bug' or an 
'undocumented feature'.

I've heard several people say 'ask verant'.  I've tried that technique.  
The answer I've usually gotten amounts to 'You should know'.  Umm... how?
