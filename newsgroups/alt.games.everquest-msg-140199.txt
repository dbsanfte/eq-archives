That's the plan.  Participated in 4 Vox pickup raids over the last couple of
days, and while we didn't down her til the 4th one (obviously), she never
got off a cheal in any of them.  We had 2-4 chanters sieving constantly in
each attempt and it seemed to work.  The first 3 attempts failed mostly due
to the MA falling in about 30 seconds (not enough clerics and the ones we
had being feared due to low MR), but we got her down to less than 20 per
cent each time with no cheal.

My chanter wants one of them eyepatches, so he'll be at it again post-patch
;-).
