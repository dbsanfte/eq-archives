Riddle me this, Batman.  Why should I leave a hunting spot where my group
has been happily entrenched for hours because of another player?

Oh yeah.  I'm the Grinch Who Stole KEI.  Me.  All by myself.

Can you make an arguement without hurling insults?  Honestly.

Becasue I don't sit on my butt doing nothing.

Oh, I sit in my butt, alrighty, but I yuk in up in /gu.  Or I yuk it up with
my groupmates.  I take that time to enjoy the social aspects of the game.

And y'know what?  Whether you're chatting with your guildies or meeting new
folks, being soical makes the time fly.  I wish I had a plat for every time
I've looked down and said to the group, "Hey, guess what?  I'm full.  You
guys full?  I guess we can pull.".

Now, not every group is like that ... but I tend to excuse myself from
groups of power-gamers.  They're not my type.  I have enough stress in my
day-to-day life ... I don't need more stress from an activity I consider to
be a passtime.

I seek out groups of like-minded old farts like me, and we spend half our
time hunting and half finding out what we have in common.  Comparing what it
was like being a teenager in the 70s with someone else who did it in another
part of the country ...  or world ... is a ton of fun.  It hooked me from my
first day playing this game, and it still has me hooked.

You see, it's not about the gameplay so much.  I grew tired of the levelling
treadmill 2 years ago.  If it weren't for the other players, I'd have
cancelled my account a long, long time ago.

So, to answer your question .... sitting on your butt, as you put it, is
half the fun of the game to me.  If it never will be to you ... if you never
use the time to just send a random comment out to the zone in /ooc just to
see who bites ... then there's nothing I can do to convince you otherwise.
