It's been a major problem, and a major headache for the few in our guild 
that have the really needed skills, alchemists in particular.  It's also 
particularly bad for those tradeskills where you really have no way of 
advancing other than totally relying on two other types of tradeskillers.  
In my case, as a sage, I can basically make two things, patterns for 
armor, and spells.  For spells I need one each of an ink and paper.  The 
ink is made by an alchemist, the paper by a woodworker.  For patterns, I 
need thread (tailor) and paper (woodworker).  That is it, there is 
nothing else I can make.  So, either I have to spend huge sums of money 
on supplies to advance in tier 3+, only to have the items I make sit 
around not selling for long periods of time (this is even priced below 
everyone else selling them), or, I just bug friends to make me supplies, 
which they do, but, I am far from the only one needing the supplies they 
make.

My alt provisioner, on the other hand, needs noone else.  He just grinds 
away making food and drink, relying on noone else to make him anything at 
all.  If I were an alchemist, I could be making the tier 3 inks and 
washes, resins, oils, solvents and selling them off to make money.  As a 
sage, I am stuck either waiting on friends or dumping way too much money 
onto alchemists and woodworkers in order to make anything at all.
