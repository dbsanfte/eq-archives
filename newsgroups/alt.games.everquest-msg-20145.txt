Definition problem. Are you talking about the general group of games, 
that feature you having a 'character' with stats & skills etc which
can be developed or are you talking about acting out some invented
personality? The former are still called RPG's, RolePlayingGames,
which is a bit infortunate. The latter is indeed called roleplaying.
That's two different things. Or do you think most people in 'Strategy games'
like Total Annihilation put much strategy into their play?
