VI is still designing quests (as they must, sadly) based on characters
actually getting things for themselves in the game. When you say that
"at 45+ most people have much better." it's a true statement. But most
all of them have "much better" which they could NEVER have actually gone
out and gotten on their own or with a group of like leveled friends.
They are either twinks, or they saved up a buttload of money somehow and
bought stuff above their level from higher level players looking to
unload it.

The twinkage factor is all you are seeing. It's all good.  But the
majority of quests are going to give a reward appropriate to what a
group of untwinked characters could get.

Try to think what level you were before you could start killing mobs
that dropped fine steel weapons. IIRC, the lowest level mobs in the old
world that do that were the likes of the Tech Mas Gnolls and the Hermit
in SK.  You needed to be up into your twenties to fight them.

Do you know anybody today who would even want to start a level *one*
character with FS weapons? Say nothing of use them for 20 levels? Well,
quests work the same way. If it's a quest you can barely complete at
level 25, you'll probably get something on par with fine steel weapons,
or armor on par with gnoll hide tunics and such.

The game was designed with a concept in mind of you using rusty weapons
and hand tailored tattered leather armor for your first ten or more
levels. Of course, even on a brand spanking new, non-movelog server,
that lasts for about two days tops.
