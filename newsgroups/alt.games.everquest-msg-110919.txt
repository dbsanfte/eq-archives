Because everyone in GD is 30 to 35 and doesn't want a level 43 sucking up
all their xps.  Or at least thats the way it seemed that night.  And I *did*
find a pickup group.  They just sucked.  I'm still not sure if I should have
spoken up when things were obviously(?) going stupid.  On the one hand I was
right that we were getting in over our heads, but on the other hand how am I
supposed to know how much a bunch of level 50's can handle?  But I guess I
learned a little about that so it's all good as they say.  At least *I*
didn't die, and I got a good laugh.  We ran to the zoneline dragging his
corpse and me screaming "train" "to wll" (sp).
