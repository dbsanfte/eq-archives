I dunno.  From m-w.com:

Main Entry: 1whine
Pronunciation: 'hwIn, 'wIn
Function: verb
Inflected Form(s): whined; whin�ing
1a : to utter a high-pitched plaintive or distressed cry
 b : to make a sound similar to such a cry <the wind whined in the chimney>
2 : to complain with or as if with a whine
3 : to move or proceed with the sound of a whine <the bullet whined... across 
    the ice -- Berton Rouech�>
transitive senses : to utter or express with or as if with a whine

You do seem to show signs of distress about this issue, and it is, in fact, a 
complaint that you wish to discuss.  Whether or not your distressed complaint 
is 'high-pitched' would be the only remaining issue.  I'd say, on USENET, 
having more than 5 or 6 long posts on a particular complaint within a day or 
so is pretty high pitched.
