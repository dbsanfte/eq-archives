Hello everyone-

I have a few questions if you all could advise me ...Please.

Looking through EQ directory i found a file (like a player file) that reads
mpc_warrior_01    ......  I dont ever remember creating a warrior and have
no idea what this is....?   Any thoughts?

Recently upgraded to a p4 1.8 processor have 512 ram and radeon 64 vid card
..  c: 20 gig    d: 80 gig and  and E: 20 gig(and has eq directory in it
(over half ,  if not more of hd's have free space)

There is 2 accounts on this computer mine and my spouse.
When i log onto my main charcter i seem to hang on the splash screen
awaiting entry into the world....like every other time..
i have like 3 characters 40, 10, 5  .... it only seems to happen with my
level 40....???
never happens (so i am told) with any charcter on the other account...
.......I then have to reboot and am gettin sick of it :)

also i have a dsl connection ..

Sometimes when am playing i get a badddd lag and go link dead .....
chat box goes blurry and anything i type comes up about 2 minutes
hence.....occasionaly when i reboot after this i have lost alll of my macros
and screen setting.....again very much aggrivating...

Any and all help or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

I have reinstalled eq and all xpansions about 1month ago...After my original
luclin install

again thank you


    -kris.
