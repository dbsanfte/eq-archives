Bullshit.  The reason that "grief" play in the P&P environment is
not a problem as it is in MMO games is that when it's purely an RP
thing the characters can exact revenge (i.e. RP begets RP), and
when the player is an ass the other players can deal with the
offender by expelling him/her from the group.  The latter option
is not unavailable in an MMO game, even if the dickhead is banned
he/she can simply get another account.

That has to do entirely with the "massively multi-player" feature
of the game, as noted above.  It is MMO, with its unavoidable
interaction with anonymous strangers, that requires a certain
minimum of "integrity" as the basis for RP.

Golly, amazing how that works, ain't it?

And you have no trouble at all insisting that thousands of others
should be required to abide by your "vision", simply because it is
yours.
