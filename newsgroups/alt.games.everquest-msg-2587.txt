}> Oh, and it doesn't happen on my laptop, which is a P3-700, 128 MB RAM,
}> crappy ATI video, crappy SB emulation sound.

So... as I mentioned in here a couple times, my laptop got stolen.  So I 
may be in the market for a new one (assuming the insurance thingy works 
out, which isn't looking too good just now. :( ) So anyway, I wanted to 
know what laptops people have gotten EQ to work on, and what ones they 
haven't.  

My old laptop, oddly enough, was a Sony Vaio.  It's in some way  very 
amusing to me that EQ wouldn't even try to run on it. :)  

I get the impression the biggest litmus test for working is whether or not 
the laptop has any sort of a 3D graphics chip.  Are there any laptop 3D 
graphics chips that are known not to work, or have especially hard 
problems, outside of the recent patching problems?  

I'm considering a Dell Inspiron 3800, because I'm not rich.  Anyone tried 
that one?  I haven't really looked at Toshibas yet, though, is there a 
reason to choose one of those instead?
