Ok, I did my best on this, though I'll allow that the level of my best might
have dropped as I worked on this.  If you can think of things you would like me
to add, remove, or change, please respond to this message.  I have cleared out
my Killfile, so if you did land on it in the past, you are not there now so I
can read your input on this.  I am in particular need of known, valid serverwide
chat channels to add to this list.

Please read the FAQ.  The FAQ ideally will keep you from introducing 
yourself with an annoying question.  Questions should be posted only 
when the FAQ, game manuals, or related web sites do not contain the 
information you need or are unclear.
Read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in the EverQuest program 
directory/folder on your computer. Special note all versions of EQ have 
a 'printable' copy of the eqmanual_supplement.doc. But still there's 
lots of good information in it.


New/Updated Material:
Updated Newsgroup Posting Title to always be: "FAQ xx/xx/xx" with the x's being
replaced by the numbers of the current date. This
FAQ will be posted once month unless there is a large change that has 
occurred.

-----------------------------------------
1.    General questions

1.1   Q: What is the FAQ for?

A: This FAQ is designed for a newcomer to the game and/or this 
newsgroup.  It attempts to answer some basic questions about the game, but owing
to 
the complexity and depth of Everquest, it is not possible to answer all 
queries.  If you have a question that requires some more specific detail 
there is a list of URL's at the end of this document that you might like to
visit.

1.2    I see something in the FAQ that I think is wrong.  What should I do?

A:  The currant keeper of the FAQ is Annie Benson-Lennaman.  Her main is Teapray
on Firiona Vie, and she is often is the chat channel serverwide.age:age.  If you
see a mistake, flame her within an inch of her miserable lif... I mean, please
let me know what is wrong and why, and I will update the FAQ if I agree.  The
easiest way to do this is to simply respond to a thread where the FAQ is posted,
and state your case.  If I happen to miss your suggestion (as may happen, I
don't always read every post in the group) then keep at it, or contact me in
game.  Note, if I feel that I am being harassed unduly, I will not hesitate to
use my ignore list/kill filter.

1.3    Q: What is the newsgroup for?

A: For the discussion of all things related to the game of Everquest.


2.    Questions about Everquest

2.3    Q: What are these expansions I keep hearing about?

A: There have been seven expansion packs to EverQuest so far: Ruins of Kunark,
Scars of Velious, Shadows of Luclin, Planes of Power, Legends of Ykesha, Lost
Dungeons of Norrath, and Gates of Discord.

2.4    Q: What is the Ruins of Kunark?

A: Commonly called Kunark, The Ruins of Kunark was the first EverQuest expansion
to be released.   
This expansion included a new continent with many new zones to adventure 
in, lots of new dungeons, items, mobs, quests and spells, and also 
included a new playable race of characters, the Iksar lizard-men.  
People with this expansion also were allowed to advance beyond level 50 
(up to level 60,) which was previously impossible.

2.5    Q: What is the Scars of Velious?

A:  Commonly called Velious, The Scars of Velious is an expansion similar to the
Ruins of Kunark, 
including another new continent with new zones, dungeons, items, mobs, 
quests, spells, level 60 cap, etc. but it is geared towards higher level 
players (level 30+) and does not include a new playable race.  

2.6   Q: What is the Shadows of Luclin?

A:   Commonly called SoL, this expansion adds Nexus spires to somewhat
facilitate transportation, The Bazaar, a 
place to trade items with other players, and new, more detailed player 
models.  Also added more hunting areas for all levels, four city zones, 
the beastlord class, and a new playable race, the Vah Shir. 

2.7    Q: What is Planes of Power?

A:  Commonly called PoP, this expansion raises the level cap to 65, greatly
expands the Alternate Advancement 
options available, adds ability to form raids of up to 72 people, and adds 
a very efficient transportation system, with direct teleportation to most 
major cities.  Provides additional hunting grounds for levels 46 and up.

2.8    Q: What is Legends of Ykesha?

A:  Commonly called LoY, this expansion adds expanded bank space, in-game maps,
armor dyes for all slots that show a graphic, the story window, a log journal,
Frogloks as a playable race, and a few new hunting zones for level 40 and up.

2.9    Q: What is the Lost Dungeons of Norrath?

A:  Commonly called LDoN, this expansion provides instanced dungeons.  An
instanced dungeons can only be accessed by the group that activated it.  To
active a dungeon, a group must have at least 3 members, and the range of levels
within the group must be 7 levels.  For example, a group that had a 20th level
member and a 27th level member could get a dungeon, but they could not add
anyone who was 19 or under or 28 or over.  The dungeons have missions that must
be completed within 90 minutes, or 120 minutes for a lesser prize.  A win will
result in each member being granted a number of Adventure Points that can be
spent in the Wayfarer camps.  Also, the LDoN dungeon drop Augmentations, which
can be used to add stats or abilities to armor and weapons.  

2.10    Q: What is Gates of Discord?

A: Commonly called GoD, this expansion adds a large tradeskill orientated
boat/city zone, a tribute system where one can trade plat or items for buffs
from NPC in the player's home city, as well as normal and instanced zones that
intended for players who are leveled 50+.

2.11    What is EQ Macros and where can I get it?

A: EQMacros is a program which is no longer available. The purpose of 
this program was to provide a means whereby users could circumvent some 
of the more tedious aspects of the game. It also dispensed with some of 
the disadvantages certain characters had, such as night blindness.
Verant has required that the author of EQMacros cease distribution, and 
has stated that anyone caught using it will have their account banned.
This is a controversial subject in this newsgroup, and has been argued 
to death. Posting questions on this subject is generally frowned upon. 
Further information can be found at www.xylobot.com

2.12   Where are the Everquest servers located?

A: The entire EverQuest universe (at present, 50 separate worlds) 
is run on approximately 1,000 servers. These are located in an onsite 
datacenter and at AT&T CERFnet (in San Diego).  The Antonius 
Bayle server is located in the UK.  Kane Bayle, Venril Sathir, Kael Drakkel,
Sebilis servers are located in Europe.

2.13   What are the special servers all about?

A:  The special servers include Everquest Legends, Test, the Zeks, and Firiona
Vie.  These servers have different ruleset or conditions that change the gaming
experience to varying degrees from the regular servers.  In general, all the
special servers have lower server populations.  Except for Legends, they all
cost the same to play on as the regular servers.  

2.13a  What is Everquest Legends?

A: Everquest Legends refers to the Stormhammer server a premium service server
which costs $40.00 US a month to play on.  Some of the features of this server
include Character Pages, which are personal homepages featuring all the
character's statistics and items. Also included is a personal journal, Legendary
Items, Interactive Maps, Guild Halls: a website for Guild's needs including a
guild calendar, message board, member roster, and pages to post guild news, the
guild history, and increased dynamic content and customer service driven by a
great presence of GM and support staff.

2.13b  What is Test Server?

A: This server is designed to be a place where the developers can see how new
changes to the game will work when regular players interact with them.  Test
players often get to see new developments to EQ before people on production
servers do (if the changes get implemented at all).  They also play on the most
unstable server available.  Test server frequently is taken off line, with and
without warning, and small rollbacks where minutes or hours of gameplay can be
set back.  Also there is a chance that SOE might elect to do a total character
or equipment wipe.  There has never been a character wipe to date, and there was
one total equipment wipe.  To access Test server you must go into your Everquest
folder and run the application TestEverQuest.


2.13c  What are the Zek Servers?

A: These are the servers in which all players are subject to Player versus
Player (PvP) gameplay as well as the Player versus Environment gameplay.  The
server names are Sullon Zek, Rallos Zek, Tallon Zek, and Vallon Zek.  Many
people love the PvP experience, while others hate it and consider the
inhabitants of the Zeks to be among the worst of griefers that EQ has to offer. 
While it is up to the new player to decide their feelings on this matter, many
would consider it a good idea for true new EQ players to get a handle on the PvE
aspects of the game before also having to deal with the added challenges that
PvP presents. 

2.13d  What is Firiona Vie Server?

A: Firiona Vie a roleplaying preferred server.  This server has several special
rules including only one character per account (if you see people who say they
have more than on character on this server this means they have more than one
account), Trivial Loot Code (TLC) where if a MoB is green to anyone in the party
that killed it then any loot tagged Lore or Magic will disappear (poof), a lack
of No Drop items that extents to nearly everything in game save for certain high
end keys, Grandmaster Trophies (but not all of them) and Epic and Epic drops,
and a lack of Common Tongue (each race starts with their own racial language,
and Common is replaced with Human).  The old rules about alignment grouping
restrictions and language learning have been lifted.  SOE doesn't enforce any
roleplaying rules, though several members of the server do with varying degrees
of commitment.

2.14    Systems Questions

2.14a   How can I increase my frame rate?
Add this to your EQCLIENT.INI under the default section:
UseUmbra=True
UseTnL=False
VideoModeBitsPerPixel=16

Note: This may not help all systems. Use at your own discretion.



3.    Questions about gameplay


3.1    Q: What is the best race/class combo to play

A: To answer this question you have to ask yourself what is important to 
you. If you're familiar with other RPGs and games of this nature, you 
probably know that each character will have his or her strengths and 
weaknesses, and that no single class/race combo will give you all the 
good with none of the bad.  The question to ask is not what is the best 
race/class combo is the best, but to ask which is best for YOU.  The 
best way to answer this question is to learn about all of the classes 
and races, and make your decision based on that knowledge.

3.2    Q: Is there any way for me to change the deity I worship, or to 
become Agnostic?

A: No, sorry.  The only way you can "change" your deity is to delete 
your character and start over.

3.3   Q: What are the Priest of Discord for?/Can I become a PK on regular
servers?

A:  The Priests of Discord (PoD) will hand out a Tome of Discord if you talk to
them and follow their prompts.  If you return the Tome to them, you will become
a Player Killer and your name will now show in red.   Becoming a player killer
has grave consequences that you may not be 
completely understanding of by reading the tome.  A player killer can 
engage in combat with other player killers, but cannot kill or be killed by
non-player 
killers (with the exception of in a duel.) Also, and more importantly, 
if you are a player killer, you will NOT be able to receive most forms 
of aid from other players, nor will you be able to aid them.  This means 
that you cannot be healed or "buffed" by anybody who is not a player 
killer.  Since more than 99% of the players on normal servers are not 
player killers this totally ruins your ability to get in a group beyond 
level 15 or so.  If you want to be a player killer, play on a PvP 
server.  If you do turn in a Tome and change your mind, there is no guarantee
that you will be able to change back to normal status, so only do it if you are
certain that you want your character to live a solitary life.

3.4    Q: I want to transfer one character from one EverQuest account I 
have to another.  Can I do this, and if so, how?

A: Yes, you can, but it will cost you.   Full details can be found at
https://store.station.sony.com/eq_char_moves/index.jsp

3.5    Q: How do I alt+tab out of EverQuest and return to the game?  It 
would really be helpful if I could use Notepad or the web while I'm 
playing?

A: SOE has enabled windowed mode in EQ.  To activate it, hit alt+enter.  Then
hit alt+shift+R to release the mouse.  Once that is done, you can minimize the
window that EQ is on, and run other tasks, surf the web, or even open another
instance of EQ if your machine can handle that and you have another account on
which to play.  Note, this ability to break out of EQ and stay in the game seems
somewhat glitchy, and doesn't work well for all users and can be broken after
major patches.

3.6    Q: What is a hotkey?

A: A key that is customized to perform an in-game function

3.7    Q: How do I make a hotkey?

A: Refer to the in game help section, which can be found by clicking on the
question mark on the Window Selector.  

3.8    Q: How do I make a spell a hotkey?

A: Right-click and hold down the button over the spell that you want to hot key
until that spell icon appears on your cursor.  Then drag that icon to your
hotkey bank, and right click again to drop into the slot that you want in in.  

3.9    Q: What is a social?

A: Making a social allows you to execute line commands and say 
predefined phrases with a single keystroke.

3.10    Q: How do I make a social?

A: On the main screen, press the Socials button.  Several buttons will 
appear with pre-made social key commands.  You can edit a hotkey by 
right-clicking it.  To edit a line of a social, just click it and start 
typing.  You can edit the name of the social in the same manner.
When you finish, you can make your social into a hotkey.  When you 
activate the social, it will execute whatever you typed in on the lines 
of the social key.  For example, you can make a social that looks like 
this:
/afk
/groupsay I'm going away from keyboard for a sec, guys.
And if you activated this social key, it would flag you AFK, and you'd 
tell your group "I'm going away from keyboard for a second, guys."
Any "line command" (command that starts with a slash) can be used in a 
social.  There are even a few commands that are specifically intended 
for use in socials.  For more information on these commands and others, 
read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in your EverQuest directory.

3.11    Q: How do I change the colors of the text?

A: To do this ingame, go to the Options section of your Window selector, or type
Alt-O, then open up the colors section to the far right.  Click on the button of
the text type you'd like to change, then adjust the color to your liking.

3.12    Q: Where can I get an up-to-date list of commands and/or emotes?

A:  Type /help to get a list of games commands.  You can also try the
eqmanual_supplement.doc file in your EverQuest directory. 
Also, if you visit http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ and scroll down for 
the links to "Commands..." you will find 3 selections, "Emotes...", 
"Game Commands...", and "Chat Terms...".

3.13    Q: What are all these abbreviations and acronyms?  What does it 
all mean?

A: Here is an excellent glossary that can help you with this baffling matter.
http://web.archive.org/web/20030604092025/http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm

If that wraps try http://tinyurl.com/2qnmb

3.14   Q: Where should I hunt at my particular level/class/race?

A: The following sites have good charts on this.
http://www.eqatlas.com/huntguidelevel.html
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/zones/Level_Chart.html

3.15   Q: How can I make some money to buy spells and armor and stuff?

A: Kill things, loot them, sell the proceeds, repeat.  If you are a level one
newbie then you might want to check out the Qeynos newbie yard.  Kill snakes and
rats, they have drops that can sell for 2 gold or more rarely 2 plat if you
happen to find a Plague rat tail.  Once you out grow this little gold mine of a
spot the best you can probably do is to find items to sell to other players in
the bazaar.  Spiderling silks, spider silks, bone chips and various pelts can
all be sold to player for considerably more than merchants will play for them. 
Check the prices these are going for in the bazaar and you might be pleasantly
surprised.

3.15a  Q: That's taking too long!  How about I just beg some money?

A: Sure, there are tons of fabulously wealthy people walking past you.  And if
you beg from them, there is a fairly good chance that some of them might give
you something.  But DON'T do this.  People tend to get angry at beggars, and
they are considered by many to be the lowest form of life in the EQ universe. 
You will damage your reputation, end up on ignore lists, and stand a good chance
of being insulted with varying degrees of venom.  
   Also, if someone is trying to beg from you, feel free to ignore them.  Not
giving them money does not mean that you aren't a nice person, anymore than not
making an effort to feed cockroaches makes you an animal hater.

3.15b   Q: Well, how about just buying plat then?

A: You've seen the banners and advertisements at various EQ sites, and it does
seem to be a quick way to get the plat/item you're lacking?  Should you do it? 
Well, there are a few different schools of thought on this matter.
  First is hell yes, we need your business and all your friends are doing it and
you can't play without it and give us your freaking credit card number already!
 Second is more laid back.  Some people think that buying plat and equipment is
a personal decision, and if someone has enough real life money to spend it this
way then no harm done.
 Third is probably the most common, or at least has the most vocal people in
it.  They feel that EQ plat buyers/sellers are doing a Very Bad Thing, and they
have several reasons for this that many find to be compelling.  
 1) It is against the End User License Agreement (EULA).  You know, that thing
you click past every time you play EQ.  When you do that, you are in effect
agreeing to what is written there.  One of the things it says is that you won't
do this.  You're not a scummy liar, are you?
 2) That plat and those items are farmed, and farmers hurt the honest folk who
are trying to play the game.  Are you trying to earn your very own Shiny Do-Dad
of Awesome Wowzer, but some guy named Eqpharmer always seems to be at the camp
where the  Enraged Snow Pea that drops it spawns?  You pay the same money to
play EQ that he does, you should have a chance to earn the item same as he,
instead of being shut out because he has to sell it support his on-line porn
habit.  Same thing for good money camps.
 3) People that buy their equipment/plat/characters are not really learning how
to play the game, and thus are more likely to hurt the poor saps that have the
misfortune of being in the same zone as them when they blunder through causing
trains and mayhem.
   Soooo.... should you do it?  That is up to you, of course.  Just know that if
you do, a fairly good chunk of your fellow EQ players will think less of you
because of it.

3.16    Q: Why can mobs hit through walls?

A: I was happily trading inside a vendor's shop, when suddenly I died 
seeing 'A Griffon hits you for 300dmg... loading, please wait...' - 
WTF...
Computer AI controls mobs and other NPCs in EQ, which is no substitute 
for a <supposedly> intelligent human being controlling an avatar. 
Monsters all behave according to strict rules on pathing, aggro-range 
etc., and don't really employ sophisticated tactics and strategy in the 
same way a human player would. To avoid unbalancing the game, Verant 
have opted to give mobs an 'unfair' advantage - they can hit through 
walls, they ignore the z-axis of 3D space to hit from a long way above 
or below a player, and generally have the ability to hit back from 
seemingly unreachable locations. This is to avoid exploits like getting 
easy experience by raining down spells or arrows on a mob from a 
location, which that mob (because of it's programmed pathing) cannot 
reach. Pet using classes may gain some satisfaction from the knowledge 
that their pets have the same unfair advantages as other mobs, and can 
hit back at that pesky monster whacking you from under the ground...

3.17    Q: Hey, I can't even play at all!  The servers are down!  What gives?

A: SOE is ripping you off, the sons of bitches.  Well, that's the sarcastic
answer.  Actually, Everquest is an evolving game, and it requires periodic
maintenance known as patches.  Patch time is also when various changes to
gameplay, some good, some other, are made.  SOE does not promise that you'll be
able to play 24/7/365.  SOE will no compensate you the 40 cents per day or
whatever it is for the time you could not play.  Also, SOE will bring down the
servers with little or no notice if they learn of a bug or exploit that they
consider to be major.  You can check on scheduled downtime by going to
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/scheduled_downtime.jsp .

3.18    Q: Why did I get chewed out for inspecting someone?

A: Many people feel that it is very rude to inspect someone without asking
first, akin to walking up to a woman and pulling down her pants to read the
label on her underwear.  Others feel it no big deal, and people who make a big
deal out of it need counseling, or a long flame session, or something equally
useful.  Regardless of how you feel about the matter, if you want to do your
best to get along with your fellow EQ players, it is best to simply ask before
you inspect.

3.19   Q: How can I send a message to my friend on another server?

A: ;tell servername.friendname message. For example, to send your friend Giggals
on the Karana server while you are playing on The Seventh Hammer you would
simply type ;tell karana.giggals Tag! You're it!  You do not need to include a
forward slash / when you do this.

3.20   Q: Can I ignore someone on another server?

A: You betcha.  If it turns out that Giggals simply hates tag and is now
threatening to kill you, over and over again, type /ignore karana.giggals . 
This also can be useful for people who are being pests in any serverwide
channels you might be in.

4      Everquest II

4.1     Q: What is this Everquest II game that I hear about?

A: Everquest II is another MMORPG that is under development by SOE and is
thought to be released later this year.  The time of release keeps getting
pushed back.  It is set in the world of Norrath, several hundred years in the
future after the planet has suffered some major cataclysm that destroys much of
the known world.

4.2     Q: Does this mean that the Everquest I am playing will end then?

A:  Everquest II is not meant to be a replacement for Everquest Live.  Both
games have different development teams, and SOE steadily maintains that it means
to maintain both games for as long as there is enough of a demand to keep them
both going.  Everquest is currently a very popular title, and it has managed to
maintain this despite challenges from other MMORPG's that people have sworn
would mean its decline.  That said, few things in life are guaranteed, and if EQ
drops in popularity for whatever reason to the point that is no longer
profitable, it is unrealistic to expect that SOE will continue it.  Still, the
day when they do pull the plug on Everquest Live seems to be remote at this
time. 

4.3     Q: How can I find out more about Everquest II? 

A:  There is a section in the links portion at the bottom of this document that
will lead you to EQII websites. 



5.    Getting along with people in alt.games.everquest

5.1     Q: I posted one little innocent question, and got flamed.  Why?

A: alt.games.everquest has an established community, and several of the long
time residents have strong personalities.  We also have a steady influx of new
users here, many of who make no effort at all to do any research at all before
they ask questions.  This combination seems to bring out the flame-throwers on a
regular basis.  Also, we also have several here who enjoy a long, repetitious,
self imploding discussions laced with personal attacks and explicatives.  If you
do find yourself getting flamed, probably the best step to take would be to just
shrug it off, and not reply in kind.  It is very useful to have a thick skin in
AGE, and a little common sense isn't a bad idea either.

5.2     Q: So does that mean that I can't ask any questions here at all?

A: Not at all.  There are many people here who are very knowledgeable about EQ
and are happy to share what they know.  It would be helpful if you were to some
basic research before you ask questions that may have been asked many times
before.  One thing you might try is going to
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=alt.games.everquest&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search  
or if it wraps http://tinyurl.com/26o6r , check the "Search only in
alt.games.everquest" radio button, and then type in some keywords from your
question.  But if that doesn't help, by all means fire away.  If you get flamed
for it, refer to question 4.1 of this FAQ.

5.3    Q: What is top posting, and why is it so hated here?

A: Top posting is the act of posting your reply on top of quoted material,
rather than placing your response at the bottom of quoted material or
interspersed throughout it.  AGE is a newsgroup that on the whole feels strongly
about top posting, and the feelings are not warm and fuzzy.  The topics of
discussion in AGE are often complex and wandering, and having to scroll to the
bottom of a post to see what the heck a person is replying to is awkward and
annoying, and breaks the flow of the post.  You might prefer top posting and
that is your prerogative, but if you insist on using it here prepared to be
flamed and to land on alot of Kill Files.  And please don't try to skirt the
issue by just not quoting anything at all, either.  People are not going to go
back through the thread playing detective to try to figure out what the heck
you're responding to.  

5.4   Q: I've noticed alot of unfriendly posts coming from the same people over
and over.  This newsgroup sure has it's share of jerks, eh?

A: It would be hard to find an active newsgroup that doesn't.  However, many of
the more virulent posters we have are basically right in what they say, once you
look past the rudeness of manner of their presentation.  They may be
enthusiastic in going after people who post facts or opinions that they
dispute.  But if you can get past that, you might find that they can teach alot
about EQ.  If you can't get past it, no worries.  Just ignore them or place them
in your Kill File.  Endless arguing with them will not generally make anyone
think you are especially clever, or put them in their place, or do whatever it
is you are hoping to do.  Also, if you makes some clever misspelling of a
regular's posting name in an effort to win an argument, you automatically lose
that argument.  /nod

5.5   Q: Will everyone hate me if I make an off topic comment or post?

A: No, not everyone.  Practically every active newsgroup out there experiences
some degree of topic drift, this is just the nature of the beast.  AGE is a
fairly active group, and the drift is quite noticeable at times.  If this annoys
you then it it best to just start ignoring a thread when it goes from talking
about the best offhand weapon for a halfing ranger to the best way to make
nachos. Something to keep in mind is that you have about a good a chance of
stopping topic drift as you do of stopping continental drift.  If you are going
to start a new thread that is clearly not related to EQ, it is a good idea to
start it with the letter OT (off topic) so that those who want to can avoid it
from the start.

   Newsgroup Etiquette.

The following is a list of WebSites for viewing common etiquette
techniques for newsgroups.
Quoting Style in Newsgroup Postings:
http://www.xs4all.nl/~wijnands/nnq/nquote.html
General Net Etiquette:
http://www.templetons.com/brad/emily.html

Here is a generic Netiquette guide.  You can take most of what is here to almost
any newsgroup you go to.


o	Newsgroups are like self-governing communities; there are no 
"Newsgroup Cops." Instead, posters regulate themselves. Below are some 
simple rules of newsgroup etiquette to understand before you venture 
into a newsgroup.  Think of newsgroup etiquette as a set of guidelines 
that will keep you from making mistakes and make you look and sound like 
a veteran newsgroup poster.
o	This is a non binary newsgroup, please do not post binaries.
o	Do not post in HTML
o	Lurk. Read the newsgroup without posting for a few weeks. This is 
known as "lurking," and it will give you the flavor of the newsgroup.
o	Read the FAQ. Find and read the newsgroup's FAQ, or list of 
Frequently
Asked Questions and other important and useful information. It can 
answer questions you didn't even know you had, and it's the quickest way 
to learn a newsgroup.
o	Stay on-topic. Know what's on-topic and what's off-limits. Every 
newsgroup is a little different in what it talks about, and how it does 
the talking.
o	DON'T SHOUT. TYPING IN ALL CAPS IS CONSIDERED SHOUTING. It's 
easier to read a mix of upper- and lower-case letters.
o	Never, ever post "MAKE MONEY FAST." It doesn't work, it gets 
people really mad, and no matter what it says, it's probably illegal.
o	Everyone hates commercials. Be very hesitant about posting [ed. Hesitant
hell.  Don't do it!]
advertisements or commercial messages. This also gets people really mad.
o	Ignore "trolls." Some people get a thrill from posting "flames" 
(really obnoxious messages) just to get a rise out of people. Sad, isn't 
it?
o	Don't "spam." Spam is posting the same message to dozens, even 
hundreds or thousands of unrelated newsgroups. No matter how important 
you think your message may be, it's not worth it. Think about it - if 
everyone posted about every topic, no one would be able to find 
anything.
o	Be Original. Don't over quote: Copying a long post (more than 20 
lines) just to add "I agree" or "me too" is considered bad form. Make 
clear who and what you are replying to.

o	The Golden Rule: Do unto others, as you would have them do unto 
you.
Remember, every expert was a newbie once.

6. Chat Channels

6.1    Q: What are chat channels?

A: Chat channels are basically chat room like entities that everyone on your
server can access.  There are also established chat channels that joined by
everyone on every server of EQ, if they so desired.

6.2    Q: How do I join/start a chat channel?

A: Type /join channelname. For example, if you wanted to join the market channel
on your server, you would type /join market (most servers do have a market
channel of some sort, though they might be named something else like auction,
bazaar, or whatever.  If you want to find out, ask around or experiment).  If
you want to join a channel that has a password, type /join channel:password . 
For example, to join a market channel with the password of shop, you would type
/join market:shop .  If you want to create a channel, simply type the name of
channel you want to create, and a password if you think it should have one.  If
you want to join a channel on another server, you would type /join
servername.channelname:password.  For example, if you wanted to join the market
on the Drinal server, you would type /join drinal.market.  In all cases, the
number to the right of the channel name you have joined tells you how many
people are in that channel at that time.

6.3    Q: How do I leave a channel I have joined?

A: Type /leave Channel#.  For example, if you have only joined the drinal market
channel, then it will be channel 1.  To leave it, you would type /leave 1 .

6.4    Q: How do I autojoin a channel?

A: If you know that you want to be in a chat channel every time you are online,
type /autojoin channelname: password.  If you want to autojoin more than one
channel, then type it like this /autojoin channelname:password,
nextchannel:nextpassword, and so on.  For example, to join both the market
channel and the serverwide alt.games.everquest chat channels you would type
/autojoin market, serverwide.age:age

6.5    Q: How do I un-autojoin a channel?

A: You have to type the autojoin channel again, leaving out the channels you
don't want to be in anymore.  If you don't want to be in any channels, you can
either type "/autojoin  , " or you can go into your .ini file and edit out the
autojoin list as it is shown there.

6.6    A few current serverwide channels.

serverwide.age:age -- the chat channel for this newsgroup.

Others to follow as they are discovered.

For player equipment prices:

The following site does have a list of prices for various items, but the
information it gives is suspect for a few reasons.  For one, the going price on
any particular item can vary to a great deal from server to server.  Also,
prices often rise or fall over time given to inflation, deflation, and newer,
better items becoming more common.  Another problem with this site is that the
prices are given by the player base, many of whom may have had the item they
were pricing for sell at the time they reported the price, making them a biased
source of information.
