Uhm...guards in GFay do not like the mobile trees, which are evil. But they
don't kill them for you unless you are ally, maybe not even then, haven't
tried to find out.

You might have tried the simple and easy to use /y (yell for help) command,
to indicate that you were not kiting the mob, but indeed in real trouble. I
see that one shouted or ooc'ed at least once every five minutes because some
moron has just shouted to the whole zone for help, on the rare occasion that
I go back to that godawful zone.
