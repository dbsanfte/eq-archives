    How many healers are there, and how many damage dealers are there for a
given fight? Usually the healer:damage dealer ratio is 1:3 or less, counting
any priest class as a healer. The amount of damage done by the raid as a
whole if you support a healer and keep the damage dealers alive longer is
usually going to be more than the amount of damage done if you deal damage
and the raid as a whole dies earlier.

    That being said, it's a cruddy job. I much prefer necromancer mana
transfer to be done via Mind Wrack, where it's a steady per tick amount and
the necromancer is left free to do whatever else they desire as long as
Wrack is kept up.
