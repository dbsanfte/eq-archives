I'm just a noob that's been playing for three days, but this just happened
to me while fighting a worker scarab.  I whacked on him until he had 2%
health left and he turned to flee.  After two steps he disappeared into the
terrain.  Still targeted I waited for him to emerge but he never did.
Wasn't worth spending too much time on, but it still ticked me off.  Hope
it's not a rampant bug.
