I am having the same problem.  My video card is an ATI Xpert 128/16mb.  For
some reason I'm having problems with the sound as well.  The weird thing is
that upon loading the game for the first time after install, the music
played fine.  Then the video started flickering and went dark on me.

The drivers I've using are the 4.13.7202 (haven't seen any higher anywhere),
and I have DirectX 8.1 installed.  I ran the dxdiag program and everything
tested satisfactorily.

TIA!
