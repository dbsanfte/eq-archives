Well, in the end it all comes down to opinion.  However, you seem to take
offense when I called you rude for following that line of thinking.  "In
what way am I rude?"  If it is your opinion that an uninvited inspection is
behaving in a disrespectful manner and expect someone have respect for that
opinion, then also please respect the opinion of Bizbee and I believing YOU
to be the one that is rude, disrespectful and petty.  Obviously, reasoning
with you is impossible so I am going to be dropping this now.  If you think
that is disrespectful behavior, I think it would be safe to say that I am
afraid of what other stupid and idiotic things you find rude in real life
and glad I will most likely never find out. ;)  This should end it. :P
