Zone in to OT, click DE mask, and wave to the nice friendly 'goons as I zoom
past (using selos just because the run to Skyfire is long, not out of fear)  If
I was hunting there I'd have kept DE illusion up all the time so as to avoid
training 'goons in even if I was on selos.  DE lasts a looooong time.

But I do recall a couple raids getting Mage epic drops using a bard puller to
get the 'goons clear.  Haven't done it myself, but it would be another instance
of "bard speed needed if you want to do it this way"
