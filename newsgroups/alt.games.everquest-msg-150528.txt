There is nothing wrong with making a Bard for there first character but it
must be researched. The only character that doesn't need to be researched is
a Warrior all he has to do is Hit, Taunt, Kick, and hope his healer knows
what he or she is doing. Sorry not trying to degrade warriors I personally
think they are a fun class to play. Bards take a lot of dexterity, timing,
alertness, and savvy you can not play a Bard and take breaks or watch TV
while play. Your Spell book and your Hot keys need to be organized more so
then any other class because you are constantly switching songs instruments
and weapons as the situation calls for.
