Will reply to your text later, but reading this amused me :)

Was a brief summing up of me and some other people in a flame thread (in a
totally unrelated thread)

"Ok, I won't comment directly on this issue (because I honestly can't read
half of what is in this post!), but I will tell you what I know about these
people."

Xolerus - I met Xolerus in sebilis one day. <snip>

Aquiles - I've had a couple opportunities to group with him in CT<snip>

Turtuclow - I dunno man... this just doesn't look too good for you. I see 3
people, all of which know you IRL saying that you're <snip>

Meemers - The only thing I remember about Meemers in PoV is him getting VERY
pissed about getting trained several times near the castle (and for good
reason...my grp had like 5 golems warp on us at one point and got trained a
ton of other times too). He even offered a copy of KEI and a copy of
Moonfire if he didn't get trained anymore (btw, I never did train ya, so can
I get moonfire for my soon-to-be dr00d?  j/k!).
