Strange, you said the naming laws existed for the "same" reason, then you
went and listed three separate reasons.  The laws against oral sex(I wonder
how many  more times I can type this phrase today) are there to prevent any
kind of "indecency" not just public.  And they are stupid laws.  Much like
the real world, in EQ there are some stupid rules.

It's not about privacy, kitten, it's about a rule being stupid, and how
breaking that rule hurts no one.

And this is precisely while there are so many people breaking the rules.  If
the creators of the rules find their own rules to be too harsh to follow,
why should the players?

Because you said I had no right to criticize someone for repoting a name. I
merely retorted by saying, there's no rule against it, so I have every right
to.

Here's what shoots your credability straight down the porcelain, you've
NEVER found any verant policy unreasonable, which is why most of the people
here have labelled you as a (term from a thread a while back) Verant ass
kisser.

Who did I insult?  You called me a lemming, so I assume that could be
considered an insult as well, Mr Pot.
