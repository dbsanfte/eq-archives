I was hunting the cougars a week ago, had KEI and a brand new pet who 
would still like me for a few more minutes at least, when I saw him pop 
over the hill.  My heart started pumping hard.  Feared my latest victim 
and called off the pet and sicced him on Stormfeather.  Even with the 
pet it was tough.  Took all my available mana and I had to melee some 
after he killed my poor pet. But I killed that sucker.  Now I have his 
map piece and his talons.  Question: should I keep the talons?, sell 
them in bazaar?, or just sell to a merchant?
