A missile defense system is a solution in search of a problem. According 
to the Pentagon itself, the system couldn't cope with an overwhelming 
Russian attack, and as far as everybody else is concerned... Why launch 
a very conspicuous missile and risk immediate, overwhelming retaliation, 
when there are much simpler and cheaper ways to hurt the US, as 9/11 
painfully illustrated?
