I fried my HD and had to do a complete restore to my comp and now I have a
problem with my EQ settings.
I was use to using the "arrow" keys to move around, stand from sitting,
panning the area I was in, etc.  I went to settings and it was set to "shift
UP" as the main and "8" for alt for going forward. (the otheres were the
same style for back, left and right)
This will 99% of the time default to the keypad settings.  I changed them to
"UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT" for the mains and the alts, "Shift UP", etc
for the alts, changed them all to "UP", etc for both, "E" etc for the alts
and almost every thing I can think of.

What/how do I make it so I can just hit the arrow keys and move/pan?   I am
sure this is something real simple I am missing it, and if I have to I can
learn a new way, but I am old and lazy and stubborn.

TIA,
Ben on The Nameless
