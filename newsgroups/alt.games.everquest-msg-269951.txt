So, when everyone in your group just teleports to your next hunting
ground you surely say "see you in an hour there folks". Please! This
won't work. Atmosphere in a mmorpg does not only stems from the gfx
around you but from the folks around you too. So if everyone ports as he
likes then this aspect of the game is hammered onto yourself.

If you can't see the point in hiking don't argue. It's a dead horse
already. :) I'm at Rumbledor's side at the matter but since pok books are
there I just move on.

I don't complain about the books as I did my exploring - but mostly
solo. Alot of zones won't see a visitor since PoP books are there to skip
them. But it's sad when you hear in PoK 'need port to zone xyz' when you
just have to walk 2 or 3 zones away from a pok book. There is alot more
to see in EQ than the mobs you hunt.
