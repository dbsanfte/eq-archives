Haste is important but so is AC,  if you are having trouble getting and
holding aggro the go with the FBSS. But with SLTW haste and 2 fast weapons I
would go for the Guardian Girdle. You mentioned wasted finger slots what
rings do you have? I would have a pair of Velium Fire Opal rings or a couple
jagged bands if str was an issue. AC and HP are your main concern as a Tank
just as long as STA is over 100 and a decent DEX if you have procing
weapons.
