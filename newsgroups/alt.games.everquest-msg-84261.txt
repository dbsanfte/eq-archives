I think the secret is to not game in EC. As a zone it tends to attract
people power-levelling alts or buying gear for twinks. And while
they sit in the zone buying dual lammy's for their level 5 warrior they
might as well pick up a couple of backpacks of belts, which is after
all tradeable xp. And then when they play the level 5 warrior the more
belts they can get the faster they can level.

I have met good people in EC, I have even been in good orc groups, but
the chance of a good evenings play is somewhat reduced.
