That is a most interesting question coming from somebody who routinely
bots support characters.  :)

Another poster suggested killing the dwarf king as an even easier way
to do it.  I'd say that fixing faction would happen if the wizards
found it more convenient to not be KoS than to not bother with faction.
If not fixing faction increased therisk of failure significantly, they
can easily fix faction and so that risk, which somebody (you?) brought
up as a challenge to a claim that MB allowed risk-free kills, is not
relevant, if it would present any real dificulty it can be abated
without a great deal of effort.  And if "fixing faction just doesn't
really happen" then that risk must be so small as to be not even
worth mentioning.
