My favorite one was one that I petitioned: Kunalinktus
I actually had to explain to the gm about that one.
Went something like this:

/report Kunalinktus
/petition There is a guy here with an offensive name Kunalinktus, you might
want to look in to it.

GM: "Hello, GM soandso here about your petition."

Me: "Hello, yes I sent in the petition about that guys name."

GM: "Is there something offensive about it?"

Me: "?? umm try saying it out loud please."

GM: "Sorry I do not see what is offensive about it, is it a foreign language
offensive term?"

Me: "Umm no its an English word all right."
Me: "Do you have an unabridged dictionary handy?"

GM: "Yes I do. I'll look it up.

Me: "Wait. Try looking up >> cunnilingus, its the correct spelling."

... 2 minutes pass...

GM: "Oh my yes that will have to be changed, thank you for bringing this
to our attention."

Me: "np"

/em bangs head on desk and refrains from screaming that Verant
should hire people with a 4th grade education.
