...at which point you have a lot of tanks :)

I partied with a mage and a necro with my mage once, and it rocked. My pet 
was Earth, and had taunting on, while the other mage had a notaunting fire 
pet. We would tell the pets to /pet guard here, and then go pull with some 
wimpy spell, then med through the fight, occasionally damage shielding a 
pet or burning it out.
