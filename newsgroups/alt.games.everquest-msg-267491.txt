That's kind of been my take on them to this point, though I've still 
admittedly yet to reach level 10, so that may well change.

My initial thoughts were that they *will* be hugely important in some of 
the more difficult encounters later in the game. Otherwise, I don't see 
much sense in them, other than just to give us something more to do than 
basic button mashing.

I guess it would make more sense than having the encounters be designed 
around the CHeal as in EQL. At least HO's are designed around teamwork.
