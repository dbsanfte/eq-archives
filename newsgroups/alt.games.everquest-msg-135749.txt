I had to quit EQ for about 4 months because I had to move back in with
my parents due to being laid off at work, and their computer was not
capable of running it due to a slow connection and a crappy video
card. It was a Rage Fury Pro, and made the game unplayable by making
everything so damn dark it was like playing a barb at night in Halas
during a snowstorm, even though I was playing my vah shir (a race with
infravision). I've managed to swap the video card out for a GeForce4,
and convince them to get a cable modem, so my hardware problems are
over.However, all my game CDs are in storage, and I don't feel like
rooting through three dozen boxes piled in a 12'X12' room looking for
them so I can install them on my parents' computer. My own (faster)
computer is also set up here and has the EQ directory on it still, but
is not able to be connected to the internet or networked to the first
due to space concerns, and the fact that my hub is probably somewhere
near my EQ CDs. Both of them might as well be on the moon. My computer
has a CD-RW, so I can put some of the EQ directory on one of those and
transfer it to my parents' machine. I remember someone mentioning
awhile ago that it was possible to download all the missing game
files, if you just had some of them. My question is, what files do I
need to download the other files?
