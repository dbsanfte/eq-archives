There is a guild on my server (Tarew Marr) who had the same problem during
one of the big patches about a month or two ago...

It seemed that every person in that particular guild had the same exact
symptoms...  they had non guilded alts which were able to logon fine.  They
petitioned and emailed the GM from the Sony website, and after 3 days (long
time for such a serious problem) a senior GM was able to determine that
there was a problem with their guild tag or something...he had to manually
disband that entire guild...then everyone was able to logon fine again.  He
then re-created the guild and everyone re-joined...except, I'm sure, for
those poor folks who haven't logged on for 3 or 4 weeks and just logged on
and assumed they were banned from the guild...

If you and your wife are in the same guild, see if you can tell from a new
toon if there is anyone from your guild online...perhaps everyone believes
its a problem with their PC and that may not be the case.  Let me know if
that helps any!
