No druids should get cheal because there are 3 main priest healer classes
and druids happen to be one of them. We need healers that are in the same
ballpark if we are to make  use of all of them. At the moment it takes 6 60
druids to heal as well as 1 45 cleric and that should be far closer to 3 60
druids being the equal of 2 60 clerics.

Druids should get cheal since they have very low utility on raids and in
groups.

Druids should get cheal to help rebalance clerics as not so dominant.

Right now the situation is so stupid as to be almost funny. Reminds me of
the recent story of our federal goverment profesional airport screeners .
One of whom would not let a DEA agent on the plane with his nailclippers.
The gun was fine since he was a federal law enforcement agent and they get
to carry guns but the nailclippers could be used as a weapon and so he could
not take them. (happened)

It needs to be fixed so that eq can grow , and so that the testers and
designers can maybe one day hold their heads high and say we did this game ,
we made it , and it is good. Instead of being a laughing stock like they are
now.
