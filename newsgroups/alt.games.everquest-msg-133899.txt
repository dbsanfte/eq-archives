When Jakugg (troll warrior) and Tiru (dwarf cleric) went hunting together,
if my mana was good, I would often stun mobs- this keeps them from a.
running away and b. hurting Jak so I didn't have to heal as often. I had one
hot key that tried to cast two or three spells- and they would all be stuns.
This was needed because of the long refresh time on stuns. And sometimes
when mana is good, I'd just nuke at the end to finish off the mob. I never
bothered with mellee after level 15 or so. Although, I do know a cleric who
has 1hb, 2hb, and hand to hand maxed. Her ranger partner allowed her to slow
down their XP grinds and work on those skills.

But during raids, aye, it's one trick pony time.

Clerics heal. Anything else is secondary, and possibly bonus. Good clerics
can do more than just heal. Good groups will let them.
