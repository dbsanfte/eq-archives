Hi:

Once again, I seek the counsel of the better-informed.

Today's subject is Focus Items.

As a base of reference, I added the following items to
my Level 47 druid:

neck:	Crysoberyl Talisman(AC5 WIS3 MAN20)
  focus: Affliction Haste II - Dec DoT casting time 33%
wrist:	chipped bone bracers(AC4 Wis5)
  focus: Affliction Efficiency II - Dec DoT mana cost 25%
wrist:  Serpentine Bracer(AC1 Agi9 Dex3)
  focus: Extended Affliction II - Inc dur on DoT 20%
should:	Braided Ivy Cords(AC4 WIS5)
  focus: Enhance Haste I - Inc dur on bene spells 30%
Kobold Hide(AC5 AGI3 HP10)
  focus: Extended Affliction II- Inc dur on DoT 20%

I then set out to test them out. Basically, they rock.
With the focus gear on, I can hunt 2 dark blue mobs, snare,
DoT and park them. And toast them both with a blue bub
of mana to spare. When in combat, basically all of the
above are "activated" on appropriate casts.

Without them, I run out of mana before they die.

So, thinking of twinking, I acquired the following items
for my 35 Mage:

neck:  Jedah's Silver Choker(AC5 HP10 Mana10)
  summoned focus: reduces mana 10% on <49 spells
head:  Fine Silk Turban(AC10 FR10)
 Focus: Reagent Conservation II - Dec reag use chance 15%
finger: Clawed Knuckle Ring(HP20)
     focus: Extended Enhancement II	- Inc Bene Spells 15%
   Moonstone Ring(Str3 Mana30) (x2)
     focus: Extended Range II- Inc casting distance 15%
wrist:	Gallenites Jade Bracelet(AC4 HP5 Mana5)		
  summoned focus: +10% on DD spells
Polished Bone Brac.(AC2 WIS3 INT3)		
  focus: Affliction Efficiency I- Dec DoT mana 25%
arms:	gatorscale sleeves(AC6 Int4 HP15)	
    focus: Enhancement Haste I- Inc dur on bene spells 30%
  Embroid. Black Sleeves(AC4 HP10 Man25)	200
    focus: Summoning Efficiency II - Dec sum pet mana 25%
should:	Tavee's Leather Mantle(AC6 HP10 Mana10)
  summoned focus: +10% duration on buffs
feet:	Kobold-hide(AC5 AGI3 HP10)		50	($5)
   focus: Extended Affliction II- Inc dur on DoT 20%

Basically, with summoning and buffing my pets, none
of the above fire off.

In combat, only the Jedah's choker ever fires. This
is testing with an array of DD, rains and AOE's.

What gives? Any ideas?

Thanks in advance, as usual...

m.
