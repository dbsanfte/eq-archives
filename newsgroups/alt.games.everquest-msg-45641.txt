Why. Why not 10x, 20x, 100x? Seems all a bit arbitary to me.

Much as I think rp'ing isnt complete without pvp, pvp just wont work. Too
many kids out ther playing the game will turn it into a frag fest.

This ones already ben commnted on. People will goto wf instead. I dont see
how this benefits the game in any way. It will make it harder to sell and
buy I guess, making for more wasted time. wheee fun.

I can just write their name down to keep track of them if I want. More bits
of paper too keep track of. More fun.

all being /roleplay does the trick. Your idea actually gives people ino
about alignment. (hey, they arnt on the /who list... better avoid them!).
Just leave them as an anonymous name leaves you guessing... as it should be.

So now /who is just used to tell if somone is te same alignment as you,
since we now use /near by default?

*boggle* how will this affect "role-playing"?
