Yes, in the good old days in this group; they'd actually put thought
into a troll post. I miss the "EQ is sexists because female characters
are half naked" or "I like to KS, train, and steal from other players,
ect... But I guess Everquest's warn nature and slowly dwindling
population means we aren't worthy of the class trolls anymore, we
attract the "sloppy seconds" of trolls *sigh*
