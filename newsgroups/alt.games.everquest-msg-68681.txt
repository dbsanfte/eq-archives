|    Is that self-buffed, or unbuffed? My CLERIC is 950 AC / 3000 HPs
|self-buffed, and I wouldn't tank with her for more than short periods.

	That is self-buffed.

	That's life as a Ranger.  Breaking 1000 AC is a major milestone for a
Ranger.  It's not as hard as it used to be -- those 20 points of Defense we
get by 60 help a lot -- but it's still not easy.  My gear is all planar or
post-planar.

	I would argue that most EQ play has little or no risk attached to it, and
as a result the rewards are commesurate.

	There's nothing coming out of there that isn't on a par with areas of
equal difficulty and less inconvenience.

|And given that I've already seen at least one new,
|easy-to-obtain permanent EB item, I doubt the second requirement will
|present much of a challenge.

	I've only heard of two new EB items, and both of them are Grey-related:
one from the Katta quest, and one is an rare drop earring.
