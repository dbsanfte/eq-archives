In addition to that, a lot of the items have been made magic. For example,
the karana raiders sash used to be just "nodrop". Now its "magic", at least
on FV. By the time you get high enough to take these guys, they are turning
green and becoming "trivial". I looked through allakhazams listings on armor
for stuff I could get. Most were either trivial, or too hard. The rest were
very rare spawns. I had to buy just about everything, which was working
pretty well so far. I dont think I want to have to live with TLC permanently
so its back to the dudes for me. Judging by FV's server pop ranking, id say
im far from alone.
