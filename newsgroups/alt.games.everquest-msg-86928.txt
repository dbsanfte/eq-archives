The first thing that happens in your sequence is that you assist your 
current target, which is your Main.  This sets your target to their target, 
which is what you want.

Then, you are announcing your assist, which has the name of the target in 
it, which is NOW the mob.

It's working like it should.  If there worked differently before, it was a 
bug.  Maybe the /assist command was getting sent to the server, your gsay 
line was processed, and then the target finally changed. *shrug*

Just swap the lines in your macro.  Or, don't worry about announcing it.  
The usefulness of this announcement is debatable.
