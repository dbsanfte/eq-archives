    The frogs are about as risk-free as charm kiting gets. You can keep them
snared for ten minutes, so it's not like they ever catch you when charm
breaks. You can single pull all day, because you're outdoors. All you need
to remember is to break charm every so often to re-apply snare. Heck, you
could haste the pet if you liked without making any real change in how much
risk you faced. The necromancers have to work a lot harder to get the same
results.

    I'm very surprised that they train out, except perhaps when they despawn
Carprin. That's the sign of someone that doesn't know what they're doing. I
saw a group recently that trained out from inside of the Bubonian area,
complete with a half dozen flies in tow. It isn't until you see it happen
that you realize exactly how many puslings are down that hallway!
