I actually DID play Magic the Gathering when it first came out, and it was
great. Maybe a 40 dollar initial investment was all you needed at first and you
could trade with friends to make killer decks.  Then I remember a 10 dollar per
week upkeep to buy booster packs.  
     Even as a 13 year old I always worked various jobs, so I had the money to
do it, and being a good business person I got OUT of magic at EXACTLY the right
time and made a FORTUNE selling all those "rare" cards I had traded for or got
lucky to buy in a pack. 
    But for all the money I managed to make off the game, even now people would
look at me silly if I told them I sold a COMPLETE green ALPHA set for whatever
hundreds of dollars I got for it. They'd be like you can get TRIPPLE that now. 
    Now adays I go into the local game store once in a while just to look
around and see what's popular. I know few people play my personal favorite, the
Pen and Paper AD&D games, but it's still there.  But when I look over at the
Magic Tables and see the 12 year olds playing it's like a completely different
world. I can tell which ones have more money then the others simply buy the
size of the shoebox or if their cards are encased in laminated holders that
probably cost 20 cents a piece.  And those 40 year old wack jobs are still
there, playing with the 12-16 year olds just like I remember it when Iw as a
kid.  A strange world indeed, some things never change and other things totally
change.

Only one thing that REALLY amazes me is that I got out of all those things when
I discovered girls...but I still play video games.  I wonder if those 40 year
old wack jobs that hang out with 12 year olds playing card games haven't
discovered video games, or girls. LOL
