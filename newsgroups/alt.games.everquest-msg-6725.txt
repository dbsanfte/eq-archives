Yep, not a damn thing better to do.

Normally, I keep it a good deal more civil, but
once in a while the sarcasm just creeps out.  I
don't think I said a thing I didn't mean though.

My ISP (and apparantly my entire area code)
crashed out yesterday for several hours.  When
I logged back in this morning, in a bad spot in
LGuk with my IVU down, I died.  Memmed up
my spells, zoned back in, IVU up and went back
down for my body... when someone trained a
Bat out on me.  Root, back up... server down.

I'm pretty sure I'm dead again, although that's hard
to predict.  I will at a minimum be standing in
the middle of the bedroom, IVU down, won't that
be fun?  Odds are good I'm back in 35, but as of
log out, I"m still
