I hate to say it but i have found the easiset was to trun a profit at all
levels with trade skills is to equip yourself with backpacks.  Buy 6 fishing
poles and the rest of the slots EXCEPT one with bait (you need two others
for food and water).  Now go to the karanas and fish for Thunder salmon
which i can turn around and sell for well over 3sp each.

4cp for bait and 3 sp for a fish...i was making about 7 gp per stack of fish
as a profit.  At levels 5-10 it wasn't all that bad.  At level 15 people
thought i was crazy to meditate and fish in Black burrow.
