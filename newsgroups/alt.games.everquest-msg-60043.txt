HAHA
oh sorry, how rude of me.
You wont sell these accounts unless someone can get it dirt cheap to perform
sacrifices.
350 is too much, even if you paid that much since the start (which you
probably didnt), youre overcharging. All the person would get are a few
items and a doorway into killing stuff for newer items. Oh and having people
yell at you for sucking in groups.
But thanks for the laugh
