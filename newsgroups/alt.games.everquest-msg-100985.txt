    Assuming Ed's quoting correctly, the question is not whether it makes
the game easier, but whether it makes the game "too easy". I've seen how
quickly the "not so hot" pet gets eaten alive, unable to tank or hit for any
damage (and thus unable to taunt). If a BST can be given a spell that sets
the pet to a specific level, why can't a mage get some spell that ensures
the next summoned pet is one of the top two levels (say) available? That
would reduce the tedium of re-summoning while preserving some sort of
downtime for making a top-level pet.

    I doubt the price of malachite makes any difference except at the lowest
levels, BTW. :-)
