The voice control was an idea that has been abandoned.  I gave it a try with
Dragon.  It worked for a time after I trained it, but then they added the
additional hotkeys.  The voice commands will no longer work to call up the
keybanks nor hot key numbers.  Only the chat commands seem to still work.
At least the old ones do.
So forget about it for the time being.
