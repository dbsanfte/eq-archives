It's been my personal experience that although most ISPs give you DNS
information you don't actually have to enter that information in your dialup
or network card setup.  I was going with the assumption (could very well be
a mistaken one) that this was his case as well.  I've personally run into
cases where I didn't have any trouble until one particular point and when I
did put that DNS info in the problem cleared up.
