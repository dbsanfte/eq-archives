i didn't reinstall - i was thinking if it's a UI thing, i should just
see what happens if i use a different UI (been meaning to try a custom
one)

and it doesn't feel like it would be a zone file since i've deleted
the common zones i visit (pok, guild lobby, guild hall, katta) and
reinstalled them via the patcher

i haven't had time to reinstall or find a UI, so i didn't yet get a
chance to try what you suggested ... but throwing a /w all wiz 60
query at the server right before i zone seems to keep me plugged in
(hasn't failed me yet) so i'm really confident it's a network thing

i'd be happy blaming my isp, it's time warner cable and it's the worst
internet service i've ever paid for...
