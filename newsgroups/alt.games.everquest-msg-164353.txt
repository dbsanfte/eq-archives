Understandable. :-)

My point here was that wizards can *only* hurt MOBs
via magic. Taking away wizzies' ability to cast in combat
would be like taking off the autoattack key for melees.
Limiting them to attacking using bash, for example.

Fair enough, but this is an EQ group, not a general
MMORPG group, so we should at least try to tie the game in. :-)

I believe that for warriors it's called "discipline: aggressive" or
something of the sort.

Sorry, even more flimsy. I know melees' soloing abilities
are fubar. So does anybody else who plays a cleric -
melee survivability is too marginal for them to solo effectively,
and dealing with adds is effectively impossible. And there are
*no* escape options beyond running.

However, I do think the analogy of melee:HP = casters:mana
has some worth. Call them "resources consumed in combat";
melees have lots of HP and no mana (or little mana), which
is *supposed* to make up for the availability of mana, but the
balance is messed up.

The main difference is that a caster might use 50% of their
mana in soloing a blue, whereas a melee might expect to
use 90% of their HP; the margin is too freakin' narrow,
and there are fewer ways to escape.

I've mostly played as a cleric, and most of the groups I've
been in have been melee-heavy. In my experience a melee
of my level can hurt the MOB faster than I can, but I haven't
run the logs to check this... excluding the BattleCleric tactics
of the 50s. Plus of course hurting MOBs is hardly a cleric
specialty (but even a cleric can take down a blue MOB with
50% mana or so).

Basically, shifting magic to "never in combat" would nerf
entire classes into unusability and stop *anybody* from
soloing. Except for uber melees, of course...

I pretty much agree with you, actually. Unfortunately
EQ is not the place for such changes. Which was my
basic point. If Dennis wasn't talking about balance in
EQ... what the heck *was* he talking about?

I was trying to come up with a way of allowing melees
to solo somewhat effectively and with less downtime
than is currently the case without changing the game
fundamentally. I don't think that the melee:HP
= casters:mana analogy is completely worthless, but
you've chosen instead to argue with a point I wasn't making.

To quote the post to which I was replying:

I was trying to come up with another solution. I do
not believe that there is "one and only one" solution.
I do believe that the proposed solution - completely
nerfing magic during combat - has serious flaws. But
shooting down a proposed solution should involve
coming up with a reasonable alternative.

Ergo the part of my posting that you snipped,
concerning coming up with a "melee KEI".
