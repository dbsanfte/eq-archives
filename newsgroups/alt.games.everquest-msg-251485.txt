Via the only online Danish - English translation site I could find, which
is at http://www.tranexp.com:2000/InterTran/ , this came out to:

"Have you considered that lgge the access done your a hiding and beg a visa
dankort.? Or sprge anyone ( yours leave ) about you can be get a agreement
by they about that lne their?"

   Better then nothing, of course, but clearly it choked on a few words. 
For example, according to Danish - English online dictionary I found,
(http://www.freedict.com/onldict/dan.html )  "l�gge" means "lay, lay down,
place, put, put down".  "Dankort" yielded no answers, "sp�rge" = "ask" and
"l�ne" = "lend, borrow, loan".  I also distrusted the translation in the
parentheses, and indeed, found that "for�ldre" came up at the more
contextually logical "parents".

   So doing the substitutions I can, the literal translation I can come up
with is:

"Have you considered that put the access done your a hiding and beg a visa
dankort.? Or ask anyone ( yours parents ) about you can be get a agreement
by they about that borrow their?"

   Or, my loose translation is "Have you considered getting access by
coming out of hiding and begging Visa to send you a bankcard?  Or ask
anyone (your parents) if you can come to some sort of agreement where you
borrow theirs?"

   I admit that the first sentance still seems pretty odd, and I doubt that
I got it right.  But I am fair comfortable that I am in ballpark with the
second part.  I think that this is a pretty fair translation all around,
especially considering that I don't speak a single word of Danish.

   No, I don't know why I did this.  I'm going to blame the stress of
mental fatigue from a very trying day at work.
