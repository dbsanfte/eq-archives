Enchanter friend logged on yesterday while I was trying to kill mammoths 
for cash (trying because someone else had the same idea, and had track 
and ten levels on me), I contacted her and she suggested an LDoN.

Well, sure, I'm always game for just about anything.

Rustled up a group: Berserk, Enchanter, Shaman, Mage, Cleric, Paladin.

I get to Everfrost (which we select based on nobody having a preference, 
and our having been there a couple times already so this will be 
furthering our investment there, tiny though it is), mage shows up and I 
invite him.

Cleric goes LD, never shows back up.  Shaman discusses things, realizes 
LDoN might take longer than the 1 hour he has available.  Paladin 
doesn't have LDoN expansion.  Enchanter shows up gets invited.  We 
utterly strike out getting any replacements.  We remark at how great it 
is that the mage's pet has Temp and HOS from the bazaar.  Think a while. 
  Decide to go anyway.

20 collect, we go to the zone in, buff me and both pets up with haste 
and DS, med to full, go in.  No 5 minute wait while mage summons pet and 
gives it gear and buffs it, we're ready right away, which is to me 
(veteran of 65 mage levels) even sweeter than the fact that the mage pet 
is buffed up in a way that would be impossible in an LDoN in any other 
way.  Start killing.

Here's the plan: I pull, mage assists me and sics pet on my target, 
enchanter mezzes adds, then walks in close and gets hit once to get her 
pet on target as well.  I throw axes and snare, and stun as seems 
prudent.  Ench and mage nuke as seems prudent, and serves as group 
healer by healing pet as needed, till original mob dies.  Then I break a 
mez with a throwing axe and repeat.

This plan works out fairly well, when we have a problem getting an add 
mezed I'm usually able to stun it long enough to remedy things, whenever 
group mana starts to run low I step in and melee as I can heal up during 
the med break; with three of us binding wounds on me while we are all 
sitting this isn't too bad a use of our down time.

Then we hit a small snag; a poison trap.  It does about 350 damage on me 
as a DOT, we have no cure.  The robes will survive that if thats all it 
does... but they'll be fairly low on hp, and we'll want to stop and bind 
wounds on all three of us for a while... if it doesn't turn out worse on 
them for some reason.  Instead, we decide to just have me pull thru it 
back to them.  So I end up sitting out most of the fights binding wounds 
on myself, with the robes helping, while the pets do even more of the 
work.  I figure out how to get thru the room heading out without getting 
poisoned, but never manage to get back with my prey without poison.

Finally we are down to one item left, I pull the mob back to the group, 
and it procedes to charm me.  Mage's pet kills me.  Mage gets charmed 
too.  But somehow the mob still ends up dead; we succede with 30 minutes 
left.  Two whole LDoN points, why only 625 of these and I'll have 
unlocked the whole place!

=====================================================================
Then we add two more to our group, a warrior and a rogue.  Can't find a 
healer of any sort, not even a hybrid.  Again decide to go in anyway. 
Another collect, this time 25.  Now rogue scouts ahead, warrior pulls, 
ench mezzes adds, and we all kill, I snare runners.  Whole group has 
Temp, so we chew thru quite a few mobs, then sit and med while we all 
bandage the warrior.  This also works out with about 24 minutes to 
spare, and we stay out the remaining half hour, kill a named, and get 
fairly good exp for the run.  (I "win" the dropped item, a nearly 
useless thing called a "blood mace".  I put win in quotes because 
everyone turned it down as worthless, and the enchanter gave it to me)

Two more LDoN points, putting my character's life total at 6 in four 
successful missions.  Six more and I'll be able to buff my adventurer's 
stone up one notch, but since it won't fit on my tutorial charm thats 
pretty much a waste of time too.  I'm not at all clear what the 
risk/reward is supposed to be for low end LDoN runs, I guess easy and 
precious little is the answer.  If I'd done nothing but LDoN in one 
mission type I estimate I'd have 30 points by the time I hit level 30... 
and can't think of anything a level 30 would want at that total.

Oh, I won a +2 sta augment on the first mission.  Made a slip with that 
too; put it on an item I have with a reccomended level of 50 (for 25pp 
its current stats are better than anything out there, and it will get 
better as I level), only to find that I only get one of the two sta from 
it due to being too low level for the item!

Grage, 30 Berserk, Luclin
