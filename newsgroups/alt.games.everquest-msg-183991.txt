Charm times work off your charisma, if you can get your charisma up 
without sacrificing too much wis, it may help some.

I love to charm griffawns and sic them on Griffennes, panic the 
griffennes and your pet will survive a lot longer.  Just so you know, 
griffon feathers are a component in qeynos afternoon teas and fleeting 
quivers, don't let them go cheap.

Elephants, might have to use the same strategy as with griff's. Charm 
what you can then panic the higher level one and send the pet in.  Good 
luck hunting in EF, I hate that zone because of the wandering NPCs that 
"help" way too much.  SK has elephants too.

Have fun.
