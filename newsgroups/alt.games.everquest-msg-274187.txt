Actually, the first time I read your post, I took it to have a 
unneccessarily (spelling?) "rude & obnoxious" tone to it and responded 
accordingly.

Now, having taken a break from reading this thread (where entirely too 
many people have become "rude & obnoxious" with each other and 
re-reading your post, I see you were actually in a round-about way 
saying "Please don't sign your posts with a PGP key because it makes it 
hard to follow the thread."

To that my response would be...

"Yes, I see your point. It could make reading my posts difficult, 
especially the shorter one-line replies. I'll be happy to turn it off & 
only sign emails vice newsgroup posts."

Better? :)

Seriously, sorry if I came accross with a bit of an attitude. Wading 
through this thread put me in a foul mood. I shouldn't have gotten cross 
over such a little thing.
