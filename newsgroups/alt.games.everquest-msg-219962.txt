I think you summed up my feelings about it quite well.  It just feels 
like they are moving farther and farther away from the game that I have 
enjoyed playing for some years now.  Like you, I do feel that there are 
things that really needed improvement, but, it just feels like they have 
gone way to far in making the game easy.  Not that I am planning on 
quitting anytime soon, but, I do miss the old days.
