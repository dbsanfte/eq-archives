Will that matter?  What I'm excited about with LDoN is that it will mean
that I can go to my guild boards, announce an LDoN event at a specific date
and time, have people show up, and we can go and have some fun together,
without getting there and finding everything camped.  If we don't get
through to the end...so what?  I haven't seen anything that says you can't
do the same dungeon more than once, so we'll come back some other time, and
maybe get farther.  If it takes us three or four tries to get to the end,
what's wrong with that?
