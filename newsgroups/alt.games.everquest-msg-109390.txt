I was wondering about how Verant can get more people to go adventuring in
dungeons. They've tried alot of things, even giving nice spells to lower
characters, raising XP awards etc. But something that would be better in my
opinion would to have the ability to create 8 man groups, or even
"unlimited" man groups (those who think the group is too big would leave
anyway). Under raiding, it would be great, and give people a bigger
perseption of cooperation.
