It's interesting how things like that can have such a big effect.  In EQ,
you can lock down mobs for a very long time (or forever?).  From what you
say, it looks like in SWG, you can't lock them down much at all.  In DAoC,
you can lock many mobs down, but not forever (my 20ish Healer, for example,
can mez mobs for about 40 seconds, and then remez for 20, then remez for 10,
and so on).

Another interesting thing is healing in different games.  In EQ, higher
level heals, besides healing more, also get more mana efficient.  So, it
is better to use big heals on deeply wounded characters than small heals on
lightly wounded characters.  Also, healing small and early often gets aggro
on the healer, I'm told.  Putting all this together, it strongly pushes
toward a main tank with a lot of HP, so you can let him take a lot of
damage, and then CH.  In DAoC, on the other hand, all my Healer's heals are
about the same mana efficiency.  I've basically got a fast small heal,
a less fast medium heal, a slow large heal, and a slower very large heal.
The bigger heals are faster hp/sec, even though slower in total time.
The smaller heals are slightly more efficient, but not by a lot.  Small early
heals don't seem to cause much aggro, unless I'm standing very near the mob.
So, while a big beefy tank is nice in that if something goes wrong (like, we
get a lot of adds and it takes a while to get that under control) he won't
die, from a healer mana point of view, I'm just as happy with a couple
lighter tanks splitting the damage.  Unless I'm busy with something, I'll
use my small heals often, keeping everyone near full, only using the large
heals to catch up if I get behind for some reason.

How does healing work in SWG?  Does it encourage the EQ-style MT, or the
DAoC-style "the more the merrier" tanking, or something else?
