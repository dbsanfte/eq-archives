Keep in mind that enchanters are much better stunners than clerics in that
they cost less, last longer, are  AE and do not noticeably aggro.  If you
have an enchanter in the group (and you mentioned mezzing so I'm assuming
you do)  and if they're not stunning and are open to suggestion, suggest
THEY do the chain stunning.

I think all clerics should have LEVEL 5 stun up, though (the one that
doesn't do damage)...to cast on the critter beating on your enchanter who is
TRYING to mez the critter.  Even if they're chain-stunning that critter (and
I hope they are!) to give themselves time to mez it, it certainly DOES NOT
hurt to toss in your own LEVEL FIVE stun.
