  It's impossible that they didn't notice it in testing, unless they
don't test at all.  What most likely happened is that some suit
decided to force the release of Luclin (and thus, the new
umbra-crippled engine) to us on the overly optimistic release date
they had planned, without bothering to give those of us who they knew
it would cause performance issues for, any option to disable it.

  This is one of the reasons that I have less respect for Verant than
any other software/gaming company that I have ever patronized.
