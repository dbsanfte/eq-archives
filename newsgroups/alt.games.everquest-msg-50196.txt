Does this mean that we can only have horses while on Luclin?  I get this
from the second page where it's quoted:

"You can get to Luclin via wizard spires scattered about Norrath, but once
there, you'll want to saddle up as soon as you can pony up the cash."

I was hoping that we could have them in the old world also.  Any ideas?
