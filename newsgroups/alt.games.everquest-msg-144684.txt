Ok  My ideas on this.  First, they look great!  I am definately
looking forward to seeing this released.  I would have liked
to see more character models though.  Hardware on the other
hand has a while to catch up.  I don't doubt at all that they had
the biggest machine they could put together to show it all off
and it was still a little choppy in places.  Hopefully by the time
they release it, hardware will be up to par with the software.
I know I will be looking forward to it.
