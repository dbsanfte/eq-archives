You get used to that after a while. Some idiot like Thott will tossed
around numbers like that for shaman canni but everyone forgets that it
isn't passive either. Even necros have to get the hitpoints back from
their mana regen spells. 

Maybe there's a silver lining for mages, from what I understand the
canni scales with pet hitpoints which might mean you get really awesom
pets with the next expansion.  May the nerf bat not hit you too hard!
