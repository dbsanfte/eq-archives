This is very true.  Not all blues are equal... In fact, there is some
webpage that sort of explains Hell Levels as well, mostly due to the fact
that mobs have a set numerical xp associated with their level, not how they
con to you that determines how fast you go up XP wise.  It also states
which classes and races might have a better chance at leveling than others,
which seems to be Halflings. (Right now, the article is pretty old, so
dunno how much of it stands up against things now...)

Again, true...  A level 60 will have better stuff than a Level 55 with
mental clarity.  But also to be fair, that Level 60 will probably have
better gear as well, and the Protection of the Glade.  Although when that
55 gets to 60 with Protection of the Glade, he will have the option of
having a 9 mana per tick boost, or if someone with C2 or C3, the extra
boost with mental clarity will definitely help.  Again, while this could be
done in Level 60, a Druid near the 50s could solo some of the lower level
mobs, get the alt advance points and dump them into the required areas and
then go up in levels, making money at the same time.  Yes, it is slow
going, and you still will not have the larger mana pool that a higher level
will have, but making up for it with some of those abilities does help out
if they have the ability to do something that another, higher level cannot
do.  It is just like 'Specialization' on crack.  You suffer in some areas
to gain benefits in one particular area.

Again, true.  However, there are some players, myself included, that may
have made a character poorly.  I ran into a few with my current druid, who
stated they were going to spend time dumping xp into Alt advance due to the
fact they made character generation mistakes and were too far along to go
'Dump and remake'.  I have a human cleric on another server I gave up on
because I made the character be D&D balanced, not Everquest saavy, putting
not enough wisdom and now that cleric, as one player balked at me at one
point, is mana poor and somewhat useless.

Hate to say this... Being on Raids, like Plane of Fear, is that Raids
themselves are not the best way to get XP sometime unless you were going to
be in the Main Assist group, or the group that will be doing the most
damage.  In most cases, there is no guarenteed way for anyone to gain XP in
large raids, it is only guarenteed that there is a chance of you getting
something nice for your character and that you will be spending a long time
in the zone doing so.
