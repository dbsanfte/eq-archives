Mages aren't real "solo" classes. You'd better stick to a druid or necro, or
if you want to go all the way shammie or wizard.

For the melees the only 3 real solo-able classes are bard, monk and
shadowknight. Ranger somewhat, but has a hard time killing anything at a
decent rate.

Only comparing monk and mage:

Monk:
+ FD
+ serious damage output
+ bind wound & mend
+ CR isn't that bad considering you can still kill most things with just
your hands
+/- instill doubt, monk fear-kite !
- no gate
- weight limit, hard to gain a lot of cash when you can't carry much loot
till you drop in ac

Mage:
+ pet
+ nukes when things get rough and for general damage
+ gate to flee
+ lev, invis
- only gate as escape. No shadow step, root, stun, port, evac, fear, etc
- pet control
- summons. food, drink, bags, ultravision stone, EB stone, small weapons for
the starting levels, it's all free
+/- bind wound. free bandages, but only 100 max skill in bind wound

Simply put, take what YOU think suits you better. I'd advice to start a monk
but keep your mage. Get them both to 20-24 or so and then decide which you
want to take up to 60. If you just want a fast solo career, take a druid.
