well, i would have done this but for one thing...  i was able to get out of
the water before i was killed... i ran into a tunnel that was being spawned
by some more of those cones...  and basically i was being CC by NPC's until
i got the corpse far enough away so that they wont agro on me...  yesh it
sucked...  but it beats starting over... and i didn't have a coffin, never
knew they sold anywhere.. i thot they were a summoned thing.  those things
were able to kill me with 5 hits...  they were beating me for 150 - 200 a
hit.  halfling warriors don't enjoy a high hit point value like dwarfs and
barbs..
