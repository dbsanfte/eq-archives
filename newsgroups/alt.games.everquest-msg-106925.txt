No such animal basically.  Druids don't get much in the way of
'special' armor.  (QUICK, somebody start a petition!)

Depending on your race/class combo, you can always look into cultural
armor.  At level 30ish you could get a group, a very, very, very, VERY
patient group and start on the Paw of Opalla quest.  Nice main hand
item.  Gives like 9 ac, 9 wis, 9 agi -5 cha and -*mumble* disease.

Basically, go check out www.eqdruids.com and check out the item lists.
They have a nice rated list so you can check out what has what
benefits, and what you should be looking at by way of armor.
