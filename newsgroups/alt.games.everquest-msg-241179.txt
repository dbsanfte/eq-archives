Thing is... more than a macro program.. which is designed to just use
the current interface to iterate common tasks via a script, where
things really open up is when you can create a third-party program to
sit on top of Everquest. Once you can release yourself from the
restrictions of the current interface, you can create your own
interface designed to allow the user to receive such information in a
concise manner and likewise respond to it much easier than having 72
complete seperate windows. If you can also splice apart the graphics
from having to actually be rendered except when needed, and since this
is on the user computer Sony isn't tipped off, you remove a lot of the
system overhead. The down side is you have to keep up with the Joneses
on patches ala ShowEQ.

The really interesting stuff comes if a yang comes to Sony's yin. Then
you'll have an all out war between Sony and Third-Party programmers to
see who can keep up with each other. ShowEQ was an interesting start,
but it was really just the breaking down of the communications
protocol Sony used and then providing an interface to the information.
When Everquest itself actually starts getting torn apart it'll be all
out war to obfuscate the executable on one side and break it fast on
the other. For example, Sony or another company creating a program
with which to randomly reorder datasets and the pointers to such,
where code is located, etc all without changing the original source
code . I.e. A post processing of the binary to create a completely new
binary that does the same thing with completely different locations
for everything, and then posting that with the next patch. The real
war will typically be fought here, rather than ingame with GM's trying
to trip people up.

EXACTLY :>. Information overload for GM's allready stressed out from

Yup.. nail.. head.
