So it really is as simple as a straight ratio?  Damn, I was thinking
there were several aspect to this.  Too easy.

Thanks for the reply and clarification.  Berserker is the class and
both weapons are 2hs.  Thinking I'll stay with what I have since the
slight upgrade for the proc will cost me greatly.  Not doing bad with
the current weapon just always on the lookout for better.

From most conversations I've had in game it seems my current weapon is
the best I can get (lvl restrictions) until my epic 1.0.  Now that
weapon is cool.
