Not as such, except you picked the right numbers to prove your point.

What happens if the target has 30 hp? The single weapon will kill it on the
first hit, while the dual wields will take three hits (2 extra seconds of
taking damage!). The numbers will come out in different directions
depending on the ratio of the damages of the two weapons, and the amount of
hp the target has. It's true that for any combination of weapons, and
target hp, the faster weapons will come out slightly ahead slightly more
of the time, but all in all, the difference is extremely minor and in
the case of having "wasted" seconds at the end of a fight with the slower
weapon, it might to take you longer than that to start fighting the
next target anyway.

That said, I think about similar strategy issues all the time, although
I think it's more relevant to spell casters. As a wizard, I have to work out
whether it's more appropriate in a given fight to go with a couple of big
nukes, or a larger bunch of smaller nukes (or a combo). Even given two
with the same peak efficiency, I need to weigh mana costs, casting times
and recast times, resists on different types of nukes, and aggro. If all
I had to do to min/max my efficiency was think about the speed of my
weapons... I'd probably be bored and quit.
