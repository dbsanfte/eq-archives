Why thank you very much, jerk, i didn't buy it on ebay.  I got 3 keys from
Najena, 4 keys from ToFS and one for Skyshrine.  I know what my keys are for
right now, but I want to know if there's a list of what keys go where.  You
know, the Crystal key goes in the first floor ToFS mirror...something like
that.  I just know I'm going to forget.

Thank you in advance,
Raven
