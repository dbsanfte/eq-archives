Just to cover the extreme low end robes, for purpose of not looking
like a pure newbie:

Gossimer is wt.1, ac 8, costs around 20 pp and is a pretty white color
- I just picked one up to give my lvl 3 gnome mage an alternative to
the golden newbie look :)
Damask and raw silk robes are both AC 6 and sell for 5-10pp.
Thaumaturgist's robe is AC 5 wt 3.5 agi+3 and sells for around 20 pp.
The raw silk and thaum robes are both brown (thaum a little redder
than the silk) and the damask robe is light grey.
