Level him to 60.  When you get to near 60 apply to an UBER guild.  High end
game is pretty cool...  err  unless you can't put up with being glued to
your chair for 12 hours straight.

Get one character to 60...  just so that when your an old man, you can tell
the young geeks you had a 60 level in EQ way back when.  This game is
destined to be a legend.
