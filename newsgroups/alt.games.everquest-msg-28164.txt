I've had the same experience (no pun intended) with "hell" levels.
I've purposely relaxed during hell levels, taken some time off,
gone sightseeing, done some quests, etc. -- specifically so that
I *wouldn't* obsess over how slowly the exp bar was crawling.

And oddly enough, I've gotten through some of my hell levels faster
than my non-hell, "work on nothing but gaining exp" levels.
