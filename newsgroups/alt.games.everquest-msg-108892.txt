    I'm convinced what makes them really hard is that proc - it looks
unresistable. You have a wizard - did you identify what spells it was
casting? I'd love to know if the Lotus cheats like the Shissar Arcanists do
in Ssra. (The Shissar Arcanists are sub-60 mobs that cast a bevy of level 60
wizard nukes, like Sunstrike.)

    What really sucks is when someone tries that lotus near the tunnel to
Echo and fails. Those things have poor regen, even when unengaged, so if the
next person coming up the tunnel doesn't know the plant is there they get
nuked and chain-summoned. Once watched the thing eat three people in a row
that way. That's why it feels like such sweet revenge to send the Dire
Charmed, Shissared Chaktai Fungusbeast onto one. They hit so fast and hard
once dual wielding that the lotus can't channel through.
