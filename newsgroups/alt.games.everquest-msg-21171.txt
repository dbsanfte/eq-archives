I have similar issues with people yelling for sow before theirs has
dropped, especially when I can't overwrite the old sow. (I also once
cast sow on myself while the icon was fading, only to have the new sow
end when the old one ended.
In a good group, I never have to tell the enchanter to give me
clarity. The one I was grouped with last night not only didn't offer
it when I joined group, but I had to ask for it multiple times when
the one I had from the night before wore off - one of many factors
that made me discreetly look for another group.

I have a slight boost to poison and fire resists in my gear, the rest
are base value. And I still spend most of my hunting time without my
resist buffs; they're more of a special occasion thing. The resists do
help, but as of yet it's very rare that I am hunting anywhere that
they're needed. Other buffs are more important.
