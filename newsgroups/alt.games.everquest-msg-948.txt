Moreover, there IS a rec.games.everquest but it is not heavily
carried.  Why, I dont know but I remember voting it through yet I cant
get it at home, at work or on Dejanews(Though I havent checked Deja in
a while.)  <grin>

Perhaps THAT question (why RGEQ isnt avaialable) should be in the FAQ,
I'd certainly like to know.
