Well, Im going to try a Mage/Bard combo.

I have a 35th mage and I thought bards would be the best parnter.  Mainly
because they can regenerate mana.  Enchanters can do this obviously, but
bards have a lot of other helpers with their songs, and they can act as a
bit of a meat shield if needed.

Why Mage you ask?  Because I've always liked them...  Also, supposedly
casters are going to be getting un-nerfed soon if these messages we're
getting are any indication, so who knows.
