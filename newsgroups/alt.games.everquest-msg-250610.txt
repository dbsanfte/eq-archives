Sometimes mobs spawn back at the teleport up area and warp thru into
Grieg's "room".  Back when we were doing GV best tactic we had was to
keep a SK to tank GV, just continually mashing his best agro spell
since the MT will be perma-blind.  Keep a few melee up there with
GV to call AE and get flung about as well as to add like 2dps. :)
Casters and the rest of the melee stay down in the pre-port up area
to a) keep that backspawn cleared, and b) to not die to GV AE.  Clerics
can heal from there and after AE is called other casters can pop up
nuke, then pop back down.
