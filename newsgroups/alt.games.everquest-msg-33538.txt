You are absolutely right. It still amazes me how my wife's wizard always has
at least twice the amount of money I have. Not to mention gear. I mean, she
does not beg for money, of course. But for some reason she always gets to
loot the nice stuff, gets better prices in EC auctions, these kind of
things. And, my god, you would not belive her luck at rolls. Of course, it
does not matter that the character is female, you still need to be polite.
But still ... there's something about these wood elves, wouldn't you say ?
