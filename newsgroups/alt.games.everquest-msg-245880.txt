Looking for your opinions here. I havent tried yet and Im afraid of the
initial breakin. Last time I was in Fear was a long long time ago but things
have changed drastically since then. My goal is to get an AON from Dread.
Heres how...

I 3box a Pal Sham Monk all 65 all over 200aa all EP gear. I can trio most
zones including Fire, SolRo, PoE,  etc. (Obviously not minis)

Heres my plan for fear, what do you think?
1. Monk breaks in see's how hard mobs hit, if wimpy trains zi mobs away, if
painful FD and flop somewhere safe, then gate and give up.
2. Pal and Sham zi run to wall, monk eventually catches up.
3. Pull to Dread. Now the fun part.
4. Monk pulls Dread (Does he DT on pull like Fright?). Monk tanks dread
while shammy and pally heal. Monk gets DT'd, pally rezes monk, then tanks,
monk dps the rest of the fight. If Dread does not DT on pull I think its
possible, I think I can beat him down quick enough where he only lets off 1
DT. If Im not mistaken its 1 per 2 minutes?

So questions:
1. Does Dread DT on pull?
2. Is his DT every 2 minutes like Im told?
3. How hard do you think Dread hit a Pally with 1600+AC all stats maxed at
305?
4. Do you think this is possible?
