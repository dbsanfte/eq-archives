Well this is an old computer and I'm not looking to dump additional
funds to it since I'm planning to purchase another computer. I just
need this extra comp for my brother to play on so we can play EQ.

Chances are we're not going to do Planes of Power or some of the later
expansions. I was able to run EQ successfully (although not with ALL
particles on and such) with Original and Kunark using the 250W power
supply AND a 8MB video card, and 96MB RAM, believe it or not. :)

How much has changed with Velious, Luclin and such?
