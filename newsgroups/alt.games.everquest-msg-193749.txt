Everything I have written using the addresses white_prophet?@yahoo.com is to
be considered false. Any legal action taken against me regarding usenet
abuse will be plead guilty to. I feel that communicating via usenet should
be a privledge, one that I am clearly not deserving of. I have canceled my
usenet account and will not be renewing it.

The last thing I wrote, "It is better to have a friend in hell that to be
alone in heaven", is quite deceptive in nature as one cannot be alone in
heaven as God is there and God is trying to save me right now.
