Well, I don't know how many of you guys have studied History. But the
Jews have been hated by many for centuries, from Pharohs to
Palestinians, Turks and Nazis. 
What it is that they did to be hated is unknown to me on some matters
but others are documented.
One example is what the jews did to the Japanese during WW2.
When the Japanese Americans were put into camps here in "America",
they lost all there earnings and property that they had earned by hard
work when the Jewish bankers and busniess men forced the banks to sell
them the property the Japanese owned. People lost everything, homes,
shops, and companies that they started. Of course at this time they
did not know what was going on in Europe, maybe if they had they
would'nt have been in such a hurry to profit from someone else's
misery.
But it just wasn't Jews doing this it was quite a bit of people taking
advantage of the situation but the primary reason was the pressure
from jewish business.
But every religion is gulity of something in history.
But why it is that people have a dislike to jews I just don't know. 
I've traveled around this world in my life , from Europe to Asia to
Latin America and for some reason people always have a dislike for
jews, Not a hatred mind you just a dislike. I don't get it.
Religions don't bother me, Assholes do.
