After about three weeks of wrangling with BT to restore my ADSL connection
(fault - but I'm still not sure whether it was my fault or theirs so I'll
say no more about it) I can say I'm not having any problems at all.  It's
FAR better than the 56k modem I used to use, although I think that was down
to a cheap and nasty modem than anything else.

But as one of those annoying people who are probably CAUSING your problems
(ie the paupers who only signed up when the price came down), I can tell you
that - as they tell me - the larger-than-expected uptake for the Broadband
500 Plug & Go offer has thrown them a complete curve ball and they're
struggling to sort the problems out.  BT are fine, but the engineering
contractors they're using are utterly useless and don't give a toss about
the end user (reading between the lines I can guess it's annoying BT as much
as it is the customers).  Having said that, they WILL sort the difficulties
out, but they're just having some 'getting used to it' time and I imagine
that's what's caused your drop in performance.  Am I forgiven?  :)
