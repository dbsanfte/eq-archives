Weird thing is,I remember visiting EK some weeks ago and 3 HGs
*upon* the surface on arrival,after killing HGs for some time every
resapwn was *upon* the surface,so I thought they had fixed it.

Found some more zones today with mobs under the surface,EC,Nro
and BB,in all these zones most of the spiderlings were under the 
surface of hills,dont laugh,spiderlings are pretty valuable for
tradeskillers.Supply of spiderling silk at the moment in Bazaar
is exactly 1(one).
