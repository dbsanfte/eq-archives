I know.  But guess what, i DONT care.

As much as I thank you for your opinion and input, I couldn't give 2 fucks
for anybody who wants to correct my grammer and spelling in a GAME related
newsgroup.

I don't wear a tie and dress formal out of the office, I like to chill out
and relax.

If i am writing a business letter/something else of an official nature, then
yes its formal.  When im writing to a game related newsgroup, it isn't.

Most of my posts are when im at work (this is maybe my third ever from home)
while im waiting on something to finish, waiting for somebody to become
available, taking a little break etc.  Im sorry if I don't have the time
effort and desire to analyse my posts before clicking the Send button, but
please tell me just *ONE* way how my informal writing style makes my posts
and comments invalid?

Give me one example how the way I write makes me less right when advising
other people.  One example please of how my pulling in high-end raids is
somewhat inadaquate because I don't sit here and write nice fancy english
degree style posts.

But this isn't a cv (resume).  This isn't a job application.  This is a GAME
newsgroup, where I come for informal discussions about a game I play.

Not that it matters, but I received an A grade in both English literature
and language when i was at school (final end of school exams in the UK)

I've seen people who speak English as a *second* language get flamed here
for spelling something wrong.

If thats not a reason enough why flaming somebodies grammer and spelling in
a game newsgroup is pathetic, then I don't know what is.
