The fastest chars Ive levelled have been enchanter and cleric, with the
cleric flightly faster. I tend to play for long sessions, and as a cleric  I
can hold a group together pretty much indefinitly (ok some times there are
*no* tanks, but not often). It was about 8.5 played days to level 50. I
think the chanter took about 10.
