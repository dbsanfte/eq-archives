Here's a message from the Missing the Point Dept.

I think KEI is a wonderful thing.  I love it on all my casters, no
matter what level my character is.  In fact, I love it even more the
more absurdly unbalanced and unreasonable having KEI is (ie. on a
level 12 instead of a level 65).

That doesn't mean I'm not aware of and concerned with the huge
imbalance issues the widespread use of it engenders.  To deliberately
or ignorantly refuse to acknowledge that just reveals your own high
level of self-absorption.

Much the same, I love the ZEMs of places like Paludal, High Keep and
the PoP Planes, but that doesn't make me oblivious to the negative
impact they've had on the rest of the game.
