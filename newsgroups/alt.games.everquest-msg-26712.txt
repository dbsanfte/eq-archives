These issues with the Sound Blaster Live! sound cards and Windows 2000
are driver related, and will not be able to be fixed by a patch. 
Creative Labs released new drivers for the SB Live! 5.1 series sound
cards on 4/17/01. If you have this card, you may want to try upgrading
your drivers to see if this will fix the audio problems you are
having.

This is their standard answer, Verant clains they are not at fault and
wont do anything about it.  Complain to Creative like I am....

The bottom line is that win2k and Soundblaster are TOTALLY hosed.
Those that get good results are the 1 percent minority.

Switch back to 98 if you value sound in EQ.
