I have recently upgraded my video card and memory so that I could play
Luclin. I am now thinking of upgrading my sound card since I only have a
Sound Blaster 16. I have two questions for the group.

1. Does upgrading your sound card make a difference? I only really play EQ
and surf the web.

2. Is there a site that reviews soundcards? If so what is it?

Thanks to all who respond. :)
