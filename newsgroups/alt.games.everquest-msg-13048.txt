But "plz" is widely understood by the community. You're not suggesting
you didn't *know* that it is a short-hand way of saying "please" are
you?

>and your other examples which are simply a combination of lazy typing 

"SoW" is lazy typing. What other explanation is there? "SoW" goes
totally against the grain as far as roleplay is concerned. Your
character wouldn't say "sow", they'd say the words in full.... so
shortening it to SoW is lazy typing.

I can see where people are coming from when they condemn lazy typing
(although I disagree with them) but for pity's sake; show some
consistency!

>and doodspeak.

Not everyone who says "plz" is a d00d.

Not all "d00ds" are bad. 

To suggest otherwise is out-and-out prejudice and stereotyping.
