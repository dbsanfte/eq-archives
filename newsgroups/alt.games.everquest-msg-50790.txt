> Are casters inherently better off than equip-dependent classes???  Hmmmm

as a 43 SK, my plan of action would be (assuming i began in antonica, with
no equiptment, no plat, and was forbidden to buy items from pc's):

head to RM and kill/loot weapons from a few lizardmen, then start working
some giants for plat to make banded
(could probably be outfitted enough in about 3 hours)

btw, is the goal to be near equally equipped as when you started? or just
survivable?
