Lol - I had real problems learning to play my enchanter:
I play almost exclusively with the keyboard, very little
mousing.  I have a generic assist key, MA and SA keys
as well as the "Target Nearest NPC" key (mapped to q).

A trick I use to get the unengaged mob in a double pull is
/pet back off (hotkey), esc, ctrl+shift+s (sit).  I take 
a few hundred points of damage, but it's the fastest way
to get the add away from the fur-ball and off-tanked by my
pet.
