Yes, but how long does it take you to med back the mana you just used to
heal?  Once you bind up to the max you can, by all means, cast some heals,
and try to balance out the mana and hp regen.  With my baby ranger, I find
that I am using my mana all the time for combat, and don't have a lot of
extra for healing.  Usually when I need to stop due to low hps, I am also
low on mana, so I bind up, then sit and get both mana and hps back.
