I really didn't want to play a druid. Beastlords were implemented after I
left and from what I have read on a few EQ groups are a possability for me.
Does anyone have imput on Monks as solo'ers?  I never played one and have
been reading a few guides, none of which seem to mention their ability to
solo at higher levels (at least none I have seen thus far).
