So do I. So does anyone. But that's not a problem with bottom posting.
That's a problem with lousy quote trimming.

Properly quoted material takes up just a few lines at the top of a
message, or a few lines interspersed in the message - enough to set
the context of the reply, nothing more.

It makes no difference to bandwidth if a message is top-posted or
bottom-posted. In either case, it's the same amount of text.
