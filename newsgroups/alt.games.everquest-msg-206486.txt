5 Lower Guk

lots of undead which is fun for pallies, loot can be great or can be crap.
depends how u feel bout the place and bout dungeons

6 City of Mist

omg omg i love this place, start with entry mobs work your way in gradually
then start to work your way back. with kei it might be difficult so dont go
TOO far in, but there is usually a cpl people in the zone, jus ask for some
help if u get a trouble, try to find around entrance, that way u can zone
out. with ion and that nuke, u'll be fine.
