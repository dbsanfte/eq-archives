You would think that, but I always found charm-kiting to be one of those 
activities that required my full attention.  Plus it's hard to insult the 
druids when you can only type in very short bursts between songs.


/cast 1 (charm)
/shout i've never
/stopsong
/cast 2 (selos)
f8 to target
/pet attack
f1 twice to reselect pet
/shout seen such
/stopsong
/cast 3  (catata for healing)
/shout a worthless, fleabitten
/stopsong
/cast 2
/shout pack of whiny
/stopsong
/cast 3
/shout fleabitten carcasses
/stopsong
/cast 1
/shout that were whelped
/stopsong
/cast 2
f8 to target
/pet attack
hit f1 twice to reselect pet
/shout by a mangy bitch
/stopsong 
/cast 3
