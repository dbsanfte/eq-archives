Well, im still in the 1cp stage at 168 begging, but got 1sp from a guard 
in Rivervale once.

Some NPCs HATE beggars (guard fayfear at the orc lift in GFay kill you 
if you beg), and some just aggro after a few tries. Appearantly at 
higher levels they dont aggro, not sure how high though, since i got 
begging up on begging from mobs during combat.
Guess you need at least 100 to avoid aggro, anyone got some numbers on this?
