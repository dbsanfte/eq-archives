Immersion: [95%]
Grief: [85%]
Achievement: [65%]
Relationship: [55%]
Group Affiiliation: [15%]

I'm rather subtle when it comes to interacting with other players. I
strongly disagreed with scamming/KS-ing and the like, but I am guilty
of occassionally taunting another player (if that person's actions
warrants it). :) 85% Grief for that? Yikes.

But, I am a roleplayer and I guess the results reflect that. :)
