Bash (Slam) and (high level) kick will interrupt spells even with no
movement.  The downside of it is just as a spell can be resisted, your kick
can be dodged, parried, riposted, or just plain miss.

Push.

Melee combat other than bash, slam and (high level) kick will not interrupt
spells, but if you can create movement in the mob through your hits, it will
be interrupted.

Post level 55, warrior kick gains a stun ability, similar to bash.
