Welcome to Phase 4 of the EverQuest BETA Test!

Thank you for participating in the final EverQuest beta phase.

Please keep in mind that this is still BETA.  There will be bugs, there will
be problems.

This lead me to think up the following questions...

#1 Does anyone actually recall there being an announcement that Beta 4 had
actually ENDED?? :o)

#2 Does this mean I'm a sad old fart that's been playing this damn game too
long? :o))

#3 How can I e-mail this to the next 'd33wd' that calls me a 'newbie'? :oD
