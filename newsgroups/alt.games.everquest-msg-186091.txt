The Thurgadin book exists because otherwise there would be no books on
velious at all. The Firiona Vie book exists because otherwise there would
be no good aligned books on kunark at all. There is a starter zone in luclin
so no need for an exemption I guess.

Besides, from what I can tell the whole point of Katta is to be the empty
and pointless ass-end of luclin.
