Played D&D and taped the wrong channel trying to get the StLouis-NewOrleans
on tape so I could watch it later, so played EQ after the D&D session and
got my new fiter from level 6 to level 8....and ate a pint and a half of ice
cream.  I had forgotten how much fun it could be to see your experience
point bar actually move when you're low level.
