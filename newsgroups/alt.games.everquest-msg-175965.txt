Since when did unrest have an exp bonus? Or were you referring to
something else? It IS nice to PL there tho up till about low 20s for
the reasons you mentioned. A high level druid can window shop there
nicely. But I usually move on once I hit 20 (to CC or MS). Of course
since Luclin, usually getting to 20 in Paludal is much faster.
