I have a problem with gear in the fact that to acheive a 100 plat at
level 30 is painfully boring and I also do not hog the bazaar nor sell
in it, and the bazaar pricing is just out of this world.

The boring part of farming for money is that at level 30 the drop is
poor and if your using greens (for speed and not dying) your skill
will not increase and I have given this up and just going for level
now - but still using the gear I quested at lvl 15.
