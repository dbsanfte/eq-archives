I really think you made the right decision. Without going into too much
detail, I was in a similar situation with my guild some time ago. They
had revamped their goals, and (to put it mildly) their play style no
longer meshed with my play style. However, since I had been with them
for some time, and had had a lot of fun and made a number of friends, I
decided to stick it out. Long story short, I ended up having a horrible
time and eventually left the guild feeling very burned. So much so that
I have yet to join another guild, because the last one left me with such
bad experiences. In retrospect, I really wish I'd left them much
earlier, when it became apparent that thay were no longer the type of
guild I wanted to be a part of.
