I did an experiment, if I try to get myself to the very edge of the vendor
area I crash to the desktop all the time. If I go back against the wall I
don't. When I look at the character with a second account the character is
not where I see them while running them (example Joe Trader thinks he is at
edge, Mike Buyer thinks he is off the platform) there are some funky bugs in
the bazaar.
I will just stand back against the wall in the back vendor areas where
people can find me..........
