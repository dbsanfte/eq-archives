If I had been programming it, I'd have retained the old "model
choice", and ADDED a new database field for choosing a Luclin
face independently.

They had to add scores of new fields for all the possible Luclin
factions, what's one more for the "Luclin face" instead of
trying to "share" the old face-pick field?

And while we're on the subject, Verant keeps mumbling about
"locking down" the "Facepick" option after a while.  I think
this would suck.  IRL, people enjoy changing their hairstyles,
hair color, eye color (via contacts), beard style if applicable,
etc. etc, in order to add some fun variety from time to time.
What sense does it make to lock the door on that same sort
of enjoyment in EQ?  If people want to stay looking the same,
they can, but if they want to fiddle with their appearance
sometime down the road, what's the harm?

I'd like to keep the option to have my characters' hair fade
gradually to white as they get "older", for example.
