Castersrealm is now reporting the following as clarification
for the change yesterday:

The new version will have the same loot table that it had
before.  This is to encourage friends to help since they'll
have something to gain.   Obviously the developers feel
that having a friend with a click-stick isn't enough for some
people.

The new version drops a heart that is NO DROP (as expected)
but is not NO RENT (as hoped.)   The encounter can now be
done at any point in the quest instead of as the final encounter.

And there is no "triggered" spawn, BTW.  The only version is the
random spawn.  They -- by admission - got rid of "their" problem:
people jumping on a spawn they didn't trigger themselves.  You
can't do that if the spawn is still triggered.

It just got a lot harder for smaller guilds to equip their clerics
with their epics, IMO.   I can't wait to see what the druids and
wizards who hunt in Skyfire are going to think of having a guild
(or two or three) in there pulling everything in sight while they
wait for the spawn, either.

I guess that's the bright spot:  Skyfire is probably a lot safer
right now than it's ever been...
