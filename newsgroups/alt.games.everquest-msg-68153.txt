It depends on how much you split the functions. I dont see any real reason
to do the level of split where they have a bind for CRs and a bind for
gates etc as many of the casters have a real problem getting back to a
corpse as they are so much more fragile.

Well I wasnt fixing the location specifically that was just a first
idea...essentially in the city zone so anyone who can get in can use, or
has to get a caster to specifically do a bind in a more useful place...ie
Mr SK there has to bind in the catacombs OR cough up to a mage to bind him
near the QH zone line away from unfriendly guards.
