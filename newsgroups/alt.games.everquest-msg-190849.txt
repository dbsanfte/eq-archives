Zone into the Qeynos hills, and follow the road to Surefall Glade.
At the entrance of Surefall Glade, go right next to the mountian range, and 
stay clear of the undead ruines there. very soon you'll see a huge gwolf 
like cave-entrance, which is the entrance to Black Burrow. 

And yes, level 5 is a nice level to start hunting around in AND at the 
outside of Black Burrow.

Check http://www.eqatlas.com for the exact location and/or shortcuts to the 
Black Burrow dungeon.

Its a three minute run from Qeynos Gates ;)
