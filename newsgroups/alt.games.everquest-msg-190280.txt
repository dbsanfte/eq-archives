What a load of crap. Yantis has so much plat on servers from buying it
as well as having characters who make it. Once you get a lot of plat,
you can buy low sell high to get a lot more. Anyone could have as much
real life money, or as much plat, from doing the exact same thing. A
lot of us just want to play a roleplaying GAME instead.

Its not corrupt GMS. Its just the will to do the WORK to have it.
