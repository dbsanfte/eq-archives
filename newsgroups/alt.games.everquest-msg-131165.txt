Not sure where you're getting the expected stats information, but I
think it's wrong.

Xanthe's Earring of Nature has the following stats:
AC 5, STR 8, STA 8, WIS 10, HP 55, Mana 55, SvFire/cold/magic 7

Earring of the Solstice has the following stats:
AC 5, STA 5, WIS 8, INT 8, HP 55, Mana 55, SvFire/cold/magic 5

In other words, the INT didn't drop from 10 to 8 - it always was 8.
