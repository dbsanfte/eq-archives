I get it but what is an evil *roleplayer* doing in a guild full of goods and
nuetrals?  And if they are more concerned with being in a good guild than
roleplaying, wtf are they doing on FV?  Actually I think I know the answer;
new server = new chance to be more UBER than the general populace.  Which
still doesn't belong on a "roleplaying preferred" server.

As for that, when I roleplayed an evil troll the only thing I needed to say
to goodie humans was "/rude."  Why, if I'm roleplaying, do I want to learn a
brand new (even other evils) language in minutes?  When I played there it
was to roleplay, not to power level, farm loot, join an uber guild or raid
the planes.  There are a couple of dozen servers where language and
alignment are not an issue, so unless the majority of players was crying out
for this change ( I admit I have no idea) everyone who didn't like it
shoulda moved out.
