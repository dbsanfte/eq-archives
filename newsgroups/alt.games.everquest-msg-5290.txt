Last I heard, Jboots can be multiquested and therfore can be sold, sort of.
If someone had the ring off the Ancient Cyclops and turned it in, then you
immediatly turned in the gold and whatever else, you would get the boots. I
wouldn't pay more than 8k for someone to do this. Ancient is not all that
rare and not a very high level.
