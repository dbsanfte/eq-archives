If you havnt done so already, try having a play around with datarate.txt (in
your everquest folder)
I believe standard is 4.5 or so, so try raising/lowering it and see if it
helps. (probably lowering)
If that doesnt work, download a copy of drTCP and set your tcp parameters.

These are the parameters I use:
TCP receive window: 46720
Window scaling:no
Time stamping:yes
Selective acks:yes
PathMTU discovery:yes
Black hole detection:yes
max duplicate acks:2
    (Im running winme)
TTL:64
MTU:1500

Hope this helps.
