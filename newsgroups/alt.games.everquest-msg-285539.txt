So, I've been playing EQ for years, but since they keep changing the 
setup, that doesn't give me a very firm basis for answering this 
question.  I hear some people run different UI or log parsers that can 
give them more definitive answers, so maybe you can help me out.

My understanding is that exp currently works in different ways depending 
on whether you are grouped, in a raid, using pets, using charmed pets, 
using DS, and perhaps even using FD, but also whether you are going for 
AA exp or "real" exp, your ZEM and Hot Zone status and then there are 
leadership exp and raid leadership exp to consider (although on the 
Combine and Sleeper servers, these two are not yet in the game)

Here's how I think its currently working

Real exp is based on your level vs level of mob, multiplied by the Zone 
Experience Modifier and by the Hot Zone bonus if you happen to be in a 
Hot Zone.

AA experience is based strictly on your level vs level of mob, no ZEM or 
Hot Zone factored in.

With real exp, you need a certain amount per level, each level requiring 
more points than the one before, in a more or less smooth curve, except 
that level 60 is much smaller than the levels before or after.  Getting 
actual numbers for all levels would be very interesting, though.

With AA exp, I believe you currently need an amount of exp similar to a 
fixed percent of your level; 20% is one number I've seen bandied about.
======================================================================
If this is correct, lets try an experiment to see what this means:
Three characters in a group, each has just dinged 51 on his last kill; A 
has full "real" exp on, B has 100% AA set, and C has the bar at 50%.

100 kills later, A hits 52, B dings his fifth AA, and C is halfway thru 
his 3rd AA and halfway to 52.

Meanwhile, same zone (killing much higher level mobs) a similar group of 
level 64's, D at 0%, E at 100%, and F at 50%

100 kills later, D hits 65, E dings his fifth AA, and F is halfway thru 
his 3rd AA and halfway to 65.

This would be a departure from previous AA setup, where the E and F 
would get radically different AA than B and C.
======================================================================

Both kinds of exp are modified by the number of people in your group;
formula is (I think) [xp * {1 + <20% * (number of people in your group 
over 1)>}/number of people in your group]

(note this supplants a former setup which used different numbers for 
each group size, and was arranged so that the 6th member was "free")

Raid exp is a complete mystery to me, but the basic observation is that 
your "real" exp bar will hardly move at all, perhaps enough to offset a 
death or two where you've recieved a 96% rez, but that on AA exp, your 
bar will move at a decent, although hardly exciting, rate.

Leadership AA is simpler, assuming you are leader of a group (how many 
people minimum?) you can elect to recieve 20% less exp, and your 
leadership exp bar will move... but at what rate, and what factors 
contribute, I don't know.  I recall thinking it moved faster as I 
leveled up, as though perhaps leadership points were fixed in 
difficulty.  But even if this was true, is it still true after recent 
changes?

Raid leadership, I guess similar to Leadership, but you have to be 
leading a raid to get it.  Hopefully, its also similar to AA on a raid, 
as opposed to Real exp on a raid, because otherwise nobody would ever 
get a single point to spend on raid abilities.

Quest reward exp, I believe this is a raw number of exp points, 
unmodified by any factor whatsoever, except that if you are getting 
group exp, and you are too low to receive any exp in  your group, you 
get no exp at all.

I believe pets currently alter the exp formula only if only a single pet 
damages the target mob, and no PC hurts the mob at all, in which case 
exp is halved.  Do any damage at all, even from someone else's pet, to 
the mob, and full exp is generated.

I believe charmed pets, however, must be outdamaged in order to not lose 
half your exp.
==============Who gets the xp=========================================
The person or group or raid who does the most damage killing a mob gets 
all the exp for that mob.

Damage for this includes damage done by pets and charmed pets, but does 
NOT include damage done by a damage shield, no matter who cast it or who 
it is on.  If no damage is done to a mob other than damage shield, then 
nobody gets the exp; a single point is sufficient for full credit. 
However, if two ungrouped people, A and B, both do a very small amount 
of damage to a mob which is otherwise killed by DS, if person A does 1 
point and person B does 2 points, person B will get the kill credit.

Damage done by mobs which are niether pets nor charmed is also 
unattributed, just as DS damage is, however if such a mob get the "kill 
shot" then nobody gets any exp for the kill.

Kill shot damage; full damage for the killing blow is counted in the 
formula to determine who gets kill credit; if person A does 99 damage to 
a mob which has 100 points, and then person B hits the mob with a 100 
point blow or nuke, then person B gets kill credit, even though only 1 
more point of damage would have been needed to kill the mob.

If a person zones out or dies, then damage done by him does not count 
twoards the kill credit formula.

I don't know if that applies if a person in a group zones out or dies; 
does his damage still count as part of his group's damage?  Say we have 
group AB, and soloer C. A does 50 points and then dies, B does 24 
points, and C does 26 points, killing the mob.  Does B get the exp for 
the kill, since group AB has done 74/100?  Or does C get the exp, having 
done 26/50?  What if A zones back in before the kill?

I don't believe FD affects the exp formula, damage done by a person who 
goes FD still counts in full.  However, it is interesting to note that 
if a person is FD when a mob dies, he will recieve no faction hits, 
positive or negative, for the kill.

======================================================================

Speaking of faction hits, in general, all people who have done damage to 
a mob, or healed someone who is on the aggro list for the mob, or have 
gotten on the aggro list of a mob by other means, get full faction hits, 
positive and negative, when the mob dies.  However, only the person 
completing a quest or quest step get the faction hits for doing that 
quest, even though people grouped with him may recieve exp for the 
completion.  Faction hits are also completely independant of level, of 
raid status, of anything else, they are fixed in size and the amount of 
faction needed for each faction status is fixed in size; this is 
completely at odds with the various exp systems.

LDoN points are awarded based on your level and the difficulty of the 
LDoN you complete, which in turn is based on the average level of your 
party when you pull the mission (and whether Normal or Hard is 
picked)... although there is some suggestion that difficulty is actually 
based on the level of the first person to zone in to the LDoN.

Shroud missions, which let you essentially play a different character of 
  likely a different level, I'm not at all sure how this works, but I 
believe you can get some exp on your real character from completing 
these missions; whether real or AA and how that factors, I have no idea. 
  These are not currently available on Combine, and I only did a couple 
on  my 66 mage on the FV server and wasn't looking at my XP or AA bars 
at the time.
