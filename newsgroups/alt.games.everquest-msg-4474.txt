See the thing about the pathological liar is that he can't tell the
difference between his lies and the truth.  No matter how many times its
clearly shown what his intent was he still protests that he is
innocent.  This one is able to contradict himself in his own posts,
admitting to being a lying troll in one sentence, denying it the next. 
Such internal conflict does not lead to joy.  

As is so often the case the victor is left feeling sorry for his
defeated foe, realizing just how unfair the engagement was.  I have
taken a personal vow to react with the deserved pity rather than anger, 
not just to this lying troll, but to all of them.  Such a sad way to
spend the days they will never see again, far better to seek out joy.
