My thought on that was "uber" guilds are mostly full time players who don't:
work, have lives, wives, kids, or any other social environment, and
therefore could go to the store at 9am in the morning and grab the first
copies.  Now i know some people that did get PooP  err i mean PoP yesterday
and are not in an Uber Guild, but they just happened to have the day off :p
