I think EQ needs more trapped places and locks to pick. How about a
spell component for KEI that can only be found  in locked chests?
lol...ever seen a rogue get begged by a newb for anything other than
plat or items. Groups would be way more careful charging into a
dungeon if the place were trapped with stuff that would kill you
otherwise. Also, make some valuable no-drop stuff that can only be
aquired via pickpocket. thats all, we just need some stuff to make
rogues valuable in the D&D tradition of what they do.
