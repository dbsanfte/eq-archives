1 handers

Crystal Spider Fang 10/22 piercer about 2k
Black Blade of Tormentind 9/22 (proc torment that, although is only the same
as Bloodclaw 20 dd 30 dot it also has a blind effect...which has the effect
of really pissing the mob off, great taunt) downside is it weighs 10 cost
about 1k
Centi Short Sword 12/25 +5sta +5str about 1k
Centi Long Sword 14/27 +8sta +8str about 3k but often seen for a lot less
(don't see those stats and think it's better than your lammy, run it thru
copelands...it isn't at your level, is better off hand than a lammy tho)

In my experience if I want to do damage I use 2hdr, you can pick some nice
ones up for under 6k nowadays. Felhammer, you could pick up for 3k. There
are plenty of 30/40 2hders in that mark. The Sarnak Toffee Hammer is warrior
only 30/40 and under 1k very often. Truncheon of Doom 33/44 proc Tepid Deeds
(slows mob attacks) and Bobs axe 33/44 2hs proc 149dd is not far off 6k
neither is Zealots Incarnadine Sword 26/35 procs a lifetap of about 100pnts
is also well under the 10k mark now. What these are no good for is holding
taunt, when felhammer goes on a proc'ing spree, as it does, then I will have
aggro if I want it or not and same must be said for the ToD, Bobs Axe and
Zealots but this isn't a guarantee and you really want 1hders for the taunt
factor when you are main tank in the group.

What you have as 1hders sound ok to me and for group work these will do you
fine. If you partner a healer (as I do) and want to drop mobs quicker go for
a two hander, I drop mobs faster, losing less health (and mana) with
Felhammer than I do with a Lammy and a Centi.
