Dragon Lady
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

( - D. Roeser - B. Blotto - )

Out of the smoke of the dawn of man
Out of the ocean across the sand
Reaching forth with an ancient hand
Dragon lady

Out of the flames of a man's desire
A hair raising voice from an evil choir
Raining down like a freezing fire
Dragon lady

She appears mysteriously
You don't take her seriously
Until you're under her spell

Chorus: Dragon lady takes you by the heart
Dragon lady takes you by the heart
You try to run but before you start
Dragon lady's got you by the heart
Dragon lady takes you by the heart
Dragon lady's got you she won't let go

Eternal lightning flashes across the sky
When the dragon lady shows you how to fly
Eternal lightning flashes across the sky
When the dragon lady shows you how to fly

Out of the cage in the center ring
Out of the crowd and straight to the king
Who's out of his mind with a mystical thing
Dragon lady

Out of the dream and into the night
A final look makes you die of fright
No one there in the candlelight
Dragon lady

She appears outragiously
You take her courageously
Until you're under her spell

Chorus:

Eternal lightning flashes across the sky
When the dragon lady shows you how to fly
Eternal lightning flashes across the sky
And the Dragon Lady's laughing as you cry...
