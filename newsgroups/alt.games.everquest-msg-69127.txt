"Green"  covers a very large area.   At level 58, a level 20 Goblin Soothsayer
with 400 hp is green to me.  Has been for a good 25 levels.  These I can mow
down 10 at a time.  However, a level 40 Frost Giant Bezerker is also green to
me.  He has what, 5000 hp? and has been green for 1 level.  Two of these would
hand me my ass on a platter.  One of them could possibly give me a run for my
money.   Or at least could have.   I tend to kill them pretty well now, since
my gear has come quite a ways since 52.
