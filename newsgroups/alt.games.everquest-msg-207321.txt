As often as I can, which so far hasn't been too often.  My longest CR
to date took was 4-1/2 days IRL (to EK when I was a total newb 4 years
ago :-p).

Probably, at least in terms of what you appear to mean by "where CR
actually matters".  That doesn't change my opinion.  I've spent a
day waiting for help to recover a corpse from the Hole.  I've spent
days doing mostly CRs for myself and others.  It's part of the game,
and IMO it makes the days where you successfully avoid the impending
CR from hell that much better.  IRL, I prefer most challenges to be
minimized, I don't want to have to sweat over putting food on the
table or clothes on my family's backs or a roof over our heads.  In
my recreation, OTOH, I usually prefer some sort of challenge that has
a meaningful penalty associated with failure (hunting and fishing are
mostly boring, though the scenery is nice, whitewater canoing is lots
of fun, to give a few examples).  When the pinnacle of "the EQ
experience" became "uh oh, better be careful, if we wipe we'll have
to sit around sipping our iced tea for 10 minutes before we can get
our 96% rezzes at the graveyard" the game was cheapened.  And I sure
as hell wouldn't want to see them cheapen it any further.  That's
every bit as stupid as what I hear of high-end Luclin zones where you
get to clear uninteresting mobs for hours on end in hopes that you
won't all die of boredom before you reach the boss, it's just stupid
in a different way.
