It means if at 100 DEX, you proc 100 times over a period of time, with
200+ DEX, you will proc a whopping 102 times over the same period of
time.

Yes, it's that useless.

Basically, VI is talking outta their asses when they claim these stats
are meaningful.  Only STA since it has a direct and linear relation to
hitpoints (which is meaningful) is a useful stat.  Everything else can
be set to some value above the "penalty" level (usually 75) and
forgotten.
