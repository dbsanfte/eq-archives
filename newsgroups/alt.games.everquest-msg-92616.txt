I love that zone. I have brought up a bunch of alts there, usually I
run them in to that zone by sneak/tp and it's good to 10th level. One
wizard I had there tried to do a shadow step kiting (Dont try that at
home!). Nuke a mob and shadow step, nuke again and step, I made a real
big train, but no prob, lots of shortie deputies around to clean up
the mess.
