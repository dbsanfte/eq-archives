The OP didn't say it, I did.  As you can see by the quote above.

OP came close though, when he asked "Unless of course
there is more content in the form of spells, items, etc that can be used
now."  I thought it interesting to note that there -are- such things, 
but you can't get them without going on LDoN missions, which seemed to 
be something the OP was interested in generally; he was only level 20 
and thought he might not be able to go, which is reasonable considering 
that SOV, LOY and POP failed to have combat content for people of that 
level.

Yes, at 20 he -can- go on LDoN missions, but if he couldn't, No, there 
wouldn't be anything really of interest added by getting it.

THere are good things about LDoN, but as I pointed out, they only come 
from doing LDoN missions.

I took the list apart point by point, I did not solely attack the magus 
comment.  A) things that you only get if you go on LDoN missions  B) 
magus system.

So no, I did not take it out of context, I took it as the exception to 
the A) case, but then attempted to show that it isn't a particularly 
meaningful exception.

I don't expect them to either, but I was trying to comment that this is 
one of the ones that doesn't.  And you basically agree with me, and I 
dont' think either of us have any problem with that.

I'll tell you my dream; that they Degrade the transportation system.

Remember SOV, where you had to actually go, on foot, to each ring (save 
for Iceclad) and pick up a "tooth" groundspawn, before you could be 
ported there?  I think every single transportation system in the game 
should be like that.  Every destination, you should have to get a flag 
or a keyring item of some kind by making the trip yourself just the once.

The problem with this idea for SOV was that it was pre keyring, and that 
meant the tooth was eating a valuable slot in your inventory.  You only 
needed one (the WL one would work for WL and GD, the CS one for all 
three) but even so, an item that did nothing but enable port to one, 
two, or three locations, that was a pain to carry around.  Now that they 
have flags and keyrings, though, I don't see the problem.  Are there a 
hundred port destinations in the game (between druid, wizard, Nexus, TD 
[hey, I forgot about TD, my bard used to use that constantly!], POP and 
Magus)?  And many of those go to the same zones, I'd be happy enough 
with one flag per zone.  A list so I could see which zones I'm flagged 
for would be in order, I despise the plan in POP where you have to go 
ask someone to unlock your memories or something if you can't remember 
what flags you have on each character.

Lets see, what else could they add?  Ah, of course, they have 
Soulbinders, they could add Wayhomers, NPC's you ask to gate you to bind.
