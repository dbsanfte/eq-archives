I installed from the ruins of kunark expansion, and althouth the
readme file AND the manual both state that there is a tutorial for me
to run through, it remains to be found.  I checked the folders, did a
file search, checked the cd, and even asked a gm, to no avail.  Am I
to infer that the tutorial was left off of the cd for ruins of kunark,
despite all the info on it in the manual?
