It's not the multilation that makes it a copyright violation.  It's the fact 
that I've appropriated someone else's creative work, used it in something I 
produced, but didn't contribute enough creativity into the work I've created 
to transform the thing beyond being a display of original author's book.

Actually, it's similar to a derivative work, and the display of it would 
fall under "distribution".  But again, what I'm pointing out is that nothing 
needs to be copied in order for a copyright violation to occur.

But a book isn't an animated movie.  I've not copied anything directly, and 
what I have copied is intangible.  Again, I was responding to the notion 
that you have brought up more than once that copying needs to occur in order 
for there to be a copyright violation.

Never said it was.  I was merely pointing out two examples of clear 
copyright violations without anything being explicitly copied by the 
violator.

It doesn't matter.  Applicable case law is every bit as controlling as 
legislation, at least in the United States, provided the two do not 
explicitly contradict one another.

Well, if you want to argue semantics, I suppose you could claim that 
intellectual property misappropriation is entirely separate from a copyright 
violation, but that doesn't really matter.  If IGE can get nailed on IP 
misappropriation, just because it's not a technical "copyright violation" in 
your eyes, IGE's situation isn't helped any.   Call it however you want, but 
I believe looking at the holdings of those cases I cited that SOE could very 
easily nail IGE.

I first simply responded to point out that your conception of copyright law 
is too narrow, and that it extends beyond simply the right to copy.  I mean, 
hell, the right of publicity is considered a part of copyright law, and that 
doesn't even involve an original creative work at all, much less the copying 
of one.  (The right of publicity is the right to control the commercial 
value and exploitation of your name, appearance, etc.)
