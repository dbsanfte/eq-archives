  This whole thread seems to bee taking a negative
view of spouses and EQ.  Allow me to tell my 
Spouse/EQ story (briefly) so you all can get the
warm fuzzies about it.
   Married happily for 14 years, to a man I both
love and like.  He gets to spend the next two years
living in Washington state, while I live in San 
Diego (next to Verant!) tending to the house we 
bought in this incredibly messed up real estate
market (tip:  if you can get San Diego real estate
for a reasonable price before the market skyrockets,
do it).  Two years living apart.  We talk on the
phone everyday, of course, but never see each other
save for every six months or so.
   Except in Norrath, where we see each other
every day.  Running around, having adventures,
helping each other out, and just in general hanging
out and having fun.
   Is Everquest damaging my marriage any?  Hell,
EQ is one of the main supports of my marriage 
right now.

            allow virtual sex, and everything will
            be perfect.
