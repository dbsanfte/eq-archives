Yeah, the latest subscriber figures for MMOGs don't show EQ2 doing well 
relative to expectations or the competition. It's a shame because despite 
the many problems the game does have, it still provides me and my wife a far 
better gaming experience than any of the other competitive products we've 
played. What it comes down to in the end, imo, is that SOE is just a bunch 
of boneheads who can't do this right. They were lucky to have Brad and 
Verant around to create their only real hit, and they've done just about 
everything imaginable to hurt the success of the games they've done since 
(this SOE Exchange thing is just mind boggling and will go down in history 
as one of their dumbest ideas to date).

The poll was stupid and insulting. I voted NO on all three of my accounts 
but frankly wasn't surprised to see the announced results. What annoyed me 
most was the positioning of the figures. The results actually showed about 
an even distribution of players between NO, YES, and DONT CARE. This type of 
data really illutrates how easy it is to lie with statistics. From these 
results SOE claims that "most players" are either infavor of SOE Exchange or 
aren't bothered by it. I look at the same data and see that "most players" 
aren't asking for it. I have a feeling that no matter how the numbers came 
out, SOE would have taken the position that it supported their plan. 
Surprise, surprise.

I'm still enjoying EQ2 quite a bit and have built a very fun and active 
community there with friends. This will continue for some time, but this too 
shall pass and a time will come when I'm ready to move on to the next mmog. 
Right now I've got my eye focused most sharply on Vanguard from Sigil. Both 
the credentials and the marketing muscle seem to be there, but note that we 
said the same thing about Star Wars Galaxies, and look what happened there. 
The difference this time around, I submit, is that you've got two entities 
who actually have a CLUE. Brad McQuaid and team and Microsoft. If these guys 
fail to give us something good, we should all just uninstall all our games 
from our computers and go out and buy consoles and martial arts games.
