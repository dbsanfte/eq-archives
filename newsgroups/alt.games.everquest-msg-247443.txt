/sigh

That assumes *he* did the bannable offense.

I'm not remotely sure where that came from. I can be accused of a lot of 
things... but making one post and never returning isn't one of them.

I thought it was pretty obvious. The innocents who get f****d by this 
policy.

> Use a little common sense.

Common sense dictates innocent people *will* be impacted by this policy. 
Common sense dictates that not *Everyone* feels the need to scream blue 
murder on the 'boards...when they've been injusticed.

He plays a different game now, if SOE wants to ban him for no reason, 
and then treat him like crap, then he doesn't really want to play their 
game. Me, I don't blame him.

As an aside, I'm sure I could have dozens of EQ account user names and 
passwords without trying that hard within a few weeks, without having 
anyone intend to give them to me. Not... specific people mind you... but 
usable accounts nonetheless. The mere ignorance, fallibility, and 
'trustliness' (what the heck is the word for that??) of normal average 
people shouldn't be a bannable offense.
