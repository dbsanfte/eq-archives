This reminds me of a funny thing that happened to me a few times while
pulling for a northwall group in the Dreadlands (only one with Jboots and
now sowers).
I would run out, tag a mob and run back to my group.  When I would get back,
I would hit "evade" to drop aggro and switch the mob to the Tank.
Sometimes, however, the mob would turn around and run to a nearby group if
that groups puller had pulled his mob near ours on his way back to his
group.  Kind of funny to see it happen but also a good illustration of aggro
management.
