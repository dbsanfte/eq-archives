Last night I was soloing giants in FM, throroughly enjoying the KEI I
had paid good plat for, when, as always happens when I least expect
it, I snared myself. Luckily, the mob didn't notice me throwing myself
into a sitting position and frantically rifling through the ol'
spellbook to find Cancel Magic. I was in a pretty precarious position
sitting snared *inside* the walls of the giant fort.

Anyway, the snare had taken the top spot, thanks to the fact that I
had not paid attention and let my skin like steel drop. I was
terrified that I was about to watch my KEI go away - I wasn't sure
which buff CM would hit first - but I figured confirmation on how it
actually worked would be worth it in the worst case here. I cast
cancel magic on myself and, much to my delight, the snare went away,
leaving the top spot open once again.

The KEI was easily the oldest buff I had on, but happened to be in the
second spot. I will now *always* throw a couple of junk buffs on
before getting KEI.
