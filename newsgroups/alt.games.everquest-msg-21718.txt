1:  if you can affoard it, upgrade the CPU/mobo/case first.  Your
system can only run as fast as the processor will allow it, and
running a top of the line vidcard would simply be a waste.

2:  The cheapest and most effective upgrade you can ever do is to
increase your RAM.  Luckily, RAM is dirt cheap nowadays.  If I were
you, I'd look into at least 256 megs, maybe even 512 if you can pull
it off.  Prices simply can't be this cheap for much longer.
