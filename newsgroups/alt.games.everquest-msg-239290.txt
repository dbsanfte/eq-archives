Join In The Activities
EverQuest Celebrates Five Years. Join us for the 5th Anniversary in-game 
celebrations for EverQuest. Starting next week, and over the course of 
the next few weeks, you will be able to join in a massive scavenger 
hunt, battle fabled NPCs, experience enormous firework displays and 
defend your city against armies of skeletons.

Scavenger Hunt: What will be the prize?

Fabled NPCs: They're back! They're buff! Are you ready?

Fireworks display: Lighting up the sky in celebration!

Skeletons Marching: They're marching, and they are angry!
