yeah, fishbone is off hadden in front of the hut with the warrior guy
near Rephas at a pond by surefall. Hadden spawns roughly every 6 hours
or so. This is what you do:

You bind across from hadden (or where he would be) then you check
every so often. If you come and see someone killing hadden, you know
he will be up in about 6 hours again. I've killed him a couple times
with no one else around and got fishbone at least twice, which I sold.

Funny and sad sight.. Pyzin was up on FV a couple days after it was
live when my barb shamaness was in Qey hills. Of course no one was
high enough to kill her at that time (who was anywhere around anyway)
and she was killing some newbs ( well really we were all newbs ;  ) )
and chasing people around and I think someone ran her to the guards
who killed her. I'm 55th level and had various other characters on
diff servers and have never seen her once so that was kind of fun.
