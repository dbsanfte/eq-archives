  It's possible that these /reports are timestamped (they ought to be, at
least).  If so, you can report both the initial aggro and the kill, and that
should serve as proof of KSing at least against special spawns.  If it's a
named mob that spawns every 30 minutes at minimum, you get aggro at 1:32 pm,
and the mob dies and someone else gets the exp at 1:38 pm, that's pretty
solid proof you were KSed.

  It's all a matter of how you use it.  More people should be aware of what
a powerful tool /report can be if you keep your wits about you during and
after the incident.
