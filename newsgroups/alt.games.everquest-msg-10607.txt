So if your group mezzes 2 mobs whilst fighting another, the 2 mezzed
ones are freely available, because they haven't been engaged yet? What
a crock of shite. It is whether they have *agroed* not whether they
have taken any physical damage.

Any puller will be able to tell you that they have engaged one mob
amongst a cluster, with the sole intention of pulling all of them
because he has a chanter back at the group ready for crowd control.
He will only have engaged 1 mob, but because the others are within
agro range, he has all of them... taking one from him as he runs back
to his group is KSing. The only exception to this would be if he
trained you and one or more agroed you. THEN you have the right to
take the mob.... in self-defence, if nothing else.
