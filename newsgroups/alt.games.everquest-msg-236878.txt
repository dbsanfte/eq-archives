These were in little flip book pamphlets put out in the 80's and early 
90's when that one kid commited suicide and his mother thought it was 
because of a gigantic Satanic cult that put curses on people so when 
their D&D character died the player died too. I actually have the little 
flip book because my aunt is all anti-D&D and into that bullshit. So i 
play D&D at her house all the time :P
