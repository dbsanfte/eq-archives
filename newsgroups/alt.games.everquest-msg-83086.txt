Just one suggestion:

Lord/Magi/Hand or Frenzy spawns of Lower Guk.  Many Paladins are still
soloing these areas at level 56, so exp should be OK.  Being an undead
dungeon it caters for both Paladins and Clerics very well.  Downside is it
can be popular at times.  As for crowd control the Paladin should have no
troubles taking on two or three at once with you healing.  I at 47 can solo
one of those mobs easily.  Just remember to root towards end of fight
though, they will run.
