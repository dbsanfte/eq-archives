IIRC, I think it was the one who orignally set this thing off.  Granted, I
don't change tracks well, so I may have railroaded right through the

out, like Arafat saying that the Palestinians would have Jewish women for
their slaves.

I wonder why only certain people have a right not to be offended.

Responding to an attack on the people with an attack on their governments.
