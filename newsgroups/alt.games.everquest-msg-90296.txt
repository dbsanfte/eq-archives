There are lots of post-50 outdoor zones.  Lots.  Zones like
DL/OT are convienent because they are near major travel
hubs/banks/bind points.  I know you personally can't access
Luclin, but Maiden's Eye is like DL on the Moon for this same
reason (sure, you have to zone a couple of times, but by the time
you're ready for ME nothing in Nexus/Netherbian/DS is going
to bother you much on the way there, and it's a SHORT run.

AoE groups have such a small impact on 99.9% of the folks
on all servers it's laughable.  Most classes can't AoE.  My
rogue will NEVER get into an AoE group.  That still doesn't
mean I haven't just sat near one going because it's just so
f'ing impressive when done well.  I applaud the folks that
can do it.  I wish I could, but AoE double-backstabs don't
appear in my AA list...

Two friends and I were in the basement in Karnors.  Rogue, monk,
cleric.  No enchanter/shaman/bard/evac/etc.  We did just fine
using Ghetto mezzing and lots of damage.  We would NOT be
the ultimate dragon-raid team, because "Nimble" doesn't help
as much against quad-520 hits as "Defensive."  We do great just
grinding exp.  Exp grinding /= raid situations.

Reliance on Warriors for tanking, cleric for healing, enchanters
for CC, and rogues for damage is not something you have to
have in every group every day.  Heck, 3 rogues and a shaman
mowed through Droga at levels 32 through 34.  With no "real"
healer or CC person.  Everyday groups don't have to be perfect,
they just have to keep you alive and have some fun.
