Answer is...you CAN'T tell ahead of time.  After smoking most things I come
across, I have to be in a group around Aviaks in order to amount to a hill
of beans.  Even then sometimes I don't.  Hell, this morning we had a full
group by the chicken coop in SK.  We pulled some tough baddies, but then we
pulled one particular Avocet that simply could not be hit with magic.  He
slaughtered all us casters and our *sniff* pets, too.  He wouldn't even
touch the tanks until us finger-wigglers were taken care of.  We were all
levels 20 through 25.

Oh well...off to get my corpse in SK.  ACK!!!
