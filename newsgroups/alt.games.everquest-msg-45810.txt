Ok, Mr braindead...  30 seconds until it senses you are LD.  You can still
get killed that way by pulling the plug.  The code was changed for the PvP
players because it could easily take far longer than that for 2 players to
duel it out and, if one got in trouble, they did just what you are
describing so, instead of putting it only on the PvP servers, it was put on
all the servers.

just put the old code back for the 'blue' servers and let the PvP folks deal
with the grief because they have the need for it (can't have your neighbor
getting away alive after all)...

"ain't gonna happen"...  Nope.  you are right.  why should VI put the code
back if people don't care...  After all, they make their money from you
being on-line and regaining exp from dieing puts you on line that much
longer..  Then again, 'twinking' was officially cheating back then too...
The other week, the logon message was about being careful on transfering
equipment between characters incase you lose it so things do change if
people insist on that...
