I've been sitting back for a while now and watching everybody in this
newsgroup screaming on both sides of the EULA argument (yes, it's
enforceable / no, it ain't).  And all this time I've been waiting patiently
for someone to point out a little fact from US law, namely the Uniform
Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA).

Well, now it's being used.  Congratulations.

You lot REALLY need to read:

http://www.badsoftware.com/uccindex.htm

You also might want to look at the actual document (took a while to find
it):

http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/ulc/ucita/ucita01.htm

Read the following sections especially:

SECTION 206. OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE: ELECTRONIC AGENTS
SECTION 209. MASS-MARKET LICENSE



Items of note:

Regarding selling / giving away your account, there may be something in
UCITA to our benefit:

SECTION 503. TRANSFER OF CONTRACTUAL INTEREST
(4) A term that prohibits transfer of a contractual interest under a
mass-market license by the licensee must be conspicuous.
7. Mass Market Licenses. Subsection (c) provides that a term prohibiting
transfer of a mass market license must be conspicuous. This refers to terms
that prohibit transfer. It does not refer to terms that control the scope of
use under the license or to whom warranties or other obligations extend.
(14) "Conspicuous", with reference to a term, means so written, displayed,
or presented that a reasonable person against which it is to operate ought
to have noticed it.

Verant *is* allowed to disallow transfer of the software, but must make the
restriction "conspicuous".
