 Bards need to be especially cautious. Good advice is to not be friendly
and start up mana song or something unless you are out of Scion melee
range. For example, if I dispell Scion from out of range and then sit
down, if a bard comes up and hits me with ae song, they get added to
Scions hate list and get the crap beat out of them in no time.
