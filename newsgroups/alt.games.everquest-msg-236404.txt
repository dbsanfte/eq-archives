Some skills it doesn't matter if the mob is green or not. Disarm, Intimidate,
and Pick Pockets, I seem to recall, work that way. And I have seen the
*very* rare Off/Def/Weapon/Archery skillup against green mobs. Like a dozen
or so over the two years I've played, and never above level 20. But no,
don't pick on greens to improve your melee skills.

It *seems* to, for me. But I've never actually run a log parser to verify
it.
