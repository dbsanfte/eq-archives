Pre-50, magician.  Post-50 and particularly post-55, monk pulls ahead,
mainly because monks will continue to increase their power through equipment
upgrades while magicians peak at about 51 and then lose power in comparison
to "soloable" mobs.  Both can solo 1 to 60, though.

Add some healthy twinking into the mix and monk is better 1 to 60, but you
have to be up to the twinking-with-50k level to get that result.

>Items?

Melee classes always win the contest of "who has the cool items".  Monk, no
doubt.

>Quests?

Monks have 3 or 4 good quests.  Most of the low level monk quests stink in
the reward, but are actually pretty interesting quests.

Magicians have quite a few quests, most of which are pretty useful. 
Magicians win on the questing side by a huge margin.

>And Future?

Depends.  Monks and magicians both have a place in the high end game.  You
only *need* one of each, though.  Monk advantage is that beyond their
specialized skills they just simply put out good damage and so nobody
complains if you have 10 monks show up at a raid.  Any more than 4 magicians
show up at a raid and they start running out of things to do.  Clerics and
wizards can only eat so many mod rods before a mob dies.

>I hear mages past level 50 are weaker than they should be?

Yes, yes they are.  Soloing, their pets lose power considerably compared to
the mobs you have to fight for experience.  And magicians don't have the
"light-blue" option, since magicians don't get *any* experience off of
light-blues if their pet does more than half damage (and their pet *always*
does more than half damage or the magician is only fighting three or four
times an hour).  In higher end raids, it's worse.  Magicians can't land many
nukes, aren't allowed to have a pet usually, and so are relegated to a role
of CoH-elevator, mod-rod-creator, and damage-shielder.  Even better, in some
of the zones where CoH would be really handy, it's disabled.  Magicians are
the *only* class to have their main "class-defining" raid ability disabled
in multiple high level raid zones.


>If I group, it would probably only be with a wizard and monk friend I play
>with now.  Any Ideas?

For lower levels, whichever suits your fancy.  You don't sound like you're
aiming for the high end game yet, and pre-50 magicians are quite powerful,
as well as providing useful summoned items for the monk and for the whole
group.  If you have a set group and are going to be soloing otherwise, you
really can't go wrong with either.  Monks will always get into pickup groups
faster than magicians.
