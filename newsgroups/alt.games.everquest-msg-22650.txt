A small sewing kit.   Put two silks in, hit combine, one swatch
comes out.   Cost is a couple of gold or less, IIRC.   If you use
spider silks, you get silk swatches.  Spiderling silks make
threads.   (Two threads combined is a bandage; three is a
cord, but you need either a large sewing kit or to use a loom
to do that.)
