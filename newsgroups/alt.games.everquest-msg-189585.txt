    Wow, I've done most of my necromancer's career fear kiting. Let me think
back...

Level 16ish? 20ish? - fear kiting in The Warrens. Pull mobs to zone-in. Use
darkness to space out double pulls. Have pet tank first mob, with a few DoTs
to help. As soon as pet done with first mob, standard fear kite on the
second. Have to wait until higher level so the green trash near zone-in
doens't assist against the pet.

From around 20 to 24 - zone wall in Stonebrunt, across from zone-in and
halfway to where the boat is now. Once you're high enough you can even
single out of the kobold camps, and at lower levels you can kill the kitties
on the docks where the boat is now. The cats are a pain (run faster than
SoW, so still fairly swift when snared), and the snakes are a bigger pain
(nasty poison DoT), but are quite doable. Stuff stays near the wall for a
good time before pathing away from it.

Level 24 to low 30's: Marus Seru. Pull to the Sanctus Seru guards and you
have plenty of kite space. They will KS zelniaks and centipedes, but those
are usually annoyance mobs. I think I also did Trogs in Netherbian Lair in
the low 20's - pull to Dawnshroud zone, no adds unless trained, they are
Dubious so feigning to split if necessary is very easy. It's also great
feign pulling practice.

Level 33 to 40: zelniaks and wolves in Dawnshroud, wolves and frost giant
scouts in Great Divide. Dawnshroud, pull to the wall area beside Netherbian
zone and on the far side from the mushroom patch and you'll never get adds
unless trained. In GD, I'd pull to the single monolith near the wurm caves.
That can be an issue with the giants, though, as sometimes a coldain will
attack your mob and you need to time a nuke/'tap to win the kill.

40 to (I plan) 49 - plaguebone thieves in Dreadlands. I pull to one corner
of the combine compound, and they path to the far side - plenty of space,
and they're non-social anyways. At 41 I can almost keep the entire place
clear, and some of them were even to me at level 40. It's also fun to see
the level 50 players show up, hoping to get some XP, and have them watch as
someone 10 levels their junior kills faster than they can. ;-)

    I did that in Dawnshroud at level 33, before I got upgraded spells. Pull
to inside the Netherbian zone building, where the pathing is crazy, and run
around tapping and DoT'ing. It's fun, but you lose out on med time.
