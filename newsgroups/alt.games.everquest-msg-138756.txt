No offense Biz, but have you ever though of taking up Yoga? Then we can all
live with the bright hope of you accidently choking to death on your own
dick one fine sunny day. Of course I mean that in the nicest possible way
too : )

Oh - and I am already seeing a very good psychiatrist. He is good at
treating my chronic depression with some nifty medication: 225mg a day of
Effexor (Anti-depressant) and 1.25mg of Diazepam (Valium) every 4 hours
during the working day. Weeeeeeeeee.

Unfortunately I cannot return the favour and recommend anything for you Biz,
as I am unaware of any specialists or medication that specifically treats
chronic assholism...

Hmmn, actually something just came to me: I think maybe what your missing in
life is worthwhile goals so have grown bitter in your stasis. Have you ever
considered the worthy goal of attaining a Darwin Award? I do <really> hope
you still qualify as the thought of little Bizbees running around would be
enough for me to have to up my own medication.

Cheers
