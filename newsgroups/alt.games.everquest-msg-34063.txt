The one thing that's always frustrated me is the definition of "popular
fiction."  The name of my shaman, Beowulfe Grendelbane is a reference to
what I consider to be a fairly popular piece of fiction, while the name of
my warrior, Bercilak is a reference to a much more obscure fictional work.
I named my Shaman back in 1999, and have found that any attempt to get that
name on subsequent servers has been blocked by the naming filter.  I'm
waiting to lose that one, just figure they either haven't really noticed the
name as yet or work under some sort of grandfather clause.

I ran into a real frustration however in trying to start a guild.  At the
time that I wanted to start a guild with the name "Knights of the Round
Table" (admittedly, popular fiction) there were already 2 guilds on my
server that, IMHO contravened the naming policies.  The first of these was
the Knight Templars (that's how it's spelled), admittedly not from fiction,
though it is from real world history.  The second was Far Dareis Mai.  This
guild didn't even bother to find a similar misspelling, and was approved by
Verant despite the fact the name of the guild (an all female guild, natch ;)
was taken straight from Robert Jordan's "Wheel of Time" series.  I've found,
of course since then that either no one at Verant has read Robert Jordan or
the don't consider it to be popular fiction, because there are a myriad of
names taken from that series.  Ironically, the name we ended up with was
"The Einheriar" which we disbanded after a week because we found out there
was already an "Einherjar" on the server and we weren't allowed to change
the name.  You'd think they'd check to be sure that I wasn't trying to name
my guild similarly to another guild in order to spoil their rep . . . I
guess the next guild I start will have to be either "Fire of Heaven" or "Vis
Major."  =P
