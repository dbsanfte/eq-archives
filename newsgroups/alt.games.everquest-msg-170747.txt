While it's true that the mechanics don't particularly encourage
roleplaying, from my observations the role-players have no real
trouble at all with the mechanics.  Even the disjointed and
malleable backstory isn't a problem (different historical peoples
had different versions of shared myths, sometimes strikingly
different, this is not a difficault thing to accomodate).  Rather
it is the prankish implementation of so many of the quests:

Frankly, I have long held the opinion that these and other details show
a deliberate disrespect for traditional fantasy role-players, imposing
severe restrictions on your character if you choose a high fantasy
style of roleplay (at least for "good" characters).  Personally, I think
that Brad set out to yank some folks chains, and yank them he did.
These are the people who willingly overlook DAoC's flaws, the anti-
roleplay bias of the EQ environment outweighs the still substantial
advantage EQ has in depth of content.  At least, that's what I get from
those I know who left and didn't come back... the ones who came back
are the ones who find EQ's content more compelling than DAoC's stronger
encouragement of roleplay.

I didn't like DAoC personally, but then I didn't play at all after the
"free" month, and didn't play much then because I couldn't get it to
work worth a damn on my system.  But from the folks I know who left,
I'd say the big deal is "depth of content" (came back to EQ) vs.
"encouragement of roleplaying" (stuck with DAoC), the PvP differences
don't seem to matter a whole lot to any of the folks I know.
