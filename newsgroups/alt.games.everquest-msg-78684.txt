Youll learn to care about it. Think rare spawn, lets use Oasis and SK 
for examples:

Oasis:
The interesting spawns here are the SGs and Lockjaw. Both mobs can walk 
around for minutes without being seen (saw a SG spanw in the south 
corner, at the beach, i managed to med up and kill him, noone else 
appearantly knew he was there), and Lockjaw can hide quite well 
sometimes too.

SK:
Quillmane, rare spawn, drop cloak with levitate effect, part of mage 
epic. A tracker gain a LOT of bonus here, compared to mages just running 
around and hoping to run into him.
Brother Qwinn, High Shaman Phido, other named gnolls. All used for monk 
epic, or quest leading to monk epic. The zone is HUGE, so a soloing monk 
got next to no chance of finding the spawns, a druid can easily find them.
Cyclops/undead cyclops. Again random spawn, hear the undead one drop a 
skull for a pally quest. Again you will have a less than nothing chance 
of running into them if you just run around randomly to try and find them.


Most zones got some kind of rare/interesting mob (hey, i use it to get 
brownie meat from the low level scouts in GFay), and are generally worth 
checking, just to see if somethign interesting is up when you run 
through the area. Finding NPCs for quests are a LOT easier with track 
(ok, might not be much easier in Kelethin, but still help a little), and 
finding players are also great (althought finding players are often 
bugged, can show the wrong way, often until you get close enough to see 
the person).

So learn track, youll find you cant live without it.
