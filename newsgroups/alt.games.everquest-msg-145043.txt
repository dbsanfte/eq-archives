FYI, they cooked sea bass on Iron Chef last night. (HEY! It's a clearly
OT thread anyway!)  Most of it was pretty fucking disgusting looking.
Particularly the sashimi. (somehow, bass looks WAY worse than Tuna when
raw.)

Particularly when they took an entire bass, bones in all, and sealed it
in a fish shaped pie crust and baked it.

Ummm... ick.

I eat at some Japanese restaraunts, and have even been talked into
tryint the sushi bar, but man, they can do some seriously fucking
disgusting shit with a sea bass.
