Well, I didn't want to outright lie, so I didn't claim that I wouldn't
buy it.  But, it is at least theoretically possible that I'll refrain.
I hardly drink anymore, haven't smoked in a while, gave up tobacco
months ago (that was the hardest one by far, damned evil weed), so...
it might maybe be sort of possible I could give up EQ.
