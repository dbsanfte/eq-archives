Hey.

I have a 62 Iksar monk and I would like to learn pulling techniques, pathing
etc for the higher end zones.
In particular Ntov, Halls of Testing, Ssra and PoP zones. Are there any
links around for maps/tricks/tips?
I know this NG has some uber monks, so what better place could I start my
search?

Below is a link for my rubbishy gear - all no drop because I'm on Rallos Zek
:-)~ It's a little out of date, but any pointers to better stuff would help.

TIA.
