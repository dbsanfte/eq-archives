Here is a walkthrough.

Hail Frup Groaak in Castleview Hamlet. He gives you the quest "The
Missing." 
- Track down Giidib. He and Frup separated on the southern beaches of
Antonica. 
Go to the southern beach in Antonica. 
-Continue to track down Giidib 
Follow the waypoint to a log, examine it. 
Follow the waypoint to a rock, examine it. 
Follow the waypoint to a tree stump, examine it. 
Follow the waypoint to a tree, examine it. (You must look up at the
tree.) 
Follow the waypoint to a rock in the pond, examine it. 
- Lead Giidib back to the nearest guard tower. 
Giidib of the First Circle will spawn. Hail him, right-click him, and
select "Lead to guard tower." 
Giidib will now autofollow you to the Southern Qeynos Guard Tower,
where he dies. 
- Speak with Frup in Castleview Hamlet 
Hail Frup Groaak in Castleview Hamlet. 

Frup tells you "I must mediate on the news you have brought me. Return
to me later." 

You must wait approximately 1 hour to hail Frup again. 

"Avenging Spirit" 

Hail Frup Groaak in Castleview Hamlet. Frup gives you a new quest,
"Avenging Spirit." You receive "Shard of Marr" (activateable slot,
effect summon spirit of Giidib) 
- Seek out the assassin in Antonica and avenge Giidib. 
Go to Antonica, and use the Shard of Marr to summon "Spirit of Giidib."

Right-click the spirit of Giidib and choose to have him lead you to the
assassin (he walks veeeerrryyy slowly while doing so). 

From Shosuro... 
The assassin (level 28 mob) is in the Tower Of Vhalan 
Kill him and return to Frup in Castleview 
Hail Frup again, he should give you the third quest. If he doesn't,
hail him again immediately. (no hour wait) 

"When The Darkness Comes" 

From Shosuro... 

Return to Antonica and follow your Spirit to the Assassins Lair.
(forest in NE corner of map). 
Zone into the lair and fight through the assassins (groups and singles,
level 30 mobs) 

From Nekofrog... 

Kill through the instanced zone, then go hail Frup again to get a
Froglok Pondstone. 

Take the Froglok Pondstone to Crater Pond in Antonica. Use the
Pondstone while in or near the pond. (If you're having trouble getting
the update, walk from the Antoica Docks straight to Crater Pond. As
soon as the popup text for the location update comes on, stop moving,
and use the stone.) 

You are taken to the Froglok Village. You must finish a series of
quests to gain their trust. 

Stick: in the middle of the zone there will be a ramp that lets you go
up onto the wall. Go up and look in the tree a but further down, the
stick will be there. 

Channeling Gem: the miner constantly drops it and picks it up. Go to
him and wait for him to drop it, grab it, and go wash it off in the
barrel (the one next to the frog that gives you a firefly quest) 

Fireflies: he will give you a net that you equip, then USE whenever you
get the message "you sense fireflies nearby". Three times. 

Dolly: The little froggygirl's dolly is right behind her, behind the
tree. I also found one by where you get the stick, but it wasn't used
for anything. 

Cat Eating Totems: This is a really easy riddle to solve. Essentially,
start deducing from what he tells you. He says two trolls are the least
and the most cats. He says one troll ate MORE than one of those trolls,
so you know which one ate the most and the less. From those two, you
can easily work your way through the rest. 

Flowers: Flowers can be gathered easily, they stick out of the ground
and are quite the eyesores. I noticed them before I knew about the
quest.
