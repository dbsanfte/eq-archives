A couple times recently in Cobalt Scar, when I've got Wyvern's down to the
point where they want to slowly crawl away, they have disappeared.  They
still showed up on targetting, so I went looking around for them, and found
them standing back at their spawn point, and finished them off.

Last night, the same thing happened in Wakening Lands, with one of those
little dinosaur-like things near the Skyshrine entrance.  Nuke it down, it
switches to run away mode, and warps back to its spawn point.  From there,
it would slowly run away for about 30 seconds, and then would warp back to
the bind point again, and continue running.

I haven't done a lot of hunting in Cobalt Scar, but don't recall this
problem there before.  Same with Wakening Lands.  Is this a new problem, or
was I just lucky before?
