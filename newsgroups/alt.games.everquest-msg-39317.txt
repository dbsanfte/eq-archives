I've done this quest a number of times (at least four, two clerics
two each... but I've done it a couple times with friends too)
and never had to worry about the Zahal portion... Regis has
always been up for me immediately, no need to spawn him.

It is helpful to kill off all the undead nearby so you can pick
him up with sense undead... but once you know where
he hangs out,thats not necessary.  Just go to the wooden bridge
(zone to EK) and follow the river on up to the zone line, then
head west... from that vantage, he's going to be the closest
undead so you won't need to kill the greenies, and even if you
don't feel like using it, you'll simply stumble across him.

He's a caster mob by the way, cleric type (naturally) so you'll
get nuked with Wrath and he'll heal himself if you let him.
Any partner can take him down easy while you keep him
stunned... or your partner can interrupt him while you
use undead-nukeage
