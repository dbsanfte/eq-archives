Just so you know, I've never had a single spell or Windblade or Girdle of
Mithaniel drop for me whilst I was in HoH.

We were the second guild in the zone and I've completed a few aa levels
there, and I've not had a *single* one drop.  Even from the various 66/67
named mobs.

The only thing I've seen drop was 2 "soldiers swords" in about an 8 hour exp
session.

Theres too many people in HoH now though, its trained by retards just like
PoV.... I guess the peace was nice while it lasted.. off to the next tier
zone!
