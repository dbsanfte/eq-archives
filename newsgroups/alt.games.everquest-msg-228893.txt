Hehe!

Well apart from the shock that some people are getting from the much 
reduced timers on the Lull type Spells.

Ties Knot in fingers. I must read the Info on Harmony before I use it 
again.

Though I know how they feel to be on the receiving end of an entire room 
full pull.

While the Random HP Bars on group members is a great new addition for 
those Clerics wishing to get a tarnished record. the best I have heard 
so far is the Cleric who claims the HP bars he saw went down after he 
cast heal, only to find the clients of his attempted heal were already 
walking back to the party. While others watched as group members died 
and still saw 98% in their heal bars until they were resurrected at 
which point the HP bars declared them to be Undead.

Debate rages as to whether this is a true bug.

Or

The lag created by the hordes descending on the Casino tying up server 
CPU time rolling random numbers

Or

The random number generator for the casino being tied to the HP bar 
update code.

Take your pick and spin the wheel :)

Also it seems the new spell graphics have an involuntary stealth mode. 
Where the caster cannot see any effects while everyone else and the 
NPC's can

So if you are not sure that your reduced time Lull has taken effect 
because you cannot see any pretty dots around the target. Then you will 
need to send the monk into find out after all.

Or the failing that.

Log out of game onto the test server, patch, then back to the live 
server. As it seems SOE forgot to include a lot of the new effects 
graphics with the live patch.

Yours
