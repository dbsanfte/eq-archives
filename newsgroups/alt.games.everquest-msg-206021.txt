All pre level 9, so was doing undead only with my DE cleric.  Skeletons 
don't run all that fast.  I was self buffed only.  Flash of Light does 
not stop the mob I am meleeing from smacking me, fear does.  For that 
matter, being a DE cleric, I do fully intend on having a snare as soon as 
I get around to finishing the quest up.
