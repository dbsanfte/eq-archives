quit whining.  And get off your high horse.



1. I don't like dishonest people either.  
2. I'm not on a high horse.  
3. What comes around goes around.
4 In the end you get what you pay for.  
I certainly won't be getting any ulcers over liars and cheats.  Because I
*truly* believe in #3 and #4 <-- that goes for *real life* as well as *in
game*.
And for all the nay-sayers:  Appearances are deceiving.
