I had the same situation happen to me once before, but it was because
Windows decided to check for system updates while I was playing, and popped
a "New Updates Available" dialog on my desktop.  The screen briefly flashed
the dialog transparently through my EQ screen, and the desktop cursor
remained frozen in the middle of the screen until I finally quit playing for
the night, and logged off.
