At higher lvl, phat loots can be sodl 1k up to 40k even more with a bit of
luck.
This new loot rule will allow lower player to sell items even to mid and
high players.
This will dinamize the low/mid level loot economy. This is the good part !

The bad part :
Quest items like crap no drop stuff dropped by fungus mutant for the paw of
opolla quest ?
So all quest items doable alone only at high level will have to be at lower
level in full group.
Wow ! I camped 40 hours mutant to get weeds i had to camp it 13 hours
straight to get it at least.
Hopefully i dont have to roll with six other players after so long time
spent for this item.

Ancient Cyclop in Sro ??? Woohoo ! Imagine that. AC con green at 43 maybe
44. Try to solo AC as a warrior or any other melee class ! You ll be easily
KSed by any pure casters like wizzy, mages ...
And worse, a cleric will never be abble to get jboots unless grouping with a
group with enought ppl to outdamage a soloing wiz or mage and win the roll.
This unbalance class for FFA mobs !
Jboot will be only for mass damage casters and few lucky guys on roll.

Who will hunt in the deep end of crapy train dungeon as Uguk ? a train of 10
blue mobs with healers and casters ? Items like shimering orb, bracelet of
woven grass, gatorscale leggins / sleeves will became a rare loot being a
common drop. Lower level characters lacks spells and skills to handle well a
train dungeon (no good mez, no efficient FD, *crapy equip ?*, not enought
tanking ability)

These items will be farmed by low level over buffed by high level
guildmates. Low/mid level will be high level loot pets hehe. It s almost
worse than farming if you dont have a guild and just beguin game.

These are my predictions, i m not really keen of this loot rule. Wait and
see ...
