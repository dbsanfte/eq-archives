OK, I got over my laziness and did a Google search. After skipping all the
"Sex tips DVD" and the "Nude Celebrities" pages (yes, I'll admit I'm a
pervert, but not when I'm in the middle of a quest), I finally found an
E!Online news article written in 1997 that gave the spartan details that
Heidi Fleiss was a drug using hooker who thought it was strange that the
courts would have a problem with her chosen profession. Now I'm off to order
that DVD with the sex tips. ;)
