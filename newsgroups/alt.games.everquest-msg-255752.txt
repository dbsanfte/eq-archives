    The requirements have dropped, but so have the relative rewards - to the
point where (for example) almost no guild is making a serious attempt to key
up for VT - there are simply better ways to get that level of gear now, even
though the barriers are lower due to everyone being higher level and already
having crap they stumbled on in Veksar, or bought from a McLDoN McMerchant.

    I guess this has as much to do with the rate of mudflation as anything -
and it probably pisses me off more than it does you - but the fact is that
most of the raid targets my guild can now hit, are no longer worth hitting.
I can't tell you how pissed off I was when we finally started hitting THO.
*just* at that point it got to the stage where I no longer coveted his FT3
helm, after 40 levels of drooling over it and praying for one day...

    And by the time we can smack past the 70-person blockage in PoP and
access the stuff we could probably drop NOW, we will be level 70 nutcases
wearing GoD drops and bazaar catch-ups that make elemental gear barely worth
the effort, if at all.

    But I must stress: I accept most of that as the lot of the
non-uberguildie. The parts I have problems with are the 70-person raids
blocking access to the 30-person raids or single-group content. The raiding
content should be in order of difficulty, and at no point should somone who
can't mount raids be locked out of more than one or two zones per expansion.
If you gotta key off half a zone, make most of that half questable.

    So how does my taking part in a 40 person raid differ in effort from
your taking part in a 70 person raid?

    Hmm, there is no such thing as a velious or a luclin geared person
anymore, you are aware of that, no?

    Yeah, huge part of the reason why *nobody* is doing it anymore.

    The AA's and aug's might be a bit off but the gear pieces are at least
there and the numbers seem close to accurate.
