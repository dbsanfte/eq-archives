hardly, the serious gamer finds a way to disable it in 4.5 seconds.

Freeware, works great. Once running uses zer cpu time (shows in
wintop, glad that works in 98 still .. ;) ) )

allocated 32 bit mem usage like 132 k 

After using it the windows key simply does nothing. After reading a
similar post where a person was lamenting and having just got a
windows keyboard with the key for the first time, I found the utility
in 4.5 seconds on hotbot with "freeware windows key disable." Or some
such thing. Search engines are nice.

You can make a short cut to it in startup and no more windows key
hitting. Nice thing is that hitting it again in the startup folder
removes it and the windows key works again, then hitting it again runs
it and its working again.
