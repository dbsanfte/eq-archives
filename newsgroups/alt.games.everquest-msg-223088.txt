all levels =)

2 handed weapons seem to be the best bet for a long time

i dont know the level when necro pets dual wield . .i believe it's 34 but it
might be 39? generally some mage-summoned 1h weapons will beat out a 2h
weapon (with a few exceptions) when dual wield is available

if you want the OT gate hammer (which is really no longer such a fun thing,
with PoK), don't hunt in KC...you'll probably be able to do the hammer quest
depending on your religion

otherwise, you can answer this question best yourself -- what quests do you
plan on doing?

if the mob isn't fleeing, you can't (mob will need to be hitting
something/someone).......now........

assuming the mob isn't rooted (necro's dont get root until 34, IIRC), you
just need to kind of spam the pet back off command

you should have it (along with pet attack) hotkeyed .. just mash it a few
times and you can get the killshot with your lifespike
