Considering your prior arguments, that's a bit of a reach,
isn't it?  AC is good only after it reaches a point consistent
with the force of the blow.  In the case of that enchanter,
it doesn't matter if they're wearing a cotton (300 AC) or
flax (600 AC) robe, they're still not going to stop a sword,
right?  Only when the "magical properties" add up to enough
AC does it kick in and mitigate blows, which is how the AC
system works on lower AC people.  You take full blows until
your AC kicks in, then it mitigates it as it increases, then
it fails once ATK passes the 'magic' number of your AC.  Add
in level-based inate AC (to represent the difference between
being able to attack a 8 year old in plate and an adult in
plate, for instance) and you essentially get EQ's AC system,
at least up until the point where AC no longer scales.

Other than the very top end, where the system fails because
it no longer scales, who says it's not functional?
