Third account up and running, yes another friend who had quit for DAoC has
let me take over his account, hmm this could get expensive. Now have access
to a 51st Enchanter, as well as a few mid level characters. Unfortunately,
like the last one, I have to work on equipping this one (as well as 37th
Wizard) as they have been pretty much stripped of all and sundry. The items
were given to another caster in the guild who, shortly after that, left :ï¿½/
Anyway, got some ideas for main items. SMR gonna be hard to replace now,
being part of 2 classes Epics, looking at shardwurm skin and white scale
legs (like the leather dominatrix look it gives) arms will get some Greater
Finespun sleeves and the usual jewellery for neck, ears and fingers..it's
wrists, hands, feet, head (prolly a runed circlet going there) and primary
hand (stein in off hand, guess my Ex-Guild mate had one already)
Any suggestions welcome, got about 6k to spend, mainly on the Enchanter,
Wizard will just end up as an extra Taxi, I should imagine.

The character is never going to replace my main or be used in any situation
other than a Guild group (where everyone is aware that I am using 2
characters) So I am not concerned with being equipped to even minor raid
level,  just have enough mana to be support.
