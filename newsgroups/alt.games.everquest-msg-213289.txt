Oh, good.  We thought this was the death of our after-midnight BoT tower
raids.  =)

Uh oh... this may completely nerf our strategy.  My guild - using a strategy
unique in EQ as far as I know - pulls FR past all the respawning guards to
the bottom of the ramp.  Tank engages him solo, paladins (somehow, not
certain) keep Fennin Ro in place, everyone, but everyone else engages with
ranged weapons.  This may not work any more.

We'll just have to try and see.
