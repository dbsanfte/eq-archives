Hello all, 
I wanted to update you all on our current thoughts regarding the Trivial
Loot Code as it relates to Shadows of Luclin zones. 

As per my last couple of 'Ask Brads', we've made both an effort to
explain what the Trivial Loot Code does and why we were considering it
for all Luclin zones. I'd also mentioned, however, that if most players
appeared to be against its inclusion we'd not use it. 

After talking with players, reading emails and feedback, and then very
recently running a poll, it is indeed apparent that the majority of our
playerbase does not feel that the Loot Code's advantages outweigh its
restrictions. 

In fact, after polling over 200,000 players, most want the looting
system left alone, almost as many want us to explore a different
solution for bottom feeding and rampant farming, and a minority were in
favor of the Trivial Loot Code as it exists today in the Warrens and
Stonebrunt Mountains (the remainder either didn't have an opinion or
were unfamiliar with TLC). 

Well, so be it 

We will head back to our drawing boards and keep brainstorming on this
issue, but at this current time we do NOT intend on implementing TLC for
the zones in our upcoming expansion, the Shadows of Luclin. 

I do want to thank everyone for all the feedback and discussion
regarding this issue -- there was a lot of debate surrounding this
issue, and we've done our best to pay attention.
