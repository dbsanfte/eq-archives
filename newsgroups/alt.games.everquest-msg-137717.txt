This predetermination/free will thing is an issue for  you I can tell
<G>.  I like to think of it as more predisposition rather than
predetermination.  You are born with tendencies that if followed will
lead you in a given direction, but that is not to say that you must
follow them.  Free will can over come natural inclinations as anyone who
has resisted the urge to rip their boss' throat out with their teeth can
attest to.  If there is a god I think that free will was one of his
sneakiest tricks so rather than share your wish for that to be an over
riding factor negating predetermination, I'd prefer it the other way
around so I don't have to feel bad when my will is weak hehe.  I don't
believe that, I just wish it were so.
