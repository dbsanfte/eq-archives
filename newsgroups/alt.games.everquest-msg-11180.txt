I don't know if you have ever heard of Martin Bryant. A few years back he
shot and killed 35 people in Tasmania with an M-16 assault rifle. 20 of
these were killed in the first 90 seconds, the first 12 in 15 seconds.

At the inquiry, the authorities were told this would not have been possible
without this sort of weapon.

He wouldn't have been able to accomplish this had he been armed with a
revolver, a pump
shotgun, a lever-action rifle, or a bolt-action rifle.

This led directly to the banning of owning automatic and semi-automatic
weapons by most people in Australia.
