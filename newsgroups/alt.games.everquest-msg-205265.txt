With haste, you get 1 each of three different varieties of haste:

Item
Song/Spell
Overhaste.

In each case, if you have more than one of that type, the higher will win.
In some cases, they MAY stack, and on other cases they may overwrite. If
they "stack" - say a bard song and a chanter haste, the stacking will not be
in the actual haste amount, but rather in the other buffs the song may
provide (usually STR and ATK).

Overhaste is technically a song, but is a different class of song hastes and
is only provided by bards. It should not, however, be confused with a bards
regular haste line. The songs that fall in the "overhaste" category include
the Ervaj and VahShir lines, as well as Rizlona's. This "overhaste" line not
only allows them to add to the haste of the regular haste song/spells, but
also allows for the exceeding of the haste cap (100% for a level 60 or
above). So,

Shissar (chanter epic) is 60% +  41% haste item = 101%, but this would be
trimmed back to the 100% cap. There is also a 66% haste, but again, the
resulting 107% would be trimmed back to 100%. Add in a bards overhaste line
tho, and you you get the 100% you had before plus the overhaste amount (up
to 30%) for a max of 130%.

As to snare/slow. Some of them overwrite each other (complete replacement),
but generally the slow/snares stack, with the larger one in each category
winning. The Bind song (20) you mentioned does NOT stack with Largos, but
does with chains. Chains and Largos stack with the snare of chains winning,
the slow being the same, and the debuffs from largo's winning (chains
doesn't have them).

Hope this helps.
