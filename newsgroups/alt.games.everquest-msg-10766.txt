Had a frustrating session last night trying to kill FreePort guards
(for helmets - quest), and I'm wondering if anyone can help.  Here's
what was happening:

I didn't want to wreck my faction, and since the guards were green to
me, I tried to arrange it so that my partner, a level 20 ogre shaman,
would get the credit for the kill.  We'd find the guard alone and my
partner would attack, doing at least some damage.  I'd then root it,
snare it, DOT it like crazy, and then gate out.  My partner would stay
behind until the guard died, with intent to gate out as well if
another guard came by.

It was a good plan, I thought, but when the guard died, it "poofed".
No faction or exp for the shaman, and no guard corpse.

I know my partner did at least some damage, even if it was only 1
point.

Any ideas?
