Sorry, not possible to macro eqipment changes. What you can do is
hotkey the inventory slot that has the bag you keep the equipment in
and the proper equip slots in one bank of keys. If the bag is in
hotkey slot 1, press 1 to open it and switch out all the equipment
without having to open your inventory window. I do this for changing
instruments/weapons on my bard.
