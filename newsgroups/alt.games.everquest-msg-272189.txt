Still, I wish there was a formalized way of out-sourcing. I.e., a way to
announce on the market that you need e.g. 10 crude Burlap Patterns and is
willing to pay 50s for them. A reversed broker concept, so to speak. The guy
who gets the order would see it in his journal as a tradeskill quest, and
once completed, he would be instructed to contact the customer for the
exchange of goods and coin, just as with tradeskill quests today.

I realize that this is essentially what you can do via the chat channels,
but in my limited experience, there's more "chatting" than "dealing" going
on there.
