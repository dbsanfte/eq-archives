I am normally pretty much inclined to be pessimistic and have a poor
attitude about everything in general, but with each patch lately I have been
finding it harder and harder to keep the negative EQ facade going. Whilst Mr
McQuaid might may be a guru world builder for making worlds for "enthusiasts
to work in", I think the new blood is equally talented in making a damn good
"playground for the rest of us to have fun in".

Luclin character models are great - heck, I even appreciate the overly
chested femmes - Let's just say that maybe Norathian farmers have been using
too many hormones in their stock feed too and leave it at that : )
