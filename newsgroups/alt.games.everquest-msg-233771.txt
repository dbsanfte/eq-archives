You might want to try make up a small group or duo in South Karana.
The Aviak Village gives good XP and fair loot (the odd bronze weapon,
a gem or two...) or take out Gnolls at Splitpaw Spires.  The Gnolls
drop Fine Steel weapons, worth 5plat, and sometimes drop a few
platinum coins, too - the XP is very good indeed!

I prefer the Gnolls, personally, as if you bite off more than you chew
you can run a very short distance into the Splitpaw lair, and zone in
until it is safe to emerge again.  :)
