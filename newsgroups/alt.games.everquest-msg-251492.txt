I've just come back from a days duoing with a mage in UP. At no point have I
said that I don't have grouping experience, here or elsewhere. What I don't
have is experience in LDON.

Now, what I am being is social. I am dealing with others as a social entity
not a selfish xp grinding machine. I choose to buff others except when they
ask for it, or announce some no-drop item is rotting, not because it
benefits me but because I like people. I've been an officer in two (or three
? can't recall) guilds and could have been the leader of one, but didn't
have the time.

If someone said the same thing to me, I'd take the time to show them the
ropes. I have done, many times, in other zones and types of groups. What I
could do is lie, enter into the LDON with no idea what traps to watch out
for, which mobs summon or are snare/root immune, or will aggro in an
enormously out of proportion way. When I was killing giants in GD, I was
amazed how much aggro a heal would cause, when compared to fighting vampires
in Ten. mountains say. When I fought Ice Giants, I was appalled to find they
were immune to spells unless you were in melee range, and am glad someone
took the time to tell me.

I don't have trouble grouping. I have trouble finding social players in EQ;
most of the ones I knew left for CoH or similar games. The ones left just
wanna get to 65, Time, GoD, and you are just a means to an end.
