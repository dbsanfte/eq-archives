Can say with utter certainty that that is false with PoP mobs at least. My
charmed pet hits every bit as hard as the intended victim. And, a while back
they DID nerf the exp given from Charmed pets. It was quite some time back
though.

Now they may have nerfed the Mob damage with OOW mobs, but I Coudlnt say one
way or the other with that. Havent tried charming in OOW yet.
