Well, you don't mention your class, but at level 22 you'd get insane xp in
SolA if you had a partner of a complimentary class (healer for your tank,
vice-versa, etc).  You'd have the added benefit of at least knowing what the
"window" that you climb through is...and where the nearest zone line to SolB
is...all without slowing down the raid on Sunday.

Keep in mind that goblins backstab, so running away can be deadly.  Also
keep in mind that lava baths are generally unpleasant, so watch your step.
If you can cast (or get it on you) levitate, DO IT before you zone in.  If
you can cast Gate, HAVE IT MEMMED until you get to your camp spot away from
lava.

SolA has a wonderful dungeon experience modifier, so take advantage of that.
It's also a fun zone for those who like the old-style plumber's-crack
goblins. :)
