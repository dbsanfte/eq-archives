EPox 8RDA+ (Asus also makes a great NF2 board AN???? Deluxe)

NForce2 chipset.
6chl Audio onboard (better than SBLive! and Audigy, works great in EQ)
6 USB ports (at least 2 are USB 2.0) ports
2 Firewire ports
10/100 LAN built-in
AGPx8 support

If you get an AthlonXP revision "B" , the CPU is automatically
unlocked in BIOS. It makes overclocking a dream. I am running my 1700+
(1.47ghz) at 2000+ (1.67ghz) by simply upping the multiplier in the
BIOS. No extra cooling required. 

All of the onboard components run directly through the chipset, not
the PCI bus. Thus less latency, and fewer CPU cycles required.

I have gone through a LOT of MBs over the last 7 years, and this one
is by far the best. Fast, stable, and packed with features. All for
less than $100.00USD.

You can read up on the NF2 boards at the following sites,,,
