I sooooooo hope that's the case.  That would be a good reason to bring a
paladin along.  Especially if they made an entire curse class of spells and
only gave Paladins and Clerics the cure (or the best cures).  Paladins would
have a definate raid role (since you'll need every single cleric with the
modrod nerf).

It will be strangely satisfying to see FoH have to zerg.  Of course, that
won't outweigh the rest of the suckitude.

Still, it's not quite right to have a class that hits like a ranger and
tanks like a warrior.  I think the nerf is actually appropriate here.
