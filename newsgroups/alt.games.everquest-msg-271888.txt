A bit of a tip, if you have a troubadour friend. My husband and I
discovered that the "enforced dance" that troubadours can cast does NOT
stop when you sit or jump or run (like the emote /dance) does. So I've
found it very handy for creating:

1. The Enthusiastic Jump - great for when your group just took down a
REALLY tough mob.  Also can double as the Insane Lizard (for convincing
unwanted 'Can I jion ur grp?' types that your character is insane and will
get them killed).

2. The Drowning Maid - Sit in the water and watch your arms flail!

3. The Terrified Coward - simply running away froma mob too boring?  Do it
with style!  Add in a good /say AAAAAAAGGGGGHHHH! for flavour

I'm almost tempted to buy the "enforced bow" of the templar, to see if it
causes my character to run with their head down, as if they were trying to
head-butt someone.
