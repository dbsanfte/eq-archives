In short, no.  Camping is not protected or really even allowed.  A
spawn is fair game until it is attacked by someone.  Until that
happens, it's anyone's spawn....regardless of whether someone's been
sitting at that spawn site for hours or not.

So, if you're going to camp (WHEN you camp, really), remember that your
doing so isn't a protected action in the game.  You are keeping others
from the spawn and should be polite about it.  However, for the sake of
playing nice, if you come across a spawn/spawn site that is camped by
someone else, try to work something out between you.  No, they don't
have any more right to the spawn than you do, but it's polite to share
since they have been waiting and you haven't.

If you can't work something out or the 2 of you get into a shouting
match....just remember, if you hit it first it's yours.  If the other
player does it's his/hers.  You don't want to kill steal, because the
GMs WILL take action against kill stealing if petitioned.
