A newbie with a few questions on this guild.

Will newbies be allowed? Some time in the next week, I'll get the game
installed on my new  comp (grumbles about how it could possibly take so long
to get here.). I've been playing on MUSHes and MUXes for years, as well as
playing (and D/GMing) AD&D and BESM. I love role-playing. Would I be allowed
in, even being a complete newbie?

Is this friendly roleplaying or 'rp nazis?' I mean, do you consider harcore
roleplayers those who use 'thee' and 'thy' exclusively? Or is it people who
actually use correct spelling and grammer (unless they play an ogre or
troll, of course) and play as their role would?

How big are you expecting this guild to be? You want a gazillion players,
thirty, or a dozen?

Here's an idea; how about requireing pending members to send in a backstory
for his/her character. you shouldn't be expecting a book, of course, but it
could give a good clue to people who can actually role play. You could put
these up on a section of the web page.

Would OOCly giving advice to non-roleplayers or k3wl dOOds be considered
treason? I think not talking to anyone who doesn't roleplay is kind of
snobbish.

I'm really interested in this guild, and if you could anwer my questions,
I'd definetly want to join (even though I usually don't like guilds, this
one sounds nice.)

Here are pending names for my first characters (may change.) If you wanna,
talk to 'em. I'll probably be starting on the Fennin Ro server.

Kiyabad--Wood elf Ranger

Syntel--High elf magician

Dauraun--Human Monk

Sealarone--Erudite cleric.

(puns like this aren't considered off limits, are they? You wouldn't even
notice them unless you were actively seeking them out, and even then,
they're very loose.)

For the very confused--Syntel= Intel Kiyabad= Keyboard Dauraun=Duron
Sealarone= Celeron
