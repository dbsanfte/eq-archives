I don't do BoT much since I dislike the crowds but I'd agree as far as
Tactics and HoH go. The problem comes in on multiple pulls where
you're faced with the choice between healing or slowing an add. Often,
if I'm grouped with a druid, Q will do most of the healing but the
druid is in charge with keeping the group alive until mobs are slowed
and the pull is under control.
