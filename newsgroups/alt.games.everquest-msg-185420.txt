    Pretty sure that's focussing of spirit and they're Str/Agi/AC - dex and
stamina buffs are separate IIRC.

    Aego, virtue and C3 are all 2.5 hours standard (IIRC) but most casters
have extension AA etc now it seems.

    Yeah there's a couple of haste spells that last a long while, I wont go
and look them up but speed of vallon, speed of the shissar and visions of
grandeur spring to mind. Have had them all casted on me and all seem to last
a bloody long time. (vallon and grandeur particularly)
