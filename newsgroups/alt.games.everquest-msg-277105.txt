I always try to accept drive-by group invites, because in EQ1 there's
no penalty attached to doing so.  I then just continue on with what
I'm doing.  Usually, I get these offers while I'm doing something
*other* than hunting XP, and I'm more than willing to get free XP
while I'm tradeskilling or killing greens for loot drops.

Plus it's sometimes fun to be telling them (in PoD or wherever) "I'll
be there in a couple of minutes" while I'm travelling through Eastern
Wastes on my way to ToFS or KD.
