Not even close.  It's bizbee, Lokari, and Dark Tyger that stink up this
group.  There's a few others here who sheepishly back them, but KF those 3
and the signal/noise ratio here decreases at least an order of magnitude.
Best part, you'll still see great posts and lots of helpful/friendly posts
by serious EQ fans - not just the abusive content from a few disturbed
individuals.
