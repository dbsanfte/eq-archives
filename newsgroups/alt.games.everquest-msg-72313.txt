Thanks to the daily patches and Trak respawns, my guild is finally
reaching critical mass on VP keys (and it's about damn time, I've been
ready for a couple months).  We're probably going to have 24-30 ready
to hit it this week, and another 20 in the two weeks after that, and
we've got tons of experience in big raid mobs and ToV.  (We have done
entire ToV nights with only one or two puller deaths, can handle two
wurms at once, and have several DB wizards.)
I'm hoping that some of the uberest here can give me some advice about
this zone.  I've read stuff I've found on the spoiler sites about
this, but I'm looking for all the info I can get.  How tough are the
two guardian wurms at the ent, especially compared to ToV guardians?
Do they drop enough to make them worth farming?  Does the respawn
timer start when the first one dies or when they're both dead?  Is
that little alcove above the first bridge a good camp spot? Are there
mobs in the lava tunnel, or is FR and lev useful for moving around?
Any other advice you can give.  (Oh, and yeah, should probably skip it
and go straight to ST, but really want a couple epic warriors, so
we're trying for scales this way.)
