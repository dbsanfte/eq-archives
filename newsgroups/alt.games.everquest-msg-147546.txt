The moment every traveller lives for is the native dinner where, throwing
caution to the wind and plunging into a local delicacy which ought by
rights to be disgusting, one discovers that it is not only delicious but
that it also contradicts a previously held prejudice about food, that it
expands ones culinary horizons to include surprising new smells, tastes,
and textures.

Lutefisk is not such a dish.
