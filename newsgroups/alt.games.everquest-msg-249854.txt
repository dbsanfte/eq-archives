Feel free to cite other sites/statistics. I have yet to see anyone 
conclude that an execution is cheaper, except ignorant/naive people who 
simply assumed that it should be. All research on the topic that I've 
seen has invariably found the economics favour incarceration.

The key word, in my view is 'comparable' in the phrase 'comparable 
non-death cases', which is suggestive of the fact that cases where they 
were handing out 10 year sentences would not be comparable.

In a life sentence the implication that incarceration ends when the life 
ends is obvious. If however, the life sentence was overturned eventually 
due to appeals or whatnot then incarceration would end early. Those 
early releases are legitimate for the comparison, imo.

Consider this then:
