Its certainly not true that Necromancers don't have to meditate.  They
merely meditate -during- the fights, very rapidly getting back mana while
(due to lifetap-over-time, or LOTs) not losing hp.

What they don't have to do is meditate between fights.  In fact, its
often counterproductive to do so since the LOTS last less time
than the HP to Mana Over Time (H/MOT) spells they are constantly
running, its better if LOM to LOTS a blue and let the pet kill it while
you med, rather than remain sitting and watching your HP actually
trickle away.

Really meditating, without the H/MOT running, is simply intolerably
slow, no necro worth his salt will consider it on any regular basis
unless clarity is available.

Indoors, since you don't have the luxury of fear kiting, you'll likely
have to med a little between fights, while waiting for pet hp to regen.
Pet HP regen at ten times the rate of a players, but frequently this
would leave you FM and waiting, so you dump some mana into
pet heals, thus necessitating some med time.  You'll also have dumped
more mana into DOTs than you would have outdoors, making up for
what you would have spent on fears, no savings there.
