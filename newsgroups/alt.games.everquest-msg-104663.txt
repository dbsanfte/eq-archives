Virtually everyone does.  My second-highest level character is a
druid.  A very high percentage of players have a druid as either their
main or an alt.

It isn't that I think druids are *powerful* per se, just that they're
extremely useful.  SoW, ports, all those useful utility spells like
camo, lev and EB, etc.  The class solos quite well.

People play druids so they can have all those nifty spells for
themselves, and up to level 50, there is no downside, other than not
being "best" at anything, which isn't much of a downside.

Then you hit the 50's and you discover that you really aren't
necessary on raids.  You *are* useful, as is every class, just not
required.  I feel this is as it should be.  THIS is your downside.

It is my contention that it is that downside which prevents all the
servers from being overrun with druids.  One shudders to think how
many druids there would be if everyone like me who has a retired one
started playing them again.

There is nothing wrong with discussing them.  Just don't expect
everyone to take your side :)
