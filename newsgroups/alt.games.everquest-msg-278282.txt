The pets you mention are Summoner pets. I believe Wizards get
"familiars", which are kinda non combat pets. I'm not sure if they
offer any benefit or not, my familiarity with Wizards comes from
watching over the girlfriend's shoulder. Summoners later divide off
into Necromancers (Freeporters) and Conjurers (Qeynos). Necromancers
summon undead combat pets, while Conjurers summon elementals.
