I will admit to occasionally wondering where one died (usually the culprit
was up in a tree), but just the added time of destroying or dropping stuff,
assuming you have the sane confirmations on, is a pain.

Second account is definitely the best option.  No need to bind and gate
back, if you're bound at a bank (Bazaar my preference) literally load up til
you can't move and beyond.  I wouldn't recommend getting a second account
*just* for that though.  :)

Part of that is level.  You talk about dropping 5 or 7 before the corpses
rot, and if I get a good run of spawns I can have 15 or 20 laid out before
the corpses rot.  At 15 pp average (probably pretty close, though I'd guess
closer to 20), that's two a minute, 120 an hour, 120 x 15 = 1800 pp.

About right.  I can do 2k+ an hour if I push and about 1500 an hour if I'm
being lazy.

You'll probably find that if you want to go the disposable pet route you
need a quicker solution.  The 49 fire pet will solo a HG just fine.

Best reason to have somebody along is cause they're nice.  Makes the time
more enjoyable (and killing HGs can get quite repetitive).  Levels will help
you out a ton, but you won't be making 3k an hour.  I can break 2k an hour,
but I don't think I've ever come close to 3k an hour, and I can kill the HGs
and all placeholders about as fast as anybody could hope to.

Then again, I can make 2k an hour when there's a half dozen other people
trying for HGs, so if I ever caught the place empty I might surprise myself.
