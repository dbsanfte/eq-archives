I always kinda liked the fact that the hell levels were there and tried to
use them to my advantage.  I really hate the fact that they're apparently
going away.  The hell levels give a chalenge because you have to alter your
play style if you want to grind experience to get through them as quick as
possible.  They also, in my case, give me a chance to play catch-up on those
shrugged off weapon skills that I forgot about but don't want to get too far
behind in.

This one really pisses me off.  Maybe I'm looking at it from a twisted
angle, but I had to go through it, so could everyone else.
