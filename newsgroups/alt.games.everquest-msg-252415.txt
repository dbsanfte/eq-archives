True.. but at least we have the other side :>.

# of bazaar traders is another of those anecdotal observations.
Reasons could be everything from older machines hacking on the DX9 or
the fact some of the accounts people may have shut down are their
mules, opting instead to sell through the night on their main account.

I'm not saying we didn't lose some people.. and that didn't also spark
a meeting and get fixes in. But it certainly hasn't caused a
system-wide shutdown on progression as of 6/24 from guilds unable to
play their current content because players are off in WoW/CoH, smoking
dope, sexing up women, or whatever else is done outside of EQ :>.
