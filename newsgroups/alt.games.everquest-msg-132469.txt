Ok question for all you experienced EQ gamers=)

A guildie gave me my 51 spell upheavel last night, but it says CLR only.  I
of course tried to scribe it, and it did not work.  The guildie that gave it
to me told me that yea it says clr only, but druids can scribe it.. said she
did it and worked fine.  OK.. so what's up with me? why can't I scribe it?
Is there a nerf or something?

/em wants her better AOE spell=(

TIA for info=)
