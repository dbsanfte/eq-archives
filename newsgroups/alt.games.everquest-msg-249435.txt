The point of the week long trial is to show that removing the travel
system in order to impress on people they are in a 'big world'.. is
anything but fun in actual play. All this mythizing the past is funny
to me.. but in reality you'd have a lot of pissed off people from the
unweildiness of it all. It would be kind of like wearing a throwback
uniform for a week :>. Ahh ya.. i remember those.... now back to
normal kk!

And plus... nobody forces you to use the travel features. Delete your
LoY maps and only use druid and wizard ports to get anywhere.
