I just started a Froglok cleric on Stromm the other day. I don't think I was
even able to get through more than 1 level before I got frustrated and went
back to one of my regular characters. Is the froggy starting city that
cluttered and crazy? Is this just a case of all the starting cities being
swamped in the new server or are certain starting areas worse than others?
It didn't seem so bad when I started my barbarians.
