Now -this- I want. I don't need more than 8 spell slots. I can run out of
mana fast enough with 8 as it is, I don't need more. What we need is less
downtime and a friendlier interface. Having "spell sets" means we still
spend the same time memming the spells, but at least I don't have to flip
through 20 pages of book to set up my "aide-station" line up, or my
soloing line-up, or my grouping line-up, travelling spells etc etc ad
infinitum...
