The 3rd world is an entire additional magnitude of personal detachment 
farther away. Its common knowledge that people do not feel the same 
level of personal obligation to abstract masses far away as they do to 
local individuals, and by extension a local society does not feel the 
same level of oblication to abstract masses to local members.

Plus the 'world society' is too diluted and fragmented to even have much 
in the way of real 'societal characteristics'. Society is defined by 
common culture, shared institutions and values, mutual interests, etc... 
the commonalityies in the world society are minimal at best right now. 
Its hardly surprising that the burden of obligation it shoulders on its 
members is vastly lower than a much more tightly knit society like a 
single city or country.
