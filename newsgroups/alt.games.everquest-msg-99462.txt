No. I am saying that not being conveniently able to stare at the mob
non stop doesn't stop me from enjoying the game. I have seen pretty
much every single mob I have ever gotten any exp for (some raids have
had a few too many melees around to actually see the mobs) and would I
really like killing the stuff I did in my 20s and low 30s any more if
I'd watched them non stop instead of watching them while I cast my
spells? Heck, if I wanted to see them during the whole fight, I could
just stand up and watch and not med again till we had downtime while
waiting for the puller. If I want to see raid mobs, I can. Gawk at
them _all_ for the entire fight at the cost of frame rate, I don't.
The things that matter are the text box, the health bars, my status
bars, and to see the areas I travel through and to see enough of what
I am fighting to judge how to best kill it or how to best help my
group kill it, and to appreciate the graphical representation. And I
have always had more than enough of that to keep me playing.
Fixing the book and meditation was a great thing. Losing the book is
just candy, and I'd be much happier to get back the 'whatever begins
to cast a spell' messages that went bye bye in the patch, as losing
THOSE have way more impact than the book did.
