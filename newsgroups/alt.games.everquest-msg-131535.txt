My friend's a level 53 pally and she has her FA, which is fine under
most circumstances, but we're looking for something for her to use
when her only job is holding aggro.  A friend let her try out a
Defiance and she liked that because it was so fast, but I'm thinking
maybe a Sword of the Morning or something of that nature with a nice
aggro-producing proc?  She's using a CoF for haste and is often
grouped with a bard for further haste.

Thinking maybe 8k tops.  1H slash would be nice since she needs to use
that skill more than she does.

Thanks :)
