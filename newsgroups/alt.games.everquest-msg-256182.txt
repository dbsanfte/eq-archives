*sigh* I have even tried asking out in POK for help with the 
Underking in Chardok, I have asked friends if they could possibly 
scrounge together a COTH mage/rogue pair and a tank to go along 
with husbands shammy for slowing, and me for healing to get the 
d@mned king and no luck...

I have all my shards, all I need is that blasted king and 
ragefire...there was one guild that supposedly was going to help, 
but then never heard from them again, and the 3 people that I was 
incontact with seem to never be ingame at all....and I am online 
off and on all day, and in strange hour combinations...My own 
guild is a family guild, and I am one of the higher levels in 
it=\ normal levels run 35-55...it was recently gutted by a member 
starting his own guild and taking the upper level members with him.
