This may or may not help, as your system has a higher spec than mine so
might not be the same problem...

I had this problem the first time I logged in after SoL was released (I
don't have it). I was turning really slowly, running in slow motion, and
couldn't outrun a skeleton even with SoW up. Everybody else seemed to be
animating in slow-mo but running a lot faster than me. This was on a P3 500,
256 RAM, Geforce 2MX.

The problem was that my system simply couldn't handle the textures (default
setting is High). I set it to Low and everything was back to normal.

I've since upgraded to 768Mb and a GeForce 3, and everything runs okay even
with High textures, Mip-Mapping and Social Animations (although I haven't
run into many Vah Shir lately). :)
