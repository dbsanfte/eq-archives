I don't get this and unless I'm missing something, I disagree.

From the standpoint of total xp points attributed, the druid will get
only an extremely small % of total xp points, like 2-3%. I'm not going
to go to the xp charts for research, but I would bet that the grouping
bonus will essentially make up for any xp the SK loses.

From the standpoint of how much of a bubble is earned by each -- that
is, the % increase in the xp bar -- the information given is inadequate.

Generally you start with each person getting the same amount of xp, in
terms of % of the xp bar.  Then you apply race penalties but not class
penalties to the group.  Which means, absent any race differential, the
SK will be getting 20% LESS relative xp than a druid.  The druid's xp
bar will actually rise faster.

The race penalty will not make any difference in how xp is shared, but
will be relevant to the question of whether or not xp would be faster
grouped or solo.  Generally I would expect that if you want to play
your SK, having your druid attached is going to be a great idea, since
the druid adds a lot in terms of downtime, adds a little group bonus,
and will hardly affect the SK's xp at all.  Grouping the druid will
increase both SK's and (obviously) the druid's xp.

But if you want to play your druid, I am betting he will get xp faster
solo, even including the group bonus.
