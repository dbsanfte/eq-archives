    To try and be fair, this may have happened in the early days of EQ when
people with Bind were rarer (heck, when there was fewer people!) and people
were running across unfamiliar zones to be with friends. But today? I'm with
Dennis - no way I could tell you the last person to bind my 55 rogue in
Thurg. I can tell you who bound her on the moon, though - the Soulbinder in
Shadow Haven.
