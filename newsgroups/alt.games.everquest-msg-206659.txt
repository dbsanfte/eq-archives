Just by chance, I leveled all the way up to 26 on my level 20 spells, 
all the way thinking how much I'd like to have my 24 spells to mem 
instead.  Well it turns out there was no reason to worry about that, I 
probably wouldn't have ended up using them anyway!  Oh, and I had my 24 
pet in a backpack but didn't remember that fact, at any rate my pet 
didn't die once between hitting 24 and the time I left,  and as little 
use as he saw it would really have been a waste of a tiny dagger to kill 
him and cast the 24 one.

In a group the pet seems like more of a handy chanter protection device 
than a damage dealer, while soloing or with a partner it becomes an 
important contribution (at least so far).   Thing is, mobs go up faster 
than players in terms of HP and damage dealt, so I have to wonder, will 
this pet plus alacrity and tepid deeds be as worthwhile to solo with as 
was my level 12 pet with the buffs and debuffs I had back then?  For my 
shaman, the answer was a resounding yes, every level the pet was more 
and more capable of contributing to a fight, with my better and better 
buffs and slows... until at 49 I finally gave up doing any melee damage 
myself and just let the pet do the killing while I stood there getting 
hit and sucking up the damage while medding on my mount.  Does the 
chanter pet scale the same way?
