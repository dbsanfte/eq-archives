AH ok.. hmm so really it SHOULD even help my tnt then if it worked...
odd. Dug up some info on it which is kind of hard to find under
"umbra" but which I found under DPVS:

http://surrender3d.com/umbra/faq.html

 "Can I use dPVS with OpenGL / DirectX / my own 3D engine?
 Yes. dPVS does not expect anything from the rendering engine used.
Some special features however are available only if certain hardware
features exist. For example, usage of stencil models requires stencil
buffer capabilities from the rendering engine.

  Does dPVS require special rendering hardware?
  No. The library does not render anything, thus it does not need any
rendering hardware or rasterization libraries. Of course, in order to
visualize something, the user needs a rendering engine of some kind."


Etc, I could have sworn verant said some kind of hardware thing..
guess I did get it mixed up with T and L. Its odd then that I saw no
difference in turning it off if its bugged. Maybe I will renable it
again and see how I do on guild raids and such.

Ah this too in the faq:

  "Does dPVS support hardware occlusion culling? Doesn't HW culling
make dPVS obsolete in a few years time?
We have negotiated with various 3D hardware manufacturers. When
hardware occlusion culling is available, dPVS will support it.
Hardware culling will not make dPVS obsolete in any way. Only a small
part of the visibility-resolving process can be accelerated with
custom hardware."


Hmm from reading that whole thing I'm not getting why its not working
great then.. Verant messed it up? Basically on the whole, even going
back to old models and with clipping all the way down and with low
textures (and old textures in old areas) I have a HUGE frame rate hit
whether I have that umbra line in my eqclient.ini or not. If they did
this umbra thing right, however, it sounds like it should get a lot
better for everyone especially when I'm in VERY laggy for me now areas
like freeport.
