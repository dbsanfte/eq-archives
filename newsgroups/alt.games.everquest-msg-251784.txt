I'm saying that *in general* they are worth doing, but in *my* case I
became time flagged before I've gotten all my trade skills to the level
required for the 8th shawl, but this is due to myself slacking, not because
the quests aren't good.

If I had all my skills at 252 effective skill right now I'd do the Aid
Grimel quest, since it still good compared to time loots, but as I can't
be bothered to farm that much cash or components to raise them all quickly
I'll probably progress to some GoD stuff that makes it not worthwhile
before all my skills are viable by raising them slowly as I find some
components here and there.

I might start working harder on my tradeskills though and complete the quest
because right now it is a very nice earring.
