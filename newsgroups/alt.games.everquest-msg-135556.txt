I hope not.  I have 52 items for sale right now (OK, I have a mule up at
home while I am at work).

I saw a Centi Shortsword up for 5pp and I went to the vendor, it was long
gone (he only had 8 or 9 items for sale).  It was there until the vendor
logged out.

This morning, it looked like the inventories were being dynamically updated.
I sold a Glowing Velium Axe, and it no longer showed up when I did a search
for Glowing (but the Glowing Wooden Crook for sale did show).  Maybe the bug
was corrected with the last patch.
