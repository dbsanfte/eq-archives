What that means is that the weapon you are using has a proc...i.e. velium
shards.  No matter your level it will try and proc, but if your level is to
low it will not be able to and you get the message about your will; whereas,
if you are high enough it would be able to proc and hit the mob with velium
shards.  Right click on the weaon and it should tell you what the proc is,
don't know if they tell you level of proc yet.
