See my other post -- it exits by the "Office of the People"
in northwest N.FP.

...unless you take the *other* "evil people's tunnel outside
W. Freeport", in which case you'll end up in the tunnels
under *East* Freeport, with splits that lead to:

   1.  The Necromancer's guild.  (I think the SK's are in there too).
   2.  The E.FP newbie area outside the "south gate".
   3.  The Rogue's guild, which has further splits off to:
       a.  The secret wall in the basement of the storage
           room under the bar on the E.FP docks.
       b.  The underwater entrance/exit in the "bay" south
           of the docks.
