Although this is obviously where everyone tells you to go for good exp I'd
try and break out of the LoIO, OT, DL routine, if you can, try SoL (as you
obviously have it) Hollowshade Moore should be around your level, only
problem might be getting a group there as a it's Luclin it is not teeming
with players but far better chance of loot there. Paludal caverns you could
still scrape exp in as well, although you are getting a little high for that
zone. Can bind in Shar Vahl, off of Hollowshade.
