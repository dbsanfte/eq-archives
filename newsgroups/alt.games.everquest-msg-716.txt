Starting at level 12, iirc.

Nope, we get the far less useful Fizzle and Resist skill to our
spells.

Basically, a Critical hit is a random chance for a warrior (or ranger
using a bow) to double the damage of one hit.  This can be any hit
(and you'll quite often see crits that aren't any larger than a normal
hit) and the chance for a crit to go off is apparently based on
Dexterity.
Warriors also have the random chance when reduced to less than 2
bubbles of life (and thus in a Bezerker Frenzy) to land Crippling
Blows, which are apparently Critical Hits, only with the damge upped
even further, and a chance to stun added in.
