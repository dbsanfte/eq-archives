Whilst im sure your guild has players slighlty more mature and skilled than
your average PoV_dood, I bet even they got too many adds at times and had to
train/run to the zoneout.

I know what you mean about the morons in there, Prexus has more than its
fair share of them too residing in PoV, even the best groups can be easily
overwhelmed though.

We had an interesting one last night... a chanter pet (one of the golems)
was released when the chanters group had to evac.. 65 chanter buffs on it
(and they hit damn fast anyway) plus other buffs from their group - not sure
how it got agrod on us, but it killed the shaman and cleric in about 2
seconds flat (shaman is 5k hp too)

People training in the castle is particularly nasty too, mobs get messed up
agro when trained in there, you end up getting mobs warp onto you from
nowhere, and like 6 mobs kicking your ass

Im pleased with some of the wasteland changes (immune to snare and root)
seeing wizards, druids and necros kiting all over the groups there (and it
does get crowded) is ridiculous, this isnt DL, you had to pass a "test" to
get in there, so wtf are you acting like a total selfish moron

Pre-root nerf (about 2 days ago) I watched a necro starting with 20m kill 2
level 63 mobs one after the other (no delay, they were both in camp and he
just kept them rooted/snared while the dot took em down)..  wizards and
druids soloing level 68 mobs.. thats fucked up!

Or across the wastelands, or kiting vassels around the GY.. peoples
stupidity never ceases to amaze me

I was grouped with 2 guild warriors most of yesterday, and was starting a
cheal at 40%, with them living comfortably, towards the end of the night
they had to log and we got a warr (60+)from random_guild, I started a cheal
at 60% and even that was too late, ended up having to duck and use supernal
to keep him up

Here here!

No they dont assist.   When I killed rats on the way to Mavuin they were
shaman slowed, and I still needed the odd cheal -  so id figure no they
aren't soloable.

Enforcers rampage and flurry.. im not sure a 60 mage could oslo them :p

Agree, but king and queen (queen at least) is a very special fight.. not
your average level 64 mob.  Vindi is a better guide to a 64+ mob!
