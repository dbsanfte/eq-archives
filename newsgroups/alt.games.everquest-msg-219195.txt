The problem is that the shaman is also busy slowing the mobs, and hasting 
the melee with the stupidly low duration haste spells he gets.

I have done groups any number of times where I am the main healer, with a 
paladin as backup, they can be a blast to do, but, it's a lot of work.  
Last one I did was the CY in BoT.  We rocked, but I could not have done 
it without canni V and torpor.  The melees, the other 5 group members, 
had to make do with 50% group haste.
