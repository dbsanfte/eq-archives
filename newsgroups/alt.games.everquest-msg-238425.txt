My main is a 60 Shaman and I just recently dinged 60.  Checked the bazaar and 
most of the lvl 60 spells are 20k or more each.  This is on the Inny server.  
I've never had 20k in my life and the most I ever had at once was 10k and I 
bought a mount with it.  Right now I've got 7k in the bank and I am a heavy 
saver.  I don't buy much at all.  Looking for any suggestions on how others 
got their spells.  Do I just need to be lucky and get them as loot?
