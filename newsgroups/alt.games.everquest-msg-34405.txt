Sell binds, or find a tailor who wants some viscous mana made. You can
make a couple of plat per cast in either situation. You'll be bored to
tears, but I can't help you there. Maybe make the manas near a pond,
and fish while you're meditating.

Personally, I've never been able to understand this "always broke"
problem. I know that a lot of people run into it, but I've *always*
been able to afford all my spells within a level of when I can cast
them. In my opinion, the game is quite well balanced in terms of being
able to afford what you need when it's appropriate for you to have it.
