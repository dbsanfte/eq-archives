At least you can just click sow off and restart Selo's at the cost of a
second or two.  My paladin's L49 self-only haste buff costs 300 mana
(more than a bubble off the bar for a wis-challenged half-elven hybrid)
and is overwritten by the crappiest enchanter/shaman haste buff, which
has barely over half the haste and lasts maybe one-third as long.  I've
had to sit and med to recast Valor of Marr a couple dozen times so far
because I didn't flee fast enough when some friendly lower level caster
tried to help me out while I was soloing.  Can't bring myself to bitch
at somebody for giving me a haste buff tho.
