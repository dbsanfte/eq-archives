I started playing with my boyfriend almost 4 years ago now, just after 
EQ came out.  I started a druid got her to 50 (back in the old days), 
and have since played a cleric to 60, a warrior to 60, necromancer to 59 
and a monk to 27.  For a newbie girl, any non pet class would be ok, 
just make sure she reads up about her spells/abilities, and most of all 
.... be patient with her!! :)

Dont worry that shes not good at computer games, EQ was my first 
computer game, now I play just about everything AND I'm better than the 
b/f at most games :) (he really hates that)

Everquest has been alot of fun for both of us.  And for all you moaning 
women out there.... If you cant beat em, join em I say!!
