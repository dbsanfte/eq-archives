Ok, I understand that the person this is for probably doesn't read
this newsgroup, but I figured I'd give it a try.

A few days ago you passed by a dwarf on a corpse run. You gave me a
lot of nice stuff that I didn't notice at the time because I was only
concerned about finding my rotting corpse. I thanked you, but
considering what you gave me, I should have been a lot more grateful!
You are one really nice ogre!
