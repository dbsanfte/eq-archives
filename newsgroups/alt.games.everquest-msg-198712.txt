Each Twilight piece requires two or three items, one of which is usually
a jewel or gem, and one of which is usually a mark (looks like a rune). 
The jewels/gems are rare drops from random mobs in the quest zones 
(DSP/Twilight/Scarlet/Mons/Tenebrous). The marks and other pieces drop 
from specific unique mobs in these zones. There are some nice tables at 
www.taylir.com of what mob drops what piece and what it's for.

None of these pieces are NODROP and there are usually quite a few for sale 
in the bazaar. And you can sometimes find them on nearby NPC merchants.
