This works but Sony suggests only putting the files you have changed into
your skin directory as they have set it up so that if the file is not in the
directory it will look for it in the default skin directory.  The reason for
this is that if they modify and patch some of these files it is less hassle
for you if you haven't changed it, since then you don't have to move all of
the updated file into your newly created skin directory.  Anyway I hope that
makes sense.
