You didn't mention what you are using now.  A Fine Steel weapon is always a
good cheap
weapon if you don't already have better.  From there, you could maybe go to
a Bone Bladed Claymore,
or a Grobb Cleaver (a quest reward).  I would imagine a reaver would be out
of your range in your
teens, unless you have, shall we say...  a previous monetary supply...  I
also don't think you would
be able to use those weapons to full potential in the teens anyway?

I did the Helm of Hukulk quest, and Froglok skin mask quests, they're not
bad.  You could also try
Grobb Cleaver, although I havent done that one personally.  Both of the
previous quests are gotten
by talking to the SK guildleaders.

I hunted froggies... plenty of them around Guk, and even a little inside
Guk.  From there, I went and hunted the lizzies outside Cazic, and the
gators inside Guk...  no place like home!
