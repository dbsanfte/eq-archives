I think you're wrong - 
to get an AA for a flag you talk to an NPC, every time you tell him 
[stories] he gives you an AA, until you've told him as many stories as you
have flags, at which point he says something like "I've heard that story
already."  This is very like turning something in (IE - every time you 
tell him [stories], one of your flags is marked as turned in.  Then you ask 
him about [craft] and he gives you a charm.

Mine is pretty weak, I only have 1 flag (PoV/PoS), but it will go
up as you get flags, and there is no reason to think that you can't
get a flag and go back to him and tell him a new story about it.
