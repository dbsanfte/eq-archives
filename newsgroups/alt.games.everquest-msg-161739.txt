Ah, yes I can't see why people don't do the others? Spent last night 
failing trial after trial but what we did was put ourselves in line for 
exe and while waiting for our turn we'd go fail hanging a couple of 
times (no line at all there when there could be up to 10 groups for 
exe). Think I had like 10 trials yesterday about half of them exe other 
half was hanging. Didn't pass a single one of them tho.. We must've 
sucked badly. :) But we got about as far on hanging as exe so I wouldn't 
say it's that much harder. Keep MR up high though, spins hurt. Good fun 
though, and a few decent drops.
