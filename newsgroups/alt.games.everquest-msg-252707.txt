BB is the easiest in terms of difficulty, mob pulling, and targeting.
That is the overall consensus from FV.

Money from drops and vendor fodder are about all the same since all
themes sometimes have dungeons that drop crap. LDoN merchant stuff
varies with class (example, dont see why clerics would even bother
with BB since the good stuff are form Tak and Miraguls).
