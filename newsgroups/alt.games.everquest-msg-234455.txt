This is the crucial point for beastlords. My LDON groupmates got much
happier when I dropped down a couple levels in the proc-buff I put on the
warder. Costs a small amount of DPS but well worth it to virtually eliminate
mob-pushing.

Yea we can do that to some degree, but in LDON dungeons there is limited
room for manuevering. Depends on the dungeon of course -- this is easiest to
do consistently when it's a series of big rectangular rooms (e.g. Tak) as
opposed to long narrower spaces (e.g. Mistmoore).

But I'd never try to angle the warder to push into a corner or into a wall,
that's what others always complain about.

Also true. People often assume that its the pet doing the pushing when it
actually isn't.
