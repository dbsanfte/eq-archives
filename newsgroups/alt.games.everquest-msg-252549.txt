You'd be hard pressed to prove that the N.K. bridge has any real value, 
whereas it is easy to establish that platinum in game, and items in game, 
have a real value that people have established outside the game.

You never know with our court system.  The 50kpp can be shown to have an 
actual real world value in dollars (not a whole lot last I knew), so, it 
is possible.  I am reasonably certain that in the case of something 
purely in game like that, the courts would not have much interest in 
getting involved however.

This situation is clearly different from the original one however, where 
an exchange of money was agreed to for a service to be performed in game.
