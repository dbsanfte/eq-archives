Hello All,

Getting quite tired of the kill, kill, kill, level, kill, kill, kill,
level, bank then repeat aspect of EQ. Have done most of the newbie
quests on various servers and am looking for mid-level quests to do. I
care little for uber loot, coin or otherwise, but like the challenge of
a good quest no matter what the reward. Would like to see a discussion
of quests that people actually enjoyed, rather than just endured.
