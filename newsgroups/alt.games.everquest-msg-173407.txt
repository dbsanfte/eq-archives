The shrine guards don't enrage.. not sure if the DPS on them is any
different, but thats not the mobs I was fighting with this log.
Last times parses were in an area like you described, however (GMU+Primal,
avg 155 dps)

the parses:

No VoG/SoV?  240 = max?
Im not a ranger so don't know all the bows and arrows... those arrows sound
pretty good, the bow though.. well primal is nice and all, but its nowhere
near endgame (rant coming up)

See this is what pisses me off about rangers.. :)
A rogue using (potentially) the best poker (probably like top 3, with some
of the new PoP stuff.. but still ungodly) parsed at similar to a ranger with
an "ok" bow (no offence of course)..

A monk with the 2 best SoL weapons, V3 and AoBx2 + Avater parsed out below a
ranger using the top (or second) best bow in Velious...

Its good for me, because I group and exp with a ranger a lot (most my exp
groups have a ranger in).. but I still think AM3+EQ is vastly overpowered.
Imagine what kind of DPS you'd get using a Luclin or PoP end-game bow..
sickening

Btw did the rogue try Khals+Primal poker (or whatever offhand they use)...
RB seems a very unusual weapon for somebody wielding a weapon as uber and
rare as Khals
