They are single FACTION spells. IE if one next to that one was still KOS 
it was a different faction and casting it on that one would erase the 
benefit of the spell on the previous faction you just cast it on. It's 
possible that they changed it so the higher level versions can do more 
than one faction at a time, but it didn't use to work that way.
