I didn't read it that way. I don't think there's any magic  coding like
the TLC at work under there. It was just increased ZEMs for the dungeons
that are "appropriate to the thirty and under crowd". (e.g. befallen,
najena, dalnir, nurga, kurns, etc.) And in any of those you can find
mobs in some sections that are still giving xp well past thirty if you
want to hang out there. (Hell, when we were camping the jade prods last
week for our howling stones keys, we found four mobs in the LoIO sarnack
castle that were BLUE to level 55's! And I don't mean the chancellor
either. What the hell they were doing in that castle, I've no idea.)
