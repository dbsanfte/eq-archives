Only problem with this is the groups will have to move into more dangerous
areas so the SKs won't have to pull as far. SK' s FD casting time although
short will not work with 5 mobs on him and he can not run and cast. Monks on
the other hand with run 3 can usually run and get a couple steps ahead of
the mobs to FD. SKs pulling will result in more dead SKs and more Group Wipe
outs. Nothing against SKs but at times you have to FD on the run as you will
find out.
