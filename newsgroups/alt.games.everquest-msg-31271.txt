Checked this last night, since I'd done a crafted quest so picked up
some bread while I was there, then dropped it off with Gub when I was on
my way to the Rathe Mountains later...

I got about a third of a blue bubble at level 33. As opposed to not
noticing any movement at all if I give any to Innkeep James.

I expect it'll be nerfed on Tuesday though, along with the cash...
