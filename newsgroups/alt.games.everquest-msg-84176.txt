The only thing I can figure is that it was because of many simultaneous
petitions that would have gotten a GM's attention (and it was a GM,
not a guide), and there was time for somebody to actually witness
what happened between the times of the start of discussion turning to
arguement turning to train.  Nobody ever said they witnessed it,
but we were told the results while still waiting on body recovery, which
is pretty fast.

All 4 players were soulmarked for previous offenses.  The only reason I
know this is that as crummy as it was, I hate to see anybody banned.
I could have lived with suspensions, and told the GM this.  He said the
severity for the one (banning) was worse than the severity of the others
simply because there is a possibilty of this being a loose cannon and
his own group didn't even know it was going to happen.  The fact that
the folks that did it were known troublemakers being reported by groups
of folks in separate guilds with no records of causing trouble led to the
severe ban as opposed to a lighter punishment.

Probably because I was very nice, and very upfront that I'd hate to
be the cause of somebody losing an account permanently.  I can
handle a suspension, because maybe folks can learn something
from that.  Banning is almost like chopping your kid's head off because
he poops in his pull-up  on the first day of potty training.  That's the
only
reason I can see for being upfront about the trouble these guys had
been in in the past. Maybe he was trying to keep me from going off
on him for being so draconian with a first time offender, when it wasn't?

I wish I did.  I could count the number of  log files in my EQ directory
on one hand.  Matter of fact, the only times I've ever logged anything
was to actually parse for myself the effectiveness of my main
rogue's different weapon combinations.  99.9% of the time in EQ
I've had no reason to log, and look with logs posted by other folks
with the same dubiousness that I look at screenshots of unbelievable
stuff.  Why? Because if I was the "how dare you not believe me"
type, logs are just text files.  Grab a long weapon-parsing log to
get the format right, open it in Notepad and go to it.  I'd have an
"iron-clad" record that not only did it happen, but the GM gave me
personal tells about how he wants me to impregnate his daughter
and then gave me a full set of Kael quest armor and a necklace that
teleported me to any point in any zone with no casting time.  I wish
I did, but as with most logs I see online, I wouldn't believe it myself.
