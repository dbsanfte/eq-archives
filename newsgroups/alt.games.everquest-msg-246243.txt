One could always play the game...solo kill a mob, bind wounds...

Think about it... its a far more efficient use of your time. If it takes 
you 600 bandages to max your skill 99% of your time is going to be spent 
sitting on your butt pressing bandage vs 100%. A couple breaks to take 
some damage soling a blue mob periodically isn't going to take noticably 
longer and you'll pull a little xp out of the deal.
