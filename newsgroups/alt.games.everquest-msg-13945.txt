As a roaming high level druid, I tend to offer help quite a bit in my travels.
But...the spells I have memorized when I journey are, for the most part,
offensive in nature. I don't keep any heals, regens, shields, or buffs up. My
priority is my own protection first. I swap my last gem spot to buff myself.
Hence, offers of sow are mostly rebuffed, unless I have no place to go, for I
have to stop and mem the spell in question. When people ask for help, my
response is usually devastating the offending critter. I've hesitated once too
many times in my long career and have learned a live and angry PC, is still
better than a dead one. My point, if you ask for help, don't be surprised by
what is offered. We aren't always prepared to handle the situation the way you
would like it handled. As to your specific concern with the druid in NK, I
would have ensnared it. Playing a melee character to 53 has taught me all about
what kind of harm I can inflict on such players if I choose the wrong spell.
And the first words out of my mouth when I realize exactly has transpired is
usually an apology if warranted. My philosophy is there are always more
monsters to kill, and the time to find another is nothing next to regaining the
experience I MAY lose if someone trying to help hesitates. 
  In closing, and realizing hind sight is 20/20, when the caster in WC had
rooted your Fin, I, personally, would have stepped out of melee range and
healed or nuked it to finish. If you're a warrior, the former would be
bandaging yourself while you wait for root to break =)  

P.s You have to be pretty offensive in language to get knocked off my christmas
card list. =)
