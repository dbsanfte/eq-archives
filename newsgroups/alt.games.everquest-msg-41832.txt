All fingers point to it being the same one who organized this attack.

As for the threat clearly passing it has not.  They have names of other
associates of the hijakers who also received pilot training, and these people
have not been located yet.  There is no proof that this is truly over yet. 
Considering that this plot was hatched around the same time our embassies in
Africa were bombed.  That is when some of the Hijakers started their pilot
training.  Who is to say that they are through or that this wasn't just an
intermediate step before moving on to something larger.

While I agree that this was a problem and we are as a result of it basically
responsible for Saddam Husein and the Taliban being in charge of their
respective countries.  Much of the Iraqi military equipment was sold to them to
support the war that happened between Iraq and Iran.  The taliban was one of the
groups that fought against the communist regime in Afghanistan during the time
of russian occupation.

I agree that we need to use diplomacy in this matter, which is what we are
doing, we are courting many of our allies from the gulf war as well as others
who were not allied with us.  We are trying to get Unilateral support to
eliminate the threat posed by bin laden's terrorist organization.  I do somewhat
agree that our support of Israel has not won us any friends, and I don't always
agree with US involvement in other countries, however, despite being a democracy
here, we are not allowed to vote directly on our governments policies.  If you
hadn't noticed however, it's the US who for the last 10 years or so has been
trying more to get a cease fire and peace in the middle east.  We are the ones
who keep encouraging and bringing arafat to the table with the israeli's. 
Considering it was an israeli extremist who assassinated Rabin, who had almost
gotten the true cease fire going there, much of this conflict stopped.  There
are people on both sides in the Israeli/Palestine disputes who are in the wrong
and using Terrorism to try to achieve their goals.  Perhaps, and what countries
pledging support of the United States after this tragedy, are asking and getting
at least lip service assurances of is a multilateral, fight against terrorism
throughout the world.
