Seriously, I can't remember the last game I purchased without first trying
the ISO. I don't mind paying $100au for a decent game but be stuffed if I
will do the same for a crap one. They have Electronics Boutique nearby now
that offer a 7day customer satisfaction guarantee, but I can't imagine they
would be gracious about it.

Moi: "Hey man - this game bites ass. Money back please"

Pimply Git: "Sure, let's just hold up the queue for the next15 minutes
whilst I cheerfully process the refund..."

I still end up purchasing over a dozen titles a year, so the only losers are
Software Companies who produce the aforementioned assbiting code.
Boo-f'ing-hoo eh?
