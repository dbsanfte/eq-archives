    VI knows how these things are done, and if they don't they soon learn.
Here's a little story to illustrate:

    When you kill mobs to get flagged in Planes of Power, "a planar
projection" spawns. If you hail him, you get the flag. He depops fast,
though, so how can you make sure everyone (people who went LD, people that
need a res, etc.) get flagged? Well, a bard discovered you could mez the
planar projection and it wouldn't depop. So you could actually CotH folks to
the projection and flag entire guilds.

    The devs found out about this very quickly, and raised the magic
resistance on planar projections through the roof! So that's been nerfed,
right?

    Fast forward to our guild raid on Terris Thule. We kill her, guild ENC
goes to mez the projection, it resists, he tries five more times, all
resisted, then the ENC lands mez somehow! After I've gated out of the zone,
and as the ENC is looting his item from Terris (very nice Mana Preservation
IV ring), he brags in the raid channel "They're soooo smart raising the MR,
but they forgot about Rapture! It's unresistable!"

    That's exactly when NightmareB came down. Didn't crash, oh no. It was
brought down without warning, and back up within a few minutes.

    I know what we'll find next time we try to mez "a planar projection".
Unmezzable. And the enchanter? He hadn't had a character save yet, so he
lost the ring and the GM he contacted confirmed it won't be replaced.
