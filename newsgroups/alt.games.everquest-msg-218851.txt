It would take more than just changing the yaulps, they would have
to seperate the Paladin versions (and retrofit every single
Paladin character above L8) or you'd end up with Paladins way
out of balance.  You'll note that with Temperance and Aegolism
they gave Paladins seperate spells that are identical in every
regard except level at which they are received and duration
(Paladin versions are 60 minutes instead of 100 minutes).

I don't have a problem with classes having only marginally useful
abilities.  I do wonder about useless abilities tho.  For example,
knights get Disarm, but they get it fairly late and it is capped
at 75, I do not know of a single instance where a knight has disarmed
an opponent (and if they did I'd be ready to bet that it was a L50
disarming an Orc Pawn, or some such).
