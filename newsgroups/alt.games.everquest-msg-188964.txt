I'm surprised you were able to reach one.  I died on a CR next to the zone
wall and came back to get my body for a rez but my body wasn't there.
Luckily I only had the money I was going to pay the cleric for the rez on it
so I didn't lose much except for the xp.

I petitioned for 6 days straight, about 6 hours each day waiting for a
response.  No luck.  Damn GMs too busy eating chips and soda.  I miss the
old days when each server had a GM and you can actually got a response in a
few hours.  Now with this rotating GM server crap, it's almost impossible to
get a response.  Used to be that the petitions actually got saved before so
when you logged on the next day, it was still there and you would get a
response quickly.  I even got a response once even though I went to another
server back before they made the changes.

Oh well.  About 1-1.5 hours of xp lost because of that.
