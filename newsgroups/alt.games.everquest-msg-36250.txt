Correct, just get another player or character to get it (I assume this
is because you chose a religion for your enchanter? You may want to
consider re-starting your enchanter as agnostic; it's not necessary, but
you can go anywhere and do most all quests using illusions and alliance
spells. For some odd reason, even though NPC's are fooled by your
illusion, they can tell your religion...). If you plan on doing the
quest more than once, stock up.

Nope, all other pieces for the compendium are No Drop. However, I
suppose you could mutli-quest between several of your own characters
(just make sure it's your DE enchanter that turns in the last item).
