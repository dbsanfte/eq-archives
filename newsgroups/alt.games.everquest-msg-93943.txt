I am alllllmost 16 (can smell the breeze) and heres what I use:

Choke
Chaotic Feedback
Enfeeblement
Mesmerize
Memory Blur
Color Stun (or flux or whatever its called)
Charm
Tashan

This is provided that ive already misted myself and group members and
have shielding up.

If the tanks arent pulling or if they are safely beating up on one orc
i can pull another with tash and mezz him on the outskirts of battle
then use choke and chaotic feedback to help out with the damage.

Ive been using mem blur if someone is getting hit hard as this causes
the mob to stop for a second and gives them a chance to back out of
combat and let another tank take over.

If i'm getting hit i use the color spray to stun them so i can get a
chance to cast mezz or charm whitout them hitting me.

If tanks keep breaking mezz over and over just use charm instead.
Remember though that if the tanks are that brain dead then youve got a
problem when charm wears off so cast it again until youre oom then
zone or cross your fingers and hope one of the tanks will help kill
it.

Im trying to reach 16 in that god forsaken noobish hell hole called
oasis. WTF????? Ive played 6 characters up beyond their 30's so far
and ive NEVER seen oasis this bad. Im not talking about spectre trains
or sand giants roaming but the sheer dumb as dirt mentality of groups
these days. This is the luclin server im talkin about. Maybe its
because as an enchanter, I am primarily engineered to be a group
support person (or IMO the damn leader....who else controls so many
mobs so easily...hehe). Grouping with idiots is damn frustrating but
im loving the class as a whole. You are the most fragile but also have
the most power in your hand. I can imagine that at high levels a good
chanter makes the difference between uber xp group and a bitter TPW.
Until then im gonna stick it out cause a chanter below 16 is less
desirable (at least to the "SCREW SO-AND-SO CLASS...THEY SUCK...I DONT
WANT THEM IN MY XP GROUP" mindset) than even a wizard or necro cause
all they want is breeze.

/say Oh you are so mercifully free of the ravages of intelligence!
