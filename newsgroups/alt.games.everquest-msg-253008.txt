You may as well give up arguing with him. Never argue with anyone stupider
than you. You can never win that way, since they don't know when they have
been beaten.

In any case, I would suspect that if this were a different game like
Counter-Strike, he would argue the point of legality vs morality of using
'cheats' in the game.

In my opinion, buying plat online is the same as cheating, and I believe it
is wrong. When I play Counter-Strike, I may not have the best skill in the
world, but I have enough pride in myself not to cheat.

To sum it up: cheating = lack of skill
                     buying plat online = cheating

et cetera, ad nauseum
