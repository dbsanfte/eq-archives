You see it all the time. A very high level player deciding they want to 
roll up a new character and dumping 100kpp on them to start with. Then they 
take their uber druid and PL the hell out of the new character, jacking 
them up to level 30 or 40 or even higher I suppose in a very short time.

My question, and I ask it in all seriousness, is is it really worth it? I 
mean, don't you wind up with a crippled mid-level character that coudn't 
fend off a mob half their level? Doesn't it take an extremely long time for 
all skills to catch up? How can this be any more fun or time efficient that 
just levelling up normally with good gear?

What's the motivation for extreme powerlevelling?
