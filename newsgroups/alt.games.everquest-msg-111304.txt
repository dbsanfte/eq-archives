I've read all the replies so far and I have to add this for those assholes
who will inevitably say "mana is free," or "don't be a tightass" or
whatever.

Suggestion:  You only have to be nice once.  ONCE.  And even THEN you don't
really have to be nice.

MACROS ARE WONDERFUL THINGS.

Name one "SOW"

/say Excuse me %t, I really hate to bother you but may I have a SoW, please?

If you prefer to send tells, change /say to /ttell.

But don't ask for a sow if you can't see them.

As for that SK, Freeman, you're not helping by PLing that SK, and that's
exactly what you're doing.  He picked a primarily grouping class, encourage
him to find a healer to group with.   As for that Warrior, suggest he go
back to "his" server to continue his love of grief kills and ill manners.
