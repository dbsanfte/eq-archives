Once you figure in 2 boxers and multiple characters on one account
doing LDoN adventures, I'd be willing to guess that number drops to
under 3000 'people'. On Bristlebane, which tends to be one of the old
and crowded servers, 10 wins will put you somewhere around a 2200
ranking which is probably a better metric of player numbers.
