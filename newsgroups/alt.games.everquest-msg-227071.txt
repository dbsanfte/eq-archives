Oh oh, well sure then.

I'm relieved to find your real position wasn't as insane as the one I'd 
made up in my head.

Cleric without a cloudy potion?  Now thats insane (unless he's all out, 
that happens, the stupid things don't stack)

Yep, I'm aware of that from days in the Hole or Guk in my cleric's 
youth, trying to move a group of people who can't ITU themselves past 
some stuff that we don't want to (Guk) or Can't (Hole) handle; 
frequently the answer was "if ITU drops stop where you are and consent 
me after you die" Especially after getting Improved ITU, which lets me 
stop worrying about my own ITU ever dropping en route, the idea of 
finding a safe spot to recast and hoping that the person I'm casting on 
doesn't have aggro (casting on a person with aggro does them no good and 
puts me on the "also aggro" list even when I'm ITU'd up) gets really 
limited joy from me.

Splendid
