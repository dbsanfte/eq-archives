I'm seeing floating around FBSS is either 21% or 17%... saw it corrected
once but go figure, forgot it =P
the FBSS is a constant effect, lets just pretend it is 21, your weap with 43
dly would turn into 33.97
stacking mith haste with fbss... not sure, but I doubt it. Check that link
up there, I just skimmed through it, you might be able to get more out of it
Did this guy with the weighted axe have any other haste effects on? From my
understanding, you can get 1 item, 1 proc, and 1 player casted haste, and
they will all add up to the cap, which seems to rise post 50 since a bunch
of my post 50 spells are like.. 4% more haste every few levels *sigh*
