Here's the change they need to make to the EC orcs: when they die, the Orcs
should say "Aaarrrggg...my comrades in South Ro will hear of this and come
avenge my death!  They have nothing better to do, since no one ever goes and
bothers them, so they are just sitting around in their nearly half dozen
camps, bored with nothing to do!"

Maybe that would get some people to get off their asses and take a little
trip away from the over camped EC orcs. :-)
