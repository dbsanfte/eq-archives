These were very annoying; the augments had their weights listed, and 
were correct, but if you put them on an item, the weight of the item 
would increase by much more than the weight of the augment.  Mild 
nuisance for most of us, crippling for monks.

Good deal, having to look up every drop with a clicky on Allakhazam just 
to judge how useful it would be was annoying.

Thats interesting news, although I hadn't found healing pets to be a big 
problem anyway; in fact this was generally the tradeoff: nuking the mob 
was usually more mana efficient, but could get me aggro, while healing 
my pet was more costly but safer.
