My quest journal is constantly at the 50 quest limit, I wish they
would have set it higher.  OTOH then I would probably be at that
limit, what with the zillions of collection quests.

There are plenty of solo mobs for all levels, you just need to go to
the right places to find them (Antonica or Commonlands at level 13).
If you're the right class you can easily solo greep group monsters up
to at least 20 (I'm at 23 and can still handle them if I choose the
right ones), too.  People have said that guardians (the defensive
fighter class) can take blue ^^ group mobs up to the high 20s at
least, with good AC.

They're also adding a bunch of new solo quests next week, so maybe it
will be a bit more fun for soloers then, depending on what levels
they're for and what the experience reward is.

Umm, no use for multiple predators?  How about doing damage?  They may
not be quite as good as mages, but they deal out very respectable
damage compared to anything else and almost all that damage is instant
so stacking doesn't matter (and even if it wasn't, surely multiple
DoTs from different casters stack, or did they learn nothing from
EQ?).  I'd be more worried about the stackability of, say, bards
(specialised in group buffs) or rogues (the tanking scout).
