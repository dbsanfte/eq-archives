In all honesty, do you even really need to overcome the faction anymore?

This was an issue back in the Kunark days when people were leveling up in
the old world and kunark areas...  Velious largely ignored racial faction by
making Thurgadin non-kos to everyone (to start) and the other two major
factions only have slight racial / diety adjustments.  Shadowhaven doesn't
care what race you are, nor do Knowledge and Tranquility, the only PoP city
/ quest zones.

As a dwarven warrior, I have *yet* to find or hear of a quest worth doing,
where I could do it with beginning Agnostic Dwarf faction, that a Cazic
Thule Iksar could not do as well.  The warrior epic is faction neutral, any
combination can complete it without faction work.   Velious quest armor?
Both classes would need to do faction work.   Maybe it would only take 5 and
a half arena raids for me to become Ally to Skyshrine, where it would take
an ogre or lizard 6.  Big deal.   Coldain rings?   No faction issues.

So the Iksar loses the ability to run bard mail at level 1 (whee!) but gains
permanent regen and an armor class bonus.   Same with the Ogre penalty, but
gains Slam and the ability not to be stunned from the front.

Hell, it's not even an issue hunting in the old world anymore.   Used to
mean a lizard who hadn't factioned would have to run to Cabilis every time
he wanted to sell or bank.   Nowadays, you run to the nearest city and click
on a book and are immediately taken to a faction neutral Vendor / Bank zone.
Every city you might be KoS in has a book almost immediately next to it.
