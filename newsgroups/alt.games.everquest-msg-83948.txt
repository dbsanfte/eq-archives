Thank you!
You guys just made Norrath (and EMarr) a better place by reporting them.
Their own actions and attitudes got them banned.
Too bad the GM didn't let you get some loot for your efforts being spoiled

What guild was it?  I'm on EMarr most of the time, and don't mind knowing
what guild to avoid in the future when considering possible membership.
