Spawning in WoW is very fast, and it makes for a challenge on many quests.
Some are really bad, like the bloodsail buccaneers in stranglehown, where 
you have to kill 3 bosses each on a separate boat.

One annoying feature is that the quests often have several stages, and you 
cant share (for example) part 3 of a quest with someone who hasnt done part 
2.

That depends on the quest. Most are ok, but ive blown a lot of time on 
stupid quests with vague instructions. The really good quests are where you 
can combine several at once, like killing x trolls, and another quest to 
collect x drops off trolls.
Also 2 quests to kill 2 different monster types that spawn in the same area. 
1000 needles is a good place for this.
