Impossible. Utterly impossible. I went from two production servers, to
test, and the prices on each are markedly different. It is a source of
amusement on Test to see people bring prices from prod servers over. I
know, I was subject to that ribbing when I moved.

For a spider silk, your production costs are zip, there is no floor to
the price for silk. The competitior is your NPC vendor. You can get
5pp for silks, because the demand is high, and there are few people
selling below that.

Prices vary from 5gp to 5pp, and everyone has a pain threshold. If I
were to make money from them, I would hunt them and sell them cheap
(1pp) hoping to move them fast, then before I go to sleep change the
price to the 5pp mark. If I have them in the AM I lower the price, and
restock.

No way Eqprices can keep up with that. I have seen a fishing grub for
100k. How can you tell if someone bought that?
