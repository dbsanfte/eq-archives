Really, it's not that hard.  How many orange con solo mobs do you have to 
kill in EQ2 at a given level, compared to how many light blue con mobs 
you would have to kill at an equivalent level in EQ1.  That is the 
question, pretty simple.  I play both games, and can offer an answer 
actually...

Orange con solo mobs in EQ2 are probably equivalent to high dark blue con 
mobs in EQ1 in xp given, if not slightly higher.  At level 20 I was 
getting about 2% xp for 3 solo white/yellow/orange mobs.
