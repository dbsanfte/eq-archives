Among them

Frost Comet (540 mana, 2100 dam cold nuke for Wizards)
Change - renamed "Kind of Cold Comet"  Hehe, someone was reading
the wizard boards.

Interesting - the Nec, Bst, Mag Ward/Guard/Protection of Alendar have
the same effect in slot one (unknown #163) as Break and Cleave and the 
message for them is "Your attacks break through the target's defenses."
Makes me wonder if it's some sort of strike through buff for pets.

Necros and Shaman are looking at 4 tick, magic/curse based dots with
no initial DD.

Wiz/Mag get something called Reflect/Reflection of Druzzil.
