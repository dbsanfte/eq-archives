So it becomes the motto at 10 instead of 1 or 2, why is this worse?  At
least at 10, they have learned quite a bit more about the game, and are
better equipped to go back and get that corpse on their own.  Doing your
first corpse recovery at 10 is going to be a lot less of a panic than
doing it at 1 or 2, for true newbies.
