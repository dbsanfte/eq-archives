Everything you can into stamina, cause there's just NO way to raise that 
easily at early levels (especially with the economy on test).  I just 
rerolled Taellaar because at level 40, he's still only at 91 sta, has 
several slots with crap equipment just for the sta, and a lot of fights 
these days are outlasting my stamina.  After my pleasant surprise on 
Test, finding out about the lovely starting stats a barbarian gets, how 
could I resist? ;)  The extra points - *shrug* I put mine into str cause 
I like the big backstab numbers.  Everybody has a different point of 
view, though.  Just look at what the other stats give you and decide 
which one is more important to you.
