A) Go to N Ro.  Find the dock.  When the raft shows up, get on.
It will take you to Iceclad ocean.  Two choices:
A1) wait a bit and it will start moving, stop again near a little
sandy island.  Get off, cross the island, wait for the boat.  That
boat has only one stop, the dock near the igloos. From there
it is possible to walk to the rest of velious, if you are good at
hopping from one ice floe to the next.
A2) Swim for it.  Its a big zone, but hardly every anything in
the water.  If you have levitation and SOW so much the better.

B) get a port to Iceclad.  Note that the ring you port to is a death
trap, try to have either SOW or Invis or both on before you
port in, and leave the ring immediately.  If you are with a group
and plan to fight in Iceclad, at a minimum run straight out of the
ring to the shore to wait for everyone to finish zoning in.

Once you get to Great Divide you can pick up a tooth lying
on the ground in the ring there, and then can get ports to
that zone instead.

You can do the same in Wakening Lands and in Cobalt Scar,
but both of those are even better death traps than Iceclad,
at least until you stop being KOS to Claws of Veeshan
faction.
