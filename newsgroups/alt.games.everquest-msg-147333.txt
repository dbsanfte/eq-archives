Nope, the 'taxi' channel is called 'port' on many a server.  And on Ayonae 
Ro, there just isn't one.  But we still have a 'bazaar' channel.  On other 
servers it was called 'market'.

There is no way to list channels.  Ask someone on your server if there's a 
channel for such and such.  There seems to generally be a class channel, 
ie, 'wizards:graffe'.
