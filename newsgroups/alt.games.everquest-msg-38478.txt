That's easily corrected.  If the timer expires on the kill group's
exclusive loot rights, the items disappear.   That's not very
difficult for the server to handle at all.   Concerns about the
loot disappearing before a roll due to multiple pulls, etc. can
just be handled by increasing that exclusive rights timer.

That takes care not only of ways to get around the TCC but also
gives VI an out from any ninja-loot problems as well as a way to
manipulate end-game (and epic) group composition.  You just
camped Ragefire for 142 hours and weren't in the kill group?
Better get some sleep and try again....
