How does that affect the feel of the size of the world?  I spent a lot of
time comparing areas in EQ and DAoC one weekend, and found that areas of the
same size *felt* a lot bigger in EQ, and that seemed to be a combination of
two things: EQ had a lot more narrow long areas as opposed to most DAoC
areas being square, and zoning makes things feel bigger, for some reason.

Excellent.  "Sense Heading" is one of the dumbest things in EQ.  EQ
characters are trained adventurers, yet start with less navigation skill
than the average Earth girl scout.

Do they still have endurance (or whatever the one that is not health or mana
in regular EQ is)?  Or did they just merge mana and endurance into one?

Do you lose XP on death?  If you do lose XP, can you lose a level?

Is there much chatting?  I assume you can get a keyboard for the PS/2...do
most players seem to have done so?

Is there much random grouping, or are most groups like the ones in the TV
commercial (groups of people that know each other in RL)?

Is there a good interface to quests?  I found EQ quests annoying, because it
is annoying to try to take notes when I'm playing in the dark (and playing
in a well-lighted room makes the game less immersive) and even more annoying
to try to read them.  As annoying as that was...it would be even more
annoying sitting in my beanbag playing a console game. :-)
