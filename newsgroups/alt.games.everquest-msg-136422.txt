    We just might, soon. People with VT keys are getting impatient to see
the zone, and he's in the way. ;-)

    900 damage? My level 30 mage could eat that and still be at 50 HPs. And
mages do have a health regen self-buff line, although I doubt it's that
good. If he just mods once per pull, the 300 damage should be regenerated
back by the next pull.

    I'm quite good at ignoring everyone else. You have to be on 90 person
raids where everyone feels the need to fill every channel with spam. One of
our wizards even has hotkeys that mock this - "O'KIELL'S RADIATION >> 2 pt
DS << on TARGET!!!"
