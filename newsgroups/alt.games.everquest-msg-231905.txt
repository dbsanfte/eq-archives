Well, given that, different people will value their money very 
differently, depending, at least in part, on how hard it was for them to 
obtain it.  Thus, what to you seems to be price gouging, to them is a 
perfectly acceptable price, else, they wouldn't pay it.

If someone is purchasing the pelt at the price set, then, to them, it 
must be worth the amount they are paying, else, they'd go farm it 
themselves.

Different people value their time differently.  It's really quite simple.  
It's only price gouging, if they have no alternative but to pay the 
price, so long as the alternative exists for them to go out and get their 
own, then, they are setting a value on their time.
