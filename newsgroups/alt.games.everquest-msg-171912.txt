That's a reasonable expectation.  Even so, I'd be very surprised if
you said that you're unwilling to go along with a test of alternative
tactics by a group member who's being upfront about what he's trying
and why, assuming you hadn't already seen the same thing attempted by
somebody competent with poor results.  I still fail to see how your
experience with inexperienced/unskilled group members in any way
validates the actions of ignorant/incompetent group leaders.
