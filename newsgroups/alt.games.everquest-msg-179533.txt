Take notes, kids, the above is what what people do when they know their 
wrong and can't admit it.

No one is bashing you, you were asked to cite what you based your facts on.  
Pretty simple.  You did your typical response and lashed out and when you 
were given examples of why your "facts" can't be taken as gospel, you had 
to lash out more.

He never claimed ANYTHING.  He ASKED about price increases and ASKED if the 
last increase boosted their profits.  And you understood he was asking when 
he did it because you answered - answered with "facts" whose origin you 
can't cite.  Someone mature would have admitted they were speculating when 
asked to cite their facts that weren't facts.  Instead, you act like your 
normal self.

>I notice the only ones chanting for *ME* to cite are the jackass who
>like to jump on me every chance they get. Get over yourselves.

Here's a clue: look at how you end most of your posts.  Hell, most of your 
paragraphs.  You constantly put people down.  And you wonder why you get 
"picked on" when you act the way you are.

You're basically a condescending asshole who takes every opportunity to 
bash on people.  You reap what you sow.
