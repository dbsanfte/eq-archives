I soloed an Iksar Shaman to 51.  It was a breeze after trying to solo
an Enchanter!

Levels 1 to about 20 in Field of Bone.  Pull with best DOT, melee and
cast DD's until dead.

20 to 30 in Lake of Ill Omen.  Pull with DOT, root, Dot & DD.  (Remember
poison and disease DOTs stack.)  When root breaks either re-root or
melee and cast DD's until dead.

30 to 33 in Overthere.  Same as above but avoid melee.  :-)

34 get pet!!!  Park pet in FM valley.  Pull with best DOT, sick pet.
Run backwards as pet pounds on bad guy.  Reapply DOTs when needed,
apply DD's to taste.  Don't root or baddy will kill pet.

34 to about 47 in Overthere.

47 to 51 in Firiona Vie fighting giants.  Pretty much same strategy.

Have fun!
