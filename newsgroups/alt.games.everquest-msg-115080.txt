So what do you call changing tag lines on every post
as well as informing a far wider audience of levels ~and~
activity for a variety of characters?   In for a ounce, in for
a pound, etc etc etc...

Leveling, even within a RP context, is important.   Viewing
each level, with the opportunities for self-growth (new skills,
increased effectiveness, etc) isn't any more /ooc than simply
taking the time to scribe (and cast) a new spell or anything
else.   And, at least within that same RP context, it's entirely
arguable that "Ding" is entirely the same as shouting "Eureka..."
And that particular shout might be 'immortal' rather than
just the just the recipient of a few scattered 'gratz' shouts...

/point say looks at the meaningless self promotion reaching a
wider audience than running to EC, GFay, Oasis, LoIO, OT and
DL and shouting 'Ding' in each....

/em doubts anyone has ever done that for anything less than
level 60 or an epic and probably not even then...
