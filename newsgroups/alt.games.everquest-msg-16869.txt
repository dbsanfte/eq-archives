Females seem to get more free stuff too.  Don't ask me why when guys KNOW 
there are guys out there playing girls :)

(Oh and while we're on the subject, everybody keeps calling me 'he'.  
That should be 'she'.)

I have a friend who plays male and female characters, and he *definitely* 
gets more attention whenever he plays female characters.

(Although once playing his bard, he was doing the accelerando song for 
our group, and some ditz came up to him and begged for a SoW :p)
