Heh, anybody up for a pool?  :-)

Seriously, I'm a complete neophyte regarding EQ-related issues, but I 
suspect that how far in the future an EQ-only usenet group will be viable 
depends largely upon how much SOE continues to support it.

If they're committed to regular content addons, upgrades, etc., for the 
forseeable future, then that's one thing.  If not . . .
