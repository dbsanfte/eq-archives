What a bunch of Unmitigated Crap.

What they did to chanter NEEDED Doing. The only "Nerf" we experienced was 
that charmed pets IN OOW ZONES ONLY have had thier DPS halved.

What does that mean ? All it means is that we wont be soloing for insane 
amounts of Exp in OOW, nor will we be trivializing encounters by charming a 
mob and letting the rest of the group support the mob.

Theres PLENTY to do as a chanter post 65. CC is a must for a lot of places, 
Slowing is more required than ever for oow level mobs. Atm were the ONLY 
Class that can reliably pacify 66+ mobs ( aside for level 70 clerics that 
have actually gotten placate ).

Theres still plenty to do other than your "travelling buff bot". If thats 
all YOU can find to do post 65 then you must be a piss-poor chanter.
