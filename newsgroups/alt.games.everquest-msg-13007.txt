	I didn't say they were completely useless, I just said there wasn't
any reason to have more than a couple on an event. In groups, there's little
or no reason to have them. In Kunark, almost all our pulls were done by
rogues or warriors with great effect. It was only in very small groups with
low level people that I'd pull. Same goes for Velious.

	I really only pull on Vindi, Dain, North Wing TOV, and Velk. The
rest can be handled by warriors and rogues with at least the same effect,
and typically better because of the reduced aggro range from a warrior's
massive HPs, coupled with longer range with Archery. Javelins are damn
nice, but weigh too much for me to use them frequently, and are a PITA
to make.
