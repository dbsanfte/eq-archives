Ok, I killed him with my Troll last night. Not intentionally to answer
this question...... he just came running out and fearlessly (stupidly?)
attacked me on my way to the bank. Lowered three factions. The first one
listed was gemcutters, so I'm not sure if that makes it his "primary"
faction (i.e. the one you need to raise to not be KOS with him) or not.
The second two were both other A'Kanon gnomie factions. It also raised
one that I didn't recongnize.

And yeah, for his level the little bastard either has massive regen or a
ton o' HP because it took my level fifty-one better than two minutes to
beat him to death. Didn't really scratch me, though, and as others here
have pointed out, the guards didn't come to his defense.
