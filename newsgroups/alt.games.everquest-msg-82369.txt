Each set of software comes with an account code, this is what lets you
create and login to an account. You will have to have one account for each
computer you wish to play AT THE SAME TIME. So, If you have 2 accounts, you
COULD install it on all 4 computers, but you'd only be able to play two of
them simultaneously.

Well, as I stated before, you have to have a code (one per software pack) to
get an acount, so assuming you but 4 sets of software, you can install it on
each computer and setup 4 accounts. that would let each comptuer play at the
same time. You will be able to access all 4 accounts from each computer...
EXCEPT if you have SoL on only a couple of PCs. If an account is enabled for
SoL, it CANNOT be accessed from a PC that does not have SoL installed.

No, but if you buy the Trilogy (recommended) then you will WANT to install
the expansions. Each Expansion includes several locations to adventure in...
now you might think, "well, I just won't go there". But let me tell ya,
nothing sucks worse that finding a great group and having someone say "Hey,
I know a GREAT place to hunt, lets all go there!" and its one of the places
you didn't install. SO, install the expansions :)
