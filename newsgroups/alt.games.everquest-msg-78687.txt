Pullers that over-use the eye are poor pullers.  It's just too slow.  I've
yet to run into a mob that summons after a single shuriken hit.

Simple fact of high level pulling, *especially* when using an eye, is that
you have to know what's coming for you before you take it back to the raid
force.  Send a necro puller into Halls of Testing with an eye of zoom and I
can tell you exactly which mob you'll wipe out the raid trying to pull. 
Why?  Because you get 2 or 3 and have to pop-n-drop at least once to split,
and doing a pop-n-drop with a necro's hp and wurms/wyverns that 1k HT and
warp on top of you for a quad 350...  g'luck.  Necros aren't "bad" pullers,
they're just not "good" pullers and can never be "great" pullers. 

Shadowknights can actually be decent for certain pulls, but lack of
stonestance and mend and fizzles, and channeling, and not being able to
feign while stunned and not being able to feign while moving...  they're not
gonna take the place of monks.  :)
