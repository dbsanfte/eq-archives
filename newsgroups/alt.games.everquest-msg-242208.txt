How about discussing it without a flamewar?

Tha faq was a good idea then, and it is a good idea now, and for
exactly the same reasons.

You might like to remember that for some people this newsgroup is not
only their first online source of information for EQ, but also their
first foray into the Usenet minefield.

There was no *real* criticism of the faq in the days when I posted it,
(in fact, it received quite a bit of praise), although there were a
few who let their personal feelings colour their judgment towards it.

As you have, by conflating the faq with the newsgroup persona of Taras
Bulba.

I accept any criticisms you may have of Taras Bulba, and will not
answer any of them.

But if you have any criticism of the faq that I produced, then I am
more than willing to answer. 

So, did you have anything specific in mind?
