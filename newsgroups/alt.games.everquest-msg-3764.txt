I hate when people don't tell you a price cause they usually have a price in
mind.  SO i say something like 'so if I were to offer you XXpp what would
you say?"  usually they laugh at me and I say how much about are you wanting
for 'item'  ... There are still things that I don't know the price one (lots
of items) and I don't mind people asking me.....
