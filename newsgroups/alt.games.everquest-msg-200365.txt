Well, if you want it cast on you, it has to be worth the time the enchanter 
spends sitting in Nexus or wherever casting it.  If, everyone were to 
decide it's not worth paying for, well, then enchanters would stop being 
KEI vendors, and the only way to get it then will be to either find a 
friend to cast it on you, or offer even more money to an enchanter to cast 
it on you and/or your group, or group with an enchanter with KEI.

Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing all depends on your feelings 
about KEI, but, it would change the availability if it became not worth the 
time of the enchanters to sit around and sell KEI.
