That would certainly be an improvement, but not a panacea. You'd still 
have to deal with the next Tim McVeigh, the next Ted Kaczynski, and the 
next time the Anthrax Mailer decides to, well, go postal. And also with 
all those whose beef with the US is not about American troops per se, 
but third-party troops financed with US money.

I understand that you'd very much like terrorism to be a simple problem, 
that could be solved by throwing heavy ordnance at it, or that you could 
turn your back on. Unfortunately, it isn't a simple issue, and it 
doesn't have simple solutions. Trust me on this, we Europeans have been 
dealing with terrorism a hell of a lot longer than you.
