Like what?  Be specific, use small words.  Does this mean softening the
current AC cap? That would be nice.

No no no, thats wrong.  Don't make it easier for plate classes to get
out of the way, make them more able to withstand the blows they
do take.  More dodge?  Feh.  AC that works!

That makes sense, at least, although some will question rangers getting
better at getting hit... they aren't really a "getting hit" class, after all.

And this new spell costs what to cast?

This one they tell you the cost for... cause its not too bad.

How did you change it, though?  Details.  These patch messages are SOOOO
spotty.

Typo?  Or one of the most annoying "fixes" to come down the pike?

With what?  Never heard of this buff.

That was a bug?  I thought it was a feature to reward the insane archers
with Glance and ludicrously long range bow and arrow.

Why?  Seems like a waste of time, not like we can do anything useful
with this information... well maybe its nice for that two minute selos.

No more Beastlord CHeal? Sucks to be them.. but didnt' you always
suspect this was a bug?

Thats ok, that part was always incredibly lame.  Oh, I zoned, but I still
have my pet.. course he's level 5...

AH, no quick and easy recharge eh?

Good, no more clutter.  If you want to leave a body around for some
reason, just leave junk on it, no big deal.

Took too long to do that.

But level 60 warriors will continue to suck like they do now?  Why on
earth would you not fix level 60s, just everyone else?
