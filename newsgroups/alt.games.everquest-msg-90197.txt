As a general rule, I advise all monks to train ALL weapon skills and keep them
maxxed.  At higher levels, the 2hb weapons begin to reach ridiculous ratios
(38/40 is my current weapon).  The main difference is situational.  When
soloing, use whatever combo will yeild the most damage or effects.  When
grouped with a real tank, use what yields the least aggro (usually 2hb).  HtH
is good to keep up because it's your default backup (you can fight and gain xp
and loot even on a corpse run and some bozo can't disarm you in PVP).  Bottom
line, sweat more now, bleed less later.
