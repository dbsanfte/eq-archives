Faster than that -- the top horse is as fast as a high-level
Bard, which makes high-level SoW look sluggish.

No.  No speed-affecting buffs make any difference when
you're on a horse.  The horse is itself a "speed buff", and
it overrides the others.

Yes.  As long as you're not a) moving, or b) have your
auto-attack key on.

No, because then you'll be moving, and thus not medding.
However, every time you stop for a moment or five to stare
at the mob, or whatever, you'll be meditating, which is
pretty nice -- those little bits of time can regen a
surprising amount of mana all together.

Maybe it's because I'm a dwarf, but I'm barely any higher
on a horse than not.  The main drawback is that the horse's
head blocks part of my forward view, not my actual height.
