Personally, I think Dirtbag should be reserved for use as a title to be 
applied to those who demonstrate that they are deserving.

On a related note, around 2 years ago on Tunare server I knew a troll 
warrior named Scumbag (which I thought was a perfectly fine name for a 
Troll character).  He was forced to change his name by a GM, which I 
would no doubt have forgotten by now if it weren't for all the NPCs who 
will call you a Scumsucker when suitably provoked.  Apparently sauce for 
the goose (Scumbag is offensive coming from a player) is _not_ sauce for 
the gander (Scumsucker is just peachy keen coming from Verant/Sony).
