I went back to DL to see if the update had added a mob needed for
a task I'd been given (even though I've since ditched the task, I'd
like to know if it's been fixed).  Instead I found almost all the
normal mobs gone.  Lanys T'Vyl herself is near the passage to the
Lost Valley, with some dark elf Generals and a small army of undead.
Al'Kabor is near the FV zone, with another army.  Nobody else was in
the zone but me.

Nobody in PoK or guild or various other channels seemed to know what
was going on.  Of course, there's not a lot of folks on at this hour.

Oh, and the new quests in Lavastorm stopped working, too, which was
a tad awkward.

I'm off to bed; maybe there'll be more information when I get up. :-)
