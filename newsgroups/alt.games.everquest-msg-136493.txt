Just wondering... I made two purchases in the bazaar for my wizard this
weekend. Neither of them were *amazingly* good deals, but I found the
price satisfactory compared to what I'd seen in pre-bazaar days and
picked them up.

I purchased Spider Fur Gloves for 400 plat and Ring of the Frost Spiders
for 250.

Anyone else been getting any nice deals or improvements for their kit?

My kit has been upgraded from (IMO) "Jakiss's Crappy Wizard Gear" to
"Jakiss's Somewhat Less Than Totally Crappy Wizard Gear".
