He's arguing in context. You are saying "an object" like "a glass" or "a 
sword". He is arguin "an object" in OOP lingo.

In programming, while everything ends up being data(in the context you are 
using it), there is "data" as a part of the program (meaning the content of 
data structures). Saying "it's all data" is like saying "it's all language" 
when comparing similes and metaphors.
