You know what would be really, uh, interesting?  If everything the first day
or 2 was only dropping cloth.  I heard when Kunark came out the Necklace of
Singularity and other nice items were dropping from easier then intended
mobs.  Similar things with Velious.  Some claim it was intentional to "draw"
people to the new world.  Sure would be different to have all the "me-first"
style powergamers hit the new zones and get squat.

But, to answer the question, yes there will be problems day1.  There is just
WAY too much stuff going in at once to get it all right.  Thats why they
have 300,000 testers that will hit it at once =)

I'm still getting it though
