I have 2 pcs at home that are used for playing everquest, when my gf
is over we play together at my house.  When she goes home she "trys"
to play on her pc at home. This is where it happens.  Its like clock
work, after ~30 minutes of play time she will get the black screen of
death and it will say the infamouse "You have been disconnected" I am
going to call her broadband isp provider tonight, but I doubt that is
the problem, since I have the same isp at my house.  Im thinking it
must be somthing on her end, but what?  Maybe some software running in
the background, but she says there is nothing.   Anyone ever heard of
anything like this?  She does have a wireless router running from her
cable box to her pc.  She is not using the wireless, but a laptop
does. I believe it is a Linksys router. Im kinda confused and lost,
thanks for all the help in advance.

Take care

Halve
