If someone asks my low level characters for a sow while I'm playing I tell them
this:
I'll be done fighting in about half an hour and will be buffing/healing/sowing
at the *zone / bridge / whatever* for awhile after that.  Could you please find
me then?
-OR-
Try this:  take the next mob, get it to half health, then ask the crappy begger
to finish it off so you can med up for his sow.  
I find both work equally well.  
One way I keep my mana, the other allows me to "save" that mana, thereby
allowing the "required" sow - and I still get the experience.
I found while doing gnolls there were players that KEEP COMING BACK for sows
and heals once you help them out...  This technique works quite well there...

>What irks me is that
>everyone EXPECTS you to sow them whenever they want it.
