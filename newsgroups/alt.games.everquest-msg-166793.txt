Only if you focus exclusively on the Bazaar. In the Everquest economy, many
items, in fact the best ones, are no-drop. The "state" has intervened.

A truly free market is undesirable as a model. There must be intervention to
prevent, for example,  people selling stolen goods, atomic bombs, their
children's organs or their children. You can't do those things in EQ, but
selling accounts or equipment for real money on Ebay will get you banned by
SOE. In real life if not in EQ, there must also be mechanisms to suspend or
moderate trading in extreme situations; we learned from hard experience that
markets are not always self-regulating. The hands-off approach does not
always work.

That's a very big assumption that disregards the dark side of human nature.
Peaceful anarchy is unnatural and short-lived, given bullies and sociopaths.
You cannot argue that capitalism is the original state. As I said, trading
existed a long time before the invention of capitalism.


If Everquest is a "living ad" for anything, it's for a planned system with
constant tinkering due to unforseen consequences. SOE has managed to attract
and keep hundreds of thousands of players to the game.

I still don't believe that Everquest is a showcase for any kind of economic
or political system.
