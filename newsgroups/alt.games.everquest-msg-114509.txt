The recent thread on the volume of the DING went off on a tangent regarding
people who shout DING!.  My usual response is to /shout "DING! Level 1 !  I
am sooo proud!"  2 times in 10 I'll get someone who shouts "But you start at
level 1".  Most of the time we get a few /ooc comments about people's need
for feeling good and getting congratulated for progressing.

The other day, I made a Human Warrior and ran out to EC.  I shouted "DING!
Level 1!  I am sooo proud!  I plan on going out in the world and making my
parents proud and show them I can make it on my own."  I got a tell about 1
minute later that asked me where I was because he had something for me.  He
shows up about 2 minutes after that with a full suit of banded and a Fine
Steel 2h Sword.  You could have knocked me over with a feather (it was too
heavy to wear all that.  I wasn't used to it.)
