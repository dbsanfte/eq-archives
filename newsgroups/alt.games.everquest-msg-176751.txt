1. You gave your account details to someone so only have yourself to blame

Or

2. You play sometimes in a public environment like a cybercafe. Happened to
a guildmate of mine where someone was watching over his shoulder as he
logged in and stole his stuff. GM did get involved as the person doing the
stealing was stupid and just passed the stuff from that account to his other
so the items were traceable and the stealers account was banned.

or

3. You bought the account off someone else and they retained the details and
logged on their old account and stripped you, or a friend of the original
owner did same.


No matter what people whine about, No one can hack a password and account.

Sorry to hear you lost your stuff. With the amount of time I have invested
in my characters I would just quit if same happened to me.
