	For an alcoholic, that is exactly what it is.

	Alcohol is in some ways worse than "hard drugs", because it is insidious.
If you mess with heroin you know, up front, the stuff is going to screw you
over.  But a person can develop a drinking problem and not realise it until
his life collapses.

	Most of them quickly become drunks or junkies shortly thereafter.

	No, it's to say that the stuff is dangerous.  Everyone has different
thresholds for alcohol tolerance.  Some people can belt it down daily with no
ill effects (at least in terms of addictions; what happens to their livers is
another matter), some get wasted after one glass of wine, some become
alcoholics from purely "social drinking".

	Alcoholism, like all other addictions, is not a matter of self-control.
It is not a matter of willpower or strength of character or any other such
thing.  It is a matter of biochemistry.  If you have developed an addiction to
alcohol then you may not drink it.  Period.  Full stop.  Many people will
drink the stuff all their lives and not have a problem, but there are some for
whom that simply won't be the case.
