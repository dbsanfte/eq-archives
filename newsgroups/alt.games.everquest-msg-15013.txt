Indoors, the best pullers either 
a) can move without being seen in order to investigate chain aggro.
b) know the zone and how aggro will chain and pathing will aggravate

Ergo

Best puller in a dungeon is not the warrior, ranger, sk, monk, it is
either the guy who knows the dungeon, be he druid wizard etc or it is
the rogue who can move silently to interpret the chaining, and pathing
will still throw you off.

The two most deadly things in any dungeon, are running too soon, and not
running soon enough.

Breaking back in on an evac that was winnable, is just as bad as CR to
the bottom of the dungeon.  These are things that you learn quickly, be
it unrest, runnyeye, Permafrost or Paw.  Runnyeye is a great place to
learn.  There are Wandering death traps, and possible over or near
over-pulls.
