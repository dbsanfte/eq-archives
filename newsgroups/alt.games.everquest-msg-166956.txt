The people you refer to are.  And when you take their attempts to
rationalize their behavior at all seriously you are playing along,
whether or not that is your intent.

That is true, but irrelevent.  If you reject their rationalizations
on the basis of SOE's published "rules" extraneous factors like the
existence of the FV server have no impact.  "Poopooskidmarks Uranus"
is offensive and in violation of the published naming policy.  Period.


> And I do think they believe they're justified.


The world has no shortage of people able to convince themselves of
the "truth" of their own bullshit.  These same folks will quickly
adopt, and convince themselves of the truth of, an alternative
rationalization in support of their unchanging behavior just as
quickly as they are able should they be successfully disabused of
their current self-justification.  That sort of fickleness falls far
short of my definition of "true believer".

That's a fair criticism or what I wrote.  The idea I failed to get
across is that the folks you are complaining about are, for the most
part, trying to deceive you (and, in some cases at least, themselves)
as to the motive(s) for their behavior by claiming justification on
the basis of superficial rationalizations .


> I'm making an observation.


Not strictly true, when you wrote:
/quote
And they feel they're perfectly justified.  SOE gave them that
boldness when they marked one server as "Roleplaying Preferred".
/quote
you were engaging in analysis (i.e. expressing an opinion as to
the cause of the "problem").  Richard contradicted your analysis
with the observation that the "problem" predated the FV server.
I went beyond Richard's observation with my own analysis, then
you reiterated your belief that it was somehow important that the
existence of the FV server provided a basis for those who choose
to rationalize their willfull violation of the naming policy.  And
now you're back again with "I think...", not exactly the words I
would choose to express an observation.

Unless the people you are dealing with differ greatly from those
I've known, what's important to them is not whether their protests
are valid, but whether they can convince you that they're valid.

Humans are competitive social animals, "STFU I can do as I please
because [insert rationalization here]" is a pretty normal attitude
among adolescents.  Having your rationalization accepted is worth
more "points" in the "game" of social interaction.

You aren't?

That version of the naming policy was quietly retired some time ago.
And you did not attempt that point until just now.


> Why do you presume I care about justifying it to anyone?


Good point.  There I went making your mistake.  I definitely
should not have assumed that you cared about SOE's policy
regarding character names simply on the basis of what you
posted here.  It appears now that this entire argument has been
nothing more for you than a self-serving attempt at rationalizing
your dislike of "Poopooskidmarks Uranus".
