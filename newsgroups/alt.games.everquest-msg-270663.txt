Aw, come on. Everything we can do is guess. Sure you may be able to make
an educated guess - but it's a guess nonetheless. It could be the load
balancing that has gone haywire and after replacing it and tweaking the
new unit they did bring up the servers slowly. But as I said - even this
is a guess. ;)

I doubt SoE need to invent another reason for such a downtime if they
DID have a real one to cope with. So they oversimplify the matter but it
should be real though.
