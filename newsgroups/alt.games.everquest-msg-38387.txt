HELP I have been trying for hours to figure out how to program a
SOCIALS key so that If a char is targeted a social key could be used
to "tell" that char, so that the need to type the char name is
unnecessary i.e      /tell somebody {Ent}       If  this can be done
it would save a lot of time trying to capture the char name..As you
know some names do not
have a familiar ring to them like maybe    XxZooopanis  or what ever.

I have tried using the percent  key (%)  In various combinations with
/tell , /t, /tell%t, and so on. Actually it would seem that the
command /tell%t  which is intrpeted to mean: tell the target, ought to
work, but it doesn't . 

I am clueless

Can this be done?
