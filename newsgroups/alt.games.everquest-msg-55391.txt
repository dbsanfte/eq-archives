Agreed on the giving up AC for resists. You will have to that is for sure.
It will not be needed except for Dragon or Uber Mob raids or when you duel
and only against caster types where having high AC with no resistances is
just a waste of equipment. Best thing is to look for items that give the
resistances you want to replace to lower AC items you have. Like earrings,
rings and maybe mask. There are several jewelry crafted items that will work
to give the resistances you want. Next look for items that sacrifice a
little AC for resistances. Dreadscale armor is pretty good for this but
there are others. I really need to get to PoG for some Noctivagant armor. =)
