The much lower ac/hp of the Ranger vs. your Monk might be the key.  I
haven't heard much about it lately, but I can recall a lot of posts,
from back before they "fixed" Rangers for agro, where veteran players
talked about relative ac/hp being a significant agro modifier.  That
would fit what you describe, L65 tanks are gonna have ac/hp worlds
better than that L32 Ranger.

Oh, and a question:  why would your guildie Paladin stun on inc only?
(I infer the "only" from the way you described it).  The few occasions
where I've MT'd tough mobs with Kaev I never stopped stunning, doesn't
matter if it costs me a few DPS due to delayed swings when my job is
to hold agro.  I let the Monks, Rangers, Rogues, and casters worry
about killing the mob.
