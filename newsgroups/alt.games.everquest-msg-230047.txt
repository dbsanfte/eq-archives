I tried Rallos Zek once.  I didn't like PvP but a friend and I tried a
little test.  She was a wood elf warrior - level 20 + newbie armor - and
I was a level 20 wizard + newbie armor.

I drained my entire mana bar trying to burn her down.  She didn't resist
once.  She had over 1 bub of health left when I was done!  I needed a
deeper mana pool to beat her or she needed to already have some damage.
