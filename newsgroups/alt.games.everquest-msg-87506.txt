holy crap, i hate to say it but Monks are the best power
levelers...especially cabilis is central to perfect places.  FOB and Kurns
have skeletons up to 20, then just hit the giants, they follow a set pattern
in Warsliks Woods.  if anyone doesn't understand monk pl'ing then let me
explain.  If you are NOT grouped and beat the living snot out of a creature
and FD, the person that kills that creature gets ALL of the experience.  No
down time for mana, no chance of letting someone die for some fluky reason
(if FD works just stand back up and pull another thing)  Now i'll admit that
druid PL'ing is nice, but I prefer monk all the way.
