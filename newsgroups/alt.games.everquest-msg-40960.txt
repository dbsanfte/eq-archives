Except TCC does absolutely nothing to achieve this. It does not lure low level players
to use an under-utilized zone. It only prevents high level players from using that
under-utilized zone. That zone is not being used. The presence of 1 or 2 farmers
cannot and does not prevent 50+ other people from using other parts of the zone. Even
the small zone that is under-utilized can hold 40+ players. Yet by definition, those
40+ players are not there. TCC does not and will not change that fact. So what is it
worth?
