I was the same when I started playing (Dec 03). I did have the expertise and
brains of a friend who has played since the beginning but its just great to
get out there and learn it all first hand. Ive found now after playing for a
few months, that reading the manuals etc is more use to me as I'm not trying
to comprehend game play/strategy/finding my way around/ etc
