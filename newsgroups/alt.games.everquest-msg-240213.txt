Hi Dave, I just started playing 1 month ago and Im having a blast.
One thing I would recommend either if you join Eq or wait for EQ 2,
join a guild. Having a steady bunch of players to play with all the
time and answer your newbie questions makes a big difference.  Do some
research first though as a lot of people make guilds just cause they
want to be a leader.  The one I found has normally about 10 people
online at slow times and averages 25 people online at busy times.  Ive
had no problem getting help or finding people to group with.
