Concern grows on tainted wells
SOUTH COUNTY PROBLEM SPREADING
By Frank Sweeney
Mercury News

An underground plume of perchlorate, a chemical used in rocket fuel and =
highway flares that has contaminated some drinking-water wells in =
southern Santa Clara County, has spread farther than officials =
originally thought.

Results from new tests in the San Martin area show contamination in =
wells west and south of a four-mile-long target area where Santa Clara =
Valley Water District officials suspected that perchlorate tainted =
drinking-water supplies.

Initial results of the water district's large-scale tests of wells in =
the area won't be available until next week, but tests ordered by other =
government agencies showed the spread of the plume Thursday.

``We're starting to get indications that the plume may be larger than we =
anticipated,'' said water district spokesman Mike Di Marco. ``We're =
getting closer to finding how pervasive it is.''

The latest reports showed perchlorate in two of three wells of the West =
San Martin Water Works, which has about 100 customers in an area west of =
Highway 101.

``The scary part is that this well is so deep,'' said Sylvia Hamilton, =
president of the San Martin Neighborhood Alliance and a customer of the =
little water company. ``When it goes down to the lower strata, then =
you're really in trouble.''

Hamilton said the affected wells draw water from below 200 feet, while =
the well with no contamination is shallower.

Depending on how far the chemical has spread, it could take years to =
clean up once state officials decide how to do it.

Perchlorate is a salt used as an oxidizer in rocket fuel, highway safety =
flares and other products. When ingested, it disrupts iodine intake in =
the thyroid gland, which regulates hormone functions. That makes it =
especially harmful to pregnant women and infants. In fetuses, it can =
interfere with neurological development. Studies also suggest it can =
cause thyroid cancer.

The widespread contamination came to light two weeks ago when the water =
district got results of well water tests in the unincorporated San =
Martin area between Morgan Hill and Gilroy.

The plume of contamination originated at a 13-acre site at Tennant and =
Railroad avenues in southern Morgan Hill where the Olin Corp. operated a =
flare-manufacturing facility from 1955 to 1996, and has spread south in =
underground aquifers for years.

Olin cleaned up the site in 1997, when perchlorate was not yet =
identified by scientists as a health hazard. By the time the chemical =
was detected at the site in 2000 by a potential buyer, scientists had =
listed it as a groundwater environmental hazard. But officials then =
thought it was confined to the immediate area.

However, perchlorate was found in a nearby Morgan Hill municipal well in =
March, triggering the state's Central Coast Regional Water Quality =
Control Board to order Olin to conduct more tests. During the following =
10 months, the tests turned up contamination in 12 of 100 wells sampled.

In response to the test results in January, state and local health and =
water officials warned the more than 2,000 residents of the semirural =
area not to drink well water or use it for cooking until their wells =
could be cleared. The water district also launched an intensive free =
testing program.

By Thursday, the district had tested 398 wells, with more than 400 wells =
scheduled to be sampled. It takes three weeks to get the results from =
the laboratory, with reports on the first 140 due next week, Di Marco =
said.

The area of concern is bounded by Tennant Avenue on the north, Center =
Avenue on the east, Monterey Highway on the west and Masten Avenue on =
the south.

Olin, which was recently ordered by the state Central Coast Regional =
Water Quality Control Board to clean up the contamination and pay all =
costs, tested 32 more wells inside the original target area. Perchlorate =
was detected in 10 of these wells, with concentrations ranging from four =
parts per billion to 10 ppb. Earlier tests of wells near the source =
ranged as high as 98 ppb.

In addition, recent tests by the state Department of Public Health found =
perchlorate in the West San Martin Water Works wells -- outside the =
target area.

And a private well owner south of Masten Avenue had his two wells tested =
and found perchlorate in one of them.

There are no federal or state drinking-water standards or maximum =
allowable contaminant levels for perchlorate. However, the state =
Department of Health Services has set four ppb as the level at which =
action must be taken. State Sen. Byron Sher, D-San Jose, has written a =
law requiring the state to adopt a standard by Jan. 1. The state Office =
of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has proposed a public health =
goal of six ppb.

On Thursday, Olin said it would ``take the lead in testing wells outside =
the box that the water district has drawn,'' said the company's project =
manager, Rick McClure. ``We've got to do the right thing here.''

McClure said the company will continue to provide bottled water to =
everyone whose wells show perchlorate concentrations of four ppb or =
more, as well as to all customers of the West San Martin Water Works.
