Thanks for the examples.  So far I'm not sure they apply for me,
or for pure melees in general.

#1 doesn't apply because I shouldn't ever be targeting a mezzed
or similarly CC'ed mob, via /assist or anything else, since I
have nothing I can do to it.

#3 again applies to casters; as a melee, I want to be swinging,
and to be told if I'm out of range.

#2 could apply, except it's just a matter of training.  I've
grown accustomed to just hitting my /assist hotkey and knowing
it'll turn on autoattack.  In some sense, I'm used to using
a two-key sequence to start attacking: either select a mob and
turn on autoattack, or select a PC and assist.  That's why I
talked about needing to retrain myself if I decide it's bad.

Actually, I can see where #1 could be a problem even for melee.
E.g., the current mob dies, and the MA is choosing the next
target from among the mezzed adds.  He might well want to make
sure he's the one who breaks mez, so he can generate a lot of
agro as he does it.  If I /assist him too soon, I'll break mez.
But even then, it's more an error of me acting too soon; if I
waited for him to say Go, it doesn't really matter if I hit
/assist at that point, or if I've already assisted (without
autoattacking) and just turn on attack when he's ready.

Again, for a caster it's more important, because I might be
planning to cast a spell on the mob as my first action, so I
want to have it pre-targetted without breaking mez.
