At least on Saryrn server, Rathe Mountains has become largely a 40s/50s
soloers zone. This is different from a year or so ago when I was a low 30s
cleric and often saw groups around that level in there. I spent quite a bit
of time there in recent weeks as a 40s beastlord, and almost never saw a
group. It was all people like me soloing the giants for plat+exp or, in the
case of 50s people, just for plat. Now and then I'd see someone in their 30s
shouting out LFG, and they always ended up leaving for lack of response.
(And it only takes one 50s druid triple-kiting in there to reduce the
availability of giants for everyone else down to a trickle).
