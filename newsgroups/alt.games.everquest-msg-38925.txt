It's also a matter of technical ability... For example, dubbing in Spain
is down to a fine art, with carefully chosen voice actors who always dub
the same screen actors movie after movie, and a painstaking attention to
lip-synch. On the other hand, dubbing in Germany is pretty lousy, with
voices seemingly picked at random and only the most cursory regard for
lip-synch. In the US, it's mostly reasonably good, with a few
outstanding examples, like the Disney dub of Princess Mononoke.

Of course, it's not like subtitling is an exact science... I've seen
some examples of hilariously mistranslated dialogue in subtitles, but
there are fewer things that can go wrong.
