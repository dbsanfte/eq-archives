   If we remember this, we should also remember that EQ was a ground
breaking game.  There may have been other MMORPG before, but none that
exerted the mass appeal to the genre that EQ did.  The success of EQ paved
the way for all the other MMORPGs that we now or soon will have to choose
from.  As a result, there is alot more competition for players now than
there was five years ago.  True, there are also more players who are
interested in this sort of game, but I think that players who are willing
to pay a month fee to play any game are always going to be a fairly shall
subset of all gamers in general.

   That said, can _any_ MMORPG released these day get the numbers that EQ
did?  I don't think so.

   You and I clearly have a different idea of what a good reason to play
for is.  For you, it seems that you want some sort of tangible reward that
your character will earn to have and keep after you are done with whatever
task it was that you are doing.  For me, I'm more interested in having fun
with the task at hand, than having some sort of upgrade to my character
because of doing the work and reaping the reward.

   Don't get me wrong.  I played EQ for almost 4 years.  I was totally
interested in getting loot for all that time.  I just got bored with it,
eventually.  You may or may not.  

   Either way, I don't think that either of us are wrong, exactly. 
Clearly, I have a more pro-CoH bias than you do.  Since I enjoy it more
than you did, I'm more optimistic than you about it's future.  But this is
all clearly conjecture at this point.  CoH will have to face the twin
threats of EQII and WoW in the not too distant future, and it will be
interesting to see how it holds up to these challenges.

    No arguments here, though I've never played AC and know nothing of the
loot system.  But I'll take your word on that.
