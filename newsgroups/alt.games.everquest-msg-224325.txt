Since an old version (with who knows how much missing data) is up and
running on EQTraders currently, go to their website and put the item
name in the search field under the navigation menu.  If the item is
found, click on the name, then click on the "Find recipes that use this
item" link.

Just note that there's some stuff out there that's got a tradeskill tag
that's still NKU (No Known Use).
