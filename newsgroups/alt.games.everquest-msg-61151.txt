I'm not talking so much in zoning, but in the game play itself.  Your
connection will affect whether the cleric you're playing sees that the
chanter is down to one red, when he really died five seconds ago (ok,
extreme, but you get the point).  Also causes the lag MOBs.

Not noticably.  Most important thing, I think is a good video card, so you
can keep the clip plane all the way out.  Important for unfamiliar zones,
and zones with half-the-friggen-zone-aggro-radius mobs.
