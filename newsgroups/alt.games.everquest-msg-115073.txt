Actually yes you can.  One of the options on Display is "Screen Same Size as
Resolution" or some such thing.  If you click this to off, whatever
resolution you set the screen to it will fill your monitor regardless of
what F10 view you go with.  Not that you'd want to.  The full screen view
with the transparent windows is much better.
