It's a lot of fun, but, I don't think I'd try soloing it much at 51.  There
are lots of wandering mobs that could easily add while kiting.  What The
Grey was known for was being an awesome place for AoE grouping.  Then they
changed things, and made it much more difficult for that.  I suspect the
change also would make it more difficult on a soloing druid.  At 51, my
first visit there, I found it almost impossible to stick spells on the mobs.
At 54, I find that I don't have too much trouble sticking spells.  At 54, I
have only been there with groups, and it has been loads of fun, I got my EB
amulet by turning in the Shissar Organs in Katta.
