My wood elves leave Kelethin at level one (usually by leaping off the edge to
their death) and hope to never go back.  I always end up back there every few
months (today, for instance, to get Ring of Combines) and I always blunder
around trying to find my guild or the bank.

I was asked if I had bought the character on ebay last time, that was
embarrassing.

Him.
