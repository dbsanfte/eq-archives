I saw it happen in High Pass fighting gnolls the other day.  Our tank went
LD just as he was fighting a Gnoll Shaman and a Gnoll Flamepaw.  Both were
aggroed in the tank.  We were happily beating on the Paw when the tank got
in the last blow and "poof", no corpse.  The tank turns his attentions to
the shaman and we smack it around some.  Who gets the kill?  The tank.  The
corpse dissapears again.  I thought that the corpses would stay as it was
"technically" a PC that got the kill.  I'm wondering if they would have
stayed if the rest of the group had not been there.
