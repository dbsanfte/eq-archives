No, no, no. I'm not talking about technical issues, or bashing Verant for
their coding, etc. I mean (at least in terms of the quests) the ones that
work, but have something really frustrating and non-intuitive that made them
exasperating for the first players to figure out without a walkthrough of
spoilers from some web site. I just thought the werewolf talon one was a good
possible example, because if some quest NPC told me I had to bring him a
werewolf talon, and I had no clue about it, I would think I would start out
by checking with the local werewolves, no? Why would you possible guess that
a gypsy in some far off zone would drop it?

As to mobs and zones, I'm guessing the first person that fell down into The
Hole from a relatively worry free lowbie area had an unpleasant surprise. And
how about the dragons? What a thrill it must have been for that first group
of higher level players to stumble on Vox. And what a shocking surprise to
find that she could summon you at will and completely heal herself! (Ok..
that one was probably a very short lived thrill for them.)
