yes, but you would still have people who wanted to exploit that monsters
can't hit you from buildings then.  and cast on the mob from inside the
building while the mob is trapped outside.  Granted it would be quite
nice if the mobs didn't path through the buildings, I mean if i were a
gypsy in oasis, the number of times all of my goods would be smashed by
some rampaging sand giant, I would have long since left for a giant free
area, not to mention the wandering undead that slaughter my customers. 
Plain and simple its done to avoid exploits.
