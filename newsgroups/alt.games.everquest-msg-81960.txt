I know a cleric who thinks I am a dr00d because I'd do that whilst
grouped with her, a warrior, and another druid in my low 40s.

I avoid spending time around that cleric.

And speaking of heal messages, I saved our raid enchanter last night
with a chloroblast when the cleric in his group was busy *flexes*.
He would have died if my 'Chloroblast on xxxx' hotkey had the text
message before the spellcasting instead of the other way around.
