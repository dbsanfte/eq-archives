I got ES vambraces for my druid for only 1k.
I got Loam Encrusted boots for my mage for only 200.
I got Amulet of Insight which has Extended Enhancement 3! on it for only 2.5k

What kills me is the people that are trying to sell stupidly common items
for outrageous prices. Like:

Cougar Claw earrings for 500pp ?!?!
Orc fang earrings for 200pp ?!?!
Savants cap for 400pp ?

If they tried this in EC or the Auction channel they'd be crucified.
I am all for people charging what they want for their stuff but Jeeeez.
This is especially stupid since those items are also being sold
by other people for reasonable and even discount prices in the
Bazaar.

What are they thinking? Why are they wasting Bazaar space
with this shit?
