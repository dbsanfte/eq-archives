Well, bloated and halfassed or not, we now have folks in our guild on
Xev getting up to the ranges of going on Vox and Naggy raids, etc. and
others getting close.  If there are such server boards where such
information might be posted, and any of you know about them, I'd still
like to give them a look.
   But yes, I think that VI really dropped the ball on that one.
Removing the server boards (which were also often used for guild
information by some guilds) should have been followed *at least* by
reinstating them as moderated boards where flames, etc. could be
censored if they must, but legit information could be passed along with
contact information for the pertinent people/guilds.  For a game that is
*so* structured around grouping and guilds, it seems we are left with
little or no server wide, company organized method of distributing this
critical info.
