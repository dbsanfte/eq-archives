Didn't see it posted, so here's a cut n paste from the site:

--------------
To help clarify the new system, I went to the message boards and
looked for questions that people still had and posed them to the
EQLive team. If you have any other questions about the system, please
send them to the Developer's Corner and I'll try to provide answers. 

Q: I'm still confused about Endurance. Will it completely replace
Stamina? How will that affect swimming? 

A: Yes, Endurance will completely replace Stamina. Some of the
occasions that used Stamina in the old system will no longer require
the expenditure of a resource. For example, swimming will no longer
use a resource. 

Q: If jumping costs Endurance, and only melee classes and hybrids have
Endurance... won't that be a problem for casters when they want to
jump? 

A: All classes get an Endurance bar and an Endurance pool. So everyone
can still jump. 

Q: I understand that the new combat skills and all disciplines will
use Endurance, and that's why Endurance won't be affected by any
spells that currently affect Stamina. But why remove the Stamina
effects from those spells? Some classes gain some value to their group
through the use of those spells. 

A: Since we are removing Stamina, there won't be any value to spells
that affect Stamina. 

There will be additional spells added that modify Endurance. Right now
these will be buffs that increase your total pool. We are not planning
on adding any that would regenerate the pool. These spells will be
tuned to balance the ability to aid in the return of Endurance. Just
exchanging the Stamina effects with Endurance effects wouldn't allow
us any control over the balance of the new system and its interaction
with spells. It hasn't been decided which classes will get those
spells yet, but obviously we'll be taking into consideration the
effects of the changes to the existing spells might have on caster
desirability. 

Q: Will NPCs be using these new abilities? 

A: Not at this time. Frankly, there's a lot of work involved in
allowing NPCs to use these abilities, and it would have a rather
wide-spread effect on the challenge of those NPCs that would be
complicated to evaluate. So we're only giving this to PCs. 

Q: There seems to be some confusion about how these new skills will be
used. Will we be clicking a button on the screen with our mouse, or
can we make hotbuttons with the new skills and just press a key to
activate them? 

A: You will be able to click on the icons, use hotbuttons in your
hotbutton box or access a melee skills box only for these abilities
through CTRL+ #. 

Q: You mentioned that you are making some other changes to melee,
including giving warriors an automatic mitigation percentage. Will PC
warriors of all levels get this ability? 

A: PC warriors of all levels will gain the mitigation boost. 

Q: These changes look very interesting. But some of us are concerned
that these changes might overbalance things. What steps are you taking
to keep the balance pendulum from swinging too far toward the pure
melee classes? 

A: We'll be testing this system on the Test server until it goes Live.
The big advantage of the system is the flexibility. Adjusting it won't
require days of programmer time. If we discover that a facet of the
new skills is over or under powered, we can adjust it.

Q: Regarding the new discipline system using Endurance: will it be
possible to stop a disc midway through its use when it doesn't make
sense to keep it up, in order to save some Endurance? 

A: Yes, you will be able to stop a discipline while it is active. If
you cancel a discipline, however, you must still wait the normal
recharge time before using it again. 

Q: You mentioned that these new skills will be learned by finding
ancient tomes. Will these tomes be No Drop? 

A: Right now the plan is to introduce them as droppable. There may be
some tomes that result from special quests that are no-drop in the
future.
