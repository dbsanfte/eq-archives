Argh, I keep forgetting to include things.  I wanted to also say that
Evan's work is best when you *do* give him extra details.  If you just
send him one screenshot of your character, the final product won't look as
good as if you say "I want my hair this style, and I want this kind of
pose", etc etc. I think he gets a little tired of same-old, same-old, so
when he gets something new and different to try, he really goes wild.  The
best pictures I've ever seen him do are, oddly enough, mine, Rakyn's, and
Crydee Ossirand's.  And I know Crydee also put in a helluva lot of request
for detail.
