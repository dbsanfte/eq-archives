It's me, your friendly Iksar pain in the butt again ......

I think I'm about ready to give tailoring cured silk a try, but I can't seem
to get the heavy kiola brewed.  I'm combining  two kiola saps, one bottle,
and one flask of water in the brewer's barrel outside the bank in East Cab,
but when I try the combine I get the "You can't combine these items in this
container type" message (frustrating, but *much* better than losing the
items altogether).

The kicker may be the water ... all I can find in Cabilis (East or West) are
flasks of "Bloodwater".  Will this do for brewing the heavy kiola, or do I
need to find plain old water somewhere?

Thanks in advance for any help ... it's much appreciated. :-)
