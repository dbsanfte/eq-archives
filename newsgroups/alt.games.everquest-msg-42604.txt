I am a lvl 18 enchanter and I had the best time of my EQ life last night in
Permafrost.  At one point someone over pulled and I had 5 of 6 mobs mezzed
and completely under control for the duration of about 10 min as they were
systematically slaughtered.  Had I not been able to do that, we would have
been absolutely crushed, so I was feeling pretty good, however, I did it
without any targeting macros, it was really just dumb newbie luck.

I basically want to know what macros all you more experienced enchanters use
to systematically target mobs, I have a /g mezzing %t macro set up and a
/assist macro set up, but thats about it....what else do you use to keep the
group well informed and be able to target specific mobs when there are 5 on
top of each other...

TIA!
