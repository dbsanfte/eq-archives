The character flags are for the new planes added in Planes of Power, not 
for the old Planes (Fear, Hate, Growth, Mischief, Air).  Did I miss any?

Of the new planes, originally, Plane of Nightmare, Disease, Innovation, 
and Justice were open to all players level 46+, and to get access to any 
of the other planes, you needed to go through a trial, or perform a 
quest.  Since then, Valor, Storm, Halls of Honor, Crypt of Decay, and 
Bastion of Thunder have been opened up to all players of the appropriate 
level, the level restriction is different depending on the plane.  The 
planes beyond those still require flagging.
