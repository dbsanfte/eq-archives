Yet, on the other side of that coin, if they made the expansions "tier"
correctly, that loot will actually not be very enticing at all.  In fact, I
think they do this.  People just don't realize it's on a 2nd-expansion
delay.  :)  I have little reason to go to Velious or earlier.  People in
elementals should have little reason to go to Luclin or earlier (though I
think the loot gap isn't quite big enough to get the proper separation, I see
that as a result of the mob-power gap not being quite big enough due to some
balance changes they made around that time).
