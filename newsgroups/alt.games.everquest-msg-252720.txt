	My level 30 chanter in Echo Caverns high side.  He pulls
mobs to the guard, lets the guard kill it until it turns to run then
charms it. He makes it follow him back a bit then inviss's to break
charm and kills former pet.  I die plenty of times doing this do
to resists, adds, and the pet recovering enough to stop running and 
attacking me so its' not a foolproof system but it's still an easy way
to solo reds.

	Think it's illegal though?
