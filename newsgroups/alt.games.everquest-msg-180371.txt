There is just as many greedy ass clerics that whore every damn gem, ppitem

There is nothing worse than somebody telling you how to play YOUR game.
You weren't a chanter, stop trying them how to play their character. You
weren't a bard, stop acting like you were the bard expert, and so on...

Bull.  R/l friend solod his cleric from 1-57 before Kei (or luclin) even
existed.  NO undead dots, half the nukes they have now, absolutele trash
gear (blood something tunic....)

You can make the cost of KEI from as little as 4 mobs, yeah, that really
