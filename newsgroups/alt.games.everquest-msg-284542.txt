True.  And I'm thinking of the 'normal' rounded group.  Tank, healer,
slower, DPS.  Wizard falls under DPS.

The slower can almost always debuff.  Some DPS classes have some form
of snare (berserker, necro, ranger).  Wizard does indeed stun the snot
out of CH or gate mobs, so that adds one or two additional  casts at
the end.  Still an easy going class all in all.
