Ok, there are alot of details we don't know.  But two guys could only come up
with 9 plat between them?  How often do you carry only 9 plat on ya?  Now I'm
not saying it's not possible.  My Baby characters usually don't have more than
a few, but my Baby characters aren't going to be asking for a rez.... they'd be
too embarassed!
My first (untwinked) character, my ranger, always carried around 20 PP from the
time she was 25 on.  
*If* I was broke I would sure be explaining that to the rezzer and begging
forgiveness.... 
(NOWadays I always carry 50 plat or more just in CASE of emergencies).
