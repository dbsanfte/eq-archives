My government doesn't do what I want? They run the country, help the
needy, provide healthcare to *all*, help persecuted refugees and reduced
the classification level of grass - that *is* what I want. So dontcha
tell me what I want.

And anyway, what makes you think I can do nothing about a bad
government? I can use my vote. Remember: you can't buy your way into
power here... :P
