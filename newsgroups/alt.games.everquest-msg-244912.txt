Not quite sure I agree with that assessment, but close enough for government

Does the new endurance system really regenerate that fast?   It doesn't seem
that defensive would be available for every fight?   I also thought they

20 seconds, actually.   With a one hour timer, unless they got rid of that?

The hate capabilities also cost endurance, right?    So they have enough
endurance regeneration to be constantly defensive, using hate abilities, and
enough left over to go furious whenever they need it?
