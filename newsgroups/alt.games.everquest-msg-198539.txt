So you choose which is the most important. If the 60s have higher levels 
available to them now, then it just stands to reason that they may wind 
up in a situation where they will reap better xp in some zones where 52's 
should fear to tread. 

For crying out loud. This is beginning to sound like it's all about 
people whining about content that is out of their reach unless they turn 
down the AA and work on levelling a bit.

Does that 58 not have the same zones available to them that those 60's 
made it to 60 in? They might think about starting there, as the others 
did.

Nope. I see zones too dangerous for 50's players, yet the 50's players 
complaining that they can't go there.

So now content has been added that is geared to be challenging to people 
*13* levels higher than you (at 52), yet you don't understand why it is 
not designed for you to get there easily? If that's clueless, then sure, 
I'm that.

See my above statement. You're 13 levels below the uberest now. It's not 
like you can't get to anything you were strong enough to handle before. 
You just can't (yet) get to the content that was designed with those *13* 
levels higher than you in mind.

It doesn't matter though. All the whining has had the desired effect. 
Getting into these zones will soon just require, um, nothing? Any goober 
will be able to get there and make your game such a more *rich* 
experience. Enjoy.

Kind of reminds me of the tendency nowadays in little league athletics to 
give everyone in the league the same trophy regardless of record so that 
no one gets discouraged.
