Its just mana... put him in a raid with kei and a bard singing chorus
nearby, and they pull their weight for sure. In a xp grind group without
mana song, probably a melee or pet class would be better, but bear in mind
that a wizard is probably the best solo class after 50, and doesnt need a
group at all. Until you get to the planes, quadding is probably faster xp
than you will get in most groups, and theres no sitting around LFG.
