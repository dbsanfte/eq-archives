Those mobs do sound underpowered for their level. L38 mobs taking 5% off
a L40 monk? I'm sure there's an awful lot of monks would like to find them. So
the obvious answer is to upgrade those mobs. SoE has done this, there used
to be a "secret" xp camp in nurga that monks could solo since the mobs
were dramatic undercon's. It showed up on the monk class website and a
couple of weeks later it vanished. Though there's a couple more that they
don't seem interested in fixing *cough* HH nobles *cough*. The did fix
shrooms though.

But in short, yes. Although I believe this is more about errors of mob
progression rather than endemic. There are still lots of blue to 40 mobs that
will put the hurting on you. I'd like to see mob drops and
difficulty of old world locations matched to the current game environment
rather than left static. And while they're doing that perhaps they could
fix the insane boost they gave to caster mobs at this level.

I guess there's a fundamental choice here. Strictly control power
inflation, which Sony can't do because they want to offer "progression"
to encourage the purchase of expansions. Or if not then make sure the
"old" content is kept balanced against the new reality. Although the
expansions make money and the re-balancing doesn't.

Creating a game where the character can "progress", especially through
game expansions, without becoming imbalancing is a fundamental challenge.
AD&D didn't manage it, the game became more and more unstable as the
higher levels were reached. EQ is fundamentally flawed because they
didn't solve this problem. Then again none of the recent MMOPRG's
have proven they have an answer that will survive the test of time.
