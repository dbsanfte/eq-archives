You're lucky then. Only seen 1 Earring on a lvl 60 warrior once and had
about 6 SBSes drop on MY GROUP alone. I know of at least 10 other mobs who
wielded the shields but were in a train so I couldn't get to them. SBS is
uncommon to rare, Earring is Ultra Ultra Rare.
Heck I even have 2 SBS rot in the guildbank at the moment and we're a guild
just doing it's first planar raids.
