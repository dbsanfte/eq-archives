I have only been in on one of these massive hunts, and that was for an epic
weapon that my guild had going to kill Capt. Rottgrime in the Overthere
zone.  We had 3 teams of 6 each with it's own leader and each team was as
balanced as it could get.  I was the youngest, and it so happened that my
team didn't do the most damage so no exp.  Since we're all in the guild we
used guild chat to talk to everyone, but group chat to talk to eachother.
I'm assuming that if its not a complete guild raid then you could use /ooc
or /shout to accomplish the same thing, but I am not yet old enough to do
the plains raids yet, so I can't tell you how that is done.
