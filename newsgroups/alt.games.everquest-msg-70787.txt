    People who play little characters for fun don't want to deal with the
downtime of LFG/LFP. Log on, run to where mobs are and GO. By and large,
that isn't available in EQ - too much base downtime, too much group
emphasis. Give someone a Fungi, though, and they're like DAoC characters.

    You don't want to make that wager. Fungi will get you over one Inner
Fire's worth of HPs in two ticks, and recovers HPs during combat. How fast
do you med at level 9, again?
