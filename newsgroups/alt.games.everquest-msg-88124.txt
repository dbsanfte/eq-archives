You'd be amazed. Six necros can be a devastating group, all the way up
to 60 in outdoor zones with room to kite. You get:

1 Puller / snarer
1 Healer / Drain DoT
1 Fear / Disease DoT
1 Ignite Bones /  Fire DoT (or snare-nuke in Skyfire.)
1 Chill Bones / Poison DoT
1 Debuff / CC

And everybody but the CC caster has a pet up. 

I've never gotten to 6, but 4 necros tore a wide swath through Skyfire
and, with the addition of a mage and rogue, had trouble finding pulls,
even though there was no one else in the zone.
