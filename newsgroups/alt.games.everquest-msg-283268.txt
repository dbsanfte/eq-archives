hey,

tried logging in on the beta server (ran the other patcher to connect, not 
using any other software like winEQ ... patched, complete file checked ...)

and when i'm in, all animations are buggered...either not there or too fast 
...pressing left or right spins me around (not smoothly either) ... it's 
very uncool


is this a graphics issue? is it something somewhere on my comp? (2.4g amd 
d/c, 3gb ram, ati x1800xt, windows xp pro, lots of free hdd space)


is it the server? did they not set up the graphics changes (all old models = 
cool .. .but maybe they messed up driver reversals?)

other people i've met in game (for the 5 minutes i could stand to be logged 
in) did not report similiar issues






thanks for any insights
