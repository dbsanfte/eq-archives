No, I'm sorry, it's not true.  Jeremiah is around level 60.  My enchanter is
55.

There are SO many 50+ people who don't know how to get to Everfrost,
Nagafen's Lair, Guk...you name it.  They don't know how to get to NK from WC
without a port.  They don't know how to get through Rathe Mountains (errr
wait, disregard that one, I always get lost <g> ).

"Uh, Sense Heading?  I don't need no steenkin Sense Heading."

Why doesn't anyone round locs off to the nearest 100?   Loc 4234, 5134 can
easily be made MUCH more easily remembered by simply saying p4200,
p5100...and it won't make any difference...if you get to near that loc
you're going to see your destination unless you're under water or swimming
in lava.
