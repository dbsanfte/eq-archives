We just went through this discussion in my guild and I
don't remember exactly, but, up to a certain level, from
51 up to a certain level (62? That number sticks in my
head), it takes as much XP to get an AA point as it took
to reach the next level when you were 51. For example,
if it took 1500 XP to go from level 51 to 52, then when
you're level 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, etc., it's going to take
1500XP to get an AA point. There was some mention of that
changing at a certain level (in the 60's, I think) but I
don't remember what exactly was said about that.
