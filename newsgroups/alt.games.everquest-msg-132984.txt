  There's a "Whoyourdaddy" on FV, of all places.  I've petitioned him, and I know
that others have as well.  Yet he seems to be doing fine.  I remember when the MotD
on FV invited people to report bad names, so that the offenders could be quickly
dealt with.  Those days are clearly gone.  Just don't use the words "Nigger", "Cunt",
or "Binladin" and your goofy ass name is a-okay!

Annie <--- Not the least bit bitter about it, either.
