There's a current thread on this on the cleric forums, although many of
the replies seem to be ignoring the level of the person originally asking.

Be careful with CH for now. Complete Heal is not always the right tool
for the job; if your tank has under 2K HP or so I would stick with
Superior for now. For high-HP tanks it will be your staple heal however.

Most clerics seem to use three basic heals:
(1) "Heal the Tank" - Superior Heal or Complete Heal
(2) "Keep the chanter alive" - quick-casting heal to top up casters,
    particularly when they are being attacked, for whom your "tank"
    heal is overkill. At level 39 this is probably GHeal, but Valor
    can also work here.
(3) "Topup" - efficient heal to top up HP when time is not an issue.
    This may be the same as your caster heal, or it may be one of the
    Celestial heals (in your case, Celestial Healing). The cleric
    Heal-over-Time line is often more efficient than the "instant" heal
    line and often fills this slot.

Other common spells memmed:
- Divine Aura
- Divine Barrier
- Root (many clerics use the *first* root even into their 50s).
- Pacify (lull line)
- Valor/Resolution/Heroism line (for buffing and sometimes for healing).
- Atone (root & atone is a common crowd control combo - works even
  better with Pacify thrown in).
- Nuke (Wrath at your level, I believe) - for when you have excess mana.

Hope that's some help.
