In an outdoor area with plenty of low-mid dark blues I can solo
non-stop with a pet. It's almost too easy with a BL (up to level 18 so
far). Almost all of the damage produced is Melee (Pet + BL). I can
regen mana (slowly obviously) while fighting alongside my pet. Even
when I do get low on mana I can send the pet in and med while he
fights. The level 15 pet (buffed to level 16 with spell) has a 30 DD
magic based process that fires off like crazy. He can take on 2-3
high-blue con creatures at once while I sit back and toss in pet-heals
over the course of the fight. I cannot think of any other class that
can take (melee/tank) on 3 high blues at level 16 at the same time.

This won't last forever though. As a BL levels up the pet gets lower
in level and less effective. BL go 7-9 levels between pets, unlike the
other pet classes that get upgrades every 4 levels. At level 18 I am
already out-damaging my pet despite his DD process.
