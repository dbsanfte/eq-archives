Summoned monsters used to have a special proc from time to time.

Since a few patches ago (like 4-5 months) they only cast damageshields on
themselves, and only the highest versions of the spell cast.

The pro of summoned monsters is just that: they don't cast so have a round
of combat extra every tick or so.
This might seem bad, but against the high res monsters in for example
Velious your water pet's cold nuke is worth crap.

I myself am only lvl 55, but from what I've read about the lvl 60's on
messageboards and such, MS3 is actually a pretty decent pet. In some cases
it's even preferred over the Epic or the 60 Water because of the fact that
it doesn't cast.

Try scourging the web for mage messageboards and you might get to know the
ins and outs of the MS spells.
www.magecompendium has a nice board discussing pets and I advice you check
there first.
