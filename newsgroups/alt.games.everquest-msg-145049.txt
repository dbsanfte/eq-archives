To anyone out there that uses WinAmp to listen to music while playing EQ I
found a wonderful little plugin on the WinAmp site.  I normally have music
of a specific genre playing on shuffle and every now and then I'll hit a
song that is either a large amount of blank space (hidden tracks at the end
of a CD) or one that I just plain don't want to listen to.  So I'd be stuck
till the song would end, till I ran across this plugin.  It's called EverAmp
and basically once you install it, you make a text file called notes.txt in
your EQ directory and then make a hotkey that says /note winamp next or some
other such command.  Works really well.  And no, I'm not a part of the team
that made this, blah blah blah, not a scam or some stupid thing.  Just
thought I'd share something I found with everyone here.

Link for it is: (and I'm sure it will wrap)

Or just go to www.classic.winamp.com and do a search under plugins for
EverAmp, will bring you right to it.  Only works with Winamp 2, but 3 sucks
anyway, so it doesn't matter.
