Well our paladin wasn't 10k+ unbuffed.  This was very early GoD, and despite
being in full time armour (he was the most active pali on the server) he was
still "only" 9k unbuffed (11 buffed).  There was very limited shielding
available in time too, maybe 4% or so on typical gear choices

Of course this was in the days of /disc defensive.. which meant he mitigated
damage I guess on a par with a 9k buffed warrior with no shielding..

Thats sad.  I mean more fool Sony if thats the ONLY way to beat it.. but I
don't think it is, and it really is gimping the encounter (as charm does
everywhere /sigh).  I know my perspective of the trials isnt the same as how
many face them (11khp monk =p) but as an example, a (now) guildie of mine
finished his tipt trial on our last server (we both came from Prexus) as a
guild group of elemental flagged/zero EP armour people.  They hadn't done
the Luclin thing, so there was no vexthal armour, just what had been gained
in PoP flaggings and their 1 or 2 earth ring runs (the SK was 8.x bufffed,
warrior about 9k).  The monk used his riposte disc for some early damage,
then the warrior did the same, and then finally /defensive.  Thats where you
are coming from it sounds, and whilst some aspects of that strat wouldn't
work now (namely the disc shit they implemented), this was also pre-revamp,
when his dps was NOTICABLY higher.  Yes they used 2 clerics, yes they had 8k
harmtouch or whatever, but they still tanked it and won with some "merit"

Well 2 healers is necessary, its easy to understand adding a second healer
made all the difference if you are aware of what rampage is.
I did tipt a few weeks ago (after a break of a few months), and noticed the
first named didn't even rampage anymore though -- wtf?

First time we passed it, we had a shaman as secondary healer/slower, and he
healed me for rampage on both mobs.  We also did it with 2 clerics (main and
twink) and beast slower (well he didnt slow the final named, but thats what
he was there for..) and once with a druid.  Each has its merits, but any of
them works fine really.  I found monk as rampage tank worked better than a
knight too, especially when the only other healer was a shaman, for 2 simple
reasons: /disc stonestance (12 seconds of massively reduced incoming damage)
allowing the shaman to get it slowed before needing to heal.. and of course
mend, for the same reasons.  A warrior could do the mob better, but knights
are kindof lacking in the damage reducing disc department.  Did it once, the
SK ramp tank got 1 rounded at 100% heh.. that was fun.

Man the shitness that is GoD doesn't truly begin to show itself until AFTER
tipt/ved!
