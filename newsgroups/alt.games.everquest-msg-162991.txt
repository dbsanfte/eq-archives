Ok Dennis, you're right, it is very very faintly possible that
what happens there is that food is consumed more slowly.  But
what is certain beyond any doubt is that if you hang out in
Freeport and Commons using Rations and Water they will go down
at the same rate.  If you then go into NRo or Oasis you will
run out of Water LONG before you run out of food.  Since I
didn't notice a need to buy food less often, but rather that I
was hitting a vendor more often for Water, I'll go with the
belief that Water is consumed faster.  The same goes for my
other observations.
