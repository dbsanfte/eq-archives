Actually me and a few in my guild often camp this spot. It can be easily
done with 3 druids.
Just will be a long battle. Only dot nd use any right click items you have.
The fight s can last up to 20 minutes.
Then agian the absolue best way to kill these is with a group of druids and
1 warriror or sk.
Have one of the druids breath of ro the elysian exaqctly 4 times back to
back. Not once and wait for it to wear off, i mean 4 times in quick
succession. That will get you all the aggro.
Then simply run it back and forth along the wall while the warrior/tank
attacks from behind. A rogue works really well here.

Half the druids in my guild are already fully equiped. The gear is very
nice.
