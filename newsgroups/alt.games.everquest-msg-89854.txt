Well, if you're not yet KOS to the good guys in Qeynos, go to North Karana.
By the river dividing North Karana from South Karana is a camp of bandits.
Start killing them. Not only do they drop the occasional bronze weapon, but
they should also drop Bandit Sashes every now and then. Collect as many of
these as you possibly can carry, and go to Qeynos, and deliver them to
Chesgard Sydwen in the Temple of Life in South Qeynos. That will give you
good faction with the Qeynos Guards. However, the damn merchants are still
apprehensive to me... bastards.
For a REAL nice challenge, look into the Qeynos Badge quests. They're great
fun, and the final reward is very much worth it!
