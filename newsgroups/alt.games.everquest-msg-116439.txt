1) I think it is, if it's like the other kunark quest spells (druid Beguile
Plants; enchanter Illusion Iksar, etc)
2) I'm fairly sure there's 3 separate people who give out the quest (they
all want the same items though), one for evil shaman (troll/ogre) in the
Overthere, one for good shaman (Barbarian/Vah Shir) in Firiona Vie, and one
for iksar shaman in Cabilis, I believe it starts with one of the guys in the
basement area of the shaman/SK guild area, it's been a few months since I
played my ikky shaman, so I'm not as clear with that area as I once was.  I
know there's separate ones in the OT and FV outposts, and I remember a guy
in Cabilis that asks for the exact same items, either that or I'm thinking
of the spell lottery quest where they ask for a copy of 1 of 4 spells and
there's 4 possible spells that you can get as a reward.

Also, merchants won't agro you even if they're on a faction that you're max
kos to, the minimum that they will con on you is dubious, you can't use
vendors at dubious (takes apprehensive or higher), but they won't attack
you.  I don't think vendors are social, but I haven't exactly spent time
killing stuff next to their merchant friends, though I did manage to make
the newspaper vendor (and most of the guards in the area) attack me in
Rivervale by /dueling a newbie beggar and letting him hit me (all of the
sudden the vendor starts hitting me, so I ran away fast)
