Definitely.
Spent last night exping and listening to others on the tradeskill
channel who were experimenting. Celestial temper is sheer evil, even
compared with the 8th shawl (and here we'd thought they'd learned when
they removed gem requirements from the cultural smithing armors).
I am really going to look into the stuff in the Liber Brassica books,
it looks like a potential fun quest - and it has a recipe for Lucky
Cabbage! (Those books were definitely written by someone who reads the
Druid's Grove, and not just because of the cabbage)
Also planning on cooking up a real feast one day :)
