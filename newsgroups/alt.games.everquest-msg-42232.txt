You mean you'll have to pay for use of the non updated servers, like FPS
ones (Quake, Unreal, HL etc) Well guess what, that isn't far away. The
companies that ran these servers for free have found that it is difficult to
make a profit (that's right they're not doing it because they love you) and
many have already gone under.
It won't be long before the you are paying play all games online, seems kind
of harsh compared to how it used to be but if the quality of the server is
high enough I don't mind paying.

The likes of EQ, AC, UO, AO and soon, DAoC have servers that are constantly
updated and constantly supervised, they have to pay staff to do that, let
alone the sort of bandwidth the need for that amount of servers.

If you don't want to pay anymore money after buying a game, stick to single
player ones. Personally I cannot be bothered with single player games and
don't mind paying the little extra to play in a truly active enviroment,
whether it be EQ or Q3a.
