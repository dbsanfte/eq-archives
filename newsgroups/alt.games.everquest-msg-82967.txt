Not *entirely* true. Once you get to level 50 (the maximum is 60) you
can start putting experience into "alternate advancement skills" which
are rather like Diablo skill trees. Instead of gaining levels (general
power) you begin to gain specialist skills - rangers can go down
the archery master path, paladins can get a holy steed, warriors can
learn combat fury or enrage, and so on.

Unless you're a very hardcore player , though, you can expect a lot
of time to pass before you reach 50.
