Lately, not much. I have recently borrowed KOTOR from a friend.

KOTOR, for the heathens, is Knights of the Old Republic, the XBox Star Wars 
(Non-MMO)RPG. It kicks much ass.

Usually, though, I am on around 11pm-2-3am GMT -0800.

My old main was Wasain Kurasawa- I think we ran across each other once in 
that guise, but I can't remember off the top of my head.
