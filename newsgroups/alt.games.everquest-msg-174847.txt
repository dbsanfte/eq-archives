It was more than somewhat abusable. Wasn't long before the griefers 
started camping the starting bind points in newbie zones.

I did have a few memorable experiences on both sides of the coin.
Crushbone was absolutely nutty on Test during the height of the
MPC craze. And one time my wife (necro) and I (druid), both
level 40ish, went into Kerra Ridge for some reason and found 
the zone swamped with MPC Kerrans. A few were casting beneficial
spells on us; most stupidly tried to kill us. One was particularly
crafty, probably a PvPer...casting on me from a distance and darting
off. Took me a while to finally catch him with a root and watch him
die slowly.

And I didn't know Bixies were rangers until morphing into one...
