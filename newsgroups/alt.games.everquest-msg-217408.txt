You can get the New Dawn package of Planes of Power from amazon. As someone 
who started playing in June in the UK I'd recommend it.  The time saved 
travelling alone makes it worthwhile.
The other two expansions you will be missing then are Legacy of Ykesha, 
which is downloadable, and the Lost Dungeons of Norath which is the latest 
one.

For anyone looking to play in the UK and not having bought the game at all 
yet, the cheapest way is actually to order Everquest
Evolutions from station.com and have it sent to the UK.  No one
in the UK sells it, I believe because of a resale deal SOE have
with Ubisoft who distribute the New Dawn packs.  Evolutions
contains every expansion except LDoN, and will cost about �45
including the shipping cost via FedEx from the US.  Buying the same in the 
UK will cost around �60 (the registration for Ykesha
is about �16).

There is absolutely no difference between the UK "New Dawn" packs
and the US packs other than the box.

Hope this helps.
