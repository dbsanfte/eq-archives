Started an ogre SK and just got him to 9.  Having done the EC dervs => Oasis
crocs => SK birds grind a couple of times before, I was wondering where an
ogre can go and do the things an ogre has to do (train, buy/sell, bank)
besides Ogguk and Grobb (and possibly Neriak).

Are ogres KOS in Paineel?  How about Halas (I've seen barbs in Ogguk ...
didn't know if the ogres and barbs had an exchange program)?  Or ... should
I just deal with it and stay put. :-)

Any suggestions or advice is always appreciated.

TIA,
Crash
