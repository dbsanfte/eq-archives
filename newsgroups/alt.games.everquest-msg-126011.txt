    The spell gems are supposed to reflect what the spell is better than the
old ones. I imagine in the case of buffs that means each attribute line
(say, a buff with HPs in slot one) will have a unique graphic, so knowing
what you're missing will be trivial and stacking issues should be
transparent. I'll miss the shields, though.
