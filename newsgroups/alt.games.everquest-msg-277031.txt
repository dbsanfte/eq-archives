"As part of Live Update #6, we will be making a significant change to many
items your character may own. The majority of items given to the player as
the result of completing quests will now be flagged as No Trade. This change
will affect existing items as well as those awarded to players going
forward".

This is a very bad move guys! It will remove a lot of the fun and interest 
related to the buying and selling of goods and leave you with a rather bland 
and boring market. No more logging in just to see if there is a bargain to 
be had in the market place or checking to see if the quested piece you 
didn't need has sold yet!

In essence it will split the game into two groups. The Uber always on the go 
super well equipped raiders and the rest -  probably the grey majority 
grinding away in their 'simple homespun' market bought equipment!

Making the items atuneable should have been sufficient.
