I have the good fortune to actually see this setup a couple
times a week - my buddy has a way about him - and there are
a couple of ladies who group with him/us all the time - one
a 60 druid, the other a 60 shaman.  Add in our 53 'bot cleric,
and we have massive healing.  This may be where communication
has broken down between me and you and the past - given the
surfeit of healing, and the old T-rod, my DPS was enormous.
OTOH - I think you, with a raid orientation, see healing as
the bottleneck in - and not to be wasted on mere mage mana.
