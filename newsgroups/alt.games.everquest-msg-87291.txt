So I don't get hit so much?  With that, I can toe-to-toe blues and
whites and come out with *maybe* one bub of health gone.  But i'm open
to other suggestions for that slot instead!

Forgot about that was on my work machine.  Went out and found v3.11.
So sung, that thing is a whopping 12 per pulse?!?  Gads, that sucks.
27 with my instrument is good to know when not swinging swords...
Hmmm, need to find something better there too.
Lol - Fufils get's me to 13.  Both are minus 10 mob AC.

It may be more efficient, but it sure seems to take longer... and I'm
practicing on cyans/blues until I can get the timing down better.  I
usually charm one, sic him on the other with hot key (/pet attack or,
if close, /pet guard me) and then put chains on the other.  When charm
breaks, the one that runs to me fastest gets re-charmed and sent back
out.  Lather, rinse, repeat.
That about right?

Do I stay in there swinging during all this - or sit comfortably away
and keep 'em fighting and minimizing getting smacked around?  If the
former, they die quicker.  If the latter, takes much longer to kill
the first but I don't take much damage.

Advice noted.  Gotta practice a helluva lot more before heading to
Rathe or Oasis.  :-)

[1]Say, I notice you ducked the bit about CHA and effect on bard
charming.  Your thoughts?
