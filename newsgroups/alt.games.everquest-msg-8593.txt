If you're giving away free crack, I'd be shocked if you ever waited more
than two minutes to get in a group unless the zone was completely empty.
The group I was running in the warrior room in HHK last night had, at one
point, myself, a paladin, a chanter, wizard, wizard, shaman.  The casters
were all on crack and the wizards were starting to nuke before the gobs
were even down to 50% health. I barely had time to hit them for any
noticeable damage before they just exploded.  :-)
  I never used to understand the role of / need for enchanters in groups.
The higher level I get, the more I realize that they may just be the most
important member of the party when you suddenly have a half dozen pickclaw
warriors and raiders trying to stick it in your ass.
