I am having a problem with autojoin.  Actually the problem is
un-autojoining.  ages ago, i did /autojoin <channel> for a guild channel.
That particular channel is no longer used, but every time i startup EQ i
still join it.  i have tired /autojoin<channel> again, i read that the
command again will take it off the list.  It did not.  I went thu the ini
files, found the auto join entry, delted it, saved the file, and it STILL
autojoined me the next time i logged in.
Any ideas on how to fix this?

Thanks
Lee
