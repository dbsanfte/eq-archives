Hehe!

That's true. I built this beast back in 1998. The soundcard and 
Videocard I updated in 2001

The only problem I have is the 384MB limit on the motherboard.

I was loathed to change it as it had a full 2MB L2 CPU cache.

As most programmes don't require more than 256MB I lived with the limit 
because the cache gives more mileage.

I am gathering the parts for an AMD 64 beast.

I had been waiting for XPlite to become available. Well as it has just 
been released as Version 1.0 Gold I'll be starting construction soon.

I'll most likely make this beast into a fileserver or dedicated Linux 
firewall and browser.

I understand it is not the bees knees, but I if I can get a framerate of 
32 in Unreal Tournament 2003 or 48 in Original Unreal Tournament with 
most of the bells and whistles on.

Then EQ should be able to give me a similar performance as my machine is 
above the minimum spec?

Anyway I am trying the Pixelshading=FALSE

tonight to see if that helps.
