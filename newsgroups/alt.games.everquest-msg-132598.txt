Say what?  You're suggesting that people with vague flu-like symptoms 
should have instinctively realized they were carrying the next worldwide 
plague, and be punished for not knowing?

Not to mention which, if they were somehow culpable, they already have a 
fatal wasting disease.  Somehow I think that's about punishment enough.

But no, I didn't catch the news.  Cite?
