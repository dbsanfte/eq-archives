Wasn't that about the time when they stopped some bug that allowed for
instant PLing of a character? I had just started playing, but there were
a number of posts about somebody who was going to delete a post fifty
character. They attacked guards or whatever and left a pile of unrezzed
corpses all over the place. Then started a new character of that same
name and got rezzed about ten times for some insane amount of xp and/or
levels?

If it's the same bug, it may have been tied into that one. There's
supposed to be some sort of timer or lock on the re-use of names now,
but I don't recall the particulars. That was a while back. Maybe 99 or
early 2000?
