Oh yes, this figurehead with no power had absolutely nothing at all to do
with his party's electoral sweep.  Nothing at all, it was just a random
even, who know why it happened, right?  Sure, he campaigned a little, sure,
he chose candidates, sure, he targeted certain races - but that didn't have
any impact, did it?

Oh yes, the people who have always underestimated him are laughing away
today, aren't they.

or wait - what's that sound?  I think the laughing is coming from his
*Supporters* today, not his detractors - you think that could be?  What
are the odds?

Oh yes, focus on style, ignore substance.  Looks to me like the electorate
focused on substance and ignored style.  Who thought the voters could be 
that smart?

Yes, it looked like that's what the electorate said yesterday, doesn't it?

It's not my fault you're so out of touch with the mainstream of this country.
Maybe you should move.

If you can demonstrate why you're not an unprincipled foolish boob
I'd be interested in hearing it.

If you want to maintain that you have anything except hatred and vitriol 
to offer, there's no common ground for discussion.

Come to think of it, there isn't any common ground for discussion.

Enjoy your lifetime membership as a member of the bitter lunatic fringe.

NBC's Tim Russert: Now, you said in The New York Times last week, "Jeb
Bush is gone." You want to take those words back? McAuliffe: Of course
not. I've very excited about what's going on in Florida. Russert: He's
going to lose guaranteed? McAuliffe: Yep. That is why the president
was down there yesterday for his 13th visit. People in Florida are
energized. They've already started the early voting. And if you look
at Broward and Dade counties, there are lines already, huge lines,
people--record vote coming out in Florida... we are going to win
Florida which is going to set us up, Tim, very nicely for 2004.
