I just got my Bard to 17th level now....my druid is now 18th level on a
different sever was lucky to get int some good groups, but the bad part is
no one auto split and was greedy.  I know soloing take time but know the
right place to solo is what I need to know for both chars.  Plus I am in
need on makeing platium so I can get better gear mine is sucking bad LoL.  I
am slowly learning the ways I take it, but any advice would be good.  I also
need to know where the Bard drops in this events that are going on.  I am
killing things for rogues wars pallys and casters, but none for my class.
Any help would be grateful...

Erich
