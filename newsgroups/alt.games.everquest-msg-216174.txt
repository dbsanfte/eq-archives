I have run into players like that.  Maybe it was the case before SOE changed how they handled GMs on the servers but at
least since the change, unless the person griefing you in question actually says something incrimidating and you manage
to get it into a /report, you are SOL using /petition on them.

I suspect it was always that way but without dedicated GMs who know something of a particular server's population,
enforcement of the SOE play nice policy is much more difficult.

Two recent examples include:

Our guild fought up to one of the BoT tower lords and is rebuffing after clearing locals when a bard shows up and
preceeds to train the lord on us.  We managed to survive with about half of the raid blown off of the platform do to aoe
and such so it took us about an hour to regroup.  The bards corpse is there and he is in a known guild so I first ask
him to explain himself.  He responded with a statement about his family in Freeport so I contacted an officer in his
guild (he was in zone to rez the bard coincidentally) who basically said they could care less about the conflict between
us and their bard and that it was up to us to resolve it.  Not having anything to resolve (I had already asked the bard)
we petitioned for zero effect.  Needless to say, that entire guild is on my "do not cooperate under any circumstances
until I see them in hell" list.

My other example is a player on the server who has enough accounts and systems to run her own group.  She makes a habit
of hitting known spawns like Lodi and using her enchanter to agro wipe in combination with nuking from her bots to KS a
variety of timed named spawns.  She never responds or says anything in game while doing this and from what I gather from
others, has been going about it for 2 years or more.
