That sounds immensely dull.

After 3 years I think Sui has levelled in every zone in the game with
the possible exceptions of splitpaw and the deep (I've
just not spent enough time there) and the obvious "raid" zones.

I cant even remember the order.... for my more recent alts..

KittieRogue (no, not the name in game ;) ) shar vahl, shadeweavers,
hollowshade, paludal

Necro Nektulos, Commons, Sro, Paludal (While this is a little "ick"
in becoming the latest LOIO newbie PL zone the proximity of
bankers who dont KOS my TeirDal self on sight or force me to
bank twenty zones away is worth it to me ;) )

Druid hrmmm... GFay, Crushbone, BB, Misty thicket, Skarana, Runnyeye, 
Xorbbs gorge, Cazic Thule (prenerf), Iceclad, Eastern wastes, Crystal
caverns, Tower of frozen shadow (her current playground)

TOFS is awesome fun actually, and very rarely occupied.
