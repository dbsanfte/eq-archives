EQ really isn't set up for the most reasonable solution since its level
based rather than skill based in nature.  In a skill based environment
you can have both concealment and perception skills to deal with the
issue, though the fact that a very high perception skill somehow allows
you to ID something you've never heard of still doesn't sit well with
me.  Perhaps if you fail your skill roll you get nothing, if you make
your roll you get a description but no name unless you've previously
held such an item or IDed it using Identify when in another's hands.  Or
add in something akin to an arcane knowledge skill as well, which allows
you to study things before you see them so you will know them when you
do.  If you make your perception roll on an item tagged as obscure and
you haven't IDed it previously you have to make an arcane knowledge roll
to get full info, then it would be added to your list of known items.  
Such a system makes more sense in terms of roleplay, though as I say it
isn't something you could just slap onto EQ and would probably annoy the
heck out of the poor programmer who had to make it all happen in what
ever game tried it.
