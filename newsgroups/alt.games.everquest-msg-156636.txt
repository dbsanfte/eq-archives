Running OOM does not = dying.  Dying comes from running
OOHP!  While you do get a slightly higher kill rate from more
mana, because you don't occaisionally go OOM and have to
abandon your kill, its not all that much higher, since you'll only
do this a couple times before realizing you are aiming a little
too high; efficient killing comes when your mana rate doesn't
depend on sitting on your butt a lot; using a portion of your
mana up that you can regen while your puller is bringing in
the next mob, things like that.

High mana pool is most useful when reaching beyond your
means, say to kill a quest mob or a named that drops some
amazing piece of loot.  Now you don't care about efficiency,
you care about capability, sit for ten minutes afterwards no
big deal.

Focus items, on the other hand, will count every fight, every
time.  Make your big kill easier (10% cheaper spells is
like a 10% larger pool) and make your down time shorter
on every kill (because you used 10% less mana so you have
10% less sitting to do)

Mana regen items are almost as powerful, they don't make
your big kill all that much easier, since you only get the added
mana during the short time of the kill itself, but they too cut
your down time on every single kill, every time.

Leveling faster by marginal twinking like this doesn't hurt your skills
as a caster.  You cast spells 10% faster... but you still cast just
as many to kill a mob. You med up 10% faster... but you still cast
just as many spells per exp point.  Plus there is no need for you to
get your casting skills up in combat anyway, they go up just as fast
if you chain cast your cheapest spell in that line in the safety of some
mob free area of your nearest newbie zone.

The skills that suffer from PLing and twinking are defense, offence,
and other melee skills.  I'd almost reccomend a steady course of
PLing via druid for a young twink as a remedy, though, with regen,
HP buffs, and a DS you can level up astonishingly fast while doing
probably more melee than you ever would as an "untwinked" caster;
let the mob beat on you, and beat back with the fastest weapon you
can find, and watch your melee skills soar.

If you are interested in getting skills up fast, though, a high int/wis
does help in that endeavor, so we are back to square one, with
the 255 int "newbie" being better off after all.
