52 and wanting to get flagged? Am I the only one who see the problem there?

Well, starting at 52, you've got plenty of time before you will need to 
worry about having it. Seriously, why would you be looking at the trials 
before late 50's anyway?

How would that change the concept? Nada. I understand it's a long road 
through the 50's. What I don't understand is why people think they must be 
flagged for zones in which they really aren't even high enough level to 
make much contribution.
