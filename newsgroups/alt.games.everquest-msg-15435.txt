Because its extremely nerfed. Verant treats bard as "fruity" class.  Played
to 31, read all these supposed great guides on soloing and found out its
running in circles for 30mins to take out a blue at best or getting low
charm gear in hopes resists will actually not happen every other time.
Guess having MS does not help with only class I liked in EQ either, but even
"normal " people are disgusted with it... Why nearly even bard you see left
are only twinks wearing stuff 40 levels before they should, sadly they need
it to surive.
You'll answer your own question soon enough, when your twink gear does no
longer make it almost even fight.
