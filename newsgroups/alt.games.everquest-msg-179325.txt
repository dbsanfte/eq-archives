    More like world shaft. Here's just some of the hilarity that will come
on LoY release date:

(1) People with baby trolls created before today will log them on and get
ganked by frogs before they can say "Mommy!"
(2) People with evil characters logged in Grobb will log them on and get
ganked by frogs before they can say "Mommy!"
(3) Trolls that killed dark elves because hey, you don't need that faction,
will find out they can never go back to use their cultural forge without an
invisibility potion. Assuming the cultural forge is moved.
(4) New trolls will find out that the zone leading deeper into their new
city is even more dangerous to them than the zone to the wide open world.
Assuming they don't get stuck in some of the doorways in their new home and
camp out of frustration.
(5) New trolls will also find out that all their newbie quests involve going
to Innothule swamp, since they weren't coverted over. Well, except for the
quest with the fire beetle eyes - that will have been changed.
(6) New trolls will also find out that once they level past level 10 or so
they'll either have to challenge some of the fire-using casters in Nek
forest, or go and fight the fire-using denizens of Lavastorm. Oh, did anyone
remember the 5 base fire resist on a troll?
(7) If there is EVER a new server, look for all sorts of hilarity as two
different races share one newbie zone. "I'd train to guards, but I can't
move!"

    Just when I thought the programmers couldn't get any lamer, along comes
Gukta. "We don't need to make a new city, a new zone connection, or a new
newbie zone - just shuffle some NPCs around!" Goodbye, Sutok and Ootok -
we'll miss you dearly.
