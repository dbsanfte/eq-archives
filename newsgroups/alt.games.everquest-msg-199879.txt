Yep, the best MY bard can do.
I think the main problem is that instead of putting my 25 extra points
into STR, they were spread. So part of the problem is that I can not
follow standrd bard chr recipes. I'm playing a few alts (war, ranger)
where I put those 25 pts into str and am just amazed at the difference.
I would have never attacked anything with 30% HP in my bard, but the
wood elf ranger easily cleans up light blue at 30% (lvl 7 atm).

Also compounded by only having a 28.8 modem dial up link, with ping
times up to 2,000 ms, which really makes any battle risky. Kind of
"spewing last few days as ping times have been <500ms consistently, but
I couldn't log in. Fixed now.

I think what I really need is a new place to pick up groups in my
timezone. Not helped by being restricted to classic everquest, but
managing.

I keep lurking (mostly) and learning.
