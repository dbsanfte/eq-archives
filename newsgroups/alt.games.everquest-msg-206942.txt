According to the parsed spdat info on Lucy they are identical in
effect and duration:  66% spell haste, 40 AGI, 3 STA regen, 12 AC
(one also shows a 0/tick STA loss that smacks of sloppy database
editing).  Also, their text:  "Your body pulses with the speed of
the Shissar.", is identical (not that that matters).
