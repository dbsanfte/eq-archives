Okay, how can I NOT know exactly what a classes spells can do, what
their abilities can do, and interact in the game and with other
classes after reading a guide that has explained in-depth just that? A
guide (or numerous sources) that explain how to apply tactics with a
class in various situations. You're so full of elitist bullshit it's
sad.

Once again, there is a difference between knowing the mechanics of a
class and being adept at applying them. And, sorry, no, knowing
everything there is to know about pianos doesn't mean you're talented
in playing them, that's completely ignorant to say it does.
