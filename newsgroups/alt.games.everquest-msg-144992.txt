I'd definitely go with 98SE. It uses far less resources, is faster for 
playing games, has less compatability problems and generally has more 
mature drivers available for it.

I use WinME and have relatively few stability issues. For example, last 
weekend my machine was running EQ for over 24 hours non stop. Most of 
this was in the bazaar but there were still quite a few hours of playing 
time.
