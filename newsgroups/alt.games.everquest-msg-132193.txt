You might have missed the point there...

I believe he means that during the trade, the one being scammed goes to
put an item in the Trade window --- at _that_ point, the scammer cancels the
trade, so when the "scammed" clicks.... the item will be put on the ground.
(i.e. they "miss" the trade window).

However, "Confirm drop?" is on by default.
