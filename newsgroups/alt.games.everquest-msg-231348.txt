 >I must admit I thought farmers just sold all they got
 >for platinum.

I'm only slightly knowledgeable in sellable farmable
items, but from what I know, there really aren't a
large amount of items that fall off the low levels that
will give level 50's and above enough money to make it
worth their while, IMO. At least there aren't for me.
I know people will point out things like silks and
swirling shadows and bone chips and, yes, I do sell them
occasionally in the bazaar when I get them, but to go
out and farm them for the express purpose of selling
them, it's just not worth it for me.

The only farming I do is for skilling up purposes and
that is required at the level I am in some of the skills
when you factor in my financial status. As an example,
I'm at 207 in fletching. At this point, it's either
spend a ton of cash on components to make bows (not really
an option for me), do cultural fletching (also not an
option since I'm a half elf follower of Tunare <and, yes,
I know that's a bad choice. First character with no know-
ledge of these things led me to that choice>) or do X-
tipped acrylia arrows to get higher. Someone has to do
the farming of two substances for this. Acrylia is fairly
common in the bazaar but prices are high. I only rarely
see anyone selling the substances for the arrowheads and
I don't remember ever seeing it in the amounts I need.
(For instance, to get from 202 to 207 in fletching, I've
done at least 300 combines. That's a lot of combines.)
IF there were enough people of the appropriate levels
farming this stuff and offering it at prices that wouldn't
bankrupt me, I would be perfectly willing to buy the items
instead of farming them. But they're not. :)

And as far as selling the items for plat, I haven't found
that the amount of money I can get for most items you can
make while skilling up is worth the time I've spent getting
the ingredients.
