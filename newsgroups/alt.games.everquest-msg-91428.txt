All I want to know is what's so cool about star wars. The idea of
several thousand jedi knights running around looking for things
to lightsaber sounds seriously lame. In addition firearms and
modern environments just don't have the same pull for me as a
fantasy environment.

I just can't see anything I would care to be, or do, in that
world. Of course i'll be very interested to see how it develops
once it actually releases.
