Annoying things in EQ:
#1 biggest: When buying stacks of things or trading plat why cant i just
enter a number in that count box, why do i have to use the arrows or scroll
bar. Pain in the ass!

#2 Hot Keys: First off why can 1 lone only be like 40 characters or whatever
it is. Thats so lame. and second if you make a type and want to change it
when you click on the line the whole dam line dissapears and you have to
retype it. A big FU to whoever programmed that code.
