Yes, that's lovely and all, except that it does not work if you are out of 
assist range of the mob (you know, back where casters usually wold pull 
from).  So it's not just a single keystroke... it's racing up to assist 
range, making the keystroke, racing back, then waiting for your spell to 
cast, which of course gives the warrior you were racing to the mob plenty 
of time to go in and engage it and whine about you KSing him.  And still 
not being sure if you were actually within assist range... for certain 
giant-sized mobs, the difference between the range at which assist will 
work and the range at which the giant will turn around and squish you is 
very small.

Fuck it.  I'll tash it, and if it doesn't come to me at full speed, it 
must be engaged. :)
