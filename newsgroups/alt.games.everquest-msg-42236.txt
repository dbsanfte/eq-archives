I am returning to my home town Halas.  As a warrior I have reached 95 skill
in both slash weapons.  I would like to check out Permafrost seeing how it
is as low as LV15 and I'm just over 1 bubble away from 19 (was slightly
closer but will explain that later).  What weapon should I use?  1H slash or
2H slash?  What are the chances of me finding someone to buy a langseax from
(would 2 to duel wield with be good idea)?  How much should I be willing to
pay (for single or maybe slightly more if can find 2?)?

Next question.  Why was I attacked and then killed by a Aquagoblin's pet
(pretty sure that's the name) in Lake Rathe (near middle of lake is where he
started to attack, about center between the 4 islands, killed me just before
I reached the NW island)?  He conned indifferent to me, EVEN WHILE KILLING
ME!  He also conned green (but took some pretty good damage).  Now my
biggest surprise was that I couldn't out swim him with swim skill of 95 and
also with SoW at the same time (might have been a pound or two over weight,
STR=133, might have had 135-140 but that's it).
