> Dont forget Monks may have higher caps but they have piss poor AC

In comparison to who?   I am in no way at all uber, and I don't even compare
to some other monks in my guild, but at a raid im at 4.5k hp, 1250ac ish,
guild leader (monk) beats several of our warlords for HP and AC, as does the
raid leader (monk)

What is your opinion is good ac/hp? (and remember AC is just 1 part of the
equasion, along with ripose, block, parry, dodge, etc etc)
