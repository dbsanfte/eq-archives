Well you have now, even if by proxy.  For what it's worth he did even
more damage versus Zlandicar last night, around 18k/minute we think.

Utter rubbish.  I can get well over 1500 ATK with Avatar, the stacking
issues only caused a loss of 40 (Warders and CoP no longer stack so
you lose CoP.)  The fact is that high end Rangers who are not tanking
a mob can easily do more damage with Archery than Melee WITHOUT using
disciplines.  They *choose* to use Archery over Melee as they *know*
it does much more damage, surely this tells you something..

Rangers can self buff ATK better than anyone, Avatar helps Rogues
'more' than anyone else (the above inflated figures apply to Rogues
and backstab) as they cannot buff ATK themselves without other classes
or Avatar procs.

"Certain circumstances" would be limited to anywhere the Ranger isn't
tanking the mob (which almost never happens unless he's solo or the
only melee present) or the mob's model is rammed into a wall and he's
forced to melee due to coding issues.
