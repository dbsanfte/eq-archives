I have this set up for my bard and it works great.  I forage far far more
than I ever did on any of my other foraging characters, enough that I
don't need to buy food or water even though I'm a Vah Shir (double
normal eating and drinking)

In combat there's no problem, as you get the "cannot forage while attacking"
message.

There have been a couple occurances where I was pulling, hadn't activated
attack, and foraged one of the rare "no drop" items that I couldn't just
ditch easily.  Not that hard to hit I, drop on my picture, and hit done, though.

As a result of this I took forage to cap and sense heading up to my cap per
level in just a couple levels, while on my own (hitting forage/sense heading
while
working up bind wounds) I barely got up to ten in either in around 30 levels.
