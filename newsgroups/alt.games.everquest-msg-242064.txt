Known bug - not sure of a fix.  If you die to a DoT (Poison, Disease or 
drowning) it is still on you when you pop at your bind point.  People
are death looping to it, as you are.  Fortunately you're low enough level
to not lose xp from it - some folks have lost huge amounts of xp.  For
right now, just don't play the cleric.  Maybe todays patch will fix it.
