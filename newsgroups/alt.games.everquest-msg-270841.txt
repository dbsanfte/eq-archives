Hell.. forget maintenance a year down the road. Really good spahgetti 
rears its ugly head with its quirky impossible to trace bugs long before 
you finish developing the first working version. :)

I recently ported some algorithms coded in Visual Basic to C#. Took me a 
month to figure out what was going on. Unitialized variables, "goto:" 
statements everywhere and the -worst- possible imaginable abuses of 
structured programming accomplished with them (we're not talking about 
simply short ciruiting for/while loops, we're talking 90% of flow 
control: "functions" with multiple entry/exit points including just 
flowing from the previous code or flowing into the code afterwards in 
addition to hopping around and between them via goto: statements, and 
then there was all the goto: statements for looping, conditional 
branching), using visible=false fields on the main form for function 
'parameters' and global variables in the few functions there were, 
unreachable code, duplicated code, duplicated variables (variables that 
were set to the same value and used interchangeably) code that had no 
effect...computed values that never got used before being overwritten 
with a completely new value, reusing variables for completely different 
purposes at different stages, inconsistent variable naming, multiple 
variables used to store the same value...

I wish I could post the source code. Its the worst stuff I have *ever* 
seen being used. (It was a medical system no less.)
