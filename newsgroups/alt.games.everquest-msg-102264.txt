Star Wars Galaxies is due out which would cross swords (or lightsabers) and
some more basic fighting (think ewoks and gungans) with more advanced
weapons. Not sure of the release date , but my brother (who works for Sony
and is an avid EQer) says it blows EQ out of the water on the internal test
servers. The only dis-advantage I guess is that you have to like Star Wars,
or at least be in a position where you don't loath it.
