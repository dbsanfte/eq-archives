   A couple of years ago I whacking rats in the Freeport newbie yard with on of
my many alts on Drinal.  There was a level 50 warrior in full plate standing
near the gate, shouting repeatedly for money to go buy better armor.  I ran up
and gave him two copper, telling him I understood how hard it was to not have
any funds. 

 I played it perfectly straight.  Too straight, as it turned out.  I think my
intended irony was lost on him, however. He ended up giving me all the copper he
had on him, about 2 gold's worth, and acted like I should be wowed by that hugh
sum.  And keep right on shouting.
