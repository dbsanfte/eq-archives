Any tips on role playing a high elf?  best I can figure is to
basically "be an ass". I recently made one, a cleric, on a new server.
I always thought the high elves were more like Vulcans from Star Trek,
but more I read, it seems like they are jerks. In character of course.

When I hang out around Crushbone, i've been know to randomly heal and
buff people, even non high elves.  Help save folks from trains, etc.
Is this what a high elf would do? I don't think a vulcan would, unless
it directly affected them.

Also I follow Tunare, but I don't see my character or other high elves
camping out in the woods for very long.  They don't seem like the
rugid type.

Maybe I should have made a Quellious Erudite
