if want to end up with a Barb pally then why start in FP? ... just make him 
a good aligned character and start in Qeynos it'll save you doing the 
betrayal quest. If you want to stay with your buddies and hunt with them 
then you're going to either have to be a shadowknight or wait until you're 
high enough level as a pally to hunt in the zones common to both evil and 
good races. You can't be a paladin with FP as your home town.
