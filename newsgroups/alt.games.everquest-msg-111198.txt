What I'd like to know is, have they improved on the medding at all.
That was always what i hated in eq. When you have to med mana back for
10-15mins it's just ridiculous. 

For those who care I played eq for a year and a half before i quit.
and recently i play dark age of camelot and was bored of it 2-3months
after.
