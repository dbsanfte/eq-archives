    It replaces "You have been healed for X damage" with "Soandso has healed
you for X damage". No extra lines of spam, unless your healer is named
Reallylongnamebecauseihatetellsforbuffs. And it helps with people that
analyze logs, as you can see exactly where healing broke down and who was
AFK. ;-)

    Again, the parsers will be happy. For most of us it'll be just another
feature to turn off. ;-)

    The post-50 mage pets do, yeah. They're the only ones I know of that are
actually wizards, and not warriors-with-a-proc.

    Yeah, CoD used to be my relaxation XP spot. Not any more, especially
after they revamp the loot like they said they would in the Producer's
Letter. It's already pretty nice stuff. I can't imagine the graveyard being
full in Torment, though, because I can't imagine people staying in Torment.
Zone in, take a screenshot, and remember what the Torment music sounds like
so you can find it in your EQ directory. There, you have now experienced the
best features of Torment.

    At least the trains can only be so large thanks to the anti-bard code.
Before, once a train hit the zone area, it was always dragged into the
graveyard and it took forever to get rid of it. Hard for a cleric to make
money while dodging suits of armour!

    This change promises to be the most amusing of all of them. ;-)

    Naw. Somebody has to have cruddy effects on their pants, just so we know
who to pass over when awarding them!

    After two and a half years of waiting? Yeah.
