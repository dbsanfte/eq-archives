My understanding has always been that hate is generated not just by how 
much damage you do, but also incremented each time you hit. I imagine 
that comparing a 35/35 weapon with a great many 1hs weapons my show 
differently, due to the sheer damage it does.

I'd be just as pleased to see evidence to the contrary though. I would 
much rather be wrong and end up with the correct information.

Yup. Always the lowest priority and the faster ones (that I can afford) 
don't do an adequate amount of damage at the level you can finally make 
time for working on it.
