Strange, all the women I know are multi-orgasmic.  *cough*


>Annie <--- Has a battery... now what?

I thought this one would be obvious.  You show it to your
lover, then say, "if you don't go down on me for the next
thirty minutes, I'm going to beat you senseless with this
battery."

This works best with the big blocky 6-volt batteries -- you'll
only get laughed at if you whip out a AAA; proving yet
again that size really does matter.
