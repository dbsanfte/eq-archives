Faction with the specific gnomes that sell them goes up relatively fast when
hunting in Sol B.

So, I guess it depends on why you want them... if it's for your main
character, it shouldn't be a problem by the time you've saved up all that
plat.  If you're looking to twink your Iksar newbie, you might be in for a
rough time of it.

And I believe they are sold in Sol A, not Sol B.
