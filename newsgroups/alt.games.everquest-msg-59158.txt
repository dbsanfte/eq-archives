Ok, thanks, that's all any intelligent reader needs to know to
accurately assess the value of your statements on the matter.

An observation I can't ignore though... when the fanboys were in here
announcing how DAoC was going to kill EQ, even before it was released,
that was sad and pathetic. But by making negative claims about the
game, when you've never even played it, you've got those fanboys beat.

>I will not set foot in any game with mandatory PvP

As a number of people who have actually *played* the game, and who are
therefore infinitely better informed than you, have stated, PvP is
*not* mandatory in DAoC. If it were, I wouldn't be playing it, because
I don't like PvP myself.

>It is perfectly fair, though, to note what the company says

Your interpretation of those statements is... unique.
