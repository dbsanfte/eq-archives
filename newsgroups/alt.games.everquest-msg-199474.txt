If you have LoY then I would suggest you run NOT walk but RUN to Gunthak.
Your 40's will literally FLY by there. Solo or in a group you should be
pulling in amazing Exp, and quite decent cash as well. Im not real familiar
with mages at your level, but Id be willing to wager that with just a touch
of dedication you could get to 44 from 40 in a single weekend, easily. My
little warrior got from 24% into level 49 to 20% into 50 in less than 6
hours time there. Exp is simply that good.
