You arent at all concerned that this is going to generate a fanclub of
perverts around your child whenever shes playing?
sure... it might look fun and innocent.. but you leave for one second to
take a piss and bam.. and army of pervs shows up.



Thats just the attention getter... heres the real message..

Dont waste sony's time with bullshit please, I would much rather stop
getting stuck in walls than be notified that there is a child in the zone.

besides that a member of my guild has a 9 y/o that plays a warrior, better
than most adults do, doesnt talk much.. but neither do I.
