Per Mr. Clancy's post, monks get no natural stun attack until lvl 59.
However, when you start getting up in levels, you'll notice a high
tendancy to quad hit more frequently than your comtemporary melees.
Quad hits plus a successful kick give you a pretty good chance of
interrupting spells.  It's not very good, but it's the best we have so
far.
