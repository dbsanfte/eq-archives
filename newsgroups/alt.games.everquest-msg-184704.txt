If Sony doubled the processing power and bandwidth of all its servers,
you can damn well expect that fewer people would get dropped. 
Guaranteed.  So yes, even though GM's aren't getting online and
choosing random players to kick, Sony is indeed booting people to save
costs.

Since they 'fixed' their bandwidth management, I have many more
problems where I go 99 percent LD (cannot open doors, touch ports,
receive tells, etc...but never a 'you have been disconnected').  I
don't get booted, but my connection is full red with 100% dropped (or
whatever the percentage on your net graph is)  The quickest way to
solve this seems to be to cast any spell.  I cast SOW and boom, green
connection bar.  It seems an awful lot like they are prioritizing
bandwidth somehow.  If you are deemed a non-essential user (just
medding, not attacking, not casting) you start to drop a lot more
packets.

This appears to be some kind of imperfect rationing system...imperfect
because it _appears_ to cause more LD.
