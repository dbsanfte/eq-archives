Generally speaking, EQ does the same thing, I think; that is, the zone 
lines are usually inside the zone boundaries, and what you see on the 
other side resembles what you see when you zone in.  On occaision I've 
somehow failed to zone and ended up in the fake visuals areas; even 
managed to do it reliably enough in KC to use it as an exploit of sorts, 
a resting place 100% free of the trains which were ubiquitous there back 
in the day.

You certainly aren't looking at things deep in the zone, or two zones 
over, but zone lines are rarely a blank wall with no clue whats past it 
(exceptions being places like the Stonebrunt/Gunthak line where clicking 
on a door zones you)

I find zone lines to be an annoying construct of game limitations, and 
would in theory love to see them abolished entirely; I shouldn't stop 
and wait in the middle of running from here to there, and mobs certainly 
shouldn't stop following me due to my crossing some invisible line in 
the sand, much less forget all about me if I cross back in.

NWN has "zone" transitions, which usually annoy with the loading pause 
problem but which only sometimes cause the mobs to stop following; 
frequently they'll zone with you and even when they don't its rare 
they'll forget what you were doing to them if you zone back in.  Of 
course they also only have to maintain "memory" for at most 64 players 
at a time.
