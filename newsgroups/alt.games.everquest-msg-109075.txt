OK, I see what you and DT are saying.  My point, and I believe that kaev is
making this point as well, is that there is a good and evil outside what we
believe.  In other words, we can be doing things we think are good, and
still be doing evil.  Someone else can be doing something that we think is
evil, but is actually good.  It goes along with the idea of subjective
realities and perception.

My own take is that there is only one reality, and it's the same for
everyone.  Our perceptions are filters that obscure our vision of reality.
Learning is cleaning that filter, so that eventually our perception is in
line with reality.  I think this goes the same with good and evil.  We all
have sets of values that we hope match objective good and evil.  When we
find our values aren't quite appropriate, we adjust them to clean the
filter.  Augh, I'm rambling and making no sense, aren't I?

True, but whether we put others ahead of our self interest has alot to do
with whether or not we are acting in a good or evil way.  When we put our
wants above others' rights, I think we're on the wrong side of that line.
When we sacrifice our wants for the needs of others, I think we're acting
for good.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
