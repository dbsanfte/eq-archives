Guys.  GetsumJ is an ass.  Everybody knows this.  Responding to his
every goddamned post proves nothing.  The only thing it does is
encourage him.  And then he'll start yet new threads.

Want to annoy him, ignore him.  He won't have whole threads about
himself to masturbate over then and he'll go away to seek abuse
somewhere else.

You're not going to change monkeyboy by responding, all you're going
to do is raise the noise in the newsgroup.

Just let it fucking go.
