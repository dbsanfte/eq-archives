If you're still in OT, you could give Dalnir's Crypt a try.  It's near the
shoreline in Warslik's Woods, so you're pretty close already.  I understand
some decent monk armor drops there as well, so there may be even more
incentive for you to check that one out.  The ranger will be slightly
limited on spell selection, but I think you'll like the place all the same.

If you're willing to travel to Velious, you could go after cougars in
Iceclad.  I am not a big fan of them, but some people are.  They
occasionally drop the cougar claw earring, a nice item for your level.  One
other factor in hunting here is that melees can be bound on the dock.

If you try Iceclad and don't like it, within the zone is a very impressive
looking tower.  It's the Tower of Frozen Shadow, and is my all-time favorite
zone.  You could probably start in the ground floor of the zone at your
level.  This one is so interesting to me because you sort of grow into the
zone.  There are 7 levels in the tower, each protected by a lock.  This
means you must hunt the floor you are on until you get a key to the next
floor.  They are not soulbound, so you may want to collect a spare set and
bank them as you go up in case of a wipeout.  There are never trains in this
zone, as it is usually pretty empty and because a train maker simply has
nowhere to run.  Some of the loot in this zone is very attractive -- I got a
sorcerous bowl in there, the first time my best single item was something I
had looted rather than bought.

Good hunting.
