A matter of opinion. Mine is clear.

When I want low fantasy, I'll play Quake deathmatch.

I've read a LOT of fantasy (you know, the kind that EQ is derived
from) in my time, and never have I seen a name remotely like that.

Last year I found a blue jay tangled up in some netting. It was caught
by the neck and was struggling madly, but couldn't escape. I picked it
up, and took several minutes to untangle the poor thin. It was not
happy to see me and kept attacking me as I worked, but I did get it
freed of the netting, and released it.

I'd never met the bird before, and indeed it was just a dumb animal.
But sure as shit, I did it a favor.

I've stated it several times before, but I don't mind repeating it for
you... "I follow the rules of the game, and it offends me when others
don't".
