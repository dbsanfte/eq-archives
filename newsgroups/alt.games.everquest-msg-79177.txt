You just have to be in full screen mode to use the transparent
inventory, just typing " i " should pull it up.

Such as in eqclient.ini  :

[Defaults]

ScreenMode=FULL

------------------------------

Use same resolution only means that when you go to the old 640x480 
inventory that if you are in 800 x 600 res you will have that 640 x
480 with a black border around it so its still in 800x600. Otherwise
you actually switch to 640 x 480 usually with a pause. Neither of
those affects transparent inventory or full screen mode but are just a
matter of preference.

And yes, you just install velious into your eq dir and enable it with
the reg code once in game.
