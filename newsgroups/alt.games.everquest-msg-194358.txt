April 25th 2003

On Monday I am buying a new video card I have a Dell computer
Running at 1.6ghrz with a 40 gig hard-drive and 512mb of DDR
Ram.  I also have a 16mb ATI card. but I want to upgrade this
card on monday to the Geforce 4 ti 4200 128mb card. Now I phoned
around to a few place's just to check Price's now the one store told
me they do have the card and that the one they have is an 8X AGP Card.
ok so I decided to take a look at my system specifications before I
went ahead and bought the card here's what I came up with.

Expansion Bus

Bus types---> PCI and AGP
BUS SPEED-->PCI:33MHz,AGP:66MHz
AGP CONNECTOR--->One
AGP CONNECTOR size--->172 pins
AGP Connector data width--->32 bits
AGP Bus Protocol--> 4x/2x modes at 1.5 V

VIDEO AGP 4X

Ok let's say I go ahead and buy the 8x card common sense tell's me it
will not work with the 4x slot. or will it would I notice a drop in
performace. honestly I'm not really sure. I was wondering if you kind
folks out there have any suggestions for me. or can I get the same
card at 4x I'm not really sure any help would be appreciated.
