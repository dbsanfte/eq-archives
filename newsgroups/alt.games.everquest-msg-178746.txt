Not sure but if you don't have PoP or Luclin it could be hard to get
around, AFAIK you have to go through erudin who will hate you.

There's also two groups in qeynos, one will probably KoS you and the
other should like you.  There's a big necro guild in the sewers with a
secret exit out the front that avoids the guards.

My personal preference is for an Iksar necro.  Might as well be REALLY
evil, if you are going necro, also get regen & some ac which will help a
little.  If you've got PoP and Luclin this is definately the way to go,
since the people on Luclin don't care about your race & affiliation, and
you can get there easy with PoP.
