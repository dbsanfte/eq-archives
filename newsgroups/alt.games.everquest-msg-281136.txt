Right click on the map window,click background/texture.The background
of the edge of the window changes,not the map background itself,it
stays light brown without any possibility to change this.
In a lot of zones this makes the maps almost unreadable,because the
lines are drawn in a bright colour,which contrasts hardly perceptible
from the light brown background.
Of course its not a game stopping bug,but pretty annoying.
