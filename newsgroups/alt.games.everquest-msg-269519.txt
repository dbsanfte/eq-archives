Yeah. I'm on an AMD 3000 and 6800 GT 256mb - I have pretty much everything
turned on except environment shadows with character textures at maximum. there
is occasional stuttering but its very playable and it looks *far far far* better
than EQ. 

The alienating comment though, Im not convinced about. Its true you need an
insane PC to run 'bells and whistles' but I know people with very old PC's
who've turned off a lot of details and are playing fine; if you feel alienated
by knowing you're not running the game at 'best level', then running a game
that doesnt look as good, but *cant* look as good is merely putting blinkers
on... saying 'My PC runs WOW at full settings!' is irrelevant if your PC could
run EQ2 at an equivilant level of detail.

I've not played WOW, so I cant do direct comparison, but the screenies I've
seen make it look like a far better executed EQ1 in terms of art; the same
levels of detail but much nicer artistic integrity and 'flow'.
