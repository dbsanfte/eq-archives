Keeping high-end strategies a secret seems to be the norm.  While a guild
raiding deep in PoP or GoD is in competition with only a small percentage of
the playerbase, that competition seems to be fierce.  Secrets are jealously
guarded.  On the Mage Tower board, there was a debate about posting high-end
raid strategies a few months ago.  It got heated in a hurry and the vote was
to not allow it.  Not that I don't enjoy Richard's stories or want him to
stop posting, but I also wonder if he takes heat.
