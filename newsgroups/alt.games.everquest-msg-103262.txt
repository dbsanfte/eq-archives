Find the root that casts fastest, mem it, and have it handy ALL THE TIME.
This is the only self-defense spell you have that don't have really long
recast times.  Max root time means shit when you're trying to stay alive and
there's no MINIMUM root time (that I'm aware of) so you want to get that
bugger cast as fast as possible.

The fastest casting root & a heal are two spells that you should always
always have up.   If you're aggroed just keep on casting root until it
sticks then move away.  That's your only real option if no one is helping
you.

As to the puller, if you have a rogue in your group the puller will want to
pull past him.  If the rogue is huddled with the masses, get his ass out
there in front.  If this wasn't the case I would seriously suggest you warn
the puller that the next time he trains you he'd better pray to GOD that
you're not so mad at him as to "forget" to heal him.

Healing:  don't heal melees to full except with CH.  Don't worry about it.
Always know how many HP your tanks have, know how much your healing spells
do, and don't cast until they NEED it.  Healing any tank at 60% health
during normal fights is a waste of mana if you're a cleric (shaman/druids
may have to).

For god's sakes, if you're kinda low on mana NEVER heal the puller after the
fight until you're ready for him to pull again.
