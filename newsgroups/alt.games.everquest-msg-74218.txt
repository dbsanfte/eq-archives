He's quite easy to kill for even a cleric at level 35 plus. My dark
elf cleric now level 38 (in order to raise primordial malice, though
that stupid quest is still broken) and my 55 druid (in order to raise
the gnome eldrich collective caster faction though she can't seem to
get it above scowl, stupid deepwater cutlass quest ;) )  kill him
constantly whenever in the zone and would kill him more if his spawn
time was not kind of long.

He is something of a hard con though due to his HT and such. At a
level where he was xp you'd likely need 2 characters or more to kill
him. Another thing to remember is his aggro is fairly LARGE so unless
someone is training him around you should be okay if you give where he
is a fairly large circle. Level is of no difference really, since he
happily attacks my 55 druid (starting with his fairly large and
alarming HT ;) ) if she strays anywhere near his large aggro circle.

I'm pretty sure at EVEN he'd dust most characters/classes, especially
if he initiated the combat and started with his HT as he often does,
possibly even when he was blue.
