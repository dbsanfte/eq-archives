UO2 died in development for many of the reasons people have stated here in
other threads. Like: 'If I can not transfer I don't want to play a new game'
or ' Will they continue to support EQ once EQ2 is out?' There were technical
reasons UO2 died too, but I seem to remember some angry players bitching as
well.

I would think EQ will probably be phased out sometime after EQ2 comes out
but I could be wrong. Hard to say at this point because I haven't heard
anything new about that. I personally don't care that I can not bring my
toons over. Once I'm done with a game I'm done and move on to bigger and
better things. I'm done with EQ so I'll just have to see what EQ2 will be
about. I do think they should name it something else though.
