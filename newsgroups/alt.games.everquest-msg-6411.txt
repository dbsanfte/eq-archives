I didn't bother to join the Paladin guild when I first started, now I'm
thinking I would like to try some of the quests. At level 35 is it too late
to join and how would I go about doing it? Is my only option to buy a guild
note from a new player or start one myself and drop/retrieve? I've heard
that some quests I would be unable to do now since I'm at too high a level.
Thanks

Unzar Jones, 35 Pally, Drinal
