I did the first part (up to VS and Jade Reaver) at 48. You'll need friends
to help take down the Dark Reavers in the EK segment, and you'll want
friends for the long Tainted Deepwater Goblin camp.

Tried to solo the Tainted Barracuda in LOiO recently and he beat me up (that
fish does not like to stay rooted).

For VS and Jade Reaver (dropped in CoM) you'll need a serious raiding party.
At least 3 groups of 50+ from what I hear. Haven't been on a VS raid yet so
don't know for sure.

On that note - I'd like to tag along on a VS or CoM raid (just to see how
it's done - I won't be expecting loot) if any folks on Erollisi Marr are
headed that way soon, send me a Tell!
