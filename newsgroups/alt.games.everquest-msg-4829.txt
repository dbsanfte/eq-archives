Hi

I have been playing everquest for a couple of weeks now and I'm thoroughly 
addicted.  Anyway I have a level 7 Barbarian Warrior who wants to take up 
smithing.  I cannot find any ore or sharpening stones in Halas and have 
heard that they may be avalable in Erudin..

So my question is..at lvl 7 is the journey relatively safe or am I likely 
to get killed as soon as I start?

Any advice would be welcome.

Thanks

Ceri
