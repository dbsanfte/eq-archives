You're better off fighting blue con mobs, I beleive.  Why? Because
they will typically have lower AC, which means you will LAND MORE HITS
and have more chances to get skill-ups.

Other things can affect weapon skill ups are DEXTERITY, and DELAY of
weapon.  So, try to get a good amount of DEX, fast weapon(s) and / or
HASTE.
