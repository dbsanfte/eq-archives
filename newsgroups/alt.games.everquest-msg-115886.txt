Umm.... I said  UPgrade not DOWNgrade, Othmir cap has no graphic either.

Heh, Ensnare doesn't last long enough at times for me, I doubt that plain
old Snare is going to be very useful, though Scale of Wolf is kind of fun to
use at times, OMG WEEEEEEEEEEEE, I'm FAST.

Edged out?  I'd call it a major upgrade, unless the +meditate mod actually
does something for mana regen, though yeah, more wis does make it good for
tradeskilling.  I blew 500pp getting my jewelcraft up to 71, maxxed wis with
my bank gear at 218, unfortunately I couldn't get cha up above 79.

Why not?  If you're quadding and need the mana, swap in the migraine maker,
for other things go with the sarnak shield, the ac/hp are excellent for when
you get hit occasionally, and the resists speak for themselves, good for
things like soloing casters and raiding.
