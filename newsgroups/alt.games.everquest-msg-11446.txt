Well, that's your problem right there: Acer.  Acer isn't
exactly known for making the best computer equipment.  Kinda
like the Yugo of PC's...

Don't mean to sound like I'm flaming, cuz I'm not, I just want
to point-out that Acer made some very serious trash computers
for a long time and I'd suspect that their drivers and such
are of the same quality level.  You do get what you pay for...
