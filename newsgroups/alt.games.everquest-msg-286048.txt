Thanks, murdocj - where the hell he gets his ideas on "what people
mean" baffles me.  I thought my post favoured neither one game or the
other, too  :D 

Just as a check, I went back 20 days on both groups and (allowing for
various filters I have set up) AGE had 53 posts and WoW had 3,263, so
it's unlikely that people are moving en masse away from Usenet.
