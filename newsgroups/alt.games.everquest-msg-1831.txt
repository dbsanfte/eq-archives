This calls to mind the uproar attempts made by certain religious
factions back in the 80s regarding D&D. They were trying to say that
the game promoted anti-social behavior, satanism, and all manner of
other 'problems'. Most notable were the few cases where some kid
committed suicide and the 'authorities' blamed it on AD&D.

I followed a few of these cases, and often found that the kids in
question didn't actually play D&D at all, and never had - the
religious zealots were fabricating information to make their case.

In other cases, the kids did indeed play D&D, but had a myriad of
other problems that actually lead to their suicide.

The short and long of it, as Jim Monk seems to be saying, is that EQ
may surface personality problems, but it doesn't cause them - the
problems already existed.
