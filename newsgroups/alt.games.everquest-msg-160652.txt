Yes, this is pretty much how I understand the situation as well.  I oversimplified
things to some extent in my advice, but the results are reasonably valid.  Big
slow weapon without highly annoying procs if you aren't the designated punching
bag, and fast needling weapons that really irritate and keep irritating if you
are.  Damage output is a factor, but its very plain to see that number of hits is
also a factor, so much so that its quite possible for a big slow weapon to do more
damage per minute than the small fast strategy, and still have the faster weapons
keep aggro.  Also, the faster weapons tend to grab that aggro earlier, which is
nice for pulling things off from where they shouldn't be, and slow weapons give
others a lot more chances to get aggro in between swings.
