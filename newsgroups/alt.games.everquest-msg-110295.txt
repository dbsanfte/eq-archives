Well sure, that may be your perspective, but what makes you think that
it might have an validity from my perspective.

Harmony is good.  Perfect is evil.

Well, to be serious for just a moment:  It looked to me (oh no!
perspective again) like John was trying to assert his belief in a
universal concept of good/evil while Lokari was gleefully (well, I
suspect she was gleefull, I could easily be mistaken) demolishing his
examples without ever addressing what he was trying to say.  What I
have tried to point out, is that the variety of ways in which the
words "good" and "evil" might be used does not have anything in
particular to do with whether or not there is a universal concept that
can be referred to by those words.

Damn, still in serious mode...
Please cite for me the evidence that supports your disagreement.

Well, if it is indeed "a point worth discussing", and I agree that it
is, then I don't see how you could avoid getting "some people pretty
worked up" by discussing it.  On the other hand I'm unable to conceive
of this as harmful.  In fact, barring a deliberate incitement to
hatred/murder/mayhem or other equally despicable evils, I have
difficulty seeing any harm at all in the written word, most especially
in an open discussion that occurs in a public forum.
