A skill cap determines your maximum ability in a skill
at a certain level.  For instance, if your meditate
skill is "(level * 5) + 5" and you're level 20, your
meditate skill can NOT exceed 105 regardless of how
long you meditate until you level to 21.

Alchemy is level-capped as well, meaning that you are
unable to exceed the cap (formula above is correct) at
a certain level.  So, if you're level 25, your maximum
skill would be 5, for instance, and 10 at level 26.

SoW potions trivial at skill 37.  Assuming you didn't
train your maximum skill points, you should see skill
increases from the time your started up until your
skill reaches 37, but no more than 5 per level starting
at level 24.
