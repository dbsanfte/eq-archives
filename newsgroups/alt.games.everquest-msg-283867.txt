If implying that all necros are good for is pumping mana
into other casters is not an insult to the necro class in
general, I don't know what is.

The tone of most of your posts have been insulting, but
I suppose that's to be expected on usenet. Hard to find
a good discussion hereabouts.

Certainly the tone of the original post and those
following suggest you came to vent.  Personally, I
don't see anything wrong with that; however, when
someone corrects your misconceptions about necros,
insulting them is probably not the best course of
action particularly if you wish to later claim you came
to learn.

Ironic that the very attitude you accuse Palindrome of
having is the same one you come across as possessing.

You can claim no expertise in any class but your own,
yet you're quite confident that you know the way the
game was intended to be played?  I suppose that makes
you an expert on Everquest in general?  This from a
person with a level 59 character who was unaware of
how to instantly interrupt a spell?  Heheh.  Your posts
are most amusing.  ;)

Make what most effective?  The table?  The game?
The class?  It's arguable that Necros are most effective
at soloing.


> With a chip on your shoulder and going it alone...
> you are really missing out

I'd say it's quite possible to go it alone and not miss
out.  Just as possible as not going it alone and still
missing out is, at any rate.  Although, I don't think
anyone was suggesting that they go it alone every
hour of every day, rather that necros are quite
self-sufficent, and probably require the least
intervention from other players than any other class
in the game, both in and out of groups.

And there is the fact that what one person may
consider 'missing out' another may not.  Not good
to assume your own personal opinion is held by
everyone.

Perhaps you don't realize that accusing someone of
being insulting and then insulting them in the next
breath reeks of hypocrisy?  Particularly after a long
string of posts with the tone in which you've imbued
'em.

Perhaps next time the druid wants to heal, instead of
being an unproductive member of the group, you can
nuke and stun?  That's the way it should be when the
end-all and be-all of the game is to be a productive
member of the group, shouldn't it?  Certainly it would
be more productive than whining here.

Would've been working on bash, myself.  ;)
