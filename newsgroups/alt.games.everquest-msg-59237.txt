No, if the death was due to a mob or self nuke, you get exp for the
first rez (duel deaths don't give back exp ever--if it does, it's an
exploit).   You just don't get exp from the subsequent rezzes, just a
free ride back to your corpse.

That "free ride" is why Verant a LONG time ago, put a rez timer on
corpses.

Before people were leaving corpses in places like PoA so that they can
just get rezzed back up rather than go through the stupid island
hopping time sink.

They are.
All no drop keys are soul bound with the sole exception of Sleeper's
Tomb key.  VI's excuse is "it adds more risk to the zone".  WHAT
FUCKING RISK?!?

Aside for Ventani (who is a one time kill and no longer on our
server), the entire zone can be cleared with 3 solid groups--to be
safe against Prog, bring four groups.
