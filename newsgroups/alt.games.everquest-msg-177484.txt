I agree with the other posters, but I would add another (admittedly more
expensive) option. If you can find a copy of EQ Gold for the $40 or so that
I've seen it offered around here, with that purchase you will have access to
EVERY expansion currently available. This includes both Luclin (a $30 value)
and PoP (another $30 value), and also throws in Velious. The other
not-often-enough-mentioned value is that the five-CD set that comes in this
box has a LOT of the most recent patches included on it so that you'll have
a LOT less patch downloading to do compared to what you're going to have to
download if you install only Luclin, for example. Worthwhile option, if you
can afford it.
