Is this a known problem? Or something relatively new? It seems that most
of the Hill Giants I track in EK now are under the ground. I track to a
spot and no giant.

Once I tried casting Earthquake, after being told that the spell has a
pretty good vertical range, over the spot where track said the giant
was. The giant aggro'ed on me and started to hit me, but never appeared.
He was automatically targeted when he attacked, so I was able to kill
him with spells without ever seeing him. Felt kinda like a submarine
battle having to use track to stay near him =). Got the exp, but
couldn't loot.

Is there anyway to get these guys to pop out of the ground? I was going
to try running to the bridge to see if he would pop out there, but I
figured he'd just keep hitting me from under the water and the bridge.
Would have been hard to explain an "invisible" train to NK as well.
