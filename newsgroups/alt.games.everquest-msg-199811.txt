I used to pay a lot for it when I was a fledgling chanter who couldnt
get a group because all the morons already had KEI so saw no need for
Haste, Crowd Control, Buffs etc.

I also at the time defended the high cost of KEI because it costs like
20k to buy the spell, you have to have attained 60th level to use
it....unlike a 29th druid port which costs around 18pp and which
people donate 20pp for the port. They also donate 20pp for KEI which
seemed unfair to me.

....that is until I play my druid again and have to go out of my way
to group with someone, port them to destination along with the loading
times of the zones and then getting back to where i was. An enchanter
just sits there and gets 5 people handing in cash one after another.

yeah....20pp is a fair price.
