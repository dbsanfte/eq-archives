Let me also add that this is the "attitude" of some non-pvp players.
BTW, it works really well? I have no idea _what_ you are talking
about? How doesn't it work? Do you play on a pvp server?
How long have you played on a pvp server? Why are they making
a new pvp server if it is "unworkable in practice".

This is what I _love_ about pvp servers. They sift out the wusses
and keep the real players.
