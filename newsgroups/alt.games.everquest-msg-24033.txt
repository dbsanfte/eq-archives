In the end game, you're mostly fighting one ubermob at a time, or at
least that is the aim (/grin).

Warriors: Tanking - highest hps, high AC and damage mitigating
disciplines make them the only choice for L65-75 ubermobs

Rangers: Great damage, can't tank for sausages. True-shot turns them
into a chain-nuking infinite-mana wizard for a short period

Rogues: The best DoT there is, and their agro-management tools mean they
can usually live most of the fight when played well

Monks: Screwed. Great damage, but no way to avoid the agro that damage
generates. This = dead monk, or sit-there-FD-the-rest-of-the-fight monk

(Disclaimer: The above is relating to the high level (L60) game only.
This is only accounting for 4 classes, because that was all that was
asked for. The monk comments aren't an insult to monks, rather support
for them to get some much needed enhancements)
