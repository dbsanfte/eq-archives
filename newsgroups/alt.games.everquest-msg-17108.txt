Her bringing down hell on herself and you was her sin. Gating out was only a
sin because she brought the fun to you.

If she had been following protocol, and things got nasty, gating is her option.
If she leaves too early, then you get to decide if you wish to group with her
again, but she does nothing "wrong" by leaving earlier than you would have
preferred.

However, as I stated, she is not a team player so dump any interaction with her
in the future--or at least don't gripe when she does it again.

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
