Ok, so some of us are way behind in the AA ranks. Total now at 87.
I only started game 2 years ago, and have yet to be pwr lvld, or earn AAs by 
going AFK and let someone earn me a bag full of AAs by "soloing" MM.

That said, I have just spent 9 AAs on MGB, and in order to stop me appearing 
like a lemon in game, I have a few questions to ask.

Basically, How??

I have a "hot-key" MGB button now, so the general question being.
Do I "pop" the MGB hotkey prior to casting my group spell?

Do I cast the group spell first, and "pop" the MGB key during its cast time?

If the former, how long after popping the MGB Hotkey have I got before 
casting the grp spell?

Should I target myelf or a close player and cast?

Any other info?
Thanks in advance.
