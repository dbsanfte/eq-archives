    Nonsense. The planes actually have thresholds well above what non-planar
areas have. If you want to tank in PoV, say, you have to have a good AC and
good HPs or you will be pounded to dust faster than a cleric can save you.
I've seen shamans try to go to PoV/PoS that were level 55 with 1400 HPs
unbuffed, and get one-rounded after slow landed. They can't play there. They
CAN play in Umbral Plains, though, and many other zones in the game. The
conclusion: PoV/PoS is harder.

    You keep confusing "risk" with "reward" because of your backwards
philosophy that there is no more risk in EQ and that only reward can be
measured. Ask that level 55 shaman if there's risk in EQ, you might be
surprised at his answer.

    As you told another poster: "You ain't there, you don't know." We NEED
those AA points to survive against what we fight. We aren't gonna give up on
them because they come slower. And getting them in a place that poses almost
no risk, where the loot is actually good, and where we can pull rediculous
trains and laugh as we decimate them, sounds like a lot of fun.
