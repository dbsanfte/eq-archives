Not just economically sometimes.....
In this past year's week-of-Halloween events, in East Karana, my cleric was
never able to get one of those really nice wisdom caster belts that were
dropping.....why?  (besides the fact that I never killed a mob that dropped
one?)....

Because whenever someone would call out the location of one, the druids with
SoW on always beat me to it......

(The lag and my getting lost in the zone were also factors, but I wanna
blame druids for something......hehe...)
