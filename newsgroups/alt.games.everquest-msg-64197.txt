Kunark was an absolute disaster, all the stock got held back when the
suppliers lost ALL the customer orders, as I recall. No-one knew who to
contact, different suppliers in the States and Europe all blaming each other
or Verant, and Verant blaming the suppliers of course.  I think it was
eventually established that Verant's advance order base had been deleted by
mistake, hence the premature end of its online store. I ended up getting a
refund of all shipping charges plus one or more month's subscription
rebates, I think in the end they more or less paid me to take the darned
thing off their hands :)!
