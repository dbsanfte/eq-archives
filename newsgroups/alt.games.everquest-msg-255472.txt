Not sure where you get this - most raids I've been on last about 4-5 hours.
I was part of a guild that raided on EST - they started at 4pm my time and
I was always done around 9.

Yep -the usual generalization about raiders here.

well - I raided 3 times a week for around 4-5 hours each.  My last review 
was Wed - The categories were evenly split between exceeds expectations 
and excellent (the highest rating).  My girlfriend of 15 years and I
spend a lot of time together.  I am a hobbyist cook (about 3 times a 
week I make something a bit out of the ordinary)

Yep - your profiling seems to be right on the mark.

Time put in is the only thing to differentiate players.  Whether you put 
it in 40 hours a week and get there faster, or 20 hours a week and take
twice as long -- you still put in the time to get to a goal.  The only
way around it is working outside the game mechanics and spending RL dollars
to skip ahead.
