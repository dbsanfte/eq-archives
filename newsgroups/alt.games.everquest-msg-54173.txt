Last night was the first time in a LONG time that I saw significant
number of people being booted.  I thougt it was just my server (since
when I logged on we appreared to be less crowded than the PVP servers)
but guildmates mentioned that dormmates on other servers were having
similar problems.  Oddly enough I didn't see anything out of whack on
BGP flap-stats or traceroutes.

Ummmm, get thee to KC, get three more levels, and head to Seb?  Hell,
you're a gnome, you're supposed to die anyway, might as well go now.
