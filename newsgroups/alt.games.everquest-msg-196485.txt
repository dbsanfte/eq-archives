I get my acrylia hunting Grol baku soldiers in Tenebrous mountains, the
grimling there drop it too but the grol baku soldiers (only soldiers and the

killing grol baku soldiers will give bad faction with all the "aliens" in
tenebrous, but as i read somewhere " its not like they know where you are
living" ;-)
