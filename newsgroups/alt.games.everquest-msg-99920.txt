No, the only pure resist buffs that stack with Summer is bard songs and
Seasons, but Seasons only stacks from a bug, and doesn't always work.  Mage
and Wizard DS spells have fire resist on them that stacks with Winter, and I
think some classes get resist self buffs that also stack with most things.
