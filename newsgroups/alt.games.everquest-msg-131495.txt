Max Powers, and jon the starter of this rant thread are just mad. Cause they
didnt get uber twink from those high lvl gear giving players. they begged
for pp, items, plvling, and other stuff...and the uber player told them to
f$#% off! but they still pestered them. so they ported them right into a
high level area with wizzy spires or druid rings..

  Maybe you should go back to boring old UO and live in care bear land
(tramell). and bake cookies with your lame arse guild-trying to save brit
from lord blackthorne.  Dont say EQ sucks, cause it doesn't.  It's a fun and
enjoyable game with all lot of friendly people.  There is no False
Advertisement on the EQ box, there is a 30 trial period. I had it before
they took out case after the 30 days.
