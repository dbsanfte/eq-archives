Once again Ill ask, what statute is being violated by the actions you 
outline ? Dont give me the free speech argument. There is no such thing on a 
moderated privately run board.

Once again Sony is free to allow or disallow ANYONE they want from partaking 
of thier product. I could be banned tomorrow for no breach of the EULA and I 
Would have ZERO legal recourse.

Their right exsists regardless of what is / isnt posted.  We play because 
SOE LETS us play. Granted its in thier best interests to let us play, but by 
NO means do we have any right to play.
