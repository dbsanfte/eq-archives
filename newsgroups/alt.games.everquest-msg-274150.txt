But the fact you're willing to violate the EULA *proves* you're not
honest. It's kind of hard to argue that you're an honest person when
you're in the business of fencing stolen goods.

"Hey, bud! Check out these watches I stole! They're genuine Rolex!"
"Uhm....how do I know they're not just cheap copies?"
"Because I'm so honest!"
