Well, yeah, but they re-spawned at their bind points, like everybody, no? 
You gotta let go of the hate, man. :P

???????

Bizbee's point is not what *YOU* get out of killing the Dragoon, it's 
that by killing Gix you are causing the Dragoon to spawn, which then 
proceeds to harass people porting in to the Wizard pyramid. You *are* 
taking care of the Dragoons you spawn, aren't you?

Oh yes. He adds a sense of danger to the WC wizard port. Enough with 
Druids being the only ones with faction issues at their landing pads.
