My halfling druid is currently working the Oasis. At 15th level, it takes pretty
much all of her mana to solo many of the mobs (but consistenly finds two and
sometimes *four* silks on a spider. Wow.) Run back to the dock where there always
seems to be a crowd and fish while medding. I can either sell the fish to the
gypsies or (did this twice already) sell it to people in the zone who are on long
camps and running short on food (being able to forage water to sell is very nice,
too, and desert madmen almost always carry water.) Master fisherman, master
spellcaster and master zen... nice combo.
