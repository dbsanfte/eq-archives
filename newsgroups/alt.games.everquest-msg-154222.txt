It is entirely true that a group of weezards could easily kill a dragon with
32k hps. However they are failing to mention several points. The wizards in
question are all 60 with multiple aa points .

Point 2  is that a group of NON wizards can do exactly the same thing. A
group of 6 can kill talendor for instance . It just requires lvl 60s with
multiple aa points.

On the other hand the wizard class is most often played by somewhat arrogant
obnoxious people ( I like them anyway though) . They tend to brag and are
getting the nerf they seem to be begging for :( similiar to whats happening
to monks atm or what happened to druids long ago.
