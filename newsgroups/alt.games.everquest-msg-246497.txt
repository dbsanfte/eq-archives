Because I am disappointed I feel the need to go somewhere else.
I am disappointed because they are doing this all to hold a carrot to
keep people from leaving EQ.
I am disappointed because EPICS should of been fixed / augmented
without buying X expansion.  They have been broken for quite some
time.
I am disappointed because they are pushing another expansion out the
chute, and they still have numerous issues to fix in the present game.
