That is bad luck - it certainly can be a bummer when you're hyped to
try a new game and discover that you can't play it yet. Imagine how
frustrated the folks were when the game was first released - the first
two weeks were almost constant down-time!

>my Barbarian Shaman spent bloody hours stumbling around 
>in the dark

Barbarians have the unfortunate quality of being more or less night
blind, and Halas has never struck me as well lit even during the day.
There are ways (later, as your character becomes more powerful) to get
around the night blindness, but that doesn't help you right now.

You might want to adjust your in-game (and possibly out-of-game) gamma
settings - the default values were too dark for my taste as well, even
with a non-nightblind character.

>trying to find Margyn at the Church of the Tribunal

For getting around in your home town, I strongly suggest you print
some maps. Go to www.eqatlas.com, which is an excellent map site. Now,
personally, I only recommend this for towns (since Verant gives you
maps, albeit really crummy ones, for them in the book anyway). I would
strongly encourage you to *not* use maps in your first forays into
wild areas. The tension is much better and more enjoyable when you're
actually exploring.

That I can't offer much help on - please post your system specs (CPU,
RAM, video card, etc) and your connection type (dial-up, cable, etc),
and maybe someone here will have some suggestions.

A rule of thumb is that when there's a patch, there's an emergency
patch sometime after that to correct whatever the patch screwed up :)
Frustrating as hell, yes, but good for the game in the long run. And
the congestion on chat it unfortunately typical when the game servers
are down. Personally, when they're down, I'd recommend just going and
finding something else to do for several hours. If you sit around
waiting for the servers to come back up you're just going to get
irritated.

Count your blessings. The addiction is fierce once it hits!
