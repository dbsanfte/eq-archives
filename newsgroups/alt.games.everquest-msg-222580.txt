I always preferred Upper Guk, the spider area off to the right when
you zone in and then the bridges. You should be able to keep both
cleared easily. 

>I) something else

Shadeweaver's thicket, the shades around the Paludal tunnel entrance.
Might possibly the the best spot for a true newbie to get decent plat.


The villages in Gunthak if you can handle it, but I think you might be
a bit low. Decent plat, the occasional Gem, and I've gotten a couple
of items that sold for around 400p. 

Tenebrious mountains, the caves for acrylia drops. Or hunt the zone
line to GF and grab the grimling messenger every 90 minutes. It's lore
but you can store up 3 if you plan ahead. Make one pack, turn one in
for the pattern and keep the last one till you sell a pack. Might not
be all that worthwhile these days but back when they sold for 2k my
ranger could get one for about 2 hours worth of work and get decent
exp while hunting and waiting for him to run past. 

Rgds, Frank
