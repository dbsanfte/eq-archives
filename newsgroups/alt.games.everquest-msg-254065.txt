I vaguely suspect you misunderstood their reason.  The short cast time on 
darkness line has nothing to do, really, with slowing down pulls.  But if 
you pull with snare, it's going to take twice as long to get the mob back 
to camp.  It doesn't take a very long pull before that can -really- slow 
down pulls.  Besides, with the duration on most darkness snares, if you 
pull with snare, it will wear off long before you need it, when the mob 
decides running away would be fun, so you end up having to cast it twice.

If they knew they weren't the best tank, but they were the best option for 
a puller, deliberately swapping aggro when you get back to camp is a 
realistic choice. *shrug*
