Ok I tried not to get side tracked with AA's and I decided to take the
ole Necro to 60.  Managed only 2 AA's in the run but at least I made
it.  Now what I was thinking its time to get some of those cool AA
skills that everyone else seems to be sporting.

Looking for some guidance on where to go at 60 to get AA's.  Any help
would be great.  Don't get to group as often as I like so solo would
be best.

Not part of a big guild, and mostly accustomed to CRAWLING through
each level, I have what most would consider mid-level gear.  I still
like the look of the Flayed Skin Armor.  Got most of the spells to 60
except for the heavy hitters at 60 (bummer).  Did manage to grab a
couple nice pieces / stuff to get my CHA down to 13 which I am quite
proud of.
