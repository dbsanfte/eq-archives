Your right, this is a tangent. I shouldn't have allowed you to lead me 
down it. When you said they were profit driven, I should have just said 
"So what?"

Actually I gave them permission to make one withdrawal of 12.95 per 
month. *ONE* withdrawl of *12.95*.

Then they unilaterally decided that 12.95 wasn't enough and upped it 
14.95, and assumed that because I hadn't cancelled that I'd agreed. This 
is already annoying. And in some jurisdictions is even illegal. I'd have 
preferred it if they had to seek explicit authorization for the increase 
to protect individuals who did not receive their notification ... 
perhaps due to being away on vacation. I'd wager theres dozens of 
players who missed the price increase notifications.

Then they forget to follow through for a month.

Then they unilaterally decide that they can authorize themselves to 
retroactively bill us, and help themselves to the balance 'owed' with a 
second *unauthorized* transaction. And this one is even less publicized 
than the previous one. A LOT of people have SOE email directed to 
spam/junk/trash folders automatically... if they're still at the same 
address at all.

The two *taken together* are pretty damning for SOE. 

IE It would be quite different if I'd authorized them to take 14.95, and 
they'd been doing so for several months, and suddenly due to a hiccup 
they took 12.95. I wouldn't have the least dispute over the 2.00 or over 
them REVERSING the bill and re-billing at the agreed upon amount.

But as it stands I'm not even convinced that their "notification" 
constitutes a legal price increase now. Legally actions speak louder 
than words... if you say your going to increase rates, and you bill me 
the same amount for the month, and then actually increase the amount the 
following month then its reasonable to beleive that the rates hadn't 
gone up yet, and that the error was in the date. They had, in effect 
reserved the right to increase rates on such and such a date, but in 
actual fact didn't do it until the following month. 

I dispute their right to retroactively bill me for a price increase they 
didn't implement on time. I dispute their right to bill me automatically 
with 'special time fees' to collect the funds that are themselves in 
dispute.

Given that they caved instantly when a customer complained about it, I'm 
betting even they aren't as sure I owe them the money, or that they can 
take it in this manner - as you seem to be.

Assuming of course that I received both the initial and subsequent 
notifications of what they had decided to do with my credit card.
