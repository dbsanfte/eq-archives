Subject: Haven't played in a while, what's KEI and C3?

Had a response to an earlier post of mine that suggested I get KEI and another
that said I should get C3 but I have no idea what either of these are.  I don't
have Luclin yet as I need to upgrade my RAM before I even try to run it so I'm
guessing that maybe they're terms from Luclin?
