Heh. Hey, compared to the "support" I've had with some smaller ISPs (and 
maybe I've just had bad luck), Verizon's has been exemplary. Moreover, it's 
really comforting to know that my ISP is resourced sufficiently to be able 
to take my calls 24/7. I can't tell you how disappointing it was to call 
this cable company last night at 7:30pm and receive their "call back during 
business hours" message. Bad sign already.

>> Honestly, though, I haven't needed much support

True, neither have I. One time I had a recurring dropped connection problem 
that was driving me NUTS. It turned out that they had a bad circuit board at 
the CO, but as soon as they determined this, they were on it and replaced 
it. I was back in business before the evening was up. I don't know how my 
cable company would handle this.

BINGO, you hit on a real sore point there for me and remind me of a story 
confirming your perspective. The one nightmare I had with Verizon was when I 
changed one small thing in my account (I don't even remember what it was 
now). I remember extracting promises from the guy taking the order on the 
phone, that he would carefully put my order through so it wouldn't result in 
a cancellation of my existing service, just the change requested. Of course, 
my connectivity went down and when I called support they said "Yeah, shows 
here that you cancelled your account". Sigh. "Well, turn it back ON". 
"Sorry, we can't do that. You'll have to process a new application. Waiting 
time shouldn't be more than a couple of weeks". Thus began my 2 week 
adventure using dial-up. This is when I discovered that although it sucked 
*unbelievably* for downloads, MMOG'ing with dial-up was virtually 
indistinguishable from broadband. As luck would have it, this occurred just 
as some huge SWG beta patch went live and I experienced firsthand a 12-hour 
dial-up download. Lessons learned.
