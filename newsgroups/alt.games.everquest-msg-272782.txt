What do you mean by meaningful?  I have been in three guilds in EQ1, the 
first one a family and friends guild, no level or time requirements 
whatsoever, no raiding at all.  The second one, similar, but did have a 
very generous minimum level requirement, and did do some raiding (no 
required attendance at all).  The third one is a part time raiding guild, 
if you are online during a scheduled raid, you are raiding.  Requires 
attending a minimum of 4 raids a month to remain active (able to 
participate in getting loot).  We have a fixed raiding schedule, always 
the same days, the same times, so it's easy to plan around, and the 
attendance requirements are not very hard to meet.  We do have plenty of 
minimum requirements per class.

The first and second guilds were great for always having a group handy, 
always knowing I'd find some friends online to play with.

Lol, well, I do understand that, I have much the same feelings about it.

Given your time constraints, sounds to me like a casual guild would be 
perfect for you, like the first two I used to be in.
