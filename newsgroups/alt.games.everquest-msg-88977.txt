RoF style is named after the 'Ring Of Fire' cycle in Acrylia. 

It used to be that to kill an ubermob, you used a single Main Tank to
absorb all the damage from a mob. If only one person is getting hit, all
the healers focused on keeping that person healed, while everyone else
was free to do the damage. VI didn't like this because the players got
so good at it, they were killing mobs with fewer and fewer people,
trivialising the encounter. 

So, they devised encounters to combat that strategy in Luclin, Ring Of
Fire being the most well known. It basically involves having multiple
mobs in camp at the same time, so you can't just concentrate on healing
one person with everything you've got. You have to keep several mobs
occupied at one time. Do you kill them as fast as possible, leaving the
boss mob alone to be tanked? Do you kill the boss mob as fast as
possible, and hope you've allocated enough people to crowd control to
keep the mob occupied for the duration (usually 15mins or more for
luclin ubermobs) Do you put your best tank on the main mob, making it
safer, or on one of the adds, so fewer healers are tied up on adds? 

It's a whole new way of fighting, and it's people who've CH-cycled a MT
their whole raiding lives, are having more than a few problems. 90
people and a 12 cleric chain,  wiping multiple times Aary in nToV over 5
hours on Zeb last night because of the changes to link unsplitable mobs
into the fight. Then another, more adaptable guild comes in and clears
half the zone without wiping (neither of the above were my guild)

Basically, RoF is a catchall term for:
Fighting an ubermob at the same time as several other tough mobs that
need to be neutralised in some way.

If you fire off and AE taunt in that situation, you'll have several
major-damage-dealing mobs on you at once, more than any tank can handle.
