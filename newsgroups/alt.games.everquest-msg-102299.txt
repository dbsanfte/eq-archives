. If you are level 24, and you group up with a 22 and

I thought there was a bonus to the xp the group got as a whole when you 
killed a mob.  Like if I solo a mob I get X experience.  If I group, 
with someone of same lvl, I get 55% of X or something like that.  I 
forget the exact numbers, something like 5% more for each person in the 
group.  Gave additional incentive to group with people.  Your numbers 
add up to 100, making it a fair split, but not with the bonus.

	And yes, grouping is much better, I always feel useless as a cleric cause 
I never do damage and, well, the Nybright sisters loved to hit on me 
when I was there, making my group give up their current target to save 
my little dwarf hide, but you kill things faster with less downtime and 
less risk, so by far it's better.
