There's a guy who has been trying to track this stuff for quite a
while.  I believe his site is http://www.mmogchart.com/.  He tracks
press releases, news articles, etc and tries to interpolate the
numbers.  Obviously not an exact science, but I think his numbers are
considered to be the best available.

The WoW number may be complete BS... but given the supporting data
(number of servers running, percolation of WoW into popular culture,
etc) I can believe it.  After all, EQ certainly had numbers in the
hundreds of thousands, and WoW certainly is wildly more successful
than EQ, so why are numbers in the millions unbelievable?

(yeah yeah yeah... you still don't believe it... that's cool, I'm just
pointing out why I believe 6.5 - 7 million).
