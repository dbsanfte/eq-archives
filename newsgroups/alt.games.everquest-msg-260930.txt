Yet another thing to make me glad I play with the speakers off.

I went to the EQ directory and played them while waiting on the servers
yesterday, just for shits and giggles.  Some of them were cute (I got a
chuckle out of the Gnomish battlecry of "ATTACK!  You go first ....."), but
I can see how griefers could really use and abuse this little gem.

I'm glad you got enjoyment out of it.  It served it's purpose, then.  I'd be
interested to know if you still have it turned on in six months, though.

And btw .... been playing since March 2001 and my highest character is 62.
It's not about the destination as far as I'm concerned.  Just because
someone has a differing opinion from yours doesn't mean that you have to be
an ass.
