This is the one I use... It's a heavily modified version of the "Sars" 
skin from eqinterface.com, to make it even lighter and more unintrusive. 
If I could run EQ at a higher resolution, then perhaps I would try to 
run one of the more flash fantasy-themed ones, but as it is, this is 
serving me well.

I'm still not totally pleased with it... I go in and mess with it 
regularly. =)
