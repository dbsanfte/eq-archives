Because I'm not an expert on focus effects.  Affliction Efficiency saves
more mana than MP, and is used instead if you have both on?

What else am I overlooking?  A CBB is very much within slush fund budget,
particularly since I can probably resell whichever of the bracers I'm
wearing now I end up dumping.

I think I really need to look into spell haste II, or perhaps affliction
haste II, the fine art of channeling DOTs and Slow on mobs that are beating
on me would really benefit from some speeding up.
