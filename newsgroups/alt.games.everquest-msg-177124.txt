Many people have already touched this, so here's the methods of transport
available per expansion:

1) Basic EQ = Boats and Teleports (Druid and Wizard spells)
2) Kunark + Velious =  added some Rings and Spires
3) Luclin = added wizard teleport spires all joining in the nexus.
4) Planes of Power = added books joining in Plane of Knowledge that connect
to most cities instantly.

    Boats:
    a) boat from Antonica (Qeynos) to Odus (Erudite)
    b) boat from Antonica (Freeport) to Feydewar (Butcher Block)
    c) boat from Antonica (North Nro) to Velious (Ice Clad Ocean)
    d) boat from Anitonica (Oasis of Marr) to Kunark (The Overthere)
    e) boat from Feydewar (Butcher Block) to Kunark (Firiona Vie)

    Rings and Spires:
    (all over the place!)

    Books:
    (all starting cities, or close to them)

Check www.eqatlas.com for more specific zone connection maps.

Good luck and have fun exploring!
