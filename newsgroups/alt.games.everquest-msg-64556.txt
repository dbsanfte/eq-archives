Not sure if anyone else is having this problem, but the text that appears in
the box at the bottom of the screen doesn't seem to wrap properly, and
spills out so that some of it is covering the buttons on the right side of
the screen, making both the text and the buttons unreadable.  Happens in
both full screen (transparent interface) and full-interface mode, and in
both 800x600 and 640x480 video modes.

Is there a fix?  a .ini file entry I could make?  Anything?

The video card is a nVIDIA TNT2, with the latest Detonator drivers from
nVIDIA, and DirectX 8.1

Thanks.
