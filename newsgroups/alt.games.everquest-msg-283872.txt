In fact, he's right.  Instead of saying he's wrong, perhaps you
can provide some reproducable experiments that indicate he
is wrong.

I've spent 7 years playing various casters, and it is my experience
that you never lose mana unless you actually cast the spell or fizzle.
Interrupts have never cost you mana.  In fact, there are even two
special cases where casting a spell will cost you no mana:  casting
a spell before a rez but finishing the cast after (obviously it uses no
mana, because you have no mana) and finishing a cast on a targeted
spell when your target has died.
