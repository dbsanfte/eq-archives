Right off the top of my head; it may eliminate Jeweled Skull quest from
being practical to complete. Problem is you have Gnoll Assasin in the
Karanas at about level 15 who drops the Skull/container and a level 30ish
mob, troll outside Guk and a Splitpaw, who drops the Ruby Eyes.

Right off the back of my head, it may be time for me to quit EQ for the 3rd
time since the game was released. Specifically in another post I mentioned
about the Trueshot Bow quest. The quest involves killing runaway clockworks
for their micro servos which are no drop. I am sure there are dozens of
other quests that will be eliminated from the game like that if the new loot
ing rules are applied as outlined.
