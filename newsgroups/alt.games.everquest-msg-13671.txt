I think I agree with you on the territorial predictions, James.
The neutrals and goods in Erudin, Halas, and Qeynos will have to have to
work under a cease-fire to survive.  Too bad you cannot tell who is on which
team by the con.

The only places the Neutrals will have as a clear haven are Rivervale and
Kaladim.  The only places the Goods will have as a clear haven is the
Felwithe and Kelethin.  The Evil team will have Grobb, Cabilis, Paineel, and
Oggok clearly as theirs.  Neriak might have a few Neutrals, but they'd
better look for a new home before level 6.... (I can just see exiled Dark
Elves trying to make their homes in Rivervale....).

I did see quite a fair percentage of Goods in Qeynos when I logged on there,
but life for them will be very difficult in the long term, and as I said,
they and the Neutrals will probably have to find some way to work together,
or migrate.....
