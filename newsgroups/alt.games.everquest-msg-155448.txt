Nah, look at the names he's remembering - some are focus effects -
items that make your spells cast farther, or quicker, or with less
mana, and so on.  Some are actual spells in the item itself.  When the
item 'procs', it releases that spell on the target.  Some items you
right-click to make it work, some items it's just a random effect from
using it.  Some items have limits on how many times you can use it
before it's 'empty', some are unlimited.
