ok your weapons will hit on primary hand as per its delay, and everytime
your secondary delay is up you make a skill check on duel wield to see if
you can attack with offhand.
each weapon attacks when its reached its delay.
I'm not sure if a second skill check for weapon type is made, but think it
does do it because i have maxed out 1hs and i hit more with 2x 1hs weapons
than i would say a 1hs in primary and a 1hb in secondary.
