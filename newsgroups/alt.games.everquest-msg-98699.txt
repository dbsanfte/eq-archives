I load up the EQ...
Patcher runs.
Game loads, I log in.
I select my server.
I get to the character selection screen.
I choose my character, and click on Enter World.

... and then nothing ...

it sits for a LONG time, and then says "THE SERVER HAS STOPPED RESPONDING."

Yes, I am behind a router. Port forwarding doesn't work (1024-7000),
besides, my friend is behind the same router (Netgear RT314), and he can
play fine. (This has been suggested)

Newest drivers for my hardware (VIA motherboard + 4 in 1s), GeForce2MX
(27.50). Sound, etc, etc (this has been suggested).

With sound disabled, still no go. (Again, suggested).

And finally, all INI/OPT, etc files removed. Basically a fresh install of
EQ. Deleted zone files for where I was at, etc... Still times out while
trying to get in. (This has been suggested).


Any other suggestions?


Windows XP Pro (all current updates)
GeForce 2 MX 200 (27.50)
VIA onboard sound (newest drivers)
DFI CA64-TC motherboard, Via chipset, with newest 4in1s.
Celeron 1GHz
768 Megs RAM
40 Gig HD

Everything seemed to be working until the beginning of March I think.. :/
