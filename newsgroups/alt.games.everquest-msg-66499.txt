Let me get this right.
You pick RDRAM as a sample to illustrate the expense of upgrading to
Luclin.  

Can you tell me what idiot actually went a bought a motherboard based
on the i850 chipset (of which it's hard as fuck to even FIND one) and
is now pissing and moaning about the "higher cost" of RDRAM?

Because you see, boards based on the Intel i850 chipset aren't cheap.
Infact, they usually cost about 40 to 50% MORE than boards based on
say the i845 or even the KT266A chipsets.

The VAST majority of people who have game systems will not have RDRAM
systems.  Infact, only very recently do people even have DDR based
systems--and they typically already have more than enough memory to
handle EQ.
