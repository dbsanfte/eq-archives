In what way?  Dying costs more raw exp in a penalty level AND it takes
a bigger percentage of your exp bar.  So, yes, it is more painful.

This is exactly what I said.  Assuming that you are a human druid,
that the numbers in the link I posted are relatively close, and that
the death penalty is 10% of the experience required for the previous
level, lets look at the numbers.  Dying in level 45 costs you about
738,000 exp, which is about 4.3% of the exp required to get to 46, or
a bit more than a single blue bubble.  Dying in level 46 costs you
about 1,683,000 exp, which is very close to 20% of your level, or one
full yellow bubble.  Dying in level 47 costs you about 870,000 exp,
which is about 10% of the experience required for the level, or 1/2 a
yellow bubble.

Actually, the reason that death in 60 is such a bitch is because 60 is
really a gimp level, it takes less exp to fill up 60 than it takes to
fill up 56.  Were 60 to follow the general exp progression and take
70,000,000 or so exp to fill, a 60 death would be about the same as
any other penalty death.
