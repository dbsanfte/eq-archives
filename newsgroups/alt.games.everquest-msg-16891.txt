get a skinning knife and make the med quality pelts into low quality pets
and then into leather backing .

I would try to sell the hq pelts in eastern wastes, thurgadin , great divide
, east karana , or the commons in that order . High quality pelts are an
excellant way to increase tailoring if you are around the 100 mark in skill
already . The coldain quests have many new people trying to learn tailoring
in a hurry right now so you should be able to get a premium price.
