I'd hope they're still substantially higher than old world zones -
if they widen the blue range up again, I'll be able to solo low 
blues in non-PoP zones nearly non-stop with my 61 air pet.  The 
reason is that the 61+ pets have out of combat regen of 100hp per
tick, and the 61 air pet can solo several level 45-47 mobs in a
row before it needs a heal.  OTOH - trying the same trick on trash
mobs in pop (the dc'able ones) leaves a beat up pet and substantial
mana to recover after each one.  All I want is blues to solo when
I can't find a group (or for small groups without a slower) - a
lower ZEM in those zones is probably called for because the mobs are
easier.
