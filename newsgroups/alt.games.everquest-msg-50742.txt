He spawns at that intersection around 1100 by -200. If you're coming in
from Free Rot, go straight through the first intersection until you come
to the next left you can make. Go left just into HG valley. He wanders
back and forth around that corner. If you see Hastem Boostrutter up
there (the j-boots quest gnome) then Zeph isn't up and you may have to
wait for an hour or so. If you see neither up, take a look for "a drake"
circling up and down that channel you came up to get there. He is, I
believe, also a possible placeholder for the two quest NPCs.
