Disagreed.

This would have been mostly true in the days of old, when to get the gear
and the means to defend one's self or escape, one would have to either be
high enough to hunt LGuk and Sol B for it, or otherwise be very well
connected.

Not so anymore. Resist gear abounds, high levels sell good gear for
reasonable prices(I would have KILLED to have the Bazaar when I was level
10...), and some of them even give it away; and, with all the expansions
out, the game world is SO HUGE that there's no reason for anyone to be
involuntarily tied down by griefers. Oasis? Bah. Go to Shadewaver's or
Paludal, they're empty. Gain 5 levels, get some cash, get some gear, make
some pals, and turn the tables in your favor

From level 1-43 as a Necromancer, from levels 1-25 as a Cleric(A CLERIC!!!)
and levels 1-15 as a Warrior(A WARRIOR!?!?!?!?!), I would speculate that in
probably 2 of every three encounters with PKs, I've managed to either make
it a fair fight, or escaped. Without twinking.

I stand by what I said. It's an ego thing. And that's absolutely, positively
ok and nothing to be ashamed of. We have enough battles like that in the
real world. Most people aren't up to that in an online game.

Fine! But, let's call a spade a spade.;-)
