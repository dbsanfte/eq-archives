Just dusted off my 55 Druid and thought would be fun to
hunt a little in WW.
All started well,was greated with a foraged Dragon egg,
nice, thanks,immediately after zoning in to my joy
after hitting track,I found a Mastodon to  the North,
happily following track I got closer,unseen by the 
hordes of Burrowers thanks to Improved Invisibiliy.
But what is that,tracking message changed to "a
Glacier Mastodon is behind you",behind me?;somehow
I must have overlooked A Mastodon!? :)
I turned around and took some steps,"a Glacier Mastodon
is behind you" - WTF?
I hit track again,2 more Mastodons and a Bronthoterium
on list,ok forget the Mastodons,find the Bronthoterium,I
spare you the Details,you know how this ended.

On closer inspection of the whole zone,every single
mob,who is worth hunting,is below the surface.
Although I must admit there was no shortage on
Ice Burrowers. ;)

This "mob under the surface bug" already lasts way 
too long,I am pretty fed up,City of Heroes sounds more
and more tempting to me ,or maybe I reactivate my UO-
account.

Maybe Sony should  think more about fixing existing
content and zones,before throwing out another expansion,
GoD was the last expansion I bought,if they will not fix
old bugs.
And I dont want to start what I think about the depreciation
of old content by new expansions,I hear there is a 23/29
1hand Ranger weapon rotting in GoD,while I was struggling
to get the Ldon weapons,which are 20/17 and 19/16.Fully
augmented each took 70 level 65 adventures.

Sorry for pointless ranting and misleading subject.
