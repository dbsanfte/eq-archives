Pretty much it's the high level smiths and tailors that make a profit, near
as I can tell--and I mean a profit over total investment, not just per item.
I make a *small* profit off of baking (250) when I care to put in the time,
but only per item, not overall investment.  I made far more towards my
overall investment by selling off spare brownie parts than I ever did
selling anything else.

And that's why most people who TS do it like you do, and like I...  Because
we enjoy it.

It doesn't mean I wouldn't like to make my thousands back, though (or in
other skills, tens or hundreds of thousands).  That's why I have no problem
with high end pieces being priced well over cost.  Sure, it may only cost XX
pp for the parts, but they're the ones that can put it together--not us.
After all, you don't pay a mechanic 39 cents because he fixes a 39 cent
screw, you pay him $30 for knowing which screw, where it is, how far to
tighten it, and having the right tools to reach it deep in the engine.
