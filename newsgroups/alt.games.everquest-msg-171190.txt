}well, there is that little incident where they gunned down the ATF
}agents on live TV..... but oh, that's different....

The first entry I see here relating to gunfire with ATF agents was not 
televised.

---- http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/waco/timeline.html UNDAY,
FEBRUARY 28, 1993:
At about 9:30 a.m. agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
attempt to execute arrest and search warrants against David KORESH and the 
Branch Davidian compound. Gunfire erupts. Four ATF agents are killed and
16 are wounded. An undetermined number of Davidians are killed and 
injured.
----  

It doesn't say who fired first.  Apparently, that's a fact that's never 
been settled.  One agent apparently admitted, but then later recanted, 
that an ATF agent may have shot a dog outside the compound setting this 
off.
