*nix (Linux, Unix, etc) has a utility called "grep". Grep basically takes a 
text file and displays the lines you want or all but the lines you don't 
want. So, with an EQ log I ftp to a box on my LAN, I can use "grep "^You 
say" eqlog.txt" and get an output of lines that start with (thats what ^ 
means) "You say". Likewise, "grep -v " miss"" will get rid of all the miss 
messages (yours and others). Regular expressions are a symbolic way of 
defining patterns to search for, and make grep even more powerful.

Additionally, you can have fun with grep and "wc" (wordcount). "wc -l" 
counts the number of lines, so "grep "^You say" eqlog.txt | wc -l" will 
tell me how many times that character has spoken aloud(the pipe uses the 
previous commands output for input to the second one... in English it's 
like "Find all lines beginning with 'You say' and then count them").

There are many many more powerful ways to do this sort of thing on *nix 
machines, Perl being high on that list, but grep is pretty easy to get 
meaningful data from.
