I won't say it's a common occurance, but it does happen. My level 30 Monk on
the Seventh Hammer was temporarily a Level 10 Warrior a few months back ;)

I was finally able to login with an alt, and catch the other player on,
while the GM was on. It was quickly taken care of. It did take a couple of
days for me  to catch the GM on though :(
