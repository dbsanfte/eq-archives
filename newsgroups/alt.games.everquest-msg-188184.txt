That depends of your definition of good loot. Ive made thousands of
plat selling pelts in the bazaar, stacks at a time. Ive had upwards of
100 of each type at any given time and they went really fast. Id say,
overall , ive made around 10k selling pelts from here (yes, ive spent
ALOT of time camping the poachers). With the very fast respawn, there
can be 2-3 groups constantly pulling from the camp.
