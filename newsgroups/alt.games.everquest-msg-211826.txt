The problem for me is that there seems to be no middle ground ... there's
just distance away from the poles.  I know people who fervently believe that
carbon dating is a trick of the devil, and that the earth is only 5000 or so
years old.  I also know people to whom the term 'biblical archaeology' is an
oxymoron, as they believe that the bible is a work of fiction.

I'm no longer sure what I believe.  My education is in the sciences.
Science doesn't often reconcile well with scripture, and if you throw out
organized religion all you're left with are the various religious texts.  I
do find it interesting, though, that three major religions share stories
from the same book (Genesis) ... the interpretations are just different.

<No flames on this next part, please.  I'm not trolling.  Discussions, yes

To a certain extent, and not meaning to open (yet another) can of worms,
things like evolution are as much faith-based as Christianity.  Wait ...
give me a minute.  There is circumstantial evidence for both, but nothing
hard.  Water into wine?  Multiplying loaves and fishes?  Kind of a reach.
But then again, I can't say that I've ever seen a creature evolve right
before my eyes.  In my years as a microbiologist (before I came to my senses
and started programming for a living), I've seen tons of bacteria mutate at
the subspecies level ... but evolution involves a species change, and never
once did I see Klebsiella pneumoniae become Klebsiella oxytoca.  If it
doesn't happen at the single-cell level, how in the hairy heck is it
supposed to happen with complex multi-cellular organisms?

Some point to the after-effects of evolution as evidence of it's existence,
but that's really no different from having a glass of water and a glass of
wine side-by-side and claiming "I changed the water to wine".

My common sense side says "Of course things evolved from other things ...
can't you see?".  My faith based side says, "When I write code, I tend to
copy a format that works and make minor changes to it to suit my need ...
why wouldn't a god who's busily creating things to the same thing?".

Who knows what the reality is?  I'm back to ... it depends on what you
choose to believe.  And there's no middle ground ... you can't believe both.
I've tried.  For a while I tried, "God set the original pieces in place, and
that set the stage for evolution to happen.".  But the more I thought about
it, I decided that that line of thought was just a cop out.

I'm in the boat with you on statement #1.  I'm about there on statement #2,
but I'm still hopeful that some epiphany will hit me on that subject.
