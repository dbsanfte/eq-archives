Why yes he could but that would be like telling a player to do without armor
or do without a weapon. You do not need any of those either but they sure
make playing the game easier. =)

Jboots quest is not really hard just a lot of competition for the quest
item. Tboots can be bought from the Gnome vendor that sells the tinker bags.
They are the same as Jboots but have a casting time. You can also buy SoW
potions from a Shaman. Some other items have the SoW effect also but allude
me right now and may not be wearable by your race/class.
