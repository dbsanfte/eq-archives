With a mage, you wouldn't have any healing ability, except for the bard's
rather slow heals.

My wife's main is a ranger, and mine is a bard and that has worked pretty
well through to level 60 so far.  Rangers are great at tracking, single
pulling and some limited healing, and they have really good DPS (though
it's more gear dependent than a monk).  I think a druid or shaman would be
a fine partner for a bard also.  And, actually, if you still like your
cleric, that would be great too.
