Nod nod nod!! I had 2 group invites while we dorked around in camp - and one of
them was *my* guildies.  But since I had already commited I hated to back out. 
If I'd realized he was putting together a group of *his* guildies, and that it
was going to be 22 minutes, I may have begged off before they even showed
up....
