FoL, I beleive, you'd have to look elsewhere for. I don't recall if
it's in Oasis with the other shaman "sight" spells, but I'm sure
you'll find it in cleric, paladin, druid, and a few int caster guilds.

As for PoK, most of the spells you didn't find on BST-specific vendors
are probably on shaman vendors, since that the class we get the
majority of our spells from
