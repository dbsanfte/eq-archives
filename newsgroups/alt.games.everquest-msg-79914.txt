EQ is great when you have 2 computers.  I do.  Right now I'm
soloing in LoIO.  It takes me 45-90 seconds to kill something.
Then I go somewhere relatively safe, invis, and med up.  While
I'm medding I can work on projects on the other computer.  Or
perhaps just read email, newsgroups, or browse the web.

Another good way to play is while reading a book.  I've gotten
through a bunch of Robert Jordan books (the Wheel of Time series,
of course) while playing EQ.  The downtime offers ample time to
read.  (My wizard takes at least 3-4 minutes to med up, plenty
of time to read a page or 2.)

Watching TV while playing also works, though you may be pulled
away from the TV unexpectedly.  (Say, if invis goes down early,
and a mob aggros.)  Pre-recording the show with a VCR works
beautifully.  Hit stop.  Dispatch mob.  Hit play and go back to
medding up.

All the EQ downtime is GREAT for "multitasking".  =)
