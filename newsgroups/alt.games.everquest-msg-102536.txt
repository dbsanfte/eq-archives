Ohh, the amount of crap i go through before i ignore someone. My druid
was in a great group in Overthere with a shaman and a few hard working
tanks pulling non stop. Us healer/buffers were constantly at about 20%
mana and tanks were always at half health or less but the xp was
great. I never go role or anon and i get a tell. "Where are you! I
need you to cast SoW on me!" I tell him sorry im in a group and busy
at the moment. "I NEED YOU TO CAST SOW ON ME SO I CAN GO TO LOIO". I
didnt reply. "I WILL PAY 5PP. WHERE ARE YOU!" Im still medding up to
cast another greater heal. "WHERE ARE YOU!!!!! I NEED SOW!" I finally
got mad and had to review my full ignore list to see what name was on
it that i had no idea why it was there. Then i have to /ignore
thatname and then /ignore pesteringlilkid. What bothered my is the
time i spent looking up my ignore list and adding his name was time
not paying attention to the tanks health.

Here is my fix.

Make the damn ignore list unlimited. Just make it like the cat command
in unix where you append info to the end of the file. Make it so that
each time its used it adds another line with a name on it. If they can
make SoL so advanced why not an unlimited ignore list? Shirley it wont
get too big....oh say around a couple hundred lines. Maybe Verant says
"Cant we all just get along?" and limits our abilities to shut
obnoxious lil brats (can you say oasis and loio?) out of our gaming
experience. Maybe since their parents wont teach them manners and
discipline then hopefully some will rub off from group members?
Bah.....make the list unlimited.
