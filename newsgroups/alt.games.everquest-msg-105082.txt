No. The exp is divided between you two. The portion of the
exp that goes to the character who cons the mob as green is
thrown away. Then you receive exp based on the level of the
mob, the zone experience modifier, and hybrid correction
penalties, which cannot exceed (I think) 1/11 of the total
exp required for your current level.

If the level of the lowest character in the group is not at
least 2/3 the level of the highest character in the group
(or higher), the lowest character does not receive exp from
the kill, regardless of what was killed. Members of a party
who meet or exceed the 2/3 limit receive experience. (If a
mob is light blue to one or more of the party members, the
exp awarded to this character is halved.)

Experience for blue+ mobs is divided among a party based on
their level (some say level+5, but I have yet to see
definitive proof). So if a level 60 and a level 40 were
grouped, the level 40 character would receive 40% of the exp
for each kill, and the level 60 would receive 60% of the exp
(or 59.090% and 40.909%, if you believe the +5 theory). This
is the extreme example because this is the most levels that
can separate two characters who both receive exp for a kill.
Again, if any of the kills were green to the 60, that
portion of the exp is allocated out and then thrown away.
