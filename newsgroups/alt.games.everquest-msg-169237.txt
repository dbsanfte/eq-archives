}How many points you have?

1

}What did you spend points on?

Run1 (duh) :)

}What are you planning to get next?

Run3, Regen 3.  Working my way toward dire charm as quickly as possible, 
followed by MGB.  Not sure what to do with the 12 points I'll need to get 
in the middle bit, but will probably divide them among SCM, MC, and that 
durability thing.

}Do you wish you hadnt bought certain abilitys?

Well... not yet. :)
