I liked the effect of the scale when living in Freeport.  The city felt
very imposing, as it should.  QEynos...well, I just betrayed last night,
so I still don't know what it's like around town.

Actually, I find that the scale in the bedroom communities isn't large at
all..it's just about normal compared to RL.

Admittedly, EQ-L scale always felt off to me...like I was walking in a toy
town. But one gets used to it eventually. :)

Seeing Qeynos rising up over the hills in the distance is really very
inspiring, whereas in EQ-L it was more just of an "ahh, good to be home!"
sort of feeling.
