Enchanters have haste buff.  The message is something about moving faster I
think.  Other than that not much that I can think of.  As I said, people
have asked my Dark Elf Magician for SoW, with or without the pet nearby. 
And the one guy was trying to beg a Clarity from my elemental pet, and got
really pissed when it ignored him.  (Situations like that *really* make me
wish that Magicians got Voice Graft.)
