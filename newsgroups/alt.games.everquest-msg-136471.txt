Didn't he say there was a guy sitting there?  I'd have (a) see invised 
myself, and (b) asked anyone who was there or turned up in the next 5-10 
minutes if they knew anything about a bag that was sitting here.  After 
then, I'd congratulate myself for saving it from evaporating into thin air 
and move on.

If I then heard a shout about it, I'd probably turn it over on correct 
identification of contents.
