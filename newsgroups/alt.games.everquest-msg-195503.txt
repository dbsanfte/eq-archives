 >My question is if you have a credit card why do you
 >need a "game card".

A couple of reasons I can think of. Having your credit
card number sent out into cyberspace is a scary thing
to a lot of people. They just won't do it, no matter
what security they are promised. Another is that it's
much easier to close your account when using a game
card rather than the credit card. Just wait until the
time is up. With the credit card, you have to make an
effort to stop playing. :)
