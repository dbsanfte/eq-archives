    The big "ulterior motive" is we don't want to sit on our asses at a
zone-in to win a "spawn race" all the damn time. We'd rather be doing
something productive with our time, moving forward. We don't just want to be
big fish in our pond, we want to be a well-respected and known guild
serverwide. You don't get there by wasting time "racing".

    These four sentences summed up what I feel about the whole zerg thing
very nicely, so I wanted to isolate them from everything else. Me too,
Martin, me too.

    It was the opposite. "You want the loot, so you say. So if we give you
the loot, you have no reason to want to kill the mob, so let us have
unlimited attempts." That was their initial bargaining position, by the way.
"You folks stop killing him, and let us have unlimited attempts at it,
because YOU got unlimited attempts at it." Would you agree to that?

    Now imagine after the third kill, another guild that hadn't threatened
to hold you down came along and said "may we attempt Emperor until we kill
him, please, without you trying to kill him?" What would you have said to
them? That was our situation.
