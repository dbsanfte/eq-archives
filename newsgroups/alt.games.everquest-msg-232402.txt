Wow.  You have a point here.  One I hadn't taken into consideration.  My cleric
got to 56 almost entirely on LDON, well, after PC.  My ranger OTOH, started EQ
back in Y2K, before LDON, before knowledge, before nexus, etc.. so my cleric
already knew her way around ... where to go... where not to go.. how not to
die...  I'm going to start another thread on that...

You can check a box that says "show only gear I can use".  Thats all I see.  It
still BITES to see gear I have clearly earned that I cannot use, based on the
way LDON was set up...

wannabes can't go.

The new zones prevent baby farming.  The old ones don't.....

There's the thing... I am not impressed by anything I can *afford* with LDON
points.  So I just keep acquiring them.. That was why I asked.  Maybe I'm
missing a whole lot of gear.  Or, Maybe there are alot of people who ARE
impressed, and I am the only malcontent.  I can live with that, I just wanna
know.  There is ONE augment I like, flowing thought I, but it is only good on
LDON gear, none of which is better than I already have, and lvl 65.....
