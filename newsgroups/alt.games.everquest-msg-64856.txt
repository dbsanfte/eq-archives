Well, I'm hoping that as long as I don't try installing the SoL expansion
pack, and stick with what I have, I'll be alright.  I've got a RAM upgrade
planned, another 64 megs, but that's really about it.  I can't justify
paying $400 for a new motherboard and processor at this point.  It *would*
be rather poopy if the game stops working on my system.

Poopy...  I like that.
