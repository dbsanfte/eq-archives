Last night, I moved my Barb. Warrior to Kunark. When I tried to go up to
the Warrior Trainer, whatever his name is, he pretty much said that he
had no desire to speak with me because I am Barbarian. Will killing gobs
in LoIO increase my faction with this guy so that I can start training?
Fortunately I still have a long way to go before I can train Riposte,
but I'd like to be able to in that area, rather than having to travel
back to BB or the like. So, to reiterate the question, is there any way
to raise what is apparently a racially based faction? Thanks.

Brent
