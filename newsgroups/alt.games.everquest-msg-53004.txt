It drops (dropped) in the new Befallen only. If you zone in and only
find a bunch of lowbie skellies and diseased rats on the first floor
then it is the old Befallen and the sword won't drop. If you get a bunch
of casting mobs, you have the new Befallen.

My ranger has the sword. It drops past the first locked door on the
second floor off a (something) servant. You probably need a full group
of mid-20s at least, to survive. You will be toast solo.
