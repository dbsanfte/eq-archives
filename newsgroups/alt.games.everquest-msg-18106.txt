The scene: I'm medding at the druid ring in lavastorm as a level 14 mage
watching the 40-50 crowd pop in and out heading to Solusek.

L39 Rogue: Which way to Sol A?
Me: Due east.
L39 Rogue: Um... which way is east?

Flash forward

The scene: Sitting on the dock at Sister Island in the Ocean of Tears
waiting for the boat.

L21 Paladin: Which way to garg isle?
Me: SouthWest, there's a canoe over there if you need it.
L21 Paladin: Um... which way is southwest?

Ok I have nothing better to do while medding so I hit sense heading to keep
it maxed right after I ding. You'd think a warrior-type class could do the
same while healing.
