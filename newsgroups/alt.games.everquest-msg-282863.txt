Or because any idea they came up with for a "useful" reward (like
double xp) has already been reserved for use as a veteran reward
(again, like double xp).  Hm, what if the scavenger hunt reward
were a potion that turns you into a Jester of Bristlebane?...

Seriously, I think they missed an opportunity if the reward is just
a firework item, as in the first scavenger hunt (5th anniversary).
They should've taken advantage of new game features, and made the
reward be an evolving item of some sort.

(I now find myself musing over what such an item might do, using the
veteran rewards as a starting point.  What if the item had charges,
but evolved so that later charges are more powerful than earlier
charges?  Would you hurry through the early charges even though it
means the item would be used up sooner?  E.g., 10 charges of "no xp
loss when resurrected", followed by 10 charges of "expedient
recovery" a la the veteran reward, followed by 10 charges of "when
you die, you get an immediate 100% rez", etc.)

Has EQ ever had any items that use variable numbers of charges?
(D&D includes many such items.)  I.e., a rod with 100 charges, and
using power X costs 1 charge, but power Y costs 5 charges, etc.?
