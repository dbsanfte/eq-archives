Paladin healing:
L1  Lay Hands (72 minute recycle time)
L9  Minor Healing (10hp, cost 10 mana)
L12 Meditate (mana regen matters a lot, ask any caster)
L15 Light Healing (30hp, cost 25 mana)
L20 3/tick (total) sitting regen (same as any non- Troll/Iksar L20)
L30 Healing (100hp, cost 60 mana)
L39 Greater Healing (300hp, cost 150 mana)
L39 Divine Purpose (8hp/tick self regen, 1 mana to cast, 3 mana/tick)

Bind Wounds is a nearly complete waste of time for a Paladin, the
benefits do not outweigh even the small expense and inconvenience
of buying/carrying bandages.  Once you have Meditate you can heal
faster by sit/med followed by casting crummy old Minor Healing,
and it seems pretty pointless to me to work on a skill that will
be abandoned at L12 (i.e. the day after you start your char).
Also, I'm not sure why you think L24 is an important breakpoint.
