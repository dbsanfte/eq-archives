Ah, Nips, there's the rub. It's the ultimate paradox, if you'll pardon
the phrase. It almost seems like you have to *be* and uberguild to
*form* an uberguild. :-/

This has been done, and the interest is there. Sadly, we can't even
mount an assault on level 5 of ToFS yet with the folks we have available
to work with. *sigh*.

Easier said, than done. (see below)

There's the key phrase that really cheeses me off. "... that *want* to
move up that quickly. We have SO many really nice people who just seem
to have no interest in getting to 50. And I know that's fine. It's a
*game* for Krist-onna-Kracker's sake, and if they are enjoying
themselves, it's not my place to tell them how to play. But MAN! Is it
ever frustrating.

That's been brought up more times than you can imagine. We have, as part
of our fucking CHARTER, that we do *NOT* powerlevel or twink or consort
with beggars or people asking for such. If you decide to give something
nice to a guildie, or spend some time for little self benefit helping
out a guildmate trying to level, that's fine. But if we get a new member
in who starts crying, "Come powerlevel me!" or "Give me a wurmslayer!"
they are quickly shown the door. You can see the dichotomy here, I'm
sure. We've PL'd a couple, but it's a rare thing. This whole dialogue is
making me wonder if maybe my goals and the guild's aren't the same.
*sigh*.

Yeah, but we have *zero* rep on Xev. We've done nothing. ... NOTHING.
Ok, we've done stuff that's nice and fun for us at our level, but if you
ask somebody from the fucking Harmonium or Alteras Vita who the fuck we
are, they'll be like, "Huh? That's a guild?"  We're starting from
scratch as far as the end game goes, buddy.

Have you ever read the requirements for a couple of Xev's uberguilds for
membership? ;-)     It's not even a game to them anymore. I dread the
thought, and even more dread the thought that I'd likely put up with
those rules to get to the top end.
