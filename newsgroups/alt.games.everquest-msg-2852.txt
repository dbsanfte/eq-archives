The flames on me don't even count stupid.
What's you deal with this, you some kind of sociopath? Why do you care
if they like you or not? You that insecure about yourself? What would be
the difference if anyone liked you or not? You probably think I don't
like you and you're wrong. I don't know you why would I like or dislike
you or anyone?
You redirected me because you thought they would jump all over me and
they didn't. How little are you that you feel that need for others to
support you? Can't you handle it on your own?
If I felt the need to have everyone on the internet love me I would have
come in here being the nicest guy in the world. Unlike you that doesn't
matter to me. Now you're obsessed with something you can't beat.
There's really no point in flaming you because you're doing a nice
enough job of it yourself by crying about me.

Me
