When I was level 18 I went to Kunark.  Got a bind in OT and loved it.  Made
a killing in plat.  The Coctrice drop the beak, over a pp for each one, and
most of the time they drop about a pp too.  Sarnak drop coin, rings, and
random stuff, but hey its cash.  The DE merchant that is in the building
across from the bank gives better prices than the clockwork ones, from my
experience.  Now that I've made 40 its time to move on to see some more of
the world, but I made a ton of cash in the Overthere.
