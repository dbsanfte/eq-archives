Basically, you have to use a little imagination to trigger more dialogue
from the NPC.
For instance, if the NPC says : "I fear the [horrors] that await me", you
can't just reply "horrors" to get him to go on.
Try "What horrors?", or something like that. So, use the word in brackets in
some form of question. Not sure if the "?" in the end is necessary. I always
type it, for correctness.
Some NPC's are broken, though, and won't answer, no matter what you type.
(Anyone ever figured out how to get something from the fisherman i Felwithe
with the missing daughter? I couldn't get anything 2 1/2 years ago, and
still can't!)
Good luck.
