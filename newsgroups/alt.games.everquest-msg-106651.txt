I have petitioned several times and and almost always been content if not
happy with the results. Sometimes it was a quick responce and other times it
took and hour or so. The only time I was really pissed off and raised holly
hell was an incident in which I lost a Tinks bag full of Fs weapons,
tradeing to my other account. I had petition to report it and after 2 an
half hrs no responce. Repetitioned and after an hour still no responce sent
a tell to the GM stating that it was going on 4 hours on a petition with no
responce. His reply was he sees it in the queue and it is second up. After
another hour I have to petition again and send a tell to the lead GM. Well
after about 10 hours with no one responding I logged sent a bunch of Emails
expressing my displeasure, well 2 days later the lead GM contacts me I told
him I was reporting what happened and the location of where it happened, as
per the MOTD. Low and behold the GM appears and gives me a Tinks bag.
