Correct. Usta be that you could modify both damage and delay, and the
pet would use the better of both.  so you could hand the pet a rusty
dagger and it would be doing its 50+ per hit at dagger delay.  They
fixed(nerfed?) the delay on pets to 30, but you can still increase the
damage, after 12 or 16, you really don't want to give it a weapon that
will increase its damage.
