I can't remember the last time I cast pack spirit, but I seem to
recall it overwriting regular sow even then. Nowadays, people tend to
want SoE from me instead of SoW.
Pet peeve: people who beg for wolf form and forget to click off sow
first or don't notice they still have it up (however that's possible)
