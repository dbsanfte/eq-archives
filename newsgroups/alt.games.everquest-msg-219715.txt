Now *that* is an excellent example of a strawman argument.  I see you are
learning.

Take two analogous statements: There are millions of unwanted
[children/pets] born every year.

Take two analogous statements: You are in favor of "fixing" that problem.

That is what is called a directed analogy.  My ending comment could have
been worded a bit better, as I did bring in an unnecessary aspect
("unworthy" needn't have been mentioned).  The strawman occurs when you jump
on that instead of addressing the meat of the analogy.

By the way, my un-fixed male cat (that has been bred in the past) doesn't
spray.  It's called training.
