Hello all,

I currently play on the Tunare server after being merged into it from
E`ci.  I had been on E`ci since server launch, and was quite bummed
about having to merge.  Nonetheless, there was nothing I could do.  It
has been quite some time now since the merger took place, and I am not
particularly enjoying the Tunare crowd.  Lots of 10-year olds it
seems.  I was just wondering what the general atmosphere of E-Marr is
like, and what the size of the population is.  I'm looking to be 70
soon, and hope to get back into raiding.  I am flagged for everything
in PoP, and most things in GoD.  If someone could toss me the
name/website of a guild that I would be well-suited for, that would be
great also!  Thanks for your time!
