I'm level 43, and a million years from Uber, but I fully agree with Ben 
on this: The point of Sleeper's Tomb is to wake the Sleeper, not to pharm 
Primal weapons. If anything, it's a pity that uberguilds spend so long 
pharming the zone before giving the quest its intended resolution.

As far as I'm concerned, the solution would be to empty the loot tables 
of all four warders, and let whoever undertakes the task do it for the 
challenge alone.
