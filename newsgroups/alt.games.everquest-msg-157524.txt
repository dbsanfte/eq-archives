I have NEVER given ANYONE anything but sympathy when VI nerfs something
about their class.

What could possibly make you think that I had done anything like this?

Again, I don't want to get into class envy, but I've been seeing people that
NEVER played a Druid bitch and moan that we were overpowered (when it just
wasn't TRUE, we were VARIED, but not overpowered) for four years now.  Why
the hell would I do the same thing to someone else?
