As does Jeff Sommers....


Blowback!
By Jeff Sommers


In CIA parlance missions that are "successful" create backlashes. The
CIA aptly calls this "Blowback."

At the end of WW II the US took empire from a weakened Britain and
France. Among the first casualties was East Europe, which was sacrificed
on the mantle of superpower relations.  That same deal between
superpowers saw Greece put down by England and the US, with Soviet
compliance. The Soviets and the West also concluded that the people of

both their respective spheres would be put down if necessary in the
interests of "stability." Democracy on both sides of the Cold War divide
was shelved.

The US maintained order during its tenure of hegemony through use of
both covert and overt operations that helped signal the very blowback we
witnessed on the 11th. In 1953 Allen Dulles, brother of Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles, thought it clever to maintain order in Iran by
overthrowing its democratically elected leader, Mohammed Mossadegh. The
popular Mossadegh "erred" when he decided Iran's oil belonged to Iran
and not the multi-national corporations who held "rights" to it. He
nationalized Iran's oil. Allen Dulles sent in the CIA with suitcases
full of money (the CIA had no oversight and so could spend liberally) to
destabilize the government. They sent their agent Kim Roosevelt to
remove Mossadegh. Kim Roosevelt was the grandson of that famous defender
of the Spanish American War that brought the US no end of blowback.
General H. Norman Schwarzkopf accom panied him-no, not the General we
all know who commanded US forces in the Persian Gulf war, but his
father. Schwarzkopf trained the Shah of Iran's secret police in all
sorts and manners of techniques that brutal dictatorships employ against
their citizens. This bought "stability" and the return of oil to its
"rightful" owners. The US oil companies got 40%, the Brits 40%, the
Dutch 14% and the French 6%. Yet, in overthrowing Mossadegh a
25-year-long period of repression was launched against dissenters in
Iran with significant blowback for all parties concerned. Most
significantly this created a radical Islamic fundamentalist response
that led to the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeni. In part, yesterday's
tragedy is blowback from Washington policies executed 50 years back.

During the 1980s the US found another opportunity for CIA mischief in
the Middle East. In 1978 the Soviet Union frowned upon the more radical
Marxist government that arose on its border in Afghanistan. Given that
the Soviets cynically wielded terms like "Marxism" in the same way the
US has often done with "democracy," the Soviets felt no compunction
about overthrowing a radical Marxist government with democratic
impulses. As a superpower it sought obedience. The Soviets installed a
government in Afghanistan loyal to themselves and would suffer blowback
that in part led to the very dissolution of the USSR.

Coming off its own failed decades long attempt to install and maintain
unpopular governments in Vietnam, the US was bemused by the Soviets
finding themselves in a similar situation in Afghanistan. Among
opponents of the Soviet backed regime in Afghanistan were Islamic
fundamentalists. The CIA fanned the flames of fundamentalist fervor in
order to fuel the ant-Soviet Afghani movement, the Mujahadeen. Yet, here
too there would be blowback. When the Soviet Union collapsed the highly
motivated fundamentalist force the US helped create and train in covert
operations (the stuff of terrorism) they now turned their sights on
their former benefactor. The marriage between Afghani fundamentalists
and the CIA was purely one of convenience. When no longer "convenient"
these highly-trained militants could now turn on that other source of
misery in the Middle East: the US. Again, this was blowback.

This begs the question of why the US was perceived as a source of "evil"
by Islamic extremists? We are all familiar with the reasons.  A decade
of bombing and embargoes have left Iraq's electric, water, and health
infrastructure in tatters. Saddam Hussein remains in power, but millions
live in abject misery, and the United Nations' own data shows over
700,000 children having died as a consequence of these US measures
against Iraq. The Iraqi leadership has been unaffected. Hussein has
punished the Kurds in the north of Iraq with impunity and the Shiite
Muslims of the south treated to Hussein's bloody fist too. Yet, Iraq did
not dissolve into separate nations. This was the goal of US policy. This
has been achieved at a terrible human cost and is another reason for
blowback against the US.

The specter of US policy toward Israel continues to haunt America.
Copious amounts of aid flows liberally to the Israeli government and
spills out into Palestinian communities in the form of state violence.
But, peace between Israel and Egypt is critical to Middle East
stability. The US gets little of its oil from the Middle East, but US
oil companies are present there and more importantly oil must flow
freely and predictably for the smooth functioning of the global economy
over which the US presides. Palestinians homes are routinely bulldozed
and its people live under military occupation. When the Arabic nations
try and address this matter civilly in the United Nations, as they just
tried last week at the Durban conference, they are rebuffed by the US.
Consequently, Palestinian children greet with delight the news of
thousands of innocent people dying in the US on the 11th. This is
blowback.

America will make many choices in the near future regarding how to
engage the US. Let's hope it remembers that actions have consequences.
Jingoistic responses can backfire. Blowback might erupt quickly, or
simmer for decades. When it strikes the consequences are devastating. We
are poised to escalate the violence or begin to plumb the depths of our
history in ways that might reveal how we can end these cascading series
of tragedies. Hopefully, reason will prevail.
