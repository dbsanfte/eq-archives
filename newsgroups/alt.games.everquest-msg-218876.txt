But, really, I doubt that the people that would need the objective opinion
will ever have it. Whether you really want kids or not, and whether you
know you might be carrying a genetic defect or not, the decision to have
children is an emotional one. It should be balanced with some objectivity,
certainly, but for the people deciding, it's always going to be a subject
that's close to their heart.
