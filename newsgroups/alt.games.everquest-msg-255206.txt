No, there isn't.  You're wrong.

As someone who has fought with under-20 delay weapons with 100% haste and
parsed, I can assure you, you are wrong.  If the log file only recorded hits
once every 10 seconds, but recorded all of the hits made during that 10
seconds, you would probably say there is a minimum delay of 100.
