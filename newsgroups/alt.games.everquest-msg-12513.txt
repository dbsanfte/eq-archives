I am nearing level 12 with my enchanter (which is rapidly becoming my
favorite character) and had a question.  I got my necromancer and monk from
12-16 in Kurns tower, and was wondering if it was a good place to do the
same with an Enchanter.  I know I lack the Ward Undead spell, but it seems
Chaotic Feedback does as much damage as Ward Undead.  Plus, I was able to
solo there, and while I know an enchanter is a group character, I would love
to race up to 16 for breeze.  If you don't think Kurn's is the place to go,
where is? I am open to other ideas as I wouldn't mind seeing someplace new.
Thanks.  Also, where can I find a GOOD guide to jewelry making and crowd
control?
