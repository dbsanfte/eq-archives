Although that's not the point of my post.

All righty then! I have no idea why I'm following up, since you've
decided that you're Right, and everyone else is Rong, Rong, Rong,
and no more followups from you is necessary. I'll followup anyway,
because I've somehow managed to stay my hand and not reply until
now, but I can hold it in no longer...

BUT ANYWAY, here goes:

A) Why not post here? It's a group about the game. Where else on
Usenet would they turn for advice or flames or whatever they post
about?

2) Where, then, should they post? Point me to the Norwegian-language
EQ group, plz, thx info la~ And don't tell me to post to no.spill,
or whatever the gaming group is called. Where would you expect to
find the EQ experts? alt.games.everquest or some possibly non-existant
generic gaming group in your own language?

III) YOU YOURSELF speak a language that many of the peoples of the
world can't understand. And THIS is what really gets to me. You seem
to be suffering from the delusion that there are NO NON-ENGLISH
SPEAKERS here, so they won't get any responses by posting here.

Know what? I believe all these points have been made further upthread,
and the fact that you can't wrap your head around them frightens me.
A lot.

As to OgreLowbie's post not answering your question? No, I guess it
didn't, it merely included several kinds of hypothetical posts (and
some paraphrased translations of actual posts) that might be made
to this group by non-english-speaking USENET users. So you are
correct, he didn't answer your question as such, and calling him a
moron was obviously the level-headed, adult thing to do. Sigh...
And also plus, your insistence on cutting off the debate here,
saying you will not read any further posts on the subject, sure
is adult behaviour. Childish tantrums? Heaven forbid!

In all sincerety, and not meant to be taken as flamage,

Rune, Not Kidding about being frightened.

PS: Although if you insist on killfiling people who try to explain
these simple concepts to you, PLZ ADD ME TO THE LIZT!

PPS: N� f�r jeg Usenet-politiet p� d�ra, jeg poster jo i en
amerikansk-eid nyhetsgruppe p� norsk! � nei! Vi ses om ti til
femten �r...
