    No, I mean an actual "trick". For example, one of the Zek brothers in
Tactics splits into five near-exact copies after you get the initial version
of him dead. One of these copies hits for a little more than the others, and
when it is killed it splits into five near-exact copies. So the "trick" is
picking out which is the harder hitter, and killing it last each round. It's
a trick because usually a guild would not care about that detail. In this
case, I bet there's a trick like killing them in a certain order lowers the
HPs of all the remaining ones. So instead of killing 12 equally powerful
bosses, you kill successively weaker bosses if you do things right.

    Furor also has a grand history of exaggerating how difficult something
is until he kills it, at which point it becomes "gimp". Him saying something
is "hard" just means he hasn't found the trick that makes it "gimp" yet.

    Lord knows. I'm not even sure that TimeA and TimeB are finished and
bug-free!

    That is the theory at this time. I think it'll be a lot more like every
other PoP zone: each "sector" in TimeA will be a trial, with its own flag
and miniboss. Get all the trials done, you're flagged for TimeB. If these
trials are like the ones in other zones, they should be "reward"-type
encounters and should fall fairly fast. Two weeks, say, to clear them all,
being generous? That's including the possibility of some sort of trial in
PoInnovation, as a certain area of the zone seems to point to events there.

> How long until PoP is *DONE*, and who will do it? ;-)

    Well, let's keep with the estimation. I'll go with about two weeks from
now until Rathe Council dies. Afterlife has been at it for a week now, and
it is a toughie, but there's a new game coming out that competes with EQ and
it's in SOE's best interests to at least have people in PoTimeA before that
release happens. So March 21st, Rathe down. I will also assume that the key
quest for Time is individual, and requires minimal farming (which if my
guess is right has already been done). So TimeA will be entered right after
Rathe falls. Two weeks for TimeA, that takes us to April 4th or so. I'll
call for the entire rest of the month of April to figure out and overcome
TimeB. It may require some TimeA gearing up to handle, and unlike other
zones where you fight "the big boss" there's every indication there could be
a few "big bosses" in TimeB. So my prediction is sometime in May, most
likely in the first week or two. This all assumes that none of the bosses or
trials involved are blowable spawns, but can be tried non-stop.

    As for who? Too close to call. Afterlife has about a week on FoH, but
that sort of minor lead can evaporate pretty fast on mobs that can't be
blown. I'll go with AL for now, but this is one of those bets where I
wouldn't place too much money down.

    Can we change the jar contents to gummi bears? Those are much tastier!
