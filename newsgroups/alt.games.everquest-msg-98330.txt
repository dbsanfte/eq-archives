Unless the info at Caster's Realm is wrong, though, the level 12 corpse
summoning spell takes a coffin.  That's something like 150 plat, isn't
it?  Not many non-twinked low level people are going to be able to
afford corpse summoning (especially when most of their wealth will be
tied up in equipment on the corpse).  It will be no problem for twinks,
but twinks are not likely to need it.
