I *think* it was added in the last major patch before SoL release.  
Somewhere in the october/november timeframe.  I'm not sure if it was 
announced, but it was discussed at length on the bard boards.  The intial 
consensus was that it made it easier for lazy bards to twist.  Now that 
bards are getting the AE songs, the utility is increased greatly.  (The AE 
songs don't give a message, so twisting AE FR/CR, AE mana, and a third 
song would take very good timing.
Oh, the only real downside to the casting bar is that it can hide your 
breath meter if you're under water without an EB item.
