Many web site owners who have asked for less than that to cover bandwidth costs
would disagree.  Getting $3/month out of people is like pulling teeth.

The timing is bad on this.  We've just been through a $30 expansion, and PoP
is coming up, so we've got another $30 expansion on the horizon.  With
expansion costs, EQ is already a $13-$15/month game.  $3/month more on top of
that is going to seem excessive to a lot of people.  I'd like to see them go
to $14-$15/month, but include expansions in that.
