Get a popup killer. Why pay?

(Sorry, I would have donated had they not started flinging popups in
my face. Once the popups (SEVERAL per page change sometimes) started
flying like mad, they lost any chance they had of me "donating"...
Even a popup or two when I first came to the site would have been
fine, but we're talking multiple popups every page change.)
