I am another non-fan of the random name generator - I've run it a
couple times just for the fun of seeing what it'd come up with and
would never use it to create a name.
The name generator has the feel of something that read Tolkien,
identified which words were names, but completely failed to grasp
their meaning and half of the rules for constructing names (they did
figure out that -iel is a common female ending). If I should ever want
a name that looked elven rather than getting one from my star charts,
I'd peruse the appendices of Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion.
