Yeah, I'm with you, I strangely had the opposite argh. :) I had friends 
who were more than happy to do all the combines for me, got to level 50, 
and went Argh!...  I'm a 250 Jeweler, 130 Tailor, 120 Smith blah blah, and 
my research skill is 3!

So now I've been slowly but surely working it up.  I broke 60 last night, 
yay!  I kinda wish I'd done it when it might still be of use to me, but 
it's nice to think I'll be able to make spells for other folks at some 
point, to return the favors done for me.
