    High Keep Apathy is my theory.

    People go there for 10 levels (i spent 14 there on my first character)
and spend 90% of it sitting on their butt waiting for overcon goblins to
pop, listening to Isabella Cellus tell nobody in particular to stop
following her or watching idiots fight with one another over nothing because
of overcrowding or because some stupid iksar monk is soloing the LR again or
somebody's killed Captain Bopeep and they cant hand in their goblin ears for
their 2 cent faction boost and fistfull of weighty worthless coinage or
because some level 60 druid is "powerlevelling" a level 3 nobody with a dmg
shield and some buffs and traning every mob in the zone to them to do it. By
the time I was regularly camping the warrior room I spent many hours no
longer bothering to talk, definitely not caring who looted and who didnt, so
long as mobs died and i got experience and crawled closer to lvl 30 so i
could get out of there for good.

    High keep has the worst vibe in the game and suffers constant problems
due to the fact that spawn rates have nothing to do with how fast mobs are
killed or how many people are in the zone. Despite that, its excellent
experience 20-30 (slightly wider range than that if you can stand it) so
people still flock to it and suffer the consequences. Actually, having been
back to solo guards in my 40's, its only the goblin spawns that are a
problem. People killing guards tend to consider them free for all... hrm
