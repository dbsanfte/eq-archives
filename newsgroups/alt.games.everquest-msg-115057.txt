Ah, so he was heading home. Probably a Vindi try that went south or
somesuch. We normally camp Arena a bit north of where you are, up the
ramp in in the left corner.  Still can't suss why he would have whacked
the bard and left the rest of the party alone.  If he'd been outbound in
hot pursuit I could see it, but not wandering home with a clear hate
list.

Very odd.
