MS is unimpressive exp. Unusually high hp for some of the mobs there
and many of them are kos with fairly high aggro ranges leading to
extra downtime when the aggro gets out of control (or longer pull
times if you stay clear). They die easy enough, it's just slow.

Something is wrong with NL. That is probably the worst exp zone in the
entire world. If you are hunting for exp, stay clear of there.

HK is obviously the best as most people by now know, making it
overcrowded (but not on test!) but if you can get the WR and RR
together, nothing can match it.
