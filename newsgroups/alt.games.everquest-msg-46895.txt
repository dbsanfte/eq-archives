I deleted my druid. I've never been comfortable
with cross gender characters anyway, so it was
no real strain. 

I the created a bard. After character creation,
up pops a MOTD that informs me that I am now
level 30. This turned out to be in error as I am
now apparently level 24. While I was delighted
in some ways, in others I was less than thrilled
with this. I don't mind skipping levels 1-5 at
all. But I have never played a bard before and I
am somewhat lacking those skills.

On the other hand, a little mob killing and I am
cruising around Norrath with Selo's and a set of
drums.

The server was down to what I would term normal
population levels today. I play during off-hours
anyway and there were maybe 24 people in Greater
Faydark. This is actually slightly higher than
the normal number for the same time on my
regular server. 

I'm still pondering what to do with my
force-grown character. She is lacking all but 3
songs and any sort of armor. I don't have the
playing skills for a level 24 bard.It looks like
there will be a lot of solo action in the
future.

Bards are one of the least popular classes on
normal servers, but at least 15% of the
characters I saw today were bards. Are bards
natural role-players or are people who role-play
attracted to bards? Of course it may be that
most the people playing bards decided the way I
did. Bards simply can out run darn near
anything. Which is awfully handy on a server
full of lowbies with the resulting massive
trains.
