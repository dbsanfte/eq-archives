As RJB pointed out its not too hard to set up once you know how.  They 
work like kick et al on EQ characters; they grey out on use, and 
eventually come active again so you can use them again.  But you can 
only use them if your weapon lets you, and you meet the skill 
requirement to use them with your weapon.  It would be similar to 
needing special boots, and then each pair of boots that permits kick 
having a different level of kick skill needed to use the button.

Similar skills work in melee; brawl and the like, more ways to do a bit 
of extra damage.

Covering the slots isn't a big deal, unless you are actually getting 
useful bonuses off them.  There are over 40 skills in the game and you 
probably only use 10 of them; and of the ones you do use, a few points 
in most of them won't make any difference.  I have run accross a few 
implants which really made a difference; raising my nano related skills 
to where I could use one of my nano crystals at an earlier level; sort 
of like being able to memorize a level 5 spell in EQ at only 4th level.

I am annoyed by how far I often have to run to do a mission, this is one 
point where EQ LDoN missions have an advantage; you know where you are 
going and its not all -that- far from the adventure camps.  The binding 
thing isn't too difficult though, as has already been explained by 
Palindrome.
