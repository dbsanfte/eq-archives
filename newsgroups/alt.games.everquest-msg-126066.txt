Thanks to all those that responded!

You confirmed two things for me:

1) It's not just on TZ where the dervs are gone

2) It's still possible to find a young ronin in S. Ro. and even Oasis

And gave me some great help in getting the Ronin to spawn
without getting killed - kill a lot of undead and rares.

I'm not sure what is rare there though.  Someone said dune spiders
and I've also heard "an asp" (as opposed to "a cistern asp") is rare.
I had looked for "an asp" and never found and in S. Ro.

Any other rares to note?

I'll keep a close eye on the NW area of the zone again.  That
would be sweet if he spawned there!


Thanks again!

- Corey
