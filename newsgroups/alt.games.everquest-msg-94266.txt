...and if you find one of these instances and use it to your advantage
(nuke, jump, nuke, jump, nuke, jump while watching the critter go back &
forth, never hitting you) and a GM sees you, perhaps that's what rc meant by
"be warned" 'cause that's what'll happen to you.  It's an exploit any time a
critter has ZERO chance of killing you.
