Its so easy to look up on hotbot. Wow, daylight savings
is basically some crazy thing left over from the world wars
for the most part and never really needed for farming or such, really
only becoming law after the war because various places were observing
it on their
own anyway. This one has the most detail, and sources.

"Early adoption in law 
Daylight Saving Time has been used in the United States and in many
European countries since World War I. 

During World War I, in an effort to conserve fuel needed to produce
electric power, Germany and Austria took time by the forelock, and
began saving daylight at 11 p.m. on the 30th of April, 1916, by
advancing the hands of the clock one hour until the following October.
This action was immediately followed by other countries in Europe,
Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Italy, France and
Portugal. Britian began 3 weeks later, on 21 May 1916. In 1917,
Australia, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia initiated it. 

The plan was not formally adopted in the United States until 1918. 

'An Act to preserve daylight and provide standard time for the United
States' was enacted on March 19, 1918. [See law] It both established
standard time zones and set summer DST to begin on 31 March 31 1918.
It placed the country on Daylight Saving Time for the remainder of WW
I, and was observed for seven months in 1918 and 1919. The law,
however, proved so unpopular (mostly because people rose earlier and
went to bed earlier than we do today) that the law was later repealed
in 1919 over President Wilson's veto. It became a local option, and
was continued in a few states (Massachusetts, Rhode Island) and some
cities (New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and others).

During World War II, President Roosevelt instituted year-round
Daylight Saving Time, called 'War Time.' (from 2 February 1942 to 30
September 1945). [See law] From 1945 to 1966, there was no federal law
about Daylight Saving Time. So states and localities were free to
choose whether to observe Daylight Saving Time and could choose when
it began and ended. This, however, caused confusion -- especially for
the broadcasting industry, and for railways, airlines, and bus
companies. Because of the different local customs and laws, radio and
TV stations and the transportation companies had to publish new
schedules every time a state or town began or ended Daylight Saving
Time.

On 4 January 1974, Nixon signed into law the Daylight Saving Time
Energy Act of 1973. Then, beginning on 6 January 1974, implementing
the Daylight Saving Time Energy Act, clocks were set ahead for a
fifteen-month period through 27 April 1975.

In 1972, Congress revised the law to provide that, if a State was in
two or more time zones, the State could exempt the part of the State
that was in one time zone while providing that the part of the State
in a different time zone would observe Daylight Saving Time. The
Federal law was amended in 1986 to begin Daylight Saving Time on the
first Sunday in April.

Under legislation enacted in 1986, Daylight Saving Time in the USA

begins at 2 a.m. on the first Sunday of April and 
ends at 2 a.m. on the last Sunday of October 
In most of the countries of western Europe, including the countries
that are members of the EEC, Daylight Saving Time:

begins at 1 a.m. GMT on the last Sunday of March and 
ends at 1 a.m. GMT on the last Sunday of October 
Observance of Daylight Saving Time elsewhere in the world is highly
variable."

"Congress and President Reagan change Daylight Saving Time

Daylight Saving Time was changed slightly in 1986 when President
Reagan signed Public Law 99-359. It changed Daylight Saving Time from
the last Sunday in April to the first Sunday in April. No change was
made to the ending date of the last Sunday in October.

This was done ostensibly to conserve energy during the month of April.
Adding the entire month of April is estimated to save nationwide about
300,000 barrels of oil each year."

Indiana has three seperate time arrangements with the central
(Indianapolis, and most of Indiana, including Bloomington) being on
standard(EST) and never changing along with Arizona and Hawaii which
are always on standard time.
