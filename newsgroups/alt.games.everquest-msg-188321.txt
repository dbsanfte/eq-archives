Zakmuk lived on a 300MHz Pentium 2 with 192 MB of RAM before he
went to troll heaven.  He has been deleted in favor of some other
race/class which I haven't decided yet.  This experience has
bummed me out on EQ so bad that it may be a while before I start
a replacement.  It seems the original game is not much more than
a replacement for Freecell nowadays.  If you don't want to hassle
with all the expansions there's not much you can do anymore
except enjoy (which I do) the low level game -- but trolls living
in the original world are pretty much out of luck.

PD
