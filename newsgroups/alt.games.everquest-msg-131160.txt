I'm on Solsic Ro server.
I usually play early morning (so controlling camps shouldn't be as hard as
you'd think).  I'm on as early as about 12:30 or as late as 3 AM, up to
about 6-8AM.  The only other times I'd be available are some Tuesdays,
Tuesday evenings/nights, and Sunday days, evenings, & nights.
    Question is what LV are the bandits I'm fighting?  Remember I can NOT
fight or tank even one bit (no armor...well I did have an 6AC +1 Mana robe
in my bank).  I'm just a bubble (maybe 4 blues) under 23.
    Empty slots?  8 backpacks, 1 with 4 food 4 drink (stacks).  Another
filled with bandages & bone chips.  So I've got 6 free backpacks.  I guess
once I can buy/sell to merchants, I should bind right next to one for an
encumbered gate back?  How long till I get to apprehensive?  Forgot if I'm
at scowls or threateningly to start.  Only killed a few (less than 10)
gnolls so far on a run into Everfrost (for an attempt at EXP there, but
decided against it).
