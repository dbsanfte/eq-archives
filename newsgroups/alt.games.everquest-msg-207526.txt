What does 'short time' mean? A Week?
Sounds like its going to be a crowded KS fest like GM events.

About friggin time. I always thought failing on slicing cake was a bit much.

Good change.

LOL. Clarity for the pet? Will this make the wizard fire pets marginally
more
useful?

Wow excellent, makes the KEI nerf for the whiners less painful.

The melee classes need more than this. I hope this is just the fist of a lot
of
changes coming.

Does anyone actually use Instill Doubt? Its suicide in a dungeon and
problematic
at best in outdoor zones. I used it a few times on my monk but it was a
pain.

Oh damn that's a nice change.

Woot!

Ummm why would I want to filter that out?

Like moving mana pumps out of the healing cateory? /boggle =)
