Bah, now I'm confused.  Maybe it's just me, but when I say I drive on
the right, I generally mean MY RIGHT.  Now if I say I'm zoning right,
I generally mean MY RIGHT.  Now if I'm zoning with a train, I'm gonna
be moving with all proper speed, and generally not running backwards,
which should prevent any confusion.  Remember, these zones generally
have a long hallway area, then a clearly defined intersection, with
one path going right, and the other going left.  By the time you are
in the hallway, you should be shouting for all to hear, and you should
know where you're going.  If you're running backwards at this point,
you should hope you have a friendly cleric nearby.
It's taken a while, but I've noticed that on Innoruuk most of the time
all the medding and rezzing is on the left side (that's left if you
were trying to zone out), and all the trains are dragged to the right.
I think clerics refusing to rez those who trained left may have had
something to do with it.  Of course then you have the idiots who zone
in, sit in the corner, and when they see a train run by to the right,
try and grab one mob, then run back to the left hoping for help, and
drag the entire train right onto the medding/rezzing folks.  I think
refusing to rez these idiots doesn't go far enough.  I want a way to
mutilate their corpses.
