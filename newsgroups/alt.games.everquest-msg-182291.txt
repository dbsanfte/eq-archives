Bah.  I still have those!  In 38 levels of re-playing a rogue, I 
apparently forgot the DL lay of the land a bit more than I thought - I 
wandered off track trying to find the stupid tunnel back to the spires.  
Finally find said stupid tunnel and run in.  And in, and in, and in, and 
iGYAHHHHHHHHHHHGH.  Turns out that I'd never gotten the memo about there 
being *two* tunnels in DL, and came around the corner to a giant yeti.  
And hey, when you're a rogue, NOTHING light blue or over is good news. 
:)

(PS shut up meem)
