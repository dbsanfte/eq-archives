Yes, in the Plane of "W", John Kerry has been nerfed.  He no longer is a danger
and can be kited easily by non-liberals.  The weapon he had no longer procs the
"full of crap" effect that had been stinging PC's.

Also, in related information, in the Plane of Senate and the Plane of the
House, all random liberal MOBS have been reduced in level accordingly.  We here
at EQ have also listened to the majority and have ended the PC marriages
between members of the same sex.

Thanks to all and one last message to the liberals...."YOU ARE IN OUR WORLD
NOW!!!!!!!!!!!"
