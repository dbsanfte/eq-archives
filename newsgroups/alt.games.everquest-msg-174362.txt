You being lazy does not make buying PoP a necessity.

People here played for 3+ years with no easy transportation sytem (not even
a nexus), with a LOT less porters around... so I have a hard time finding
sympathy for you.

No Im not one of the "well i suffered, and so should you!" people... but I
just don't but that claim as a requirement to play the game.

They are - the one your buying (bought?) was released before PoP was even
out.
As new expansions come out, the old compilations become cheaper

The real cost is when you have 6 accounts and it comes to new expansions
time :(
