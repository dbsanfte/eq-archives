Yes, move. The area around Kaladim is widely regarded as the WORST newbie
area.

Send your level 6th Paladin to Kelethin (turn left and follow path out of
Kaladim, taking the left fork at each turn until you get to the gap in the
mountains, go thru that and you are in Greater Feydark, Kelethin is at loc
0,0) and fight at the Orc hill for a couple of levels, or even enter the
Lair of the CrushBone Orcs (sounds exciting huh?)

OR, you can take a RIGHT out of Kaladim, and follow the path to the docks
and take the boat (at the LEFT docks)to Freeport(20 minute ride to there),
there are several places for a level 6 to hunt near Freeport, The Desert of
North Ro and  East Commons both have appropriate leveled monsters for you to
fight.

Upon arrival at either place get a BIND (this resets the place you appear
when you die). If you don't do this, when you die your body will be where
you dies, and you'll have to run the whole way from Kaladim to retrieve it.
If you follow either of these suggestions you will soon be fighting more
dangerous creatures, and meeting more people of your level to group with.
