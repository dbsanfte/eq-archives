OK lets say you have 50th level Uber Munchkin on Game X but you want to play
Game Y...you've never played Game Y further than the low levels but you like
the game so you want you 50th level UM on Game Y...all of a sudden you are
playing the high end game without a clue what to do.
Would you really want someone that has played a warrior to 10th level (and
that is all) with you on a Hate raid with a 50th level warrior, even if he
wasn't SA or MA he'd be a liability...just like an Ebay'r.

How are Company Y going to get details of your character from Game X? What,
YOUR going to tell them? Yeah right, "No honest, I was top level with all
the best equipment (I found on Allakhazams)" that'll work. The only way
Company Y could confirm your characters details is by verifying them with
Company X, which is not going to happen.

Well, enjoy the wait.
