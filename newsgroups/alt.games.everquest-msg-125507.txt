How would one go about accessing the Test Server?  My friend told me to go
into the EQ folder and click on the EQtestserver.exe Icon.  This did not
work though all it did was download files and refer me to advance on the
login screen I go to the log in screen and there is nothing that directs me
to go to the Test Server any ideas?
