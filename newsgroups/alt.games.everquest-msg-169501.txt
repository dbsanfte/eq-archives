For higher end encounters, generally you need 3 enchanters and 9 clerics, if
that's a hint.  (There are a few higher end bosses where more enchanters are
useful, such as Blood of Ssra.)  But in general, if a raid leader with 3
enchanters and 9 clerics were given the choice of adding one more player, he
would take a 10th cleric before a 4th chanter.  You really only MUST have one
enchanter for most bosses, but you MUST have 6-8 clerics.

For grouping, enchanter is like an instant barrage of invitations, but a good
cleric does not have trouble finding groups either.

For soloing, enchanter is better, but cleric can solo with some effectiveness
through Level 52 as long as they have C2.  Think undead.  After that, I don't
know, I haven't tried that hard and my few solo attempts have been
unsatisfactory.

Have you thought about a necro or shaman? They are very useful in higher end
groups/raids and excellent solo.  They are a little harder to get groups with,
however.

I haven't played in Tier II PoP zones yet, btw, so I don't know about them.
