Anyone know if this quest is possible for a DE SK to complete? Looking
over the quests listed at Allakhazam's for ones to raise SteelWarriors,
I don't see any that I could do. I tried giving milk to the guy by the
lake in WC, but he took the milk and just babbled something about how we
couldn't get along. I can easily just go do the quest with my enchanter,
but I'd like to, you know, actually earn it with the SK if possible.
Anyone have any info that would help? I'm not averse to actually doing
some work to raise faction (although I don't think I want to kill 1000
gnolls in BB either). Thanks.
