It's a small point, Rumble, but you obviously missed where he said he was 
old world only and had no access to the bazaar...

Allakhazam's is a brilliant site if you chip in your $5 or however much it 
is.  You can actually search their database for your race/class, weapons, 
a level or price limit, tagged MAGIC, stuff from certain expansions only.
The level/price caps are pretty shaky, but it's a start.  As to actual 
suggestions... hm.

There should be a newbie weapon quested from the same guy who got you your 
newbie armor, and I believe it's magical.

Tentacle Whip from Najena... sucky ratio, but it procs a lifetap!

In a few levels you might try for a Polished Granite Tomahawk in Highhold 
Pass.

There's the blackened alloy longsword from runnyeye, and the wakizashi of 
frozen skies from stonebrunt.

Try specifically asking an enchanter if they do any jewelcrafting. the 
item you want is a Silver Jasper Ring.  If they try to charge you more 
than 10pp, they're greedy bastards.

And Wnone, please don't top post.  There's many here who get grumpy about 
that.
