Wisps have around 300 hit points.  Ignite does 30-37 points damage for
30 mana.  Why aren't you using Stinging Swarm?  117 points of damage
for 65 mana.

Try something like this: snare, root, SS, back up and sit down and
meditate (if you are brave...WC can be rather frightening at 15, so you
may want to keep your eyes open).  Reroot as necessary.  When SS wears
off, reapply it, put on Shield of Thistles (you already have Thistecoat
on, and Firefist, right?), and go melee the thing.  With the 234 damage
that the two SS's will contribute, you only need to do a bit under 100
points of melee damage to kill that wisp.  (Consider a Flamelick just
before meleeing...that's another 24 damage).  Every time the wisp hits
you, it takes 5 or 6 from SoT and 1 from Thistlecoat, so even if your
melee sucks, you should win.

For a magical weapon, if you can afford about 100 plat, consider taking
a trip over to Velious and buying a Coldain weapon from the vendors.
They are magical, and proc a DD spell, which does about 12 points, if I
recall correctly.

Depending on your melee skill and armor, you might find it better to use
one SS and go right to melee.  Or, you might find it better to use SS 3
times, rooting as often as necessary.  Play around, you'll find
something that works for you.

BTW, don't forget Harmony.  If you have a wisp rooted, and you see
another one coming toward you, cast Harmony on the incoming wisp.  That
will let it pass on by the one you have rooted without picking up aggro.

West Commons has plenty of animals, so you might also play around with
using a charmed animal against the wisps.  Some people have great
success charming animals, others find that the hassle of dealing with a
pissed off animal when charm wears off is not worth it.  Experiment!
