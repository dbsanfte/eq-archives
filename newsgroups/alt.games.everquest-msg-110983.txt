Seriously, I've not seen either of those things suggested. The closest
was that the complaints by Christians seems empty when viewed in light
of what other religions go through (I surely wouldn't want to be
dealing with the BS that the average Muslim must be going through
lately). I've not seen anyone imply that it's ok to discriminate
against Christians, for any reason.
