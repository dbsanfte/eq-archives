Is her name Yiyoni, nothing more just Yiyoni? ;)

I agree, though you can't get virtually preggers in EQ that is still
something VERY naughty for you two to be doing and frankly I'm
surprised and just a tad ashamed of you, bad bad bad!

Oh nevermind, thought you were talking about something else.. how
embarrassing.

Basically have someone who can snare, in any form. Even without sow
you can then escape stuff. Or in West Karana you'd run to the guards
and concentrate on the bandit.. the guards will kill the other things.
They don't kill the bandits though.

Yep, best to snare. Even the cleric of innoruuk neck thing my dark elf
cleric got at level 20 with clinging darkness has saved her behind
thousands of times. Stop, snare, run like hell. Its much more
dependable than tryint to root (the item is fairly long cast
though,spells are short)

Best thing to do is to get used to using sense direction in zones like
that. Like know which way the zone to qey hills is and know which way
the water is in west k, you won't get lost then.

Aahahha.

Don't forget the bandit thing though, they merrily stand there
watching the bandit kill you.

Ahaha yeah they really should have made old roads clearer, most of the
newer add on ones were made more obvious.

Its not SUPER bad with auto run and a button /corpse, but yeah it is
tiresome.

But if you hear some farmer yell the swarm is coming, get the heck
away from the area of the Millers farm, or you WILL think its a bad
rash. In north karana its the area of that guard tower near the
gypsies.
