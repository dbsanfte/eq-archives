I was about to log in WC with my baby rogue when I saw this fellow come
running down the path.  I conned him and he was green and realized he wasn't
a player-character.  I was right near the zoneline when he did this and he
said something to the effect of "too late, I'm gone.  You lose!"  and was
gone.

Any idea who this freak was?  It didn't list it in the beastiary on
EQatlas.com.

TIA,
Sean...
