Tell me about it.  I thought tradeskills could get 
boring :)  I'd ignore it too, only level 19's damage 
spells are all conjuration-based.  And guess which skill 
sucks? :)  (Well, okay, quite a few do - but that one is 
painfully bad)

To increase the amusement, I think I'll find a vendor 
selling the spirit pouch spell (mage guild in Freep 
should have it, yes?) and start giving em away.  With a 
warning, of course.  ::hugs second Staff of Writhing 
tight::

(Okay, so my *mage* has the SoW - but I'd rather not 
lose that jade chokidai prod, either :) )
