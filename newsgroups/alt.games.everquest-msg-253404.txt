I'm sorry that was a little confusing. My main character has all the
expansions but GoD, while my Alt has only Kunark and Velious.

I guss I'll just have to plunk down some money to buy the expansions.
The EQ platnum looks pretty good, $30 for all the expansions up to
GoD. Been wanting to take my Warrior to Nardox, Gunthak, and the rest
soon anyway.

Thanks for the assistance.
