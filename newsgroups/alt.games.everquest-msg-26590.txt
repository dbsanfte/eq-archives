Field of Bone is like that on ALL the servers.  It appears that if you're 
under 13, THE thing to do is make an Iksar Monk.  Besides, Kunark is 
relatively isolated from the rest of the server.

If you want to see what it's really like on Sullon Vek, make a dwarf or

perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
