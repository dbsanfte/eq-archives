Speaking of low risk, I was able to go from the start of level 41 to
level 42 in about 8 hours soloing Shakrn Meadowgreen and chargers at the
centaur village in South Karana. His brother Ulan will not attack
because he is a merchant; the lower level centaurs will not attack
either. There is also no faction loss.

The centaurs are on a six-minute spawn so after I killed Shakrn, I'd
wander around to the other stables, killing chargers, or if I couldn't
find any, killing placeholders. They all drop gems, large chainmail,
bronze and up to 4pp; you can sell all the heavy stuff to Ulan. So in
addition to easy leveling I was making about 60 to 80pp per hour from
the loot. I also leveled from 42 to 43 here although it took maybe 12
hours of fighting because Shakrn and the chargers were high green more
often.

I think only a hybrid (I'm a paladin) or maybe a strong pet class could
have done this solo in 8 hours however. A pure melee would take too long
to heal in 6 minutes and a caster too long to regain mana.

Note I said could have. VI added Jarlen Meadowgreen as part of the
recent patch that added baking quests and he is about as tough as Shakrn
and stands right next to him. But he occasionally wanders out to the
fire to check on his bread so you still may be able to do it but at a
slower rate. I think Jarlen's spawn time is also longer than 6 minutes.
