You've <still> dodged the point.

For the sake of not making you out as a hypocrite, could you please explain
your position, since I was good enough to explain mine, concerning Matt
Frisch?

I have no reason to "tattle" on anyone, since I find the practice one
employed by people of low self-esteem.  All I'm pointing out is the
selective attitude of this group toward people who either don't share their
views, or piss this group off so bad that they feel a genuine desire to lash
out and hurt someone in the real world.  This forum is nothing but words.
Let me repeat that for the selective readers out there...  It's nothing but
words.  Words can never hurt you.  One more time...  Words can <never> hurt
you.

Now go, practice your breathing techniques, go outside and check out the
<real> world.
