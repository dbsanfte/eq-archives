It is a lot like DAoC, except there isn't as much segregation. After 
about level 20 all the zones are contested and you can be killed (on the 
PvP servers). The non-PvP servers have consensual only. The players can 
flag themselves as PvP and go after the opposing faction. You can never 
kill one of your own faction, although they are rumored to offer a free-
for-all server if there is enough of a desire for it.
