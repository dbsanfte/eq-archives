In the low teens, they work well in a group - primarily as a tankish
type.  I usually buff my pet (and encourage others to buff it with
ac/hp type stuff as well) and send it in.  Maybe toss a heal at it
then I join the fray as well.  Solo, pooch and I can take yellows
pretty confidently - in groups we try for yellow and red only cons.
