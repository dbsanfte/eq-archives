Yeah, I had ported to BB last night to pick up a spell someone was selling
at the Gfay bank, and ran across this mob.  For a moment, I was stunned (no,
he didn't stun me as in hit me and I couldn't move... :) waaaaay green at
lev 52).  I just stood at him, staring, as he kept trying to whack me..
finally, I just let off one nuke and went on my way again... Heh.. was -not-
expecting to see a troll mob in Butcher Block.. :)
