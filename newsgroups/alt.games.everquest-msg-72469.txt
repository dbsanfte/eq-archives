as a thought try going to download.com and look under internet utilities.
look for a program that stops idle cut offs. they work by pinging an ip like
every 1hr or something so ur ISP thinks ur active, this would work for u if
the packet consistency is ur problem, thought I cant say it sounds like its
right? Surely any packet activity is non idle activity?? Check Internet
Explorer -> Tools -> Options -> Connections and see if you have a cut off or
something set on that tab.
