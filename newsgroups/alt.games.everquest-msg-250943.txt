Unfortunately, through tracking there is no way to target that mob.  (Some
spells do this, like Sense Animal or Sense Undead.  But they do not keep the
same target, just the nearest of the class of mob that is sensed.)

My understanding is that increasing skill as a tracker increases the range
at which mobs may be tracked and this is the only thing that changes with
increased skill.

When tracking I let the track message run.  If you are attacking the mob you
targeted, sometimes the mob will warp and you can continue the battle
because you have that same one targeted  for track.  Other times, on the
death of a subject, I just continue pursuit without retracking.  However, if
you want to turn the track message off without opening the track screen a
recent command was given to us.  That command is /stoptrack     .
