Just wanted to mention that I'm eternally indebted to Karamarkh, late of
Kaladim, for the assistance he showed me recently while I was wandering in
the Faydark.

It's players like this who make the game the enjoyable experience that it
is.  When someone's willing to go out of their way to help you it makes you
want to pass it on.  Probably a lesson for real life there, too...  :o)

Cheers, dude.
