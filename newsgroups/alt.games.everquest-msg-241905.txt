This was implemented a while back in one of the patches. In addition 
to right clicking on the empty spell gems, you can also right click on

the mini book icon to give you another list. The second list will allow

you to save the current contents of your 8 spell gems as a "spell set".

You can then right click on the book icon and load the spell set 
whenever you want (you'll sit like you're medding and the spells will 
automatically start to be memorized). You can have a maximum of 8 
spell sets saved at any one time, and they can be deleted as well in 
that menu if you need to replace a set or two.
