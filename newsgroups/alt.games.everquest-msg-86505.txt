Opinion here:...  I believe that an optimal group is not necessarily
made up of certain classes... but made up of individuals that KNOW
their class and the others they are grouped with.

I like all the classes.. and feel each has certain traits that are
great in a group....   Often I hear that Wizards and Necros are not
desired.... Hell Id rather have a necro in my group... they can ghetto
heal, mez, and bring a tank.  Wizards... well I have made some of my
best exp with a caster heavy group.  Wizards and Mages... Gawd how
they rock.

YMMV
