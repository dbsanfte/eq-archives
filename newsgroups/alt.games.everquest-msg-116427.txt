 I seem to have a little trouble getting spells to take hold on things at
times. I'm talking about things in the blue not trying to take on things
that are higher level. I have snare and root resisted alot lately. I have
heard that Cha. makes a big difference in this but don't know personally.
All other stats are pretty good on druid but Cha., it's sitting right where
the game started, just on 75. Thanks for any help on this.
