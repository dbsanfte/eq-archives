The problem is it has *absolutly* no depth.
Took me 6 weeks to make four chars which are now
29,30,35,54,also around 150 AAs all in all,oh this was with
experience locked,one of the best features in EQ2 or I would
have been max level in a week. ;)
Leveling is so uncredibly easy,not to mention one gets AAs along
with no effort just by running through zones,that there is absolutly
no feeling of an achievement once one reaches a certain level like
in EQ1.
The only thing slightly challenging is the user interface.
In the 6 weeks I activly played I didnt 
manage to get familiar with the clumsy and overburdened interface
and this after 6 years EQ1.Even long time players 
have problems finding certain functions as I found out after I asked
if there is something like "hitmodes" in EQ1,asked several times
in world chat without repsonse or people telling me they dont know
what I mean although  the function exists after I found out after a
longish search.

For me this is an absolute joke,and has nothing to do with the game
being made for the "casual" gamer,its more made for the average
lamer with the attention span of a fly and the socializing skills of 
an eremite.
I also hate the concept of a MMORPG for soloists,I am not there to
be ones background sound tapestry,I suggest one plays Oblivion
or something like that,joining MMORPGs to solo destroys them.

Tecnical its the same old shit which made me quit EQ1,instable with
lots of server downtime,which inevitable leads me to the conclusion
SOE continues to drive the game on the cheapest hardware possible
with the lowest possible number of employees working on it.
As in EQ1 year old bugs stay unfixed and SOE still impertinently tries
to blame the customers or even MS.

Fortunatly a rl friend let me play on his account so I didnt had to
shove another handful of Dollars into SOE's fat ass. 

All in all I am disgusted with the direction the MMORPG genre took
the last years,reminds me of TV,along with becoming more and more
spread out,the content became dumb more and more also.
