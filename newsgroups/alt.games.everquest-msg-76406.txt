I'll never understand this.   You're really that concerned about losing 6
percent of the experience for one death?   It never ceases to amaze me, the
level of effort and time that some people will go to to get a 56 rez instead
of a 49 one.  Even in 59, thats only about 3 kills to make up the difference.
By the time you have your 56 rez, me and my 60 paladin friend or 49 - 55
cleric friend will already be about 4 kills ahead of your restored experience
total...
