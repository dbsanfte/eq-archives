I hate camping stuff  but I would like to have my epic and I needed the robe
so.....
To cut a long story short I had to wait for 3 hours to get the camp for the
AM then had to hold it for 16..yes 16 hours before I got the robe. After the
first 5 it became a crusade-I couldnt bear to think THE next pop might be
the one so I sat it out.During that time the AM popped 5 times in total 4
times dropping the Silversilk leggings. This may be about average, or I may
have been very unlucky but what I do know is that
if I knew then what I know now, I would have gone to Seb and just got the
money to buy one at the bazaar and got a little exp at the same time.
My advice to others is don't do this camp-there are easier ways to get the
robe and it is a truly soul destroying experience.
