I was simply responding to a secondary poster, not the original.
Free-flow discussion was all that was intended.

As are most things in life, no argument there.  I'm simply saying that
you've got to have fun as well, because if you're not it really
defeats the purpose of a game such as this.  And it often sounds like
people get stuck in the tedium of raiding and don't really enjoy it,
but just continue with it because they're not sure what else to do.
Kinda like suddenly finding one's self retired after 40 years of
working (or so I'm told).
