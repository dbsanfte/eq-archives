As I understand it:

You will need both the PoS quest and Agnarr to enter the EPs. You can get
to Agnarr just by being level 62+ - as long as you can enter the zone
you only need one member in group with Agnarr key to get to him.

Pretty much the only things you can skip is Aerin`Dar and the HoH trials, if
you piggyback in to kill Mithaniel Marr, and Sol Ro minis if you can get to
Sol Ro. All other intermediary flags are needed for elementals access.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.
