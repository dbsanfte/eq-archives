Yeah, Luclin graphics are on, I had naked models on for a couple days to
demonstrate them to a friend that was in town (he used to have a 33ish bard
but quit EQ when he lost his corpse due to his computer dying about 15
minutes after he died) but turned the nudity off when I got my BP so that I
could see it.

I've got nearly a full suit of Elysian (all solo) and given away the gloves
of suck once to a level 40-something.  Wearing BP, legs and boots, in the
bank I have crown (wearing woven grass) and gloves (wearing coldain skin, or
grey flesh if I need the 10 sv cold).  I don't have elysian arms, but I'm
wearing Gladiator Chain, so I have full chain look except for no helm
graphic (which is how I prefer it unless I have a plate helm, but that's
expensive and/or crappy stats), dark grey (leather) hands (coldain skin/grey
flesh, same tint.) and untinted leather wrists (supple scale/thurg quest)

Personally have VSR, Ulump, Faydedar and the brownie left on my epic... but
I don't see getting much more done with it for a while since I'm guildless,
the Team wants too much for a VSR burn (10k per burner, one burner will do
it for the second stone though, but they won't do it unless they have 3
burners, even though 2 should kill him, particularly after I nuke), though I
should get the brownie done soon if I can get a couple friends to stop being
afraid (59 mage, 54 warrior, and me 55 druid)
