OK, I don't have any expansions except Kunark.  I'm being a human warrior
level 7.  There is not a lot of people my level around so I don't much knwo
what to do...  Where can I go to find some quests or things to do that can
make me money or give me better weapons?  I can't get to the bazaar because
I discovered I don't have the expansion pack and i don't want to buy it.

Thanks for your help.
