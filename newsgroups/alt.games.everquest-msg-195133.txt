Then check out the newbie armor and weapon quests.  Not all races
and classes have them, but many do.  Check out:
http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/quests.htm
towards the bottom of the page are links to write-ups on most (all?)
of the new newbie quests.

Don't be absurd.  There is no right and wrong involved, this isn't a
single player game, you aren't using cheat codes or god modes.  So
long as you aren't gaining in-game advantages for RL considerations
(example:  buying accounts/items/pp on ebay), and you aren't scamming
other players out of their virtual "goods", you aren't cheating and
you aren't wrong.
