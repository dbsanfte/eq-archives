I've seen several enchanter bots, they PL them up to 30 and stop, then 
bring them along outside the group to keep clarity up, and haste if need 
be (although in at least two of those cases, it was a shaman running the 
bot, so it wasn't)

Perhaps one reason for that phenomenum is that they are looking forward 
to a time of plentiful KEI, so they don't want to bother with enchanter 
as a full fledged dual box.
