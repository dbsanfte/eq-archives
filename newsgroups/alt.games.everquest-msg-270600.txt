   Ya, and I'm one of them.  If you do go with the Sims, I might suggest
actually going with Sims 2.  It looks great, and has alot of the features
that were later included in expansion packs of the original Sims.  Things
like having parties, and being able to go to community lots.  Also, the
fact that your sims age and will eventually die adds a whole new dimension
to the game.  You can delay this process by meeting certain "career
aspiration goals" and using the resulting points to by "elixir of Life"
which will make them younger by a few days.  There is a downside that Sims
2 has far few objects than the original Sims + expansion packs, but I have
no doubt that they will come out with new ex packs for Sims 2 as well.

  Another game that Lenny and I like is Sid Meier's Pirates, which was
recently released.  It's an adventure type game, with ship to ship and
sword to sword combat, though it's not what I would call a twitch game.  It
has a decent story line, and really can be quite fun to play.
