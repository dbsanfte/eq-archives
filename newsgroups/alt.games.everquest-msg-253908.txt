I read your post and decided to go out and do this quest.  A part of
it is to get a femur from a grimling skeleton.  I spent over an hour
with my bard and found only 1 grimling skeleton.  So I draged out my
ranger and couldnt find any in another 20 minutes of tracking. I
thought maybe the grimlings might be a PH so I started killing them
and still no skeletons.  Is this quest now broken or is there another
PH for the grimling skeletons?
