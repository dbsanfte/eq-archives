With no drum, the level of your bard doesn't matter, your selos is as 
fast as that of a level 5 bard singing selos, which is to say slower 
than a level 9 shaman's SOW, and I should certainly hope that a level 
20ish mob's SOW would be faster than yours.

Selos isn't actually boosted by your level, but rather by your 
percussion skill plus your instrument bonus if any.  If you PL up to 
(lets say) 10 but don't get any percussion skill, and then run a foot 
race against a real level 10 bard, both using hand drums but her with 
maxed percussion skill, she'll leave you in the dust.  Then race back 
the other way, but both with no drum, and you'll end in a photo finish. 
  This is because without some kind of drum in hand you are counted as 
having a percussion skill of zero

Unless of course, being a real bard, she cheats and jumps her way back 
using jig of vigor to keep her stamina up... leaving you to wonder what 
went wrong with your plan.
