Please note: there is 90 more minutes to LOTR that you will get in the boxed
DVD set.

From what I have "heard" (since it is all rumors) is that Tom Bombadil, the
worry wriaths, the ents, more stuff on Bill the pony etc etc will all be
included.

I would also surmise that it will be the same for the rest of the movies. 3
hours each, with another hour in the DVD set.
