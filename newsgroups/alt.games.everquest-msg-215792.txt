The DE's get a book that's substantially better than any other they
can get for themselves (ignoring bazaar and/or higher level friends)
until they're in their 50s.  Better than all the Cleric, Paladin,
Druid, and Ranger newbie quest gear I've seen combined (i.e. if all
of it were droppable the DE book would sell for more alone than the
total of all the other stuff I've seen).
