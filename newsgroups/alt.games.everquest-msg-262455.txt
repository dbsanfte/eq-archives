EQ2 looks interesting, but I won't be playing it unless I decide that
EQ is no longer worth my while (i.e. enough fun, enough of the time to
satisfy me). I don't do LDoNs though I'd like to start, I don't raid
though I'd like to try a few, and I don't intend to split my time or
spend more money to play EQ2.
