Define "big upgrade". I've messed around with a bit of hardware upgrades
on our systems for EQ, but the one I just built for my wife is the very
first one I saw turn smoothly everywhere but the bazaar. And this
machine is *far* above the minimum or even recommended specs.

Specifically, what's your processor speed, how much and what type RAM,
and equally important, which Video card are you using?
