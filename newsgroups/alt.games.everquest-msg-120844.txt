They were on test last week, and went live in one of yesterday's fifty
patches. ;-)

AFAIK, they must be equipped to have a chance for the effect to take
place. Also, the relative level of caster/item/spell seems to have an
affect on how *often* the focus effect will fire. (This is purely
anecdotal evidence, by the way. I have no way of documenting this yet.) 
But FWIW, I'm wearing a Bracelet of Woven Grass which gives spell haste
I.  I was travelling around quite a bit last night, using the low level
spell gate, and I also cast the level 20 Garrison's Mighty Mana Shock
most fights to finish off a quad. I'm positive that the bracelet's
effect was firing *at least* every other time.  However, one of the
items I have with a level II effect I only noticed firing twice all
evening.
