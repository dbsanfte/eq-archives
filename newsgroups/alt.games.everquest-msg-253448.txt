Retired my pickup finally, bought new in 95, put 215k miles on it, spent 
a grand total of $1590 in repairs (not counting replacing tires, regular 
lube and oil and so on)

Went in to get a new one, to find that this is literally the last year 
they are making my truck.

Old one was an F150 with a V6, 5 speed manual transmission.

After this year, it will be impossible to get an F150 with less than a 
V8, and impossible to get one without an automatic transmission.

Now besides the fact that I prefer the control and just the feel of 
driving manual, my impression is that a manual transmission is more fuel 
efficient.  A V6 is certainly more efficient than a V8.

I need an F150's load capacity and truck bed space, if I didn't need it, 
I'd buy something smaller, if I didn't need a pickup I'd get an economy 
car.  Fact is, I have to have a real truck to make my business work 
(making swords and selling them at renaissance festivals across the 
country).  I don't, however, need any more power than that trusty V6 
gives me, I've driven the old one for 9 years and like I said, 215 
thousand miles, and I can think of three occaisions where a heavy load 
and very steep grade meant having to shift down out of fourth, most of 
the time I'd be passing other vehicles on an up grade even loaded down.

Given that oil is a limited resource (sure, we may have 20 or even 50 
more years worth at our current consumption rate, which is a big shock 
to the people in the 70s who said we'd be out by the 90s, but its still 
limited), and given that half our current geopolitical dilemnas are 
currently driven by some people that produce what, 15% of the oil we 
currently need, why are we obsessed with bigger engines and automatic 
transmissions?

If you Need a V8 (say for example, to haul a trailer around) then I have 
no problem with you buying one.  But it seems to me that most people 
don't need the bigger engine, its just something they want.  I'm shocked 
to find that so few people are asking for the smaller engine that its 
been phased out.

I'm prepared to be shown wrong about the transmission angle, I know back 
in the 70s it was very clearly more fuel efficient to drive a stick, but 
I haven't looked into it in years.  Still, I thought this was a car 
oriented nation, I can't imagine that there are so few people who value 
the simplicity of automatic over the added control of manual that manual 
is no longer a viable option.  Worse, there's a direct contradiction, to 
me, in wanting more power (v8) and less control (automatic).  I mean, if 
you don't care about your ride, then why bother with the V8 you'll never 
use?  If you do, why throw away most of your gains by accepting an 
automatic tranny?

Maybe thats it really, at the heart of it, people are lazy enough not to 
care to learn or use a stick, and so for the same effectiveness they 
need the bigger more gas guzzling engine.

Just like people think they need KEI to play EQ, when they could do fine 
using mod rods and sitting down... which would be more work!  (and you 
thought this was all going to be OT)
