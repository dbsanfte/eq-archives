Where it falls down is that none of this 'stuff'
belongs to anyone. Also, theft is illegal, what
this guy did isn't.

Yes, but how long should you keep at it?  Where is
the dividing line between when you are a 'thief',
and when you are the new owner?

I don't see the difference... how do you know it
wasn't kept in a library book for safekeeping?

I agree with you mostly, but the whole thing
sounds strange. All this stuff dropped in the
Bazaar, and no-one around saying... "Hey that's
mine..."
