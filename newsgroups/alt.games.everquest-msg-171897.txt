This is a copy of something I posted on EQTraders.  Thought I'd ask for help
from y'all as well.

I just started taking orders for Heraldic armor. Now I know why I wanted to
become a GM smith! The potential to make a fistful of plat is enormous -
I've already made 50K, and I have an order in the pipeline that will net me
150K more. Like, wow. I've never had more than 50K before.

However, I'm running smack-dab into a huge roadblock: Essences of Sunlight.
I try to buy these in the bazaar, but if I'm lucky I'll find one or two for
sale every other day. Clearly I need many, many more. I've tried the
following things:

I've wandered North Ro, South Ro, and the Oasis trying to find Sand Giants
to kill. I only see one up very rarely, and even then it doesn't always drop
an Essence. I've tried merchant mining in those areas, to no avail. I've
seen the tale of Fansy the Famous Bard, and how he was able to create trains
of six or seven Sand Giants. How did he do it? How do you get more than one
Sand Giant to spawn? Are there specific placeholders I can kill to get them
to spawn? Mostly, getting essences from these areas has turned out to be a
big bust.

Faerie Dragons in Wakening Lands. I can solo these - not quickly, I'm just a
cleric, and all my buffs get dispelled. I can manage maybe ten an hour. And
only about one in ten seems to drop an essence of sunlight. It would take me
many, many hours here to get some essences, which makes me shudder to think
about it, although I'm still perfectly willing to continue to try. It's been
my most reliable source so far, despite the fact that it's netted me a grand
total of three essences so far.

I certainly can't solo in Skyfire, although once I sat there for ten minutes
and auctioned that I would buy everyone's Essences for a good price. I got
no responses, and I then had to leave to attend a guild raid. But I noticed
about 20 folks in the zone, which made me think it could possibly be a good
source of essences, if I can just manage to stay for a little while longer.

Any other thoughts? When you need a few Essences of Sunlight, what's your
strategy?

Thanks. =)
