15 to 20 I fought in Oasis, soloing whatever crocs were doable for me.
Around 20 I found South Karanas, and spent my next 9 levels grouping Tesch
Mas Gnolls.  I got stuck in a wall in lair of the splitpaw (accessed in SK)
but even without the dungeon bonus, I still managed to ding every day
outside on the spires playing with a good, steady pulling group.  Just make
sure everyone in the group is near your level so the exp isn't sucked away.
At 29 I split between the basement in HH and Mistmoore.

Go and buy all your songs in Kelwithe as soon as you can after 24, because
the songs from 24-29 are only found in Kelwithe and they are some of the
best so far.  That way, you don't have to level, make a trip all the way
there, come back and level again.  Keep em in the bank and go grab em as
needed.  Consonant chain was very nice in keeping the TM Gnolls from running
away and aggroing others on you.
