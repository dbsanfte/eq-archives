On Inny, I found it fairly easy to find groups when I had to. 
Although... the first of the named mobs despawned as the last of the 
group was on the way. (He needed it too)  Then, after the mindless 
boredom (we were somewhat impatient) of waiting for him to respawn, we 
started making trains of greys. That cured our boredom, so we did bigger 
and bigger trains. Of course, thats when Towyn popped. So I am 
suggesting patience throughout the quest, hehe.
