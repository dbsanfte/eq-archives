I don't use Winamp (anymore). It's just Joe said he used to have them
working but now he needs to rename them to .mid. According to the file
extension list, .xmi should be readable by Winamp.

BTW, I don't have any problems with Winamp, I'm just to lazy to redownload
it since I reformatted my hardrive.
