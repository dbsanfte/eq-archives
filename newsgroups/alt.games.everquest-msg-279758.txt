At the lower levels, which will last quite a while with that play schedule,
you'll be fine.  It's only when you get to level 60+ where you might face
some difficulties.

If you plan ahead and plan on always having such a play schedule you can
pick a solo capable class to ease any difficulties.  Druid would seem like a
good choice for you, with tremendous solo ability and still highly
desirable for groups (two far different playstyles between the soloing and
grouping druid, though).  Necromancer is another popular solo capable
choice.  There are other solo capable classes, but unlike the druid and
necro they don't come with an "easy" setting (figuratively speaking) so
probably wouldn't be good for a true newbie.

All classes can solo at lower levels, so don't be afraid to start up one of
each and try them all out to form your own opinions.

As far as group demand, shamans, enchanters, and clerics all get groups with
comparative ease.  They *can* solo, but none are particularly good at it, so
that's the tradeoff.

Honestly, and don't let this deter you from EQ as I myself consider it the
best of the online game options available right now, WoW and Guild Wars both
offer a more time-challenged-friendly environment, and both are good games. 
You might do some reading on those and see whether they would be worth a
try.
