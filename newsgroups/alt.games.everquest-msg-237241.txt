I think you're so used to the Christian definition of God that you're
having trouble debating any viewpoint other than anti-Christian.  I'm
not a Christian but I believe in God.  I don't believe in Hell and don't
even necessarily believe in a punishment phase after death, so the whole
issue of moral authority is moot.

And I've already discussed God giving us free will in another post and
how that gift is valuable precisely because he's purposefully given up
being all knowing as a result.  I'm not saying I definately believe in
that (I'm permanently confused - boy am I making myself vulnerable by
saying that!), but it seems reasonable.

I only do it because I think of "God" like I think of "Joe" or "Bob"
or "Dennis".  It kind of sort of feels like a name to me, so I tend
to capitalize the first letter.
