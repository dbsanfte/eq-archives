Yep, and it's been addressed by Sony.

Yup, and they've addressed the issue for most PoP content.

But the progression through those zones is the whole point, the aim. 
Not beating Blazzax in Fire.  Beating Blazzax in Fire is the *reward* 
for succeeding at beating the previous content.  Beating the content is 
the challenge.  Those zones are locked for that reason.

 From PoP onwards zones have been locked to provide progressive raiding 
and in 90% of the cases, the locked zones are raid zones with offer very 
little for the non-raider.
