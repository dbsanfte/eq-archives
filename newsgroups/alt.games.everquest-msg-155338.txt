This is where it gets confusing. Antonius Bayle and Kane Bayle are Verant
servers located in Europe. The "new" UbiSoft servers are something
different; there will be three (English, French, German) and they will
require DIFFERENT SOFTWARE and ACCOUNTS. So a Verant account will let you
play on, say, Karana, Povar and Antonius Bayle, but not "UbiEnglish",
"UbiFrench" or "UbiGerman"; a UbiSoft account will leit you play on
"UbiEnglish", "UbiFrench" or "UbiGerman" (though you need different software
for the French and German servers) but will NOT let you play on Antonius
Bayle, Povar, Karana or any of the outher Verant servers.

So if you want to play on both Verant and UbiSoft servers you will need two
accounts and two separate installs of Everquest PER MACHINE.
