Have level use restrictions on equipment would handle it quite well.  And,
to me, makes sense.  However, as in RL, twinking is a fact of life.  I just
remember that when I am driving my Neon and some pretentious 18 year old
goes whizzing by in their Mercedes convertible.  I just remember that I
earned what I have on my own.  (God, I wish I had that Mercedes).
