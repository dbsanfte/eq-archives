Stop by my guild some time. There's a whole *basement* of "further from
uber" for you to browse. :-)  Including our sixties. he he.

Oh yeah, we had adds. The ADDS had adds. That place is a freaking
nightmare. Even in the "easy" parts. I believe I recall *briefly* seeing
seven mobs at one point. I say "briefly" because my first cast on one
got the attention of some of the others for some reason. Man, I gotta
get me some plate mail that's wizzy usable.

Hrmm. I'll have to check, but our MA is 59 now. He recently posted some
gear questions on our boards, and I seem to recall him saying he had an
unbuffed HP in the high 4K range. Not positive though. As to the pulls..
see above. Adds on the adds. It's like they all had cell phones.

Yep, and that's probably what I wasn't taking into account when
originally pondering this. I'm on Xev, if I didn't mention it before,
and Xev is kind of weird. We're a split server too, (damned if I can
recall which one we split from on one cup of coffee, but it was before I
came over from Saryn to start over.) Xev just evolved "weird", I think.
One guild became the dominant guild. But having no competition, they
seemed to just not grow like the big guilds did on older servers. I
think there was nothing to push them, so they never felt pressed to keep
going after the bigger and bigger stuff. Example: AoW and Tunare only
went down for the first time on Xev this spring. Plus, they kept blowing
up and splitting after getting to a certain point, (or so I gather from
talking to folks who've been around longer than me) so I guess that
slowed down the evolutionary process as well.

There's a couple really capable guilds coming up behind them, but while
they are most all 60's with some AA and decent gear, they don't have the
numbers to tackle the *really* big stuff. (One of them wiped badly to
Dain Wed. night while we were in there pulling dorfs near the entry.)
Just recently, two of the biggest tier two guilds combined into one. But
at this point it looks like they are still sorting out the power
structure, strategies, etc. and can't do much but zerg yet. But given
time, they'll probably give our top dog guild <Legends of Harmonium> a
run for their money.

Yeah, I guess I could see that. You'll probably have a lot more prexians
hitting that former cap than you will see Xevites doing it any time
soon.

Again, I see your point. On your server, certainly not. And the
definition of Uber obviously changes drastically from server to server.
I've often felt that if you took our top dog guild and suddenly dropped
them on Prexus, or Inny, or Stormhammer, or Zeb, etc. they would get
eaten alive. So the non-uber on my server are probably far less likely
to see that gear than some of the non-uber on Prexus, simply because the
bar is so much higher there.

Live and learn. :-)
