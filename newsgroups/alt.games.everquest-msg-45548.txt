You need to have your eyes checked. Point out to me where I ever
compared IE 6 with Netscape 4.7. When I had the problem, IE 5 was the
latest version. And also point out where I said Mozilla sucked. I
simply asked, 'Why should I use it when the tool that I have does
everything I want?' I could go out and buy a $4000 computer too, but
why should I when my current one suits my needs just fine?

I never said it was worse than IE, nor did  I put it down in any way.
I simply said, 'Why should I bother?'

And I shoud care why? They all do the same thing, basically: surf the
web. Tell me why I should I replace a product I'm perfectly happy with
and risk corrupting my system just so I can do the same thing I'm
doing now with IE? Because Microsoft is the Great Satan? Please.
