This is a big peeve of mine, "matching FICA".  I have about 50 employees 
at peak season, and pay self employment tax on my own income.

I forget the precise numbers, but here's the general idea:  an employee 
who makes $100 gets $7.50 taken out of his pay and I contribute a 
"matching" $7.50.

When I make $107.50, I pay $15 in FICA.

My wife, who does all the tax work for the family and for my business 
(and gets a stipend for the latter), yells about us having to pay more 
FICA than our employees do, and about us matching their payment.

I look at this differently; if I pay myself $107.50 I have to cut the 
government in for $15 of it so my take home is $92.50.  If I pay an 
employee $100, he also goes home with $92.50, and I as employer am out 
$107.50, and the government ends up with $15.

As I'm not insane, when I offer an employee a job for which I can afford 
to part with $107.50, I tell him its for $100 in pay; knowing that it 
will cost me the $107.50 in total.

The whole "matching FICA" thing is just a stupid shell game which lies 
to the american employees about how much they are paying in tax; they, 
like me, are paying nearly 15% of their income in to the FICA fund, in 
terms of what their employees are parting with in order to employ them.
