Probably don't even need that much.  I can bet that if you
still remember the station name and password you could load the
program and connect to the servers for updates.

Then, when you finish, sign in with the name/password and get
told that your subscription has expired.  Re-subscribe, and
go to playing!

Good luck, and while Luclin is fun, PoP is a GREAT expansion
simply for the PoK books, even if you never get a single
character above 25, and LoY is great if you need the extra
bank slots.
