""Due to some strange bug Everquest crashes on me whenever I want to change
 the resolution in-game. Is there a way to set it manually outside the game?

I use a program called EQu. It is very handy, you can use it change screen
res, text colors, and a host of other things.
(including setting your characters to start running, instead of clicking
"run" each time you start.

The prog is free, small, and a lot safer than trying to edit the
eqclient.ini file yourself.

BTW, I am what's known as a lurker. I am a faithful reader of this
newsgroup, but rarely post. I might change that tho, as my knowledge of EQ
increases.
