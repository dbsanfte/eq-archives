Interestingly enough, I played my only ShadowKnight character in much the
same way....  A confused young man from Paineel who all he ever knew while
growing up was the culture of fear and domination.  Then he met some Good
characters who were actually kind toward him while adventuring in the
Warrens.  These repeated acts of kindness gave him hope, which was against
his religion.  Last I left him, he was struggling with the conflicting
ideals of good vs. evil.

And that was just a mule I created for exploring the Warrens :-).
