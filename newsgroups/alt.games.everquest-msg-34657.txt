Yes, that was my favorite spot as a druid from like 50 or so on.
Just a lil south of that fortress, along the west wall of the canyon,
you encounter no sarnaks or anything in kind of a large "mob dead"
area. This makes it VERY safe to go to the south west a bit, grab a
thing and pull it up there a ways to where you will be totally
unmolested in your killing. After its dead you can med very safely
also. My druid found plenty of undead gorillas, live ones, giants,
wurms, etc to pull up.

The giant fort is also a semi prime area for for that naughty
summoning gorilla to be, not good if alone. Soloing there is often too
hard anyway since many players can be there. As you say that NE corner
is sort of best, when my druid was pulling from the south to the
fairly safe wall it was totally free of other player intervention
though many were in the zone. No one really ever kills stuff at the
sarnak fort even so you can do that if bored.. I found I could invis
past some, then pull and kite them in an area of that courtyard but
out of aggro range of another.
