You should consider taking up the baking skill. My lev 25 wood-elf ranger
forages stuff up all the time, mostly roots, veg, rabbit and water. I end up
throwing a lot of the stuff away because I forage faster than I eat/drink
and foraged items are quite heavy. But if you having the baking skill, you
can cook the foraged stuff into something much lighter (wt 0.1 each) and if
your skill is high enough you can make hearty meals and banquets. One fish
and one bat wing gives you a fish roll banquet, if your skill is high
enough.

Have a look at http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_baking.htm for some
recipes.
