I find Flash of Light quite helpful as a beastlord. Not sure whether it's
as useful to a paladin. Maybe you could team up with a snarer and fear
kite with it...

Lately I've been fighting in zones where adds make FoL not terribly useful
as a crowd control spell (tae ew in Feerrott, gnolls in Splitpaw, giant
fort in Warsliks Woods). But it was wonderful while soloing for splitting
spawns in other zones (orc camps in South Ro, lizards in Rathe Mts, aviaks
in Lake Rathetear). Flash one mob, flash a second before the other 2
close, and you're left fighting only one mob. When flash wears off after
12 seconds, you have 12 seconds of grace as they run back. Back out of
melee, recast FoL, reenter melee. When you've finished with the first mob,
let Flash lapse on one. Lather, rinse, repeat. Presto, you've just broken
a 3-mob spawn! The only tricky part is that FoL generates so much taunt
that warder often won't be able to peel those other mobs off you. Know your
limits, know if the flashed mobs will bring adds, be sure to reflash
*before* they get back into melee range, and have a backup plan for when
they resist it.

I've had less success with FoL in groups. Most groups have better methods
of crowd control available. And I've had problems with using it purely for
its taunt effects, as an aggro management tool. It's not always clear who's
at the top of the hate list. If none of those in melee range are, then
that Tesch Mal just makes a beeline for his buddies down the hall. Train
to zone!
