Well now, here's a good reason nobody else might have posted.  It hasn't 
happened yet. *g*  Tonight I was fighting in HHK when the messages came 
up.  I demanded that *somebody* from our guild go check it out *g*, as 
I'd never make it, but only our guild leader decided to go, and she 
unfortunately was in Lower Guk when she started out, so she got there 
after it was all over :(  I don't remember you mentioning this message:

[Sun Jul 28 17:38:27 2002] <SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE>: Tyranadin : Strange 
events are occurring across Norrath! The protectors of Jaggedpine defend 
Surefall Glade against advancing Gnolls. The howling of wolves are heard 
in plains and mountains. Across the world events like these are waiting 
to be discovered

And, we had a guild member in LOIO at the time who was apparently one of 
many who discovered a new mob called a "deathwing drake".  She got 
wasted by one while she was AFK, then came back to get her body and got 
wasted by three more, including a caster.  Later on she said she 
couldn't get any spells to stick, so she logged on her husband's 50-
something-with-epic shaman and he couldn't get any spells to stick 
either.  Last I heard from her was that they were around the windmill 
killing people even in the 50s.  The only info I can find on the 
deathwings so far is a couple mentions on the allakhazam/bestiary 
message board for the LOIO zone - apparently there's been some NPC 
wandering around telling people about them.

Ryou
