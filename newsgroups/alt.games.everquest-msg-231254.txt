Veksar will be the place that you can DING 65 as a necro pretty fast.  95%
of the mobs are undead.  You will not fear kite there.  the undead has very
narrow agro range so you seldom get add.  Just send pet, slow, dot, dd then
you are done.  It has great loot too.  For the weapons that you loot from
the mobs in Veksar, you can do a quest in loio by turning in 4 same weaps at
a time, it will give you very good xp even at 60.  However, I have passed
all of the weap I got to my alt druid while I leveling from 60 to 65.  My
druid was 35, and now is 44, by just doing that quest.  Also the undead is a
good dire charm pet.  When you got that, you'll definitely give up your lvl
65 pet.  It has 7k hp and hit for 125 for at lvl 46.
