I wasn't aware the game of everQUEST was about the 'fun' of shopping.

Changes like this simply ensure the playuers actually do the quests, 
which is after all the point of the game. No more sittitng there 
thinking "That's a pretty interestng quest... but I can just buy some 
ubers hand me down for a couple gold."

If you want to play a game where the fun and interest is related to 
buying and selling in the market we have several outlets for you:

ebay
day trading

Oh the horror.

Beats having them grind away gold to buy the hand me downs instead of 
doing the quests themselves.

Seriously, ask yourself, are you really going to have -less- fun because 
you'll have to perform a quest to get an item? Were you really having 
that much fun buying your stuff?
