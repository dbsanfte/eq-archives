What are you trying to show here?  That because a swear word might be a
synonym for a milder word that all synonyms are swear words?  One case
doesn't prove for all.

I've never heard "motherfucker" used to describe a case of incest.  I have
heard it used toward both men and women.

yeah, yeah so you're saying "pussy" can never be used without sexual
reference - rubbish.  The most glaring example is the number one definition
in the dictionaries - cat.

It's that I simply do not chose to jump on the PC bandwagon when someone
decides a word now must always have sexist meanings.  Pussy for wimp is not
the same as pussy for vagina.

yes so wake up, the context of pussy was for a coward.  As such there was no
sexual reference.

Provide citations if you think otherwise.

One person was able to provide a citation.  That by an author with no
credentials and it being to a magazine which is a niche magazine with a bias
and hardly an authority.  The article was shown to have errors.

Evidence contrary to your point goes back many centuries.  If you want to
find dirt in what people say and wish to always look for innuendo, you will
find it regardless if that was the person's intent or if it is even their in
reality.

rubbish.

"you pussy" to mean wimp has no sexual connotations , and who;d ever call a
person a pussy meaning they were a "cunt", they have quite different
meanings.

I haven't argued whether Blizzard are within their rights or not, so only a
fool would accuse me of being thick headed in that regard.  I did say what I
thought the case should be, it's in this thread.  And I took the time to
check with a GM.  Turns out what I thought was the case was indeed Blizz's
stance - at least as far as the GM understood it.  Go ask for yourself.
