Because only wis casters get heal spells. At lvl 20 you get a damage absorb
spell which is sort of like healing.

And the pet gets killed immediately.  How do I

Between you and you pet you should be able to take down a DB con to you in
CB. Let the pet attk till its nearly a gonna then step in and let it hit
you. Mobs will always attk PC over pets if your in attk range. melee it and
chain nuke it. If it looks bad, mez/root it and then you can run if you need
to. Root it and stp back again , the pet may have regened some hp by then,
they do regen quite fast. And always make sure you have your latest pet.. so
that would be the lvl 12 one. Using an old lvl 4 pet or something is not
gonna do much good.

You could always try charm soloing at lvl 12 tho that would be difficult and
suicidal without sow, unless near a zone line for quick escape.
