Norrath is a collection of computer instructions resulting in colored pixels
bouncing off a light sensitive screen on my monitor. Russia is real.
If your talking about the RL economy of EQ, through ebay and such that's a
different story. Doubt that that part of the economy is equal to Russia.
Why do scientists spend so much time studying the inane, for example, I read
that a group of professors spend years trying fathom the reason that toast
always falls butter side down.
It's not as though there are any important things to study, such as a cure
for cancer, or anything.
