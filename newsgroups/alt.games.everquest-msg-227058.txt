If its no-drop then he *should* get it if he wants it for no rp at 
all... whats the alternative? Let it rot? Making him cough up 10rp for 
something nobody else wants in the slightest is just silly.

If its not no-drop... then I have a couple questions:

1) For only 1rp I would assume even the warriors might be tempted to bid 
on it as bazaar fodder, or for an alt. If its that good it won't go for 
1rp. Or is that not allowed. I'm personally split on what is more 
fair... on some level it hurts the guild if a rich warrior is twinking 
up his alt at the expense of other guildies... then again... why should 
the warrior show up at all the raids, and earn a pile of rp, if he's not 
allowed to spend them without the 'officers approval'.

2) What about magicians that aren't on the raid? If I attend 100 raids 
trying to get item X, and miss the raid where it drops, perhaps I should 
have an opportunity to bid on it too?

If you only allow the people at the raid to qualify for an item, you 
might have some people looking at the raid composition hoping there 
aren't any richer mages along tonight. This could even be manipulated by 
raid organizers to a point... I'll schedule the raid on the night 
Braxxus the super rp rich Shaman won't be along so my GF will win the 
breastplate they both want if it drops...

At which point you might as well just value everything at 1. The item 
values still seem pointless and artificial to me.
