Aye and I've got a female dark elf cleric named Veragemini Quicklimegirl. These are taken from 2
Blue Oyster Cult songs. 
My paladin (High Elf) is Named Loleneai Foehammer
My Mage (human) is named Aareian Dancemacbr (wouldn't let me add the 'e' to the end.) Surname comes
from a piece of music by Sant-Saens.
My Shaman (froggie) is named Taddles Ghostdancer
I have a rogue who is named Gitchie and when he gets to lvl 20 I'm asking for gumee as the surname.
Its the indian name for lake superior.

So my naming is rather scattered and I try to see if any one can pick up the references. So far only
one perosn has mentioned that Foehammer is the common name for the sword  Orcrist.
None of the others have garnered a comment or /petiton. Guees they are too obscure so far.
