   Misery does love company.  I find it oddly comforting that
this hasn't happened only to me.

    The nice thing about being stuck under the world is that I
was actually happy for once to find that the server had come
down.  

   I logged on, and yeah!  for the first time in 3 days was able
to get to the character select screen.  I was still in Beholder,
and I figured under the world, so I let myself spin for 20
minutes before logging on, hoping I would come up in my bind spot
in the PoK.  

   Well,  I didn't come up in the PoK, but I didn't come up under
the world either.  I was uncomfortable close to the middle eye. 
I ran for the zone and made it without getting charmed again.    

  Many thanks to all who gave me moral support during this trying
time.  Now that I have been released from prison, I will cherish
my freedom and try to make a good example of my self as I
re-intergrate with society.

Annie
