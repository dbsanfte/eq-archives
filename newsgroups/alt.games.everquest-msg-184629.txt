Once you're out of the newbie levels, a single one handed weapon falls way
behind in damage, compared to the two handers that will be available to a
paladin.  Even the special paladin only onehanders won't keep up.  At the
current endgame, there are almost no paladins not using either 2 hand slash,
blunt or piercing.   A paladin who has only used 1 handed weapons would be
crippled at those levels, until he put a *lot* of effort into catching up.

Verant has claimed that they are planning on revamping shield combat, to
make using a 1 handed weapon and a shield a  viable combo, but they have not
made any changes yet.

Keep your bash skill high, since it is a good way of interrupting spells,
but past level 20, the two handed weapon choices will be doing more damage
than the one handed choices generally available to you.
