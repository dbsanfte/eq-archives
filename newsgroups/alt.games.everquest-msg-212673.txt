A while back a poster asked Richard if he could post
a html link of his stories.  Richard agreed and we all
went to this link of Monual's stories.  What we found
was all the stories were all together in one gigantic html
file (that was probably made though word and so was
about 5 times larger than it needed to be). I thought this
was a fantastic idea and it was cool  because I was able
to read some of Richards earlier stuff (having not really
been following it before).

Well, I visited the link and the page is still there, but it
hasn't been updated with stories since it was posted.
I also found out it was missing some of Richard's earlier
work too.
So, I decided to make my own Monual's Adventures page.
(I've also included stories from Richard about his Paladin
and also from John Gordon's Ryssa). I'd like to apologize
in advance that this is on a Geocities site.

I always welcome feedback!  If anyone has a site they'd
like to donate to host this on please let me know (it can
be transferred easily).
Also let me know if you'd like to donate some artwork for
the site or if you have a favorite AGE writer that you'd like
added to the site (this includes yourself) or if I missed a
Monual story.  (I did skip a couple of the ones that had no
relevant story information)
