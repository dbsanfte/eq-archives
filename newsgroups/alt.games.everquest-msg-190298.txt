It happened to me once, until I noticed there was a space before the 
first letter right after the "<" , so I tried to type /who all " 
nameofguild" with the space before the first letter, and it worked. I'm 
not saying it's the solution in your case but you can try to check.
Also, is the name special? With an apostrophe for example? In some case 
it can be the problem, well at least it was for me with one guild.
