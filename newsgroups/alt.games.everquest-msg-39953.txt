I was in AO beta4 and everyone exploited this level lock.  Level and if you
want to go back to your bind point, get yourself killed and *pop* you're
back.  However, that's a minor exploit.

A better exploit is how you play the game.  In AO, there was a time when you
went for loot and a time you went for level.  When you ding at a new level,
you then take all the hardest missions for the best loot they will offer.
So you die.  Big deal.  You made sure your bind point is near the mission
entrance.  You get killed, you go back in, and keep doing it until you get
the loot you want.  Eventually after all the deaths, you know exactly where
the loot is and head right for it.  Oh, you also always go for the loot
instead of zone to save your hide.  One, you don't lose hide and, two, if
you get "accomplish the mission" (touch the loot) and die, you get to keep
the loot ... so you can have a train on you for certain death but you don't
care as long as you get the "mission accomplished" message before you're
killed.  Once you've gotten what you can get for your level (AO is very
level restrictive for gear  ... by the restriction of "skill points" needed
wear use higher and higher gear), you then take on easy mobs for XP.  In
group or solo.  It doesn't matter.  You keep leveling until you qualify for
a new round of gear then go for loot again.  Rinse and repeat.

What a group of us beta4ers did was basically find out who liked going for
loot (like being a sneaky thief) and who like fighting.  Looters would then
log on and group with the fighters.  The looters would do nothing.  Simply
sit their character in a safe spot and leave to do something else in real
life.  The fighters would just have their fun killing monsters and
harvesting XP for the group.  The Looters would be told to come back to
their computers to check on things once in a while ... say during television
commercial breaks ... and see how the fighters were doing.  Usually Looters
expected at least one level before they go off looting for the group.
They'd then solo the loot missions.  They have shopping lists even.  They'd
camp the mission centrals and click through there endlessly looking for
things on their list.  They'd then get the stuff on their list.  Equipping
themselves and the fighters.  The really good Looter/XPer groups would have
the Looters on one side of the globe and the XPers on the other.  While the
XPers slept, the Looters got equipment.  While the Looters slept, the XPers
got everyone XP.  It was a great set-up.

However, I didn't buy AO simply because it was too buggy at that time (still
is from what I hear) and it was and still is simply a futuristic version of
EQ.
