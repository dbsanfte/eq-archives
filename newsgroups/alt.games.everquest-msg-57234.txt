If this were true, rogues wouldn't even need evade.  Ragebringer is delay
25, offhanders are all over the map, but mostly high 20s once you've solved
the "How do I ditch this locustlure?" problem.  Backstab is delay 100.  I
suppose the haste from Ragebringer helps some, most tanks have worse, but
that's still not enough to make a 100 delay "weapon" so dependable a taunt.

Fast weapons help, but it's not nearly so black and white as you're
implying.
