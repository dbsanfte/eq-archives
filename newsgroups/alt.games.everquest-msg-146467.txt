I'll keep this short here, email me at SullenWhisper01@aol.com or
rogueincie1@yahoo.com for a full item list and to talk price/payment/pickup.

Luclin Cleric Gear: some plat, and items for every slot, with enough +wis gear
to get a High Elf cleric who maxes wisdom at creation to 208 wisdom, WITHOUT
using +wis items in the chest, legs, arms, and feet so there's some room for
customization here to make your cleric even strong than mine is. 

7th Hammer Rogue Gear: not every slot, more plat than the cleric has (around
2k), 5 pieces of ravenscale along with 2 uncommon weapons and some other
things.

email for a full list of items and their stats, along with the exact number of
plat and details about price and pickup.
