Yeah, I guess it is.  Everybody's got a story...
My wizard partner and I were doing spiders the other day in Crystal Cavern.  A
high level guy asks if he can have the queen, we say sure, too hard for us
anyway.  He runs down the hall.  We share the camp. No problem.  Never saw him
again til he came out to leave. Waved goodbye and bowed.  Great guy.  My
partner translocated him to Fay.   Yesterday, same scenario.  Only this guy is
a lower level monk and he brings a group.  A few minutes later they come
running back out with a train, no warning, they all got killed except the monk,
got me killed, killed a couple guys doing the geos next door too.  My partner
was able to gate out.   
20 minutes later, same thing.  Only this time the rest of us were prepared and
they weren't able to scrape their trash off on us.   
Thank GOD they didn't try it a third time.
Sharing a camp is not always the best idea...
