Well, our Monk is gone for a week, but we decided to head to CoM, anyway.  
Our Shaman has a level 30 Monk friend who wanted to play, and as he's 
fairly twinked ( and a good player ), he met us there and we had our full 
party : 41 WAR, 41 WAR, 42 CLC, 42 BRD, 30 MNK, 36 SHM.

I didn't know this, but the other warrior's 55 mage had hunted in CoM 
before, so he knew the ins and outs.

We get there and immediately get rez requests from the French group that 
was in there.  I had a sinking feeling that this was going to happen all 
night, and our Cleric is nice enough that she would -never- deny a Rez 
request.  She rezzes, we buff up and head it after medding.  A chanter from 
the French group comes out and Clarities our 2 casters - very nice.

We get in and their group is sitting at the zone line, recovering from the 
Rezzes.  We head in and through the gate and go to the left and park 
ourselves.  We fought there for a bit having trouble getting single pulls 
even wen we switched to the Monk FD pulling.  No problem though, we have 
our act together and can handle 4-5 mobs at once if need be, even though it 
takes us OOM.

Although the mobs were mostly blue ( with some whites and yellows thrown in 
), I could definitely feel the difference in the damage they were doing.  I 
got hit for over 100 for the first time during a normal melee.  Ow.

The French group hung out on the right side across from us for a while, 
calling in higher level "guards" from their Guild to watch over them.  They 
left after about and hour or hour and a half.  At that point, we moved back 
in closer to the zone, but still in the "open" area.

We dropped beasts there for a while, until 2 of us had to go AFL for 5 
minutes, so we headed to the Zone line for safety's sake.

Many many mobs died last night, and we only had 2 close calls - when the 
monk was pulling, he dropped to 1 bub of health once, and our Bard almost 
bit it during a loooonnnnng battle we had.  He didn't see the CLC give the 
OOM message and had 3 on him that he was trying to get under control.  He 
hit the zone line with enough HPs to not get tossed to the safe spot, but 
he was pretty much "mostly dead".  That was the only time someone had to 
zone.

The Shammy got all his no-drop notes / messages / letters / etc except for 
the one from the Courier or something.  I know -I- sure got tired of 
destroying the extras over and over and over again.

We did make out pretty good on the loot.  About 48 plat each in coins, even 
though I destroyed over 1k of each silver and copper.  We also got some 
Jade rings, a pearl earring, 3 opals, and the following weapons:

Green Jade Broadsword - 11/25 8Str 8Sta 10svp 10svd 1.2Wt | RNG, PAL, WAR
Kunzar Ku'juch - 8/22 2.00 Wt | WAR | Procs Engulfing Darkness at 40
Wraith Bone Hammer - 8/26 5Str 2Wis 2Int 7.30Wt | Most Classes   

The Clc got the Hammer ( Shammy still wants one, and I"m sure we'll get 
more with the drop rate I read on them ), and the other War and I will 
share the GJB for now.  Both of us have 2 better slashers, so we may try to 
trade it for something we need.  Not sure what we will do with the Kunzar, 
as we don't deal with runners in there ( yet ).  Probably keep it for when 
we need that darkness proc.

It was a great night, and we're all looking forward to tonight.  The Bard 
dinged 43, the other Warrior hit 42, and the Monk hit 31.  I got 3 yellows. 
so am now 1.5 short of 42.

Thanks for all the info you guys provided.  Although Ughhies knew it 
already, I didn't, and knowing my batle-zone is very important to me.
