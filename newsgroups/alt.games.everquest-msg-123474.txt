I have no hard facts to back up the assertions I'm about to make.  I
do a lot of trade skills on different characters, and this is what
I've noticed from casual observastion.

The higher you get you int OR wis, the faster the skill ups will
become.  The caveat is, if you manage to get 255, it *seems* to
actually slow down skill ups.  When I tradeskill, I try to get an even
number between 240 and 254.   I read a study done once that suggested
maybe the EQ random number generator chokes on prime numbers.  Won't
swear it's true, but I seem go get faster skill ups with an even
number in the appropriate stat.

Last night I finally decided to try to get Jewelcraft to 250.  When I
started working with gold, I expected to lose money.  I was using a
tinkered +% skill mod thingy, and had very few failures.  I was
actually turning a profit around the 180 skill range with 246 int.
