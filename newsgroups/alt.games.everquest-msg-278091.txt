Which one?  NetBackup, which is the one I support, is actually a pretty 
robust backup solution *if* you configure it and your environment correctly. 
The devil is in the details, as they say, but once you get everything done 
right, NetBackup will perform handstands on demand.

Now, if you're talking Backup Exec, then yeah, it's cheap off-the-shelf 
software for a reason.  =/
