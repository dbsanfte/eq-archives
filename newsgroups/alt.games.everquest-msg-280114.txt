Totally not a direct answer to your question but perhaps an indirect
one.

A group of us have started playing together one night a week and we
made a group that is completely incapable of higher level content, but
we're all playing something we want to play for fun.
The last 2 weeks we've been in Estate of Unrest and we're having a
great time.  I mean the most fun I've had playing EQ, ever.

Point being is it's not really the content you can get to but who
you're playing with.  I've always understood EQ was a social game, and
that's what I loved about it, but I never understood just how great it
could be if you had the right group.  Previously I'd had what I
thought were great groups, and from a purely 'everyone knows what
they're doing and we're chewing through mobs' I have.  But for just
plain ol fun?  Nope, apparently not.

For those who will ask:

gnome SK
troll Beserker
ogre Warrior
dwarf Paladin
wood elf Ranger
half elf Bard

Long live Gob's of O (Offense)!!!
