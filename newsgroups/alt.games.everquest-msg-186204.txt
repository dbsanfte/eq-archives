    Nope. If you run away too fast you can always go back and pick the mob
up again - unless somebody's KS'd it which isn't that uncommon (tho im sure
always accidental and really who gives a rats ass) - the only time I've ever
been unable to find the mob again is when its run full pelt the wrong way,
im sure of it. I'm a pretty good puller, I don't usually make the mistake of
simply outrunning them.
