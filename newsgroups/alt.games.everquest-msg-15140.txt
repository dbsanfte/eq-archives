I'd believe 95% of new game software.  Or 95% by file size. :) But there's 
actually _tons_ of software available for Linux and Unix, and most of it 
is free.  Most of it does suffer from the disadvantage that you _may_ 
actually have to read the documentation, though.  

And personally, I feel that my newsreader, trn, kicks the ass of any 
other newsreader on any platform.  It has this one simple feature that the 
other newsreaders sorely lack... I've been using it for longer than those 
other newsreaders have even been around, and am familiar with 95% of its 
features.  All other newsreaders, I'd have to relearn how to do the stuff 
that works just fine for me here.  And it has special added benefits, like 
rendering HTML and binary posts to non-binary groups as total garbage, 
which is easier for me to ignore. :)

One of these days, they'll come up with something that I consider an 
actual improvement, and then I might upgrade.  But till then, why change?

But of course, VMS is the _best_ operating system.  Especially from a 
security standpoint.  Most of the people who ever knew how to hack into it 
have forgotten, and nobody sees the point in learning.  Security through 
obscurity... Ahh!

Anyway, I guess my point is this:  There really is no best platform, or 
best newsreader.  Saying "But your newsreader doesn't support feature X, 
get a real newsreader" is incredibly pathetic.  Gee, if I wanted feature 
X, maybe I'd get a newsreader that did that.  But the newsreader you're 
suggesting (a) doesn't support feature Y, which I value, and (b) supports 
feature Z, which annoys the piss out of me.

And I personally love the chaos of a thousand standards.
