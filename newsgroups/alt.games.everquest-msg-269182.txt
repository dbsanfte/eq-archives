Completing the final butterfly quest (collect the 3 collections)
gives a nice experience boost... something like 3 yellows when I
did it at level 13. Of course, one has to weigh that against the
time spent running around pouncing on sparkly question marks and
cursing about finding yet another plain purple.

I'm still missing two shattered bones, orc and erudite. Two friends
are also down to two bones each -- with orc one of them. Is the
shattered orc bone just hella rare or do you have to do something 
silly like go all the way to the Freeport side to find it?

And yeah I feel kinda cheated by this patch after the pain of working
Trapping up to 41.
