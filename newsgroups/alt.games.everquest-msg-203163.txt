I came back to the game awhile back..discovered KEI and it made it alot more
enjoyable soloing ..less sitting on your butt medding.. I solo alot..most of
the time thats what I enjoy doing and I really dont want to trouble anyone
finding a group as I may get on for a short time and not leave them holding
the bag so to speak.  Tonight after expending my mana I fell asleep while
waiting for it to regen to full...its the pits..
