Hi moron.  If you've read my posts for more than 20 seconds, you'd know im
not one of the people who bashes Sony everytime they take servers down or
patch.

Im sure if you stalk through my usenet history you may well find some
sony-critical posts! But guess what, 95% of what I say is not "oh sony
sucks, im going to the next new game". I've never posted that im quitting,
infact I don't think I've even muttered the letters W and O about a game in
this fucking newsgroup before today .

This patch of complete and utter unfinished bug ridden shit is just a step
too far. I don't expect new features to be perfectly unbugged code, i DO
EXPECT CRITICAL fucking bugs identified on test server to NOT be pushed live
though.  This patch offered nothing new, it introduced an incomplete (read:
not even finished the fucking development stage) bug ridden gfx system, and
shouldn't of ever happened.

Countless times in the past, bugs have been discovered for weeks on the test
server, and still pushed live 2 weeks after that date, this isn't 1 one off
or out of the ordinary, but i think this time its one step too far.

I dont expect perfection. I do expect somebody in Sony to have 2 fucking
braincells though and stop pushing this fucking shit live when its NOT
READY, DOESNT WORK, and causes MORE PROBLEMS than it fucking solves.
