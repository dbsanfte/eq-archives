I very much agree.  Wandering around, you're constantly challenging
yourself, breaking each new area as you get to it and then moving on and
breaking the rest.  Rather than just breaking the spawn once, and sitting
there pulling respawns one at a time as they happen for several hours.

I'd assume he means he plays on the Firiona Vie "roleplaying" server.  One
of the special rules there is that there is no common language.  Everyone
has to speak thier racial tounge, and over the course of many levels of
language training, they start to understand players of other races. (they
also capped advancement, so you can't learn other languages fast.)  To an
elf, anything a human says will appear as "Qkisk, jverrlona kOLkwo zh!"
instead of "Quick, everyone FOLLOW me!"
