lol... ok, well call it that then... my point is just that to spell words
phonetically to get across an accent is not incorrect at all, and using that
method with occasional words here and there is not necessarily sufficient
(though I'll admit it is in some cases, when you're showing a minor accent).
I don't think that complete incomprehensibility for the sake of
incomprehensibility is ok because the point is (or should be) to present
something people can read.  But neither do I believe that one or two "Suh"s
are sufficient to accurately present a thick Southern accent such as Rhett
Butler would have spoken.

For the record, though -- Under certain circumstances, "M'a b'tud h'duna
wa''msyin" or the like is ok, as in the following example:

---
"Y'b'tud!  Y'klkunny!"

After a moment of painful thought I translated the noises he was making to
mean, "You bastard!  You killed Kenny!"  and...
---

The reason it's ok in this example is that the writer is trying to show
total incomprehensibility... but notice that the following line "translates"
the gibberish.  If you're going to do something like that you should also
make it possible for the reader to understand what the gibberish means,
except in the unlikely case that it's part of the story that the reader
*not* understand what the speaker is saying.

Btw, the preceding example could be translated into EQ by using a hotkey:

Mekail says "Y'b'tud!  Y'klkunny!"

Mekail is making agonized, earsplitting noises that you manage to translate
after a moment of painful thought into "You bastard!  You killed Kenny!"

although that might tend to get a bit long to read if you do it too much, so
you may want to avoid it if you want people to have time to understand what
you're saying :)

Anyway, that's my final opinion on the subject, I think... feel free to
disagree, but (this not to you, but to the people who think nobody should
play EQ in a way they don't like) I'm going to continue speaking and emoting
in that way when I think it's appropriate... sorry if it offends you.

~!JDK!~
