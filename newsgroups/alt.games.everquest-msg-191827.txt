Noticed that the "new" hate plane went into effect on Stormhammer.
What changes were made? I noticed that patching to the test server a
few days ago by accident uploaded some new zone info on hate (a sub
zone of hate?). Im hoping this change will make hate more small group
friendly and more accessible to smaller raid forces (especially the
break in).
