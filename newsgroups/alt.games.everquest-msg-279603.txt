	Actually, if the non-raider equipment were better:

	a) raiders would want more of it and be motivated to group outside of raids
	b) non-raiders wouldn't be as much of a drag on raiders so more raiders 
would group outside their guild

	You can't tell me the 'average' raider doesn't group because they're 
just not into grouping. *If* the average raider doesn't group outside 
their guild, it's more likely because they have tried it numerous times 
in the past and found the loot totally unrewarding and the people they 
were grouped with craptacularly undergeared.

	Also, the sheer gap in gear nowadays creates such different 
expectations that raiders often don't understand the tactics used by 
non-raiders. This enhances the 'idiots everywhere' view that raiders 
take to pick up groups. EG: uberguilders take a different route through 
Creator on my server than single-groupers. This route is about 3 spawns 
faster, but means usually 2-3 more double pulls. To an uberguilder, 
doing it the slow way seems stupid, but when they force us to do it the 
fast way, there's about a 50% chance of a wipe.

	So we look stupid and incompetent, but it's really just a factor of me 
only having 10,000hp and 1900AC to play with. I'm doing everything I can 
about that, but for now that's all I've got to work with, and they're 
used to 16k/3k tanks.

	If the raiders were grouping upgrades they might change their tune on 
that one too. This is an equipment related phenomena, and isn't 
restricted to personality and behavioral differences between raiders and 
non-raiders.

	Incidentally I come down on the side of "roll on everything" in pickups 
groups nowadays too, but I do sympathise with anyone who's ever lost a 
roll on an upgrade only to see it sold in the bazaar.

	Rogues and insane monks are somewhat rare, but I'm all ears here ;)

	RE: creators being dominant, Sony have made the exact same mistake they 
made with LDoN, and have failed to listen to the advice that their 
playerbase gave them back then. The rewards for missions needs to 
automatically balance based on demand.

	For example, the old LDoN 'hostage' and 'assasination' missions were 
harder and more time consuming than 'collect' or 'slaughter' and gave 
the same reward, so people generally just didn't do them. This rendered 
a huge portion of the gameplay content of LDoN useless. We're seeing the 
same thing with DoN. What is needed is that missions that don't get used 
creep up in value according to a some grand balancing formula, and 
possibly that the over-used missions lose perhaps a maximum 25% of their 
value for being overused. This needs to be automatic so the market 
drives it and Sony only need to tweak the formulae, not the rewards 
themselves.

	A bit off topic, but I might make a separate post about it as it's 
fairly important.

	Those slots aren't worth much though. If you look at the LDoN gear, 
type 2 and 3 slots haven't been seen since, so all of those augs have 
been ground back into type 7 augs now. I'm guessing the same thing will 
happen with DoN stuff.

	Your predictable response is that raiders get no-drop stuff yada yada. 
You get type 8 augs, and raid gear's been type 8 since LDoN came out and 
hasn't changed.

	This undefined, unspecified and therefore anecdotal evidence, has no 
effect on the simple fact that DoN gear isn't EP or Time gear, or 
equivalent for most purposes.

	I do that. Why should I discuss something I'm not familiar with? 
Especially if it's totally irrelevant to the discussion. Time is 
critically relevant *because* it's 3 years old, and it's gear is still 
vastly better than *this year's* single-group gear.

	They were useless to me at level 30. They are one element of content 
*Truly* unused nowadays, except at their role in old quests. (eg the SK 
epic 1.0 required handins of some of the Sol Ro armour pieces)

	If you were a single grouper, you wouldn't go to KT or Yxxta either, 
and if you did you'd be smashed flat as quickly as I would. Raiders 
being better players is a myth. Get over it.

	Epic 1.5 or 2.0 planned? You mean they copy the text of the

	I don't lead if I can avoid it. It's high-stress, and I don't want high 
stress in my passtimes.

	Of course, planning and leading are two completely separate skills, and 
a lot of people have one and not the other.

	If they were truly better upgrades, they would get them. The reason why 
they keep the pouch is that it's the best item they could have in their 
range slot :P

	That isn't really borne out by the above considering you just explained 
that monks at both the Time and the Anguish level use the same item. Not 
really sure why you threw it in.

	So you admit that raiding is less boring and a better payoff for the 
time invested, and that in order to catch up with gear you had 3 
expansions ago, non-raiders have to put in an effort that you admit 
would cause you to committ suicide.

	And you don't think that's a problem?

	There are a lot of reasons someone might not raid. For myself, I  lived 
in the wrong timezone (US raiding guilds generally start raids at 8-10am 
my time). Others might have family or work committments, or have lots of 
time to play EQ but not in 4 hour bursts. Others might just plain not 
like to raid. Why should all of these people be penalised to the point 
where they can only upgrade (theoretically) to gear that's 3 expansions 
old, and only by putting in more time and effort than raiders have to 
for the latest and greatest?

	The implication being that non-raiders don't think and don't plan. I 
would argue that the average non-raider does more thinking and more 
planning than the average raider.

	As we established above, being generous, maybe 15% of raiders plan raids.

	Raiders get very limited choice as to their gear, as there is only one 
best-gear set with each expansion, and they have access to it. Wheras 
non-raiders have to guage their time, their plat, and their capabilities 
against what its available. They are more likely to do this by planning 
and thinking.

	Except if you can't find a Time tank you're screwed. You're doubly 
screwed if you're a non raider tank yourself.

	Here's where the reality of what non-raiders who *Aren't* tanks will 
accept.

	WoS hard side: 8k as a minimum, you will still get occasional 
complaints with 9.5k buffed. (I did, and I had almost all the mitigation 
and avoidance AA's at the time, as well as a fair bit of SK vampiric stuff)

	RCoD: I have yet to get a pickup group there (haven't really been 
trying though since I have what I need from the zone). When my crazy 
group used to go there 9k was where things started to get comfortable 
(long-term acceptable level of random deaths). Of course, we had a 
shaman healing who was better at it than most pickup clerics I've had.

	RS: I've been turned down by every person who's ever sent me a tell 
asking me to tank for a pickup group. Once I tell them I'm a 10k buffed 
tank, they say forget it. I'm told that 12k is accepted on my server.

	Personally, think basing it purely on HP is hilarious considering a 
tank might have 1k more HP than me and 150 fewer AA's (and subsequently 
tank very, very much worse). But hey, this is part of the reason why I 
hate the gear gap being so large: any dork with a couple of EP pieces 
could get groups in MPG even though they had half my AA's, months before 
I could.

	Yes this is a perception problem. Yes database tables are easier to 
change than human perceptions, preconceptions and prejudice.

	Probably on a lot of things. I think if you saw my side of the game 
you'd agree on most points, and if I saw yours I'd be more understanding 
of your viewpoint as well. You don't strike me as either an idiot or 
insane :P

	Well the monks usually lead the DPS charts any time I switch logging 
on, but I really don't know. The three top monks are very much obsessed 
with pulling, and bloody good at it :)

	On the other hand I rarely see them at 500dps :P
