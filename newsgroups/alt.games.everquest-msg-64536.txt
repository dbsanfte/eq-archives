I don't even get to the "Shadows of Luclin" patcher screen.  i get that little
gray box that says "connecting..."  I downloaded the everquest.exe file from
everquest.com and it downloaded some stuff, but now it says the servers are
down or something like that.  So in other words I can't long on because there
are too many people trying to get this huge smegging patch. I think I'll try
again at like 2:00am but if that don't work I'm sol for eq for a couple days
till this dies down.  I think...
