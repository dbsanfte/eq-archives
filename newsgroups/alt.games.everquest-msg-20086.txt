Too low to report though. I like to wait till they get up in levels
first so they won't just delete the character and start from scratch.
These lame names are all about control issues ("Fuk'n Verant not gonna
tell me what to do!") which is why I like to wait till they have
reached their 20s so they are forced to play a charatcer who has a
name forced on them or delete and start all over again. Most just
whine about it in /occ which is frosting on the cake for me. :-)
