I bought Luclin last night after having a friend tell me his P350 was
actually playing Lucin Ok. Not great, but ok. So I went and installed it,
patched it, but when I went to play I was having tremendous lag when looking
at various textures. Case in point, when I was running my Shaman into West
FP, the new textures (I'm suppossing) for the city wall, really slowed me
down, and my hard drive was hitting pretty good.

Here's my system specs:

P3 500
384 mb ram
Diamond Viper V770 Ultra (Nvidia TNT2 Ultra Chipset) Latest Detonator
Drivers
40 gb HD
Windows XP Home

I logged off, and turned off all the new char textures, the dynamic
lighting, and mip mapping.

When I logged back on it was still pretty laggy, so I turned the textures
down to Low, but it didn't change anything.

Is it possible to go back to the old world textures, with out having to
completely reinstall Everquest? Or is there something else that might work.
I exceed all of the minimum req. Just really boggled since my friends comp
seems to take it just fine, and he has less of a comp than mine.
