I honestly think this patch has killed of my carpenter.

Here's the problem:

1. Selling to the merchants does not even allow me to break even.
2. Doing trade writs does not allow me to break even.
3. Doing workshop tasks does not allow me to break even.
4. Furniture doesnt sell. I know a lvl 47 carpenter and he has sold a total 
of 4 beds!
4. Boxes within boxes. This is the death of the boxes market. Without 
durability on these the market is going to be flooded. I have already seen 1 
guy selling 35 boxes overnight. The maximum you used to be able to sell was 
6. In a week or so demand will have dried up and boxes will not sell.
5. Carpenters cannot make pristine components using their carpentry skills. 
If we want pristine it is going to cost us twice as much in fuel, we are 
already crafting at a loss.
6. NPC merchants sell better furniture than carpenters and are around 90% 
cheaper. A rare rug created by a carpenter looks the same as a 17s rug you 
can buy of a NPC.
7. Status reduction still not shown on furniture.
8. Less money in the game with the new patch, less people wanting higher 
tier rooms, less furniture for carpenters.
9. Furniture has no durability loss.

Overall I believe the Carpenter class has now been killed off :-(

I'll give it a week or two and if SoE dont show any signs of fixing the 
class I have worked so hard on then i'm off. I have had WoW for two weeks 
and not once have I thought about installing it, this patch though has 
totally ruined my carpenter.
