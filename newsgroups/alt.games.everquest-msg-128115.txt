Well I think that is is bullshit that you can play this game for years, and
never see any of the elite uniques.  Besides, if they wan't to stop farming,
all they have to do is increase the drop ratio of the good stuff.  Now I
agree that it would get boring quick if Windforces and the like dropped as
much as say, Cathans Seal or Isenharts Case, but it would be good to find
one once a year at least.
