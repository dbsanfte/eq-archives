Where's the balance problem? A mob's too hard and you don't have to
fight it, don't fight it. But if a mob's way too easy for the rewards
it gives, it's going to be basicly free xp/loot. Or do you think they
should have left the bug where Crushbone mobs were all dropping 999 of
every coin denomination?
