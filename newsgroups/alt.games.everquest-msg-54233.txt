I'm with you. I believe he had a legitimate objection, if what he said is
all true, and Sony screwed up at their end. Seeing as it happened on a
Sunday and he could get no response from Sony could only have added to the
frustration. Yes, it was a rant, but one that Sony appears to have deserved.
I wonder what else you could have compared Sony's approach with .... hall
monitor?... cinema usherette?...

I know what it's like.... when you want to play, you have to play that very
instant.

(On a technical point, does naming the Gestapo qualify as invoking Godwin's
Law?   Will the law be extended to cover such things as Luftwaffe,
lederhosen...... liebfraumilch perhaps ?)
