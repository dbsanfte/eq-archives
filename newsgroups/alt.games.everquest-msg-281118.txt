On the contrary, after the Challenger disaster, while people were still 
holding out hope that the cabin may have fallen in a single piece and 
some or all of the astronauts might still have been alive and 
recoverable, I heard the following:

Why do the vending machines at NASA all sell Sprite?

Because they couldn't get Seven Up.

I thought it was in very poor taste, and I still don't think its all 
that funny, but it -was- before they'd finished counting the dead.

Black humor is part of some people's coping mechanism, and then again, 
other people are simply insensitive clods.  Either way, some people 
-will- make this kind of joke, and there will always be some other 
people who think its too soon.
