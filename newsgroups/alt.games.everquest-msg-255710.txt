You'd raid Luclin to enable you to raid  Quarm to enable to you to raid 
in GoD to enable you to raid OoW....

Successfully progressing is its own reward. I'd be stunned if all you 
raiders said the only reason you put up with it is to make you more uber 
soloers.

Defining easier in terms of time investment? I'd have to hope that would

/shrug

That pretty much sums up why I think most people raid. Because its the 
only way to advance further... the only way to go where they haven't 
gone before.

Are you seriously trying to tell me the only reason -you- raid is so 
that you can be more uber when you solo? Here I thought all you raiders 
said you needed the uber gear for -raiding-. Apparently you don't have 
the slightest interest in raiding for its own sake. Its just a means to 
further your ability to solo?? Surely not?

The real question is after you've earned your uber raid gear what are 
you wasting time soloing for? You've already got far better stuff than 
you'll ever see soloing... as an active raider with modern raid gear... 
how is soloing improving your character?

And if in fact, all you ever wanted to do was solo, but are raiding 
because that advances your solo ability, then I'd think you'd be 
thrilled. You'd no longer have to raid in order to maximize your soloing 
capabilities; it frees you from a doing a ton of raiding, which you 
evidently have no interest in for its own sake anyway.
