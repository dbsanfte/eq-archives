    Every loot decision on major items involves drama, unless you have a
points system. Then the system itself is the cause of drama and endless
debate.

    Or, if you're in the top guild on the server, watch them E-Bay and use
the money to buy Mexican whores. (The quote "So, Toobig, how many Mexican
whores did that SoD get ya?" from an otherwise quiet member of the guild
still cracks me up.)

    It also doesn't work well. There's a lot of fights that last longer than
Defensive, and once that MA goes down you have a lot of poorly-equipped
tanks up. If you do the officer decision method, I believe it's wiser to
spread the drops around. You lose less if someone leaves, and you get a
better handle on what you can do as a guild (since all your tanks are about
the same in terms of survivability). You also avoid having folks leave (see
below).

    We had a big discussion on "why do folks leave EQ" recently due to a
spate of old-guard players leaving. The things we came up with:

(1) Desire to recapture "a real life". Some people ignore their marriages,
their jobs, even their own well-being to put as many hours into EQ as
possible. Some of our guild members who left even talked about having people
in their lives perform "interventions" to get them back.

(2) Completion of goals. Ask the folks in your guild, "What do you want to
do in EQ?" Some people say things like, "Kill the greatest mobs in EQ."
Those folks tend to quit if and when you actually slay those big mobs. Look
at last expansion - the biggest number of "famous" departures came when
everything in Velious was dead, and Luclin wasn't out yet.

    The other people in your guild will define what they want to do in terms
of their character - "I want to get my epic, and full ToV armour!" These
people will leave a lot sooner than the "Kill the big mobs" folks, because
people define gear goals in terms of what's known, and the "next big mob" is
usually an unknown. You can delay them leaving by spreading loot around.
They never get a full set of what they want before the next big target's
loot table is known, and so they update their wants and continue playing to
get the next shiny bauble. But they're always close to leaving. We actually
had a thread called "Come on out, lootwhores!" on our internal board
recently where folks were asked to name the top five things they wanted in
game. It was amusing how you could tell the two basic types of "completion
of goals" types apart based on what folks wanted and how they asked.
