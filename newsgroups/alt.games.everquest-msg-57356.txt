I like much the old troll shaping. The new one is too thin too tall look too
humanoid and not bestial enough.

What I can see in all the SOL screenshots is it look flat (poorly enlightned
and dark compared to what I have with the current EQ on my Voodoo3 card. I'd
say it has poor lightning and global environmental light is too strong
compared to other light sources. Some lack of contrast I'd say.

Humans look more like subburbs teens guys and less like adventurers. Shaved
too much, too clean too much like Walt Disney characters.

I'd much like to see them more dusty, hairy, and the clothes not look so new
( a more loose ore used look would have suited more ).

The barby doll and smart look should be kept for high elfs and paladin
expecially sure.

Wood elfs tend to hate to makup like babes. They sometimes use some natural
painting as a camo in the forest.

The sole characters that I found neat in the SOL graphis where Kerrans and
Iksars.
