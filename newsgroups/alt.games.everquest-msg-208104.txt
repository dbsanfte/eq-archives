I disagree, that is an abuse of the word greed.

I never said that we were being selfless.  In fact, I laid out
exactly what our (collective) self-interest was.  That does
not make choosing collective goals and actively pursuing them
acts of greed.

A quick google on dictionary+greed leads to these definitions:
1. reprehensible acquisitiveness; insatiable desire for wealth
2. excessive desire to acquire or possess more (esp material
wealth) than one needs or deserves

Now, I don't see us as being reprehensible, insatiable, or
excessive.  We play for fun, congratulate one another on
milestones great and small, and frequently help one another
as well as folks outside the guild to achieve goals in the
game.  The mere fact that we are not saints does not imply
that we are demons.  We're just ordinary folks muddlin
through as best we can.  And while we're not universally
inclusive (this is an EQ players guild, not an RL Christian
congregation) we happily invite others of likemind to join us.
