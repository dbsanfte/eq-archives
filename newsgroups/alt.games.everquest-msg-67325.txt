Unfortunately, I do believe that somewhere it specifically states that if
you lose possessions during an item transfer, you are out of luck.  I am
patching atm (NO WAY!?!) and don't want to open any other windows to go look
for the link, but I'm sure others here can provide it...  Basically, I
believe it goes something like this:  If you lose an item due to poor
decision making (ie: asking someone you don't know well to hold something
for you for a bit) then you eat the loss.  If you lose something due to the
game f'ng up, THEN the powers that be will step in and take action.

As for your Guild Member, I would get their side of story and then talk to
the other Officers in the Guild to see what they feel should/could be done.

Sorry I can't offer any more help atm.  We're UNINSTALLING Luclin...  LOL
We're giving up for now and will simply install when the new machines get
here.
