Since when is labour 'virtually nothing'. I'm surprised they didn't note 
how live bands start with nothing but their equipment, produce no 
tangible lasting good, and yet many manage to earn a decent living out 
of it.

When you figure the amount of hours these people put into these games 
relative the the pittance they can sell items for, you are better off 
working at McDonalds... much better off.
