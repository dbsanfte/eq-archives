They can...only they do it so well they convince themselves and gate, naked,
to their bind points.

Yes...Think about it, the main stay of a group is Fight, Healer, Caster...if
all those classes could fight solo there would be little challenge when
grouped.

I think this was Verants plan with the Exp penalties, make it less viable to
solo so you need to group to get decent exp.
The idea behind that was not to nerf the solo classes only to make them WANT
to group in the same way as the non-solo classes NEED to group.
Obviously there was a backlash to this and the effects were altered.
Now, you've prolly seen all the casters (and Monks) solo'ing in there
favourite spots...Hell I thought Wyverns in CS ALWAYS travelled stacked in
4's...imagine now that Warriors (and if Warriors then why not Rogues) could
also solo...there isn't enough space for them.

I don't believe classes were made with the intent that they could play on
their own so well, it just turned out that way and weakening the class so it
couldn't would only make them next to useless for a group.
