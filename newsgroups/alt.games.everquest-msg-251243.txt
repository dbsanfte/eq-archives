Hmm.  Let's try that again...

Ok, I got a couple more.  Let's write the AGE 'How to keep PP' guide!

1.  Do not, ever, start twinks.
2.  Don't buy mounts either.
3.  Never develop an interest in tradeskills, especially tailoring and
    Smithing
4.  There is no "casino".  All rumors you may have heard about the 
    existence of casinos are distracting fabrications.  Any players you 
    hear talking about one are just making a funny joke.
5.  Tribute Master?  What tribute master?
