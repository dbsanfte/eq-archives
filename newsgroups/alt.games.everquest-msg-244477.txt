Or that they've since lost that one testicle they still had back then.

I had a copy of my monk on Test for a while.  It of course became greatly
outdated, and when new over-60 stuff was being tested I asked that it be
updated.  The response, "we have plenty of monks on Test".  The bugs
introduced, numerous.  They should wipe Test server monthly and just copy
over some peoples' characters for testing when it's actually needed and,
*gasp*, actually use it as a "test" server.
