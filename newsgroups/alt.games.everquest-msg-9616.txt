uhhh...hampton gennings was the name on the email address that you sent me
the email from...fucking moron...

most likely some pseudo name you conjured up when you signed up for the
account you brainless twit...but you're just too dumb to remember...

what a goofball...read the header...it's right in front of YOUR email
address...

It's probably YOUR real name afterall...makes perfect sense as to why you'd
always be in such a tiff...I'd be like that too if someone named me
HAMPTON...rofl...
