Marks and Jewels found in Luclin zones are for quest armor, try looking 
on allakhazam in section for Twilight Sea.
Most of the blood listed can be used for pottery quests from Sharvahl, 
kitties are most interested in them i guess.  Try looking at 
eqtraders.com for more info on the luclin trade quests.
The rest I haven't seen because my highest character is only 37.
