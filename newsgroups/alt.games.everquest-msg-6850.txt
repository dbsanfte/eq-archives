Anyone else getting this? I ran the patching program ofcourse, when I
started the game, it patched it and gave me the whole patch message, but
when I try to connect to the login server it says I have an incorrect
version? Anyone else getting this problem? Or is the error message just
wrong and means I cant connect just because of congestion?
