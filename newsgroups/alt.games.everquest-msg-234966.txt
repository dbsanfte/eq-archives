}Now the question is - is snare+flamelick better taunt than slow+incapaciate
}+Sicken (cheap, very fast casting)?

In my experience, flamelick, incapacitate, and sicken really aren't all 
that much aggro.  So really, you're comparing snare and slow.

Yes, they're significant aggro.  They're just insignificant compared to 
snare and slow.  And I bet, all else being equal, snare would win.  But 
tash/slow would beat snare.

This is pretty much a wild guess, though.  I haven't actually logged an 
experiment to back it up.  Since I'm in a "pull numbers out of my ass" 
mood, let's try assigning some actual values:

flamelick: 25
incapacitate: 50 
sicken: 35
ensnare: 550
tepid deeds: 400 (actually, slows probably range from about 100 to about 
                  700 depending on the level/type of slow and level of 
                  caster, and whether it's resisted) 
tashania: 350    (tashes vary similarly.  lowest tash was clearly less 
                  aggro than howl of tashan, eg.)

There.  Some wild estimates.  Someone wanna propose different numbers that 
might actually be justified by like, facts, or something?
