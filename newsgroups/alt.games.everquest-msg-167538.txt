I cannot decide between the two classes. I want to be a class thats
always in need on high level raids. Since there are plenty of both
already on all the servers, which one is in more demand? I would say
cleric, since a warrior can never get too much healing during a raid.
I'd also like to be able to solo. Can clerics and chanters do this?
I've heard that chanters can using fear and pet... etc. I really like
the idea of having clarity all the time but then I read that chanters
spells use more mana than other classes. What do you guys think about
which class I should play? Thanks

Steve
