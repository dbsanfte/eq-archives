Yeah, I've used DL a few times and just don't see the use in most
cases.

2 of my favorite 'pets' are guild warriors, so...

Good point.  Either or was useful a lot in BW, but now that's going
all light blue for the things I might solo so I will have to revisit
that slot.

In my lowbie non-uber world, AC does seem to make a difference.  I
hadn't heard this news before.

I rely on it a lot when soloing to single-pull.  Seems to work to me.

Sometimes I'll put gate in that slot instead.  We're not raiding the
ubah-zones yet so rarely do I need DA AND DB up at the same time.

Good point!  Atone is now in the mix for a potential slot 6.  I
learned this the hard way two nights ago running across a zone.  Got
the thing rooted, but then didn't have atone up.

Oooh, I do love that little hammer.  He's a lot of fun.

What are the thoughts on Mark of Retribution?  I finally acquired it
(yeah, bought it in the bazaar).  The description on Casters Realm
makes it seem kinda useful, but haven't tried it yet.

A typical grind night usually involves myself and a pair of warriors
and a shaman.  Fights typically will last around a minute or so.  Is
this spell useful in that scenario?
