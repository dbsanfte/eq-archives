I'm not surprised.  I have a friend who's both a Mac enthusiast and
a MMORPGer.  He's been losing interest in DAOC and knew some other
friends and I were playing EQ, so when he saw MacEQ on sale for $10
he decided to pick it up.  He was rather dismayed to learn that his
version would NOT let him play with me, because the Windows and Mac
versions can't use the same servers.

He ended up exchanging his purchase for the Windows version (since
he does have a Windows box as well), so SOE didn't lose him as a
customer, but he couldn't imagine limiting himself to a Mac-only
community in an online game.

I guess I can see that it makes the server-side code easier to write
if you know that you're dealing with a Windows-only (or Mac-only)
graphics engine on the client, but it's still a shame they couldn't
find a way to let both types of client use the same servers.
