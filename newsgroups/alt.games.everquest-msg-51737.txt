I'm not open or vulnerable, I take great pains to make certain of that.

You don't know me, you don't know what my training, skillset and
expertese are.

No threat, no veiling.  Told you were vulnerable, and that I could open
you up.  Deal with it. If I wanted your box I would have your box.  BUT,
I'm not going to break any laws to get it.  Perhaps you don't understand
the difference between can and do.  Perhaps,  you think that because I
have the equipment to drive drunk that I ought to? 

That is charming.  Do you eat feces too?
