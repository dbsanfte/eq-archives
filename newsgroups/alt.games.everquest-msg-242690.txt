Whenever I am slower I generally announce slow resists instead, and when
I get the mob slowed after a resist. Less spam, and the healer still
knows when the mob is slowed and when it isn't.

I also tend to group mostly with guildies, and the better you know the
people you group with the less spam is needed, of course. Still, even
in pickup groups I prefer to just assume everyone is doing their job.
