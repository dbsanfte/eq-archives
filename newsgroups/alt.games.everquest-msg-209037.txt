i got in a bit of a tiffle with a relatively new player (know him IRL) when
he didn't listen to me about working on STA as a ranger...he decided he
wanted AGI instead, since it was the "green stat" on the char creation
window

we're not talking about big numbers, maybe just something like 30-50 points,
like 20k or so in gear, but i think STA is much more important than AGI,
even for a ranger

am i wrong?

is it possible that rangers have their own "defense table" and agi is the
"important" stat?

sta is hp and agi is chance to avoid damage and lessen damage, or whatever
(no debating that! if i'm wrong about that, let me be wrong for the sake of
my coming point....=p...)..soo.............

if a ranger hits 55 and isn't main-tanking and isn't archery-freakin'-tastic
..... would the ranger do better to spend AA on combat agility (chance to
avoid damage, like SUPER-AGI) or natural durability (bonus hp, like
SUPER-STA)?

i think a good answer to the AA question may help, but not supercede the
question about regular STA v AGI

and thank you
