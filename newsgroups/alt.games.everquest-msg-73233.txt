    At minimum, get some Forest Loops for the AC and the likely-needed AGI.
I prefer Electrum Black Sapphire Earrings, some prefer Gold Black Sapphire
Earrings - both are good, made with JC, the Black Sapphires drop in camps
you've been in in Sebilis.

    Heh, a WIS-cleric for sure! If you're happy being a low AC, low HP
punching bag, or if Jakugg simply won't let you get hit, then more power to
you.

>Silver threaded bandana (compliments of werewolf invasion) 2AC 1STA 2WIS
>5 Mana

    The Runed Circlet from Permafrost is AC 4 WIS 4 INT 4. I'm partial to
the Skull Shaped Barbute myself (AC 13 HP 35 Sv. Magic 10) - makes up for a
lot of AC deficiencies elsewhere. The Hate helm has five WIS on it, too - at
your level getting a trip to Hate should become a priority.

>Platinum armband 3STR 3WIS

    Find Ulthork Arms. AC 8 and 3 WIS. Too many zero AC items and you become
an honorary druid!

>Polished bone bracer 2AC 3WIS 3INT

    Get a second quest bracer, or possibly a Runed Mithril Bracer (AC 4 STR
3 WIS 5 - the camp in Sol B it drops in will have greened out for you now).

>Adamite Epaulets 9AC 7WIS

    You will have this for a LONG time, so be happy with it. 8)

>Chestplate of the Constant 20AC 8STA 5SvMagic

    The Hate BP would be ideal. Things you could get in Sebilis include the
Froglok Scale BP and the Seb Scale Tunic.


>Fine Steel Girdle 9AC

    An AC 10 STA 5 WIS 5 belt, cleric only, drops in Fear. A trip to Fear
might be in order. 8)

>Gatorscale leggings 7AC 4WIS 15 HP

    Look up the Kromriff Military Leggings quest in Velious. Check to make
sure dwarf clerics can wear them. 8) The Hate leggings are also very nice.

>Boots of the Reliant 11AC 6SvDisease

    The Hate boots would be an upgrade here (see the pattern yet?)

>Springwood Club 5WIS 5STR 5INT (who cares what the dam/del ratio is- I'm
>not fighting anyway)

    If you're not fighting and you know it, look into getting a Paw of
Oppala. No, don't camp it unless you want to hate EQ. There's also something
called the Cone of Mystics in the Crypt area in Sebilis - AC 5 INT/WIS 5
MANA 50.

>Testament of Vanear 10WIS 10 Mana

    Go to a Charred Guardian Shield from Sol A at minimum. A very nice
shield (Ac 20 WIS 9 MANA 40) drops in the Frenzied camp in Velk's, as well.
You NEED AC in the Secondary slot. A nice shield (AC 18 all saves plus 10)
also drops in - wait for it - Hate.

>Small Wisdom Diety 2WIS

    Look up the Coldain Shawl quests. The Baking one nets you a very nice
ranged slot item (AC 3 INT/WIS 3 MANA 30 Sv. Cold 3 Sv. Magic 3) in addition
to the shawl.

    Good luck!

    James
