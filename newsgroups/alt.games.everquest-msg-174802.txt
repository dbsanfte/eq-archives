switch now you still can to dualwielding try to get a glowing black sword
for your offhander and a centi ss for primary. the +20 dex will raise your
skill fast enough to do some decent damage. (did about simular with my bard)
after your skills are up skill = 5 x lvl keep the glowingblacksword in the
bank if you are looking for upgrades. When you buy a weapon with a proc
there are times you really would love the +20dex.

Or stick with 2hb. warrior epic is even a 2hs or 2 1hs you can choose that.
It's up to you. for warriors it's kind of undecided. (most prefer dual
wielding though) wich make the demand for 2hs weaps less and prolly the
price as well.
