Actually, I think thats one of it's biggest flaws, rathter than it's beauty.
By the time I've done 6 or 7 levels in any one location, I'm usually pretty
burned out on it.    I'm now currently going on my 11'th straight level of
doing next to nothing except Mistmoore adventures, since thats all I can get
pickup groups for.
