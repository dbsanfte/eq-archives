Let me catch up first!! I am still level 3 and have been playing constantly
for 2 weeks. I'm also uber twinked, got myself some Banded Armor that a high
level uber dude crafted for me and a Fine Steel Long Sword (woot!). I know
quite abit about EQ and put all my starting points into INT since i'm a
warrior ofcourse, that makes me alot smarter than the average tank. So if
you need any expert help just wait at level 10 until i catch up in a couple
of months plz. BTW: Can i have sum pp?
