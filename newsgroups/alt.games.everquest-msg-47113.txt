Go live in Crystal Caverns and hunt the orcs, best place to do it at is the
bottom of the pit to the right where it turns white, youll find a nice lil
pathing bug there about the way things move if you pull to the back of the
firsy room and jump up and downt the ledge.

Now you can score a number of velium weapons here, and the ore if you can find
a tailor looking for it can fetch you a couple 100pp a stack, on Tallon there
going for upwards of 250pp.

Or if you got a couple tank buddys and a cleric friend, hunt the Ulthurk
hunters and warriors in the north in Eastern Waste. Great Exp and there a quest
for there tusk in Colbart Scar. get 4 tusk and head to Skyshrine. ask someone
to get you to CS, and  once there head to the beach and find the otter chief.
Rewards for the quest will fetch you from 100pp to venders to 1000's from
players, thats if your lucky and get a diamond or blue diamond.

On a side note, you can solo in CC till 35, and then the ulthurks till 43. I
made 60k getting to 43 in EW alone.
