Don't forget to be aggravated at the people who give beggars stuff. They
make it lucrative to be a beggar. They are the ones who aggravate me. I can
ignore beggars but I can't do anything about the people who give to beggars.

(I mean people who give things to people who beg for it, not people who drop
things on lower level characters who don't beg.)
