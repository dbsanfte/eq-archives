	I'm wondering what they're going to do when the first Ranger they send in
gets feared before he can engage and Weaponshield.  Assuming she doesn't just
nuke him into the ground first.

	Not to mention Gore's AE -- you know, the one with the 70% slow -- has a
300 foot range (and resists at -150).  They're going to have to pull her
perfectly and position her perfectly or they'll all get hit by it, which will
pretty much pooch the deal.

	I'm a philosophy student so I'm not allowed to say "impossible" -- but I
wouldn't bet on it happening, and certainly not on a regular basis.  All Team
MB had to do was line up one shot; the job would be a hell of a lot harder for
Team Trueshot.
