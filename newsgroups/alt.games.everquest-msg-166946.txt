Its laziness, and ignorance, not stupidity.

Most items, vendors offer stunningly low prices for.

Most items, vendors sell for astonishingly high prices.

Experience, then, will tell you that dealing with vendors is generally a bad
deal for everyone;
the items essentially leave the game and you only have a pittance to show for
it.

There are, though, some items where the vendors offer more money than anyone
would pay.  Only direct experience with vendors on these items will give you
that information, though, and relatively lazy people have learned that 99 times
out of a hundred you can skip that step.

The bazaar is a funny place.  People set prices fairly arbitrarily.  Then other
people come along, check prices for their item, and deliberately undercut their
competition in order to get quicker sales.  This can go thru several
iterations, with the price dropping lower and lower.

Say you come in, use your more deliberative method of checking merchant price
and adding a markup.  You offer ITEMX at 120pp since the vendor will pay you
100.  Bobsmule comes in to dump his ITEMX, sees you at 120, and goes for 110.
Janesmule sees 110 and offers at 100.  Joebob puts his at 90.  Laughingbill
puts his in at 80.  Then you log in, look around, buy out Joebob and
Laughingbill, sell all three items to vendor for 100pp each, and pocket the
30pp extra profit while leaving Jane and Bob scratching their heads... not only
did the people selling for less than they did get sales, but so did the guy
priced higher than them?

There are even items commonly sold to vendors that sell to players for
substantially more than the vendors charge to sell them back.  A common example
are gems; the quest gems for velious armors fetch about 40pp, you can buy them
for around 80pp, and players will pay anywhere from 200 to 2000 pp for them
(depending on the gem and how long you are willing to wait)

If you are of a mind, you can pay close attention to these things and come out
with some fabulous bargains.  People do the same sort of thing in the real
world, shopping yard sales and so forth for desperately underpriced
collectibles... if you like that sort of thing, more power to you.

I don't care enough, pre-bazaar I vendored almost everything, and even now I'm
as likely to vendor diamonds and blue diamonds as I am to bother moving them to
a mule.
