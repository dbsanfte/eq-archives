Does anyone know why Tak Whistler would not be open for business (at least
on the Bristlebane server, he isn't)

I need to get my some lvl 19 Druid spells from him, and he keeps saying he
is busy. Are these spells available elsewhere? Is it anything to do with the
plague that seems to be endemic around the Karanas?

I did petition, but got no answer for an hour, at which point I had to log
