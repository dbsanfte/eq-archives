Wow, that's nice. I've always felt that our gambling, gift and death 
taxes were the ones that really showed how far the government will go to 
  confiscate our money.

Good point, there could easily be a list of items that are simply tax 
free (although, that could lead down the same slippery slope that got us 
into the current tax-code nightmare that we have now). That, in essence, 
gives you a tax break on your medical stuff. Of course, given the 
current mentality in the US, the left would be quick to point out how 
that is more beneficial to the rich because they would get an unfair 
"tax break".
