At some levels clerics may nuke better than druids... but
in the long run, not so

Horses and bards don't work indoors, nor are any of the
above useful for a cleric who is trying to speed up his
group mates.  Group with a bard, in particular, isn't a
cleric thing, thats a bard thing.

MoR, MoK.  Not exactly DS, but interesting in their own rights.  I enjoy
a 32 DS stacking with 15 MoR, if we are operating without a slower
that can add up to a heck of a lot of damage.

Yep, we get to summon four packs, druids only ever get to
summon one at a time.  Four or eight food and the same
in water and you are good for a couple hours camp.  Some
clerics can forage, too, I think (Halflings?)

Yes, but the first two don't count, they do less damage
to the target on a per mana basis than comperable
anti-undead nukes.  The final undead DoT is fierce,
though, lots of damage per mana, and Fast for a DoT,
so lots of damage per tic.

Mage summon, this is not a cleric thing.  Maybe if
you get your cleric a pegasus cloak, you can talk.

Any number of perma EB items now, and frankly the
EB spells suck for most applications, I've rezed far
more dead in Kedge from drowning than I ever have
from actual mob kills.

They do, actually, they just mostly don't know it,
and the ones they get aren't very good, easily
resisted, all do damage, and I think all might be
AE... dunno on that part.  Stun and Stun Command
are head and shoulders over any damage producing
stuns.

AE Fear sucks.  Clerics get a full line of real fears that work
on all, and are arguably the best fear class in the game.

Hardly.  Well maybe with PoP, dunno about that.  Nexus is...faster than
a boat, but still a wait and then probably a second wait, and even then
you get FOUR destinations.  Casters bound in Firepots room are a
better example, but still not all that good.

>

Non stackable, one or two charges item?  NOT the same thing.  Now
if you show me a innoruk cleric with clicky snare, you might have a point,
its not nearly as good as druid line snares, but any snare much much
better than none.

But most characters are KoS in most zones anyway, this matters so rarely
its hardly worth considering.  And you aren't KOS in GD, by the way, it
merely makes your faction worse... I'm Ally even in wolf form to the Coldain,
have been for ages.

Druid heals do suck, perfectly good heals way too late to be truely
worthwhile.  I don't forsee that changing much, though.
