Hehe!

Lucky I haven't got a machine that will run EQ2 and I am not interested 
in it anyway!

Where I work. Outlook was removed and Internet Explorer was rewritten 
with all Java and active X components removed to give a basic browser. 
It also has an automated cookie remover installed!

At home I have Windows 98lite!

This removes all of Internet Explorer, Outlook Express and the HTML 
execution programme that runs behind them in Windows that normally 
remains even if IE is removed!

Result a 20% increase in winmark speeds and most virus and worm routes 
removed to boot.

I use Opera for browsing and Turnpike for mail / news!

I can run Java if I need to. But activeX  It's in the bin where it 
belongs.

My polite view of activeX is that it's a naive piece of programming from 
a cosy era that never existed.
