The problem with that idea is, just because you went to school for 12 
years and paid a billion dollars to be a top-notch lawyer, doesn't mean 
you can pay $500 and spend five minutes learning to be a top-notch 
doctor.  *Maybe* level 15.  At 20 I expect someone to know their role in 
the game, whereas at 15 I realize that everybody is awkward and trying 
to figure out how to slip into the correct role.  But it still moves you 
past the reallyreallyboring large rats/derv camps stage, and just means 
you have to stay in Oasis/HHP for a couple days.

...Although it would be DAMN nice to make putting someone into a 
different char as a punishment.  That MA not listening to your pleas to 
stop breaking mez?  Throw HIM into a chanter and start throwing angry 
mobs at him.  Every death he encounters loses him exp on his main char.  
And NOBODY in his group gets access to the assist hotkey.
