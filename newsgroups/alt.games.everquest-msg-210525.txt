It's supposed to be a device that will send macros to various keyboards.
Gomo says it doesn't work very well with EQ - the lag is too much - and that
he kinda regrets buying it.  He's simply learned to move from keyboard to
keyboard and use the apporpriate hotkeys.  Gomo says he can do it without
really thinking about it.  I can't argue with that - haven't seen him make a
mistake yet.

I used to have a wireless keyboard that I gave up for the same reason - the
lag was much too much.  And that was just one-boxing.  =)
