1)  Don't top post.   Top posting makes the baby jesus cry.

2)  Rygorr chain coif is indeed head slot wearable.  (and only head slot)

3)  Yes, Rygorr chain coif is one of the (sadly few) head slot items that do
not give a helmet graphic at all.   The rest of the set gives Velious
textured chain look.  Or at least did until they took the Velious textures
out.   It gives normal chain look now.
