No rules. Many sellers will auction dozens or more identical items at 
once.

The primary reason a store wouldn't want to auction thousands of 
identical items simultaneously is that the flood of over supply would 
drive the price down.

Online games are simply not as substitutable. 

Any of dozens of motherboards will host my components successfully, any

If all my friends are playing everquest, then buying WoW because its 
cheaper and I think the customer service is better will not let me play 
with my friends. Its not like buying a honda instead of a toyota.

"to some degree"? That would be a considerable understatement, imo.
