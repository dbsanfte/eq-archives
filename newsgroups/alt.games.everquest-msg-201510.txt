I have a 60 druid and i have a friend who has a 61 druid and a 56 ranger he
enjoys them both but perfers his druid i think alot is how you like to play
i would say that ablities for solo play would belong to the druid but with a
ranger you get the cross of warrior and druid i would say its all about what
you like to do in the game.
To me a druid rules you can group or you can solo either way  you rule and
you help in groups. But this is just my opinion.
