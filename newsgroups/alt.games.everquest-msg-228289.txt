I'm not sure I'm following you...  are you saying that all your SKs/bards in
your guild are ebayed?  :P  Or are you just tempering your earlier statement
because you realized you had said "SKs make better pullers always" followed
by "I always pull" and those weren't congruous?

They aren't lore.  They're usually for sale in the Bazaar.  And I didn't say
the gland gave me snare, I said the gland gave me snare "if I want to use
it" (i.e., situationally useful).  But then I carry a Vox stick too, because
I don't care if it's charged, while the charges are there it's a handy thing
to have around.

I would assume that you don't have a GVD then, as it's not unlimited
charges.  Correct?

And honestly, you learn the split as normal, and then you find the one
instant where a snare would make the difference between trying over and over
and over and over again and getting it right away, and you use *1* charge of
snare in a committed pull.  Just like when I'm heading somewhere and need
invis, I ask someone in my group for invis knowing full well I have my GVD
in a bag?  Why?  Because it's there for when it makes a difference.

And if you had the slightest capability to comprehend the written word,
you'd realize that's what was just said in this thread.

Seriously, taken a few too many hits to the head recently?  Meds run out? 
Why do you feel the need to argue with me, and then quote someone that said
exactly what has been said in this thread before you showed up?
