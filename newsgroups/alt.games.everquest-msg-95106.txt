Bristlebane worshipping and AE songs, probably. Wearing a DE mask
might help a little. Also, the dragoons are not trained. They patrol
the path from the outpost to near the ledge at night and have a pretty
large aggro range. I spent 8 levels in Overthere and was only killed
by dragoons twice; both times through making mistakes.

Keep an eye open for them, and be ready to selo out of there if you're
on ledge and they're headed that way.
