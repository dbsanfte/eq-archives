Same here. Played since 2001, and my highest is 58.

Interestingly enough, I've recently /movelog'ed to Stromm, and I've 
encountered a surprising (and refreshing) number of true new lower level 
players. I've had to answer questions like, "RFP?" and "Taunt doesn't do 
anything, why should I use it?" quite often of late.

If you think they're not there, it's likely only because you're not there 
to see them.
