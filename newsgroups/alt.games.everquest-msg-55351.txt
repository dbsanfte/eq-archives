Not very hard. But a very long camp.

: buy Jboots..is that true?  Basically what is best way to speed my slow self

No, JBoots are not to be bought anywhere, no drop. But I think they sell
something called TBoots in Sol B or soemthing. They are slower than JBoots
(I think?) or have a longer casting time (are jboots instant?) and
quite expensive. Another alternative at your level is make a few plat
and find shamen selling sow potions .. about 10 pp per dose normally.
