Yes, there's a difference at higher levels.  Isn't
there a difference at lower-levels?  My 30ish monk can
get more than half a yellow in 30 minutes, for instance,
while a rez only grants half a yellow.  A port, to him,
is worth more than a rez, in terms of XP "lost," assuming
equal opportunities for each.

In almost ALL cases I've seen, people wanting a rez at
lower levels aren't really looking for XP;  they ARE
looking for a port back to their corpse.  Even when
power-leveling a player, its more important to just
get them back and fighting (which a rez does better
than a port) than it is to get the XP back.

So, no, there's not a difference between the two based
on time.  It's level dependent, not action dependent.
Or are you going to argue that a level 6 Erudian needs
a rez more than a port to, say, EC where the hunting
opportunities are far greater?
