A lot depends on how far from the zone they are.  If they are less than an
18 second run away, another possibility is for the Cleric to heal the
Warrior, until the Cleric has aggro, and then the Warrior can take off
running.  The Cleric, who should be able to tank for a few seconds to let
the Warrior get ahead, can then DA and follow.

The problem with that is it makes CR harder.  A group that consists of naked
Warrior, naked Ranger, and fully equiped Cleric and Wizard will have an
easier time getting in and getting two corpses, than a group consisting of
all four of them naked going in for all four corpses will.
