I recently had a package that according to the UPS tracking information was
shipped from New York to Illinois over a 32 hour period, unloaded in IL,
then 4 days later (and 2 calls to UPS later) it ended up delivered to my
apartment's management office here in Oklahoma.  I guess UPS has teleport
ability in emergencies, knows a druid who uses SoW or wolf form which
doesn't use tracking numbers, or contacted a wizard or druid or other
porting class.  Something strange is going on when a package is unloaded in
one state, then without being moved gets delivered to another state a few
hundred miles away.
