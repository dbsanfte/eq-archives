Funny, they have their own genre name in the U.S., too.

Hentai isn't "especially common."  It occupies about the same percentage of
the Japanese comics market (which is enormous with a capital ENORMOUS) as
"skin mags" do of the U.S. "traditional" magazine market.

The U.S. perception of Hentai is skewed because of the culture shock of this
"children's" medium being used to show stuff clearly "not for kids."  The
reality is that comics (both in the U.S. and Japan ... and Europe, too, to a
different degree) are *just another entertainment medium*.  U.S. mainstream
perception of that medium, though denegrates the medium for people who are
not appreciative, or purveyors, of comics.
