Not being a caster type myself (for the most part), I'll try to answer a few
questions from my point of view:
>>>SNIP<<<

>>I thought maybe it's because my characters arent high level so they dont
have anything to offer<<

I would say your lucky on this part, I usually get inspected, then asked if
I have any leftover equipment. My usual response is:
"sorry, all I have is what I'm wearing" ... which is when they usually ask
for plat

>>>SNIP<<<

>> when i began the game i didnt see a problem for asking for SoW at the
gates or tunnel but after reading how despised such behaviour was i havent
asked since.<<

Again, this is from a warrior's view, but from talking to my friends, it's
all in the asking. Which person would you SoW?

"d00d, sow plz"
"excuse me M'lord/M'lady, would you be so kind as to SoW me? I'm willing to
donate."

NOTE: always offer to donate. Even if they tell you they don't want the
donation, it shows you're not a beggar, because beggars would never
voluntarily part with "hard earned plat".

 >>>SNIP<<<

>>because after reading about it here im too scared to ask a passing druid
in case he screams "Buff beggars like you have ruined your own land blah
blah" in my face and i get a reputation.<<

see above response.

>> Ive done corpse runs from nektolous to kithicor many times when a simple
sow would have been a god send but im not allowed to ask right? if i ask im
scum.<<

no, if your naked and state your case (may I please get a SoW for a CR?)
you'll usually receive it. Usually.

>>how the fuck do i earn a sow? dance a scottish jig?<<

Can you dance a scottish jig? I'd pay to see that.

>>>SNIP<<<

>>but i believe the whole "Can i have SoW please?"  "yea sure type /d so i
can wipe you out" is way over the top.<<

"One rotten apple spoils the whole bunch". People tend to look at everyone
shady once they've been overrun by beggars. Unfortunately, this hurts good
intentioned people like us. Just remember these guidelines to keep you off
the beggar list:

Ask nicely, in character if possible.
Always offer a donation.
If turned down, bow and say thank you.
If given a Sow, bow and say thank you.
Remember: Druids are not the only people who can Sow. So can Rangers and
Shamans.

Did I just give away a trade secret?
