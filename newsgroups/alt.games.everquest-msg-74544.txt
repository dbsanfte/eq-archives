Screw that and buy a velium axe or short/long sword, magic and better ratio,
not like anyone even ever keeps those mino axes and I've never even heard of
a "dwarven axe" - basic velium weapon of any sort should never cost more
than 10-15pp (and if you're brave enough to run out to the Thurgadin area
you might find one rotting on the ground, or at least be able to buy one hot
off the presses for no more than 5pp since thats all they sell for and most
people in the area don't mind helping a newbie out a bit (just ignore the
assholes).
