We just raided the Hole yesterday. Sadly, we ran out of time just short
of the Undead tower, but we did knock off Jaelid the Insane (or whatever
his name is.... Ranger epic guy, about level 55ish.) I understand he's
roughly on par with High Scale Kirn (who we had also planned to take
down.) We were already fighting most of the same type mobs you hit in
the tower on the way in. We had five groups of primarily *low* fifties,
and it seemed like serious overkill, particularly if you're well
organized. I'd say four would do it handily. I was researching it ahead
of time, and read about people saying they did it with one or two
groups, but they seemed to be more in the 57-60 category, so you'd
likely want more.
