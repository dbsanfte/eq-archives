Hi all, I'm currently playing my first EQ character, a level 16 Rogue, and
have kicked and scratched my way to this point all alone. I've avoided
groups because, quite frankly, I don't know exactly what is expected of me
in a group situation. (Dumb, I know, but at least honest.)

  Anyway, I finally joined a small group the other night (lvl 18 warrior and
14 cleric), and off we went to kill things. We ended up at one of the Orc
camps in the Commons, and it all went downhill from there. My understanding,
limited as it is, was that the cleric couldn't take much damage and so
needed to be protected while he kept the warrior and I healthy.
  We ended up getting slaughtered, at least the cleric and I did, because
the warrior was looting everything as soon as he killed it, and I couldn't
keep everything off of the cleric. I ended up just backstabbing everything
that jumped on the cleric, then fighting it as it turned on me, but that
didn't last long.
  The cleric died, I died shortly afterwards, and the warrior (grrrrr)
immediately asked us both to group again. I declined, and haven't tried the
grouping thing again since then.

  My question is: What is a low-level rogue's place in a small group? What
am I supposed to be doing to help everyone out? Sorry to sound like such  a
git, but I'm still pretty new and clueless.

  TIA for any help or advice.
