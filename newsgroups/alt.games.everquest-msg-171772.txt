Americans gathered to ring in 2003 at New Year's Eve celebrations that, =
in keeping with the times, were cost-conscious and security-aware.
In New York, revelers packed midtown Manhattan to watch the gleaming =
Times Square ball drop.

The Times Square 2003 Balloon Crew blew up 10,000 red balloons to hand =
out to revelers, and a blizzard's worth of red, white and blue confetti =
was stockpiled on roofs.

that sounds like a good tool of conformity, for everyone to have a red =
balloon.

But police also welded manholes shut and removed mailboxes from Times =
Square, and said undercover officers would mix with the crowd, expected =
to exceed 500,000.

Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said about 2,000 officers would be on =
duty, with sharpshooters stationed on roofs, and that security would be =
heightened at New York Harbor.

The Department of Homeland Security issued a low-level alert for New =
York's ports earlier in the day, saying an intelligence source had =
warned of eight ``diversionary'' attacks throughout the state before a =
possible harbor attack.

yeah, i'm sure.

In a New Year message, President Bush called on Americans to focus on =
the challenges and opportunities of the year ahead and to work to keep =
the nation ``a land of justice, liberty and tolerance.''

Bush said 2002 has been a time of achievement, progress and renewed =
hope.

In some cases, celebrations were scaled back or canceled because of the =
shaky economy.

In Mobile, Ala., fireworks were dropped from the First Night celebration =
after last year's $160,000 budget was trimmed to less than $100,000.

``We will continue our efforts to secure America, win the war on =
terrorism, focus on education, promote compassion, create new jobs and =
assure the economic security of all our citizens,'' the president said =
from Crawford, Texas, where he is spending the holiday.

In Boston, authorities heightened security for the estimated 1 million =
people at the downtown First Night celebration, a mix of arts shows and =
exhibits punctuated with fireworks and a procession along Boylston =
Street.

Several communities put their own spins on New York's ball-dropping. =
Pennsylvania alone was to see a 9-foot wooden lollipop dropped in =
Hummelstown, a 100-pound slab of bologna lowered in Lebanon and a giant =
green pickle mascot taking a plunge into a barrel in Dillsburg.

The ball goes up, not down, at the Stratosphere hotel-casino in Las =
Vegas, where an estimated 270,000 tourists had flocked for the =
festivities.

In some cases, celebrations were scaled back or canceled because of the =
shaky economy.

In Mobile, Ala., fireworks were dropped from the First Night celebration =
after last year's $160,000 budget was trimmed to less than $100,000.

First Night parties were set up in 139 cities this year, 21 fewer than =
last year, said Naima Kradjian, president of First Night International.

what the hell is a First Night party? The First night of the =
Anti-christ's reign of terror on Earth?

Around the world, revelers and police flooded the streets of Paris, =
Israelis crowded into Tel Aviv clubs and U.S. sailors ``picnicked'' in =
the Persian Gulf on Tuesday, giving a warm welcome to the New Year =
despite the tightened security brought on by the specter of war or =
terrorism.

Fears of terrorism were borne out in the southern Philippines, where a =
bomb ripped through a market before midnight. The death toll rose to 10 =
early today with the deaths of three of the 30 who were injured.

In Italy on Tuesday, security was stepped up at the Vatican, at airports =
and at the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Rome. Pope John Paul II ended =
the year with a traditional New Year's Eve homily.

I wonder what the Pope's New Year's Eve homily was?=20

Unlike many European capitals, London planned no New Year's Eve =
spectacles, forcing those wishing to mark the holiday to do it in =
private.

What does that mean?

Scotland Yard put 2,000 officers on London's streets. People out in =
large groups were warned to be vigilant.

Despite sub-zero temperatures across much of Russia, vast crowds =
thronged Moscow's Red Square. Police presence was high after terrorist =
attacks on a Moscow theater in October and the Kremlin-backed =
administration in Chechnya at the end of the year.

In Australia, one of the globe's first places to greet 2003, the cleanup =
was well under way from a night of celebration.

In Sydney hours earlier, 450,000 people watched blazing fireworks on =
Sydney Harbor Bridge that ended with the image of a dove carrying an =
olive branch and the word ``PEACE.''

Peace...sniff...ok I'll just let you do whatever you want to me and I =
won't fight back so we can have PEACE.
