The main problem you are facing is that the industry as a general rule 
doesn't want you copying your VCR videos onto DVD- they want you to go 
buy DVDs. Therefore most home equipment that has VCR and DVD player in 
one will not allow you to record from one side to the other.

You may have luck with hooking up a separate VCR to a DVD recording 
machine, but I'm not familiar with home DVD recorders.
