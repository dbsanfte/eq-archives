For suitably large values of "few" :)

There are two kinds of guilds in EQ. The first kind is based upon the
class you've chosen to play. You play a druid, and therefore are a
member of the druid guild. This means that you can train up new skill
points at various druid guilds around the world.

The other kind of guild is a player guild. These are started by groups
of players for any variety of reasons. You join one of these by being
invited by an officer of the guild. Requirements and expectations vary
from one guild to the next. In general, membership in a player guild
means you've got a large group of people with whom you are likely to
be able to group with or hang out with, etc.

*Most* spells can be purchased. Some of the higher level spells are
only dropped off monsters (you won't have to worry about these for a
long time), and for some classes certain spells can only be gotten
through researching them (as a druid, you needn't worry about this).

And rarely, there are spells that can only be gotten through questing.
The one that you might care about as a druid is called "charm plants",
but it's essentially worthless. A fun quest, though.

Yes.

Once you get the meditate skill, turning this button on will, as you
guessed, improve your mana regeneration rate.

It depends what you find yourself doing most. As you approach the
higher levels, pay attention to the kinds of spells you cast the most.
Whatever specialty they use is likely the one you'll want to focus on.

Using the Brewing skill, they can be turned into Acorn Oil, which is
used to tailor Halfling cultural armor.

Not at all - several of my characters have been avid fisher persons.
You'll find, though, that as you gain levels your forage skill will
become far more useful and easier than fishing, and it doesn't cost
anything to use.
