I think part of it was they just tossed in a couple of nerfs. Two of which
fixed what were basically exploits. Exploits we beta testers asked them to
fix before release, but which likely got lost in the 'is it critical or not'
shuffle. As we were exiting beta they tried to slow the game waaay down. So
you couldn't master Architect (for example) in a month. they want it to take
3. Heck, I don't think the game's been out a month yet has it? I saw a
Master Ranger the other day.
