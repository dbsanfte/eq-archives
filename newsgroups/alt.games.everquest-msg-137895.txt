Anyone else getting crazy exp after the last patch?  I logged on with my Lvl
47 Bard (about 90% through the level) and figured I'd solo for about 10-15
kills to get to 48.  I was there in 4.  Solo'd a few more and got a whole
bub within 1/2 hour.  Logged onto my 18 Necro and same thing happened.
I'm not bitching, believe me, I'm just wondering if anyone else is having
this happen.

SEAN...
