your talking about things you have no idea about dude.

What they actually did was add a few shimmering rockfiends to the zone,
"super MR - ae groups are dead!!"
They can be solod by a caster easily.

The grey is a great AE zone, heck a druid can root dot seven mobs with EASE
around the temple (root/dot isnt as effective as ae's either)

When you handle a 25+ mob pull in Sebilis and see a screen like: -

You have gained party experience!
You have gained party experience!
You have gained party experience!
You crush AMob for 92
You have gained party experience!
You have gained party experience!
You crush AMob for 70
You kick AMob for 134
You have gained party experience!
You have gained party experience!
You have gained party experience!
You have gained party experience!

Then come back and talk.  Until then your arguing about something you really
have no clue about
