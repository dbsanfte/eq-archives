Amen!  I can say, playing a Druid, I tend to run into a lot of rude
beggars..  But more and more people lately have started asking politely...
When asked, I generally SoW or buff, no compensation asked for...  And, when
camping a mob (and I know it's gonna be a while before the next placeholder
pops up), I even buff or heal or sow people who seem to be having problems,
without being asked...  But then, usually when camping, I'm pretty flipping
bored, so I welcome the opportunity to help someone else out... :)
