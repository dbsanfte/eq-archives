Ummm, is there faction attached to those spiders and statues?  If not,
there's the reasoning.

In Kael (Grobb, and Neriak), the mobs have faction.  Anyone can, in
theory raise their faction high enough to be non-KOS (true, for some
it would be incredibly tedious it might as well be impossible).

I'm not aware of any way for anyone to raise faction with Velketor the
Sorcerer.
