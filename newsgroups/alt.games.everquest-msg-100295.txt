    The original poster didn't send a direct tell, demanding a port, invis,
and private massage. The original poster auctioned for a port, and the
person who responded ported him/her to a destination other than the
destination that was requested. This is a violation of the PNP. There's no
leg to stand on here.

    Service asked for and agreed to was different from service delivered. I
see the point, sorry you miss it.

    Imagine the following scenario, since Usenet is all about analogies. You
ask a wizard for a port to GFay. They port you to Tox, tell you how to use
the Scion to get up to the Nexus and back down to GFay, then leave. The
spire in Tox is safer than the trip through Butcherblock, and easier for a
new player to manage, but I bet you'd be pissed. Because you didn't get what
you asked for.

    Again, I'll point out that the original poster didn't send a direct
tell, he/she AUCTIONED for a port. Is that so annoying that porting the
person to the wrong place is acceptable if only to shut them up?

    At what point did the druid provide a port to GFay, which is what was
asked for? Don't try and play games, answer that question. Did the druid
give the original poster what they asked for, or did the druid take money
for something that the DRUID, and NOT the original poster, thought was "good
enough"? Would you be happy if I decided, as a cleric, that a 90% res is
"good enough" without consulting you? At least now the res window tells you
exactly how much XP you get back - the port spell does no such thing.

    Looking back, I see the original poster is a troll, level 16. It doesn't
sound like the OP is a caster with SoW or Invis. If the OP had never been to
Butcherblock before, then safely getting to GFay would have been an issue.
There's low visibility, and several areas with guards that would paste a
level 16 troll in seconds. At the very least the OP would have to log, print
a map to figure out where GFay was from the druid ring, and then continue on
with caution in case something is out of position. That does NOT sound like
what he/she asked for, does it?

    Are you really this stupid? Here's the quick and easy test for "did the
druid do what was required to get the money": is the OP at the GFay spires
after the port? No? Then the druid didn't do what was asked of him. There
was no reason for the druid to respond to the request, which the druid could
not satisfy, unless the druid was stupid or a money-grubbing port whore - or
was willing to guide the troll to GFay afterwards.
