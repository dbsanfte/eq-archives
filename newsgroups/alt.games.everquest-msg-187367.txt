I don't appreciate when posters start lying about what I said in order
to score cheap "points" like it's a competition or something. James
(not John as I accidently called him for some reason above) appears to
believe he knows what I am thinking better than I do. The arrogance
given the absolute lack of evidence to support him AND several posts
pointing out why he is wrong, from several people, is amazing. That he
was never the original poster or involved in any way indicates he was
spoiling to show the WHOLE WIDE WORLD just how darn smart he was.

Well, he got slapped down for it. Time will tell if he learned any
wisdom from this.
