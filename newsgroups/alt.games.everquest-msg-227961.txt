A good bard is a joy to have in a group, even if he is not the puller.  
Bards have so much to add to a group.  Sure, there are idiots out there 
that are clueless to what a bard brings, but, that does not make them any 
less useful.  There are also bards that do just play manasong, which only 
reinforces the impressions of the idiots that think that is what they are 
for.
