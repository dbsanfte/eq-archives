OK, my numbers were probably off, for exaggeration effect. There have
been extended parses in the past showing that small (ie: armor based)
dex increases were useless, but major (spells like avatar, garou etc)
did have a slight, parsable effect. Searches on monkly-business or
safehouse fofr example, might throw up those results.

>Not seen that stated before .... any references?

Purely anecdotal ones, but definite disproval of the idea there *isn't*
a hidden 'proc rate'. If you prove there isn't one, the only logical
hypothesis is that there *is* one, given no new evidence. QED

Scim of the Mistwalker is the most famous example of something that
globally procced like heck one day, then one patch later, only proced
once per RL day. The cleric hammer is the most recent, widely seen,
example of proc rate change after a patch. Without an item-specific
variable to tweak, there seems to be no other way of doing it. It would
also account for why some weapons proc a lot more than others, all other
things being equal. No proof for there being one, but all evidence I've
seen points that way.
