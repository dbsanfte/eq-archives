SoW potions suck at level 1 :(  My little halfling tailor twink died while 
carrying some ore around in PoK and got stuck in Misty Thicket all 
encumbered.  So I used my ranger to run a SoW potion down to her (now that 
I think about it, should've just had the ranger sow her), the potion effect 
lasted about 10 minutes before wearing off :(

Just a caveat to anybody out there thinking they'll cruise around with sow 
potions that early :P
