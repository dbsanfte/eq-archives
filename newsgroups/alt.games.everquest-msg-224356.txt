Pets from a game standpoint are NPCs.  NPCs over level 55 cannot be feared.
The PoP pets are level 60, thus making them immune to fear as well as AEs
with a fear component.  Valiant companion, while once a great spell for
dragon fights, now has a shelf life of 2 levels.

P.S. - "We switched to exclusively Firebolt of Tallon (or FoTon torpedos
:)." made me laugh quite a bit.  I have never heard that phrase used before,
but I can't wait to use in in game.
