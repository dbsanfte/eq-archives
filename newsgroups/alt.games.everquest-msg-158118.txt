Well, duh.  But his question is, what's the ration of the three categories?  
I think we can mostly discount rewards for quests, maybe 1-2%.  I bet coin 
drops is a suprising percentage, probably 70%ish.  And of that, probably 
10-15% is hill giants just because everyone tells everyone asking where plat 
is from to go farm those.  Maybe another 10% for sea furbies.
