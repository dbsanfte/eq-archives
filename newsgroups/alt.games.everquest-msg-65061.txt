Yep, only the 5 spells -
Elemental Defender (summons a no rent, lore, magic sheild for the
secondary slot or back slot, AC 10, +5 Cold, Fire and Magic resist).

Summon Phantom leather/chain/plate.  (summons a bag with the 8 
visible pieces of armor.  The bag is 8slot, non-weight reducing,
holds giant sizes)

Summon Elemental Blanket - (I understand it's a shoulder slot
item with good resists).

On the plus side, Summon Phantom Plate allows you to add 99
raw ac to your pet (8 visible pieces of armor, 2 coldstones
to force one into the neck slot (+5), 2 rings of flight (+4
ea), 2 weapons, so that the Elemental defender is forced into
the backslot.

Only anecdotal, but with all that, a lesser conjuration: Fire
(level 39 spell, approx.  lvl 35 pet at best) was easily able
to tank Sarnak Knights (36-38) allowing me to be pretty patient
about letting it build aggro, drop one bolt, wait a bit, drop
the second, and boom - fleeing sarnak knight :)
