I thought they had done it yesterday.  They were taking down 
newbie zones and low level dungeons for 15minutes at a time
on lanys.

You know (obviously :)) I wasn't against the spellbook removal,
or an XP bonus in dungeons.  But increasing XP from 1-10 the
way they did is going to lead a lot of true newbies to 10
with skills lacking, poor equipment from less kills/less
loot.
