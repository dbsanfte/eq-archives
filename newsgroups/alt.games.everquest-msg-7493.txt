Not me - I'm praying that you'll just put him in your frigging kill
file and get over your fascination with him. You make some real
contributions to the group, which is why you're not in my KF, but your

accuse him of.

You want to convince people that Biz is a bad guy? You certainly won't
achieve that acting like one yourself.
