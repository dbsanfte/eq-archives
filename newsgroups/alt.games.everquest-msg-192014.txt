NPC bartenders are offering to rez people for ale?

I'm -good- for their business, not bad, where do you think 90% of those dead
people get their ale from to pay me with?

Not to mention, without my more direct support, there'd be a severe drop in
their incomes.

The customer may not be always right, but killing a cleric of Brell just
-can't- help you make money in the pub business!
