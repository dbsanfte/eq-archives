No, in fact I petitioned several such names after the sept 11 problem.
I was thanked later and told it was taken care of.

Nope, otherwise you'd never have this problem.
Only swear words, not most topical words or fantasy characters, are
censored.

First offense they'd probably just change it. If you were popping up
every other day with another Osamaben variant then you'd probably
eventually get banned. First offense for virtually anything the worst
that usually happens is a warning on your account, if even that.
