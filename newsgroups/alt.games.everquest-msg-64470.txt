Lets see so now the 95 people must spend. 80-149 bucks to upgrade to 98SE/ME
Just so they can play the game they bought that was orginaly supported in
the verson they have.  NO that is not right.  I just cant belive they did
not test across different versions of windows. As to if they should be
allowed to whine ..  yes very very much so.
