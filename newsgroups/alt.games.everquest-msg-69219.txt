  I think all that does is make it so you zone faster... it doesn't
affect actual performance in gameplay (I did try it, didn't improve
anything perceptibly).  That's my problem... at times it is literally
looking like a slideshow... and we're not talking SoL or even Kunark
zones here... I'm talking the gates of East Freeport. :\  With all
display preferences set to their absolute minimums.  Before December
4th, though I sometimes experienced poor frame rates, it was almost
always playable, even in graphics intense zones like Warsliks.  Now I
can't even walk through simple zones.

  Yeah, maybe.  And I know that EQ was starting to look dated,
however, I'm willing to tolerate the dated look if it means I can
play.  Right now, for me, the game is unplayable, and that's REALLY
beginning to try my patience, considering the fact that in the past
two months, I've done over $120 worth of upgrades to my computer, and
previous to these upgrades, I had tolerable/good performance in EQ.
After December 4th, even with the upgrades, the performance is sucking
hard.

  I agree that in the long run, all of this is a great thing for EQ.
I know that eventually they'll probably get everything working and
we'll have a better game for it, but I just wish they hadn't rushed.
I think most of Verant's customers would appreciate it more if they'd
have waited a month or two to release Luclin if it meant a smoother
release than what we experienced.  They wouldn't have met their
pre-Christmas deadline, but a lot of their player would probably have
a much higher opinion of Verant's customer service than they now do.
