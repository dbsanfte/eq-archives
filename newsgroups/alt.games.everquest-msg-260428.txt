those items are summoned by magicians.  i've never done this myself, but i
have heard about magicians that team up with a chanter to charm some low
level mobs, then the magician summons the armor and weapons and gives them
to the mob to make it harder to kill.  then they gate out or something to
break the charm without getting aggro.  that way, the next person who comes
to fight the mob will find that it is much harder to kill than they
expected.  i think this is just done by mischievous mages who want to make
life hard for the newbs.
