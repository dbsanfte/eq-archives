Well, I think it really comes down to knowing the mobs and taking
care to have the right spells mem'd.  Once you've got Alliance:US
(not sure where it drops, found my copy on a vendor) it's really
pretty easy to deal with most guards on that faction, though you
have to be careful, lots of popular twink gear seems to have
hidden negative faction modifiers.  It's true that some locals and
vendors are on multiple factions, but once you know which gear to
avoid you can get almost all of them to indifferent or better.
OTOH, I have never been able to find a copy of Alliance:Parisian
anywhere.  And while the usual techniques seem to work ok on the
gendarmes and the rural populace (most of the Normandy zone cons
amiable to Americans, for example) it can be unpleasant at times
in the high traffic zones.  YMMV.
