I agree with you on both counts . Regeneration should be a sliding scale
based on stamina for both hps and mana that is directly tied to total amount
. It should take no more than 2 minutes while "resting".

I much prefer how the original moria did experience . Base experience for
mob multiplied by level of mob/level of character. This results in low level
mobs giving so little experience as to be negligible. It is also fairly easy
to adapt to a group.
