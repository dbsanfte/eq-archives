This is incorrect . The boots you get for turning in tormaxes head to
yelinak are flowing thought 2 . There are also some other flowing thought 2
items , but tormax is the easiest . ( I dont believe I just said that
*winces*)

The int equals the wisdom on all of the shawls . Oddly enough the int
casters get a much greater increase in utility from the shawls the wis
casters do . AC factors in as a highly important characteristic and the
shawls are particularly low in ac for clerics and somewhat low for shamans.
