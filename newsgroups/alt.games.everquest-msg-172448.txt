Your body will not decompose for quite a while-a week I think-so you should
have plenty of time to get to it before it poofs.

If you have the Planes of Power expansion you can travel faster to a number
of destinations.  Also Shadows of Luclin allows you easier access to some
zones.  If you do not have those expansions the only other fast way to
travel is to get a gate or port from a Druid or Wizard.  Sometime they will
gate you for free, but usually the cost is a minimum of 20pp.  That is a lot
for a newbie, so you will probably be running a lot.  You can also try
bumming a sow (Spirit of Wolf) to at least speed up the pace of running.

The price you are seeing on the Fine Steel is from a merchant.  No one ever
pays those prices and there are very few items that are even close to being
worth what the merchants price them at.  You will want to buy a weapon from
another player instead, or loot one from a MOB.

You can tell how good a weapon is by right clicking on it and holding down
the button.  It will display a box with information about the weapon.  The
Damage is the base damage the weapon can do (other factors contribute to the
actual damage you do with it but I don't know how that works) and the Delay
is how often you will hit.  Therefore, the lower the delay, the more often
you will hit, and the higher the damage, the more damage you will do.  So
you want a weapon that has a low delay and a high damage.  One compared to
the other is called the damage ratio.

The Fine Steel may not do more damage, but you may be hitting more often,
however, Fine Steel is still not a very good weapon and you will want to
invest in a better weapon as soon as you can afford one.
