I *think* what he means, and I could be wrong, is the idea of exploiting a
building if a mob could not hit through it. It is a "trick" that would be
easily exploited if buildings were ever made to be "solid objects" to
monsters.

Think about it. You're a level 9 hunting in East Commons. You see a Griff,
very red to you, but you're near an inn so you take a whack at it. Hit it a
few times till your health drops a bit low, step inside an inn. Instant safe
zone, with the mob still outside waiting to get at you. Buy a few bandages,
or heal yourself in safety, whatever. Step back outside, whack it a few
times, rinse, repeat.

It would also mean any zone with a building in it - which means any outdoor
zone in the game, pretty much - has a built in "safe" spot where you could
med, rest, fletch and plays gems without fear.

Mind you, that's not a bad thing in my book. What the hell is an inn for if
not for a place to rest in relative peace? But I can see how that could be
exploited to take down mobs you shouldn't be able to, or to sprint through
zones you have no business in, running for each safe "checkpoint" and
shouting for the higher levels to come clear the beastie for you before you
make your next run.
