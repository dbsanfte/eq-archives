It does seem to be difficult to get the original game from anywhere in the
UK at the moment so mail order is probably the easiest option.

And yes, Antonius Bayle is the UK server. There is no problem whatsoever
playing on the other servers, but the UK is a little bit less prone to lag
for
us people in the UK, and you are more likely to find more people logged
on at the same time. (Not that it's usually a problem on the other servers)
