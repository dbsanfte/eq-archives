I *think* i may have some more info for you.  As far as I can tell, if
someone does not put characters in front of the link i can see the link just
fine.  If someone types in front of the link then i see the numbers as well.
I've tested this with some RL friends and 100% of the time if they don't
type anything the link works, but if they type something then the link does
not work.  Also, typing after the link had no effect either way.

I don't know if this will lead to a way to view people that have typed in
front of links but hopefully that helps a little.
