I've seen pets not weild weapons like some of the really high damage 
things that drop in FM but that have large races only tags on them.  Its 
much harder, though, to tell if they are using armor; the only way I 
could think of to experiement would be to give a really low level pet a 
lot of AC off armor of a certain sort, and compare how hard it gets hit 
over a long run of combats to how hard it gets hit with no AC.

You could try it with higher level pets, but I'd think it would show the 
most with a little guy, where adding 100AC might double the thing's AC 
level.
