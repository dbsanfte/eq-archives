Ive been playing eq constantly since november and have enjoyed lag
free performance until the last 4 weeks where the lag has been unbearable
My isp claims there is a router problem somewhere in the states but 4 weeks
is
a bit hard to take
I pay through the nose for my cable connection and really feel llike pulling
it out the
wall
Are there any other aussie EQ players out there experiencing the same
problems as me
I would really like to here from you
