Since PoP came out our guild is growing stronger each day.
We can now group in Seb or Umbral without those high end guilds get in our
way.
And yes we are a mixed european-american guild so that has some benifits.
Also grouping in the entrance place of the first Tier planes is awesome for
us.
We now meet other guilds that want to raid or group with us.. We have now a
steady 40-60 player base with more 50+ invited weekly. PoP has no effect on
us.
