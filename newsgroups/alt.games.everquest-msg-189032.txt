Well getting people up for killing the thought horror overfiend on
TEST would be a bit of a challenge, especially since I'm not in any of
the raiding guilds there.

On the other hand, after a marathon 32 hour session which ended in my
druid tracker getting killed by the only kos mob on gnome island
because I fell asleep, the wait for stormfeather is over. Now just the
two easy parts to go.
