Yeah, stuff gone etc. What I find works best is to decide loot, work
it out, do it fast and have anyone who won some and looted CAMP RIGHT
NOW. I mean like, you loot, say "THANKS ALL BRB." camp right then.
That is the only way to keep something if the server crashes. 9 times
out of 10 if you camp right after looting you'll have it. If you loot
and the server crashes, even if you zone once, you might not.

You don't say if you have time but that is a pretty good policy. My
guild never had that policy but I always did it as a matter of course.
No idea if they thought it was funny but I did not care. Usually no
one notices or cares that you were gone for 35 seconds.
