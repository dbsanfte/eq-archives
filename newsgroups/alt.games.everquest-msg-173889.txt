	It would depend entirely on who they were shooting.

	We *are* trying to stop them.  You stop terrorists by killing them and
those who support them. *THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION*.  You CANNOT appease them.
Once terrorism has been employed, all possibility of negotiation or compromise
is GONE.

|American peace, as in world peace enforced by the US under its terms.
|That's not a happy thought.

	Not something I'm in favor of either, which is why I like overwhelming
retaliation.  You touch us, you pull back a bloody stump with no body
attached.
