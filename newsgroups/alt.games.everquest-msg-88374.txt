Read up on the class at:
www.eqdiva.com
eq.castersrealm.com

First off Bards are NOT a melee class. They are not equiped (HPs, AC,
Melee Skills) to stand toe-to-toe with mobs once they hit the
mid-levels. 

Bards are 80%caster 20%melee. 

It is a very fun and rewarding class to play, but it requires a LOT of
concentration and button/mouse-clicking.
