Benefits:
- Main one: looks cool
- In Unrest you're no longer KOS, so go explore!
- depending on your race you may not care but the 2nd one gives you
infravision and the 3rd ultravision
- MAY increase running speed, but you'll never notice.  I've never had a
problem keeping up with friends in wolf with me not...even across WK

According to castersrealm.com, SoW increases running speed up to 55%.  Form
of the Great Wolf, 60%...not a difference you're going to notice. Levels 54
& 60 wolf you probably would notice the difference (level 60 is 70%).

- SoW lasts 36 mins...Wolf form (depending on which level) lasts 1:12 to
2:24 hours

Drawbacks:
- KOS by pretty much every NPC on Kunark.  Velious ain't much better...don't
know about Luclin but I wouldn't chance it.
- Forgetting to dump it and sow yourself before going inside is annoying
(illusion drops upon zoning).
