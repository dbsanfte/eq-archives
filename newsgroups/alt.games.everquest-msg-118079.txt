Ok. I have no point to this post, specifically, except to say that in
one of the *worst* Hate raids ever, (tried a different route in and had
three full and two partial wipeouts) I won the roll on a pair of
indicolite boots.  I've never gotten a drop there before, and I was
still wearing crafted boots at 55. 

So I guess I'm kind of happy. Errr.... sort of. I mean the boots are
nothing to write home about, what with so much better being available in
the game. Hell, I think the Thurg quest boots are a significant step up.
But it was just nice to win something, ya know?
;-)
