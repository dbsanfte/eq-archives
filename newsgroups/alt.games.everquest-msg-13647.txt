Thank you! That comes about as close as I've seen to a rationale
explanation for why they would deem certain things exploits and not
others.  Of course, I still think that all across Norrath we'll come in
contanct with thousands of similar scenarios, and each one will be on a
case by case basis.  Not only terrain/pathing questions, but tactics as
well.  Has Verant come out and said whether killing your fighters first
and having them fight the warder under rez effects was an "exploit"? I'm
not sure from the official responses thus far. Sounds like good tactics
to me, avoiding a 70% slow spell. And if the tanks die in the course of
the battle and can be rezzed down there quickly enough to jump back into
the fight, *that's* surely not an exploit, is it? The list will be
endless and we can only wait and see how it turns out.
