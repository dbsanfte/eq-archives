Oh come now, it probably doesn't matter much, but the races do differ, 
not just in stats (which really don't matter much) but in special 
abilities; and often those matter more at low levels than elsewhere in 
the game.

For example, if you need a rogue in order to drag a body, you can make a 
halfling and get hide and sneak at 50 each, usuable at level one; even 
if you intend to level him up a bit for some reason, you'll have a 50 
point head start on those two annoying to raise skills.

For many classes, race is the only way to get hide or sneak at all, and 
again its at low levels that these are the most useful.

I did end up getting a Lammy, no haste item at all though, cause I 
picked up an Ikky chestplate instead for the regen; +5 hp a tic is 
astonishing at low levels.  Didn't think about haste till I'd already 
blown most of my budget on the regen... I was surprised to see that I 
could have picked up  21% haste on an earring for 5kpp.

Hmm, forgot thats how the potions work.  Well, 1 DS wouldn't be 
noticable really, as overpowered as a Lammy is in a level 1's hands, and 
the duration is mighty short for such small effect.

I've used COE before and its an excellent lowbie buff, long duration, 
very effective.

  I don't even know if they exist, and they might well scale with level 
for all I know, which would make them fairly useless.

But SLN has an HP regen component.  I'm a huge believer in HP regen for 
melee's.  HP just controls how long you can go between heals, HP regen 
controls that plus how long the time to heal takes.

Yep, just about every point went into Track, its annoying to raise 
because there's no way (as far as I know) to automatically close the 
track window, so I can't just tie Track button to a turn arrow and 
forget about it when I don't really care whats nearby.

His combat skills all went up fine, didn't keep pace with level because 
he leveled so fast, but were good enough to keep killing things with.

I may end up playing him on and off, just because I've found in the past 
that having a pocket tracker I can swap in to find things with can be 
handy, and also because sometimes I only have short time periods to play 
in, and in my 50s that sort of play time ends up being fairly ineffective.
