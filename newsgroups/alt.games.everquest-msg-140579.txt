You couldnt' be more wrong.

I said I was lazy.  What on Norrath would make me check even
one Trader for his wares?  I use the bazaar search function with
glee.

I never ever use /auction now that bazaar is in the game.  Again,
I'm far too lazy to waste my time spamming actions that noone
is even going to read.

I don't set outrageous prices, I set them generally low, but
not trying to be lowest, as I feel the lowest priced items will
sell out quick, and I'll make my sales eventually when mine
become lowest.  I -could- lowball everyone else and make
a faster but smaller buck... but frankly I"m too lazy!

Thus far I've not put one item up for sale that I cared whether
it sold or not.  So I'm quite immune to the desperation you
picture.  What I appreciate about the bazaar function is
quite the opposite, gradually the crap I have in the bank,
and things I loot, turn into cash while I'm asleep IRL,
literally 100 times as much cash as I"d have gotten from
selling them to vendors, on average.  I don't even look
at what sold, just juggle in more of whatever I have
handy so I always have 30 items up when I go to bed
again.

You picture a driven, desperate, but essentially foolish
merchant, when in fact, I'm a lazy, slobbish adventurer
who's found a simple way to turn a nice profit, and
isn't about to clutter up that simplicity spending a half
hour a night checking prices on every item to see
what the competion is asking right now.  Perhaps I
could be making twice as much as I am now.  Perhaps I
could be making less, but faster.  I just don't care
all that much!  Wise?  I think so, since this enables me
to spend my time online playing around having fun,
instead of standing around worrying over every last copper.
