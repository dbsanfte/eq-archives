Actually, it would appear this is no longer a "worth while" quest on my
server, though, any twink bloated server would probably consider it just the
same.

I have recently took a guildie to his spawn spot, only to find that he was
there (second time Dyllin was just there waiting for his next murderer to
show), though I found out this particular time by him screaming his
profanities of hate and discontent in my name.  Being the type that doesnt
care for NPC's to get in my face and scream at me, I proceeded to whop his
candy ass, afterwhich of course my guildie gladly looted the page.

Granted the Wildfire was a bit of overkill, however, I just did not expect
to be confronting him, though as stated above, it seems no one or atleast
not nearly as many people are interested in this quest any longer.

It kinda chokes me up a bit and almost compells me to give 1kpp to all the
REAL "newbies" of EQ that show up on our server.. just so that they will
"fit in."  <grin>
