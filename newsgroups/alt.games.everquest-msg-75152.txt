DAOC doesn't have teleport, and EQ doesn't charge for binds in more places
than DAOC (since in DAOC you can only bind in certain towns).  Spells in
DAOC are free but it was never too much of a burden in EQ.

There's a big underlying story about Norrath & Luclin too, but you never
looked for it.

Couple easy questions:  Why are you trying to reach your next level?  What
are you looking forward to 5 levels from now?  Ten?

I mean, besides RvR.  You can't use that reason because almost EVERYONE is
looking forward to that...name something else you're looking forward to in
DAOC.
