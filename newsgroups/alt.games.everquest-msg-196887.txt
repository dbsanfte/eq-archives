I would have merely informed him that he was mistaken, and that I had been 
there for 3 hours and therefore had no reason to leave. Common courtesy 
would dictate that you not force your way into another's camp, but it sure 
doesn't sound like that was the case, on your part anyway.

If he resorted to training or KS'ing you, immediately /petition a GM and 
continue what you are doing. It usually takes them a while to respond, 
though I've had pretty decent luck with them lately - 30 min. to an hour or 
so.

Additionally, if his guild is worth a crap, they would be interested in his 
actions here. If they blow you off, then screw 'em. What do you care about 
"making an enemy" like that - though I'm not quite sure what that means.
