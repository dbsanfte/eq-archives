The classes that could solo well before KEI, still can. The classes
that had a harder time soloing before KEI will have a harder time now.

EQ has a LONG history of encouraging grouping by "nerfing" soloing.
Yet still people keep playing. I really don't think the KEI-fix will
drive that many people away from EQ. At worst it will drive more
towards the traditional solo classes, and away from the less optimal
choices.
