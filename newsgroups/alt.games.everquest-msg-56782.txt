Iceclad can be dangerous.

Great Divide isn't very dangerous, but don't go afk during the port.

Wakening Lands is very close to being safe IF YOU ARE NO LONGER KOS TO CoV
FACTION.  If you have not actively worked on dragon faction while hunting in
Velious (giants & dire wolves) then if Wuoshi the dragon is up in WL you
will almost certainly die.

Cobalt Scar is, I believe, VERY safe if you have the needed CoV faction
(same as WL).

Get into the habit of calling the teeth by their proper word..."teeth" (or
"tooth").  Reason being, to get from Skyshrine to Cobalt Scar you need the
CS KEY.  To port directly to CS you need the CS TOOTH.  They're two totally
different things.

In answer to your question later in the thread, if you don't have a
sufficient tooth but you try to port someone to that location anyway, they
will go and you will stay.  If you're doing it for money make sure they pay
up front. <g>

CAUTION:  If you do the preceding paragraph make note that when you do the
"druid translocation" method you will probably immediately move to a
different place in your present zone.   Added to that is the very real
possiblity that you won't be able to do anything beyond moving until you
either zone (from what I hear, I haven't tried this) or /q out.   Dreadlands
is like that.
