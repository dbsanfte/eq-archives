I agree, having just spent all day making unfired (unstackable) ceramic
linings, processing them into fired ones, then processing that into
casserole dishes... and only got 1 skill increase (184-185) despite 255
wisdom. Aaaaaargh. No wonder macro programs are so popular. I am sooo
looking forward to this possible improvement. Now if only they made a vendor
selling frost turnips so brewing skillups could be pain free too!!
