I'm a beta tester who has 256k DSL. Looking at screenshots, I figured
that I would have to upgrade to a higher service level.  I can happily
report that I am very impressed with the FPS over my 256 connection. 
Other than a recent period due to a bad patch, the framerate has been
smooth as butter with graphic options turned very high.

My concern now is whether this will be true when the retail product is
available and players nation-wide are logging in en-masse.  My worries
will probably not be realized since more servers will be available. 
Currently, there are only 3 supporting the Beta community.  I am
impressed.
