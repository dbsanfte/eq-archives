But of course that is not what I wanted and so not what I did.  If you
want to pretend I said something, then of course in your mind that will
be what I said, but you must remember, only because you are pretending
and only in your mind.  Reality does not change based on what you think,
only your perception of it.

In response I would like to say Oklahoma!Oklahoma!Oklahoma!  A game is
what it is and to make it something else makes it something else.  Yes,
those of us who are programmers can surely build code that will
intercept and interpret packets from the data stream and based on info
contained therein generate data to send to the server in such a manner
as to actively hunt down and kill mobs unattended.  The result is not
gaming.  The very fact that you can't see the difference between playing
a game and engaging in data based masturbation is something I find
amusing, but then again my sense of humor leans towards the absurd.

No apology needed, I am offended by neither your ignorance nor your
arrogance.  The fact that you or others do not agree with me has no
bearing on the facts or my understanding of them.  Perhaps in your world
validation from others or a majority of others is a necessity.  I for
one don't need someone like you to prove to me that there are folks like
that in the world or folks that don't see anything wrong with all sorts
of things I consider wrong.  They and you are entitled to believe what
you will, I am entitled to my opinions in response.  Now run along and
stroke your data, just be careful of growing hair on your Palm.
