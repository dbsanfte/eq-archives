No, America is NOT the greedy one.  Yes, we do produce things, but we also
produce them for the world.  It's not as though the USA are the only ones
who benefit from our industrial machine. 
Do you like your computer?  Thank American industry's Bell Labs for making
the transistor and Fairchild for developing the microchip out of that.
Otherwise your computer would be made out of vacuum tubes and take up your
entire house.  Oh, wait... Vacuum tubes were invented by Thomas Edison, so
you wouldn't even have that.

This nation here produces things that help the environment.  Need clean,
cheap electricity?  Right now the best way is Nuclear Power, thanks to
American industry.  Who led the world into cleaner burning unleaded gas
to clean up the environment?  America again, helping the whole world.  
Who's leading the technology to produce workable Hydrogen Fuel Cells for
the cleanest power source ever conceived?  Yup, that's the USA.

This nation's industry has done more, and is doing more, to clean up the
air and water than any ten other nations, and it's sheer insanity to
hogtie industry which is doing such good and wonderful things for the
whole planet.  Not just the USA, but everyone in the world benefits from
American industry and it's contributions towards a greener Earth.

Think about the Internet and it's USA origins next time you fire off an
e-mail without using any paper at all.  America just saved a bunch of
trees for environmentalist wackos to hug with that one industrial
invention.

If it's greed causing all of these things to clean up the world, then
by all means, bring on the greed and tear up that idiotic Kyoto treaty.
Industry (especially US industry) has been cleaning up the world and
raising the quality of life for decades now, something no government
can claim, so governments should get that treaty out of industry's
face now and forevermore.

There's more than a little truth to that.  We just had the World
Health Organization tell us that the United States isn't doing
enough about the AIDS epidemic in Africa.  What the hell?  Is that
OUR fault that people are dying in Africa?  We do provide a lot of
assistance already, but we don't owe anybody anything as a nation.
Every favor done us has been more than repaid.  France helped the
USA against the crummy Brits during our revolution, but they'd be
goose-stepping and speaking German by now if the USA hadn't helped
them out in WWII.  When disaster strikes in foreign lands, the USA
is right up front offering aid.  I live less than a 2-hour drive
from a National Disaster Area, proclaimed as such by our own
President Bush.  Over $1.2 Billion in damage from the Rodeo fire
here in Arizona, and is any foreign nation offering any kind of
help to US?  Not only no, but HELL no.  When the USA gets hurt,
we're supposed to lick our own wounds and carry on without complaint.

It's more than a little one-sided, in my estimation.
