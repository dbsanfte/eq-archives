My guess would be bard; a lot of people start bards, but drop out by the time
they get into their 20s; the class requires a lot of work, and the rewards
come up in the high 20s and again in the high 30s, and aren't easy to cash in,
they require even more work but become massively powerful if used well.

I'll add, though, that the "least common" class changes every time there's a
patch; monks have plummetted rapidly since the big nerf a while back, once one
of the more popular classes out there.
