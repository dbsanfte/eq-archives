I don't know enough about dual wield to be sure here, but I would think that
you would be better off swapping your weapons.  Reason being, any damage
bonus you add onto the base damage of the weapon would occur with a delay of
18 with the mace, or a delay of 26 with the boneshard.  Since both weapons
are otherwise equivalent, ie ratio of 1dam/2dly, then you want to maximize
damage with the lower delay weapon, as you get to add your damage bonus(es)
more often.  Now, if you get the same damage bonus(es) in both the primary,
and secondary slots, then ignore the advice, as I said, I really don't know
how dual wield works, don't have a character with it yet.
