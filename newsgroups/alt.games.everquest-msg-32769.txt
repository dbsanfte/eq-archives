I live in Denmark and have the same problems. Its kinda hard to be on a raid
that goes on till 8 AM my time.
On Veeshan there is 1 (not counting guilds with under 20 people) guild that is
mainly europeans. but unfortunately theyre composed of 50% assholes, 45%
children with behaviour problems, and 5% ok people.
Almost every time some of the worst idiots in IllOmen will name his guilds
(guilds, maybe to pretend this char is his main in all the guilds and then get
better stuff on raids, who knows), he is a member of Valhall.

It a shame, since i could really use a guild who plays on my time, but ill
rather stick to my own good guild since just being in Valhall automatically give
you a bad rep (know of 5 guilds who will not group with or in any way help
people from Valhall).

But keep on looking, i hope youre more lucky than i am on my server.
