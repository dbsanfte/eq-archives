We did the greater lightstone quest at the gypsy camp:) 
I was shocked when I ran into a building for cover and a griffawn followed me
in.  And the bartender didn't even help me!
I was *devastated* when I ran up to a farm house in West Commons and got killed
by the bandits.  And all I wanted was directions because I was lost!!  I never
did find my corpse with my coveted leather tunic and fine steel sword.
I still love the huge empty expanses in North and West Karana.....
