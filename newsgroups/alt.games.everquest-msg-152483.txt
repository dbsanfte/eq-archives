Many wind instruments are bugged, they perform fine
as instruments, but do not train the skill.  Your
safest bet is to use the plain old storebought
flute out of your guild, since after all you aren't trying
to do anything in particular with it, the stats or better
percent improvements you might find on other
instruments aren't going to matter when you are sitting
quietly at the bottom of a pond somewhere playing
afk flautist.

same way
