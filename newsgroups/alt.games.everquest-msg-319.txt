I currently have a druid that I have gotten to level 31.  For the most part,
I am still in leatherwear with the exception of a lockjaw vest and a savant
cap.  Any advice from others on the druidwear I should be shopping for?  I
am looking for wisdom items, but also trying keep AC as high as possible.
For the most part I try to avoid melee, but everyone now and then gotta
swing the ole mace!

Thanks
Stasis
