Interesting, no wonder there's been so little bitching coming from
the Druid ranks recently.  This is contrary to the way they said it
would work, but their advance pronouncements are often at odds with
what actually goes live.  No doubt they'll try to get it to work
the way they said it would (two or more casters able to stack same
DoT on same target was supposedly gonna be the only change) and
break things horribly in the attempt, but you've probably got at
least until after the PoP shock settles to enjoy your newfound power.
