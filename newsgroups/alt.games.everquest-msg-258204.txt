Line dynamics present some great case studies, eh? Consider the following
case: my wife and I arrive at the movies and there are four ticket lines. We
take positions in two of them and then whoever reaches the front first buys
the tickets. Does that bother you? Would it make a difference if I brought
my kids and we occupied all four lines? Or how about this one: I'm in a
grocery store and there are two lines very near to each other and I stand
behind, kind of in the middle, making a non-verbal statement that I could be
in either one of these two lines. Basically, I'm trying to emulate the
situation at a bank or airport, where they wisely feed multiple tellers from
one line. Better efficiency all around until some guy decides to ask "Which
line are you in"? If he'd just STFU and follow my lead we'd all get to the
counter in the order that we arrived in line (which really is the most fair
result), but he could instead press the issue and make me take a stand. He
might even be conciously planning to take advantage of the potential
inequity of disparate lines (maybe he knows that one teller is faster than
the other) by forcing me to elect and possibly choose the slower.  How do
you feel about that situation?

Yeah I agree. You can fashion abstract policy that will work most of the
time, but the asshat factor will always intervene and cause things to go
sideways in certain situations. Best solution is to engineer out as many of
those opportunities as possible and the rest of the time you just have to
suck it up and deal with it.
