No, I play on the Seventh Hammer. It was on the Gnoll ledge in Highpass and
it happened twice. No duelling, no red players, lots of frenetic activity. I
selected the Necro's pet a few times when I was trying to taunt an aggro off
another group member. It would turn on me and whack me a few times, both
times following a taunt, and even though I had auto on I didn't swing back.
It also stopped attacking after a few seconds, without any commands to do
so.
