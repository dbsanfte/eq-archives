    Translocate is hell on wizards. At any pick-up zone zone-in, there'll be
some poor wizard trying to find a group and five gnats asking him for a
Translocate. They think nothing of it, too, because "it's so easy". Even on
raids, people will leave halfway through a raid because being TL'ed out is
so simple, and doesn't disrupt the raid. Well, except that now when you get
to the final mob you have half the people you started with and have to
abort. And you KNOW that if your guild does DKPs, that those people that
Trans'ed out early want raid credit....

    A few wizards on my server refuse to carry portal fragments when going
for XP, so that they pretty much cannot be bothered. I, of course, carry
portal fragments with me. ;-) You will not evade me, Gandaalf00!
