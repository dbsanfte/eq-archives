I don't know if

At around 6th level I was given a nice piercing weapon that I am still
using.  As soon as I was able to Backstab with it at level 10,  I would get
requests to see my weapon or people would ask me what I was using because I
was getting such high hits with it. It sure made this newbie feel special.
Will I ever pass it on NO WAY!!!  I love my Sturdy Grimling Mining Pick and
I will keep it forever.

That being said, I have passed on lots of other gear.  Even those little
cutthroat rings with +2DEX and +2AGI are a great bonus to a brand new
player.  (I remember how excited I was when someone gave me one) I spent a
couple of evenings up in Everfrost practicing my tailoring skills and giving
away the patchwork to the naked newbies there.  They were pretty excited.  I
can't buff or sow, so my ability to help out is limited, but I always pass
on the stuff that is worth a lot more to a newbie than the few gold or plat
I would get from a merchant.

But I have to tell you the most fun off all is on the rare occasion when I
can help out a high level player.  The other day I was asked to help a high
level shaman buy a spell in Qeynos (don't think it was for him tho).  They
spend so much time advising, buffing, rescuing, porting and equiping us
newbies that it was nice to have the opportunity to return a favor.

Ok time for me to stop rambling and get back to work-sigh
