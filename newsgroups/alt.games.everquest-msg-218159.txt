If the PLee has a real clue they have a hotkey set up that taunts, does
sense heading and disarm every time they kick.

It totally depends on the clue level of the person being powerleveled.
If it's someone's younger brother/friend with no experience playing
everquest they're likely to learn very little. Anyone who's played a bit
of everquest and paid any attention at all to what other people's roles
are in the groups they've been in should have little trouble handling
the basics of their character even if they were powerleveled into their
mid 50's. 

I've met people I know played thier characters untwinked to
high levels who still haven't quite got a handle on how to play. Some
people just don't get it no matter what, though they still enjoy the
game enough to keep playing. A good example of this is a paladin from my
previous guild, who had many of us spend many hours trying to get him
through the plane of justice trials. As much as we explained that he had
to get on each mob as quickly as possible, and use his group heals to
taunt if multiple mobs piled on the cleric he just couldn't switch mobs
fast enough to make it through, and managed to totally miss the cleric
getting beat on to the point of death without reacting. Some people just
can't seem to develop the awareness of what's happening around them that
good EQ players have, no matter how long they take to level their
characters. I've played with people who bought characters on E-Bay that
play better than some people I know who've played the same character
since 1999.
