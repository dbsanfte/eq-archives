As rumored, the recent patch has fixed the LDoN reward-claiming bug,
so people who bought LDoN retail can now claim their reward.  At least,
I got mine, and I did the mini-quest to upgrade it.  I found the quest
details Allakhazam, but I'm curious how the quest was discovered.  I
think I read something about using the keychain to solve a puzzle on
the web site, but I can't find the puzzle.  Has it been so long since
LDoN was released that they've removed the puzzle from the site?  Even
though a lot of LDoN buyers weren't able to work on the quest because
the reward was broken?

Oh well, I'm happy with my bag, at least.  (At last?)

	-- Don.
