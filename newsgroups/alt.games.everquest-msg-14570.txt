Don't worry too much about, as long as you're having fun.

I have been playing since April '99, have tried out about 10 different
chars, 6 are still "active", work a fair amount in my job, and just finished
off a graduate degree on top of my job, and finally, finally, have a char
that now has a last name (lvl 20) after playing tonite for a few hours
...just really hard fitting time into my schedule so its tough to "level up"
when Sunday morning seemed to be the only solid time I was able to play ...
the rest was rather sporadic.

While I was focussed on it I suppose, I also got tired of playing that
cleric when he hit 17 a few months back and started a barb warrior which I
deleted, a monk that I got to lvl 7 or so I think over the few weeks, and a
erudite pally up to 11 messing around in the Warrens .... my point being
this was my way of having fun in the game that's all.  Sounds like you are
having fun too so we'll both be happy if we meet in the game one day ...

(My best one is the wizard I started in August '99 - haven't played him in
about 6 months and I think he is lvl 14.  I remember playing with another
wiz when I started it up ... I still see him online today but he is now lvl
59.  Oh well .... :=)  )
