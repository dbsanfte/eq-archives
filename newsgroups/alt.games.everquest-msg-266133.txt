My dog once had a problem with an employee stealing wine out of a wine 
in the box he kept around for cooking purposes.  He took a hypodermic 
needle and injected a strong solution of alum in water into the bag 
(there's a plastic bag actually holding the wine inside the box), then 
waited for the retching to begin.  Alum is technically edible, used for 
some cooking purposes, but in quantity it out bitters unsweetened chocolate.

It only took once to stop the theft, although he never did figure out 
who the culprit was... someone had an incredible "game face

This strikes me as similar to your situation, and you could use a 
similar plan with your TV dinners, either alum or habanero sauce or thai 
chili oils should be easily injected into a plastic sealed TV dinner; 
I'd think you'd have to thaw the dinner out in order to allow the liquid 
to permeate, then refreeze.

Dye plans are probably better but I don't know anything about that 
angle, one thought would be something thats not visible under normal 
light, only under UV.

Another would be to use a food coloring instead of the alum/habanero 
plan; in high concentrations that stuff will dye your tongue pretty 
well, and its going to be a lot harder to wash away; all those 
industrial solvents and cleaners aren't reccomended for oral use, I imagine.

Happy days
