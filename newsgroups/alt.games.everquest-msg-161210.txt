Of course the problem is, he's exactly as deaf as an enchanter pet,
won't listen to a single command, up to and including pet report
health.

Cast each time, this is no problem, because he does attack my
designated target when he appears, and further his native HP are so
low that you never get into the classic chanter pet problems where
you can't get him to back off so you can move the mob to the correct
spot; if everyone else backs off the mob, the mob takes one morsel
sized bite and bang, no more cleric pet to worry about.

Persistant, though, suddenly the problem is how to get him to attack
at all!

Soloing, its not a problem of course, after all, he attacks anything
that attacks me, and thats easy to arrange.

In a hard core group, though, I find myself attacking from the front
with the highest haste I can get, trying to score a riposte!  Then
the MA swings the mob around, or backs up a bit, so as to get my pet
behind the mob to prevent Enrage killing the poor guy, while I also
position myself behind the mob because those ripostes hurt and they
along with dodges and parries do cut into my damage output.  I know
rogues everywhere are wincing at the thought of anyone back in "their
spot" but honestly if I'm up meleeing the odds of me getting anything
that resembles aggro are incredibly low (if I could get aggro this
riposte plan wouldn't be an issue)

Amazing how hard it is to get Riposted when you want to though.

Another plan I used was to heal the MA after he tagged incoming but
before the mob arrived, this got me beat on right away, but the MA
was able to get the mob off me fairly quickly as long as I remained
standing and didn't hit attack; I guess pet doesn't add much aggro at
all, because this was true whether I used Minor Healing or CE or
CHeal... well Minor Healing actually didn't work at all, probably not
enough to overcome the arrow hate.

I'm thinking another plan might be to root the mob and use prox aggro
to close in, get thwacked, and back out.  I can then drop a fire bolt
or three off my ragefire bracer in order to break the root if needed,
but regular root really doesn't last long anyway.

Another idea would be to go cleric puller, with the new lull
improvements this might really be my baliwick anyway, and its
something I've done quite a lot in "non-classical" groups.  I'd have
to watch out that my pet didn't grab aggro from me, though, and Brell
help me if I try to pull a summoning mob, cause we'd go from "no
damage" (MoR is my usual plan) to "oops" fairly rapidly with a hasted
hammer beating on the incoming.

Well, just thinking aloud
