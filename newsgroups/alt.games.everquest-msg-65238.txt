From my personal experiences so far.... I just simply found running from NRo
to NFP to be an interesting challenge last night.  I suppose I could
roleplay as an LSD junkie...(that would explain the constant
hallucinations!)  but otherwise I found the game just a couple of notches
above 'unplayable.'  And that's on Antonica...the oldest of the old world.

I'm not upset at Verant/Sony for this (it's only a game).....just that if
this condition persists, I will have to cancel my account (at least
temporarily) because, for the time being, I cannot play.  And neither can
half my RL friends/adventuring buddies.

My major activity in the game right now is to struggle to get all my
characters into safe zones in case of a long-term absence on my part.....
