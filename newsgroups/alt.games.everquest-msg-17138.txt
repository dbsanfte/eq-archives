Then I shall withdraw the suggestion that the rejections were due to a
stroppy GM (a stroppy Guide is another thing altogether...). But the human
veto system is plausible (won't say "true" until I see it with my own eyes),
and not all that "stupid" - how else are you going to do it?

And I'll give you 1cp if you replace "draw the conclusion" with "make an
assumption". 8)
