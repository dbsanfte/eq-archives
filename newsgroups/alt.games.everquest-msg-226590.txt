Lull does drop off, but their heals pick way up.  Fast casting 1100 hp
heals, and mana efficent heal over times. Group heals for AE damage.  A
paladin can easily  qualify as the "backup healer" if a group only has one.

Paladins have a lot of very nice spells avaialable to them, if used
properly.  They add a lot to raids as well, combining AE healing with off
tanking ability.  At our raids, paladins are the only class allowed (and
encouraged) to heal the puller on incoming. ; )
