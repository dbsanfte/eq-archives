It is wrong, but it's really not a big deal.

BTW, why does the FoH member's opinion have any more relevance than
anyone else's?  What would you have thought if a different FoH member
had been behind the most ardent condemnations of the woman and SOE? 
Would you suddenly have a problem with it?

Anyway, I'd just like to point out how many people delude themselves
over an issue like this.  To claim that you would or would not accept
the item if you were in that woman's shoes is silly.  You HAVEN'T been
given the item, so trumping up your virtue by saying you'd destroy it
if you had is an empty gesture.  It's a little different when the
million dollars is actually in your hand.

On the other hand, saying you'd keep it if you were in her shoes is
also a silly claim.  Who knows, maybe you'd be wracked with guilt over
not earning it.  You'll never know how you'll react until you're
actually in that position!
