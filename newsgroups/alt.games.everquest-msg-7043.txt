First of all, please turn off  the HTML next time.
Now, I don't think you're going to get any kind of nice shield for 10 P,
personally. But if you are a 19th level SK, there's a quick fix to your
problem. Run your ass out of FP, EC, WC, Kithicorre, and up into
Highpass. Go to the far end of the zone and start hunting the gnolls.
You should be able to get into a group, and if not, at your level you
can likely solo most of them easily enough. Keep killing them until the
named gnoll shows up.  As often as not he will drop the Cracked Darkwood
Shield, which is a pretty darned nice item considering the low level of
the mob it drops off of. I saw quite a few drop there when I was camping
them for faction, and he's a pretty easy kill.
