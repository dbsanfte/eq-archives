Um, I know we are having this discussion in another thread, but this is
hardly a rumor that is not true, as simple mathematics will show anyone with
an open mind.

If I fail 20% of the time with two weapons, then it is still the ratio that
matters.  The better ratio will yield better damage.

Just for grins, I ran both weapons through Copeland's weapon analyzer, the
results for off hand with a 10/15 vs. a 21/30 weapon.

10/15 yields 326 DPM
21/30 yields 336 DPM

I will admit the difference is not huge, but, the slower, better ratio
weapon yields better damage over time.

I will agree that if the damage to delay ratio is extremely close, then, the
faster weapon is better, I ran a 10/15 vs. a 31/45 and a 41/60, the results
are:

31/45 = 329DPM
41/60 = 325DPM

So, yes, at some point, the argument breaks down, and this has to do with
the way EQ calculates damage, but if there is any significant difference in
the ratio, then the better ration weapon is the one to use, unless, you are
specifically looking for increases in Dual Wield, or you are specifically
looking to gain aggro.  If the goal is to generate the most damage, then use
the best ratio weapon you have.
