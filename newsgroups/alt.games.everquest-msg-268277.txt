It's not just players, it's CSR's (Sony Online Entertainment customer 
support). The last example of CSR griefing is once in SWG we organized a 
group of about 30 players for a rally. Before we even began, we started 
getting system messages to disband. In seconds they teleported us to a 
remote location off on a distant planet, and froze us. We were suspended for 
disrupting normal gameplay. Some players are still frozen and it's been over 
a week. What's funny is there are 20 or 30 merchants in that same location 
who spam away from keyboard 24/7 and the CSR's never touch them. But we 
group up for a few minutes for a rally and we get suspended, some cases 
banned, and teleported away instantly.
