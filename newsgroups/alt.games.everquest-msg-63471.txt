I'll scream with you :) I just downloaded dx8.1 after one disconnect
20% through and one timeout at 10.5 mb downloaded (microshit actually
did something right and remembered those 10.5 mbs when I started over
again) and downloaded an experimental voodoo patch, since I suspect I
already have the download for the last official drivers since last
time I installed them (Yes, I save installation files, just in case)
I have no idea if official drivers, unofficial drivers, or neither
will let me play, and I won't find out till tomorrow night.

Tomorrow, I install. (It's 2.25 am here now)
