    Those two things really cause folks to avoid it like the plague. It's
terribly remote, so if you go there and nobody else is there you better be
able to solo in a dungeon environment. The nature of a CR there makes any
other dungeon of the same level pale in comparison. Most likely the person
who died jumped down the wrong shaft, and the group will have to
dungeon-crawl to the body. Since some of the mobs see through Hide/Sneak,
even the usual rogue retrieval doesn't work. (Note that the mobs ARE pretty
slow, and someone with SoW from outside, IF they resist the Darkness off the
spiders and IF they know where they're going, can usually run from a
drop-down point through the dungeon dragging the victim out.)

    There's a few nice drops. I forget some of the others, but the dagger
off the Strathbone Runelord and the random rare Strathbone Shell Shield are
just great items.
