The past 4-5 days haven't gone well for our furry-footed hero.

I dinged 26 in Lake of Ill Omen and decided a change of scenery was
necessary. Several people in-game told me Frontier Mountain wasn't
worth the risk so I decided to look elsewhere.  After extensive
reading at Caster's Realm and EQ Druids, I made my way to Everfrost to
hunt Woolly Mammoths. Great cash, great xp, right? Well the cash is
usually awesome, but the xp isn't. 

I tried Mistmoore tonight. I died twice in quick succession: once when
our party got overrun in the Graveyard and once when all three (!)
mobs our party was fighting decided to gang up on the poor druid
healer. I got my first rez ever after the first death, so I broke even
on the night.

A druid I know suggests hunting Gorlas (sp?) in Timerous Deep. Not
being able to bind in TD makes me nervous, and I prefer grouping to
soloing. A RL friend says Frontier Mountain is worth it despite the
risks. Or maybe I should go back to Everfrost. The xp isn't great but
the risk is small and, as mentioned, the loot is very nice.

{sighs} It's going to be a long road to 29.
