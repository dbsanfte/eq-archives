I kind of answered this previously. I consider the gun to be the present
evil. I consider people who insist that it is their right to carry a gun
or, specialy to stockpile weapons and teach small children to make bombs
etc to be a bit loopy, but hey, I'm not part of it, so I am going to
leave it to you all. Just don't be surprised when you're popping gun
number 2000 on top of your pile and the FBI kick in the door.
