IIRC some studdies there, and it seemed cha affected about 1% per 10 cha
in resist rates on mez and charm - on even or higher conning mobs & high
resist mobs with lower gains on lower level mobs, evening out to no
advantage on mobs much lower... I.E. lv is god, cha is nice when pushing
the limits.

I agree on HP.  Int I don't really care that much about myself being an
erudite, I can get to 200 without hardly trying, only run out of mana
when soloing, and usually run out of hp about 10x as often.

My list for twinkage is very simple for 1k.

buy 2 velium fire opal rings (6ac, 65 hp)
a cheap 2h stick to beat things with, use until 20th.
go to the nexus and get a kei.

That's all the twining an enchanter needs.
