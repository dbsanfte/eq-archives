I have done it 3 times at 52 solo; but it wasn't pretty. Go in fully
buffed (resists too) and have gate up; you'll need it to escape.
Basically, my technique was to go in camo'ed being careful to avoid any
mobs that see invis, nuke Maid Isis till dead (there will be 2 or 3 other
mobs beating on ya while you do it), loot her, and gate out. You will be
beaten up pretty good; but it is survivable. Have calefaction up as your
secondary nuke; the fast cast time makes the difference between getting
the killing shot off while being hit and dying yourself.
