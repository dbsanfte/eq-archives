I've played EQ since release, and am only now experiecing
what may be the onset of terminal burnout :)  I'm not a pvp'er,
or pvp proponent in general.  Finally, I'm not in the DAoC beta,
all information I have is what's leaked out from under the NDA
on the forums.

That being said, I'm going to give DAoC a shot early on, I've
seen the steps Mythic is taking to try to ensure a smooth launch.
While I don't believe it will go off without a hitch, I do believe
it will be far better than the AO launch.

On PvP - consider this:  You don't have to recover your corpse
in DAoC, you don't get xp loss from PvP combat (relieving you
of the necessity of returning to your headstone to mitigate xp
loss), and you can't have you items/gold looted from pvp.  Taken
altogether this means that dying in PvP combat earns you a
free gate to your bind spot, and earns your opponent realm points.
Together with the fact that your bindstone will be in a town
in the interior of your realm (where the the really tough guards are),
you should be safe from the vast majority of grief play (corpse and
bind point camping, exp loss deaths).  PvP on those terms is
pretty painless, and definitely something I'll consider.

As far as the Uber guilds, well, you're probably right.  WIth their
inside knowledge from beta, and the kind of organization and
powergaming they bring to bear they will level the fastest, and
engage in RvR combat the soonest.  If a comparable guild
doesn't set up in your realm on your server, it's likely your relics
will be gone within a month of release (along with the stat
bonuses they confer).  That being said, how does that differ from
their ability to get the best gear and hold down the the toughest
spots in EQ?  In any MMORPG, these guilds are going to come
out ahead of those who are on their own or in small guilds, it's
the nature of the beast.  The bright spot in this is the fact that
the frontiers are huge, there will be no way for one uber guild
to defend a whole frontier, much less defend the relics and
continue to raid other realms.  I'm hoping there will be plenty
of chance to adventure in the frontiers without having to be
part of one Uber guild.

DISCLAIMER:  This is not an EQ sucks, DAoC rocks post.
I LIKE EQ.  I just think DAoC shows promise, and am very
interested in giving it a try.
