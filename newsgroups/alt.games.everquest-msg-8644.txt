Using this as the guideline for faction hits is completely useless.

All faction hits are not the same.
I repeat, all faction hits are not the same.

I kill Lendiniara.  *ONE* kill takes me from amiable to warmly to the
Kromzeks.  That same kill can trivially take me from indifferent to
threatening to the CoV.

But the faction "message" will look the same as if I had slapped some
non-named critter in Skyshrine.

The tougher the mob is the bigger the faction hits, both positive and
negative.

To raise CoV faction, you MUST hunt the Kromzek based giants in Kael.
While you will see CoV faction hits with Kromrif giants (the frost
giants outside in EW/GD/WL), they will be so slight that you would go
insane before you got to any half decent faction.

Kill the higher leveled named Kromzeks in Kael if you want CoV
faction.
