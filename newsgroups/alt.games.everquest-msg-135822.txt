Now THAT was funny too!!!  :^)

I have noticed that about Lesa's debating skills..

She pulls in all sorts of different ideas from all over the place,
plops them down on the table and says, "THERE!  See!!??"

And then she gets pissed when someone interprets what she said to be
something she did not mean.

But, that seems to be her way..  A person states things as ambigiously
as possible, leaving it open to several different possibilities.  That
way said person can change their argument to be whatever happens to be
popular at the time.

Personally, I think that is a chicken-shit way to debate. State your
position clearly and concisely and stand by it, unless faced with
overwhelming evidence that your position is wrong.
