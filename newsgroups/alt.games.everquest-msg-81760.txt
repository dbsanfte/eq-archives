A friend and I were going down the road the other day.  As a little red
Honda flew by us followed by two police cars, my friend looks at me and says
"train to zone".

Same friend and I, a couple of days later, were in his truck and saw someone
pulled over on the side of the highway.  A second policecar shows up and
pulls in behind them, and without thinking I said "add".
