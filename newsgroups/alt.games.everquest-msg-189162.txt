Everyone else has already given you the reasons to keep good faction.  Keep in
mind that most of the Coldains in EW, (missionaries) are an undercon.  They
were very hard for my ranger and my wizard friend at around 48.  They complete
heal and port themselves back to where they started. (We needed to kill them
for a quest.  Luckily we'd killed at the rygorr fort forever and are still
"ally" in Thurg).
