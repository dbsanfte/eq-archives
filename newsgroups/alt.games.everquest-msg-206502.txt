I got a few posts about the "Unfortunately" part of this one, so I address 
them here.  I say it only in reference to the fact that he can't do what he 
wants to do in particular, not that I have any great desire to have people 
making entirely automated bots.  Though I do have to say that I have wanted 
something like what the OP is describing where you can randomly select an 
incoming message.
