Its an acknowledged problem that a number of us, superbly led by SloScout
have posted probable solutions to on the official Tech Forum. The thread has
been picked up by Verant and they have a partial fix currently on the Test
Server.

I won't go into too much detail, but those who have been hacked off over the
months or even years now by Verant telling us that all the problems are
caused by our not having the latest drivers might be amused to know that EQ
runs on the Miles Sound System, for which Verant are currently using
out-of-date system drivers. They are also forcing your machine to run sound
through software mode rather than hardware mode. The music currently on Test
(with up-to-date drivers) is much richer and deeper (like it used to be a
zillion patches ago) but the stuttering/skipping hasn't been fixed for all
configurations yet.

At last there is some light at the end of the tunnel, if I may mix a visual
metaphor with a sound problem :).
