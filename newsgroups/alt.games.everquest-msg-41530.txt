Don't be absurd.  That's just silly.

I suspect that VI is no longer giving server numbers because
they don't others to see folks dropping out of EQ (which will
not be me) to play the new game on the block.  They are no
longer giving the numbers because it's extremely easy from
a CS standpoint from this point on to blame a customer's ISP
for EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM YOU HAVE IN THE
GAME!  Nothing is ever their fault anymore.

Also, if the other new games (which I won't play...I love EQ)
take enough folks away, what would stop them from combining
a couple of previously stand-alone server?  Why keep two
2200-peak servers up, when from a money standpoint, you
can keep one 4400-peak server up.  What will the folks on
the "new" server say? "Hey, where'd this other 114 member
Uber guild come from? Did you combine servers?" "No,
the server has the exact same number of folks...you just must
have never met them before...talk to your ISP about the
quadrupled lag."

That's just it...saying they don't want the competition to get
those numbers when they've been a marketing tool for the last
2 years is just dumb, and insults me.  Now, if they said," We
don't want NeverWinter Nights (yeah, I know...:-)  ) to know
that since they came out, our subscription numbers have dropped
by 100,000 subscribers," then I'd believe 'em.  It'd still be crappy,
but it would be honest and believable.
