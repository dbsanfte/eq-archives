I actually thought the euro servers and now Stromm were exceptions, 
though I couldn't figure out why, simply because I assumed the newest 
server (thereby least established) would have the fewest players. Then I 
created a character on it and saw the utter hysteria and mayhem wrought 
by the mass of fresh characters generating record numbers of corpses in 
every newbie zone. Then the server's population ranking made much more 
sense, until I considered what this population would look like spread 
over all zones in Norrath.

I'm back to the exception theory.  :-/
