Hmm, I snipped this infomation from another thread and stuffed it in my
Drafts folder, no idea how I ended up posting it as well.

I don't know what the +4..-4 numbers indicate, if anything.

The faction point totals, on the other hand, are apparantly derived from
use of some quasi legal software that read actual information the game
uses, so that those are the "real" numbers used, or were back when they
made the chart, which was, I think, a couple years and -numerous- patches
ago.

If you can find a mob to kill which gives you one faction point, and you
are at "max KOS" which would be -2800, and you kill 5600 of them, and
there isn't a cap to your faction, then this should put you at "max ally."

BUT, your real lowest point and highest point are apparantly also bound by
your race and class, so that you might be unable to drop lower than
threateningly, or raise higher than indifferent, or so on and so forth.
Still, within those lines, you should be able to guage your progress on
this scale.

Sadly, its not -really- useful without knowing how much faction any given
kill or quest actually gives you, since most seem to give more than one
point.

For example, I recently took my shaman True Spirit faction to Max Ally.
Started at dubious; was I at -500?  -101?  Somewhere in between?  No
idea.  Did several subquests without taking notes, and got my faction up
to Kindly.  But +500?  +699?  Somewhere in between?  No clue.  Did another
part, now I was at Warmly.  Was that part good for 599 points (taking me
from 500 to 1099) or 1 point (from 699 to 700) or somewhere in
between...say for example 200 points from 500 to 700... no information,
but thats quite a range.

Then I repeated a portion twice, and got to ally.  This means that part
could be no larger than 399 points (any more, and even at the bottom of
Warmly I'd be in Ally country.  Did that part twice more and another part
twice and one of the earlier parts 3 times... 1700 points, but all I can
say is that none of those parts was larger than 845 points (assuming the
other parts were worth only 1 each).

Hmm, what else.  Just today I handed in 200 bone chips in Kaladim.
Started at Dubious, ended at Warmly.  Thats a maximum spread of 1599
points, or 8 points per chip (handed in in chunks of 4, for 32 points per
handin) and a minimum spread of 801 points, or 4 points per chip, for 16
points per hand in.  So if you are Dubious and want to become Indifferent,
you know it will take at worst 500/4=125=>128 chips, and at best
-101/8=13=>16 chips.  the difference between 128 and 16 is a pretty large
one, but at least you have -some- clue whats needed.
