Clerics who don't worship Innorruk miss out on a clicky snare item.  Since they do get Fear, the lack of
ability to snare is astonishingly painful.

I can't think of any overwhelming benefit for taking any other deity as a cleric, Innorruuk blows them all
away with this one simple item.

This item was not in the game when I made my current cleric, and when it WAS introduced I almost scrapped
him and started over.  But thats the level 3 symbol for innorruuk, while Brell had only the first two.  So
I figured I'd stick with Brell and hope for something good for the third symbol.  Still waiting.... and
honestly there isn't a day that I dont' consider making an Innoruuk cleric after all.  Heck, its only 65
levels to do over, and I'd have clicky snare!
