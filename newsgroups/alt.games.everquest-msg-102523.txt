 Problem with that is not all of the Druids at the rings are on
JaggedPine faction. I was thinking they were maybe on Ranger faction
although the KithicorResidents may be a possibility as well. The best
way to find out is to just kill one of them I guess and see which
factions go down. Any evil here ever kill the mobs at the WC ring? If so
which factions went down.

 With the JPT faction you can safely port to NK and EK. WC you'll still
be kos to the two named, but they are on the other side of the port-in
spot so you should be ok. Surefell you should be ok to port in but
running out you'll probably get some aggro since they all aren't on JPT
faction.
