Nah, still works for me at 59 on blues...depending on where it is, of
course.  But I toss a Slow in there while mezzed.

But Chris Martin, sorry, but enchanters are crappy nukers compared to the
real nuking classes, because of the recast delay.  Yup, you can mem up 2
nukes and chain, but that rarely seems to be a decent option.  Now, if you
want to have fun, put a wizard on your second computer/account...that's an
easy dual-machine combo and you learn what real nuking is. <g>

Saying enchanter can nuke quite nicely is saying that shaman can melee quite
nicely (past 20)...folks like to kid themselves but neither is all that
true.:)
