I love the lower levels.  I start chars all the time on different servers
and play them up a few levels to see how I like them.  If I do, I create the
same on my main server.  All of my slots are filled right now.  I recently
killed my barb shaman to start a beastlord.

The new low level quests help out a lot but even before then, and before the
super fast levelling up to 10, I enjoyed playing in new newbie zones,
getting my first plat, etc.  My highest char is 30 and I have 4 others in
the high teens.  My half-elf ranger will probably have a last name by next
weekend (I only play a few hours during the week).  Up to 10, I kind of
benchmark my characters by comparing what they have when I ding 10.  My best
so far is a full suit of leather and 35pp.

I think the game misses a lot by the new power levelling up to 10 and
keeping all of your stuff when you die.  My druid got curious and explored
blackburrow when he was level 5 way back when.  I fell down a hole in a tree
and just about crapped myself running around re-invising myself, until my
wife said, What about the port thingy you got at 5?  Duh, gated out
sweating!  Now it's so what, I got my stuff and no xp loss.  I know why they
did it, to reduce the early frustrations, and for mass marketing it was a
good move.  I died, and had to do a corpse run, many times early on because
I didn't know what the clipping plane slider was for and it was maxed down.
My first few months consisted pretty much of, Boy it's foggy.  What's that?
Loading please wait.  Naked corpse run, usually in WK, when I had never
heard of loc, in the fog, up hill.  Man that was fun.  Sometimes frustrating
as hell, but I remember it fondly now.

I still have that kind of fun when I play low level chars.  At 30 (and I
can't imagine even higher) losing xp is soooo painful because it takes so
long to get.  Just recovering mana or HP takes forever.  Oh well, I'll keep
playing my characters until they get wherever they get and I'll keep playing
low level characters for the newness of it.
