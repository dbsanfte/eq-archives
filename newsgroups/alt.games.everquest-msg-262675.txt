It could only happen if a very large number of Republicans and/or 
Democrats also voted for him.  Certainly not an absolute impossibility, 
but, unlikely as all hell.

I don't care for our current system, but, it leaves little choice, there 
are two viable candidates.  The single most important thing to me in this 
upcoming election is that Bush not be elected.  I am voting my 
conscience.  It is the only choice I have under our current system.

Given our current system, I feel the best outcome of any election is to 
keep the presidency and the houses of opposite parties, regardless of 
which of the two parties holds sway in which position.
