Autosplit is crap, dont use that as an excuse.  If you loot 5pp off of a
corpse in a full group, you get it all, and everyone else gets nothing.  In
the groups that I'm in, autosplit is always off.  Why is it unfair for a
caster to ask for a share of the loot?  "You can make money otherwise" is a
bullshit excuse, they helped kill the monsters, they are entitled to loot.
That is like telling clerics that they dont deserve loot because they can
make money Ressing, wizards because they can port, necromancers because they
can solo and get all the money they need, etc etc.  The problem lies not
with the druid, but with you.
