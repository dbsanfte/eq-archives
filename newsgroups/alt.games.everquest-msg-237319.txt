In the vast majority of xp situations, that's not true.  A mage in
an xp group very seldom needs a deeper mana pool - he simply lacks
the tools to dump his mana quickly.  Long cast time spells and no
way to dump aggro will not let him go oom from 70mana in most
emergencies. (too clarify - won't let ME, somewhere over 4k mana,
4k ish HP (group buffed) go oom)

Do BL's need HP and AC?  They sure do if you want that flexibility.
If they can't take a hit, then a huge part of their advantage over
some of the other classes goes away.  Namely, I can slow even 1200
hitter sewer mobs immediately and survive the aggro, I can tank for
HoH XP groups easily.  In order to be a decent DPS class I need to
have decent weapons, as that's ~40% of my sustained DPS.

The big advantage that mages have is an extraordinary degree of 
gear independence.  The big disadvantage that mages have is the
failure of gear to improve them as much as it does melee/hybrids.

Ryan agrees and has mentioned introducing a wider range of pet
foci to allow pets to scale with their owners more.  If some of
these are droppable, my entire thesis becomes false.

As for cost of spells:  Mages have 12 spectrals (of
which 2 are useless, 2 are simply eh, nice to have and 1 has only
2 situational uses) vs. 5 spectrals for BL's.  This is offset
by the fact that they sell for about half as much as BL spectrals.
Mages have 3 rune spells - of which 1 has only 2 situational uses,
1 is entirely useless and 1 is a must have.)  The prices I've seen
on the first go as low as 20k, the 2nd who cares and the 3rd as
low as 30k.  BL's have 2 rune spells - 1 is nice and the only time
I've seen it for sale was at 50k, the other is a must have and I
RAN to get it for 40k (it usually sells for 50k on Lanys).

As for gear - A better mainhand weapon alone will run me over
120k (Golden Fists (wraps?) of the Compact).  The tunic I 
really really want runs 300k (Stonehide /drool).

That cash, and 1 more LDoN in Tak would get my mage to FT15, with
cash left over.  At that point I might start worrying about more HP 
- but seriously: on 1200 hitter mobs do you really think 5khp over 
4khp is going to allow me to live if I draw aggro?

I have a great deal of respect for your experience and knowledge
martin, but I stand by my assertion:  To get the range of abilities
that mages on the tower bitch about in BL's, you have to spend
more money on them (or raid more).
