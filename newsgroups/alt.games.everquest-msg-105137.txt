If what you're saying is true -- then why do casters get new spells at all?
Why don't they just keep using the level 1 spell their whole career?  As
long as they can cast it 200 more times, they are 200 times more effective.

The answer is that their new spells are more _mana efficient_, which is what
makes them better.  In, gasp, the exact same way that better ratio weapons
make a melee class more effective.  The difference is you can't equip your
Wizzietwink with Ice Comet or Sunstrike.

What?.  Even with the damage caps, you're saying a warrior with a centi
longsword and a lammy is "marginally" better than a non-twinked warrior?
And that's just talking offense ...

That has nothing to do with the discussion.  Twinking improves melee classes
an order of magnitude more than it improves casters.  Where they begin is
meaningless.

I'm not debating if twinking makes a caster better, or if it makes them
safer.  Or certainly not whether or not it is useful.  What I'm saying is it
doesn't make you any more efficient, and that it doesn't help you in the way
twinking helps a melee class.
