I assume you mean what side is what, what reasons behind their leaving ect.

I haven't looked into SoL at all even though I do own it (actually own every
single expansion but hardly leave the main three areas, probably because my
main is 33) but the Vah-Shir were forced from Norrath by mainly Qeynos I
believe. They had to port to da moon. Thats as far as my knowledge goes with
SoL. Just check out hail NPCs in the main cities, go into chat and ask a GM
(when they arent busy, not many people normally early in the day or real
late at night you can find Gen Chat with few people and they normally feel
fine talking about various things)
