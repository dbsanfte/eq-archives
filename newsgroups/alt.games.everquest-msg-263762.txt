Frankly, right now it's not clear which direction it's going to take. As we 
speak I am the only Alchemist on the Beta2 server, there are two Jewelers, 2 
Sages and one Armorsmith. Not one Weaponsmith, Tailor, Carpenter, 
Woodworker, or Provisioner. To be fair, it takes a significant commitment to 
hit level 20 as an artisan and with the complexity of the system being what 
it is, not many survive the brutal ramp up through the teens. Tonight's 
patch was supposed to speed up the process a little (wrong approach if you 
ask me, it's already plenty fast) so perhaps things will change after this 
next patch. I'm sure there are plenty of up and coming senior crafters in 
the pipeline.
