Hmmm 60/61? Which is it?

So we are not really seeing that little blue bar move faster? Come on
we've all grouped we know what that xp is like, and anyone saying
grouping beats multi-kiting (in the right areas) has lost something
along the line. If any place is giving an full group a solid blue at
55 every 8-15 minutes in complete safety, I gotta see it. If there is
a zone where I can log in and start right away, no long lfg, no longer
lf healer/tank/chanter this I want to know about. Kill rate gentlemen
thats what its all about when looking at xp. A bard can kill a mob
every minute and a half or less swarming, a druid one every two
minutes( including med time) . A full group has to kill 24-30 mobs
every 10 minutes just to keep up with a quader, lets not even mention
swarmers. True xp bonus and other considerations may slow the soloer
but they slow the group even more. Hmmmm....

Tell ya what I take it back multi-kiting bites, dont do it. Go find a
group in velks (shudder) and sit there till 60. Thats the way to do
it, all these guys pulling 4-20 mobs are fools. In fact dont go near
the zones where its even possible to multi-kite cause they will train
you. 

I will offer to keep a close eye on these zones for you though, some
sacrifices must be made after all :)
