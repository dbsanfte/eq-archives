From the shadows, the mysterious jaZZmanian Devil <jshaw@stny.rr.com>
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>*after* they get in? :-)

The same thing that happened when VP and later ST were cleared. They
settle down to farm all the mobs for the drops for the guild. (okay if
the VP mobs dropped anything worth farming, that's would have happened
at least)

You don't need to be a master of prognistication to know that. :-p
