Explain how.  Whats stopping them right now from adding a dungeon to
the three home realms with a dragon in it? Said dragon having a
Flaming Sword of Uberness as it's main loot and said dragon taking a
combined team of two to three groups of high levels to kill. Why
couldn't they?
Say they did. Say John the Blademaster got the Sword of uberness. Say
it boosts Sword skill 10 points and has a built in stackable damage
shield. Say it procs a mini heal on its owner every 5 swings. So what?
The sword like all loot in Daoc will wear out. In the meantime yes the
owner will have a higher chance of killing others, but so what, they
won't know who he was or why? And since death costs them Nothing they
won't bother to wonder, especially if rumors of uber weapons appearing
in their own realm appear.
