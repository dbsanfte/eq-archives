Once upon a time, in America, back in the olden times when there were 
only three television networks, so we had very little selection, there 
were shows which were very popular.

One of those shows, in the 1970s, was Happy Days, based on a fantasy 
version of the 1950s, sort of a cleaned up American Graphiti.

That show ran for several years, I think everyone basically agrees that 
it ran long past the point where it was worth watching, coasting on its 
former success and bolstered by the lack of anything else worth watching 
(the three network phenomenum again)

Many people have discussed the transition from a good show to a bad 
show, and largely reached the consensus that it came at one specific 
episode, one where Fonzie (the "cool" greaser antihero of the show) did 
a stunt where he jumped over a shark.

This has become the metaphor for any show, and later any institution, 
which was once good but has slumped into an inane or lame shadow of its 
former self.

To say that America "jumped the shark" with the 2004 election is to say 
that this is the point where the country stops being a bonafide 
superpower and force for right and good.

I think thats silly for two reasons; one, you can only really identify a 
point like that from the perspective of history, there's no way to tell 
a momentary glitch from the start of a downward trend when you are in 
the moment.  Second, I'd say -if- the decline has begun, then it started 
at the end of the 2000 election, when Al Gore decided to contest the 
results, something nobody had ever done before (AFAIK)

OR it came when we actually impeached Bill Clinton based on sex and lies 
about sex.

Arguing which was the actual "jump the shark" moment would give 
democrats and republicans something to amuse themselves with while the 
rest of the world goes to hell in a handbasket.
