Well, one day after launch, I managed to get in, and was impressed
enough to jot down some thoughts:

Con system:  For all the bitching and moaning about this (and I'll
admit, I was kinda dubious as well), I eneded up really liking this.
They've added a fair amount of information to a small space, and I
don't find it intrusive or overwhelming at all.  Much like CoH, it
gives you a fair idea of how well you';ll do against a given mob.  It
allows a player to compensate for information that they'd have in the
real world that doesn't translate into a video game.  (Most of us can
size someone up as looking 'tough' IRL, but how do you get that across
with limited memory and textures?)  Overall, thumbs up.

Oh, and as for the linking of mobs?  I don't think this dumb's the
game down too much.  Again, it provides info that it may be difficult
to show in a video game.  Same for the 'Group/Solo' tag.  I find it
makes little difference compared to the con color of the mob.

Video:  Screenshots and video do not do the game justice.  It is
pretty, and smooth.  Playing in game with the dynamic lights, lens
flares, etc going, I found little to no problems through most of the
zone.  Quick specs: AMD A64 3k+, 1GB ram, Ati 9600 256MB vid.

So pretty decent, but not top of the line.  I upped the texture
quality to High (cuz of the 256MB vid), and turned on a lot of the
toys (flora, lens flare, heat distortion, etc) and kept shadows to
minimum, and had no stuttering or problems.  At 1024x768, the game
still looked good enough that I had no complaints.  No real feelings
of "plastic looking" models.  Not quite the quality of DoomIII, but it
scaled pretty well for low resolutions.

Sound:   Wow.  A real good job here.  I haven't found the voice audio
annoying yet, and after playing with it, I find it hard to play
without it.  The music isn't bad, though I shut it off right quick.
The combat music blends nicely with a fight, giving an increased sense
of excitement.  Much like a well-scored film.

Lag:  I can't comment too much.  In the newbie zone itself, with the
aforementioned toys turned on, I had one LD over 4 hours, and I was
able to get back in fast.   There was no apprecialble lag at all, even
with 80 people in the zone, something that would have caused me to
stutter huge in PoK, and kinda does in Atlas Park in CoH on the same
machine.  We'll see how the Commonlands hammer things tomorrow.

Immersiveness:  A big win here.  I thought it was a little plain
looking util I got into the video options and started playing.  Upping
the flora, and particles suddenly filled the world up.  I had to hunt
through the undergrowth for the snakes and beetles, and even lost
sight of a pup or two.   The animals look pretty realistic.  The
shimmer off the water and the detailed sky really helped get you
soaked as well.

The game elements were mildly distracting, but dragging most of the
bars outside the letterbox helped keep the field of vision clear.  The
mob names break the illusion somewhat, as do the targeting circles,
but that is a concession to gameplay, and can be turned off.  (Think I
might have to once I get the comfortable with the game).

Overall, I'm pretty impressed with the game.  I bought it because a) I
wanted to check it out and b) WoW and HL2 weren;t out yet, even though
I was sceptical with the rush to release.  Whether I stay past the
first month remains to be seen, but that depends on how well the game
is past 20.
