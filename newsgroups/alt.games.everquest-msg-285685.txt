You know, I knew when I was writing this that something was desperately 
wrong with my count, but I couldn't put my finger on it.  I juggled 
things around and still was coming up really short on raw numbers of 
clerics and so on.

So thats 36 man raid format, and we've got three more 6 man groups to go 
with.  Given that the individual group constructions are still sound, 
what are we looking at, a second Healer group and two more DPS groups? 
Or perhaps there's a "special team" I'm overlooking, that should also be 
included?
