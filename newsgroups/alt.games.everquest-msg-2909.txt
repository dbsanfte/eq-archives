this is good, and what I did (unpopular with some, but gets the point
across) with my cleric and my warrior is tell them when we group: 
"Do not run if you get aggroed. I will not chase you. If you run away,
I will assume you have decided to handle the problem yourself, and
apply my spells or sword elsewhere."  

Otherwise known as rooting the caster ;)
