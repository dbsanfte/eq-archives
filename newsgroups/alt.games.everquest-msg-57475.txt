My barrels of junk mail come from people scouring geocities and
finding my geocities/yahoo address. The shavenwookie address has
gotten spam less than half a dozen times in the time I have had it,
and the unmunged address I used for posting while at university got
much less spam than my yahoo address.

My favorites are the ones offering bulk mail services...
