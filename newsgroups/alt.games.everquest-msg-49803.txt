Hiyas,

Just had a great day in EQ yesterday! Went on my first ever Fear Raid (what
a blast!!!) AND I dinged level 50 while on the raid!!! On the raid there was
about 35 ppl, in my group we had myself (shaman), a bard, a monk, a ranger
and a rogue, (yes only 5 of us in our group) and we would have got 75% of
all the kills - damn amazing if you ask me.

I f33l UB3R!!! :)
