Just an idea, but go into display
properties=>settings=>advanced=>troubleshooting and click the hardware
accelleration back one notch.  It will give you a message that this is for
mild video problems, such as mouse pointer problems or some such BS.  This
has helped me in a couple other games over the years when the mouse hoses.

Best I can guess, good luck.
