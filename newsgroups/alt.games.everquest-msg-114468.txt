Grats!  I just noticed today your sig had changed to reflect the level-up.
Sure took alot of pressure off of me and my personal play-style wich is
borderline compulsive-obsessive/powergamer - when my main hit 60  ;-)

I admit I have loads of fun when I'm bored by stripping naked, heading to
wfp, nuking myself down to a thin line of health, going anon (no surname)
and doing what appears to be a death march towards the guards.  First heal
and/or assist I get earns the caster the full monte of level 60 dru buffs
and usually any vendor fodder I might be carrying atm.

enjoy your further adventures :-)
