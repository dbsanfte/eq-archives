As opposed to the guys who get Death Touched every minute or so? Dying 
'just 'cuz' has been a staple of raid mobs for a long time.

Do you want every mob to be the same? Does it offend you on some level 
that there are some encounters where you are less useful than others... 
and others where you are the cats meow.

I think there is a lot of room for encounters that are designed primarly 
for a caster raid, and encounters that are designed for a melee raid, 
encounters where there is no main tank, where a healing chain doesn't 
work, etc etc etc ... 

> Why play a game like that?

Every class has always had bits of the encounter where they are dead 
weight. For a long time nukers just hung out in the back not doing 
anything waiting for the call to nuke at 30% or 10% or whatever. Good 
times those where.

'I have yet to see...' is a long way from 'I cannot imagine...'

That SOE hasn't done it doesn't mean it can't be done.

So now we're arguing for static encounter scripts because we need to be 
tolerant of lag?? I can think of better ways of dealing with lag than 
restricting the programmers to writing -predictable- encounters.

Not quite, you want challenges that effectively go away when you know 
about them. Or is telling the magician to move to the left when gets 
near 60% in advance of the raid your idea of a challenge. 8)

Yeah, putting up with something hard for something that is only 
'arguably' better vs farming easy crap for something that is 'arguably' 
just as good, still sounds like inadequate itemization to motivate one 
to try the hard event, unless those players are actually interested in 
the challenge for its own sake.

(And yes those players do exist, in comparatively small numbers, but 
they're out there... playing Diablo2 hard core, and what not else...)

Following a straight line (which is all a static linear script is) 
doesn't require much to deconstruct, beyond 'looking at it'. Getting all 
your raiders to react properly at the right time once you have 'looked 
at it' -is- a challenge, a challenge of execution, as you stated.

About on par with synchronized swimming. 

(No offense to synchronized swimmers!! Its merely the observation that 
you want to defeat encounters by getting a bunch of people to executute 
an essentially choreographed plan in synchronicity... its challenging to 
be sure... as any synchronized swimmer will assure you.)

See synchronized swimming ;-)

I want challenges with predictable parameters, but unpredictable details 
like team sports (hockey, soccer, paintball).

You want synchronized swimming.

I am in the wrong game. =)
