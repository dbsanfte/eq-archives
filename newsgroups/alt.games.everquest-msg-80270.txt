I've never actually played AD&D (I sort of went directly from old-ruleset 
D&D to computer games), but I don't necessarily have a problem with 
people refering to EQ creatures with the names of their equivalent in 
AD&D, although they must be aware of the risk of leaving some people 
behind. Me, I had no idea what the hell a "Drow" was until I figured it 
out from context by the fifth or sixth time I heard the term. As far as 
I'm concerned, "Drow" sits there with "chanter", "dorf" and "dr00d" as 
forms of lazy, unimaginative shorthand, which I would not use, but won't 
bring myself to give someone grief over, either. 

On the other hand, regarding "Pfil Mashorts", there is no "right" or 
"wrong" there; what there is is a very specific rule, put there by Verant 
themselves, that is beign broken. I've becomed too jaded to care, to be 
honest (although there *is* a difference on how I treat people depending 
on the name they give themselves), but the rule is there and it isn't 
terribly ambiguous or hard to understand. 

The same argument of "it's only a game, hon, so relax", can be applied 
after someone trains a horde of mobs on you and kills you , or cheats you 
out of 3kpp in a trade scam (both of which I imagine would make you 
justifiably angry), so please don't take for granted that 
whatever doesn't bother you mustn't bother anybody else either, be it 
character names, in-game actions, or resorting to lazy shorthand.
