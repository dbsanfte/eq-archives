First I ever heard of a 2M number for EQ, the peak I head of was over 
500k.

I would be shocked if there was a 10k hard cap anyway, given that EQ 
accounts are not server based.  Most people actively play on only one 
server at any time, but many do have characters created on more than one 
server.  Heck, I have characters on 5 or 6 servers.

Regardless, the mmorpgchart site seemed to track very well with the 
figures in the article on the IEEE site (numbers from SoE as I understand 
it) up to the peak point of 550kish active accounts.  Having no 
information to the contrary at this point, I'd guess that they continue 
to track the actual figures reasonably well now.
