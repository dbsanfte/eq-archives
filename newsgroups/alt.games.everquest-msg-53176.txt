Agree that rogue is not a solo class eveen I did that till around level 25.

Bear in mind that our greatest gift in the EQ world is back stabbing. You
cannot just try to start the battle with a single BS (and it may miss too)
and then face the mob and do melee. That is not our job.

Our job is to do great damage in a group fight, using suitable poison to
assit the group by debuff or snare or any other poison effect.

A solo rogue can make good fortune by stealing, or do whateven a rogue will
do in RL. But it will be hadrer and harder to level.
