The great minds at SoE have done it again!  They have made some really
screwed up Expansion such as Luclin, and LoY. But this one really takes the
cake folks. As stated in the AD info you get free gifts which buying this
expansion which are, No AAs, dropped back to lvl 50, and can no longer enter
expansion zones.  Now, with all these great reasons who would not want to
buy it and just quit giving these leechs money?  ME ME ME!! And many others.

Come on folks let all jump on the bandwagon together and move to SWG.
