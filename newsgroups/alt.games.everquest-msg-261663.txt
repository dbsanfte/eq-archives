Actually... if you look at the tables I posted, its clear that most 
characters will be able to reach ally or scowls from almost any starting 
position within the 2000 hits limit.

The -only- exception is if you start out deep scowls or deep ally (which 
i don't think anyone starts at); then you can't reach the other end of 
the spectrum.

The vast majority of factions start out at shallow scowls thru to 
amiable so the 2000 limit isn't really that limiting in most cases.
