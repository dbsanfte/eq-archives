That is exactly my point.  If you have a name that is historic/current
event (i.e., NOT class 1 or class 2), should you be banned simply for
trying to create it repeatedly?

That "repeated creation" clause did not previously appear in the TOS.

Here are the name violations.

   1. Vile, profane, rude, or racist names including common swear words,
      anatomical references, racial slurs, and homonyms of these words.
   2. Combinations of words that produce an offensive result (e.g.
      Hugeaz, Tug Mcgroin). 
   3. Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin (e.g.
      Jesus, Allah, Satan, Stalin).

Here are policies

   - For category 1 or 2 offenses, a GM may delete the character as soon
     as it is discovered!^>Su will not be notified of this deletion. The
     items and experience levels on the character will not be restored or
     reimbursed under any circumstances. Depending on the nature of the
     offensive name, the account may also be subject to disciplinary
     action including suspension or banning. A GM may not contact you
     before disciplinary action is taken. 

   - For categories 3 through 13, the GM will contact you either in game
     or via email to notify you of the character's name change. Please be
     aware that if you do not choose a name that is in accordance with
     this naming policy at the time of creation a new name will be
     assigned to your character and this name will not be changed. After
     your name is changed, those corpses will not be lootable, and no 
     reimbursements will be given. 

Now, let's say I try to create a character named "Osama."  Which name
type does he fall under?  I think it's obvious that it falls under
group 3.

What is the penalty for such a name?  Well, per the TOS, category 3 says
the name will be changed.  Suspension is reserved only for category 1
and 2 (as you noted).

Let's look at the naming FAQ.

   Offensive names: This includes rude, profane (swear), or vile words.
   It also includes racial slurs, sexually offensive terms, and
   references to the anatomy. A name that sounds like an offensive word
   (homonym) when sounded out will also be considered unacceptable.
   Commonly known abbreviations for offensive words will not be allowed.
   Combinations of names that result in an offensive phrase or word are
   also off-limits. Repeated attempts to create a character with a name
   in this category can result in a warning or banning, so please be
   mature and don't attempt to get these through the filter. If you do
   make a character with a name that violates this policy the character
   will be deleted, and your account may be subject to suspension or
   banning depending on the nature of the name. 

(First off, this is the only reference of suspension in the FAQ.)

How are offensive names defines?  Rude, profane (swear) vile, racial
slurs, sexually offensive terms, anatomy, homonyms of offensive words,
commonly know abbreviations (WTF), and combinations that make offensive
phrases or words.

At no point is historical names referenced.

So, per to TOS, repeated attempts at creating a name like "Osama"
(or even "Rumsfeld," "Daschle," or "Lott") would result in either
(a) the name being denied or (b) the character being created then
a GM changing the name.

Suspension?  Not per the TOS.
