10 WIS, actually, and 12 AC, plus a big batch of disease
protection (25), and a charge of Superior Healing.  Very
nice "cloak" indeed.

But while it is camped a lot, I didn't run into nearly
as much competition on my Aegis of Life quest as I have
on both the Fishbone Earring (Hadden in Qeynos Hills)
and the Testament of Vanear (Dyllin Starsine in High Pass).

And even those are probably outdone in the "most camped"
category by the Ancient Cyclops in South Ro, for the
Journeyman's Boots quest.
