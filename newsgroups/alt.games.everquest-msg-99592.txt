No, that isn't a very good analogy, because the bus can stop both at
the next town over and at the town you're going to.  A better analogy
is a train pulling into the next town over to the one you want
(because that town has tracks and a railroad station and your town
doesn't).  You're expected to get the rest of the way on your own.

The druid should have /told you, "BBM, ok?"  But BBM is such a
*common* substitute for GFay that it probably didn't occur to him or
slipped his mind.  That's one transgression for him, and a pretty
minor one at that.

However, you didn't do a /who, apparently either didn't know that only
wizards can port to GFay or were incapable of telling what class the
guy was when he's standing in front of you, and had no clue how to get
from the BBM druid ring to GFay.  I count more transgressions on your
side.

I take it you've never had to actually walk anywhere?

I'm with Ben, I think this is a ridiculous complaint.
