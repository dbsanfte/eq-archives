For those of you wondering who my friends are on TP:

  RL friends/co-workers I sometimes play with (identified
by number, as it would not be polite to release their names)

  Player #1 runs Gorant, a 65 shaman, and Luzipher, fiftysomething
Iksar SK. I believe he also has a druid and a rogue, neither of
whom I have seen.

 Player #2 runs Zkar, 62 monk; Monty, 64 druid; Ekho,
fifty-something bard who recently completed his epic; Zekaria,
6 bard he uses as a bazaar mule; and Clerissa, 59 cleric.
He is none too happy with the recent melee "rebalancing"
and grumbles he may not play Zkar again until the nerfs are
retracted. He wrote a rip on "12 Days of Christmas", called
"The 12 Days of Balance", and posted it to the message boards
at Monkly Business (signs his name Zk4r).

  Player #3 runs Pulast, low-fifties druid, and Ceam, enchanter.

  Player #4 just likes to goof around mostly; he has pissed off
people on three servers. What some people call a "toon", he calls
a "frabish"; same meaning and usage as "thingamajig". He claims to
have about six characters on TP, of which I know: Krik Frabish, 65 mage;
Klavyn Frabish, 60+ bard; Frabb, 58 monk; Amezz, 26 enchanter;
Licce, 26 necro; and a beastlord.

  Of those I know or who know me only online:

  Growltigger Bouncyflouncy was once in a few parties in DSP
with my warrior, but we have since drifted.

  Shampu Saotome I have written of, but it seems she is no longer
played. One of her friends, a Sir Nolians (who may or may not belong
to the same player as Molians) seemed to remember me on occasion
as well.

  One notable player who remembered me from camping the Splitpaw
spires in South Karana, and again from OT and DL, has several characters
named "-unicorn": Angelicunicorn, Powerfulunicorn, Darkunicorn,
Singingunicorn, and probably others.

  Mostly, I have not yet gone out of my way to make permanant friends
online, as my characters' levels are low and I want something to offer
for regular groups. For the same reason I have put off joining a
guild. That, and I worry that a guild will force me to spend most of my
time on one character and leave the others in mothballs, never to level
again. And, of course, I haven't found yet which guilds are popular,
which are regular raiders, which are elemental-flagged, etc. If there's a
site that can tell me exactly the status of all the guilds on a server, I'd
appreciate if someone could link it, though I'm resigned to hoofing it
around the web for info like this.
