I have seen people attacking soulbinders.  But I never see the soulbinder
attacking back.  Has anyone ever attacked one of these things.  I seen
soulbinders in Kelethin and Freeport both being attacked but just standing
there and taking it.  By the way, it is hard to get a bind if the soulbinder
is being attacked.
