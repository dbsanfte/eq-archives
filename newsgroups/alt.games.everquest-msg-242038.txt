No

are

on

| control-alt-delete to get out of this loop.  I log back on and try my CLE

| Who do I contact?
| Will it reset?  (I have not logged on yet but I will after I send this
post)

| Thanks for all the help.

it *might* sort itself out when the servers are rebooted for the patch ...
are you dying instantly each time you return to your bind-point? .. if you
are and the server reset doesn't fix it you'll need to log on with a
different character, make a new one if you don't have another already, and
either /petition or /bug

I seem to remember reading a post in here about poison spells not wearing
off when you die so it could be fixed in this patch

Why would you find it and keep on looking??!
