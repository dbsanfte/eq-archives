This is about my third draft... and still not exactly what I want to say,
but close enough so bear with me.

First, each time we click that agree button on the EULA, we are agreeing
that Verant and SOE own all of our characters, names and all.  I don't think
that Verant would make a huge stink if we used our own character names in
published writing, but if they really wanted to get anal about it, they
could.

For all intents and purposes, EQ is copyrighted and all of their work is
being sold on ebay by someone who doens't even own it.  Regardless of my
view and who owns what, I have legally agreed that Verant owns my characters
when I click on that I Agree button each and every time I log in.

As a writer (with quite a few damn good editors) I am reactionary when it
comes to copyright infringement.  Currently, 10 of my short stories on
available to the paying public on a site that I neither agreed to give
publishing rights to, nor who asked my permission to use my stories.  My
hard work is being stolen and I have been fighting them tooth and nail.
Each time a character is auctioned off on Ebay or any other auction site,
they are making money off of data that was not written by them, but instead
by employees of Verant.  Verant paid these employees for their work, but
these employees are getting no reimbursement when it comes to player to
player auctions.

Now, I also don't like it for another reason.  I play a damn decent Bard.  I
worked hard to play my bard and build my reputation and my class's
reputation.  When someone sells a level 60+ bard to some ninny who doens't
know his ass from his armpit, it lowers the reputation of every bard.  It
lowers the credibility of almost every player out there.  It makes it
difficult for good, decent players to maintain adesire and want to play when
there are a load of characters who are just sold and bought.  Why should i
work my ass off getting a suit of singing steele when when someone else just
bought it with their character?  Why should I conitnue to play when at any
given time I go for a pick up group I might have to group with an ebayer who
is clueless when it comes to his character?  This is primarily just a rant
based completely upon bitter grapes, but the previous argument is bother
sound and unbiased, it is also the legal reasoning behind it.

There is a reason there is a Berne Convention in regards to Copyright, and
there is a reason that a lot of countries enforce it, and there is a reason
that for those countries who ignore it are constantly at the receiving end
of minor sanctions.  Copyright is not only a US law, but an international
law as well.
