it is in this manner, raids leaving certian peoples bodies in "raids gone
bad", that my guild has aquired members who now are very loyal.  Never leave
a guild mate hanging.  A good moto to stick by.

Many times a person will explain the situation and we help, and our reward,
a great new guild member.

Not only is it fun, but makes guild chat wonderfully dangerous too.  Not
sure how many times my husband has been informed of my paladin's flirting
and games of strip poker....

one of my favorite rules...

Always help a newbie who isn't asking for help.  Be it advise or that nice
fine steel weapon you were just going to sell to a vendor.
