The amount of exp needed per AA is static (same as a lvl 51). The amount you
earn per mob isn't.
Your Level vs Mobs' Level determines how much % you get of his exp. If you
kill a 100 certain mobs at level 51 for an aa ding you need 105 of those at
level 52 and 110 at level 53 for instance.
The difference is that at level 53 you don't kill the same mobs but slightly
higher so it evens out and because the mob gives more exp (higher mobs tend
to have more exp) you would only need 95 of those.

This is what probably spread the rumour of higher level taking longer per
aa. People who farmed FG for aa's at 60 got like 1 aa per 2 hours. If you
kill the same mobs at level 65 you're still bound to the respawnrate mostly
and can still kill the same amount of mobs, but they're lower level so you
only get like 70% of the exp you got at 60 per kill. Meaning the same spot 5
levels higher can take an hour more to get you your aa ding.

For your plan, another reply explains why anything besides 100% aa or 0% aa
is best :).
Only exception to that is maybe at level 65 putting 10% level / 90% aa exp
for a while. Level exp doesn't give any advantage anymore but you still want
to keep a buffer up for the times you die. Though most people just do 100%
level exp till 2 yellow or so then switch to 100% aa while their level exp
remains above 1 yellow bub after rezzes.
