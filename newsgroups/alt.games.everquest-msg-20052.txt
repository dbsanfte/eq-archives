I was looking to debunk his story, but thought this would be funnier.


July 7, 2001

The Orange County Register


Police usually don't recommend that women attack armed assailants, but a
Laguna Hills woman did just that, and the Orange County sheriff on Friday
lauded her courage.

A man slipped though a sliding glass door and surprised a 32-year-old woman
who was reading in bed the night of July Fourth.

The man held a knife and told the woman to take off her pants.

But she didn't. When his pants fell around his ankles, she fought.

"She scratched, she pushed, she grabbed his genital area," said Sheriff
Michael Carona. "She did everything possible to prevent a rape and possibly
death."

The woman took the man's knife and escaped.

A day later, police arrested a suspect, Jesus Navarro Corona, 27.

He is being held in Orange County Jail on charges of burglary, assault with
a deadly weapon and attempted rape.

The woman was housesitting when she was attacked. She described the
assailant to the family for whom she was housesitting, and they said he had
been seen around the apartment complex.

Police partially identified the suspect by scratches on his neck and
shoulders.

The woman initially agreed to talk to reporters, but she changed her mind
after being traumatized while identifying the suspect in a live lineup.

The sheriff said that although the department doesn't "advocate attacking
people with knives," he said the woman "took a bold move and she succeeded
in stopping the rape."

Dawn Foor, prevention educator at the Sexual Assault Victim Services center
in Santa Ana, agreed.

"Inside, I'm saying 'All riiigght, sister,' " Foor said. "I wouldn't say
officially women should grab assailants' testicles. She had the opportunity
and she was thinking.

"We tell women, 'Listen, no matter what you did, if you are here the next
day breathing, you did the right thing.' "
