No they are just a Status symbol. With a SOW poition you have 30 minutes
inside. For a horse that equals the speed of a SOW at level 30 would cost at
least 15k, the 10k horse is equal to Jboots or Travellers Boots which can be
gotten via Multiquest or purchased cost 5k. Nice thing about the horse
though is it can be sold back with about a 10% loss with high Cha (buying
and selling).
