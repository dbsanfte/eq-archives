I had excitement playing my dark-elf enchanter at about level 5 or 6.
I was doing the newbie armour quests and died or nearly died a good
number of times before I got the technique for killing the weakest of
those mages you need to get for the blood stained cloaks.  The problem
was that I would target her and fire off a spell then she would fire a
spell at me.  Then shiney bob would run in and get killed too quickly.
Then I tried the same and then ran in to help bob but that would put me
too close to another, higher level, mage who would nuke me.  The
technique I worked out was to not summon my pet until after I had
attacked the low level mage.  When she nuked me then started to run in
I would summon my pet and we could both take her out quite safely then.
 That was exciting and challenging at a very low level.

I had a similar challenge this morning in WoW.  I was attacking a level
15 raptor (I'm was 12 at the time).  I sent my pet in and fired my bow
abilities as usual.  The pet got eaten up very quickly and then shortly
after so did I.  For some reason I decided that I needed to succeed
against this raptor.  I died another couple of times before I
remembered that I had some glue that could be used as a root.  Using
this I could keep him off me for a while and I could heal my pet and/or
get a another of my higher damage bow abilities off.  That was also
challenging but I'm not sure that it was as exciting as the EQ1 example
from before.

It could just be a case of remembering the good times to be better than
they were.  I don't know.

But even when you have decided that you are going to win this one it
could all go horribly wrong with a bad set of HOs.

I've not played a warrior or a rogue yet although I do intend to play
both at some point.  I always intended to play a rogue because I had
heard about the combo points and finishing moves and thought that it
sounded good.

But, if the boneheads get you killed the experience debt sharing is
good.  If you are the tank, then the boneheads could very easily get
YOU killed and then the shared exp debt makes them take some of the
pain.  Also, if you are the healer then a bonehead tank could easily
get you killed too.

I had a bad night in WoW last night I must have died 5 or 6 times
trying to get the quest item from Fizzle.  I levelled shortly after and
couldn't afford to buy all my new abilities.  The monetary penalty of
death in WoW is a fairly serious penalty but you don't necessarily feel
the pain until much later.  That disascociates the pain from the cause
of the pain.  I didn't even realise why I was so short of cash until I
read your post.

I'm not saying that losing your corpse is fun - the are, usually, far
from fun - I'm suggesting that the chance of losing your corpse
increases the excitement of the game.
