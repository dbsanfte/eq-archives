Nah, my notion of skill is reasonably clear:  an ability or
technique developed through practice, like athletic techniques
or high-speed typing or playing a musical instrument.  As to the
reason for asking the question, I am honestly curious and I am
very satisfied with the variety of responses I've read so far.

Well, that's not particularly satisfying.  I'm having trouble
understanding what "communication between you and the server"
and "knowledge built into the game" have to do with "skill
involved in playing EQ".

Good, I should've thought of that right off.

I'm not clear on the skill involved here.

This one is interesting, there is obviously some skill involved
in coping with multiple adds quickly.  Never having played a
character beyond L17 who had more than root, single-target stun,
and agro kiting available as CC tools I've not had experience
comparable to a veteran Enchanter.

Is there skill here? or is it just a matter of following a recipe?

Might involve skill, I dunno, but it's not exactly the sort of
gameplay I had in mind.   :-p

Well, at least it's more pertinent than corpse art, I think.

Nice example, too bad visual tracking is so undependable due to lag
and warping.

Now there's a valuable skill!  Annie should take lessons...

Aha, I knew you'd resort to a Bard technique!  No, you misunderstand
me.  Learning (practicing) how to do swarm kiting is the acquisition
of a skill.  Actually swarm kiting is the use of a skill.  If it
weren't a Bard thing :-p this would be exactly what I'm asking for
examples of.

Part of what I want to learn is whether my understanding of the
meaning of the word "skill" deviates substantially from others'.
