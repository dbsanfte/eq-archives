I was in a fast pulling group in PoI this evening.  Things were going well
until 9:14 pm ET.  For some reason I was unable to cast.  The MA (a 57
Pally) had just pulled an obsolete model and I couldn't cast a heal.  It
didn't fizzle, spells just wouldn't cast.  Based on the shouts and OOC's
every caster in the zone was unable to cast.

We made haste to the zone to lose the aggro.  Zoning corrected the problem.
