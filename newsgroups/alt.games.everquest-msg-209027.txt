Duo with a bard.

If there's anything better for a Necro's downtime than a song that heals
both health and mana, I can't imagine it.  (Works on shamans too).  Bard can
harmo-pull neatly.  Bard can twist three DoT songs for some very nasty
damage if you dont' want to melee; my bard gets 62x3 / tick at level 52.  If
you're fearkiting, the bard can walk behind the mob meleeing and twisting in
fearsong - when your fear drops, the song will pick up without the mob
having time to do more than turn around.

Bards are like Bacos - they make every salad better.  :)
