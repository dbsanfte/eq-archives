It's hard to see how the amount of platinum in one's EQ bank is an original
work of authorship.

I don't see how anyone has a property interest in it.  I don't see anything
different between this and, say, an online chess game.  If I am playing on
an online chess service, and move my rook to f4, I don't see how my rook
being on f4 is intellectual property of the company running the chess
server, and if someone pays me to move my rook from f4 to a4, I don't see
how there could be an IP issue--just a contract issue, and maybe a tort
issue between the game company and the people paying me to violate my
contract.
