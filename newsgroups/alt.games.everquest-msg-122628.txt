Start in Freeport and get around 30 deathfist belts from EC, acquire shared wolf from
a friendly druid and hand them in to a named Captain of the milita in WF militia
guild upstairs, until you get two faction raises (will go from glower dubiously to
apprehensive then indifferent while in wolf form), this gets you to dubious. Don't do
more than you have to 'cos it ruins NFP guard faction.
Then collect lots of orc pawn picks and give to Hallard in Hallards resellers in EF,
4 at a time. Do this around 70 times (yes, that many) and you will be mostly able to
wander north Freeport (guards are paladins I think) to bank and access supplies.
While in EF and wolfed, head to a bar behind the Soulbinder and find a bard named
Fabian and give him around 20pp in 2 gold increments at a time (don't stack), and
this will increase some bard faction for later travel around Qeynos (trust me you
will need this faction for Q).
Now head to the monk guild in West Freeport with lots of stacks of components
required for the first sash or headband quest for Freeport. They are easy to find,
most vendors have stacks from lowbies. Do this quest enough times to raise your
faction with the monk guild Ashenfist and the other one (can't remember it's late
;P).

That's Freeport, now Qeynos. Head to Blackburrows and slay lots and lots of gnolls
and collect their fangs. Some pelts were used too, may pay to research that on the
net. Hand in the fangs to a named guy overlooking the arena in SQeynos (in wolf form
again), 4 at a time for facton with the guards and maybe merchants. He gives you a
moonstone for each fang and you can hand them into a bartender somewhere close by for
more faction and a bottle of booze!! This does good-guard and merchant faction for
qeynos.
Then do the monk headband/sash quest in wolf form in NQ.
I never bothered with the bad-guards faction, they are all green to me and won't
attack now but watch out for Lieutenant Dagnorak in NQ near the monks, he can HT you
hard!!
And you better hope you did bard faction now 'cos theres a female bard that wanders
SQ and she will thrash you silly.
Other notable people I never bothered to get faction with are the Clerics of NQ and a
couple roam so be awake, and some casters in SQ who also roam.

Think that's all, implement sneak if wolf form isn't enough faction for monk quests
and have the druid at hand at all times to refresh wolf, you are gonna be clicking
away at some NPC's for hours :)

I'm sure there's easier and faster ways to do this, but this is how I did it and it
does take patience. But imho kudos to any Iksar in Freeport or Qeynos !!

Good luck.
