What are the faction issues for a Necromancer in HHP?  If he's not KOS, he
should only need to be invisible near the zone in to pass the Orcs, and near
the zone out, to pass the Gnolls.  On the zone out side, even if it drops at
a bad time, he should be able to just run for the zone.

Pretty much everywhere else on the run to the NK spires, it shouldn't matter
if invis drops, because he doesn't need to go near anything.  Once down from
the ramp in EK, it is a pretty short run to the bridge, over flat territory
with excellent visibility.  Once in NK, the route south along the river, and
then east along the water won't run into anything other than some bandit
camps, which are not hard to avoid.

So, as long as he's not KOS in HHP, there are two places where he would be
depending on invis, both of which only need 5-10 seconds of invisibility,
and are near zones to run to if he gets in trouble.  (And if he does this
during a crowded time, the Orcs and Gnolls might be too busy to care about
someone running by).
