Did you check on the trader itself, or just through the Bazaar window? Augs
don't show up in the bazaar window, since FV is the only server that allows
the sale of them or items with them. That's why oftentimes you'll do a
search for a stat in the bazaar on FV, see 2 items that seem identical when
you examine them through the bazaar window but have different numbers for
the stat you're seeking (example: Looking up Shield of Dragonkind with wis
being the searched stat turns up 2 instances, where in the bazaar window,
one shows up as 15 wis, the other as 21 wis, but when you inspect both
items, you just see 15 wis unless you go to the trader himself and look at
the item via browse, where you'll see the +6 wis aug).

Butcherblock has always been a good place for my newbie characters to make
decent money, especially if you don't mind the 'stink' skunks will give you.
