Oooo...don't say that in sci.math. They HATE that.  :)  [In my best
condescending though very dweeb-like imitation..."It is NOT an
equation, it is an expression, and expressions are NOT equivalent,
they are equal...*whine, nitpick, whine*..."] I never had so much fun
being ridiculed. Though I'm not normally in favor of trolling, now I
can see where it may have it's merits.  :)

Anyway, thanks again for setting me straight.
