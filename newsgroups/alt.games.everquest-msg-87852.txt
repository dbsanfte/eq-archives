Which is why I added the following immediately after that
statement which you snipped for some reason:

"Unless you can prove they violated your civil rights -- and you have
NO right to free speech on someone else's computer systems -- you're
SOL if they ban you."

Since it's highly unlikely that a GM would have any idea about
a player's race, creed, country of origin, etc. it's going to be
damn near impossible to prove any violation of civil rights.

The whole idea of "some consumer protection authority" or any
governmental unit stepping in because someone was banned
from EQ is ludicrous.
