depends on what you like playing.  there is no "best character" at all.
None.  They are all the best at *something*.

pick something you want to play and go with it.


I will say though, if you plan on playing SOLO, pick Druid, Wizard or
Necromancer.  There are a couple of other classes that can solo fairly well,
but those three are best at it.

best advice I can give you is to try several toons and see which you like
best.
