POW! You and a shaman will get fine exp with almost no risk in
Burning Woods, just one zone away.  Add another melee (or
better, a ranger for SoW and tracking) and you'll get exp so fast
it's scary.

PU groups are fun...but real exp comes in partnering and trios.
You'd be surprised how quick a duo or trio can get exp.

Example: My best friend in my alt rogue's guild is a ranger-gal.
When Luclin opened up, both of us were level 51.  We went
from about halfway through 51 to 53 AND an AA level apiece
(wondered about Run skill) in about 3 days just on rockhoppers
after we found out they fear-kited with animal spells.

Downtime was almost nil, as she had a Fungi and I had an
invigorate BP...plus the fact that the mobs were running away
snared 95% of the time.  Med time was camo'd her/hidden
me while we went to pee or got something to drink.

Only exp quicker is level 1 ;-).
