I understand that logic, but here is mine.  On a true roleplaying server
the number of idiot PKs should be small enough that the vast majority
can make their lives hell instead  of the other way around.  In building
the environment (making up the rules) I would focus on things that make
the grief player as uncomfortable as possible and as unable to
accomplish his goal as possible.  I do understand that what I envision
is a much more complex effort than VI is willing to make at this time

Oh and as for RPers being marked for death on Sullon.... well I guess
the Good Rogue (I know, that just doesn't seem right) I created on
Sullon last night is in for a rough life.  He wants to see peace between
Good and Neutral so he can worship at the Qeynos temple and get back to
his guild.  His shouts of "Cease this endless conflict and seek
salvation at the Temple of Life!" haven't gotten him killed yet, but I
have a feeling tonights the night hehe.
