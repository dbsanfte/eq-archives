I'd taken a couple of months off the treadmill, and logged for the first
time this morning.  I found no one in any of the areas that used to be
standard for a 13th lvl DE necro (EC, Lava, etc.).  I don't mean just a few,
less than normal ... I mean no one. Zip.  Zilch.  Nada.  I was the only
player in the zones.

Pulled out my 54 druid, and found that there were tons of folks in the
planes.

Not meaning to sound alarmist or anything, just wondering ... has anyone
seen an honest-to-goodness newb in a while?
