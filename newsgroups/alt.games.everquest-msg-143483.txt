I know somebody posted a link to a private e-mail from Rich about this,
but I wasn't sure if everyone saw his post on Sony's boards in the news
section. Taken from:


Here's what Rich had to say:

Some big changes on Test right now include the introduction of some new
healing spells for priest classes. This is a sticky topic with many
players, especially as it's left clerics with concerns about their
desirability to groups and raids. The decision to make some changes to
clerics has been a long time coming and much debated before we decided
to move ahead with it. Clerics are an unusual class as at high levels
they become mandatory for raid encounters, but often are thought of as
unneeded in high level groups, and lack the ability to solo efficiently.
With the  introduction of some better raid-level heals for shamans and
druids, clerics can be assured that we're intending to give them more
versatility and greatly improve their group and solo roles. It should be
possible to have any priest class function as an effective healer, but
if you want the best and most efficient healing you'll always get that
from a cleric. I'll stop by the cleric board and make a post about more
of the cleric specific concerns, but you can be certain that the new
heal spells for the other priests are not going to make clerics obsolete
by any stretch of the imagination - expect for the role of a cleric to
become more entertaining, versatile, and valued soon.

head every 15 minutes. Over all, it's certainly less painful, and very
probably more productive."
