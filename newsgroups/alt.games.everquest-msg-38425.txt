I don't think this is related, could be. Read a post <on a web site I think
it was>. Guy was complaining about his account being hacked and VI straight
arming him about the ban. He said he resolved it by hacking into EQ and
sending the info to VI to get his account reinstated.

His story had a happy ending, like his account was reinstated. I'm thinking
his story and the happy ending, relative to 5 years in the federal pen, only
happens in  fairy tales.
