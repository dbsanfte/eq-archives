From what I hear, it doesn't stack past the FT15 cap, but otherwise it
should stack just fine.

Also, regarding costs, you don't waste pp for it, you donate items. You can
find lots of cheap items in bazaar for less than 100pp that will give over 
one thousand tribute points. The Greatstaffs of Thunder (28k points), Mace of
the Fallen Crusader (13k points) and similar quickly disappeared from the
bazaar, along with similar common drop weapons with recommended/required
levels, but there's still plenty of deals left that are much better than
paying 1 pp per point.
