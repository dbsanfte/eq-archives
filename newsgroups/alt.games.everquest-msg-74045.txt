Not if I make it :)
I charge only self cost, and more often I have just equipped some
newbie who happened to be unlucky enough not to escape me
with a full set of banded because I wanted to work on blacksmithing
a bit :) I know that isn't the most efficient way to increase skill,
but I prefer it when I know that my crafted artwork is actually
of some use instead of just being sold to a vendor :)

(I must admit though, that I went from 134 to 160 with just
banded cloaks, being a chicken :)

Best Regards,

   Maliciosa Do'Urden on Antonius Bayle
      - send me a tell if you need banded for self cost...
