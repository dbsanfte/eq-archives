This is also amusing as it confuses the heck out of newbies (and some not so
newbies). I tend to train up my casting skills while standing outside the
tunnel in EC checking the market. I shoot flares and try to hit different
trees. Of course I miss so these flares are shooting out all across the
zone. Seen more then a few /ooc "WTF is that?" and had some curious folks
track the flares back to me.

Another point is that the spellcast recycle time is fixed. It does not
matter if you shoot into a wall 5 feet away or across the entire zone. It
takes just as long to be able to cast again. So have some fun with it.
