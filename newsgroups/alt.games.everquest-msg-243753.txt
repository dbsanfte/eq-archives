My favorite 'young days' enemy is that little bee-yotch ThistleBrush who
zips around lesser Faydark.  Camped at the merchant place, south center,
went to get coffee, came back just in time to see him finish me off.

Took the time to look him up on Alakazam, and found that he has a rare drop
focus item on top of other loot, which just made me want him more.  First
three times I went after him had to run but finally got him, and now,
sometimes on my way to and from LDoN in Mistmoore, at level 51 take a minute
to trash him again.
