Are you being deliberately obtuse?  I'm not trying to be rude here, I'm 
trying to explore your problem and help you solve it... or failing that 
to let you educate me as to why my solutions don't apply to a rogue, 
which is a class I haven't played past 12 or so.

OK, well this thread was about LDoN.  It is 100% true that if all you 
want is a group, that if you have 2 people you already have a group. 
But if by "group" you mean "5 or 6 people" then my theory appears to 
still stand.  Groups can either be formed whole, by sitting and waiting 
till you get everyone you need, or they can accrete, starting solo, duo, 
trio, quad... till you have what you need to go do whatever you really 
wanted to do, be it LDoN, Crushbone, ELementals...

Hmm, anything that your partner can solo, of course.  As an example,
my mage was duoing on goos in POD the other day at 49, with a
paladin partner.  Pally was high enough level that he could solo
them, so all I had to do was speed him up, which I could easily do
with DS, pet (pet was hitting for its full damage) and nukes (my
nukes were also landing for full).  I wouldn't have a giant bat's
chance in Chardok of soloing there, as my pet would die in far less
time than a rogue tank but in a duo I was doing well over half the
damage.

A rogue would doubtless have a harder time of this, since you'd NEED a 
partner who can melee solo or do a Very good job of keeping aggro in a 
hate kite.

But POP isn't the only game in town, if you have a healer partner I'm 
reasonably sure you can find non planar content thats low dark blue 
which you can go toe to toe with, less efficiently than with a "real" 
tank standing in that spot, but my thesis proposes that you go for -any- 
exp camp with whatever partner you find available and grow up to a real 
group from there.
