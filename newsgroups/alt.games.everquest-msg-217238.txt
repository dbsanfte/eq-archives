The old model Ogres look far better than the new ones.  They looked
distinctly non-human.  The new ones just look like fat humans.  At a
distance, it's hard (for me anyway) to tell the difference between an Ogre
warrior and a Barbarian warrior.

As for the old versus new Erudites, the old Erudite females were quite sexy.
The new ones all look seriously butch.
