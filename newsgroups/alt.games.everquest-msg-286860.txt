I haven't been able to log in for the last hour or so. I can't even
access the everquest site to get info.  It goes through the patcher or
whatever it's called now, gets to the point where you have to click on
play, then I get a message to see if I'm connected to the internet. I
am, every other site works and is accessible.

I was able to play very early this morning, but after that there were
some files from that card game that were updated and since then, no
access to EQ..........
