If you leave one song playing, it pulses and effect every few seconds, and
the effect lasts a few seconds after the song stops.

This means if you play song 1, wait for it to pulse, stop it, play song 2
and wait for it to pulse, both effects are up at the same time, even though
you're only playing the songs sequentially.

You then stop song 2 and start song 1 again.  Repeating this gives you two
bard songs in effect.  That's twisting.

You can twist three songs, to have three effects up all at the same time,
even though you're still only playing the bard songs one after another.

The trick is to time it so that you restart each song before the effect
from that song stops.

If you're good, you can twist 4 songs.

People have suggested they can twist 5 in lag free situations.

Songs with varying lengths can affect how you do the twisting.
