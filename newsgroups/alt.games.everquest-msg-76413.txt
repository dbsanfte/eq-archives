  Wouldn't surprise me, but usually I can see things from their point
of view.  In this case, though, I really can't.

  That may be so, but I don't think it's such a terrible thing that
some NPCs lie.  None of the "burynai bundt cake" NPCs explicitly lie.
I really don't see a big deal... one NPC asks for a burynai bundt
cake... if you never find a burynai bundt cake, you lose nothing.  If
you bother to research the quest (either in game or out of game: a
common sense place to look for information on how to complete a FV
quest that seems to involve baking would be to hail the NPCs in the
baker's store, right?) then you find out that it's not really a quest.

  I don't know.  On the one hand, I like these little non-quests.  I
do think they add a bit of flavor, and I like quests where you have to
do a bit of "critical thinking" to figure out that an NPC is being
misleading or deceptive.  I think quests where you just follow the
bracketed keywords, kill the indicated mobs and wait for the drop are
boring.  On the other hand, that is what Verant over the years has
conditioned us to expect from their quests.  Now they're trying
somewhat to get away from that, but they're cursed by their previous
failures (as well as their fresh, new failures).

  Personally, I long ago gave up trying to pioneer and discover quests
in game.  I'll sometimes hail NPCs because I'm bored, or complete a
quest I'm told about, but otherwise I use spoiler sites all the way,
so I don't really worry too much about these things anymore.
