They are situational but the listings in the hunting guides at
http://necro.eqclasses.com often say what spells people are using.  I
was fighting mostly undead at 12 so i kept the undead nuke memed in
place of I think fear.  I also was grouping in unrest at 12 and would
often replace leach and poison bolt with siphon strength and impart
strength.  I was with a magician, a ranger and sometimes a wizard.  I
would siphon strength from the mob making it hit for less, then impart
strength to the ranger, the magician pet, and my pet.  While str doesn't
effect attack much, every little bit helps at those low levels where it
seems more pronounced.  Otherwise that seems pretty close to what i was
keeping memmed.  I also at 12 was finding heat blood very expensive and
sometimes would replace that with dark empathy to heal the ranger during
fights, since i generally was not getting aggroed on.  Between me, and
his low level heal, we were able to overlook the lack of a healer at
that level.
