You are the second person to suggest fear without snare.  How does this 
work?  Mobs generally run faster than unsowed PC's, as my years of 
trying to flee them tell me.  So if you fear a mob and it runs off 
faster than you can pursue, what good does this do you?

Do chanter pets perhaps run at mob speed?

You don't seem to be picking exclusively on the "slow running" mobs, or 
surely you'd mention it.  So there must be something going on that I'm 
missing.
