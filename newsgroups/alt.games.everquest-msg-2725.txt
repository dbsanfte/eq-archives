The key to practicing safefall is to note that you get a chance of a
skill increase on any fall.  It does not have to be a fall that causes
damage, or potentially causes damage.  It just has to be enough of a
fall for the game to decide you are falling.  You can tell if the fall
is enough by using a third person view and seeing if it switches to the
falling animation.

With that in mind, find a slope that, when you run down, causes falling.
Go partly up the slope, point yourself up, and then hold down your "run
forward" key and your "turn left" (or right) key.  You'll run in a
circle on the slope, falling a little each time around, and getting a
chance at a skill increase.

I don't know of a specific place near Cabilis to do this, but there are
enough hills of varying slope that it should be not too hard to find
one.

I did this on the hills on the side of the ramp to Highpass when
travelling from Freeport to Qeynos, and easily took a neglected safefall
up 15 points very quickly.
