Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the only way to raise OT
outpost faction (Venril Sathir) is by killing certain dragons or named
mobs, or else by doing the quest where you turn in Sarnak warbraids to
Captain Rottgrime, one of the skelly guards, but you can't do the
quest if you're KOS (unless maybe you get an enchanter to charm him
and then do the quest, or use different illusion potions?)

I found the faction/quest for Venril Sathir at:
