Human monks can do the Stonehand armor quests in Freeport.
All those items have STA on them (AFAIK, anyway) and are a
nice upgrade to cured silk.

In general, you only *need* 100 STA for "staying power."  After
that, it's a question of the HPs it generates and becomes a
tradeoff with other stats.   I'd suggest spending a couple of
days (if that) rounding up the parts for the Stonehand armor
and replacing all the cured silk first.   It's cheap (zero cost if
you kill everything yourself) and not very expensive even if you
buy the components for most of it from vendors.   And, at your
level, everything that drops components can be easily solo'd
quickly.   If you have a ranger or druid friend to help track, it'll
be even faster (since you won't have to wander around looking
for the common mobs.)
