Yup, warriors are mostly big HP-bags with some damoutput. Problem today is
that that same warrior will have loads more gear and your pet PLUS your
nukes would still give you about 40% to actually win against that war (when
he first takes your pet and then you). For a **PURE** offensive class as
what the mage is that's crap.

Sort of. lvl 51 earth pet was pretty good, but not that much better then 49
earth or water. Now I am lvl 56 and my pets get a hard time hitting and
doing some damage. Don't even mention the fact that they can't take a
beating at all anymore at this level. The problem is that at lvl 56 the best
pet you have is the lvl 54 water, which is the same level as the lvl 51
earth, which was pretty decent at lvl 51...

I;m just grateful I got my hands on a Burnout IV for cheap (3kpp), but I
heard not all mages are that lucky before, oh, lvl 58 or so.

At 54 you're still playing with a pet which is basically hitting as well as
a lvl 51 pet. Things get notably worse. At lvl 55 and 56 you don't get a pet
so that's where it really hurts.

At the Tower there are also loads of lvl 55+ mages who complain.
I know we're crap in the end game and every caster is nowhere near as
effective as a melee, but I'm keeping hope. Especially the focus items look
really neat and I'm hoping that VI will implement more caster balancing
things in the game soon.
Who knows, maybe our pets will actually be worth the risk in hate some
day...
