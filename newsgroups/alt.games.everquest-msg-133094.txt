A while ago they updated this when they patched to make life easier at lower
levels.
I know Low lvl SK's and Necro's get a lesser summon corpse spell that will
summon upto 35th level (requires cheap coffin, I believe sold in Oasis)
There is the dropped 39th Necro spell from Split Paw, I don't have it but do
have a Necro who can cast it if I bought it. I believe this one requires the
full sized coffins from Neriak.
Isn't there another one? an Improved Summon Corpse that requires only the
smaller, stackable coffins? I can find nothing on Casters realm (I thought
it was a 51st level spell) was it changed at all in the patch?

Really need to know what I require for a necro (or SK) to summon my corpses.
I doubt I am going to have the time to wait on a petition tonight (I
wouldn't actually log in at all if it wasn't that I don't really want 3
corpses stuck under the world when they patch next) so am gonna have get
player help (which is best requested when you have all components and plat
to donate)

TIA
