Ferrot (misspelled as a courtesy to ogres) is the best spiderling
silk area, as all spiders there drop spiderling, so anything with
8 legs is fair game.  They are also probably most prevalent there,
although Everfrost is another good source, and if you don't have
track it might be easier to farm there.  Key is to kill all the low level
mobs, as otherwise you build up more and more goblins and
so forth, and fewer spiderlings.
