I know what he said, and I don't agree with it. It might apply to some 
extent for those going directly from the x-box FPS and Mario type games, but 
even there I have my doubts.

I have read and re-read his article several times, and the more I read it, 
the less I think that he is onto to something. He seems to be trying to 
translate the world of MUD's directly over to large scale MMORPG's, and it 
does not fly. It is the same type of assumptions in the early days of PC's 
that caused program designers to simply directly translate pen and paper 
book keeping to computers. Then Quickbooks came along and blew them all 
away.
