Around 51, I started trying to max out my WIS.  I carry two bags with resist
gear and stat gear and what not.  Without KEI, I can gear up to 255 WIS for
medding, then swap out according to the fight.  237 is not bad at 51, but
personally, I'd start looking to upgrade WIS a tad.  Here's what I usually
have on me:

I've heard the same thing.  At 51, I went 50/50 on normal/AAXP.  When I'd
get close to ding, I went all normal XP, then slowed back down so I could
stay close in range to my normal fighting group.  At 55, I have 7 AAXP and
fluctuate between percentages depending on how far apart group mates and
myself are.  AAXP definately moves faster at 55 than 51.  I put my first 3
points in Innate Wisdom, and second 3 points into Run 3.  If I had it to do
over again, I'd put first 3 points into Run 3.  It is DEFINATELY an
improvement, and a lot of times I don't notice that SoW/Shrew has dropped.

Cobalt Scar is good for kiting.  I had problems there at 51ish due to the
aggro from the Drakes and what not.  I went and got to CoV faction to
Amiable and that kept them from random adding onto me.  At 55, I can pull a
kite directly over a stationary drake and he will not aggro.  I've not seen
a CoV faction hit for hitting the normal Drakes and I am still amiable, just
don't kill a named one or you will get a CoV hit.  Alternatives that are
good xp are Aviak Island and Raptor Island in Timorous Deep.  Aviaks are
good XP and decent coin and pretty easy.  Raptor Island is great XP, but no
coin and hard to get the hang of, as the Raptors have a huge aggro range.
At 51, you may be able to kite Nathan's guards in Katta Castellum...may be
too low though. I don't remember level on that one.  I did kite them off and
on and made a few levels.  There's a zone pretty close, so you can zone if
it goes bad.  I'm usually alone in Katta Castellum.
