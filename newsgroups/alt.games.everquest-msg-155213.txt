The lack of room to maneuvre to avoid aggro is a very real danger and get's
people killed in very short order. Pathing is also another thing which is
generally much more complicated indoors, as well as issues like "through the
wall aggro". Then you have splain and simple lack of visibility as well.

Give my soloing but a nice vast outdoors zone anyday. The few dungeons I do
routinely use I know like the back of my hand, knowledge which has been paid
for in many a corpse run...
