Hehe, thats okay. I've heard of some people having strange problems, but
thats one of the strangest I've heard. I run it on 98SE and XP, and I've
never had a problem, so I'm very little help when it come to weird stuff
like this, sorry. If you're bored, you can try the beta version on the front
page of my website (again, http://www.execpc.com/~zor/SneakyAmp/ ), it has a
XP related bug fix. But even bugged, it shouldnt do anything that scary. Ah
well. :)
