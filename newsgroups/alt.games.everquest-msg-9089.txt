A mid twenties group of four with that breakdown would *probably* do
pretty well holding the guard room. (Though the shammy is going to turn
into a full time healer most likely).  Trying to hold the warrior room
with that group is insane. We had a group of five in there yesterday
ranging from 27 to 32, and it still got a bit hairy at times.  At the
moment that they announced they were going to pull the raider room, I'd
have bailed.
