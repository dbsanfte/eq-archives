  Allright, I've hear dpeople talk about commands such as

	/doability 1

  alot.  Now, my question is, how do you know/set which ability is ability
1,2,3,4,etc.  And how many can you set?

exterior transtemporal mechanics function when you're dealing with
omni-dimensional ripple effects triggered at the end of a continuum
packet.		- Kurt Busiek
