Sure, I'll grant you that, depending on the group and the situation, 30M may be fine
temporarily, even necessary temporarily; fine if you spent a lot on something unusual, and
can expect to build back up to a healthy point, and necessary if you need to capitalize on
the unusual thing you just did (say breaking a tough camp and need to start killing the
respawns to space things out) and will lose the advantage you just bought if you wait for
mana to come back up.

But thats not what I'm arguing about, its the situation (fantasy or no, it wasn't my
situation to start with) where the puller is capable of maintaining a pull rate that keeps
the healer at 30M every pull for an hour straight.   My point there is there's no reason not
to keep him at 80M instead, plenty of reason -to- keep him at 80M instead.

This reasoning is reinforced by the idea that the camp in question is an LDoN crawl, where
there are no repops to worry about; thats the one advantage to pushing forward LOM; if
sitting where you are means repops, and you want to move forward or to split a spawn out
better by killing one repop early even though you don't really have great mana yet..
Neither instance applies in LDoN.
