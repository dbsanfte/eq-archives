And you're probably advocating diplomacy.  You're probably one of those
people who think that NO military action should be taken in case someone
might stub their toe or get a nosebleed.

Attacking the WTC was an act of terror.

Attacking the PENTAGON was a DECLARATION OF WAR, EXACTLY as Pearl Harbor
was.

Godspeed to those military personnel who play EQ (there are a LOT of them).
Our prayers and well wishes are with you.
