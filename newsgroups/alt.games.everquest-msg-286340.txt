A couple days ago, the guild I'm in on the Combine server did the 
Furious Jailer event a number of times, I was lucky enough (yeah, luck, 
as in we rolled to see which ten people we'd do it for that day) to get 
the Blessed Seeker Pendant, which has a focus that adds 25% to all magic 
based damage.

During the FJ event, an earring drops that has a focus that works like 
improved healing, only better, reportedly a 25% increase in heal size. 
Its a good earring for us otherwise, but the heal increase would be 
icing on the cake I thought. Well, I was outbid for it the times it 
dropped, but afterwards, I went and did some testing.

I got a low level Improved Heal item (mask of the Fall, IH III) and went 
to POI where there are some mobs who can hit me enough to let me see 
heal sizes, but not enough to be scary while I'm trying to experiment.

I also got the "bigger nukes" item, the necklace, reward from the FJ kill.

With neither item on, my level 60 lifetap did consistent damage and 
matching heal. With the necklace on, it did randomly bigger damage, a 
nice improvement, and again the heal size matched precisely, as you'd 
expect. I also got a "blessed seeker pendant glows" message with each cast.

With just the mask, though, the heals still matched the damage, instead 
of being randomly higher. No focus message for the mask, either.

With mask plus pendant, just the pendant activated, the heal still 
matched perfectly whatever random size the tap was for.

Then, thinking that perhaps the mask just doesn't give a message and 
somehow the heal is larger than its reported as, I memmed Dark Empathy, 
that old thing that hits us for 30 damage and heals our target for the 
same. Someone else was working the zone in area, I healed them with DE: 
30 points damage to me, 30 heal to them with nothing on. With the Mask, 
30 points damage to me, 31 heal to them and the mask gives a focus message.

SO, its my conclusion that healing focus items don't count for lifetaps, 
which is sad.

And its not consistent, because I can assure you that AA for heals do 
work; I get crit heals as well as crit nukes on lifetaps, and sometimes 
both, getting over 2K hp back on a nominally 500ish damage tap.

Of course today's patch may alter all that, who knows.


Oh, as a side note, I was doing some fighting later, and noticed the 
Blessed Seeker focus effect works on DOTs as well as on Nukes; Festering 
Darkness, Blood of Discord, any magic based damage you do will be 
enhanced by this effect, not just DD ones. I'm thinking (but haven't 
tried) this includes the anti undead nukes as well.
