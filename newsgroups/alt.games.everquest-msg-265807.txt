Lets take wall of slaughter as an example, it has a little  content, npcs to 
interact with once you get faction up. Wandering place holders that spawn 
wandering named mobs. The problem arises when there are 200 people in the 
zone, and yes I've seen more than that there. Now if they were to break it 
into a population controlled instanced zone it would reduce lag/framerate 
issues, and would give everyone an enjoyable time. If you're friends are in 
a differant instance you could join them.  It seems to me your definition of 
content is all zones should be able to handle 400 plus people, while this is 
nice sounding its not realistic with todays technology, or the graphics 
standards that everyone is clammering for. But then you have to think what 
happens when more people join the game and all of a sudden you have 1000 
people in the zone that was originally designed for 400, you're back to the 
same current problem.
You can have content and you can have interactiveness at the same time you 
have instancing. You commented earlier how you loved unrest untill it became 
overpopulated, well instancing would have fixed this issue by reducing the 
population by splitting off another version of it. and it would still have 
been interactive. heck i've seen over 100 people in unrest at a time in the 
past and that just plane stunk. Instancing can be used in a controlled 
format to help your game experience if you'll give it a chance. They are 
still experimenting with it to find out what people like and how it works 
best.
Oh and as a side note it wasn't the newbies that demanded instances to start 
with, it was the high end guilds that demanded that Time be instanced 
because other high end guilds couldnt get to it, its just the developers 
started off small with instancing to see how it works, consider yourself as 
a beta testers for instanced zones, ldon was the first and now they are 
changing it even more. EQ2 is doing the instanced areas when population goes 
nuts so that people arent spending 2 hours online and not getting a chance 
at a regular mob, or supply node,though it looks like they might have gone a 
little overboard on some of it like instanced crafting though it does remove 
a lot of lag it did kill some socializing. Guess they figure if you're busy 
with a forge hammering out a sword you wont be socializing.
There are positives and negatives to instancing, and to your make more 
content method, and there are ways to blend it so it benifits everyone.
