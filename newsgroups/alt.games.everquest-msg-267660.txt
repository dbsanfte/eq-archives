All three priest classes make incredible soloers, at least up to 20.   And I
certainly see a lot of summoners (mages / necros) out soloing... but at this
stage of the game, every class seems able to solo.   My warrior took out a
white con "meant for a group" encounter today, and has taken out orange con +2
level Solo encoutners in the past.   Blue group encounters and yellow solo
encounters he can do easily.

But I have no idea if that continues to be the case.  In EQ1, even warriors
can solo ok at level 11.

Not up to the point I'm at.  It seems that theres a *lot* of solo content.
But theres also a fair amount of quests and areas that seem off limit without
a group... unless you're several levels overpowered.

If anything, I would complain that they are too mixed.  They repeated the old
"Griffon problem" from EQ1.  It's not as bad, but it's definitely still there.

Not only will he not get experience... he will not be allowed to nuke.   The
second the first damage is done, the encounter is locked.  (Social aggro
doesn't lock, only damage / debuffs).   At that point it becomes impossible to
interfere.   You cannot influence the encounter in any way if you are not in
the group that locked it.  No nuking, no debuffing and no mezzing the mobs, as
well as no healing or buffing the combatants.

> How would you compare the "death penalty" between EQ1 and EQ2?

Probably too early to say.   The death penalty scares me not at all at the
moment... but then the EQ1 death penalty at level 11 is similarly
unfrightening.  Kill one bat and you're back where you started.   In 10 more
levels, the debt / repair costs may become burdensome such that death is
avoided... but not yet.

Both games have corpse runs.   The only difference is EQ2's corpse runs you
get to wear your armor while doing them, EQ1 you run naked.

In EQ1 you have experience loss, in EQ2 you have debt.    As I mentioned
above, I'd say this one is too early to call which is "worse."

In EQ2 you have a monetary penalty as well, while EQ1 has none.   Repair costs
are not prohibative at this level...  my newbie gear costs 1 copper per death
per piece to repair... but I can see where it might become so.   My level 10
quest armor seems to run about 7-8 copper per death per piece, so suddenly
you're talking almost a silver (100 copper) to fix up a death with 10 pieces
of armor, instead of 10 copper.
