You can't be playing.  You must be in your room at the inn.  Being a vendor 
costs at least 5s a week in rent (500c which is worth a heck of a lot more 
in EQ2 than EQ :) ).  To buy stuff you can use centrally located brokers, or 
go to the person's room and buy directly from them (and save on broker 
commission fee if I understand that correctly) but if you do that you likely 
will have to travel to their home town (max of one zone away).
