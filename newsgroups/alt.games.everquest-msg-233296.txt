SHOULD being the key word.  Instead of trying to explain what I've
been told myself, I'll just link to the post on the AllaKhazam forums
where this was discussed.  I'm not the only person who has issues with
the in-game MP3 player either...someone else crashes without fail when
he uses the MP3 player.

For what it's worth, I did check my Device Manager and my sound card
and video card aren't listed as being on the same IRQ.  But I am using
both on-board sound and video, and the video RAM is shared with the
system RAM (so even though I have 2 256 MB sticks of RAM, Windows only
thinks I have 448 MB because 64 MB is dedicated to the video card). 
So perhaps that is part of the problem.

Game on,
