From what I understand in a patch they changed the large sewing kits from 8
slot to 10 slot.  Then after players complained that it reduced the value of
the Hand-made backpacks they changed the large sewing kit from 10 slot back
to 8 slot.  Anyone one that had already purchased a large sewing kit that
was 10 slot was renamed a deluxe sewing kit.  So, again from what I
understand, the only way that you can get a deluxe sewing kit is to buy it
from a player.
