Hi Peeps

As my pally was skipping happily through Nektulos Frest the other day, he
happened to spy a "Teir'dal Surveyor", conned blue and dubious at level 33.
Since she looked like a baddie, and since Im a goodie, I chopped her up into
little pieces. I looted a nodrop "Priest of Innoruuk's heart" off her
lifeless corpse. Anyone got any idea what this is for? None of the usual
sites have anything about it. Is it a new spawn? I know I havent seen it
before.
Any constructive comments would be appreciated.
