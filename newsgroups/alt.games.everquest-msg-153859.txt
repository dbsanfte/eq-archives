Hi all,

  Anyone here that plays a bard that has been having lockups since last
patch?  I've heard of lockups with other patches (involving bards) but it's
never seemed to affect my system.  This one has.....it seems that whenever I
twist songs requiring me to swap out instruments that I lockup on the second
instrument swap.

Anyone else?

Sean...

and yes, I have /bugged it.
