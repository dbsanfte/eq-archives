Depends on the raid, to be sure, but I'd say 2/3rd of the raids I've been
on have involved killing an awful lot of mobs, and the 1/3rd that
haven't have only taken a short time to complete, so they didn't eat
much exping time anyway.

I think he and everyone else suggesting that in a raid where
a lot of exp giving mobs are dropped, there isn't any reason
to concern yourself with the exp, are either GETTING the
exp, and part of the conspiracy to pretend it doesn't matter,
or NOT getting the exp, and is a dupe of the system.

I've been in the KS group, its often better exp than a real
exp group, and the loot is exactly the same for members
of the exp group as it is for everyone else on the raid.

If you raid once a week and exp 5 days a week, this isn't
really anything to get bothered about.  So the "damage"
classes get a bonus for raiding that you don't.  But if, as
I have from time to time, you raid 5 days a week and
go out for exp perhaps once, then the "damage" guys
are getting 6 times the exp you are!

If exp was shared around fairly, then raiding would be
just as viable (well probably a bit less viable) an activity
for exp purposes as most real exp groups, and ideas
like multigroup AE would also be quite functional.
