Indeed. It's not like some game you found on the web with some guy
you've never heard of, someplace in the Philippines saying "geev me
total access to yor com-puter please. It ees necessary." Christ
almighty... yeah, no faster way to send your gigantic, multi-national
corporation spiralling straight into the shitter with billions of
dollars in class action lawsuits hot on your ass, than picking over
some poor 15 year old kid's computer and taking control of it....
