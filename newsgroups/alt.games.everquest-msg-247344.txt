I'm in agreement too, as evidenced by my recent cancellation of both my
accounts. It was a good time while it lasted but my fat lady started singing
a while ago. The one interesting question that remains is how many of the

ongoing cycle is old news, and I'm wondering if this is just more of the
same. Or something more like a trend.
