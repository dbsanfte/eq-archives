That's how I'd do it. Getting the odd drive by buff doesn't really 
pervert the experience at all. Its a nice little temporary boost... like 
the doublexp buff, the jester, etc...

As someone who's been doing this for a while I feel qualified to 
comment...my biggest and really only signficant expenses are mounts, and 
as an SK I have some non-trivial epic & spell quest cash requirements 
(life leech and epic quest for SK both need 3k in straight cash as part 
of the quest). I've also had to shell out for gems from time to time for 
various reasons. However, you do not go broke, and gradually amass a 
signficant fortune... by the time I shelled out for life-leech it was a 
very small dent in my pile-o-plat.

So I don't worry about money, I have plenty of plat to fund coffins, and 
what not other daily espenses. Once I've got my cleric a better horse, I 
figure I'll save for a pre-nerf circlet of shadow or something. Its not 
available in the game except for the bazaar so I feel its a legitimate 
cash sink for me... and besides its not like i need anything else.

Other than that... tribute maybe? (although I've learned of several high 
tribute items that are far more efficient to farm) And since I don't 
bazaar sell either I dump a fair number of items that are useless to me 
into tribute that would have gone for several k or more in the bazaar.

I'm sure I'll amass cash ever faster as I gain levels.

That was my objective. And while someone could go for a more extreme 
old-world-only ruleset I do like being able to interact with the rest of 
the playerbase on fairly equal footing. 

At the stage my alts are at I'm well behind the alt-ubertwinks but well 
ahead of most newer/casual players with 60th level mains in just bazaar 
gear and on par or ahead of most "budget alt-twinks" too. If someone 
tried to kit out someone in bazaar gear as good as mine they'd be 
spending at least a couple hundred k. Of course, there are *plenty* of 
people who can and do do just that and more...I know of 3rd level monks 
with more hp than me... :)

But I hold my own comfortably when in a group. And I like it like that.
