   Are you useing a Dial up When I first started playing EQ 2 years ago
I  was working all over and useing dial up and had allmost the same
problem

started out log in all was fine the longer I would play the more lag I
would get till EQ would kick me off and the dail up would not work even
loged if still loged in. I would have to restart and it would happen all
over again.

When luclen came out I would be link die as soom as I logged in.

After 2 weeks of this found the problem was the modem NOTE: Win Modems
are softwear modems and need to use your free mem to work. EQ leaves NO
FREE MEM if you have a win modem/softwear modem EQ uses up the modem
mem. So EQ forces your modem to turn over all the mem it is useing and
the modem shuts down there by shutting down EQ.

    Sorry about spelling and grammer I know i am hard to read and i hope
this is helpful
