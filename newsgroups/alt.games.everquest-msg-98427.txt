Celestial Heal/Elixir are considered buffs, and not heals, so they do not
benefit from the clerical healing bonus (or Healing Adept AA). They DO
benefit from the spell casting reinforcement AA ability, increasing how
long they heal for.

This is true of all HoT and DoT spells...because of the way the 6 second
pulses work, about half the time you will get a bonus tick of
healing/damage. If you think this is nice for Celestial Healing, think of
how nice it is for Torpor....60 shamans with this spell make ungodly
powerful healers.

What I will love is (although there are some big IFs attached, like the
fact that Torpor is insanely rare, and I don't have it) Torpor + max spell
reinforcement + spell reinforcement mastery + max quickbuf + max spell
casting mastery....3 second cast time, 1800 points of healing over 36
seconds for 200 mana, with the very large possibility of a successful
specialization check, thus reducing the mana cost to 100. The snare is
irrelevant, but the attack speed loss is a bit of a nuisance...still, that
is HUGE healing.
