It's still CONSIDERABLY more than the other 6 groups on the raid, who
get nothing.

Pre-raid-exp:

A custom made KS group on a 10 hour VT raid get around 2aa points or so
per person. The warriors come out with negative exp, in part due to the
fact that healers are having to heal overagroing nukers and meleers
chasing the kill. Enchanters come out with negative exp, due to messes
being broken as people try to get exp from unengaged mobs. Encs and
shaman have to go without groups because they don't fit into the KS
group format.

Post-raid-exp:

People watch agro much much more. Adds are left messed. 5 rog/rng can
group with a bard for the extra songs. Enchanters, Shaman and warriors
get the full attention of the healers. Every last person on a VT raid
will usually come out with at least simlar exp to when they went in.

Raid exp is a 'Good Thing' <tm>

They could ramp it up a little more and it would be a 'Better Thing'
<tm> without being overpowering
