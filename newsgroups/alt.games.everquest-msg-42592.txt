Horses will reach faster speeds than SoW

Bah, wanted to find the link to where I read that, could've sworn it was
on caster's realm, but can't find it now

Did find this:

(qoute)
Jeff Butler: Effectively, like the spirit of wolf spell works now. They
will increase the PC speed as they run through the world. Combat, such
as it exists right now will not be changed while on horseback. So
players will still be able to cast spells, they'll be able to fight.
Horses will function kind of as a prestige item for players, and also as
increased transportation speed. 

Brad McQuaid: Think of them as an alternative to traveler's boots, or
journeyman's boots. They'll be purchasable, they'll look different
depending on the type of horse you buy and what race you are. Their
speed will vary; obviously the faster the horse you buy, the more it
will cost.

15k =/= prestige to me (:O/
