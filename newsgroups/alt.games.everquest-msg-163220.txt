Well, I'm not the sort to defend repulicans, and yet, when you post
"Next you'll be telling me that thieves are just doing their part..."
it sure as hell looks to me like you are approaching accusing him of
defending thievery.  You are certainly, given the context, trying to
create an equivalency in the reader's mind between what was said by
the other poster and what you said.  The "equally absurd" BS you posted
in response to Gary's reply to you is pretty weak given the context,
as well you must know give the knowledge and skill at argument you have
shown in many other threads.  The choice of what to compare to Gary's
words was yours, denying that it represents a deliberate attempt to
smear him by encouraging readers to infer that he is "defending
thievery" is BS and you know it.  Next you're gonna tell us that
the thinly veiled smear campaigns pursued via "issue" ads are not
about the elections they precede.
