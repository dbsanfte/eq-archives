Just recentally with the new Dx9 patch, my eqclient seems to crash every
time i get actually in the game on my charactor. Its not any particular zone
it just crashes and says to send the info back to sony any o you other guys
had this problem? Ive tried to delet eqclient and let testeverquest
redownload it, but it didnt work it just made the crashing come sooner. All
i can think of that is happening at the moment is that my graphics card
technically only supports Dx7. So i was thinking maybe i should get a new
video card, but it'll be a while before i can scrounge up the money. Anyone
have any thoughts as to howi can get eq to work without buying a video card
for now?
