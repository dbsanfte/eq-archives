Well - I have about zero tolerance for alcohol, so instead of drinking half
a carton of heavies (around 5%) a day which I did about 6 years ago I now
have about 2 light beers (2.2%) a day during the week.

On weekends I don't take the Diazepam (Valium) as I drink pretty solidly.
Well, for me that is, a carton of 24 light beers will last a whole weekend
which keeps me pretty merry the whole weekend. That's a dozen light beers
over about 8-12 hour stint so it would be nothing for most people...

It was proberly heavy drinking that first brought out my genetic
predisposition to depression in the first place. In my RAAF days (1990-1996)
in a culture of heavy drinkers I was known as one of the heaviest. We would
consume a carton (24) heavies each and then consider heading out on the town
to keep the cost down.

Weekends were drinking from sunup to sundown. I would not exactly say it was
a <complete> waste of 6 years of my life because some of the things that
happened to me during that time were undeniably hilarious*. I would say it
was when my sense of humour was burned into me and my hide thickened to it's
present state.

But, I danced my jig now I am paying the band...

I would hate to know what hard drugs do to a persons brain, especially those
with genetic predispositions to mental illness as well. Alcohol was the only
thing I ever touched and it only took 6 years to tip the balance.

*I might recite a few of these later on, but I would run the risk of being
called a complete and utter bullshitter.
