Pah! Every once in a while I see someone advertise one of the two likely 
port channels on my server...  But when I need a port...

/join port
/join taxi:taxi
/list
port(1), taxi(1)
...
/leaveall

I think he means the auction channel (bazaar on my server) and not 
/auction.  The reason not to being, you are -so- not going to deliver, are 
you?  It's annoying, really, because on one of those big raids where you 
end up spending two hours waiting for everyone to get their shit together 
would be the optimum time for reading a high-volume channel like bazaar.
