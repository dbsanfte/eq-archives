> If you get a bard, you'll need a tank... monk is not a tank... just ask
one.

Hi I'm a monk, I can tank pretty much anything in Sebilis (only thing I
haven't tanked is Trak) I have tanked twice in the monk epic final battle (2
mobs each time, 1 very red), and I have tanked Temple of Veeshan mobs
(obviously it took a cheal rotation team, but the 60 warriors with defensive
had the exact same cheal rotation group)

I've broke PoF with just 1 other 60 monk, I've even tanked the AoW (for
about 10 seconds) :)

And my gear is anything but "uber"
