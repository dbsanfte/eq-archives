Yeah I play on Veeshan and they are every bit as bad as their rep. The two
most recent incidents of note were at Trakanon and Ragefire.
At Trakanon, my guild and another were buffing at the bridge, having killed
the Protector and with a monk feigned in the lair. Xanupox led a CT force
straight past these people and KSed Trakanon. He claimed he was in his right
to do this because someone had told him 3 hours previously that Trak wasn't
up, and thus nobody was heading to the lair. He also claimed after speaking
to one of the two guilds on the raid that they didn't have enough to kill
Trak, as they only had 16 in zone, completely ignoring the fact that another
guild had a similar number there. Which of course he knew because the CT
raid had to run past the 30+ people doing their final buffs. To top THAT
off, after getting nailed on the above points (ie if you pull the Lair, Trak
is yours. Anything else is a KS) he claimed it _wasn't_ a KS because we
'hadn't engaged the mob'. As though rules designed to settle derv-camp
squabbles apply to Trakanon...
Ragefire was similar. Another Veeshan guild had camped Ragefire for 2-3
days. He popped and they were bringing another group or 2 into the lair for
the kill. Xanupox (note the theme?) led a group into the lair and simply
told a CT cleric to turn in the pearl, pretty much ignoring the other guild.

Now Veeshan has a history of being pretty hardcore. No calendars, little
co-operation, first-in-force claims the mob/zone/whatever. This has pretty
much been boiled down to 2-3 good groups in place and the rest incoming
fast, in order to make a claim that most people will respect. Except CT of
course. They are the biggest guild in terms of sheer numbers on Veeshan.
They have in INCREDIBLE inferiority complex regarding their laughable
"rivalry" with Fires of Heaven. They are renowned for containing huge
numbers of inept players (CT it is said stands for Constant Trains or
Clueless Twats instead of Celestial Tomb). They are more renowned for
crowing about their great prowess in game yet their only tactic is the zerg
rush ie. They recently bragged of downing Hoshkar in 10 seconds. With 60
people including about 12 Wizards. They regularly use 60+ to fight Cazic
Thule and similar mobs.

It's hard to think of a guild with a lower reputation. Problem is they are
so large and have such a bunker-mentality I can't see the problem going away
as long as their leaders are such assholes. A lot of guilds operate a
no-cooperation policy towards CT. Some have gone as far as to actively
harass them which, while obviously a bit naughty, has been hilarious. Such
as the feigned monk handing a Glowing Black Sword (procs dispel on
_wielder_) and a Velium Swiftblade (50% haste) to Cazic Thule shortly before
CT were to fight him (referred to as the SuperMechaCazic incident).

So there you go. I love to start the day with a rant :)
