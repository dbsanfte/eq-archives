I leveled up fast, and I did it largely solo tanking, or in groups speed 
killing high level mobs.   They didn't need anything mezzed and neither 
did I, most of the time.

I also missed most spells from 63-70, hard to get, with people not 
exping in zones where those runes drop, and since I knew I could buy the 
spells from 71 up, I just didn't go out of my way to get them.

This means I hit the 70s and found that I couldn't actually cast some of 
my spells.

Oh, Alteration was maxed out at 316, spec alt maxed too, in fact all 
specializations maxed, its not like I never cast at all.

But my other casting skills were down in around 150 or so.

That was fine, I could cast most of my spells... which were, after all, 
in the 55-62 range anyway.

But then I got a Mez which would actually land on mobs we were fighting, 
instead of the ones I've had up till now that would only land on LB mobs 
anyway so why bother.

Couldn't cast it.

Its not alteration, its Conjuration!

Couldn't find any spells at all that were conjuration that I could chain 
cast for skillups either.

Summon Pet, which costs tiny daggers and which requires that I kill the 
pet each time, a pain, plus long cast and cycle time anyway.  And Mez, 
which requires a live target.

Oh well, I went to SRo, made a hotkey to cast five times in a row, and 
set about chain mezzing a dune tarantula or anything else nearby, while 
watching TV. When I forgot to hit the button, and mez would break, the 
mob would attack me and my pet would kill it, so I'd have to find 
another, but no danger at all.   In two hours, I got 50 skillups.   /cry

Then someone gave me a suggestion I hadn't heard before.

I have the Summon Supply Agent AA.   If you have a pet or familiar up, 
this fails, I knew that.  What I hadn't paid attention to was the fact 
that you can potentially get a skillup when doing so... and that on fail 
the thing resets instantly, instead of 12 hours later.

With a pet or familiar up, you can chain click that fast as your fingers 
will fly.    Within 15 minutes I'd done the remaining 100 or so skillups 
and capped conjuration for my level.

As fortune would have it, I went on a mini raid that very night to 
Theatre of Blood, where I was the only enchanter, and I was able to keep 
  adds pinned down only because I had managed to cap the skill out. 
Three hours before the raid I'd have been useless with a 150 skill!

*** postscript tried to cast my AE mez, guess what, its Abjuration 
based.  Oh no, where's my fast solution to this one?
