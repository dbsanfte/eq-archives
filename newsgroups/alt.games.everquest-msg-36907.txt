I recently got one of these things from kael.

Thunder Runed War Spear - Primary or Range
Damage: 13
Delay: 33
AC: +5 Magic Resist: +5 HP: +25
Weight: 9.0

Seeing as this dosnt have a "Range distance" like most range equippable
items for throwing, would I be safe to swop this around with my Bow and NOT
be able to throw it during combat by mistake?.
