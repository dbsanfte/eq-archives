Today in the office I made a good recovery (nobody else plays EQ so I got
away with it), a guy picked up a pastry from the tray and went to pick
another (don't know who for) and I said "Can't do that, they're lore". He
looked at me like I had gone mad so I did my best and said instantly "Can't
do that... it's the law", smiled weakly and left with great speed :o)
