It has always (or at least since July of '99) been true that chatting
while moving/turning leaves you moving/turning unless you break it by
hitting another movement key.  Easy test:  while holding down the key
for left or right turn hit <enter> twice, then let up the key, you
will continue spinning.  I use this with forward+turn to get my char
swimming in a circle for skill-ups while I read.

This is new, and I have noticed it a couple of times also, seems to
only occur if I run for a while (happens going backwards too).

The other new "feature" I've noticed is that you have to reverse
direction (forward/backward) to break the "chat" autorun now, it
used to be sufficient to tap the forward key.
