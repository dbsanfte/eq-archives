I just fucking love it when my lame ass news server completely fails to
pick up *any* messages in a thread until it decides to grab the one
where whatever useful information forthcoming has already been posted,
and there's just a "Thanks Guys."

By the way, Biz.... that's not a rip at you.  Supernews just has too
many frigging days where it pulls this crap. I'll see one or  a bunch of
responses, and never see the original post or answers.
Grrrrrrrrrrrr
