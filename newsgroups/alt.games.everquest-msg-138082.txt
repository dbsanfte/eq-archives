Your refusal to accept the opportunity in no way negates the
potential....silly.

No, I am saying that because you can't cast fireballs you exist in
reality as opposed to your character who could potentially cast
fireballs since he lives in a fictional fantasy world.  Of course based 
on your posts  one could make an argument that you also live in such a
world.

No, I am not able to drive my car through Freeport if you are referring
to the fictional city in the fantasy game called Everquest.  That tells
me that my car belongs to me in reality and since it doesn't even  exist
in Everquest Sony/VI have no claim to it.  I may sell it if I choose in
the real world.  Don't get your hopes  up though, that baby is a classic
and I ain't letting her go till either her or I am dead.

You say that almost as if you believe it.  That  unfortunately means
that rather than being intentionally obtuse you are merely clueless. 
How sad for you.

I just don't know what to make of your comments here.  I mean you could
just be trying to pretend for the sake of argument or you could really
be this silly.  Normally I would take the opportunity to make fun of you
but at the moment that just seems wrong, like picking on the handicapped
or something.

I think you misunderstood.  I said I would grovel if you could cast
fireballs.  You can't, I'm not, piss off <G>.
