Depends on what kinda magic you like doing, and how much meleeing you 
like doing.

There's the priests and pure casters:
Clerics are always healing people and bitching about monks pulling mobs 
across 'em (/wave Monual).

Wizards get the big nukes and bitch that they're not big enough (/wave 
Uber).

Mages get to have pets and some nice nukes and bitch that they can't 
outdamage the rangers, rogues and wizards.

Enchanters get to control minds and bitch that they can't control 'em 
long enough.

Necromancers thrive on death (including their own).  One of the best solo 
classes (druid, wizard and mage are also up there).  They generally don't 
bitch a whole lot.

Druids are a jack of all trades, master of none.  Nukes aren't as good as 
a wizard's, damage shields are as good as a mage, snares aren't as good 
as a necro, heals aren't as good as a cleric.  But they do have some form 
of all of the above and they're not *that* far into second in some cases.  
One of the easiest classes to play.  They bitch about not being the best 
at anything.

Shaman eat themselves a lot.  Best physical/melee buffs in the game and 
some of the best debuffs/slows.  Also the #3 healer in the game (though 
it's a pretty distant 3rd).  They bitch about a lack of condiments being 
readily available when they need to chow down.

Then there's the hybrids:
Bards are a cross between warrior and enchanter.  Very short duration 
spells, but a good bard is a godsend.  Your wrists will hate you.  Not a 
whole lot of bitching here, you have to be somewhat of a masochist to 
play a bard anyway.

Paladins are a cross between warrior and cleric.  Great tanks for XP 
groups, but you'll take a back seat to the warriors during raids.  Lots 
of nice heals to get a group out of a tight spot, but don't expect to be 
the main healer any time soon.  They bitch that they can't tank as well 
as warriors.

Shadowknights are a cross between warrior and necromancer.  Easy to solo, 
equally nice tank for XP groups, and some very nice group taps later on.  
Mainly just laugh as the raid wipes and they're feigning death.

Rangers are a cross between druids and rogues from what I can tell.  
Pretty much a jack of all trades, master of none until the (much) later 
levels when we become masters of pulling and damage.  We bitch about 
archery not doing enough damage until we have our levels and AA points 
and then we shut up and laugh at everybody else.

Beastlords are a cross between monks and shaman.  Fun class, easy to 
solo.  Get nice pets and do some pretty mean damage.  Also get some nice 
buffs.  Not a whole lot of bitching going on here.
