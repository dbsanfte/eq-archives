So, by that reasoning, none of the starter cities have a book either, 
except possibly Kelethin which is in Gfay.  The book in GD is the Thurgadin 
book, and is so labelled in PoK.  Much like all the other books, it is 
tucked away in a relatively safe spot, so that all can use it with little 
fear of faction issues.
