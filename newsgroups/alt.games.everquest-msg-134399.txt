 Yeah me too. I forsee the rapid decline of prices on items very, very
soon. People will make a mule, gate him up to The Bazaar, buy the satchels,
load the items they want to sell and then go shopping around looking at 
the prices others are putting on same or similar items then set a price
a little lower to liquidate.
 
 I for one plan to do that with the several dozen items I never have the
time to sell in NFP or on the market channel.
