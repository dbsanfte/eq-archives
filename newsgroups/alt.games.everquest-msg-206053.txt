Hiya,

you did the right thing : let him die =) Or ask him to consent you and drag
his corpse a bit further in ...

For the wanted ports : you could send him a tell after a few minutes and ask
him if his stupid as. still is looking for someone to port him out ... maybe
they ll recognize when people pass them laughing about their "rudeness" lol

I even was petitioned because I havent given 5k to a level 1 warrior that
begged me for this sum... but the gm laughed too about this stupidity
(o-tone : i want this bp... give me the money)

After school will start again many of this people will leave again... I
think several of them test the trialperiod, supported by their friends and
want to be uber from the very first hour ( ok, who wouldnt grin)... time
will come and the game will be again what it used to be

Have fun in game

Christian
