My favorite has always been that you can't wear a
wrist pouch on your wrist!

Why does a gem take up the same space as a breastplate
or a 2 handed sword?

Why can a Kodiak bear walk through walls?

Why is it with all these mages, wizards, and powerful
spell casters with all these High intelligence's and
magic powers No one has made a friggin' map spell?
