How could someone who's played since beta have forgotten that the forums
where all the action took place for the first year+ were wiped I wonder.
I played late beta (demo more like, never even got access to the beta
forums to report bugs) and early release, and the nerfs from Mythic
actually drove me back to EQ too.

From the first experience nerf, which they continued to insist was a bug
fix even after people posted logs showing that adding someone outside of
about +/- 2 levels of each other actually dropped experience on the
floor rather than sharing it, to the class nerfs and indirect class
nerfs they'd make when nerfing one class would also nerf a class that
wasn't even on their radar because they shared a weapon style.

I started out with a Warden, which in Mythic's original description was
a priest class who was also a formidable fighter. In his late 20's I
found he was actually outdamaged in melee by the Druid, who got no
weapon specialization at all, due to the druid's damage add and the weak
damage table of the Warden. Then I tried the Champion, which looked like
an interesting class with their spells and melee. After getting to the
mid 20's it became increasingly obvious that the only noticable effect
was their snare spell, the slows and other debuffs made so little
difference to a mob's damage output as to not be worth casting. Dispite
this being brought to their attention repeatedly by the team leader for
the class, they then nerfed the spells even more to counteract some bug
that made the spells ten times more powerful in pvp.

Having a bit more time on my prepaid account I moved to Midguard and
tried a Warrior. That was the final straw, when I discovered that the
melee system was so poorly designed that reactionary styles were
impossible with some weapons they'd given the class, as if the weapon
delay was slower than the mob's swing speed, it was utterly impossible
to use a style based on a parry or other reaction because the mob would
have swung again by the time your reaction style hit the mob and the
game counted when it hit to determine if it was valid.

After I quit I happened to see a post from Sanya replying to people
bringing up issues like this that basically said, if you don't like it,
don't play the game, which ended any thought of going back once they'd
got around to fixing such fundamental problems, so I haven't really
looked at the game since.
