I had excactly the same race, level, class and god when I decided to do the
same and had the same problem. After killing many kobolds I've rasied my
faction a little in both paineel (where I'm no longer KOS but they still
wont talk to me) and erudin, but basically I think you've just got stick
at it a great deal longer. I'm told killing the king and other high levels
give much more faction, but I've not done it my self. You should be able
to solo them with a bit of dificulty at level 30.

Now with luclin of course the nearest place to buy & sell is the bazaar
which
you can reach from the spires just next to paineel.
