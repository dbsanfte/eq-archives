i have 2 accounts and a character of each class. Of all of them i
still think that mez/mem blur is the handiest thing in the game. im
still suprised how many people are totally dumbfounded when we get an
add we dont intend to do combat with and people still feel the need to
zone or gate to clear aggro. thats even at 65. (twinking,
powerleveling and guilds make for a lot of 65th level noobies) Got an
add? Let pet attack, step back, mezz, mem blur then go on your merry
way. If you got a non mezzable monster then root and mem blur.
