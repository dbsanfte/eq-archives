Hehe, im pretty sure it must have been a mistake if hes been kiting 8. 
Optimal number are 4, since our AEs cant hit any more. You CAN hit more 
if you use the PB AEs, but theres no way im gonna let 4+ hasted mobs in 
meelee range :)

You could have aggo on 3 mobs at a time, were changed to unlimited some 
patches ago, this making it easier for quadders (no need to get the 4th 
rounded up again after one of them hit you), and more or less killing AE 
groups.
