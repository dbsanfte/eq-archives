 That's how I do it. Unofortuantely you can't hotkey a bag slot so
you'll need to move the item into a General box. From there hotkey that
box along with your waepon slot. When you want to switch you just need
to do a quick click, move, click, move, click to switch the two. It only
takes a second. I would recommend turning on the drop notification
though. That thing has stopped me from dropping a few expensive items.
