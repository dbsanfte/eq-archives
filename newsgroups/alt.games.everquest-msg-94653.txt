Just so you know... There are, by large, jerks in every class of about the
same level.  Hell, I ran across one dipstick Cleric who Atoned a kite of
mine, stating he didn't know I was kiting it, never mind the fact I ran by
him 3 times with a huge sand giant chasing my ass with half its hitpoints
down.

His claim to fame: "I atone everything before I kill it."

There are also mages who run their SG pets in Oasis, which is funny at a
time, but after a while, it gets annoying, especially people who kite crap
to places on purpose.

Druids don't necessarily have the market in jerks.  However the poster is
correct that, by in large, people harass druids for SoWs, Ports or Wolf
Form.  Much like caster type classes harass Enchanters for their crack, or
Clerics for rezzes.  When Druids, Clerics, Enchanters or Wizards go
hunting, we switch, for the most part to Anon or role play.  Why?  To avoid
being bothered while hunting or busy in a group or something.

I don't feel ashamed to charge people to port them somewhere, cause it is
time I would be using to try and get the money the old fashion way,
smacking mobs, or working on the pissy tradeskills.  It is also one of the
sole means we can make money if we don't do it the old fashion way.  When I
play my alts...  I rarely ask for a port or SoW, let alone as my druid do I
bother a person for crack unless they offer it.  And if I do ask, it would
be from a Guild member, only then, if they have the time and willing to do
it.  If not, I tell them no problems.

I don't charge guild members ports, but I also sometimes turn down porting
or turn down people paying for a port for the sole reason I am at a
location is that I want to do something there, such as building up XP.
Money is great, but doesn't mean much either if you don't have that next
level where you can do other things or get that extra mana from the high
wisdom you built up.
