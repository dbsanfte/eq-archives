Lizard Blood Potion -- instant cast of "Cazic-Thule Gate" (it
teleports you to the top of the Wizard portal in Cazic-Thule),
one charge.

I *always* keep one of these on me as an insurance policy.
If things are really going to hell in a spot where CR is
going to be messy, just click your heels together three
times and say, "there's no place like Cazic-Thule, there's no..."

Since it's instant-cast, it gets you out of trouble even
when everything in the dungeon is beating on you, it 
can't be interrupted.  I used one just yesterday when 
I was swarmed in the deepest part of the Temple of 
Droga (Chief room). 

Just make sure that being in the middle of a bunch of
cranky lizards isn't worse than where you're escaping out of.
But even so, CR in CT is probably a lot better than wherever
you just came from.
