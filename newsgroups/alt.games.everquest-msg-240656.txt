OK, thanks to everyone on this board for the info, and especially Wolfbones
for in-game help I have my PAL-Frog back again.  Now I have a few other
questions.

I learned without a weapon I had a hard time killing anything. (trying to
farm rats in Freeport so I could buy food and water)  With my lvl 10PAL
how do I build this up?  I know fighting "greens" won't do it and fighting
"blues" takes almost  minutes to kill a Puma, Skell, etc.
(I know I can buy this training  at a time when I level, but I am looking
for something right now)

I have learned to keep food, water, weapons, etc in the bank now so I can
get to something when I am dead.

Thanks again for all the help and for your help with this ...Ben
