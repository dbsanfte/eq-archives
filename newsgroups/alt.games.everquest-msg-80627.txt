As a newbie I would say that if I had this alternative I would prabably take
advantage of it.  The only thing I hate about it is when I see a really
twinked out char and assume that he/she can kick ass and guess what?  Is a
good lesson about judging a book by it's cover.

There are those who insist on doing things on thier own for all of their
characters.  My hats off to them.  Last night I played with a 5th level
druid who's alt was lvl 35.  He was still bashing things with a splintering
club.  We were killing orcs and he wasn't even taking belts (worth 1pp each
in Kelethin) because he had no backpack to store them in.  Since he had no
way to store the belts, I sold them and gave him his share of the money.  At
least now he can buy a backpack and a rusty mace!

He thanked me for being honest, I admired him for being determined!
