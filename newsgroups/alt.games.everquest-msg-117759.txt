I have read the same on different boards and I'm currently attacking this
problem, if anyone of you hackers can give me a hint then please do:

PROBLEM:
I installed Everquest as Administrator, then used the CACLS command to give
a particular user full rights to c:\program\everquest and all
sub-directorys.

I checked that the user can indeed create and edit stuff.

Still, just after giving user name and password, I am thrown to desktop.

This is not good since having to play online games as an administrator makes
my security so much worse ...

LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER:

I tried to find info on this but the only thing I have seen is others have
experienced the same thing

In an answer (in the last link above) an indication that I have to install
Everquest as a USER :
(but it doesn't say anything about why USER don't work when I give him
rights to the sub-directory)

----->

While trying to play EQ on WinXP, You may come across some issues patching
through the patch server, or logging in, when logged into windows as a USER.
This means that the permissions of Admin aren't applied to the user account,
and while patching you'll receive an error that ACCESS IS DENIED. The reason
why this occurs, is that you aren't holding ADMIN PERMISSIONS, and you won't
be able to write over files, that an ADMIN has ran. For example if a person
who has admin permissions had installed EQ. The user account can't run the
patch, because the patch overwrites files, and USER PERMISSIONS can't
overwrite those files, giving you the associated error message, ACCESS
DENIED.

The way around this problem would be by INSTALLING EVERQUEST as USER. That
way everyone has persmissions, because the ADMIN permissions exceed user
permission, so in this case EVERYONE will have rights. Therefore all users
can play the game.

So in short. Install EQ as a plain user. Not as an ADMIN. If you install as
an ADMIN, make sure that you LOG into WinXP as an ADMIN in order to play EQ.
Thank you."

There was also an indication of low virtual memory when I log on as the user

Maybe I should try unchecking all new models or changing that setting
