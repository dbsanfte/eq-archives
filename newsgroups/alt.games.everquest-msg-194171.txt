Every guild has its own character, and it's own rules.  But every one
that I know of at least encourages grouping with fellow guildmates,
whether this is on raids, or just casual grouping.

My suggestion is that if he's having problems, that he just quit the
guild, and try to find another one. The best way to do this is to
group with people from other guilds, or even better, attend open raids
that other guilds sponsor.  A few times, I've even found myself in a
zone where another guild was raiding, and politely asked if I could
join them.  Depending on the guilds' rules, I may not be eligible for
any loot, etc, but at least it will give your BF an opportunity to
meet people from the other guilds in a raid situation to see how they
operate, and can ask questiions about the guild, get their webste URL,
etc.

 I'm sure there is a guild on his server that is more to his liking.
The guild I'm in right now has the right mixture of casualness, and
raiding that suits me just fine.  Just about everyone understands that
we have personal lives, and in-game friends that are not in our guild
that we like to play with, so no one ever has given me grief for
avoiding a raid because, for example, my RL friends are on-line, and I
so rarely get to group with them, or because I want to do something
other than play EQ.  Then again, those that DO participate more in
raids, DO get rewarded for their efforts.
