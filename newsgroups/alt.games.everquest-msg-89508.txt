After tonight, it's up to 75ish.

And ID is at 45!

That said, I found my spot for a while- the Aviak Village in SK. the mobs 
are non-inherently aggro, although they are social... This means I can 
practice my FD pulling here (which I have been all night). The egrets are 
easy, the darters are harder but still doable, and the rooks, avocets, and 
others are still beyond my reach. I have the added bonus of getting to work 
on my Safe Fall skill... The best of all worlds!

Najena is on the list for a few levels from now, followed by Unrest... Then 
I believe I will hit Karnors, Crystal Caverns, and the like.

Tonight, one of my guildmates offered me a loaner FRSS and fighting 
baton... Woot! I will be a damage MACHINE!

Thanks all for your input... soloing a melee is actually fun!
