There's a really really outdated version of my site up at
http://216.122.106.127/

Its a sad thing really, I wrote it back in 1995 or so, didn't maintain 
it much in the next couple years, and eventually gave up on it, 
concluding that I'm just not a web site kind of person.  Numerous times 
over the past decade people have claimed they would happily set me up 
with a "real" site, some for money, some in exchange for a sword, some 
just as a project.  Its never come to anything.

What you're looking at there is a very faintly rewritten version of the 
original by the latest in that long series of people... I've sent him a 
couple emails about what sort of things I'd suggest doing to it, but no 
response in the past week or two, I'm guessing its another dead end.
