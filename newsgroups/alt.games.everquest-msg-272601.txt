I like hailing them so the group knows what I am going to pull next.

You can also make/edit a macro key with the /assist on it and add it to your
hotbar.
It makes it alot faster when you have a group of mobs and you have spells
going off like crazy everywhere.
Also nice in that you can make sure it isn't you who awakens the mezzed mob,
and you can change the /assist person by right clicking and editing the name
straight from the hotbar too.
