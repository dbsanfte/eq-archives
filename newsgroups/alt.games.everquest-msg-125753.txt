Sometimes this happens on some systems. A friend of mine with a very low end
computer often spends his time "playing the amrket" in the EC tunnel on our
server. One day, he saw an uction that said "<insert decent Item here>
<stats> 1 K" With a space between the 1 and the K. He says he'll but, and
puts 1000pp into the trade window. The seller then says that he wanted 1.5K.
On some systems, that .5 can get cut off, as it did with my friend. I
suspect that this was either the same bug or a related one.
