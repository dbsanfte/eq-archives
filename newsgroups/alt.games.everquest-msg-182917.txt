It is because level 16 is not that high of a level.  You are still a pretty
young character.  As your level increases, the toll that death has on you
will become even greater.  That is why Clerics are absolutely needed in the
higher levels for their resurrection skills.  If you died at level 50 and
did not get a rez from a Cleric you could be looking at a week or so of
playing just to get that level back.

I always thought that death was too easy in the game.  I think what would
have been neat is that when you die, your soul would go to another plane and
you would have to perform some task before you would be granted the ability
to come back to the mortal world.  And this would vary depending on your
level.  The higher the level, the harder the task.  If you failed at the
task given to you, your character would be sent back to the natural world to
the zone where you died, however you would lose a percentage of your gold
and experience but you would have your equipment.  No more corpse runs.  If
you succeeded in the task assigned then you would be brought back to your
starting city but would suffer no exp or gold penalty.

To make things even more interesting, Clerics and Necromancers would gain a
teleport spell that would allow them to travel to this plane.  On a limited
basis, they could assist the departed in completing their task.  If the
Cleric was high enough, then he or she could go ahead and Rez the departed
character and avoid the whole "completing a task" thing.  Also, if
characters did not want to go through the hassle of even bothering with
trying to do the task then they could visit a NPC or one of many NPCs and
request to be sent back immediately.

Another possible solution to the whole death problem is that you lose 10
points of Stamina each time you die and it would take a cleric of at least
level 30 to heal you of this loss.  If you died again, before the cleric
restored your Stamina then you lose another 10 points and then you would
need a cleric of at least level 50 heal you.  Clerics level 30-49 could only
restore 10 points of stamina after a death.  So if your stamina was 50
points in the hole and you finally decide to get the lesser restore, the
most you could be healed for would be 10 points.  You would have to find a
cleric level 50 or above to heal the rest.  If this system was used then
corpse recovery would remain the same except for the following.  If the zone
is patrolled by guards, any guards of a decent intelligence, and you fail to
recover your corpse during the first 24 hours after death, the guards in the
zone will discover your corpse and take it to their headquarters.
Essentially, your corpse will be placed in the morgue.  If you were a good
race and you died in a zone patrolled by guards of an evil race, then you
best hope you get your corpse within this 24 hour window.  If not, then you
will have to find a way of retrieving your body and items from the area's
morgue.

I am not saying the above are perfect.  But I know game designers for SONY
sometimes browse these newsgroups.  Yes, death should be a pain.  But,
endless corpse recovering runs do not have to be the only solution to
handling death.
