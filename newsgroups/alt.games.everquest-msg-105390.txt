It's a single extra keystroke once you get the hotkey set up.  Take
one of your social keys, label it Assist, and type on the first line:

/assist %t

Now move it to your hotkey bank.  

Now, every time you come across a mob that you have any question
about, when you target the mob (which you have to do anyway to attack
it), hit your Assist key.  If the mob is aggro'd on anyone they will
become your active target.
