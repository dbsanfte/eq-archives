I don't know exactly what I said initially to draw such ire from you to 
begin with, but like I said, it was clear enough the situation to which I 
was referring. Why don't *you* take your *own* advice and STFU. Better 
yet, think twice, nay, maybe even three times before you slap down more 
of that abrasive, argumentative crap you try to pawn off as 
conversational contribution.

I had a caster in my group that twice panicked and ran around while a mob 
beat her to death, causing delays for CR. Don't tell me my complaints 
aren't valid. You seem to find pleasure in taking what is said and 
applying it to any possible scenario where it might prove false or 
inapplicable. Lop my head off all you want. You won't wind up looking any 
taller for it.

There was no "ulterior motive" to my snipping of whatever it was I 
snipped beyond the interest of brevity. By the way, if you don't have SoW 
and you're running "in tight circles" from a mob, you better be wearing 
plate at the very least.
