I just bought a horse 3 days ago, after getting tired of being the only 
caster to be whacked on in Fear, because i were sitting down.
And after 2 days of owning one, i can only say: GET A HORSE.
True, its a little uglier if you got all models off (had around 50% of 
them off already, so not a big loss), but that by FAR outweigth the 
ability to not see your horse (that head is ANNOYING), and being able to 
use SoE while being on my horse.
Made my soloing a LOT easier, cant wait to try it on a guild raid.
