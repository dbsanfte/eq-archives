Well, in some of the cases I have heard about hacked accounts, this being in
the chat room most of the time, players are wigging out cause they can't get
into the game, meanwhile, the hacker is popping onto a server with the
hacked account, making a character to transfer your possessions via another
account.

Another fun thing I have been hearing is players who scam other players with
stuff.

If you think this is bad, I have a coworker who sees, on a regular basis,
attempts to get people to give their username and password on Diablo II.  It
is a sad, sad world.
