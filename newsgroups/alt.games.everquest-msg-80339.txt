60 hours for 8 points (mental clarity 1) means 90 hours for 12 points
(mental clarity 3)
Even if it only saves me 60 of 90 hours, it will be a *net* cost of 30 hours
for mc3... not bad really.
Im not sure if its worth it or not, but I dont think the answer is clear
cut.
Im going for it anyway, and Im at lvl 56. As a druid spending most of my
time medding (soloing) it should suit me.
