Any guild that would allow the admittance of someone with that name isn't
worth being a part of.

Any guild that would /guildremove someone for petitioning a name like that
isn't worth being a part of.

The only reason they wanted you back is because they saw a landslide of
their members leaving because those other members agree with you and like
you better.

Getting married in-game to someone who would /guildremove her fiance at the
drop of a hat is a move I would question.
