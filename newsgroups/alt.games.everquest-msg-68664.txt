System: 900 MHz Athlon (a bit over a year old, so it's one of the
older versions), 768 meg RAM, GeForce 2 GTS 64 MB with latest drivers,
Windows XP.

EQ Settings: 1024x768, medium textures, all new models enabled.

Misty Thicket, with my Barbarian: ranged from 35 to 45 frames/second,
depending on where I was.  No framerate change when turning around.

Rivervale, with my Barbarian: ranged from 10 to 30 frames/second.  Was
about 16 standing in the bank looking at the door.  Dropped to 10
pretty much anywhere when I'd turn.

Sharvahl, with my kitty: ranged from 10 to about 25 frames/second.

If other people want to try this, go to www.fraps.com to get a program
to show you your FPS in most DirectX games.  It works, I believe, by
hooking DirectX so it can count the calls by the game to flip surfaces
(most games use two drawing surfaces...one to display, and one to
render the next frame on, and then they tell DirectX to swap the two),
and then it puts a small overlay on showing your FPS.
