I think most of the content for lower character is still there,
including MORE in most cases. When I was levelling up, from L40 to L50
(the cap) I had a choice of ONE zone to level in: LGuk. The only other
zone for reasonable post-40 grouping was SolB, out of bounds to me
unless I brought a private shaman.

A lot of the new content is directed at high levellers, because they
have actually done the lower content already. Very little has been taken
out, and a lot has been added, even for low and mid levels. The game
changes for you every time you gain a few levels and move on to new
pastures, at L60, there are no new level, therefore new pastures have to
be created in an effort to keep the game moving.


I think you need to realise that a horse is an upperclass toy, not a
basic living requirement.

A 10 yearold doing chores for pocket money
A 15 yearold working weekends at the store
A 20 yearold starting at the bottom in a large corporate
A 25 yearold with a few promotions
A 30 yearold middle management
A 40 yearold member of the board
A 50 yearold CEO

Which of the above have a car? 
Have a nice expensive car? 
Have a private Jet?
Should everyone be given a private jet on their 20th Birthday?
