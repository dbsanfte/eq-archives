Yeah.  The problem with a steel-trap mind like mine is that
you're so worried about getting the datum out quick before
it snaps shut again that sometimes the wrong thing pops out.

What made it obvious (to me anyway) wasn't so much the dragon
loot though, it was the LGuk loot that had been being auctioned
trade-only and was suddenly being offerred for cash or trade,
or even for pp only sometimes.
