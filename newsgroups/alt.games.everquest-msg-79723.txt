Yes Dan, it is worth it, for me anyway.

One place EQ and DAoC are similar is things can get rough when you hit your
teens. In DAoC you level like mad to level 10, then level easily to 15, then
things start slowing down. You have graduated from the newbie zones, and
the mobs are out there a bit. It is also when you start to really learn how
to play the game, and that is where the difference between playing EQ and
playing DAoC. If you play DAoC like you played EQ, things are really going
to slow down and get tedious.

I am not sure what you mean by one thing, at this point I intentionally RvR
about once or twice a week, (I hunt in the frontier quite a bit and sometimes
RvR finds me, :-), the rest of the time I am hunting named mobs for loot, 
doing quests, hitting the dungeons, and hanging out with friends.

I played EQ for 2.5 years and that is similar to my EQ experience.

: That's not enough for me.

I guess it come down to that, its entertainment and if you are not entertained
what is the point.

For me there were always a number of longstanding annoyances I found with EQ,
downtime, Verants insistance that tedious = hard, binding issues for melee
types, etc, but these are not the real issues that got me to move along.

For me it is that everything became too predictable, the mobs get more
powerful as you move up in level, but they behave almost exactly the same.
Pulling a orc in crushbone is almost identical to pulling a Sentry in KC.

Neither Verant or Mythic can do anything about it, really good AI is way 
to expensive in terms of resources to implement. For me the real difference
and challenge is putting real people behing some of the mobs. I beleive
that if you took the average EQ dragon, halved its capabilities, and put
a reasonably experienced person in control, that would be interesting. 
Give runny-eye, paw, permafrost, etc. to groups of players, allow character
advancement, and see what happens.

I see DAoC as and experiment in RvR, it is not perfect, but I am having
a huge amount of fun right now.
