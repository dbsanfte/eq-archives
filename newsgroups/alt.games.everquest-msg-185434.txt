Been a long time but ones I'd always have up:

Snare
Root
Camo
Whatever heal you have

Could make a strong case for keeping SoW and Panic Animal up as well,
you never know when being able to refresh SoW mid combat will save
you from a SNAFU situation.  I wouldn't keep any buffs up other than
short duration ones like the weapon imbue line, atk buffs and the
damage shield line.
