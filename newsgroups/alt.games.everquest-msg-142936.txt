Combinable items is sometimes where the money is. I had an interesting
experience yesterday.  I was selling to stacks of combinable items at 70pp
(dropped price from 100pp cos they were slow selling). Guy comes up and buys em
all and a few minutes later I see him selling them at 100pp. I reach into
another backpack and stick out two more stacks of the same items only this time
pricing at 85pp. Few minutes later same guy comes back and buys em and then
starts trying to sell em at 120pp. I stick my final stack out at 100pp - and
start getting some verbal flak from this guy! Next day I see him in Bazaar and
has hardly sold any and later puts an auction out saying he is selling cheap
40pp as he needs the money. I buy em all back at 40pp and start selling again
at 60pp. Great! Sold most of them in the next two hours as well!
