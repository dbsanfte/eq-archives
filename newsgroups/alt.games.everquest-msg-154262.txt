Well, there are certain things they can MB which would make good money (nice
drops from kunark dragons or VS etc), but honestly, the majority of kunark
dragon loot is junk (a bracer from Gore that you couldn't even sell for
2k..)

I know many people who got their epics as a result of MB, for higher end
guilds when all the melees are doing chardok faction quests, manaburn is the
only alternative for getting warrior/chanter/cleric epic parts - after
working so hard at faction, theres no way they will throw that faction away
