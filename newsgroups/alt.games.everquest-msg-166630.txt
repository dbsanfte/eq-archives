Camping is not acknowledged by Verant for the simple reason that it would
become a CS nightmare to enforce, its easier for them to say "whoever whacks
the mob first gets it", although I doubt you would be able to get a GM to
intervene if someone KSed you, except on some of the UberMobs.

Camping is a sort of unwritten rule between players (as I see it).
The Geos in Crystal Caverns are considered a "camp" pretty much universally.
I think its a good idea, because it gives a definition as to what can and
can not be killed by others in the zone.
Others may have different opinions...but that is mine.
