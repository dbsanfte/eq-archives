There are many posts about this topic on the message boards at
www.eqtraders.com.

Verant have a habit of releasing contradictory (or at least confusing) info
about trade skill successes and skill ups, but according to the last info I
know of...

Successes are solely determined by current skill level vs trivial level of
the item. Even for an item which you can no longer get skills gains from,
failure rate seems to be about 5% in my experience. Some items seem to have
a higher failure rate though - I still fail quite a lot on velium bits and
studs, even though they are way trivial.

For all trade skills, the highest of INT or WIS is the main influence on the
chance of a skill-up (success/failure may also have an affect, so better to
practice on things that are nearly trivial if possible). Some trade skills
have (or are rumoured to have :) ) a secondary stat that will also affect
the chance of a skill-up to some extent - DEX for fletching and tailoring,
STR for smithing.

As far as I know, holding the recipe book makes no difference, but it can't
hurt :)

I've also had long periods of no skill-ups, then a run of 2 or 3, but I
think this just is due to the streakiness of EQ's random number generator.
