me too... I've done this with at least three of my newbie toons....  once I
did it twice - (I was told that I distributed my attribute points
incorrectly, changed 'em to recommended, and found out later that the person
who recommendedt he change was a fool - and restored to original spec...

could be that Azalar trips one of the routines that searches for
inappropriate names?

In your position, if you've waited for days and days, I'd say either someone
else snatched up the name or it's permanently lost.  Think of another and
save yourself the hassle... and cash...  you'll need it to buy plat from
E-bay!  (whoo-hooo!)
