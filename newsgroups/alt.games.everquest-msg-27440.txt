As everyone has stated, it is an unwritten rule that camps should be respected.
 But is also should be courtesy to allow others to hunt or at least share MOBS.
 Go to Blackburrow and listen to Camp Check every 5 minutes.  You'll hear...I
got commander room, I got elite ledge,I got green room,etc.etc.  A rare spawn,
yes, I can see how that would be courteously observed by others, but common or
even semi-common spawns...NO WAY.  As the original post states, it wasn't a
rare spawn and for the most part, I don't compete for spawns, but if I hear
camp check in Highhold or Blackburrow or any other zone,RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
