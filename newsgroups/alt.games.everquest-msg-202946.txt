Frankly, the MX series of cards aren't very good, so things would
improve a bit if you upgraded.

You can reduce the lag substantially by bringing the clip plane in. 
This is done by either hitting the '-' (minus) key a bunch of times
till the world starts looking foggy in the distance, or you can do it
from the options dialog, in the display settings.

Even with a good video card, I have to bring the clip plane all the
way in when I'm in the bazaar.  Most other outdoor zones I'm ok,
unless there are a lot of players around (like in PoK when a mass
group buff is about to occur).
