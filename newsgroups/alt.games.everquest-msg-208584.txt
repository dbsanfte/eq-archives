Well, let's try some numbers (I'm big
on numbers)

Max int possible = 355
VoQ = 30 int
Necessary int to max with VoQ = 325

Nibble Deneck of Township Rebellion (who just killed Quarm)
+322 int in gear - not total, just gear
+  6 int in AA's

He's human, so his max base int is 110

That means he has 438 int before VoQ.
He can lose 113 int before VoQ doesn't max his
int.  

He can boost that to 137 with 12 more AA's

Trust me, not only will he never lose that much
int - but to come even close he's going to be 
getting some seriously great effects in exchange.

He will gladly trade unuseable int for foci/mods/
effects he doesn't otherwise have.

Hell, I trade useable int for foci - and the numbers
bear me out.

Look at my profile (int is 1 higher, and mana is
about 16 higher from my charm, but that doesn't show
because Magelo only lets you use a max stat Flag
charm.)

So, I have 239 int, 264 with KEI, 269 with VoQ.
Max for my level/aa is 280.  Now, note the Face,
bracer, earring and ring.  Very low or no int on
all of them.  According to your logic, I'd replace
them with +int gear.  Let's look at them piece by
piece.

Bracer - no int, IDIV.  That's a 10% increase in
the size of all my nukes.  Most of my mana is spent
nuking.  I have 4k mana with KEI on and 51 mana per
tick mounted with KEI/BoT9/Self Rods.  That bracer
would need to be replaced by 420 mana (10% of 4k +
the 20 on it) worth of int/mana and FT5 in order to
achieve an equivalent DPS and Damage on a full mana
bar.

Earring - no int, 0-15% mana savings on all nukes,
avg. 7.5.  This equates to an increased effectiveness
of 8%.  That's 320 (.08 x 4k + 20 on the earring) and
FT4 that I would need in it's place so I could do the
same DPS and Damage on a bar of mana.

Ring - 15% faster spells.  This takes Black Steel
from 6.3 seconds to 5.35.  With it's 2.3 second 
recast that takes BS from 163DPS (flat out chain
cast) to 183DPS.  There is no combination of items
out there that will increase my burst DPS by 20
to replace it.

Enshrouded Veil.  The stats bite, right?  But I'm
a mage, and I pet-cannibalize.  That veil adds 50
mana per reclaim, or around 45mana per tick to my
pet-canni regen rate.  No amount of int is worth
losing that effect.
