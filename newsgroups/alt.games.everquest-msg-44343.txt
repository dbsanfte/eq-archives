In the not too distant future...

[Bridge of the Satellite of Love, dirty dishes, laundry and Dominoes Pizza
boxes clutter every surface.  Mike and the bots crowd around a PC screen,
glazed looks in their eyes.  Mike, unshaven, is at the keyboard.]

TOM: You fool!  Don't you know that 1500pp is way too much to pay for a
BBACDTD???
CROW: Yeah Mike, you only need to camp the LRCD in QGCG for 12 hours to get
one.
TOM: Yeah, but his PH is a PITA.
MIKE: What?  Sorry guys, I forgot my decoder ring. [turns to face Cambot] Oh!
Hi there!  Sorry about that, we were just playing this game of wonderful and
fantastical adventure called "EverQuest".  It's a land where elves and gnomes
thrive, where dragons threaten the land, and priceless treasure can be found.
TOM & CROW: Ahhh!  TRAIN!
CROW: Azzmuncha just trained you Mike.
MIKE: How nice, what did he train me in?
TOM: Nevermind.
MIKE: Anyway, it's really quite engrossing.  It's hard to pull ourselves away.
In fact, what day is this?

[The Mads light flashes]

MIKE: Hey Dr. F.
DR. FORRESTER: Hello Mike, bots.  Oh my, I'm glad I haven't installed
smell-o-vision yet.  That place is a disgrace!
MIKE: Sorry, it's this great game we're playing called...
DR. F: You and your games, I knew it was a mistake to give you Internet
access.  However, I have just the payback for you.
MIKE: What's that Dr. Forrester?
DR. F: It seems that a certain "Tracii Loures" has decided to quit playing
that stupid little game.
TOM: Hey, them's fightin' words!

[Mike glares at Tom.]

MIKE (shrugging): So what?  More bandwidth for us!
ALL: Woohoo!
DR. F: No no no, you don't understand.  "She" decided to let the whole world
know about it on alt.games.everquest.  I immediately decided I could use her
misdirected anger for purposes of EVIL!  Bwahahaha!
MIKE: I don't like where this is going, guys...
DR. F: That's right!  Get ready for "I've quit this rotten, pile-of-shit
game..."

MIKE: We've got USENET sign!!

[Much flashing of lights and chaos ensues.]

<6> <5> <4> <3> <2> <1> ...

[The familiar shadowy figures enter the theater.]

>"Tracii Loures" <traciiloures@home.com> wrote in message

CROW: Hey, I'm a big fan of her movies.
MIKE: Better read that name again, Crow.

TOM: It's the abuse that makes it fun!
CROW: Sorry Servo, I don't swing that way.

> First of all, this is not a troll.

TOM: I repeat, this is not a troll!  Please proceed to the nearest exits!
This is NOT a troll!

> This is my farewell forever to EQ.

MIKE: Hemingway's A Farewell to EQ will always be my favorite.
CROW: A moving story of post-traumatic-EQ syndrome.
TOM: Soon to be a blockbuster motion picture from New Line!

> Of course, a lot of you out there are already saying, "Good,
> one less person camping <insert item here>."

ALL: Woohoo!
CROW: Maybe she's Azzmuncha
MIKE: No, Azzmuncha was a male, no one would play as one gender and post to
USENET with another.
[Bots snicker.]

> That's fine.

> you to skip down to the section "Taken from lumthemad.net"

TOM: Hey Mike, you know that beautiful wood elf you met the other day?
MIKE (dreamily): Ah yes, Aaeileaia.  We already have a date for when I get off
of this satellite.
TOM: Well, she sent me some real life pictures.
MIKE (uncertainly): Hey, our relationship is about more than looks.
CROW: Is it about more than gender?
MIKE: What do you mean?
[Bots howl with laughter.]
TOM: Oh, nothing.

> for an interesting little bit from the CEO of Sony Online
> Entertainment (eg. Verant's parent company), Kelly Flock.

TOM: CEO?  Interesting?  Something's wrong there.

> The decision to leave has been too long in coming, but I finally

> the designers should be horse-whipped.

TOM: I wonder how long she played before she came to this conclusion?
MIKE: Usually I can tell if something is terrible within a matter of minutes.
CROW: And besides, aren't horses a bit big to swing around for whipping?
MIKE: I think that's a feature of the next expansion.

MIKE: Or in your case, to say the most.
TOM: But oddly, while saying nothing at the same time.
[All hum the twilight zone theme.]

> I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm all for losing myself in a good game;

CROW: Then hurry up and lose yourself!  We won't come looking.

> but this game is quite simply

MIKE: Well, let's not forget the people that rant and rave when they *quit*
said game.
TOM: Yeah, not to mention those that reply to said rant.
CROW: Of course, then there are those that read said reply.
[The three of them slowly turn to look back at the audience, then snap back to
the screen.]
MIKE: Ever feel like you're being watched?
[Bots shudder.]

CROW: By committing yourself to the Betty Ford clinic?
TOM: By knocking over the nearest convenience store to pay for phat lewtz?

> As if that weren't bad enough, Verant's treatment of their

CROW: I just had the strangest sense of deja-vu.
TOM: Wasn't this covered in the intro?

> Most people are aware of

MIKE: What?  Grabbing their ankles?  What does that have to do with customer
support?
[Crow whispers something to Mike.]
MIKE (shocked): CROW!
CROW: You asked.

> Well, I for one am mercifully free of this crap and I will
> NEVER again let myself get drawn into a game (or anything else) that
> requires you sideline everything else in your life.

TOM (announcer style): And so Tracii's once cherished ambitions of having
children, an education, a job, and becoming a famed kazoo player fell by the
wayside.

> I leave you all

CROW: Mmmm, Insight.  I love enchanters.
TOM: Snap out of it Crow.

>   Suffice it to say, I will never purchase or own

MIKE: I'm glad she clarified that, I was afraid she may purchse a Verant
product but NOT own it.

> Farewall,

> Former denizen of Rallos Zek

CROW: Hey, Rallos Zek!
TOM: That sure explains a lot.

CROW: Big reward if returned to its rightful owner!

TOM: Dammit, somebody let the CEO out of their cage again.  Call the
authorities.

MIKE: Look out, she's gonna blow!
CROW (scottish accent): She canna take anymore growth, cappin.

TOM: Damn the experts.  DAMN THEM TO HELL.  I want my primal weapons available
off of EC merchants!

> "No, we never talk to consumers they just fuck us up.

MIKE: Hey, what's this thing rated, anyway?
CROW (grumbling): Damn pesky consumers... they always ruin everything.

TOM: Market research?  We don't need no steenkin market research.
MIKE: Bah, it's only the CEO of the parent company.  It's not like he had
anything to do with EQ.  He's more out of touch than... than... a rusty sword
is to a sewer rat!
CROW: How very uber of you Mike.
MIKE: Thanks!

CROW: We may not know what we want, but we know it when we see it!

> We just want to know if they have a valid credit card."

TOM: I know what *I* want: a valid credit card.
MIKE: Sick of using the invalid ones?

> Well, hell. This explains a lot, doesn't it? No wonder customer

MIKE (holding Crow's beak): Not a word.
CROW (muffled): I was just wondering where to get an Electrolux thingy.

> the CEO of the bloody place thinks that we the customers
> will only fuck them up.

CROW: Hey, I've often wondered why we, the customers, aren't allowed to run
the businesses we give our money to.  Why, just think of it!  If the customers
of the local supermarket were allowed to have their way, everything would cost
a penny!  Who says I have to return my rented vehicles?  *I'M* the customer!
Video rentals?  Keep 'em as long as you want!  The customers say so!  It would
be paradise!
TOM (under his breath): Pinko commie.
CROW: What?
TOM: Oh nothing.

> Er... Smed? Smed?

MIKE: Damn, looks like I need that decoder ring again.

> You wanna try and explain this to us in a way that us silly shits
> can understand?

TOM: Hey, let me give it a try: Listening to the customers without any clear
direction would quickly lead to chaos, and an unplayable game.
MIKE: Well, sure, but why not take some of their suggestions?
CROW: Well, they would never...
TOM: Hold on a minute guys, what about hybrid penalties?  TCC code getting
removed from Luclin?  More, faster boats?  Rogue upgrades?  Death penalty XP
loss reduction?
CROW: Those were just a SLAP IN THE FACE to all that started the game in the
first Beta and had to SUFFER through horrible xp loss, boat crashes, and
leveling a Troll SK to level 60.  I DEMAND JUSTICE.
MIKE: Quick Tom!  Help me sedate him!  I think this godforsaken rant is over,
let's get out of here!

[They Exit.]

[Satellite of Love Bridge, everything is cleaned up, solitaire can be seen on
the PC screen.]

CROW (much calmer): Say, I'm glad Tracii finally showed us the light.  No more
being forced to play that game with every minute of free time that we have.
Who would've thought that we had free will this entire time?
MIKE: Yeah Crow, that was a close call.  We should all be thankful.

[Mads light flashes.]

[Deep 13, Dr. F is staring blankly at a computer screen.]

TOM: Hey there Dr. Forrester, whatcha doing?
DR. F: I said I was OOM!  Why do they never listen?  Oh, hi guys.  Feeling any
ill effects?
MIKE: No sir, in fact that post finally cured us!  We now see that silly game
for what it is.
CROW: That's right, no more being forced to camp the AC for endless hours.  I
sure wish that wasn't a required part of the game.
DR. F (looking back at PC): lol, we owned that orc pawn.
MIKE: Sir?  Are you ok?
DR. F: I can quit any time I want to!
MIKE: Well kids, let this be a lesson to you.  EQ addiction is very serious
business.  It should not be played if you are pregnant, have a heart
condition, or enjoy sleep.  Help is available.  See you next time.
[Reaches over to push The Button]
DR. F: No!  Don't pull the centurion!
