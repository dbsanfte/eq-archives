will you show some decorum and not swear?  When have you start speaking for
all of Norath / the player base?  If you took a poll I'm sure any (100 %) 50
+ enchanter would want extra spell slots.  Probably any 50 + caster.

in truth you don't need every spell memorized at once.  It decidedly makes
it a different puzzle when you can though.  Its also less of a handicap, and
definitely more fun.  SOL's new spells to me is more of a yea, more spells I
gotta siphon thru some archaic system, not jumping for joy over them.

the below petition I'm asking people to join before I bring it to the powers
that be is not asking for the ability to cast every spell.  Its asking for a
few extra spell slots that you have to spend AA exp on.

And finally, I really don't care how many people were / are against me on
this, as the fact of being right is in of itself enough.  someone start by
arguing that DAOC doesn't have an advantage over EQ because its not limited
in spell slots, and I might have to rethink my position.  (probably not for
very long, though).  Also note that they definitely use spell slots in much
the same way, but I think you got 80 spell slots / hotkeys to do with
whatever you want.  Effectively I didn't notice a bottlecap that you do in
EQ.
