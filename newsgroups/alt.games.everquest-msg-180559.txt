Greetings!

Here is the deal. I have 3 month subscription Everquest game card Id like to
exchange for some plat on Saryrn server. I was thinking 5K for 3 months game
time sounds fair.

This card is new. I would be willing to supply a phone number to call me if
you would like. I can either give you info at time of exchange of plat or
mail you card. If your not interested in selling 5K plat for 3 months of
game time I would be willing to sell card for $25 outright.

Thanks
