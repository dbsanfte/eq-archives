Few things to consider, the biggest being the AGE of the game engine.
The game's been live for, what, 5 years now? And the game was in
developement for several years before that. It's old technology, and
collision detection was a lot harder to do then.

Also, every mob they put collision detection on will up the amount of
server load required. Hundreds of zones each with hundreds of mobs
with collision detection AI's will add up real quick. Again, this
becoming such a big issue traces back to old technology.

Anyway, next time you have a mob fall into a tree and want to loot it,
try typing /tar followed by the first several letters of the mob's
name (if there are spaces, insert underscores _ where the spaces are).
It should target the corpse. Then just type /loot.
