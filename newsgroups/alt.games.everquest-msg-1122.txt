> Druid is the "easiest" class to play.

Actually its the most fun and well rounded class to play, but definitely not
the easiest. Cleric and Shaman are just as easy to play as druid, and what
about warriors whoes main purpose is to soak up dmg. By "easiest" you
probably mean easiests to get around because of teleport spells, heals,
regen, etc.
