While the dark blue con range is pretty large -- mob levels 39 and up 
will be dark blue at 52 -- there is a significant xp bonus for mobs 
no less than five levels below you.

Mobs on the plateau in SD are mostly 44-45. Elsewhere in that zone
they're lower. Thus once you hit 51 the xp should have slowed down
considerably. Time to move to a new zone if fast xp is important.
