For comaprison of the best tanks :p

warrior 1390
sk 1320
pally 1260
monk 1110

I pretty much think that these values should hold up in the guilds that have
access to anything as long as they are willing to spend the time . All 4
have room for improvement . The monk is also a leezard that is supposed to
confer an ac bonous . The paladin is the best equipped being in full kunark
and kael armor.

My druid btw has a 903 ac now :p
