Since you are so unappreciated I think your best course of action would
be to just walk away from the whole thing.  Why bother if all you get is
bitched at and no pay.  Just trash the whole thing, stop trying to be a

trying to get into boring flame wars on  these newsgroups.  If you are
gonna flame can it at least be on a topic that is interesting instead of
something stupid like which browsers folks prefer?  Maybe TLC or who is
most uber?
