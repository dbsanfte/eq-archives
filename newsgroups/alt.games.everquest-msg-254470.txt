Where is the relationship between mana pool and downtime?
My 37 Cleric has 150 wis,my 42 Enc 146 Int,never had a problem
with not enough mana,solo or grouped.
Much more important to have the best posibble survivability,
speak hitpoints and ac.
When I look for updates,I sort for hitpoints,not wis or int.
Too bad I wear the MP2 ring from PoK,or I would use 2
Adamantite bands.
I am always shocked,when I throw a Greater Heal on a
caster at half health,and see it does not heal for its full potential.

Note, we are talking about the low-mid level game here.
