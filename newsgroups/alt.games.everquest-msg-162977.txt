Well, if you plan on spending the rest of your character's career doing
nothing but xp groups on greens and light blues and low blues, I'd say
you could chuck your gear into the trash or sell it in the bazaar to buy
more fish rolls and Ping Fuzzlecutters.

However, if you are (or plan on being) in a guild that's ever going to
kill anything bigger than Vox and Naggy, you'll not only need to hang on
to it but likely do massive upgrades to it.

Vox and Naggy are, without question, the two wimpiest dragons in the
game and usually the first place that players come up against an AoE. 
Later on, you'll look back and chuckle at how gimp the AoE's of Lady Vox
and Lord Nagafen are. You'll also need resists for more than Fire and
Cold.  When you start tackling Kunark Drgons (usually a next logical
raiding step where you'll want resist gear) you'll find that your
current gear is often woefully inadequate. And some dragons don't use
fire and cold. (Helloooooooo Trakenenon! /RUDE POISON AOE's!)

The point will likely come when you are of a high enough level that
you'll be naturally immune to many AoE's and not worry about it so much.
(I seem to recall Martin saying that he didn't bother with any resist
gear against pre Luclin dragons at level sixty.)  But at level 57 I
still carry a full resits kit, use it on most bigger encounters, and
*MUST* use it on some or I get cooked up for dinner faster than you can
ring the bell to come eat.
