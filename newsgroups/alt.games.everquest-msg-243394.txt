Did you go all the way top to bottom? That can hurt.

Damage you take from a fall is based on a couple of things:
Distance fell
The amount of weight you are carrying

Usually when someone slips in velks they drop to the next ledge or
something. Clear from the top to the bottom is a long drop.

The beastlord may have a safefall skill (monks and rogues have it for sure),
and it mitigates the damage somewhat. (I know that Vah Shir get safe fall ~
50 automatically too iirc).

I've also died (hit for many k) edging off a 2 foot step carrying an obscene
amount of plat and gear while sotw'd and moving like I'm snared. It doesn't
even matter how encumbered you are... my war takes more damage off this one
shortcut jump I take regularly than my enchanter does... neither is
encumbered, but the warrior is carrying almost 3x the load.
