I think you need to add a tiny pause in between the commands, so the program
doesnt think you're trying to spam everyone. I think you change the /pet
attack line to:
/pause 5, /pet attack

I hardly ever use multi-line socials, so thats probably not quite right. The
comma in there might be a semi-colon or something, and the pause number
might be too low, or too high. I guess I'm not too helpful. :)
