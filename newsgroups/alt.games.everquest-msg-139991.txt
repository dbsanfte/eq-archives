Spell Research also works that way.  Tradeskills do not however, put one
point into a tradeskill, get it at level 1, whether you are level 1 or level
60.  Don't know about poison making, Alchemy does work the same way though,
one point gives you one point in the skill.  For tradeskills, you cannot
train them above 21.  Poison making and Spell Research can be trained above
21.
