Spells are generally balanced so that they require you to have a maxed skill
at the level where you get them to get a decent casting success rate.

At level 29, the wizard's max alteration is around 150.   "Average" is
somewhere around 50 - 60 skill, IIRC.   So, yes, he's about 70 or so points of
alteration away from being able to cast it, and 100 away from being able to
cast it almost every time.

I think your friend needs to find a low mana cost alteration spell that
wizards can cast, and spend a couple hours practicing.  Maybe while he waits
for you to take the boat. ; )
