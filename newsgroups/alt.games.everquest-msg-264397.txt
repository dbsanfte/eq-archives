Me, too. I thought I saw this somewhere earlier. Might be something that's 
coming. The other thing that's odd about the current system is how you get 
them all automatically at mini-ding. I don't like that, either, and I'm 
hoping it's another one of those placeholder things that gets updated as we 
approach release. Doesn't make sense to see my Swimming update because I 
killed another gnoll lol.
