If they spend all this downtime fixing bugs why are we seeing the same bugs
that have been in the game since it started and why are the new bugs not
getting fixed.  Verant offers anything but good customer service, unless you
call disinformation customer service.  Their policy is simple, take no
responsibility and acknowledge no problems other than those they have to.

There is no question that this is a complex operation and that running a
game of this scale is not easy, but it is also certain that Verant is not
truthful with its customer base and is constantly manipulating the game to
force players to take more time to do what they did easily in the past.
Verant's greatest fear is that too many players will get to the high levels
grow bored and leave the game, and to stop this they constantly make the
game more and more difficult in the middle levels while claiming to be
fixing exploits and bugs.  Actually, for Verant an exploit is anything that
allows a player to level too fast and risk them getting bored and moving on
to greener pastures.  The weakness of this plan is that as players develop
an understanding of the game and the way it is manipulated the grow tired or
manipulation and leave anyway or grow tired of the constant technical
headaches caused by Verant's untested code and inability to maintain stable
servers.  The fact is most players put up with Verant and their
manipulations because they enjoy the society of the people the play with and
given an alternative that improved on Verant's performance would likely
leave EQ.
