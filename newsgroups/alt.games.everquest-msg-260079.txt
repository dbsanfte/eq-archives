Yep, shooting themselves in the foot in the long run, I know for myself I
wont touch any mmorpg that has known cheats / hacks (or more to the point,
nothing done about said cheats once discovered), sure they may retain some
of their original subscribers (and get a few more), but overall by taking
that kind of stance they are only ensuring the game will stagnate well
before it reaches anything like its prime.

Have said for months WoW will likely be shit, or turn out shit, vanguard is
the one I am watching now, since Warhammer online development has ceased
(last I heard).

Shame as the magic system in WHO sounded groovy :)
