Sure, there are some good reasons to choose EverQuest II over World
of Warcraft because of the type of players each is likely to attract.
But if you want to verify this, try playing the WoW open beta or seeing
what current beta players have to say about the game.  Even just seeing
what sort of stupid things WoW fans on the forums have to say about WoW
could tell you something about the player base.  But the fact that they
say stupid things about EQ2 is a given and tells you nothing.

Hmm... I think Sony Online Entertainment is telling me something about
themselves by now requiring JavaScript to be enabled to read their forums.
