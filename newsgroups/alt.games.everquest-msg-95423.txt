I found it easier, tho still painfully slow, to procupine/dot the wisps,
(i.e. both damage shields up and pull the wisp with a dot) using mana to
heal just enough to stay alive and then nuking to finish when the wisp
had beat itself into fleeing.  By easier I mean that starting at L10 I
could kill any blue con wisp with this technique.  It is also worth
noting that by the time I started killing the occassional wisp I had
the three pieces of Bearhide armor available from the Millers and the
rest was all store-bought leather, which gives a decent ac for a caster
at that level.

For magic weapon, once I had saved up about 50pp I went to Lavastorm and
bought a Combine Warhammer (at least I think it was Lavastorm where I
found gypsies with blunt weapons).  That allowed me to kill wisps (and
anything else for that matter) much quicker and at lower mana cost.

I haven't played much on FV for a while now.  My L15 human druid has
enough pp saved to buy some magic jewelry, but I couldn't find any
jewelers, and that combined with difficulty grouping on FV and having
joined a new guild with my main on Tunare combined to take my interest
away from FV server.
