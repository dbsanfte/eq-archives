I am sure EQ lost customers to DAoC, as they did to AO, but the majority of
their customers stayed. My EQ friends that went to DAoC left for a couple of
reasons 1) They were going to quit EQ anyways, were at the point were they
were just burned out 2) They always have to play the newest game out there.
Most have returned or they have quit EQ and DAoC. A few continue to play
DAoC and seem quite happy with it. But, they don't claim either game as
being better just different.
As far as the remarks made some time ago regarding listening to the customer
I think you missed the meaning of what was said because you took it out of
context. If I remember correctly the point being made was that if they had
listened to the customers or did market research from the beginning then EQ
would have been a much different game. The developers of EQ went outside of
what was considered standard online gaming when they created EQ and if they
had listened we would have ended up with a Diablo/Unreal/Ultima type game.
Thankfully they had thier own vision and stuck to it.
One additional comment I think DAoC has been good for EQ overall, it forced
EQ to better thier CS department and some of the dweebs left. Oh might you
be one of those dweeps, hehe.
