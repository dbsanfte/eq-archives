Well, it's definite that it does NOT make an item trivial
that's not already.   If something trivials at 102, for instance,
and your skill is 100, holding a 5% item does NOT make it
trivial.  Been there, done that.

The best guess I've heard it that they give 5% to your
chance of a successful combine.   Not noteworthy for
a lot of stuff, but very good on high-skill, expensive to
make items.
