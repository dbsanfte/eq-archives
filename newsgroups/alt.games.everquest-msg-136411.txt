If you go to FP, you'll end up in BBM, not FV.

As to easiest?  At 53, what are you worried about in DL to FV run?  Total
time to FV is about 5 mins from the druid ring in DL.  Just throw on a SoW
and Lev (or SoE? what level is that, anyway?  My Druid is just 34 and I
don't know) and make the run.

So, what was your leveling path?  at 34, I would like to know when I decide
to work my taxi up a few levels.
