Exact messages, in case anyone was wondering:

 Success on a Trivial item:
   You can no longer advance your skill from making this item.
   You have fashioned the items together to create something new!

 Failure on a Trivial item:
   You lacked the skills to fashion the items together.

(Variation:  If you fail on a combine that gives you some of
your ingredients back -- like getting the empty bottle back
on some brewing failures -- you also get:
   You have fashioned the items together to create 
   an alternate product.
)

Success/failure on non-Trivial items are the same, except
for the lack of the "You can no longer advance" message.

And FYI, the reason the Trivial point is called, well, "trivial",
is because the "can no longer advance" message *used* to
say, "This item is trivial for someone of your skill level to make."
But that was changed because so many people were complaining,
"if it's trivial, how did I fail??"
