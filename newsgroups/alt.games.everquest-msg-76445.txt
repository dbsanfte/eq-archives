This is interesting and pretty much echoes my experience.  The procs are about
3 normally with a dex of about 89.  The procs and skill increases are what I am
looking for.

From what you say , it would appear pretty normal to have that low number of
procs.  This leads me to think that a nice proc on a weapon is actually less
important than a good dmg/speed ratio

I have a beetle stinger too as I am concentrating on piercing 1hs and 2hs and
archery.  I do not use the beetle when doing 1hs or 2hs for anything as I
always pull with a bow - I dont use a shield either as I am a barb and slam and
want to dual wield anyway

Thanks for the info
