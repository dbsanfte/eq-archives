Are you seriously equating the situation of two people, one who's motivated
the enjoyment of playing the game, and the other who's motivated by the
opportunity to make himself some money?

Would you be willing to camp something for 60 hours just to have it?  How
about if someone gave you a thousand dollars for it?  Not enough?  How about
ten thousand dollars?  Would the answer to that question only be based on
how much money you'd be offered?
