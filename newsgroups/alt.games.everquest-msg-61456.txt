Mistake #1 - and the most common mistake that I, as a shaman, have
seen in this game.  Contrary to what people might think, we are not
exactly the best of healers.  No better than a druid or ranger of
comparable level.  The fact that you obviously had a crappy player
behind that toon does not mitigate this fact.  I can buff you to the
moon... I can slow mobs as well, or better, than any class.  Same for
DoTing... but we are still only capable of healing 270 hp's until lvl
53... maybe enough to heal a caster, but to rely on that to keep a
group of tanks, or even rogues, alive in a bad pull situation is pure
folly.

Had you, or any other person, or persons in the group just been
buffed?  How about hasted?  Or already healed?  High hp's and low mana
still equal death for most shammies... we can melee, but only as a
last resort.  Again, it might be inexperience, or a difference in play
styles - I would have kept casting gheal until I was dead or a tank
had gotten the agro off of me, but that is me.  I know just as many
druids and rangers that will sit there and watch a PC die because they
weren't the healer...

That was a reasonable, and appropriate action... personally, I would
have probably done it right after the above incident, and found
another, preferably more capable (read - cleric) healer.
