Well I admit I didn't get to amiable entirely in GD for the same reason
you mentioned, boredom.  I was quad kiting green wolves for most of the
faction there, grabbing a giant when I could find one.  There is another
zone that is great for mid to uppper 40s soloing with moderate exp and
great CoV faction, but I consider that area my private reserve since I
never see anyone there and am not about to advertise it here hehe. 
Actually I'd probably get hatemail if I did since its a deathtrap unless
you are up to the challenges.
