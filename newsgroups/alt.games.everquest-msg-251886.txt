Hi Jennaii;

I have a 65 Cleric.  All the type 3 and type 7 augs add up to FT9.  I spent
a lot of time getting the equipment to put them in. (I only need 2 more
Guk's for the last aug). There are 2 type 8 augs for a total of FT3. Not
sure what type 8 is, I just know I don't have anything like that.  The
cleric gear, as others have pointed out is pretty good for someone like me
that is not time flagged. I had to save up points, then buy the right gear
with a type 3 slot, then had to save up for the FT aug to go in it. It has
been well worth it. The gear and FT augs make a very nice combo that will
last a non-flagged character for quite awhile.
