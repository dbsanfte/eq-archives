Finally got the bastard last night. Friends had told me it only had
one placeholder, and some online guides confirmed that, so I hadn't
been killing too many of the other barracudas. Last night, I was
buffing a monk who was killing bloodgills and asked him if he wanted
to help out when a tainted spawned. He was delayed by running into one
of the other barracudas, so he killed it while I finished off the dud
tainted. Next spawn cycle, there was a dw barracuda in the spot I was
camping, and a dark blue tainted in the spot further south where he'd
just killed a fish... Hollered for the monk again and he helped me
finish off tainted and corrupted :)
(Now, if I ever get my hands on whoever it was that came up with the
idea that only the one fish at -900,-900 and none of the others would
spawn it... >:) )
