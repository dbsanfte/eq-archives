I'd always figured that Druids and Shaman were good at disease and poison
because of their familiarity with plants and animals.  That is, when a Druid
or Shaman cures someone, while all we see in game is them waving their arms
around and casting a spell, they are also slipping you something to eat or
drink that they made from plants and animals.

Besides...Clerics could always completely cure any poison or disease: just
let the person die, and res them. :-)
