Don't have SoL, but I did get the regular patch this morning.
Tried to run Everquest (it has the EULA now in "everquest" format instead of
"windows" format and the background image of the main menu has also been
changed) but my zonealarm popped up.
Had to restart computer because of the bloody EQ restriction of not getting
back to the program when focus has been on something else and all sorts of
screen-res mess-ups and windows-alerts which can't be clicked away.

Had to go to work before pc rebooted so I won't know anything till tonight.

<sigh>

This is gonna be a long day at work.
