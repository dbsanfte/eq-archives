Changing topic slightly, for me *most* of the epics are still worth 
doing for most people.

Ones still worth it:

Cleric (free rez)
Bard (haste proc, 80% all instruments, weapon)
Rogue (40% worn haste, 40atk, 9ac, 15/25)
Monk (40% song haste, 40atk, 12ac, glove slot, nice stats)
Ranger  (40% worn haste, 30atk 13/21, 50% slow proc on earthcaller)
Wizard (800hp rune + 3m per tick)
Warrior (+500 hate proc)
Beastlord (40% worn haste / 55% slow proc)
Mage (manifest elements, summons epic pet)
Druid (55hp dot for 3mins)
Shaman (1.2k dot done in 90seconds (creeping dot))

Epics NOT worth the bother (in MY opinion):

Paladin (150dd + 1.5 sec stun, 35/40)
Necromancer (55dot + snare)
Enchanter (66% clicky haste)
Shadowknight (lifetap dot, 50hp a tick for 5 ticks)

Could possibly move the warrior to the not worth it list depending on 
there resources, but would imagine it would be easier to farm the cash 
(and maybe take less time) and buy an EB weapon of some sort than do the 
epic. For non-high end uber people, most of the epics do still hold up 
against newer items (I would always use swiftwind for archery if I had 
it, unless I can get another 40% + 30atk weapon with better stats, that 
CANT be used in primary (timespinner maybe?  ).

------------------------------------------
I've seen many people say the warrior epic isn't worth it, outclassed by 
easily gotten weapons, and very annoying to get.

I personally think the mage epic isn't worth getting, as the pet it 
summons is outclassed in most interesting circumstances by 61/62 pets, 
and getting it looks extremely arduous.  I mean, look at the Pegasus 
Cloak; camp a zone with nothing blue in it at all for a rare spawn who 
might appear anywhere in a very wide radius, for a rare drop (legs, 
which are useless, are his common drop).  This might be a good idea for 
a ranger epic, but its a nightmare for a mage, who doesn't have track; 
even if the damn pony does pop there's probably going to be a tracker on 
it before you find out.

Then there's Phinny.  What a fun guy; pops once every 12 to 14 hours, 
rarely drops the piece you need.  At least its a valid "mage epic" 
target since COTH combined with a no drop invis is very handy for 
getting your kill force there.

And a drop in Air, the plane its probably hardest to get people to go to.

I haven't even read up on the rest of it, with pieces retailing for 
100kpp each and knowing how unlikely it is that I'll ever see any of 
them drop legitimately, -and- knowing that its main advantage, the epic 
pet, is going to be outclassed by POP era spells which are -very- easy 
to come by... well what do I want to bother for?

Bard epic not only has boost to all instruments, but to Singing, which 
is a pretty hard thing to come by and a serious boost; I think its 
better than you do!

Cleric epic is worth getting for its clicky effect, but is a "carry it 
in a bag until needed" item.  Luckily its relatively easy to get, and 
easy to recruit help for; funny thing is, assuming the cleric is level 
56+, its more useful to others than to the cleric himself!
