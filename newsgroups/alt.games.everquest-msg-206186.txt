EK/NK/WK/SK are all good. SolA comes to mind also.

In SK, you're probalby close to ready for Avaiks (you may find a group
there). Into the mid-high 20's, you can hunt around the SK spires (entrance
to PAW). Late 20's into the mid 30's you can hunt the first areas of Paw for
some pretty solid xp (even in the post Luclin era). You may need to push it
some there. In the higher 30's, you may be able to find a group in SolB -
which has excellent xp. That could well take you into the 50ish range, and
you should easily have the rest of the exapansions by then. :)
