Im a 36th Magician on E'ci...

I need to get into the ballroom in Mistmoore Castle.

Today i dropped in through the jail, and began soloing my way as far as i
could.. Which wasnt very far.. So I parked myself and began to explore the
dungeon using an eye. Yeah, there is no way im gonna be able to do this
alone :p
Anwyway, so I am beginning to organize a group to take it now.  Can a
well-balanced, well-organized group of 6  with an average level of 40 hold
the ballroom?   If so what is the best way to get there? Lots of people have
told me NOT to go through the front door, but go through the jail.. Well
thats a MUCH longer route, and SEEMS a lot more dangerous.. Should we fight
are way to the ballroom from the jail, or should we go invis? IF we go
through invis, where do we set up camp to break the ballroom... In the piano
room? or in the entry courtyard? Our group will most likely consist of:
magician, enchanter, druid, cleric, bard, warrior.. Sounds like we need
another tank. Any tips will be very helpfull..
