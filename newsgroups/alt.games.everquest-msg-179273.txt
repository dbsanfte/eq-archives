    I'll believe it when I (don't) see it. Every other time they said they
fixed it when I was on the old UI, it was still there. So I move to the new
UI when forced, and it shows up there within a week!

    Graffe's, find something new to whine about, like pointy hats!

    Ooh, I can make stuff in the field now! Does anyone know if Velious
combines can be done in the collapsible kit? I thought I remembered trying

    But we'll have plenty of time to practice on new Fennin, because RZ has
been beefed up too! Woot!
