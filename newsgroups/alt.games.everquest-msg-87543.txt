 Hey, you won't have to drop it altogether (I still swing at mobs from
time to time) but soloing when you miss more than half the time
becomes futile. You'll reach a point where you'll kill faster by root
dotting and medding back the mana for the dot while it is working than
by fear kite meleeing, even with a big nice weapon.
