Highly focused pets (MoD focused MSIV is level 65) have a ~60% hit
rate.  When some of the mages complained, we were told that that is
actually about the same as high end melee.  So you're pretty close
on that.  About a 66% DPS increase then.

Check out the safehouse or beastlords.org - rogues and BL's have 
disciplines that look exactly like that, and they have probably parsed
it out.

Ahhh - but if they are on different timers then you'll be able to 
alternate them.

It will be interesting to see how the class evolves - they certainly are
a work in progress.  How long did it take for BL's to be a fully developed
class?  A year?
