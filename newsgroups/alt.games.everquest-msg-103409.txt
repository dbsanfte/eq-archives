It drives me nuts when the tanks issue the command, "Run away!, Run Away",
and the casters won't budge.  I've seen numerous instances when the tanks
are just trying to hold the mobs long enough for the casters to get a head
start before they too start to run.  Instead, the oom casters decide to join
the melee, and the tanks are left with the choice of just bailing and
letting the idiots die, or facing the inevitable death.  On the other hand,
I can see where healers hate tanks who keep pulling after the healers have
anounced that they are LOM, or OOM.

I don't know, maybe it's the "Jarhead" in me, but I figure the tanks should
be the first ones in and the last ones out. It's hard for a tank to come out
looking smelling like a rose if he runs and lets the casters die.  At best
the casters should listen to the tanks and run while the tanks fight a rear
guard action.
