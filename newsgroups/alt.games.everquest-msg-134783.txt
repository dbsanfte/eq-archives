Do NOT use the /who command.  It'll freeze the screen and you have to 
restart.  Dunno which versions of it work and don't work, was hearing 
various claims from various people.  Personally I did one /who <nick>, 
froze, restarted, and stayed far away from any /who version all night :)  
Strange, though, because I used it this afternoon before work while 
running from Oasis to the NK spires to the Bazaar and it never did 
anything of the kind.

Sold 170pp worth of spider silks tonight and got bored of waiting for 
everything else to sell, so I opened up the search window - VERY nice, 
btw, despite it's tendency to stop showing search results for some 
reason - some people say it's because 'the items have already sold' - 
although I seriously doubt that many searches could result in that, if 
that's the case - others said it was because the search window got 
bugged if you gave it 'too many search requirements'.  I dunno.  
Searching for a ssoy tonight I couldn't get a result with 'ykesha' nor 
'short sword of the ykesha', so I went with 'short sword' and went down 
the list to find one.  Same thing happened when I typed in 'mask of the 
eight eyes', so I typed in mask.  Seems to fix the problem.  

Anyway, as I was saying before, I opened up the search window and looked 
around for some nice str items for my rogue (yes, I'm obsessed over 
getting the largest backstab damage possible).  160 plat later, I had a 
mask of the eight eyes (30), boots of scale (50), a bloodstained mantle 
(10), a spore covered tunic (50), and a cougar claw earring (20).  This 
is SO much easier than sifting through allakhazam's, randomly writing 
down a few things that *might* do, doing a price check on each one, and 
then trying to find the actual item.  Now I can enter the stat I want, 
along with my class and race, and then sort the resulting list by name, 
price, or seller.  Right clicking on the seller's name, btw, will point 
you in the direction of the seller, so by pressing the up arrow on your 
keyboard with one hand while keeping up the right clicking with your 
other hand, it's a snap finding the seller you want.

The problem with finding the seller is, there seems to be a 30-item 
limit on selling.  So if you find something you want, find the seller, 
and open the window, you won't be able to tell if they have sold it 
(since apparently, the game is a bit slow in updating that way), or 
still have it and it's just too deep in the inventory.  And many many 
many many MANY sellers were AFK tonight.

Lag, predictably, was a huge problem.  Seeing as the who command doesn't 
work, I didn't get an exact number, but I got a screenshot of about 2, 
maybe 3 little sub-stalls worth of traders.

Now multiply that by how many sub-stalls exist altogether... *g*  I 
looked mostly at the floor for quite awhile, until someone pointed out 
that lowering the clip plane bar would help, too.

Spam, also, was a HUGE problem.  Despite the fact that you can now 
search through items to find exactly what you're looking for, several 
morons still found it necessary to advertise, and many of them, instead 
of using /auction, used /ooc or /shout.  But hey, at least the chat 
filter came in handy :D

Also, I'm not sure if this has always been true, so I'll mention it just 
in case - apparently, being encumbered doesn't matter in the bazaar.  
It'll tell you you're encumbered, but it won't affect your movement.  
Didn't have a chance to check (changed all my banking backpacks to 
trader's satchels before I heard that ;p) but a few different people 
shouted it without anyone contradicting them, so...

And finally, /camp desktop *also* seems to be bugged.  Both times I've 
typed it since the patch, I've ended up back at the server select screen 
instead.

Oh, and there may be another patch ahead?  I'm not sure.  There was a 
global message tonight stating that they were taking down Q Hills and a 
few other zones tonight at 3am PST.

Ryou
(overall, pretty happy with the change)
