A few times, I have had trouble getting places due to faction and
boats. FV is closed to Iksar because those Guards will slice and dice
you for hailing the Gnome ("Hey thats our gnome! *SMACK* *SMACK*) and
you can't get off Sister Island if the Sisters hate you.

Either tweak the gnome placement, or bring back boats.

I personally found it nice to chat on a boat, met a lot of nice people
that way. I remember my first Field of Bone trip...
