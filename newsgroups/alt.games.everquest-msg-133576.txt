}second floor mobs dont see invis

Which is a wonderful thing... provided invis doesn't drop on you at an 
inopportune moment. :) They also won't aggro if you're about 2/3 of the 
way up the wall, but not higher.

By the way, is that -all- 2nd floor mobs?  I know many don't... but 
someday I'd like to explore and not be suprised. :)
