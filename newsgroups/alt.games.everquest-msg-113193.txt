Ok heres the deal with Druids and don't care if you like it or not.
Will keep it short and simple for ya since you have never heard of a
sow potion and therefore must be a noob.

We are sick and tired of being pestered by lame arses for our buffs
who have in all probability said "We don't need a druid in the group
get other guy" many times.

We are fed up with "friends" who always seem to need something from us
when they send a tell. Never hear from them otherwise.

We are tired of not being able to enjoy our solo sessions due to "Hey
drood gimme <insert spell here>" in all its many forms and guises. 

We are baffled by people's complete seeming dependency on druids to
play their characters class. Yes I have other chars that are not
druids and NO ONE BOTHERS THEM FOR ANYTHING....hmmmm.... 

And last but not least we ignore you cause we can, you have nothing we
need. We are complete within ourselves and one with the game. Unless
you are a bear, wolf, or another druid we owe you not a dam thing ...
for you role players out there.

Hows that for arrogance?  Let me know if you need more and will be
glad to provide it free of charge.
