Personally I won't help a soul unless they yell for help!! If someone looks
to be in trouble I will stand there and watch and wait for a yell for help.
sad to say but I have watched people die and get bitched at for watching
them die in shouts, to which I simple reply I was standing by to help but
you never asked for help, I am a level 50 Tank not a mind reader thats what
yell is put in the game for. Then the rest of the zone starts ragging on the
fool who died.
