I have, I have posted info on how EQ staff is being cut, money is
going to different teams and that some of the info they are giving you
is for PR only, and numbers are played with so that it looks good.
But whats the point you don't believe me anyway.

Once agian if they have 400K+accounts why make a big deal now over
100K. And why would they ask you to "call up your friends to play" if
so many ae playing. And please don't say to break a record they hit
100k+ before they just never need to tell you . It all PR.

No, some of you came off to me saying as long as "we" play they will
keep EQ on. Sorry, thats not the way they work.

Wrong, the reason he didn't want to see any EQ was the simple fact
that they are not putting all that much money into anymore, thats why.
And for your information 400k back in the day that was true, in the
past 2 years it's gont down to half that. And everytime something
major happens to game, people tend to leave and quite a few have in
this past week or they have stopped play momentarily.

Considering I paoted that weeks before E3  and the PR release and 
people told me I was full of shit. Well, i guess I wasn't.

Sorry, not going to happen. "No more EQ expansions after POP, unless
a drastic change in EQ subscribers manifests itself into profitable
numbers......".

.You should see the Carte Blanc that the SWG team has. The only reason
that "tired bastard" is even tired is because team members have left.
Expect the same kind of support that the Legends guys get on SWG if
not better, we are working with Lucas Arts as far a support and R&D
goes. They have way more people on SWG only and the Power that be are
giving the EQ2 team the same treatment as the SWG team so the don't
lose face. But we here on EQ are making due with what we have, and
it's not much anymore.
