Not a rule. A convention. The first group of people who posted here 
happened to prefer bottom posting so they did... and when more people 
showed up later  they followed the established conventions.

Several ngs top post. But ime bottom posting is preferred most places.

I prefer bottom posting for usenet myself. Particularly since its easier 
to intersperse replies in with original text. In a top post group, 
nobody scrolls down... so they miss any interspersed replies.

Your welcome to your opinion, but it would be appreciated by everyone 
else here if you suck-it-up and conform. :p
