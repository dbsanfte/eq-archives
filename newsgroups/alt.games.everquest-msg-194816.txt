Exp grinding sub 60 in POP, you have a good case for two healers in group, POP was a
saving grace for my poor cleric, who'd been quite marginalized by level 60 shamen.
However, a druid will do admirably as backup to a shaman in a two healer group, you
-still- don't go to cleric as choice one.  With the druid you get DS, Harmo, and quite
admirable nuke DPS, while with a cleric you get... a guy that throws a heal in early in
the fights while you make sure slow sticks, and can't really compete with any other
class during the rest of the fight.  Nothing the druid can't take care of, if you
aren't pushing the envelope.

Now if you are going after mobs that are really hard, sure, the cleric has better
bigger stronger faster heals, in spades.  But the problem with clerics has always been
finding fights that require that much healing.  For exp camps, if you live that close
to the edge you are going to fall off occaisionally, if it happens often enough, the
exp loss after rez plus time to recover from rez will overtake your gains from the
harder target.

POP turned that on its head by featuring really hard fights with enormous exp benefits,
if they hadn't given shaman and druids Incomplete Heals you'd probably never see a
group there without a cleric.  Even as it stands, a cleric has a good shot at a group
anywhere hard.  But a real min/max group may want to stay out of "hard" as inefficient,
at least you'll hear that argued.
