Actually I still think rogues are the poor stepchildren of EQ, though I've
never played one myself. They seem to be useful only for DPS, and are
utterly group-dependant, and groups have other ways to get top-notch DPS,
so....Rogues should have a meaningful special role or function like other
DPS classes do, but the EQ designers have never figured out how to make good
use of the classic D&D "sneaky thief" type class.

I understand that LDoN was supposed to correct that, give rogues a special
usefulness with payoffs that would be more than trivial for groups that
included them, but so far at least that hasn't worked out. My LDoN groups
never seek out rogues -- we can get good DPS from several different classes,
and we basically don't care about either the boxes/crates or the traps.

The melee changes will I assume help rogues by increasing their DPS some
more, but the developers still need to find a way to give rogues a
meaningful second dimension.
