The 40/40 is "Reaver",right ?  =)
There is a hidden damage cap on 2handers which wont be lifted before
level 30 in my experience.

My goal when twinking newly created melee chars is to avoid any 
downtime,I usually start with Soulscream Belt (31%),Iksar BP (5 regen)
and a level appropriate good weapon,other slots I fill with crap,
bringing the char to around 800 hps or so,this is sufficient until one
can start to use the recommened level 45 stuff at the high 30ies.
No need to waste hundreds of k on the 36% haste helm or Funghi tunic
and such.
Usually I loose interest in the (melee)"twinks" at the low
fifties,when leveling gets noticable harder and requires "grinding".
Caster chars get abandoned at the high twenties/low thirties when
it isnt possible any more to tank somewhat efficiently.I hate kiting
with a passion,I realized with a 29 Necro.  =)

>Our challenge comes during the raiding.

I dont know,I never feel "challenged" on raids,either the force is 
strong enough for the given target or it isnt and you fail.

too lazy to list all my "twinks"  =)
