Hiya All,

I hope you don't mind me posting this here but as the servers are down
for 10 hours now seems like a good time to ask your advice.

Yay!  The time has come for me to spend huge wads of cash (well, a
moderate amount anyway) on the annual computer upgrade.  I have started
playing EQ since my last upgrade so compatibility with the current game
and soon(ish) to be released Luclin are my major concern.

I obviously want to minimise my downtime, so when I get the new machine
are there any EQ files I should backup and transfer?  Will I be able to
re-create my account on the new 'puter?  How is this done?

Does anyone know of any problems with this proposed setup and EQ?

Proposed system specs:
----------------------------------

CPU        Athlon 1.2Ghz
RAM       256Mb
HD          ATA 100 20Gb Quantum AS7200
Sound      SB Live (value)
Video      GeForce II GTS 32Mb
Mobo      Asus K7V133
Monitor   17" ADI Trinitron
+ the usual other guff\

OS        Win 98SE

Any help is much appreciated.

Thanks
