You may have experience grouping with good warriors and bad monks. Or 
the warriors are much better twinked. Generally until level 50-52 monk 
will take less absolute damage than a warrior, if they are equipped 
right. Unfortunately, there are more monks that wear stupid stats 
equipment over armor class stuff that there are warriors that do that.
When I say "absolute damage", I mean points of damage, not percentage of 
the health bar visible to group mates

In a competent group there is only one situation where monk's taunting 
will not be enough. That is when you break (intentionally) enthrall on a 
mob. The ways of dealing with that are root and/or stun. 2 rounds of 
combat are enough to keep the mob on tanks instead of enchanter
