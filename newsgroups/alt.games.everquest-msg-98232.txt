And I was sure you were answering because you misread it to say, "Always
hated Bizbee." ;-)

I not only remembered it, but loved it. Later on, one of the best parts
of the great David E. Kelly show, "Picket Fences" was seeing him back
working again as the judge. On one Halloween episode, Kelly showed his
sense of humor by having the judge show up at a costume party wearing a
set of martian antennae for his costume. His only line was, "I feel
rediculous."
