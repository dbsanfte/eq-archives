Complete unknown, people are a funny lot, most of everquest
subscribers came by way of word of mouth in one fashion or other. If
you are a bit angry its less likely that you will recommend the
service. Im of the mind it is considerable but thats just because
pre-luclin I recommended the game to many people of which 6 started
playing and only 2 are left. Since then to no one. Now multiply that
by a crap load of people who have been hit by one bone-headed  move or
another to begin to understand the effect.
