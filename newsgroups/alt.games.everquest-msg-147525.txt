This group will do well In Pit, North and West wings. South and East would
pose problems.

First thing to know are that there are mobs in there called Sepulchre
Skeletons. These are SKs and HT like a bitch. HT is from 500hps up to 700hps

When you zone in you are on a platform with 4 stairways to 4 doors. These
are the wings, North, West, South and East in order of difficulty. The
stairs to East are a trap and you will fall through.

There are two roamers when you zone in. Kill these and then set up. The mob
you are first looking for are the devourer mobs, look like tadpoles with
teeth. These will drop a No rent item called a tallowed candle. This is the
key to the North wing door. If not one of the roamers then all lev, go north
and drop down to pit area. The area below is free mostly from wanderers.
Pull and kill mobs until you get a key. Once you have a key all run into the
blue portal in the centre and you will warp back to zone in.

Clear the two north golems and go in through door.

Each wing start follows the same pattern. Through the door there are 4 mobs
to clear. Once done ahead of you are some steps leading to a picture of
venril Sathir. This is an illusion wall and you can travel through and drop
down a little on other side. Be prepared for a fight here as there are
static's and wanderers.

Once in you can fight your way into North. At bottom of first ramp on left
is a small rug, this is a pit trap , do not step on it. You are now in a
Square with various rooms. The centre room has 4 mobs and on the floor is a
small bag. This is the key that unlocks the last door. You need from here
the named who drops the key to West wing. Keep killing and clearing and he
will eventually spawn.

Will let you discover west on your own.

BTW this zone destroys all faction with OT outpost.
