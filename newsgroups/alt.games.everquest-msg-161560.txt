Karnors was/is just an all-round noob zone.  Your IQ drops to 1 digit simply
for reading the public chat banter in there.

Trains, ksing, arguing, whining, basically a LoiO zone of players confined
in a dungeon.

Velk is similar in the ksing whines in ooc, but its an easy zone to dominate
and make awesome exp.

When AA first came out w/Luclin, me and a guildie rogue setup in our own
camp spot, as sad as it sounds :p we would time pops, and always be there
ready and waiting for them.

For something like 6 hours constant, we easily killed 95% of the spiders
that spawned on and around the ramps (bottom level, up the ramps, the small
golems, eyes/above ff).. that was before exp-burnout, and we easily made 3-6
AA's in an evening
