I might suggest looking for a guild that uses Team speak, something
that uses voice over internet ( Like Ventrilo) this would cut down on
the ammount of typing he has to do(unless you want him to learn to type
better)

Teamspeak often speeds up the gameplay, and in situations where you
need to give out complex directions in a hurry, it makes it much
easier.

You can still type most of your chat if you want to, but I know it's
sometimes hard to type in "HEY, I'm Getting Hit here!!" while you are
running for your life.
