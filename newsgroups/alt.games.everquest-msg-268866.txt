Sure, but you're still doing it for *your* satisfaction aren't you? The
team gains nothing by that Super Bowl or World Series victory parade.
They've already got their rings and the sense of satisfaction from winning.
The kid is in Harvard - there's his satisfaction. I think you're confusing
it with adulation. I don't personally have a problem with pep rallies or
with being a fan. But is your *guild* more appreciated by your hard work
*for* them or for simply wearing a tag. Read what I'm saying, there's no
hidden agenda or mincing of words. My opinion is that simply displaying a
tag does not inherently equate to "guild pride".

It isn't hard for me to understand at all. I never said anything about
selfishness. Personal satisfaction, yes, but nothing of selfishness.
Selfishness is wearing a guild tag simply to wear it and do *nothing* to
better your guild.
