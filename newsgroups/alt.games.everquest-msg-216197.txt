There's only so much they can do with the old engine. They hit
ceilings. To go farther, they'd have to replace the engine itself,
and, at that point, they may as well create a whole new game. It's not
like EQ will be dumped the moment EQ2 comes out. As long as there are
still enough paying players to justify it, they'll continue developing
EQ.
