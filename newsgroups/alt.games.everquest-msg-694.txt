It is enabled, however I wouldn't call it a mainstay combat wise. It is best
used for pulling the MOB to you, or stepping back to get a few hits in. The
reason I wouldnt call it a mainstay is the cost prohibitive nature of having
to fletch your arrows. Maybe when your char. is more mature, and cost isnt
so much of an issue, but I doubt it even then.
