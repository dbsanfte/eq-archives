Absor doesn't even know the durn game =p he is a moron. if a game didn't
work out the way you wanted it to, what you do is TRY to make the changes
interact with the players, poll people. Maybe it wasn't his original idea
starting, but I would say anyone's first idea on how a game should/will be
played is probably wrong. Heh just another rant by me =p
