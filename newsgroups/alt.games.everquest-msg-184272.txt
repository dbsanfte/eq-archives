Bull#$%

You want to see destroyed lives, talk to women who have been married
to drug and alcohol abusers. Visit a shelter for battered women
sometime. The lives of these so called EQ-Widows aren't "destroyed" by
any stretch of the imagination.

Husbands (or even wives) spending too much time at work, with the
"guys", on a hobby, etc, etc  is a universal marriage problem. The
root cause is generally disastifaction with the marriage that leads
the individual to seek escapism. EQ is just one of the many ways this
problem manifests itself.

EQ may be a symptom, but it is NOT the root cause of the problem.
