Just remember that newbies are often compelled to take the easy
path when they'd end up having much more fun taking the hard
path.  The books encourage the easy path *too* much.  Most newbies
can't say no.  They might not even *know* that they should say no.

Sometimes you have to FORCE people to have fun, as odd as that may
sound...
