I don't recall ever seeing that confirmation.  The only thing
I've ever seen cited was from the correspondence posted after
the Conquest / Sleeper's Tomb mess, where the SOE reps didn't
responsd to a passing statement along the lines of "everybody
knows about aggro decay" and that silence was assumed to be a
tacit acknowledgement.

Even so, SOE reps have made plenty of incorrect statements
about game mechanics (your point, I guess).
