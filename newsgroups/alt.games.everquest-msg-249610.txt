My first character on EMarr was my dwarven paladin.  I took a look at my 
cloth map that came with EQ, and decided I should go visit the exotic 
Karanas, and maybe even Qeynos.  I found the boat, got to Freeport, and 
using nothing but my cloth map to guide me, tried to get there.  
Eventually I gave up, as that cloth map was a worthless piece of crap.  I 
went back to the boat in Freeport, and found out that dwarves are too 
short to just run up onto the boat, instead, they fall into the water.  I 
drowned, not yet knowing how to swim in the game.  Read up in the manual 
how to swim, took the boat back to Freeport, looted my corpse under water 
(I didn't know about dragging yet), coming up for air a couple of times, 
took the boat back home, and stayed closer to home for some time.

Later I created my shaman, when he was level 9, I needed to get a couple 
of spells from the gypsy camp in Oasis.  So off I went, confident in the 
knowledge that with SoW I could outrun any mobs that attacked me.  I made 
it to North Karana before I got slaughtered by a Griffawn.  Made the run 
again, looted up, watching all the while for hostile mobs, and managed to 
run all the way to Oasis.  I bound in Freeport on the way, to be safe, 
and so, had to run all the way back.  That was when I discovered that 
Highland Lions run at faster than level 9 sow speed.  Run back from 
Freeport, loot up, and make it back home.

It was quite the adventure, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, depsite the 
deaths.
