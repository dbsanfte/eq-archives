well it's not much better in the UK, I'm a daytime player and this is
right in the middle of my play time, everytime.

It's likely positioned to keep the majority of US evening players
happy......or is that just too logical to even be close?

I'm not familiar with the maitainance of MMorpg servers, but why can
they not have a test patch server where they apply all changes and
then simply swap drives with all patch data pre-installed?

It could even be done in groups of maybe 10 servers at any one time,
so as NOT to interrupt all EQ players

maybe I missed something?
