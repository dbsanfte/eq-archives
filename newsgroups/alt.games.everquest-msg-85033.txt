They're all free.  They're all also dropped (or the quest components
dropped) from 50+ mobs surrounded by other 50+ mobs.  Free != easy.

The Bracer of Hammerfall quest is a decent lower level alternative to the
shuriken bracers, though it's still a moderately difficult quest simply due
to the zones you have to travel through.  A druid/wiz helps lower that
difficulty considerably.
