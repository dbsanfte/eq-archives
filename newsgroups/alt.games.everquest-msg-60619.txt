You do have a decent set up, so if it's not a bad piece of hardware I'd
probably tell you what tech support has probably already told
you...reinstall the latest version of DirectX then the latest versions of
your video & sound drivers.  Of course, you should do a Thorough File Check
from the EQ patch window but that's probably not it.

If that doesn't work...hmmm, when's the last time you formatted & started
from scratch?  That's usually how I find & fix annoying problems that I
realize will probably take longer than a format c: /s /u will take. :)
