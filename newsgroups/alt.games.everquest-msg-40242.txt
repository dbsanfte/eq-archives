Most likely, you're not yet at the level where you gain the
ability to use such special attacks, and thus you can't practice
them yet either.

Go to your guild trainer and look at the "skills" list, it'll show
you at what level you get which types of attacks.  Once you reach
that level, put at least one practice point into that skill to
gain the ability to use it.  Then you'll find that that skill
has appeared on your "combat" menu list.
