Well PXK is significantly harder than the next set of named in Tacvi... so
it seems quite odd they would kill miss cockblock, and then not benefit from
the rewards it opens up.  The day after we killed PXK we engaged the
southern snake, and on our first ever engage, got it to 28%. Thats with no
spoilers, not even a single hint or tip.

They shouldn't be in Tacvi if they didn't kill Zun (assuming they've had
fair shots on zun), cuz thats just gimp.  But killing Pxt with 54 is
definately a bigger achievement than killing Zun (i assume they used about
70 too?)

On our last zun kill, we only had 1 death (the rampage ranger!), and im very
confident its at 100% farm status already.  Our rivals wiped on it on
Saturday (after a clean first fill the previous spawn) so i won't get too
complacent, but it really does seem a pretty hard event to fail after the
first kill.

Why not?

Lol Primals... thats one mob ive resisted leading a raid on upto now.  Even
before we beat Uqua, the loot was shite. Now, id expect it to rot or go to
apps.  Very strange logic there, why would they take Yx over tacvi/tx?
I take it the next day you guys went and killed Zun right?

Txevu is really shit risk v reward, for the time you need to invest just to
get 2 pieces of ok loot, or 1 dumb aug/weapon.

Sounds very amaturish... some people feeling the burn or sting from GoD /
rivals killing pixt?

You can pin it so clerics arent in AE range, and still have its ass to poke
at =/  Was that tattle btw? We call our guildie ranger with his headware
"the hat" (aka ACM's hat).  What a fucking attrocious graphic, I wonder if
as more people break into Txevu, they will reconsider its image =)

Nope not range issues, and cheal was rolling. It did a flurry at the very
start which just 1 rounded our third best warrior (over 10.5k hp unbuffed)
The same warrior was first tank on our win, and successfully tanked it for
110% of its life too!

I don't think the encounter has changed a single bit. The only update was a
loot audit, and a fix to the zone crash problem.
The first time we got to the adds part (i.e knew they existed as a mob
ability) (after the initial shock of seeing them + wipe) we killed one, and
it just insta repopped! So we were like "hmmm... this is gonna suck!"

Log on some more =p and not so late!
