I'm glad you have this policy, I wish the other officers of Stormrunners 
had this policy to begin with. There were too many bad players recruited 
into the guild en masse who had the "the guild owes me" attitude with 
all the PL begging, port begging, items begging, character transfer 
begging etc and all with no appreciation after they got it. They 
destroyed the guild atmosphere.

I wouldn't say most good players who want to join a guild have already 
done so by their early 20's. There are a lot of experienced players who 
would rather not join a guild until they are of a high enough level to 
join a high level guild.

A good way to weed out the less obvious idiots is to have a look at who 
you think has the "the guild owes me" attitude rather than the "what can 
I do for the guild?" attitude.
