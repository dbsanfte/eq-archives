I wasn't being emotional, I was being informative.   I was informing you of
the fact you are an idiot.  As well as the fact that I am not going to be
distracted by your bullshit.  My language is irrelevant to the debate at hand.
We were debating the use of the word pussy, not the use of the word lame.   If
you really wish to change the subject to whether "lame" is offensive or not,
then I'll just leave you here to type to yourself, as the new subject does not
interest me, and the question is irrelevant to the old subject.
