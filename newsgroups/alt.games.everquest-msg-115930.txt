In my experience, haven't ever seen this example happen. Heh, even on
Halloween, the sheer numbers of werewolves in WC made short work of anyone
who was level appropriate in the zone, even chased me out (as a 40th or so
druid). And they weren't level limited, anyone could kill them.

If this is true, it would be a good thing.
