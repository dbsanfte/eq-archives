One day, we finally decided to hit level 2.  Had fun down there, killed 
Lumpy a few times, but no monk weapon.  Never got any good loot items on 
level 2, but still had a blast.

A couple days later, we said "what the hell" and hit level 3.  We had 2 
monks with us that day ( one is in our regular group, now ) and we ended up 
looting 3 pieces of the monk armor from dead Kly.  Good day for them!

We took out the whole level ( I played my chanter that day for safety ) 
until we got to the Kly room.  Early in the level 3 push, we got to the big 
room, medded and healed up and Ughhies announced one of his "tough" pulls.

I hadn't used AOE Mez in at least 10 levels.  I'm glad I memmed it that 
day.  Everyone in the group made some sort of remark when my first one took 
on every single Kly - "omg!"  "holy shit"  "wow!".  Seeing the mezzed 
message 8 or so times on my screen at once was pretty amazing.  I was 
probably more stunned than the Kly, as I never put much faith in that spell 
because of the way it used to get me killed.

I hated leaving Dalnirs, but it started to get Cyan on us.  I'm hating that 
we are leaving Kaesora, but it's for the same reason.  And, we've pretty 
much looted everything you can without going to the 5 towers, except we 
haven't gotten the bard sword =(  We got 2 Daggers of Frost from the 
Runelord, but no sword.

We got the 1hb staff that procs some sort of Lifedraw last night, so 
Ughhies used it for a while just for the shit of it.  My Rogue is going to 
enjoy that Cryptrobber's knife that will replace his Tombcarver.

Kaesora was nice because we actually end up using the loot we get.  We're 
letting those +6int +6wis books rot because we all have one and have even 
passed some off to alts.  Same with the 25% reduction backpacks.  The bard 
is wearing some of the mail that has dropped, the shaman has a book and is 
wearing the mantle, heck, my 40 War is wearing that mantle, as it had 1 
more AC than the banded I had.

Dungeon fun.  Can't beat it.
