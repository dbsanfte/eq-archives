Or you just have some kinda persecution complex? Like the guys who get
pulled over for speeding and bitch at the cops for not going after the
"real criminals"?

3. Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin (e.g.
Jesus, Allah, Satan, Stalin).

Takes 'em all of 2 minutes to change someone's name, usually less.
Sometimes more if the player decides to argue over it, in which case,
it's the player's fault for taking up more of the gm's time.

Because no one reported the names until now? They don't go through
everyone's account every day to see if all the names are ok... There
are characters who never see a guide/gm until well after they've hit
60. In most cases, bad names are only caught because they're reported
by a player.
