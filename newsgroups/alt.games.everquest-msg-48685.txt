Quests?

My character is a human warrior, I figured he'd be the easiest to play.  I
could be wrong but I figured it couldn't hurt to start there.  I did manage
to collect some items, a few ruined pelts and some bone chips.  Guess I'll
hang on to the bone chips and see if I can auction them off later.

I'll have to look up this quests thing though.  None of the NPCs really have
much to say to me other than "what would I like on my tombstone" or trying
to sell me stuff that I don't know what it does yet.

And yes, I did find the bank so I have managed to save a bunch of stuff
now...btw, what do spiderling legs do?

Thanks for all the help from this still *newbie*.
