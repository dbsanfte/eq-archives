This is what I did to fix the issue;

1) Deleted my EQclient.ini file.
2) this caused my graphics settings to revert to the default.
3) I then set the resolution to match my windows client (in this case I ran
at a resolution of 1280 x 1024) for both windows and EQ.  That seems to be
working wit the rest of the bells attached

Hiope that helps someone else too,

Geoff
