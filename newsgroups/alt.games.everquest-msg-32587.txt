    Yes, but look at YOUR complaint: "...the next time a tank dies to a mob
just before it dies...." You imply that the cleric has gone OOM, since
otherwise the tank is healed. But that isn't true in a constant-pull
situation, at a Pinzarn level - the heal is better than the Symbol.

>My only point:  not carrying components strictly because of the

    Agreed. But I understand why he's doing it.

    Not always possible. Even in the mid-50's I've grouped with people who
think part of a cleric's job is paying for them to turbo-loot every mob that
hits the ground. And they know when to do it, too - what the "cherry" mobs
are, if they have to back off looting, and if there's few people in zone
that could replace them to go full bore. Sadly, these usually end up being
the people best-equipped, and thus most likely to get a new pickup group.

    "I'm poor. I can't afford the gems. Thank Brell I never have to pay for
a res."

    Because his way is a fait accompli. I don't want to bear the cost of
symbols - if I don't bring them gems, problem solved. I CANNOT be made to
bear costs now. If I rely on a tank's word, they can always start
turbo-looting as soon as the symbol lands. And the cleric gets screwed
again. Trust me - unless you get paid up front, you ain't getting paid.

    Better for who - the tank, or the cleric?

    It CAN make it worse on them. Then the tanks start REALLY lootwhoring,
to make up for the "losses" when they hand over cash/cash items to the
cleric.

    Heh. Why would you avoid him, unless you didn't want to pay your way?
I'm a cleric. I have a stack of Pearls on me for CotH, I have some portal
fragments for a translocate (and to avoid excuses from wizards), and if I
had space I'd carry a coffin, too. And if a coffin IS required for anyone
you better believe I fork over some peridots, if I don't have cash loot to
help cover costs. If *I* can be aware of what others go through, why can't a
tank? Even my 35 WAR saves up jaspers and bloodstones from soloing to give
to party clerics.

    Yes, so he'd better get his point across NOW before these folks become
totally set in their ways.

    I carry 160 Peridots, standard. You know what side of the "carry or not
carry" debate I'm on. But I applaud anyone who's tired of being dicked
around by random Joe after random Joe that thinks that one class in
particular should pay for the honour of being in a group, or on a raid.
