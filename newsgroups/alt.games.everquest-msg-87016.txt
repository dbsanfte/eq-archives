	It is at most 10% haste, and may be as low as 5%.  Measuring haste is a
little complicated.  You need to go someplace reasonably safe, like EC, target
a merchant, then run across the zone keeping the merchant targetted.  Then
turn on autoattack.  While you are out of range you will get the 'can't hit
them' message for every attack, including all possible Dual Wield and Double
Attacks.  Let it run for at least two minutes, with the haste item on for one
run and off for another.  Count the attacks.

	Every time a new haste item enters the game, the hucksters try to pass it
off as being at least FBSS speed.  If the item came off a spawn or quest that
is easier than killing the Frenzied Ghoul, they're lying.  The FRSS came off a
punk 30-ish mob in TD that spawned every four minutes, for the 24 hours before
it was yanked.  Even before it was parsed savvy players knew it would be at
most a 10% haste.
