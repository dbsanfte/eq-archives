Go find a Merchant and buy something sharp an pointy. Find a monster
wandering around with nothing to do. Stick the sharp pointy thing into the
monster numerous times. Hope that he does not have something sharp and
pointy to stick you back with. If the beasties red health bar goes down
faster than yours this is a bonus. Beasties goes by by from you sticking it
and you get EXP! WOO HOO Ding!
