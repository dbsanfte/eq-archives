Actually I'm pretty sure they said low one would be about jboots. You
are paying for the graphic.

That is pretty much a no I'd say. No idea but I bet the fastest does
not even equal a level 50 sow. Verant has always had this thing about
not stepping on the toes of what a class can do with an item, no
matter how much the item costs. Jboots does not really since as people
say it equals level 9 sow. You can bet that the first horse therefore
will be about that speed .. next might be higher (If I remember right
the first noticeable upgrade in sow speed for me was level 19) and
highest maybe the mid levels. Selo's is pretty much a no way, since
then you are stepping on bard's toes.

And I'm betting for a high level char sow is still much faster.

I kind of agree. Its not that my 55 level character could not scrounge
for a couple weeks to get 15 k, its that if I did I would not want to
spend it on a gimmick. Its not so much that people could NOT come up
with the money for it but how many would feel it was worth 15 k?

Yeah, but if you figure for 15k you can get a decent item its worth it
to do so instead of a gimmick horse that is probably not much faster
than jboots and no where near as fast as sow or selo's. Again, this
taking of a particular spell to that degree from a class is just not
something that Verant does and something that they have in fact said
time and time again they DON'T do. Its why even for 15 k you can't buy
an item to give you clarity and its why tboots are like 5 k and only
level 9 sow speed. For a character with alteration skill like an sk
they are faster if they buy sow potions than use tboots or jboots ;)

This is moot until they are in game or they announce the speed, but
you are paying for the horsey look and if the 9 k one is jboots speed
the 15 k one is going to be a bit faster but certainly not much.
