You don't need to have had multi-group experience, the rules are the same as
a single-group, especially for a monk.  Assist the main tank.

Those who think that those who haven't gone on multi-group raids are n00bs
really need to get their head out of their ass.  They aren't any big deal.
The healers keep their group alive.  Their tanks tank.  Their shamans buff
(multi-group only, a particular shaman will be designated slower).  Their
wizards nuke.  Their enchanters buff, nuke, and mez (multi-group -
particular enchanters are in charge of mezzing and/or tashing).  Necros deal
damage if they can, mana feed healers if they can't.

Big whoop.

But yeah, they can be fun if you can get used to the fact that no raid will
take place a minimum of an hour late unless you're in a Raid Guild...and
even then, it's PROBABLY 30 minutes (that part's a guess...I have no
interest in joining a Raid Guild).  There's a lot of sitting on your hands
waiting for things to start.  Bring a book or play that game (I forget what
it's called....Stones?  The Tetris thing) to kill time.
