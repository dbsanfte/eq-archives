Ugh...dial up? Well, you may want to either rethink the free trial or 
find someone that has broadband and have them download the file and burn 
it to CD for you. You're looking at a 1.6 gig download. There is an 
option to download the files in 200 meg chunks. Those can be burned to a 
CD (the single 1.6g file would be too big for a cd).

If no one has broadband, then you'll have to either get the station 
account info from your friend or just wait and buy the platinum version 
for $30. If you don't want to commit to the $30, you could always look 
around in various stores for the Trilogy (game and first 2 expansions). 
You should be able to pick that up for cheap (~$10). Just be sure it 
isn't used! I see video game stores selling used copies of MMORPGs all 
the time and it's generally a ripoff because of this type of problem. 
Not to mention you won't get the free month!
