Agreed, but keeping only one wep skill capped is not a very good idea in
my opinion. I strive to keep at least 4 capped. You never know when a
great wep will come your way, and I'd hate to try dk blue mobs at lvl
40+ with a wep skill under 10 lol! I speak from experience as I happened
by Shady one evening and purchased a Fungus Covered Tarmok Staff (30DMG,
40DLY) for 6pp, that's correct only 6! Getting my 2HB skill up to take
advantage of this find has been somewhat of a chore starting at level
25. Much better that I had started earlier like I am doing with my newer
chars. Live and learn!
