Whether dial up or cable modem, for some reason EQ will just drop the
connection.  I hate it when it does it while I'm running.  Have come back in
interesting places, when I've lived that is.  I also use a Linksys router
and play several online games and EQ is the only one that will drop the
connection routinely.  I know this doesn't help, just my 2cp worth.
