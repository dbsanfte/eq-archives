While I enjoy a "high on life" perspective, I actually agree with most
of these comments.

Video games are one of the biggest, most colossal wastes of time one
can imagine.
They suck you in, drain your productivity, isolate you, and even make
some folks lethargic and irresponsive to outside stimuli.

Of course, this is also true of golf.

Also true for "for fun" music bands.

Also true for wanna-be artists.

Also true for websurfing.

Also true for people who shop.

etc., etc., etc...

Point is... video games are recreation like all the rest. They're a
break from the productivity of daily life.
Anything done out of moderation is wasteful. However, played in
moderation, video games are fun.

Something which drugs have a habit of taking from people's lives.

Peace to you, bro.
