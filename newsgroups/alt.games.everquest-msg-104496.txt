And annoy about 1 million others.  I've gotten used to the first person view
in EQ, but that's only because it's so addictive.  OTOH, 1st person is what
turned me off to Bard's Tale (for those who remember it).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
