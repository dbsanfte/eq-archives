I thank Tunare every day that there are enchanters willing to do this.  My
ranger is level 52, my druid is 40.  I donate between 50 and 100 plat for each
KEI on Tholuxe Paells.  If I don't have that much I wait, because *I* would be
embarrassed otherwise.
You pay whatever you think is fair.  *A Donation* is exactly that.  To each his
own.
(FWIW, my druid never thought 10 plat per port was a worthy money making
venture.  And there were a LOT of people that were "put off" by my lack of
desire to take them to Iceclad or some Tunare Forsaken Hell Hole for "a
donation").
