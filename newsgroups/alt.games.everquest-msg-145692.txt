A natural consequence of the mechanics of the pickpocket skill and
human nature.  Clearly you haven't had experiences like:
1) Spending hours grouped at a normally "ok" for pp camp that seemed to
be producing about half the usual coinage, not attaching any special
significance to the Rogue complaining all day and running off to zone
and return so she can reset her hotkeys... and two days later you
learn that Pickpocket skill has a bug that locks hotkeys.
(I heard that they fixed this bug, which is yet another reason to
not group with a_random_rogue_XX, now you can't even spot the extra
greedy ones to boot them from the group.)
2) Your young Ranger has finally caught the Orc Runner and he's gonna
just barely manage to win the fight.  Some dirtbag of a Barbarian runs
up and stops for a second... you finish the fight, no quest bit on the
corpse (this item never fails to drop, btw).
3) Half your group dies because the Rogue is too damned busy bragging
about his highest BS result to some passing fellow twink to join the
melee.

These are not isolated incidents, but rather typical of my experiences
with 'random' Rogues.  It's because of shit like that that I quit
grouping with Rogues not already known to myself/friend/guildmate about
2 years ago, and frankly I haven't missed them a bit.  Too damned many
of the a_random_rogue_XX's are dirtbags, the odds of finding a decent
one in the LFG set are too poor to make it worthwhile.
