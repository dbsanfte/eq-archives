I happened to be looking for quests in Erudin Palace
yesterday and got instructions to retrieve the heretic
bones from the jail. All I knew was that it was
"in the basement" and, in all the time I'd spent there,
I'd never seen a basement in the palace.

I happened to be passing a guard and on a lark I
asked him "Where is the jail?". To my surprise, he
told me exactly were it was! It was a bit of a treat
considering I'd expected to get a blank look from him.

Anyone else gotten unexpected responses when you
randomly spoke to an NPC?
