The other day we were in LOIO.  As we zoned in from FV there was a guy there,
naked, getting beat up by a goblin.  He wasn't fighting back and didn't respond
to /tell.  We were able to kill the goblin but not before he died.  He popped
back up right there - still naked.  Still not responding.  An hour later he was
still standing there naked.  Figured he must be bound there.  
Could the GM disconnect someone who obviously is AFK?
