Mildly entertaining. The "Star Wars" science fiction style universe is
just too close to the real world to really pull me in. I loved the
movies and Star Wars was a HUGE part of my childhood, but I just can't
get all that excited about SWG.

>Do you think it'll be below average/disappointing/boring/completely worthless?  Why?

There is *NO* way it will live up to the hype and expectations of the
fans.

>"It's gonna suck because the only way to be Jedi is gonna be to buy a Jedi char!" or "It's gonna suck
>because <insert any other of the many incorrect and misinformed objections

The fatal flaw in SWG as I see it is this....Everyone will want to be
a Jedi. 

In a fantasy game like EQ, this isn't an iussue. None of the classes
in EQ are "the" class to be. Thousands of people didn't buy EQ just to
play a Bard (or any other class). The magic of EQ is that classes are
balanced (for the most part), and every player can play the class that
they enjou the most. In SWG "Jedi" will be the one goal of 80-90% of
the player base, and most likely the main reason most people buy the
game. 

Playing alongside hundreds or thousands of other wanna-be Jedi's is
just going to be a bit silly. If becoming a Jedi is as hard as they
say, then people will lose interest. If selling "Jedi" accounts
becomes rampant then no one will respect the "class".

>(1)  It's not random.  There is no element of randomness to selection.

Then it can be "farmed"

>(2)  Anyone can be a Jedi.

Then becoming a Jedi must not matter that much in-game (ie Jedi powers
will not be very useful). Encounters will have to be tuned to be
doable by non-Jedi's. Unlike the movie universe where Jedi powers make
characters "super-human". If being a Jedi gives players a significant
advantage over non-jedi's, then things will go downhill very fast.
People aren't going to pay to play a game of "haves" and "have nots"
when they are stuck being the "have nots". If you think EQ has/had
class-balancing issues just wait for SWG....<shudder>

>(3)  SOE will not hand-pick them.

Then it can be "farmed"

>(4)  They will not be sold.

Sure...just like EQ accounts/items/pp are never sold now...right.....

>(5)  It will be very, very, very hard to become a Jedi -- but anyone can
>become one at any level in their character's development (there is no

>skilled/powerful at what you do).

If it is too hard, people (who bought the game to be a Jedi) will quit
in disgust. If it is doable for the average player, Jedi's will be a
dime-a-dozen. Catch-22

>(6)  The process that one player uses to become Jedi will not work for any
>other player, so it's pointless to solve it and then post on Allakhazam.
>Nobody else will be able to use your solution.

Bull#$%^....10s OF THOUSANDS of people will play SWG. How many
"unique" paths do you think they will be able to come up with? If it
is a quest system that allows a certain "quest" to only be completed
once (ala Sleepers Tomb in EQ), then the the odds are a process or
pattern will be discovered, and then quickly farmed. Never
underestimate the power of the player base to "grind" out a solution.

>(7)  SOE will not impose any kind of cap on the number of Jedi -- that
>number will be limited only by the extreme difficulty in becoming one.

Great, so only 24/7 no-life's get to be Jedi's? Nice. I wonder how
long the "average" or casual player will stick around when being a
Jedi is the #1 reason they purchased the game in the first place?

>Like I said, I'm gonna be a Jedi :)

See "fatal flaw" above.
