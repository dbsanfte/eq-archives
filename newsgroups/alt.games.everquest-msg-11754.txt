Don't forget if you pick a dorf, to get Agility to 75,  I grouped at 19
with a Dorf who had almost 150 HP less than me,  Wearing plate(pal or
war)  I'm a ranger, I dropped kitty feet(AGI buff) on him, and he got
ahead of me.  The AC penalty for under 75 is severe, and you are a
tank.  AC is king

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
