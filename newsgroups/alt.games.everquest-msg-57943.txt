Yep, what he said. It would not matter if the monk was in the 40s
because if the person was low enough level the monks bandage will heal
them up well anyway since they have low HP. You can't bandage when the
person is AT 50 percent, but you can at 49 percent and below and the
hp they get back never stops at 50 percent.
