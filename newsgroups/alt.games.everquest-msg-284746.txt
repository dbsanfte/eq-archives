I would agree with that. I was just trying to clarify. MT yells "assist me 
now", MA assists him and *then* everyone assists the MA, right? It would 
seem to me that the protocol should involve the MA hitting his assist 
hotkey immediately upon assist being called while everyone else kind of 
plays it by feel, hitting theirs a couple of seconds after, assisting the 
MA at that point.
