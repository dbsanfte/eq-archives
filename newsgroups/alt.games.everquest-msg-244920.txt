Interesting concept. I've always wondered about the viability of a 
casual server... one that didn't allow you to play more than X hours a 
month.

(If you found you were bumping into X... you char-xfer (for FREE dammit) 
to the X+Y server, or 'an unlimited play' server. Once you xfer "up"... 
you can't go back... or if they have friends they don't want to leave... 
create an alt on another server...)

The appeal... these 'casual' servers would have a much lower and slower 
'high end game'... in theory someone who played only 10-15 hours a week 
could be at the top end game for the server, without falling behind. I 
think there would be people interested in playing on a server where 
every AA they earned didn't mean they were now 10AA further behind the 
top end game. Being at the top of a server is fun... but currently its 
reserved exclusively for people who have and are willing to dedicate 
copious amounts of time.

Technically, I think I've got a bag and a staff that were effectively 
purchased with RL cash... since there was no in-game way to get them. =)
Fortunately SOE has staved off the big accusations by making the items 
relatively worthless.

Heh... well... that would be enough to get me to quit on principle. :)
