I'm with you.  I played thru all the hardships, and I really dont care if
anyone else has to.  I play to have a good time and meet fun people, not to
get screenshots to frame for my den.  Seems like the real babies are the
jealous supergamers who wanna throw a tantrum if anyone else has it easier
than them.  I wish they'd drop the price of "legends" so some of these folks
would just go play by themselves!  ;)
