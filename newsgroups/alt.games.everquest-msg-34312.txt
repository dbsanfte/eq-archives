People do recognize it often enough, but hardly for the right reasons.  If I
hear "Wow, so you play Final Fantasy Tactics too?" one more time . . .

Heh, thanks. ;)  I tend to avoid petitioning legitimate literary references
myself, but have been known to petition what I consider to be offensive
names.  (One I was shocked to see level himself to 50+ without losing his
name was Terda Pokinout . . . I never did petition that one, but often
considered it.)  I wonder if they ever got around to changing "Jesus" and
"Jahova" on Vazaelle . . .
