It's called "avoiding conflicts of interest".  Maybe it's different 
on your server, but on Povar there are MANY guilds and guild alliances
capable of doing the Planes (my guild is one of them), Venril Sathir, 
Trakanon, other highly-contested mobs and high level dungeons.  You do 
a search on my guild on given night lately, and many of us are likely 
to be in the Arena area of Kael or deep inside Dragon Necropolis.  
These are not places you bring non-planar level people.  These are our 
favorite hunting grounds, but often times we've been beaten to that 
part of the dungeon by another guild and have had to move on.  With 
our high population of level 50+ characters on the server, it's not 
that surprising that many people have 2 or more level 50+ characters.  
With all the competion for spawns and favored hunting spots, can you 
IMAGINE what some less-scrupulous people might do if they had characters 
in two or more of these guilds?  Guild relations at the planar level are 
tense enough as it is!

My guild's policy is hardly unique on the server.  /shrug  And no one 
said you had to join us.  Quite frankly, I'm happy where I am, or I 
wouldn't have joined in the first place.  The "one guild" rule makes
sense on my server, and it's a price I'm willing to play for being
a member in one of the most honorable and trusted guilds on Povar.
