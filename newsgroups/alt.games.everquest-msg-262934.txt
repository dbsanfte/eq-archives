You can (and as far as I know always have been able to) get green
drops if you are in a raid. (Even a two person raid where the other
one is in the bazaar.)

The thing is that small barrier, while It's not difficult to overcome
if you need a quest drop, tends to put a damper on people just
outright farming.

Strangely all of the stuff for the shaman 1.0 epic is no drop but not
lore or magic, so it does not get travailed, but the stuff for the
cleric 1.0 epic is all droppable and does get travailed.
