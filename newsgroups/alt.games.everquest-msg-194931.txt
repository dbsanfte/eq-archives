Drops in Velks, and is no drop, so you'll have to loot it yourself.

If you're doing the Thurg Shawl quests, you are looking at 75 of the things
minimum, IIRC, so it isn't an entirely trivial operation.  Still, if you are
too low level to hunt in Velks and don't mind scrounging, there's a good chance
you can arrange to loot off spiders others are killing; many people don't
bother doing that quest, or already have their 75 threads, yet hunt in VL for
the exp or the velium or in some areas for other drops.  Place used to be jam
packed with people doing exp work, but POP has killed much of that.
