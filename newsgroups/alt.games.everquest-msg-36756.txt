Except for the ebayer who asked me "is there any way to translocate myself?"

I replied "no."

Yes.  It has never happened to me, but it has happened to people I know.  If
my evac key is [5] my gate key is [6]... party leaves I'm still there... I
become the devil ([6] [6] [6])

Well actually it's more like 66666666666666666666
6666666666666666666666666666666666666666

I have never left anyone behind on a regular port unless they were out of
range... except for one really weird bug where we were standing on docks...
but I think I was registered as being under water, and he wasn't (even
though I wasn't either)... or he might have been on the boat (right next to
me) and I on the docks when the spell went off.

However I HAVE absolutely left people behind on evacs.  In fact both times
it was the same person... my Druid pet (not exactly a person who is helpless
if left behind on a port... but still, someone I've hunted with ALOT... and
it's kinda funny that she'd get left behind).  One of those times I could
see that maybe she might have been out of range (though I REALLY doubt
it)... but the other if she'd been any closer, I'd have been... well let's
just say she was definitely in range of the spell.

I actually use my (err... Shock of Thunder?... the 29 one with knock back)
spell as a "summon mob" spell on occassion when I want to yank it off the
cleric... it is VERY funny sometimes... but I definitely have to tank for a
round when I do it.

(Target the mob, turn so you're facing directly away, and cast... make sure
you bellow "COME HERE, %t!  GET OVER HERE!" ... and it will [assuming it
doesn't resist]).

True, but that's about the time you should be forgetting about you melee
skills.
