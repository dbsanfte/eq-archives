Classes need their own theme songs. My humble suggestions....



Bard: "Play that Funky Music", Wild Cherry
Beastlord: "Eye of the Tiger", White Snake
Berzerker: "I am a Viking", Yngwie Malmsteen
Cleric: "Alive", Edwin
Druid: "Orinoco Flow", Enya
Enchanter: "Tubthumpin", Chumbawumba
Monk: "Kung Fu Fighting", ???
Necromancer: "Pressure", Billy Joel
Paladin: "The Hero", Mike Oldfield
Ranger: "Knocking on Heaven's Door", Led Zeppelin
Rogue: "Little Willy Won't Go", Bay City Rollers
Shadowknight: "Bad to the Bone", George Thorogood
Warrior: "Take this Job and Shove It", Johnny Paycheck
Wizard: "Bring It On", Kottonmouth Kings

Couldn't think of any for magician or shaman.
