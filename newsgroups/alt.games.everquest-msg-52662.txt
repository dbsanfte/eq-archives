Don't group with Bard much, perhaps?

Bard song pulses change your targeting - which can hose up substitution
macros like you outline above. Using a macro of the form:

/assist someplayername

is in fact the most reliable. However, I have seen empirical evidence that
there are some *places* in EQ where the assist command does not work
reliably at all. The Queen Room in Chardok is the one specific example where
an entire raid's worth of people were unable to get the correct target even
though they had all correctly macroed the right person (and he was alive,
targeted the correct mob, and was present in the room).

The in-game macros were a nice additional feature, but there appear to be
some rather serious targeting issues, as well as timing issues. The macros
appear to execute in a kinda funny order, which is most noticeable when the
network connection is heavily lagged; which may be a side-effect of parts of
the commands being divided up between local and sever execution and the fact
they probably didn't make any effort to synchronize that execution.
Speculation, really...
