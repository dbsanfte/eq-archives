Yup, you should try it some time.

Comparing the use of the word 'hero' and it's meaning in different
arenas (rpg fiction vs. real life) sure.

Comparing the actions of a fictional rpg 'hero' to those of a real
person risking their life for others, not in a million years. 

Next you'll be saying clerics are blasphemous for casting resurrect,
when it's belittling religion and/or the work of doctors.

It's called 'context'. When you're done with comprehension 101, maybe
you could find time for to look that up.
