Surely you don't need to read posts twice.  I always quote the part I am 
replying to (as above) so that it follows on without you having to read 
the whole thread again.  What I dislike is having to scroll down three 
pages of text to get to the new post.

We are all individuals.  If we were all the same then life would be 
boring.  I do things they way they work for me and I put up with it when 
people do things differently because that's they way they work for them.

IMHO doing something one way simply because that's the way everybody 
else does it is not a valid reason.  I'm not a sheep.  I do things the 
way they make sense for me.  If you disagree that's fine.  You are 
entitled to your opinion.  As am I.

That's what I like about debating an issue with you folks.  Good, 
intelligent, well thought-out comments.  You must have spent hours 
thinking up that argument.  First rate. Oh and FYI it's "arsehole".  An 
ass is a breed of donkey.
