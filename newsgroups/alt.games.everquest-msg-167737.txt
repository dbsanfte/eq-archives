A fourth benefit, once you have the horse up, you can click on the
bridle for an instant click.  This is of quite limited usefulness,
since it isn't a true insta buff, I'm not sure whether horse can be
dispelled at all, but if it is, the horse will become a three second
click anyway.  It might possibly be of use against mobs like Aary,
where you need to cast to get rid of an illusional massive drop in
your mana bar... this effect seems to be pretty rare, though.

So really its just a fix to a disadvantage I also forgot.  With
graphics off, your mana bar won't update to show your meditation
effect unless you are casting.  So if you aren't chain clicking some
item (as I usually am) your mana bar stops moving, making you think
the horse isn't working.  Click bridle occaisionally and you see your
mana bar update properly.
