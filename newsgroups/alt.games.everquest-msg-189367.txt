My intent was NOT to cast dispersions on the game or any one still
playing EQ. Please do not take my post out of context.

I was simply saying good-bye to the many fine folks I have meet over
the years in EQ. I needed to find a game that was more casual player
friendly.

I am currently playing EQOA and enjoying it. It is more of an EQ-Lite
and allows me to play for short perionds and without long camps for
objects and quests. Great fun.

If anyone is playing EQOA you can find me on server Hodstock.
