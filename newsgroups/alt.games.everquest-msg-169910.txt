as an old pen and paper RPG player i like to find answers to that in
roleplay terms since i hope that VI/Sony still treat their online RPG as
a...well...RPG ))))

as far as i  understand lull and harmony work on the sentient natural mind
and conciousness of the creater casted upon. well in poi you face machines,
old rusted, freaked out, gone haywire machines! no mind, no natural sentient
behaviour. they attack everything.
in CT u face the direct minions of CT an evil God, thus bestowed with his
"blessing" and his power of fear. i think that rules out those spells,
doesnt it?
