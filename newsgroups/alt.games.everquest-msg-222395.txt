heal

: so I am open to critisism what would you do in the situation?

2 things:

1) As a necro, you did right.  Your 30pt heal would be worthless with a
train of Fungals beating on the tank.
2) IT WAS PALUDAL!  The exp loss was easily overcomne in about 3 kills.  Who
cares if anyone dies there.  If he was complaining about dieing, tell him to
get over it, put him on you idiots list and get away from him.  IF he really
thought you should have been healing the tanks, explain to him that he is
being an idiot, and add himn to your idiots list.
