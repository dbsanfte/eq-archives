Here's a list of what I know sells for a lot to vendors:

- lots of Lower Guk loot like Adamantite Epaulets
- Kunark armor, around 300pp each or so (Tolan's, Deepwater etc.)
- a whip with levitate charges from Kaesora, can't remember name
- Blackened Iron/Alloy Coifs
- Forest Loops

There's probably a lot more.
