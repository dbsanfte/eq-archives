I decided to just go with the straight Commisioner Henry route after
reading your comments and talking to some others. I did the quest four
times to get up to apprehensive with the three sub-sect factions in
Shadowhaven. (I wound up using the human type merchants with the forge
up on the upper deck, not the shorties. Not sure which faction they are
on, but it's one of the slower-to-raise ones. Their merchant was just
more convenient with the large size banded molds, the sheet metal, and
the forge about ten feet away from each other. There was also a water
merchant a short run away.) 

I did the quest two additional times but was still at apprehensive. I'd
wanted to be at indifferent, but I grew tired of the quest at that point
and just started smithing. Turns out it was a "nevermind" kind of thing
anyway, because my wife had her enchanter mule in the zone anyway making
stacks of viscous mana, so she just did it in the smithy shop and did my
buying for me. Much higher faction, huge charisma = better prices. 

I got my smithing to 167 before the toothpicks wouldn't keep my eyes
open any longer and I called it a night. I think 175 is within my grasp
if today's patch doesn't nerf the trivials on banded to the point where
I'm stuck here.
