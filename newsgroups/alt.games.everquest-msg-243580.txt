LOL!!!  i have a question who the hell cares?  this is a newsgroup for
people addicted to everquest, not people who give a damn about what goes on
outside their little door with the welcome mat laid nice and square on
porch.

here we are talking about whether or not eq2 is going to be a good game, and
what class is the best for what race, and then BAM!!! black people killing
white people!  that's quite a transition right there.  goes back to the
appropriate newsgroup thing i guess...

and as for the Bush thing, we all know that the majority of Americans didn't
want Bush for president (except for that one guy who's not American, but
thinks he knows about whats going on in America, then shoots his mouth off
about things that didn't even happen...), but America has a very unusual,
roundabout way of doing things, so he got there anyway.  oh well, whats done
is done.  deal with it.  after all, Bush only wanted to be president because
his daddy told him to go kill Saddam, and now he's working on doing just
that.  so sure the president made more of the world hate Americans than
previously, but does that make him a bad president?  well, yes.  yes it
does.

i think you're gonna need more than a hat for this shit storm.  perhaps an
umbrella would do the trick?
