Yeah, any time I see a xp rez under level 30 I wonder why they don't just go
kill a bat.  Under 40 isn't a big rush for me, even a guild mate...ya got 3
hours, I'll get to you when convenient.  I don't have a cleric but have
access to my brother's 59 and my friend's 56.

Both of those clerics are dwarves, and my main character is a gnome.  EVEN
IF YOU'RE A GUILD MEMBER, I'm NOT rezzing your lazyassed dwarf/gnome killer
self in Butcherblock or Steamfont.  SCREW YOU.  Nice attitude, eh? :)

People get rather pissed off when someone ignores their rez/port beg.  I'm
past caring.

Playing the cleric I'll do a /who and if you're in an allied guild or a
certain class or guild that I don't want to piss off, you'll get an answer
for sure.  If I'm in a good mood and you're level 50+ you'll get an answer.
Both times it's often "no, sorry, I can't right now," but it's an answer.
If you're under 30 and I'm in a good mood you WILL get a "no, sorry, I can't
right now," unless their corpse happens to be under my feet before they ask.

No one at a druid ring or EC tunnel under level 20 gets a damned thing from
me.  I totally ignore them.  Freaking beggars.  I don't care if I have a
full bar of mana that I can safely spend...newbie beggars don't get jack
shit.   In fact, if they're in a guild I'll often go looking for an
officer/leader to see if buff begging is something they promote.
