At that level I think you can solo stuff in the overthere by going
toe-to-toe with the mobs. Just debuff the mob with slow, and possibly
a strength debuff, then beat it down with your pet. You might have
some extra difficulty until you get your melee skills up to a decent
level.

My 52 shaman can still solo this way against dark-blue giants in
Burning Woods. It's pretty cool being a caster that can tank and club
a giant to death.

Also, light blue mobs will give you skill raises, and they are
generally easy to kill, so try to melee these.
