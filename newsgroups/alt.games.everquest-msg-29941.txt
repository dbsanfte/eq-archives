What does surprise me is that the women in this group seem to give their
tacit approval, unable to raise a murmur in their own defence.

What doesn't surprise, is both your's and Ron's, attitude to women (not that

If someone gives your mother a left hook, you will be able to say to
yourself....

"Well, I can understand that, she was probably asking for it (not that I
condone that sort of thing)".
