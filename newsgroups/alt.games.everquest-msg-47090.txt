In his 40's now, apparently, Human Warrior.
Although I, also, think he's a troll it's not impossible he is totally
unaware of Crushbone. If agnostic he'd have started in Qeynos, long way
crushbone and by the time he left the Qeynos Zones ( Blackborrow, Karanas,
Highpass, Everfrost etc) He'd have no reason to hunt in Crushbone. None of
my characters ever have, ok, I know where it is and have been to those zones
but then I never rushed thru levels and explored a lot.

I once spoke to a 52nd level High Elf enchanter who had no idea what the
Split Paw or Tesch Mas Gnolls were, in SK.
