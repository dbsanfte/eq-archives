As is any semblance of sense, in your dribblings
on Usenet.

Who says they are unintentional, you cretin. 

How do you get "changing a complete sentence" is
unintentional?

They are not unintentional if I do it
deliberately, in the same way I might add
emoticons, deliberately.

Forget about emoticons, you need talking books.

> or random changes,

Deliberate random changes, not unintentional ones.

You really don't know whats going on, do you?

Try and read what you wrote, and then the reply,
so you get some feeling for context.

Unfortunately there is no emoticon, as of yet,
that can help you remember that bit of advice, but
if you keep posting, someone will need to invent
one.

> which means you (of
>course) missed the point.

You don't have a relevant point, as usual.

Derrida

As I said, get someone to read it aloud for you,
Maybe draw a few pictures and diagrams. Take a few
courses in basic English. Fuck.. take a LOT of
courses in basic English. 

You seem far beyond the help of humble, overworked
emoticons. May as well put water wings on the
Titanic.

You like Bob Dylan?

"Now, I wish I could write you a melody so plain 
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane 
That could ease you and cool you and cease the
pain 
Of your useless and pointless knowledge"
