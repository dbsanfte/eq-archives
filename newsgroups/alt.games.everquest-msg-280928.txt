It wasn't... I don't think I've ever looted a black steel wrap I was 
excited about before, I always had access to better gear than I could 
loot by the time Velious came out, even pre-luclin/Bazaar.

Yes, soloing is the norm, and if you're going to be doing it on "loot it 
yourself" gear, that means planning ahead and picking a soloable class, 
or doing the other thing which seems to be the norm, dual botting.

Yes, this is very true... but I don't see how its relevant to the 
concept of deliberately rejecting that.  So what if everyone else is 
doing it, hell, I've done it myself for years.  The point of this 
exercise is doing something most people haven't, and having fun seeins 
what you -can- do with that.  I can hold my own in a twinked out group, 
IF I make it clear I'm not tanking reds for them, I'm more like an 
enchanter in tin foil.

Oh, and the potions you're talking about aren't off limits by ED rules; 
anything a vendor sells in unlimited quantities is kosher, we just don't 
buy things from them that are only there because another player sold it 
to them.

Sure, I'm not disputing that, the ED concept isn't one of saying "ick, 
thats cheating, don't give in" but rather a more austere "lets try it 
without and see what its like".  Its like deliberately getting rid of 
your car and insisting on only walking or riding your bike to get 
places; its like being a vegetarian; its like travelling by sailboat 
instead of powerboat.  When I'm hiking from one side of the 
Superstitions to the other, I'm not thinking about how much faster it 
would have been to just drive around the mountains to the other side 
(which, some hours later, my wife will spend a half hour doing to pick 
me up); its about the journey.

There have actually been quite a few changes to the lower end game, for 
good or ill, and at any rate I'm hardly confined to the old world zones; 
there's plenty to do in kunark, luclin, and later velious, plus LDoN's, 
and now I'm reaching LOY levels.  I've also heard that there's a 
scalable instance in Nedaria's Landing that anyone can use to grind out 
some exp if thats what they want to do... haven't tried it yet.

What you're missing, though, is the possibility that "handicapping" 
myself in this particular way may well add interest in the game, because 
instead of a bunch of crappy gear that isn't anywhere near as good as 
what I bought in the bazaar for a song, suddenly we're looking at a 
bunch of gear thats twice as good as anything I have.

Its no different, in general, from moving to a new server, in order to 
make a clean start over; I've done that a number of times and always 
enjoyed it at least as much as making a new alt and twinking him out 
with all the gear my 60/65 former main could muster... this is just a 
more hardcore version of the same thing.
