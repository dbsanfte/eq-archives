Ahem.  One *brews* beer (and sake).  This involves throwing stuff in a pot, 
boiling it, then letting it ferment.  This is the distinction between 
winemaking and beermaking: wines simply sit and ferment with no prior 
application of heat.  Either is legal to do at home in the US, though you 
can't _sell_ your product without a license.

Moonshine, whisk(e)y, brandy, rum, tequila and so forth are *distilled*, 
which requires applying heat to an already-alcoholic liquid, and catching 
the vapors somehow (usually in those little corkscrewing tubes you see in 
cartoons and on TV).  Brandy, for example, is distilled wine.  It is also 
possible to ice-distill, where you barely freeze the liquid so that some of 
the water ice leaves the beverage, and what remains liquid is a more 
alcoholic drink.

Distillation of alcoholic beverages is illegal to do at home in the US, 
though I've seen little mini-stills for sale in some catalogs.

ObEQ: Anyone know of a good guide to Alcohol Tolerance?  It seems as though 
there are "trivial levels" to various drinks.  Is there a list somewhere?
