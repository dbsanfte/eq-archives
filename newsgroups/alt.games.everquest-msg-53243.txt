I went to stonebrunt tonight.  Firsttime.  Got lost going through the
warrens.  Met some batlings.  Died.  Got my butt all the way to stonebrunt
on my fourth corpse run.  I was 22, now I'm 21 again.  Man it's been a long
day.

Stonebrunt is awesome looking though.  I was feeling so pissy I looked
around for a few minutes and then ported myself to EK to sulk.  Didn't bind
myself first.  I guess I'll go hunt in everfrost for awhile.

I feel like the bank robber who shot himself in the dick.

But at least I can blame the whole thing on the batlings.
