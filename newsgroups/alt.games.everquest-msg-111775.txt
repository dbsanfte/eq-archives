I had semi same experience... walked thru empty Sro (going to rm running
friend something) and walked into an AC... My enchanter already has boots
but I figure I can either MQ them for some money or give to cleric... I'm
swapping spells and stand up to take on the ac and watch him get KS'd by
merchants... 2 days later, 130+ silk swatchs from killing spiders to get
spawn and no ac... gotta love it tho...
