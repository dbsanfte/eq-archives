Its download only at this moment. After its initial release they did release
a limited amount of CD's for LOY, but they aren't being sold any longer.

It is included in the Everquest: Evolutions pack, but that means you would
buy evrything again up until LOY in one pack. Not worth the money.....

Don't worry about this download, it is safely added to your account.
