	Neither are linear progression games.

	Kind of like how PoP ZEM's made 90% of the world obsolete, eh?

	Good question.  The answer is to avoid the item camps in the first place,
seeing as how practically no one will do them electively.  (I'd leave in a few
for people who like to collect merit badges, like me, but the bulk of item
acquisition in the game should studiously avoid the current mechanic.)

	Which they have to do anyway, since most of the customer base will never
be top-end.

	No, they'll get hooked if the game is *fun to play*.  The skinner-box
felderkarb is just nonsense.
