Is there some kind of moral high ground in being a
"bit-player"?

And, wasn't America, one of this "Shop of Horrors"
chief patrons?

None at all. Empires are born, and perpetuated,
through blood. This includes the USA, as well as
Britain.

I was just curious as to why you chose those
particular examples, and what your point was.

Neither the Opium Wars, nor the Boxer Rebellion
reflect well on the USA.

What would you say if they were?

I think some of them are saying exactly that, even
though some people will want to take a swipe at
America, or rather, Americans, using any excuse
they can... but;

their criticisms do not automatically become
invalid simply because their ancestors fucked up,
nor because they are jealous of the current world
superpower and/or nostalgic for their own empire,
now turned to dust.

I agree absolutely. The thing is that the USA, is
currently the Great Satan, as all empires become.
It has the most power to do evil, if it should
choose to, and whether it is evil or not, it will
certainly be taking the brunt of any criticism.

A minor downside for the USA, when you consider
the benefits.

What restraint would that be?

Are they comparable simply because you are
comparing them?

Your last two examples proved to me there wasn't
much difference between the two. And, probably not
much difference with any empire that preceded the
British.

I have no idea what you are saying here.

This is from
http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v97/n196/a03.html

"Imports soared, and nearly every American company
followed suit, acquiring "black dirt" in Turkey or
as agents for Indian producers.  

Writing home, Delano said he could not pretend to
justify the opium trade on moral grounds, "but as
a merchant I insist it has been .  .  .  fair,
honorable and legitimate," and no more
objectionable than the importation of wines and
spirits to the U.S."

And American trading companies, nauseatingly eager
not be missing out, on any of that filthy lucre.

"Yes its morally reprehensible what them damn
Brits are doing, but business is business"

"Hey, I didn't beat the nigger up, I didn't chain
him to the back of the car, it wasn't me who was
driving... I just took his wallet, and sat in the
passenger seat, drinking with the boys... no sir,
you can't blame me at all."

> British rants about American imperialism
>are, IMO, pretty fucking pathetic.

That, they surely are... but are they true?

America, and Americans, can choose to ignore or
answer the criticism as they see fit, and there
are probably quite a few who say they have no case
to answer.

However, an attempt at justification by saying, as
you seem to be saying... "Well... the British were
worse" is as worthless as it would be for
Churchill to defend his imperialism, by saying...
"Well.. the Romans were worse"
