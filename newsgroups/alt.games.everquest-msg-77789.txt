I take umbrage with your statement that there is no such thing
as a video card "without Umbra"! Sure there is. No Umbra in my
video card! Betcha there's none in yours too...

>take umbrage with the waitress
You do so, and the Teapot cafe seems a little less dim, which unfortunately
can't be said of its employees, not excluding the waitress. She ducks out for
a few seconds and returns to hurriedly set your table with something strange
and crude for an eating instrument, a hatchet.

>get hatchet

>bury hatchet
Into whom do you want to bury the hatchet?
