Another excellent point in favor of the paladin stunner.  While you may not
want the paladin to be MA, if he does happen to get the love briefly its
not a big deal, the mob won't be moving much since he's right on top
of it anyway, and he's designed to stand up to a beating better even than
a cleric is.  Clerics are certainly better than chanters at this, but get
plenty of aggro off heals and really would prefer not to grab more with a
perfectly good paladin handy.
