That's BS. 

The single group/soloer benefits from uber gear far more than anybody 
but a raid puller and raid MT. Most people on most raids can wear cloth 
armour for all it really matters. Sure they need resists for the AEs... 
and what not... and the extra health, regen, and hitpoints all help out. 

But its in the single group or solo situation where it really matters 
what you've got. 2k more hp on the 31st dps guy on a raid is truly 
irrelevant.

Sure! As long as spiderlings keep dropping silks the soloers will always 
have something to do right?

When people say they wan't solo content, they mean interesting solo 
content. They do not want to hang out in Kunark/Velious doing ancient 
quests, farming pp in Rathe Mtns, or hang out on a boat in Dulak.


There is no reason raiders should get substantially better gear:


Raiders are not better players, nor are they more skilled. In fact 
people who solo, and group are often more adept when facing challenges. 
The only thing the average raider can do is:

1) Show up often and on demand.
2) Follow instructions.

These are not traits that should be disproportionately rewarded. We 
aren't rewarding the best players, we're rewarding the players who make 
good sheep and can stay with their herd.
