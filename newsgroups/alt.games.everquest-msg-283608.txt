Hard is all I can say.  My guild regularly raids there but a force of
about 25 peeps. half bazaar geared and best tank is about 14k hp.
Takes us about 6 hours just to go halfway if we plow from start.  My
guild is nowhere near the level of hard core raiding guild but we can
handle VT just fine.

First time raiding there without the benefit of high level buyable
gears is defiantly going to be hard.

But wait till we get to Overlord Mata Muram.  Took the top guilds
month before OMM was killed.
