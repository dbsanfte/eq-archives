Least expensive is definately to train 20 points, no question.  OTOH, the
cost per sharpening stone is on the order of 9 copper.  I vaguely recall
going through several stacks, not sure how many, of stones to trivial that
part, then giving away the rest to aspiring smiths in Halas and Qeynos,
which are very far away from the nearest sharpening stones.
