Never. AC is number one, as much as possible on 
every slot. HP is number two, stamina is number 3
only in so far as the amount of HP it gives and having
enough to not get fatiqued from weapon swings.

100 is supposed to be the magic number for not fatiguing, but
then I've heard other people say this is a myth. My troll has 125
without trying to raise stamina, but that is because she had higher 
than 100 to start. 


>2. try and obtain a few STR items?

Pretty moot and most melee gear eventually has str on it anyway.
Its mostly nice for carrying capacity. The sta seems to be what will
keep you from getting as fatigued with weapon swings.

Forget most stats and concentrate on super high AC.
Eventually the best AC gear for your class will also have HP/stats,
etc. Barbed Ringmail should be your first target, its around 2500 plat
now or less on most servers in the bazaar. It is 30 ac, 10 str and 50
hp, the str is not why you'd want it but is a nice bonus.

>concentrate on AC or HP specifically?

AC, hp is a bonus. Barbed ringmail is a good example of something with
a lot of both. Don't get something with low AC just because it has
some hit points. Good affordable Pally and Sk wearable gear usually
does have ok AC, hit points and even mana sometimes.

Is an example, it is my troll sk's magelo. On it so far I've gone for
affordable things in the bazaar which were about the highest AC/HP per
slot that I could reasonably afford.

The shisshar scaled guants and dragonwing mantle are nice because
they have okay AC AND mana/hit points. Skull shaped barbute is still
pretty much the most affordable AC/HP helm. Enshrouded veil is pretty
cheap now while once again having that good Pally/Shadownight combo
of ok AC with hitpoints AND mana. I keep meaning to swap out the
spider fur collar with one of the newer AC/HP collars availible now.

Her int is only 83 but I never run out of mana, its just not that big
a concern as a melee who also casts. Her raw gear alone is:

Plus 541 HP
Plus 130 Mana

Hit modifiers on the magelo, at the left, then HP to see the
list of HP stuff and the total, for example. I think I did pretty ok 
considering the character was really "twinked" piecemeal on a rather
severe budget. The 3 bigger price items, at the time I bought them,
were her Ebon mace/dragonborn sash (24 percent haste)/Barbed ringmail.

As a paladin I'd forget a heavier 2 hand like that runed blade and
search the bazaar for 1 h blunt. That fantastic 1 h blunt from planes
of power is sold there dirt cheap, making my sk jealous of paladins.
It has a FANTASTIC ratio of like 24 speed 21 damage or something
insane. You can also equip a shield such as the charred guardian
(cheap, great ac and HP) or Sarnak berserker shield (cheaper than it
was now, great ac, HP, resists)
