You mean a restriction similar to one that doesn't let you
cast a spell when you de-level below its level requirement?
Or do you mean a restriction similar to one that doesn't
let you cast certain buffs directly on people below their
required level?   Or do you mean a restriction similar to
one that won't let you cast certain spells on targets other
than their intended class like the rez line which can only
be cast on corpses?

Spell casting ability is obviously checked at the time of actually
casting the spell.  Having the spell scribed (or mem'd) isn't
relevant at all.   They may not have changed it ~yet~ but I
wouldn't count on them not fixing it if they haven't already.
