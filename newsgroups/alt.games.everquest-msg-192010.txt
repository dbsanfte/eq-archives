At release, Whirl wasn't breakable. It lasted a full 18 secs. The problem 
was that us enchanters would then use it to keep MOBs shut down and unable 
to fight back for 18 secs which was long enough for the melees to kill it. 
Verant found this to be way too powerful (was still used as an upper level 
tactic even, because there was no level limit on it) and nerfed it.

That's about the time I quit my enchanter because along with that nerf they 
nerfed a lot of other things and made enchanters pretty much worthless for 
a while.
