I was thinking of the Lifetap line actually, but the name
had slipped my mind... I like Dark Pact, usually have it on
100% of the time. But the lifetap line just doesn't do enough
damage for the mana lost.

I've started using Leach (leech?) to keep my HP up...
I have to get into the habit of fear kiting, at the moment
my tactics are pretty much to pull with a DoT, sic pet on
MOB, add more DoTs and heal my pet, but that's not proving
to be very time-efficient. And has been pretty marginal in
terms of risk/return.

Thanks for the tip, I'd ducked in there when level 4 or so and
everything was red, so wasn't sure what level they would be soloable.

I'm probably past the point where that's practical unfortunately.

I'm always annoyed when people talk about 1000pp as if it
wasn't a lot of money. The most money any of my characters
has ever had at one time was 850pp, after several levels of
scrimping and saving. Of course my cleric is only level 42
(and clerics aren't much of a money-making class anyway) but
1000pp is 500 MOBs dropping 2 plat each, or about 10000
MOBs dropping 1 gold each.

I'm trying to get around that by making leather paddings but
getting LQ+ skins around Cabilis is proving to be a pain.
(OTOH I have about 80 spider silks and 60 spiderling silks
accumulated.)

You've reached the 50s so you clearly have *some*
idea what you're doing. And doing it without uber gear
counts as a recommendation in book. :-)
