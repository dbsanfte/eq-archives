it is encouraged on Fv. it isnt prohibited on any of the other servers 
so far as i can tell.

if you want to be a mundane playing grab all the cookies, go for it. 
heck, you may have grouped with me on sol ro and taken advantage of me. 
fine. i play the way i want to and you play the way you want to. you can 
be as ueber as you like, i will potter along as a gimp doing the best i 
can with how i am willing to play. i do know that i will get random 
buffs from people that i have played with in the past or helped in the 
past and been told that it is because i have a 'great heart' as several 
nonenglish speakers have put it.
