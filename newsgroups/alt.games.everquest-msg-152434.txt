Yuh, well, it's actually my second lvl 11 druid.  The first few levels are 
fine, just like any other.  But it seems like, right where it starts to 
diverge and become different from the other classes, it suddenly starts to 
get terminally dull.  Even if I get myself oober chanty buffs.  Dunno 
why... I've tried every class but paladin to this level, most somewhat 
higher, and this is the only one where I'm left with utterly no desire to 
go further.
