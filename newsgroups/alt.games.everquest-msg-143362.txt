}Ok this much I know-- Higher dex for warriors dose mean more procs AND

Nope.

}My strength seems to be enough that I do more damage than
}someone else with same weapons. Whats the take on this? Should I atleast get
}100 dex? Or, just screw the dex and leave at 73?

Well, there's evidence that agi has a critical cap at 75, so you might 
try to get your dex up to 75 just in case there's a similar cap, but that 
said... Don't worry about stats.  Stats mae a teeny bit of difference, and 
as you level up and get better gear, they'll end up going up anyway 
without you stressing about it.

You're a warrior.  You want high AC.  And lots of hit points.  Sta has a 
bit of influence on hit points, but generally not as much as +HP gear 
does.  Get armor that is as high AC as you can manage, and then go level 
more instead of farting around in the bazaar.  Killing things is much more 
fun than shopping, IMO. :)
