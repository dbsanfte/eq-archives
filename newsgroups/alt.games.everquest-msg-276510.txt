It's not that at all.

There was a mitigation change to monks only (to make them take more damage,
period) and *in addition*, monks get an extremely low AC softcap (not much
over 1400 with all defensive aa's).

So in addition to just taking more damage, period, anything over 1400 AC is
worthless in terms of char advancement for monks (actual 1, per perceived 40
so 2k AC for a monk provides the comparable benefit of ~1415 AC).  Whereas
other classes still gain benefits from AC at 2k+.

Pardon my plagiarization.  His post answered your question just fine...
