You have to learn to use your filters. Odd group dynamic, but are you
familiar with the term "Whiping boy"? The two major forms of exchange in
newsgroups are factual debate and venting. The "Names" thread happened to
serve as whiping boy/allowed people to vent their frustrations by his post.
Catharsis is a really good word thast describes the process.

Actually most people recognize the ecconomic reality of the MMO market: More
is better $$$. Specifically it has deteriorated from from an average age of
31 years old<according to marketing data released by UO in 1997 IIRC> to
what now appears to be dumping ground for ill mannered brats who's parents
don't want to deal with them. AC, EQ, UO, AO, DII, all $0-$10/month
babysitter cum dumping grounds for the maladjusted child.

Bad names alone are almost tolerated if they aren't bad enough. As soon as
it gets to becoming an unpaid babysitter via annoying behavior vis a vis
begging, cheating, and whining, they get petitioned.

Actually, it is just heated debate. Some of us go back to the early nineties
and other newsgroups doing this to each other. Nothing personal, but
language escalates in order to convey strongly held beliefs. I fully expect
someone to tell me I have "shit for brains" if I make a major error. Nothing
personal, just conveying how far off I missed the mark. It is the close
misses that get a "shit for brains" comment when people take exception. I
mean in real life I smirk a lot, around newsgroups you have to use
CAPs/shout. Limitation of the medium.

Hahahah!

Actually it is positions, rational debate, and to a lesser degree
personality that control any newsgroup. Champion unpopular opinions and make
irrational arguments that can't be supported and you are SOL. The converse
of this statement holds true.

Not a chance.<grin>
