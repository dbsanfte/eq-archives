Exactly Conrad. The way they sneaked it in has really pissed me off
too. Obviously customers are going to wonder why they keep getting the
chop and look for other reasons and waste their time. They should have
at least had the balls to announce it. For that reason alone I will
walk. Luckily an NTLWorld CD dropped through my door two days ago. I
had registered for it ages ago but as an ex CWC subscriber they have
just  got around to providing the service in my area. I was going to
chuck it out.....Lucky I didn't. It's two hour cut offs but at least
that's reasonable and it's a standard DUN connection. Methinks AOL
will lose a lot of accounts over this. Maybe that's what they want ?.
