Start killing spiders and collecting "Spider Silk". At your level you
should be able to partner up and hunt the Desert Tarantulas in North
Ro.

Buy a small sewing kit for 6-7gp and combine 2 unstacked silks (1 silk
in each window of the sewing kit) to make a "Silk Swatch". You will
NEVER fail at combining silk into swatches. As you do this your
tailoring skill will slowly go up. 

Once you have 20-30 Silk Swatches you can attempt to make "Raw Silk
Armor" or "Cured Silk Armor" for yourself. Cured Silk requires a
limited skill in Brewing (50-60pts) You shoud be able to find the
recipes at www.eqtraders.com or www.lokari.net

You can also sell the Silk Swatches to other tailors, or trade
swatches for Raw Silk or Cure Silk armor. 

A full set of cured silk should run no more than 200-250pp depending
on the server you are playing on. Wu's is most likely twice that. At
level 44 I am still using a few pieces of Cured Silk armor.

Player Made Monk Armor progression:
Raw Silk
Cured Silk
Wu's Fighting Armor
Then High level Velious recipes
