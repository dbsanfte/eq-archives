"Atrocity is recognized as such by victim and perpetrator alike, by all who
learn about it at whatever remove. Atrocity has no excuses, no mitigating
argument. Atrocity never balances or rectifies the past. Atrocity merely
arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-perpetuating upon itself--a
barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits atrocity also commits those
future atrocities thus bred."
