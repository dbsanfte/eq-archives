Low 20s... No...  Wait til about 32 or 33...  35 would be better.  Reason:
HGs resists a lot...  Unless you plan on running to zone or dying a lot...
HGs are hands off unless you have friends to help you.  I know this from
experience and it gets a little easier as you get closer to 40.  SGs are a
little easier at equivalent level, and you can then start working on the
root and dot method along with the snare.  Just be more mindful of the
lowbies running around and the occasional High level trying to take it from
you.
