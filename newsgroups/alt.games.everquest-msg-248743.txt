I would have suggested that the faction system should have been a tree
instead of a list of values.

For example, you might have "Freeport faction" at +2, "Mage faction"
at +2 and "Cleric faction" at -2.

In freeport, the mages would like you a lot (+4) and the clerics would
be indifferent (0). You could go kick the clerics in their collective
shins, and get a -1 to cleric faction, but you're beating up on
clerics in freeport, so you'd probably get a Freeport -1 as well.

Good / Evil is interesting this way, as you start to describe
*communities* not ideologies. For example, in Qyenos, the evil guards
are still guards. They should care about you killing someone in the
city, as long as they're not directly opposed to that person.

However, before any of that makes sense, I think there would need to
be some rules governing faction. For example, you should never take a
faction hit for killing something without witnesses. This allows
rogues to kill without faction hits by sneaking in to a location and
assassinating their target quickly and quietly. A bit more realistic,
IMHO.

Also, a players deity and class should not matter. I don't get a "wand
of deity / class sniffing" and neither should an NPC. Hate me because
I'm Iksar, fine. But hate me because I'm a necromancer who worships
Cazic-Thule? How do you know? Perhaps if a mob sees me casting a
necromancer spell, but not just because it's in the server's database.
That's totally bogus.

If that were the case, languages could be more important too, which
would be quite nice. Languages are so under-used, even on FV where
they should be all-important. Langauges should play directly into
faction, agro, pricing, etc. Speak the wrong language to a vendor and
you might pay twice as much, or they might call the guards!
