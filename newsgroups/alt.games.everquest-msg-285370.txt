I finally got around to downloading EQ.  It took 4 hours to get the
trilogy down and then another 2.5 hours to patch.  Glad to see that
things haven't changed much since I've been away.  I dread having to
get the expansions.  Anyway, I tweaked the eqclient.ini file and copied
the maps downloaded Mapfiend into the maps folder.  There is folder
called ATLAS in the EQ folder.  Now my memory isn't that great but I
don't recall that being in the folder a few years ago.  Anybody know
what it is for?  Does it have to be updated as well? And if so, does
anyone know where a good update source is?
