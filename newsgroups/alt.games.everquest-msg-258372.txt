I tried that, he takes 5 minutes to respawn, and longer than that to 
regen to full hp if I don't kill him; its faster to kill him than it is 
to wait for him to feel better.  Hows that for a heath care slogan for 
the Bush administration?

Ideally I'd get an enchanter to come charm him, then have a cleric give 
him Faith and Khazad (avoiding increasing his AC on the theory that you 
get more skill ups on successes) and then when he gets low, repeat and 
CHeal him.

Hey, I wonder if there are any of those odd mobs who don't aggro but do 
cast heals on their injured buddies around, I could aggro one and drag 
him to the warrens then zone out, come back in and let him "help"

On a more likely note, perhaps I could remove some STR gear; am I right 
in thinking that more STR doesn't make you hit more often, just for more 
damage?
