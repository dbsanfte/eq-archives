It didn't read like that to me.  It read like, "Hi, I've been gone, and I
noticed this.  Am I imagining it?"

Jess, some zones have gained a lot more higher levels looking for LDON
adventures--Butcherblock and North Ro seem to be the biggies, along with
East Commons, Everfrost and South Ro.  Steamfont, Innothule, and Freeport
are "gateway" zones to them--you zone in from PoK, then head there--so
natch, there's more going through there, too.
