Firepets have approx.  2/3rds the hp of an earth pet,
but they also have better AC, so they don't get pounded
like the earth pets do.  You should travel to Luclin
(or get someone to do it for you) and get the Summon
Phantom Chain spell (it summons a bag full of no-rent
chain-mail).  Use this to equip your pet with armor
(you hand the pieces to him one at a time, not the 
entire bag at once).  At level 39 you use Phantom
Plate.  This allows him to tank better.  I was able
to solo Gnolls at the spires with a 29 fire-pet 
before the phantom armor came along, you should be
fine.  A better place to level is OT in a group,
those damn gnolls are too damn camped.

Make sure you start working on your focus item 
quests.  Summoning a pet with the appropriate 
item equipped results in it have the HP of the
next higher HP pet (Firepet gets Air's hp, Air
gets Water, Water gets Earth, Earth just gets
betters stats).  This helps them tank enormously.
