    Funny, I've never done it that way. (Chanter 41 SK 65)

    As MT I would always assist the puller and attack that mob, irrespective
of how many were incoming. As chanter I would expect an MT to do that, and
stay on that target until its down before selecting another. This allows the
CC to predict what mob will be tanked first, and allows the puller to do the
other half of his job. (target selection)

    It also means that the rules don't change when your MT is also puller,
and that adds get mezzed sooner.
