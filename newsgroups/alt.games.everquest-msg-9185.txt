Your FBSS will stack will spells. It will not stack with the Mithrill 2
hander as it is an effect like the FBSS, procs from weapons will stack as
they are spells. You cannot have a proc and a spell, the proc will overwrite
the spell unless the spell has a higher haste amount than the proc. The FBSS
will stack with a spell and will also stack with Bard songs
