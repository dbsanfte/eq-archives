    Not unless the duration is really, really long. Then I could see someone
like a wizard out quadding using them for an extra safety margin. But by and

    There's already a limit on how many potions you can quaff in a given
time frame. They recently tightened the limit after the low level monk
"soloed" Vox with a bunch of those shaman healing potions (and the help of
some Divine Arbitration-equipped clerics).
