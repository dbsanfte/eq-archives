Hi.
I'm relatively new to EQ; I came aboard through the CGW offer, and
like the game enough to subscribe.
In the last week, I've noticed a lot of what, if this were a MUD, I'd
call 'lag'. The screen may freeze for a few seconds, or as long as
half a minute. This seems to happen regardless of the number of
players in the zone- whether 10 or 96. 
I've also noticed that while this happens, my hard drive shows
evidence of running a program- the working light flickers, etc.
I already play with my sound card disabled, as it was causing freezes
while zoning, so I'm at a loss to figure out what's going on or how to
fix it. I do know that 'lag' is potentially deadly; if a mob were to
spawn near me while I was lagged, or if the lag were to occur during
combat, I'd very likely be dead.
Any advice? I'm only running the very basic EQ, no expansion sets. 
I have 64 Mb of RAM, and plenty of storage space.

Thanks,

The Beatnik
