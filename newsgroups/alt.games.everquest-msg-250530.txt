Well I mostly do missions, and I've run into a few I couldn't do alone - 
at least the bosses with my ill/rad controller, and my blasters generally 
can't take any bosses of thier own level.  And as you get higher in level 
it's much harder to find groups of enemies outside small enough to take 
alone.  I suppose you could just do greens, but you'll be leveling so 
slowly it'd be too painful.  I got in a group yesterday that was taking 
on greys with green lieutenants, it was awful, woo 10 xp for a group of 
villains.  It was safe though.

I soloed my eq enchanter quite a bit for being on at weird hours and not 
having the time to go places when I was, as well as my cleric, and let me 
tell you those are not what people generally think of as soloing classes.  
I got my enchanter to 54 before I quit out of boredom.  I will say a good 
duo in EQ is way hell of a lot better than soloing, but ususally soloing 
is better than full groups if you just want xp.

I've heard plenty of stories that tankers can't solo (exept fire) at 
higher level due to thier poor damage output.
