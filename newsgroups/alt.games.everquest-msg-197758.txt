Not being flagged, I have no clue what this means.  Maybe I should think about
getting flagged now, if its a single group exp/loot zone instead of a raid zone
my guild never raids.

I'm clueless about this

Hmm, don't remember anyone reporting weirdness with this event.  We always did
it by the book, 18 people in three groups, all in raid; even back when most of
the guild didn't have POP, anyone able to do this raid with us had POP by
definition.

OH, so it was AOE they were trying to stop, not bards or druids soloing?  Well
who knew.  I'm saddened to hear that they don't like AE groups, though, which
seem to have mostly vanished with the advent of POP.  I saw that style of play
as high risk for high reward, and allowing a radically different group than the
traditional "tank, slow, heal, mez, DPS, DPS" groups.

Well thats nice of them, can't think how many times we've killed bosses for no
drop at all.  Luckily they weren't hard to kill.  I guess this means they will
be more hotly contested though.
