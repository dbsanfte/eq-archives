I know many people have discussed instanced missions and what not.  From
my experience with COH, one of the greatest online experiences I have ever
experienced.  I must say if EQ2 can duplicate the unique 3 story office 
missions
that my wife and I encountered at COH...well just read one of my older posts
and tell me if you do not agree !

What I do know is that
I find myself compelled to log in every night and play, play, play, because
my wife and I are having a great time. We are both level 17 with our current
Heroes (we re-rolled after taking previous Heroes to 20) and mostly duo
together, roaming the streets in seach of bad guys to kill and missions for
our contacts. We played a mission last night that introduced us to a new map
I'd never seen. We were winding our way through this deep, three-story
office complex, taking elevators to three separate fighting areas, twisting
and turning around corners and ambushes that kept us white-knuckled
throughout. We had to save 7 hostages and free them, and this required
locating them hidden away in all kinds of odd places and taking out the
guards (some of whom were wired with self-explosives). It was outrageously
fun and required all of our best tactics to stay alive. As a Controller and
Defender, we don't have a lot of damage dealing to our credit, and we were
fighting the Tsoo, probably the most difficult mobs to fight at our level,
and the battles were furious and fun. We failed the mission with 1 hostage
to go :( but wow, what a fun experience. In the end, we didn't feel cheated,
we felt disappointed! We let our contact down. :(  Tonight we go back and
take on the next mission from this contact and hopefully will redeem
ourselves.

I haven't heard anyone yet discuss the Task Force missions (mostly because
they are still bugged and being fixed), and no discussion whatsoever of the
Trials. Trials involve 50 or more players and seem like pretty extraordinary
raid-like events. These are in game now and yet no one is talking about
them, probably because no one posting here has experienced them. But the
descriptions I've heard of these Trial events make them seem like they're
going to be very challenging and require the cooperation of many
Supergrouped heroes. Sounds like raiding to me.

Seems to me that there's a lot of information still to come in on this
question and the jury remains out. I've heard comments from people
suggesting that now that someone has already hit level 40 and HE didn't have
anything to add about endgame content, that's the end of story. Well, that
would be comparable in my mind to concluding that EverQuest has no endgame
either because a Rogue hit level 50 in just a few months after release and
he didn't have anything to say about an endgame either. You can race to the
highest level without hitting any endgame content if that's your goal. It
doesn't mean it isn't there.

I'll look forward to hearing more about this as time goes on and more of the
game is exposed to players. Until then, I don't know how anyone can come to
any meaningful conclusion and in any case, I'm not going to get too
concerned about it until I stop having fun. ;-)
