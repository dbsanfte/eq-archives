For one thing, an early slow attempt is one of the best ways for a
warrior to grab early agro. Shaman slows and if the warrior gets a
successful taunt right after that, he's just got a major bump up on
the hate list. It's one of the few ways out there for a warrior to
actually grab quick agro in a fight. 

95% of the time, it's better to have a slowed mob beating on the
shaman for a few seconds than an unslowed mob beating on anyone else.

EQ would probably be a more balanced game if that where true. At the
higher end, the DPS limit for casters tends to be agro not mana. Given
how hard your average PoP mob hits and the fact that they tend to die
in under 90 seconds, waiting 20 seconds before slowing so your warrior
can gain solid agro just isn't a great choice. The little better
ability of a warrior to tank is minor (unless you need defensive)
compared to a knights ability to taunt.
