It has been over fifty years since the rape of Palestine. Fifty years of murder, rape,
theft and destruction. Peace? What Peace? There has been nothing but destruction and war
since 1948 when the Zionist cancer first appeared in the heart of the Arab world. Shame on
those who have stood silently by as the crime of the century was being committed, shame on
those who still stand silently as Palestine is being raped. "

The so-called peace process is nothing more but the surrender of the Palestine people to
their Zionist occupiers. Not only have the Zionists established a colony called Israel on
Palestinian lands, they are now forcing the Palestinian people to accept oppression and
occupation.

The self-autonomy zones that Former Prime Minister Netanyahu is proposing, or imposing,
are modeled after the hometowns rule that use to exist in South Africa. When apartheid was
at its height and the non-white South African population refused to live as second class
citizens, the South African government suggested the formation of hometowns. A hometown is
basically a powerless, ineffective state within a state. It has the authority to build
roads, collect garbage, police traffic, impose tax and other trivial duties. Real power
rested with the South African government and its racist regime. The West Bank autonomy
zones that Israel wants to create are almost identical. In these zones, the Palestinian
authority will have no real power accept the power to oppress Palestinian civilians. The
Palestinian people want nothing less then a sovereign state on Palestinian soil.

Netanyahu has said that as long as there is resistance to Israeli occupation, Israel will
not honor any treaty it signs. Basically, this means that until every Palestinian who
opposes oppression is either murdered or imprisoned, Israel will not honor any agreement.
Given these facts, there is no point in signing any agreement with Israel knowing that the
Israeli government will find an excuse not to honor it. Israel's refusal to honor the
peace treaty is not surprising. Since it ominous creation in 1948, Israeli has made a
mockery of international law and every treaty it has signed.
