these songs seem to mention 10 years, that would be Jan, 1993. That =
sounds disturbingly accurate.

*Ramble On,
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song.
I'm goin' 'round the world,
I got to find my girl, on my way.
Been this way ten years to the day, Ramble On,
Find the queen of all my dreams.

Oh yeah
It's been ten years, half my life
Just getting ready but then it was time
Warpage in the figures, radios appear
Midnight was the barrier, back in 1963
