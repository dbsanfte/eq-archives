Without a doubt.  Pure capitalism leads to a tiny, tiny number of
ultra-rich people with hordes of ultra-poor people.

I think socialism is the only sustainable model, but it must be a
flexible socialism; i.e., it must lean (perhaps heavily) towards
capitalism when it's necessary to do so, and must lean (perhaps
heavily) towards communism when it's necessary to do so.

Agreed.  What most people don't realize, however, is most of the free
hand-outs are given to big business, not to individuals.  I laugh
everytime someone gets their panties in a bundle over welfare.
Corporate welfare is a much bigger problem.
