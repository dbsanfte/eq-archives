Excellent idea ... gets my vote for sure.

The keys could be added to the keyring I guess so you wouldn't end up with a
few backpacks full of no drop keys. Would take very little work to implement
it ingame too ... after all, before they gave PoK to everyone, clicking on
the books without the PoK expansion did nothing ... they just need to do the
same check for each individual book to see if you've picked up the key.

As it stands players who have joined since PoK have no idea of how much time
they're saving using the books ... as has already been posted they need to
experience running through zones they might never have visited with unknown
dangers .. like running through Kithicor to get from Qeynos to Freeport and
finding out night time is a no-no :)

Could bring some life to the old world zones in the process as people
realise there are mobs and exp to be had away from the current popular
zones.
