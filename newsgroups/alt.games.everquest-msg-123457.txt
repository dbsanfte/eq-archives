Fun thread.
   My dumbest question, I think, was when I created a dwarf paladin, and somehow
managed to run her to the docks alive.  I ran around and hailed all the NPC's I could
find, then ran to Freeport bound dock and noticed another dwarf PC there.  I asked
him whom I should speak to charter a boat.  He laughed, and told me that it would
show up on its own presently.  Then I asked him how much it cost to ride the boat.

Annie <--- Glad he didn't try to sell her a ticket.
