The guy offering 200 plat was likely in a zone where corpse retrieval was
litterally impossible(be it see invis mobs, a trap door that once he went in
couldnt get back out of, or something else), I know if my beastlord falls in
battle in droga, I would rather have it summoned back to the zoneline and go
from there, rather than trying to get it, and i'd happily pay that much for
the service, especially if someone had to run from pok to do it.


At any rate, it takes a high level necro/sk to do summons for the people who
can afford 200p. as far as crushbone goes, I wouldnt even bother with a rez
if I fell in battle there, much less a corpse summoning, but alas.. im not a
new player either.



If you want to make money and dont have time to farm spider silks like
everyone else suggests newbies do, then I recommend you to check vendors in
pok for tainted planar essence. it costs 6p each and you can get 40p or
better in bazaar for it (on karana anyway) and theres usually at least a FEW
pieces on a vendor each day (ive bought stacks before, though). also, blue
diamonds cost 262p on a vendor, and sell for over 500 in bazaar. in short
time you will make decent money.



(these are both high demand items for tradeskillers and you *will* make
money reselling them)

once you start to get a good collection of money going, you may wish to
further explore your options for reselling, to quote from the rules of
acquisition..

A wise man can hear profit in the wind.
