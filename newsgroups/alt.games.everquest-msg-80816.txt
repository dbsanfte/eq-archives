It's Pickpocket and Beg.  Separate those two, and the others
will have no problems.  Probably both having something to
do with getting money out of the character without killing him
"duping" money or something.

> Don't you have to sneak AND hide to evade combat?

Nope, just hide.  AND, you're not really hidden.  Say
that you successfully evade, and then the critter is
dead without you ever doing anything else to "un-hide."
You're still visible.  Anything that comes along that
normally wouldn't see you hidden will see you.  You
have to manually un-hide and then re-hide when you're
no longer aggro'd to successfully hide.

Again, what's the point of macroing it, then?
If it's situational (and like I pointed out below,
sometimes you don't want to evade at all
period), why risk locking up your hotkeys
in the middle of Fear or Blackburrow or
Cazic Thule?  Just don't evade...you're a
rogue, you'll get aggro quick enough. Unless
the caster is really getting whaled on and
his health drops low, in which case you're
not going to draw aggro until he's dead,
anyways.

I don't have anything against pickpocket.  It's
a needed skill to  do the rogue epic.  It's a class-
defining skill.  I'm just saying it seems like kind
of a pointless skill to macro when you can just
make a hot key for the ability itself. Stop combat,
pickpocket, hide, do whatever, start combat.
Controlling your aggro to be below the warrior
but above the cleric is a fine line, which I'd rather
handle manually than through a macro.  Of
course, in an Overthere group where your AC
is higher than the warrior's AC and you have
more HPS to boot, go ahead.  When the Master
of Spite summons you and you evade, you might
actually want to NOT attack immediately again,
or pickpocket, or beg, or disarm, or fart in his
general direction :-).

I was really happy about macro-ability when it
was added to the game...but after a year or so
to play with it, I'd still rather do it the old one-at-
a-time way for most skills (not all, most).  More
control is a good thing.
