Druids are the characters that constantly get bothered for buffs. My friends
Level 40 ranger is rarely asked for SOW (although at lower levels he made
loads by being a tracker for high level characters) but my L20 druid gets
asked for sow, bind, heals, and ports literally all the time (can't do group
ports not high enough level - but they see you port in and assume that you
are lying to them). I even helped a L14 character who bit off a bit more
then he could chew by healing him and then helping him finish off his target
(after the health bar had dropped below half) and the result of that was
that he kept pulling stuff my way until I finally let him die (of course he
then responded with "Why didn't you help me?")

Most people I have come across seem to expect you to help them as if we all
knew that signing up to be a druid made you their private bitch. If people
offer to donate money for SOW then I will generally give it to them for free
(especially if they are low levels as money is hard to come by) but if a
high level character is willing to offer me plat for SOWing then I will take
it.
