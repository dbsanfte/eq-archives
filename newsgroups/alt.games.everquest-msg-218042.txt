Wizard snares, then nukes till the mob is really angry, mage
sends pet (with taunt off) and nukes while wizard runs, nukes,
runs, nukes.  Classic Aggro Kite, no worries.  If mage gets
aggro, no problem, doesn't matter who is pulling the kite about. 
If pet gets aggro, again, not fatal, mage pets make decent tanks,
and you just nuke until you pry it off him.  If space is limited,
either have the pet tank while casters nuke more gently, or else
set up on opposite corners and ping pong the mob.  'Course the
wizard might be better off quadding, but maybe not, what with the
20% group bonus and the "free" DPS from the pet.   Mage will
certainly be better off than soloing, again that 20% bonus, plus
the mob will be snared, and root will be available if the pair
wants to root and shoot instead (earth pet root sucks eggs)
 
> Shaman/Enchanter
Shaman will have benefit of added mana regen, enchanter will
benefit from having a healer handy. Enchanter will benefit from
having someone else to root mobs when charm breaks plus charm
plus added HP.  Shaman will benefit from the much higher DPS of a
charmed pet.  All in all I'd think the duo would be significantly
better than either of the two classes soloing, remember all they
have to do is kill more than twice as many mobs per hour as
either to be ahead... and they get a 20% bonus for grouping to go
along with it.

> Rogue/Wizard

Wizard snares and angers mob, rogue gives chase and backstabs
while wizard pulls the kite around on his string, nuking more as
mana permits.  Rogue Evades as needed to help keep mob chasing
wizard.  Lacks a healer, but still probably kill more mobs per
hour than wizard quad kiting due to the "free" rogue damage and
the 20% bonus.  Definately will kill more mobs per hour than a
rogue soloing.

> Rogue/Mage

Sadly you can't have the mage pet tank, since the code won't let
the mob attack pets if a player is also in melee range.  But you
-can- still aggro kite as above, and get the added benefit of the
mage pet; only problem is you have to have the rogue tank till
his snare weapon procs; this is probably the worst duo of the
ones you proposed.  Question, can the rogue tank and then Evade
to turn the mob around to the pet for his backstabs?  At worst
its still better than the rogue soloing... and probably still
better than the mage soloing as well, frankly, at least so far
mages aren't really all that and a bag of chips for soloing (I'm
only up to 38 so it might get better later)
