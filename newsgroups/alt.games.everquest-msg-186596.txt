    Yes there are UK servers - for a noob a newer server might be a good
idea, or might not, I really like started on povar (which i think is
ancient) because so many zones were allllll for me and my friends hehe.
Roleplaying..... I enjoyed roleplaying too but the *only* roleplaying
preferred server has some nasty restrictive rules I didn't want to put up
with, you might want to read up on them before you leap in.

    Every single level I've been on has been fun, the more you concentrate
on just levelling up the less fun they are, and obviously some or more
interesting than others. I managed to hit 30 in a month of play and a bout
30 hours so that's not too bad. The 30's aren't that hard to get through and
the 40's really open a lot of doors in terms of where you can play around.
As to the cap at 65, haven't got there yet and I've been playing since
sep... which i think is pretty good for the game really. (up to 52 which is
a HUGE distance down from 65)

    Well, yes and no. There are zones for every level where finding a group
is easy, finding a competant one seems to be 50/50 for the first few levels
and slowly gets better odds after that. Finding a *good* group...... I could
probably count the groups I'd call particularly good that I've been in on
one hand :)

    www.eqatlas.com
    www.castersrealm.com
    a few other sites around I'm sure you'll get a bundle posted.
