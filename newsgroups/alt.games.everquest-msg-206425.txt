Others have answere whether it's OK, so I want to present another
alternative. Wait a month. :) THey have a package coming out in
(allegedly) august that has all the expansions up to Ykesha for $30. I
paid over $100 to get all the expansions less than 2 months ago, that's
a great deal. If SWG hasn't really grabbed me by then, I'll be grabbing
a copy and boxing.
