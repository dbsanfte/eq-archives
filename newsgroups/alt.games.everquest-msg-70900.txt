Jeff,

The cleric epic is well worth the time and effort to get one.  It
remains extremely useful well beyond Kunark.  Not only for the
resurrections, but the stats on it are very nice.  There is only one
weapon out there that has better stats for clerics - Blackstar, Mace
of Night.  From what you've posted it doesn't sound like you will be
clearing North ToV anytime soon (where Blackstar is dropped), so the
epic is your best bet.
