Along the west coast there is a dock. I'd invis up and swim straight west to
other shore.
Go south a tad to Kerran ridge zone and before you zone get a non erudite
illusion memmed.
Get a map.
Zone . Illusion. move slowly and con the first kitties you see to make sure
you are not KoS.
Go straight cross bridge. Immediately turn left and follow shore line south
then west.
You will pass 1 dock with a kitty on it.
When you reach the second dock stop. Dock on your left. Bar ahead. Bar to
right and Wharf Building to right. You should see little rats running around
the shore. A Wharf rat is in the building to the right. Go con it. Kill it.
The mice are social iirc. Any way kill all the rats and the Wharf rat.
The Wharf rat drops a tooth. Turn the tooth into the kitty on the second
dock. where you originally stopped. Lousy item great experience.

If you keep ahead of the mice/named rat there are fish in the water to kill
as well.
A named fish may spawn. If it does and if it drops pole? turn into the kitty
fishing on the water SE of dock.

The exp bonus is worth eating a few deaths here.
