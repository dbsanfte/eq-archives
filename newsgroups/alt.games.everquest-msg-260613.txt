Yep, and thats generally what I'm going to have to play with, since the 
situations where I'm going to use it aren't going to be ones I hit again 
and again, they're going to be "pull this one out of the fire" situations.

So I'll just assume Blue = Crits and Red = Hits

Either is sure to increase my DPS temporarily, even if I'm wrong about 
which would be ideal I won't be completely wasting the effect.

I don't really see your logic.  To me, the boost in DPS over the long 
term of hitting offensive every time its available is... minimal.  For 
45 seconds out of every 25 minutes I approximately double my DPS.  Thats 
a 4% increase in overall DPS, better than me getting crits but not 
really all that earth shaking.

On the other hand, when the chips are down, its a 100% increase more or 
less, I'm killing -that- troublesome mob twice as fast.

I guess in part this thinking is because you can't use both defensive 
and offensive disciplines.  At this point I only have one defensive 
discipline, and it only works for 12 seconds, not really enough to save 
a group although it is handy if I'm near death and the CHeal isn't 
landing yet.

So at this point, I think of Defensive as saving -me- and Offensive as 
saving group.

This morning I was in a GE group, serving as MT but with a beastlord 
also in the group.  We got an over pull, so that I was on one mob, he 
was on one mob, and his pet was off tanking a third mob.  I burned my 
offensive discipline (cleaving this time) and dropped my mob fairly fast 
so I could go take the heat off his pet, which was definately on the 
losing end of the game.  If I'd used my defensive disc very little would 
have changed; my mob would have dropped marginally faster due to me 
riposting all his blows, and thats about it.  But as things were going 
his pet was going to die before we could get free... so having offensive 
disc available to boost my kill speed made a big difference.
