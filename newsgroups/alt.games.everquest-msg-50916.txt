this is not actually the case.  EQ does have a limit on plat.  if their
wasn't a limit on plat then we would be in a freefall deflationary period,
since plat would become pretty worthless if everyone had an endless supply.
Imagine everyone having 5 million plat.

The goods isn't endless either, although some items that are farmed more are
more plentiful.

in real economics, its possible to give every family a TV or microwave, but
there is still not an endless supply of them.  In EQ economics, its also
limited in supply.  Frenzy's in lower guk and djarnn efreeti will only drop
the FBSS and GEB's so many times in a given day, thus the production lines
of them dropping is already limited.

you had a few interesting points later on, but the idea of just destroying
uber lewt is not super realistic, although in certain situations people are
doing just that by getting themselves banned, quitting with their equipment,
finding ways to die without recovering bodies.
