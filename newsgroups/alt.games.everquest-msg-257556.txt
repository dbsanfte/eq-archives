For me this is the most annoying thing. Prior to the patch I was
levelling a second BST in FV and I could sit and see when the Forest
Giant spawned. Post patch, in the same spot, grey fog is all I can see.
Also, when the pet proc's, it's like Flash of Light has been cast on me.
Can't see a thing other than whitish grey fog or a bright light.

The new name tags on these mobs is a joke!
