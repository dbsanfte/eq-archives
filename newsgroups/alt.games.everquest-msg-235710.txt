Pre level 35(34?) mobs forget you when you FD.  At 35+ they generally
/ sometimes(?) only forget you once they get back to their spawn
point.

Think I first hit that when pulling giants from the fort in GD .. was
a bit surprising when they kept coming back for another swing once I
stood up again!

Very useful post 35 update for monks.
