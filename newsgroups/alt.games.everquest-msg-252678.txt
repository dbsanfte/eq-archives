But it doesn't automatically follow that because someone would pay RL cash
for an ingame item that that ingame item has an _inherent_ monetary value
that a court would recognize.

Just because I can find some schlub to pay me $50 for a worthless item
doesn't mean that the worthless item suddenly has a value of $50.  When it
comes to the case of my platinum, all of which exists on SOE's servers and
can be destroyed at their whim without first requiring my permission, it's
hardly an easy issue.  Where does SOE come in with regards to my platinum
ingame?  Do I own it entirely?  Do they?  Do we co-own it?  How so?
Something like that would certainly affect whatever RL value one would try
to place on my platinum, and that issue hasn't been considered by a court,
but I'd be shocked if a court would find that the code signifying "my
platinum" doesn't ultimately belong solely to SOE.
