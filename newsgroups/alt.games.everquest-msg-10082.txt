Ok, assume you are a 30ish warrior, and you just can't get the people
and firepower together to get the damned werewolf talon out of the
ballroom in Mistmoore without developing a serious case of death, and
assume you don't have a ton of plat after you just blew a bunch on
gemstones for your other crafted armor.  You have a large bronze BP at
the moment and are looking to seriously upgrade. You have the ability to
put together a full party of high 20's to low/mid 30's  on fairly short
notice with a decent balance/mix of classes who can organize to take on
mobs suitable to their level.  What mobs/where are there that you could
camp and have some chance of them dropping a nice piece of chest slot
armor with good A/C, and nice stats for a starving young troll warrior?
I looked at the BI Mail in Runnyeye, and was not impressed. I've heard
people make mention of "Dusty" dropping a BP of some sort, but no clue
who this Dusty fellow is.  Any other ideas certainly welcome.
TIA
