The Federalist issue 02-29

Culture comment...


Big Brothers Big Sisters of America is now requiring all 500 of its local
affiliates to enlist practicing homosexuals as volunteers and mentors for
BBBSA kids. Making matters worse, parents whose children are enrolled in
school-based BBBSA programs may not be told that their child is matched with
a homosexual.
