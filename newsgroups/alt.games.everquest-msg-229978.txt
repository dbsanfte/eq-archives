Where do you get that the two sub-classes are all good/evil
counterparts? I don't see anywhere on the site where it even hints at
that. Yeah, some clearly are, but not most. From what I see, the major
difference between each of the sub-classes in most cases, with a few
exceptions, is one's more offensive in nature while the other is more
defensive. Being offensive in nature doesn't make one evil, just as
being defensive doesn't make one good.
