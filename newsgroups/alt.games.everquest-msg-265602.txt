I've played EQ on dial up, DSL and cable. On dial up, it's amazingly 
efficient and not really a very noticable slow down. The stuff that's sent 
over the wire is pretty minimal, mostly tokenized triggers that make for a 
pretty small payload so you won't notice much difference. Where you WILL 
notice a big difference, of course, is patching. Life is hell in the MMOG 
world for dial up users who have to patch a lot.

As for DSL vs cable, you'll find people who will argue till they're blue in 
the face that one is better than the other. I have both synchronous DSL 768 
and 1.5mb cable and I switch back and forth between the two depending on 
what I'm doing. I use cable mostly and DSL for FPS and other upload heavy 
applications. In my experience, there is no real significant difference at 
all between the two for most MMOG experiences and in the end your location 
is probably going to play a bigger factor in your performance than whether 
you are using DSL or cable.
