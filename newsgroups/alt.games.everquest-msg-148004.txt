	No.  Eventually you get all the nuts, and it *ends*.  Not every vendetta

	toMAYto, toMAHto.

	If the trail should happen to lead to US citizens then you have to go
through the formality of due process.  Otherwise, just nail the bastards.
There is no reason to do otherwise.  If you are basing your argument on some
kind of concept of "natural rights" understand that I don't believe in any
such thing.

|>or kill them
|
|State Sponsored MURDER... even better. You just created another 'martyr to
|be avenged'

	Maybe.  If so we'll kill his avengers too.  I know for damn sure that
putting terrorists in jail is a Grade A-1 Stupid Move: you just ensure that
his friends will start taking hostages to try to convince you to release him.
At least if you kill them you diminsh the supply of fanatics.

	The kind of behavior you are describing -- one martyr after another
sacrificing himself -- is irrational.  How do you deal with irrational people?
You certainly can't negotiate with them.  That only leaves "shoot them first".

|> rebuild the buildings exactly as they were
|
|A very 'head in the sand' attitude... especially when this particular
|attrocity revealed the flaws in the construction methods originally used...
|ask any fireman about 'floor trusses'

	Correcting the design flaws would be OK, of course.

|> and get on with life.
|
|Whose life?

	The nation's.  Life in general.

|But you DO advocate such civilised behaviour as 'detention without trial'
|and 'state sponsored murder'... well done, your tolerant attitudes do you
|credit.

	No, I only support detention in the event of home-grown terrorists or
collaborators, assuming you can't get a death sentence.  Foreigners get
bullets, and preferrably the bodies never get found.

|Which is of course a silly idea... Saddam gasing his own, unarmed, people
|would never disturb another government... after all, it's his people, why
|should anyone care?

	Other nations don't care.  It made a convenient PR foil, but at the end of
the day the US doesn't give a damn what Saddam Hussein does to his own people.
IT'S NOT OUR DAMN COUNTRY.

|> I assert that this is complete and utter nonsense.
|
|/em goes back and checks his history books...
|
|gosh, you're right, it IS utter nonsense

	Is every war or feud started in history still ongoing?  The answer is
'no'.

|None of whom recognise that they ARE nutcases...

	I believe that is required in the definition of 'nutcase', actually.

|The US has not officially 'declared war' since Hitler...

	I'm well aware of that.  Something I don't like; I think declarations of
war serve a necessary function.

|On the contrary... the sacrifice of a single martyr in a suicide bombing can
|have devastating consequences for the 'projection of power'. When a suicide
|bomber attacked the Marine Corps barracks in Beruit, Lebanon, the result was
|a withdrawal of US military personel from the country on the grounds of
|security considerations.

	Temporarily.  Then we assassinated one of the people responsible and
bombed the living hell out of their military forces.  (Mind you, Lebanon was
another fool's exercise.  The same guys who capped the aforementioned leader
recovered evidence that the Druze milita was going to switch sides, and it was
completely ignored by the Reagan administration.)

|From a terrorist perspective, this was a perfect
|'operation'... military casualties, civilian outrage, US policy change.

	Except for the part about them being blown to hell shortly thereafter.

	Did it change lasting US policy?  No.  We are still involved in the
Mideast and we are still supporting Israel.

|Yes... US Airforce Carpet Bombs Afghan Wedding Party... that was handled
|well.

	It's a war, people die.  If your nation is at war, shooting guns off at
random times is probably not a cool thing to do.

	(I remember one of my sister's ex-boyfriends, a Greek fellow, telling me
about his brother stationed on one of their borders (forget which now)...if
you stepped outside for a smoke you had to yell "CIGARETTE!" in two languages
first or you'd get shot as soon as you struck the match.)

|And THIS, ladies and gentlemen, is why the US is hated by millions.

	We're going to be hated by millions no matter what we do.  Can't please
everyone.

|This is the reason why the US is in the middle of an escallating trade war
|with the EC.

	Boo hoo.

|This is the reason why the US Budget Defecit is back after less than 2 years
|of 'Dubya' in charge.

	Oh, the defecit never went away.  The government uses shadier accounting
techniques than Enron.

|Define 'meaningful'

	If it doesn't affect your ability to wage war, it's not meaningful.

|And now I KNOW you're a Nazi

	I WIN!

|Nations do not go to war FULL STOP.
|
|PEOPLE go to war.

	People do not go to war.  People can't.  I don't care how mad someone is
at the US, there's not a thing he can do about it other than perhaps sacrifice
himself in a pointless and ineffective single attack.  War is the business of
nations.

|Funerals... before or after the hostages are dead?

	Before.  Technically.

	Hostages are casualties.

|Last time, there was the excuse that Saddam had invaded a neighbour... THAT
|is the only reason a multi-CULTURAL coalition survived.

	And this time, there is the "excuse" that he is sheltering al-Qaida
forces.

|Isreal is becoming more heavy-handed in its suppression of the Palestinians
|and US has kept too quiet about it.

	FWIW I'm not happy with Israel's current policies and I do think they
should be kept on a short leash.

|Next time...
|Who knows?

	The next time they will buy the plausable illusion they are offered,
because they do not want to get into a war with a superpower.  They know they
can't win and they know no one is going to help them; their ecomonic and
social policies have pissed off everyone else in the first world.  And at the
end of the day, simply put, their ruling castes are just too fucking rich to
care as long as their own safety and wealth aren't threatened.
