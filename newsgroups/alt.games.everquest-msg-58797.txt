I have no snare, I routinely root and rot mobs, I do not get pounded on.
The trick is to root, dot, dot, move away, sit, med, wait until something
needs to be refreshed.  I will get hit sometimes, but not enough to matter,
as I do this to mobs that do not run at sow speed, and I sit far enough away
to stand, and cast Enstill before the mob reaches me.  Resists are what
cause me to be hit at all, and I always pull the mob with my best MR debuff
spell, so resists are not that common.  Mind you, snare would certainly
simplify things for me.
