Under the existing system, person B is only recognized as earning 40k, 
and he's taxed on that. Under the new system he's taxed on 50k.

His lifestyle didn't change, he's not making more money than he used to, 
he's not spending more money than used to, his tax burden went up.

Yep and if you go to -most- other places you'll pay 5-15%, down from 
23%, not to mention, as others have noted, you can claw some of that tax 
back in many cases. In any case that's a considerable tax break on 
vacations.
