buffie, but still.)

	That's on a production server.  Life is completely different on Test.
Sometimes you can find good items at low prices -- 'liende has a Centi SS,
Leaf Scale Gauntlets and a Weighty Polearm -- but often stuff is just plain
not to be had, or insanely priced.  She's still wearing Pine Scout tunic, legs
and one bracer, for instance.
