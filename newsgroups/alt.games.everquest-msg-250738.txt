The game engine... how to define this... the game engine is that stuff
which deals with everything dealing with taunt, agro, position,
pulling, weapon damage, armor mitigation, healing, cornering, mob AE,
spells, etc. All of that stuff has to be programmed. If a rogue does
something as simple as a backstab... how exactly does the game know
the rogue is at the back of the mob for it to go off? When a player
backs up and goes 'out of range'.. how does the game know that? All of
it ties into the engine using fairly complex equations just to
calculate distance, position, etc before word one on graphics.
Something as simple as expanding caps can cause unexpected problems if
assumptions were made for the checks. A good example was when people
started getting items that reached caps and the variable 'rolled over'
rather than staying at the hard cap.

EQ may be something new.. but no way.. none.. does the programming
thinking change. If anything, it was only reinforced with the DX9
stuff. The changes.. they had to happen to stay competitive, no doubt.
But no one at SoE had any conception of the sheer magnitude of the
problems that would occur as a result. After all.. its just graphics..
write the new engine, hook it up, and send it live. Right? I'll clip
from a developer comment after the fit hit the shan, its reposted from
a post a couple days ago:

>*
The walled/cornered NPC bug was the direct result of the client and 
server having two different values for the radius that is used for the
collision sphere. This collision sphere is what is used as the basis
for where an NPC and player can move. One of the things that changed
with the DX9 engine was the introduction of data structures
specifically designed to track collision states. The old engine didn't
have this. These data structures will (and have) allowed us to make
optimizations  that the old engine simply couldn't support because it
didn't have any concept of persistent collision data; everything was
based on the scale  of the model and that's it. Anyways, in these data
structures the new engine had the collision size set at one point,
then the model was scaled, and the bug is that the collision sphere
was not also scaled on the server because the server doesn't actually
load the model data so it has nothing to scale.. This caused NPCs to
have a collision radius of 1.2 on the server for instance where cazic
thule in potime on the client was using 4.7 or so. The server would
think the NPC is properly cornered but the clients would all think it
was on the opposite side of the wall causing a bunch of bugs you all
know about by now. Once the collision sizes were synchronized these
problems went away. This was also part of the problem with pathing for
very small NPCs (the spiders in podisease for instance) because they
were constantly getting stuck in the ground due to having a collision
sphere on the server *larger* than what the client was using.
>*

And that was just one bug they were able to lock down and address..
they're gonna be picking bugs out of the soup for at least another
couple weeks.

Unfortunately.. that isn't a decision that is available. They've
allready done at least 90% of the development on EQ2.. the bird is
gonna launch. From what it sounds like.. they're looking to make it
similar to CoH.. a more group-friendly casual user enviornment to hit
more of a broader user base while leaving EQ as the raiding
enviornment of choice. At the moment.. MMORPG's are trying to strike
the magic chord that resonates a huge casual user base over the
relatively small hard core base. At the moment there are like 300-600
hundred thousand users of Everquest depending on who you ask. While
that may seem like a lot games such as Starcraft, Warcraft, Diablo,
etc sell in the millions. They want a game without the heavy start-up
that appeals to Joe Gamer that can just go buy.. install.. and have a
blast pretty quickly without the heavy front-end in both knowledge and
work that goes into playing EQ. Hell, playing Everquest almost
requires a couple years study and play for the new gamer(some more
than others) to get a decent broad knowledge set.

I think they stand a good chance of getting both up and running. It
will be tricky to negotiate, but the gamble is almost required for the
long-term viability of the company. The nice part will be if they can
use EQ2 as a starter pistol for EQ. You bring them in with EQ2 and as
they tire and want to learn more move into EQ for the more complex
engine and raiding enviornment.

Everquest has always been a game where the player outgrows zones. Its
the nature of the beast.. they've been trying to do instanced areas to
solve the issue and have the generated dungeon be equivalent to the
level of the group/raid hitting it... but really it can only go so
far. And frankly.. instancing in its current form I don't really like.
It loses a lot of the potency in say Old Sebilis... or Karnor's
Castle.. Kael Drakkel. It certainly has its uses... like to prevent
cockblocking on progression events and to allow multiple access to
top-end zones, but it should be used only in moderation.

And one other thing... one of the things i truly hate about GoD is the
feeling that someone used a name-generator for the zones. Txevu? Uqua?
Qvic? WTF. Can we go back to somewhat English names for zones please?

>how many times have we seen the idea mentioned that there

How good would you make the reward? If we're talking a new Velious-era
quest.. shouldn't be the reward be equivalent to that era? If it was..
who would want it? Or are we referring to something like the Oracle
quest... spanning several expansions and providing a really decent
item.

Considering that there was basically a general work-stoppage and
strike by the players to the point where SoE had to have a guild
summit here in San Diego to smooth things over... uh.. yeah. Afterlife
disbanded and went to WoW.. FoH hasn't been heard from in a while, but
they're probably in WoW too.

On the bright side.. the communication is a lot better between SoE and
their players. Where that goes we'll see.

Personally.. i'd have to say it just stems from the difficulty of
doing what they were attempting to do without fully testing a lot of
the secondary side-effects. The upgrade was going to be difficult.. no
matter which way they went about it.
