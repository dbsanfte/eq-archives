If the world is big enough, Dark Age of Camelot might qualify.  It's
only PvP against people from the other two Realms in the world.  If they
have enough monsters and quests well within each Realm, away from the
frontiers, it should be safe.  They say they are going to put enough in
for people to go all the way through the game without PKing if they
want.

You can read the details at www.darkageofcamelot.com.
