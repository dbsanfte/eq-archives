You asked for examples of Ingot being attacked or insulted,
not abused.  To quote you:

: To cut a long debate short... Would you mind quoting *one single* 
: post,  mine or otherwise, in which Ingot is attacked or insulted

I supplied some examples of insults:

: Dan Day accused Ingot of claiming the "sky was falling" every time
: SOE made a change.

: Knightsend commented, "Get over it."

: Zarris told Ingot to "grow up".

: Roger Bonzer suggested to Ingot that he should cry himself to sleep.

: Khosh called Ignot's opinion assinine.

Some of these are only borderline insulting, but at least a few
are downright insulting.

You didn't ask for examples of abuse, David.

When you go to McDonalds, do you ask for a hamburger and get upset
when they give you a hamburger instead of chicken?
