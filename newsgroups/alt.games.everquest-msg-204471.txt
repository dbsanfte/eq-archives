Thanks for the replies. If I had known it would last so long I would 
never have gone to trader mode before bed. I could have squeezed another 
hour of leveling out of it :)  The person who cast it upon me didn't say 
anything about a longer duration, I guess he was keeping it under wraps.

What do C3s go for nowadays? I have always paid 100pp for mine, despite 
this being my first character with currently just over 600pp in the 
bank. One Enchanter told me I was being generous and that, while 100pp 
was standard on most other servers, he was scoffed at on Cazic-Thule for 
asking 50pp.

I am not rich by any means, but I feel that a round of C3 is certainly 
worth 100pp to me, as I can solo quad enemies with ease and gain half a 
level or more with little trouble throughout its duration.
