This is always going to be a problem - the /bazaar and /trader commands are
only available to the people using the NewUI, and as virtually all trade (on
my server at least) has moved to the Bazaar, both buyers and sellers who
either don't have the NewUI themselves, or have the NewUI but also want to
trade with others who don't have it, will still use traditional methods.

In the short term this is going to be common as plenty of players are
holding off the new interface until the bugs are fixed, the bazaar
perfomance improves, and they get hardware capable of using it!

Of course this isn't helped by those that think it is clever to output multi
line "come to my shop" adverts ....
