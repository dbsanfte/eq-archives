Huh?  I honestly think you're talking out of your ass here.  Take two new 
computers with no OS on them, a RedHat CD and an XP CD, and start 
installing both.  See which is easier.  (Hint:  I've never hit install, 
gone to lunch, and come back with any Windows OS installed and ready for 
login.)

Have you even looked at the KDE, Gnome, and other GUI projects?  OK, 
granted, they look a bit different than your Windows desktop with the 
default settings, but you can do just about everything with the GUI now.  
Install StarOffice to cover your productivity apps, and get used to a 
computer that actually stays up.
