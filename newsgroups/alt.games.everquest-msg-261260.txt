Aye, reversing their stance on this was ultimately a wise decision. I
doubt there was really a "vision" behind giving them a bow, just a poor
assumption on the part of one section of SOE.

What I'm curious to know is if the ranger epic is again a pair of swords,
or if it is just one 1hs (like the old bard epic was).

I can't wait for screenshots to start rolling in for ALL the epics.
There's someone on the studio who has a friend who has the druid epic 1.5,
but no pictures yet.
