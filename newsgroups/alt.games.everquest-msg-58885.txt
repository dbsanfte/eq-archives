I am currently trying DAoC, and while there is much I like about it,
there is also much I don't like. In those respects, it's just like EQ
:)

While it bears a lot of similarity to EQ, enough to be considered
competition, I think the games are different enough that each stands
on its own. I expect I'm going to keep playing DAoC, but I'm
definitely not dumping EQ for it.

One thing that I haven't yet been able to really put my finger on is
the nagging suspicion that the DAoC designers made conscious efforts
to implement everything differently than in EQ. In cases where EQ does
something poorly, this makes sense. However, EQ does a lot of stuff
very well, and to avoid doing it in a similar fashion just to be
different doesn't really work.

And, I have to say, I don't really like the control interface for
DAoC. EQs is much cleaner and easier on the eyes.

I recommend you *try* the game, but don't cancel your EQ account
unless you find that DAoC really rings your bell.
