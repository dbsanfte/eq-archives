Just like EQ, and every other MMORPG, it depends on whether you "get into"
it.  Think about quests in EQ, or DAoC (the two MMORPGs I've played to
reasonable level (61 EQ, 50 DAoC)).  They could all be described as generic
if you want:

    1. Run around killing mobs for certain specific drops.

    2. Run around delivering things for NPCs.

    3. Turn in specific tradeskill items to NPCs.

When it comes down to it, all you really can do in any of these games is

    1. Kill things.

    2. Go to places.

    3. Talk to NPCs.

    4. Turn in items to NPCs.

    5. Make tradeskill items.

What makes a quest interesting is the presentation, not what you do.  For
example, in EQ, the Tartan's Wheel quest is basically "go to these 10
places".  What makes it interesting is how they describe the 10 places (in
cryptic poems).

Can you camp?  It occurs to me that I have never seen anything spawn in CoH.
I wonder if they have spawn code that finds locations where there are no
Heroes to spawn mobs?

This is partly because they limit the number of Heroes that can be around.
Have you ever noticed that when you zone, sometimes you are given a choice
between, say, "Atlas Park" and "Atlas Park 2"?  That's because Atlas Park
got crowded, and so the server made a new instance.
