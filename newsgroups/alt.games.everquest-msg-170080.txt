*ahem* Remember that post a bit earlier where you said you started 
ignoring CiH, even your former friends, because 'they were a part of 
it'?  Same deal.  Of course, if I play with you before I know what route 
you took, and you're doing your job, I'm not likely to even think twice 
about the route.  Hell, I take the easiest route with my rogue most of 
the time unless I can get a guild group together.  But if I've never met 
you and the first thing I hear is "they went Oasis/LOIO/OT/DL/KC", I'm 
going to be very, very, VERY careful when grouping with you for the 
first time.  Past experience, and all ;p
