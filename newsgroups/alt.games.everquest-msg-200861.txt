Similar thing here. I haven't changed anything at all on my system lately, but
EQ is crashing more frequently. Got knocked out while on one of the platforms in
Kelethin, in fact. I logged back in, planning on going to collect my corpse
(this was a level 12 alt) and found myself on the ground underneath the far side
of Kelethin with no damage, spells still memmed, and all my gear still on.
