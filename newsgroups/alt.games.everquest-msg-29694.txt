Found blue giants, did the standard root/2 dots, snare, wait untill root break, make
sure it lost at least 50% of HP on the 2 dots, then ran around and nuked it till
death. If there is an add, RUN, you cannot kill both.
Around 33 you can run a little away with the add, root it, run back, finish giant, run
to zone (or kill add if mana permits).

My wis was around 206 or so (210 now), but could end up killing 2 giants on 1 full
mana bar, so you should be able to solo them.
