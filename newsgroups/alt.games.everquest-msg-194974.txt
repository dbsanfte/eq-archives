Take your druid to SeaFury island in OOT, just south of the AC isle. SoW and
Levi yourself (I don't know if you have SoE yet,) DOT and Sea fury and pull
it to the AC isle.  One he's there root him and let your DOT's do their job.
You won't get adds on AC and the furies will still give you exp and drop
gems that you can sell for 70plat or so on a fairly regular basis
