Yup, the same trick works for other potions.  (Or at least, it did.
Now that it's being bruited about it'll probably get nerfed!)  As I'm
not yet at the point where I'm willing to eat even 122pp per dose, I
don't do it with Gate potions, but I've been using it to shave a few
plat off the cost of SOW potions.  A 10-dose SOW sells back for about
19pp regardless of the number of doses left (at least 1, of course).
So instead of paying about 7-8 per SOW (typical price is 70-80 for a
10-dose potion) I end up paying 5.5-6.5.  Sure, 1.5pp is mostly in
the noise, but it's easy enough to manage it, so why not?
