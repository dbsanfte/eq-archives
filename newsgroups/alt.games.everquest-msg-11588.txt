Sounds like we're on not discussing the same thing.  This discussion
is on tanking ability, not spellcasting, nor soloing.  Your
explanation of "Slow" falls apart when you compare apples to apples.
Shaman aren't the only ones who can Slow a mob.  So now that the
Enchanter or the other Shaman in the group has slowed the mob, can a
shaman tank the mob nearly as well as a Ranger, Rogue, Pally, or SK
would on the same slowed mob?

Bottom line is, you can't say that "Debuffing the mob" = "Tanking
ability".  Debuffing the mob in any form is still a Good Thing, but
has no relationship to "tanking ability".
