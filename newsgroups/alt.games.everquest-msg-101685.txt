Location: daylight, Mons Letalis, bloody mountainous.
Gimp: Dark blue regular pet, Aug'd and fully healed.
Chimp: In Lich form, JBoot sowed, Dead man Floating, 2/3 HP and Mana.

*Of note: the dead man floating and lich buff icons look identical*

The Chimp climbs to the top of a mountain to get a better veiw, with the
Gimp struggling along behind to keep up. He points over to a Rockgrabber in
the distance.

"There, that dark blue one, that should be worth some XP, don't taunt this
one, we'll let the DoT's do a lot of the work this time, standard kite, no
fear"

*A Gimp regards you dubiously. A frown creases his skeletal brow*

"As you wish...Oh....*grits teeth* ...Great..... *shakes uncontrollably*
.... One."

Speeding up over the hills and mountains, the Chimp makes good time but
approaches a little to close to cast Dooming Darkness and the Rockgrabber
aggros first, covering the intervening ground with remarkable speed. No time
to get Darkness off and backing up the Chimp realises the Stonegrabber is
keeping pace, so aims for the large summits and valleys to enable the
levitation effect to produce a lead. Mountain, Ravine, Mountain, Ravine,
Mountain.....

Approaching a good enough lead to get off Dooming Darkness, The Chimp spots
his 5% HP bar...

"Oh shit, the Lich!" and the Chimp makes a mad scramble to click it off.

"Master! Be careful, not the......"

"AAAAaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" *Thud*

*loading. Please wait*

"....dead man floating?"
