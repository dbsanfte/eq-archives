I think it's a shame that, aside from duelling, PvP isnt a part of the game on
most servers. I know that the red servers are mostly populated with people
there solely for people killing but its a great facet of the game lacking on
the blue servers. I think it could be effectively implemented and here are my
thoughts on how:

You cant just have people killing everybody else just because they can, there
has to be some sort of consequences for murder. I think, depending on the
person you kill, you could have massive negative faction hits for whoever they
are aligned with. And if you embark on a massive slaughter fest could earn a
reputation as an outlaw and be hunted by most, if not all of the guards in the
lands, making the idea of killing everybody you can see and thus making your
life in norrath a very restricted and unappealing one. Also, duels could stay
in place where two plyers consent to a fight, but experience loss to the player
who attacks and kills another player without first challenging. For those that
become outlaws you could have quests where their head is the bounty and this
again would encourage most to stay away from the quake style frag fest. I think
an important part of the game is missing without PvP properly implemented, we
should not all be immune to each other. And also, it would do away with
everyones pet peeve: beggars! you dont have to kill them and thus earn the bad
faction but you could smack them around enough to put them off the idea. But
then people could just beat down somebody, not kill them and just chase em
around continuing this, so maybe you could have an 'engage' button or something
whereupon you agree to fight the target and after a set time you can no longer
attack them until a suitably alotted time has passed again. 
These are by no means hole proof ideas i know, but i, for one, would like to
see PvP on all servers with the appropiate rules so it doesnt ruin the game.
