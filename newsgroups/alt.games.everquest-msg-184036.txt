Having problems getting this working with my bard.  Any suggestions are
greatly appreciated.  This is what I do.

Run by mobs until I collected 5-10.  Charm one of them.  Wait for all the
mobs to jump the pet while I have my cursor on Invis.  One problem.  No one
attacks the pet.  When I instruct the pet to attack one the mobs, it just
attacks that single one (and the mob fights back) and the rest follow me.  I
assume this is an aggro problem.  But I can't think of a less aggro way of
getting mobs than just running by them.  What am I doing wrong?

Thanks!

Rom
