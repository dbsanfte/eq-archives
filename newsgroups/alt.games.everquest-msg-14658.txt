I was right. You have ignored the fact that the Verant company policy is that
accounts are never hacked, and anyone who has an account that was hacked, well,
it just wasn't hacked. You have ignored the fact that the official company
policy is to ban anyone who even reports their account has been hacked. 

And you have ignored the fact that your tired "argument" has been said and
discussed to death over and over.

For the greater good of me, you have been sentenced to the Killfile Krew. Your
entry there improves Usenet in that there is one less person spewing willfully
ignorant messages into my view.

If you wish to develop the ability to think for yourself, think about this:

If the police stop taking reports for rapes, the number of rapes in this
country would officially fall to zero.

In the meantime...

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
