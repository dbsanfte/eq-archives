You know what? Chef is a badge of honor and distinction. I will gladly 
shake the hand of any chef I meet, as I have spent many years of my life 
cooking in middle and upper crust restaurants. It's a hard job, with a lot 
of pressure, and I have always said that if you put 100 marines and 
construction workers in the kitchen, by the end of 3 hours 99 would be 
crying for mommy.

In short: Fuck off, fuck directly off. Do not pass go, do not collect $200.
