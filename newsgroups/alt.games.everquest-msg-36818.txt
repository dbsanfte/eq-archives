Wedding and Birthday cakes are solely for roleplay purposes. If theres a guild
wedding people will want cake, and might be interested in buying. I usually make
for free if they get the materials, since I still get skills from it.
If i have some for sale i try to sell for 5pp a stack, just to make a little
money from it.

Oh, and theres probably a lot bigger market for Wedding Cake Slices than for
Birthday Cake Slices, so do NOT misread the recipe and make Birthday cake out of
39 brownie parts like i did *s*
