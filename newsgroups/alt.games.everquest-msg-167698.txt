Whine whine whine.  No, raising casting skills takes about the same time, 
the activity is just different.  Here's what you do:  Get some crappy but 
fast weapons, and a druid friend.  You don't really need the druid, but it 
helps. :)  Go out and find a blue mob that can be dragged to a relatively 
safe spot, and that runs at low health.  The druid is just there to 
refresh snare every 9 minutes while you beat it senseless.  With crappy 
enough weapons and low enough skill, you won't actually kill the mob and 
need another one for a very long time.  Congratulations!  You have 
re-created the effect of being a caster and standing in a corner doing 
something mindless and raising your skill.  In fact, you have it -better- 
than a caster... you just have to turn attack on, you don't have to click 
another spell gem every 3-5 seconds.  If you don't have the druid with ya, 
you may have to follow the mob around.  Which is about as much excitement 
as clicking 'burst of flame' over and over.

Example:  The other night I was soloing in western wastes with a 55 druid, 
and took a look at how atrocious my melee skills were.  2HB: (2), 1HS (4).  
Oyy.  So I smacked a glacier mastodon down until it was running, snared 
it, and started beating it with weapons.  45 minutes later I was still 
hitting the same mastodon in the same spot, and had gained 6 points of 
2HB, 8 points of 1HS, 1 point of Hand to Hand, and 3 points of Offense.  
I'd say that's pretty comparable to how a non-twinked caster's skills go 
up with the 'cast summon: food ad infinitum' technique.  And you don't run 
out of mana and have to stop to med.
