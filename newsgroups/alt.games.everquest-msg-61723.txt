One more time.

It has nothing to do with class.

The higher of INT or WIS is used to determine skill increases.  Some
tradeskills get an added bonus to determining skill increases from a
secondary stat.  Smithing uses STR as secondary stat, fletching and
tailoring (I think) use DEX as a secondary stat.

Chance of success is solely determined by your skill level vs the skill
level required for the item in question.
