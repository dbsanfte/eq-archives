Mobs do fall under the world or get stuck in geometry.  Check out
PoStorms for example...recent patches have reintriduced the pathing
problem there.  But that doesn't mean that a mob under the world is
there because of the same problem you are seeing.  This is evidenced
by the fact that one person sees the mob under the world and the other
5 do not, as well as the fact that this seems to happen to PC's as
well, even though they aren't actually falling under the world.  (Only
under-the-world problem I have seen lately is getting on a mount in
PoJ with my necro and backing up to a wall).
