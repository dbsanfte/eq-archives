The Cazic Thule spires are completely safe.  There are no mobs in that
room.  Getting out of that room is another story, but I considering
how few people even know that Cazic Thule HAS a wizard portal, it's
not a big deal.  If you're getting a port to CT, you either know what
to expect, or are about to learn a very valuble lesson.
The GD spires are completely safe unless you're on the wrong faction.
I have not been attacked at either of those spires.
