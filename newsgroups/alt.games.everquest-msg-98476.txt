At some point after I stopped playing my bard, they nerfed
the living bejeezus out of Lullaby and Pixie strike.  The
mobs got two resist rolls.  There was much logging by John Kim
(whose in-game name I can't remember) who was the resident
numbers fanatic.  After getting straight answers from GZ on
how the resists were supposed to work, he handed in HUGE amounts
of logged combat that showed they were absolutely, positively,
not working as intended.  It still took VI ages to partially
unnerf these two songs.  As a result, many bards who "grew
up" in that time period may not think much of their own CC
abilities (until someone shows them just how effective Song
of Twilight is).

The problem was, that the second resist roll was supposed
to be less likely to succeed as your level compared to the
mob went up - the resists actually INCREASED as you gained
levels above the mob.  One of the "fixes" was simply declaring
that Lullabye and Pixie Strike were intended to work only on
mobs up to a given level, that these songs were not intended
to be useful for the life of the bard.  Shocking news, as most
every other bard song scales with level, and remains useful
for the entirety of the bards life.

Heh, you think that's dangerous.  The first bard slow is AE.  Try
weaving CoD (2) with a lute, DDD (18) with a horn, and LMB (20)
in an all instrument attack on multiple mobs.  Between CoD and
DDD you have to switch instruments.  It's not for the faint of
heart. :)  

I first used Lullabye for CC in Splitpaw (back when the boss 
mobs were high shamans (16ish?).  Down in the commander room?
It's hard to recall the names of them now, but pretty deep in.
To get there, we would run out on the bridge and jump off.
At any rate, it's not uncrowded.
