People in my guild with the latest GF6800 can't run shadows either.
Shadows are just laggy in EQ's implementation. I dont find them too bad
in a single group but at a raid they bog me down heavily.

Having upgraded from a GF4200 to a 9800 pro quite recently I really
can't see how someone couldn't tell the difference from a GF3 card, the
performance increase over the 4200 was definately noticable, and the
4200 blew the GF3 out of the water. I can now run max fsaa and
anisotropic filtering in EQ, something the 4200 couldn't handle at all.
Outdoor zones in Luclin lost all their lag as well.
