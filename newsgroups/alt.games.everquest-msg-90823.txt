The bit where I said 'catch 99% of the problem' meant that I though it
would stop the 99% of the 'snivelling brats' (though on reflection,
99% is probably a bit optimistic!!). I concede that you will always
get a hard core of prats - the sort that mean that manufacturers of
peanuts now have to put warnings such as 'WARNING - this pack may
contain nuts'!!! on packaging.

No matter how obvious the situation is to people with half a brain
cell, or how well you elaborate/explain. You will always have a hard
core of pions who will complain/plead ignorance (sadly all too
believable in many cases!!).

So we agree? - Lets call it a deal?
Cheers
