another thing you can do is go into your video properties and turn vertical
sync to "always off" and turn anti-aliasing to "always off".  Both these
functions are complete performance hogs and you won't even notice a
difference visually with them turned off.  Well maybe a little, but you
would have to actually stop to examine something to see a real difference.
Regular game activity won't suffer.

Good luck,
Sean...
