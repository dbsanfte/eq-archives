Well, Here's the thing about the Kunark Armors.  They're strictly raw AC items,
with some mediocre spells attached.  I have a full set of Blood Ember which I
wear for the cool look, and the nice AC.  However, only the legs and BP add
stats, and not that many of them, so yes, my resists suffer for it.  It was
basically to be a choice between the AC of Kunark Armor vs Stats and Resists of
Planar gear.  I still keep my Umbral pieces in a tink bag in case I'm in need of
the boosts. However, Velious has totally thrown what was once somewhat balanced
armor sets into disarray.  I recently was awarded a 60 AC bp, which puts me
ahead of a 60 Warrior in my guild in terms of AC, and leaves me only 200 hp
behind.  And I've seen Paladins in my guild with Higher HP than most Warriors.
Although it's true that these items probably won't be obtained by enough people
to make it a balance issue, they do make an impact.
