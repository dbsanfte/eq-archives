I personally don't 'get' this. If I enjoy hotdogs, then I won't try 
hamburgers. If I enjoy playing hockey then I won't try basketball. I 
loved the original C&C so I've got no interest in the new C&C?

Its one thing to enjoy eq, to know that you enjoy eq, and to want to 
play eq.

Its something different to reject something else sight unseen simply 
because you are already having fun. I don't know about you, but for 13 
bucks a month I"m enjoying EQ too, but maybe just maybe I'll enjoy EQ2 
more. Why would I ignore it?

Almost all the half-lifers are looking forward to half-life 2, and its 
not because they're sick to death with half-life 1.
