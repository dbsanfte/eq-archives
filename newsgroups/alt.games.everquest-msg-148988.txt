Paludal Caverns is the best exp in the game at that level.   Fiends and
Sensiates (mushrooms)  will take you to level 16 or 17 when the exp starts
to drop off then its time to group and hit the bandit camps (the aggros are
just too much at times to solo).  You should be able to hit 26 in a weekend
or 3 or 4 nights if you are just playing in the evenings.

 As far ar loot is concerned, once you start hitting bandits, the armor
sells to vendors for 1-3pp, the rest is pretty much junk.
