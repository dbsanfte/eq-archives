Root doesn't do any damage, so you're in no danger of stealing the kill.
The only downside I can see: when a MoB is near death (or feared), it will
try to escape from it's attackers, giving them an opportunity to smack the
beast from behind without getting hit in return.  If you Root the beast,
it'll turn and fight to the death or until Root breaks.  Some people might
get very irritated at you for Rooting their prey.  You might have better
luck waiting until the beast is nearly dead and then finishing it off with
a small nuke, but there are still some people who will get angry over
anything.  As a wizard, you're kind of out of luck when it comes to helpful
spells... you'll get group ports, people love those.
