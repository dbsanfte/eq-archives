 Well considering that the research showed you didn't get a bonus until
you hit level 56 mobs, I'd say that '4 or so zones' is fairly accurate.

 Faction issues scratch Chardok off my list of possible destinations. My
faction isn't high enough to survive that long taking faction hits and I
dont feel like killing any more goblins.

 That sounds like pretty good xp on the Sun Revs. I've found Grey to be
pretty slow xp but never bothered with the revs.  The FG camp (I assume
you're talking about the bugs?) sounds like nice xp for a group of 60s.

 With less reward comes less desire to sit there wasting their time
regardless of how easy or not the place is.

 Shrooms seem like good xp from what I remember. Some of them channel
Complete Heal pretty well though so you really need a more traditional
group down there although I'm sure others would work. You just wouldn't
be as efficient.

 Being challenged is fine and all. But some days instead of a raid or a
challenge I just like to solo, gaining xp at my own pace and not having
to rely on other people. To have that 'nerfed' was just a bit insulting.
Sure I'd still be gaining xp but hardly in a way that needs to have a
penalty imposed upon it.

 I remember both, really. On some of the easier XP camp grinds (while
not soloing) we challenge ourselves and have fun by pulling as many mobs
as we can. And I'm not talking AE groups either. Yes, the mobs are a
little easier but we still have to work hard to come out alive. Fun is
where you find it. The problem is not everyones idea of fun (excluding
griefers) doesn't fit into the 'Vision'.

 Six to eight AA points in 12 hours sure would be nice though! I don't
think I've ever gotten more than 2 in one day before.
