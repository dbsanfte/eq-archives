Not that I would hard-code that sort of thing anyway, but assuming a
fat-fingered my copybook (yes, I said copybook ... most healthcare
organization run their AR on old software) before I recompiled, the crap I
would be in would be just as deep.  Too much or too little ... the Federal
Government really doesn't care.  They just want it right, and they'll be
quite happy to levy fines either way.

As long as the government is interested in healthcare, I'll have a job
somewhere.  And as long as there's medicare and medicaid, the government
will be interested in healthcare.

Some things are easier to track down than others.  And some things have
different priorities than others, depending on the number of hours it'll
take to fix it.

In EQ terms ... you have 3K to spend your ranger.  You can either buy a pair
of SCHWs and leave him in tattered armor, or you can upgrade a lot of your
other slots and forego the haste.

In IS terms .. resource hours == plat.
Upgrades are upgrades.
You deciding how the plat is spent == SOE management.

Are all the decisions right?  Of course not.

Again, it depends on the number of resource hours it takes to close the
loophole.  KEI is an example.  The fact that KEI could stick on lower level
characters was broken code ... when they "nerfed KEI", all they did was fix
the code so that it worked the same as all the other upper level buffs.
They knew about it for a while, but they had bigger fish to fry.
