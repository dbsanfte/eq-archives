Because that's not how you're supposed to be using it.  Or at
least, not as often as you've been using it that way.

Or maybe it means you need to stop relying on that tactic so
much.

Or maybe the uber guilds, who don't *need* to use such a lame
dodge around just fighting their way in, should consider
leaving Vox for the people who really need her.

Name one other rechargeable item that was exploited this badly.

I predict that if the "uber guilds" start trying to monopolize
Vox so that they can keep exploiting the rez stick, Verant is
going to "fuck" you further (i.e., correct the problem created
by greedy players) by making the rez stick CLR/PAL only, just
as they did when Soulfire started to be universally used as
a "CH stick" by inappropriate classes.

And I'll be first in line to suggest that to them.

I have no problem with someone using the rez stick to have,
say, a Monk rez someone, but I sure as hell have a problem
with the attitude of, "we're so fixated on that tactic
that we're going to gank Vox weekly and monopolize her
completely just so we can keep using the tactic when we're uber
enough not to even need to in the first place".

In *that* case, yeah, fuck you very much.
