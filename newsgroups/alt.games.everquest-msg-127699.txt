If you leave that song playing you can switch targets as often as you want.
In fact, I never much liked charm kiting myself either but I do use this
same tactice with mez.  If i am tanking and get an add I'll play pixie
strike on teh add and switch targets back while not recasting anysongs.

I don't have any problems with the 39 charm.  Works the same as all my other
songs do in this scenario.
