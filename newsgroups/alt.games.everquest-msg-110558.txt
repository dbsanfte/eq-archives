You don't need a guide. Go to any of the five wizzy spires that have a
Nexus Scion. (i.e. Tox, Gfey, NK, DL, and GD). Hail the Scion and tell
her/him "I wish to journey to Luclin". They will give you a shard to
hang on to. (Note: The spires are bugged, and you can sometimes be
transported to Luclin *without* a shard if you are standing under the
spires when they fire, but get one to be safe. Stay out of them at
firing time if you don't want to go.)  When they fire, you will be
transported to the Nexus on Luclin. To go to other places, just go out
one of the four exit halls from the center of the Nexus and find the
teleport pad going to the destination you want. There are usually
announcements made on each end as to when the next portal firing will
occur, but not always, so be alert. Be aware that that Vellious (GD) pad
in the Nexus is shared by two scions. I forget which one it's shared
with right now. When it fires, (no shard required on Nexus end) you will
be teleported down to the destination spires. Most of them are pretty
safe for most level players, but the Vellious one will drop you on top
of some frost giants and their wolves fairly often, so be wary. The NK
one often has a Karanas guard (Guard Frederick) patrolling under it, so
evil races should be aware of that as well. The Tox, GFey, and DL ones
are pretty much always safe. (unless something nasty get's trained to
the DL ones or guards are trained to the Gfey one which could upset the
evils.)

There is a map at http://www.eqatlas.com/ of the nexus showing which
portals go where. Print it out and you're all set.
