Well, I probably would have except at those levels I found a great way to
make lots of cash and good exp and then I was camping to get the Shield of
Bane Warding until I was 46. The levels after that just sorta zipped by in a
short time. Frankly raids are not as common here it seems, so the need for
the rez feature hasn't become critical yet. As I mentioned in another
thread, I've only seen one epic my whole time here. I'm not sorry that I no
longer have any money worries in exchange for having to solo some greens.

It looks like much of the epic involves some long camps. I'd rather solo
those than subject others to that boredom. So as long as I can get the parts
I need, I don't mind camping greens while I do other things offline at the
same time. Thanks for the information. The exp groups in SF sounds like a
great idea.

I guess this answers my question about the beginning of the quest in LRathe
too. Allakhazam says the mobs are in the 30s but the threads all talk about
people doing them in groups in their mid-50s so I was doubting if they are
soloable.
