IMHO:

1.  Creeping Crud
2.  Ensnaring Roots
3.  Skin Like Steel
4.  Wolfform
5.  Charm Animals
6.  Dismiss Summoned
7.  Resist Fire
8.  Pogonip
9.  Sunbeam
10. Spirit of Cheetah

This is from a solo druid point of view.  Depending on your play style
you might even want to flip Wolfform and Charm animals.
