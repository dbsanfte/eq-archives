Fixing the problem does not necessarily mean eliminating twinking.  It may
just mean keeping it to a reasonable level as a whole.  If they really
wanted to end twinking, then simply making all loot no drop would accomplish
that goal.

Here's A Question of Balance (with apologies to the Moody Blues).  The
economy on the Raith allows me to purchase Deepwater armour at about the
same level that I should be questing Ro armour.  Does this ability to buy
armour above my level (based on the level needed to reasonably be able to
quest it) count as twinking, even indirectly?

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
