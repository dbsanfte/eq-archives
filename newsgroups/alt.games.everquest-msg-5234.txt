Has anyone worked out what to do with the encrypted document dropped by
the Kobold missionary in Steamfont yet? Seems this quest was added with
the addition of the Warrens and web spoilers are thin on the ground.
Best I could come up with was that someone had cast identify on it and
it identifies as the 'Doctrine of Rolfron Zek' or somesuch.

Killing the missionary gets you the same faction hits as kobolds on Tox
and the Warrens (+Erudin and Heretics, -Clan Kolbok), so I would guess
that someone in Erudin or Paineel wants him dead. Lots of asking around
in Erudin hasn't turned up any leads, and I'm thinking that maybe you
don't get told about the quest until you've completed a prior, lower
level, kobold related quest - anyone have any ideas?
