Dueling is fun!  That's it, that's all, people like to kill time by fighting
in the arena or what-not.

I used to have fun dueling with a ranger friend of mine.  As a cleric, I'd
own her because I'd blind her, root her, and nuke her.  Finally, though, she
got her resists up and started owning me.  Darned resist gear!

It means nothing, it's just a way to have fun.  It's only fools who allows
themselves to get all worked up over it and yell and scream when they lose.

There are a couple of legitimate game tactics that involve dueling.  One if
long-term storage of no-rent items.  Swirling Shadows used to be no-rent,
and are a component to making Shadowscream armor.  So if you wanted to skill
up using Shadowscream, you had to collect all the other ingredients first
(not at all easy, involves much farming), then, in one session, you had to
kill a bunch of shades and grab as many Swirling Shadows as you could, then
combine them into Shadowscream.  It was annoying, and the way people worked
around that was to farm Swirling Shadows, then fill themselves up with bags
of Swirling Shadows and find someone to kill them.  Now they could log off
in comfort, since their corpse would be holding the no-rent Swirling
Shadows, to be looted at their convenience.  The only thing you had to be
careful of is not to let the corpse poof a week later.  (Swirling Shadows
were recently changed to no longer be no-rent, much to the joy of
blacksmiths everywhere.)

The other tactic, one which is somewhat common even amongst the upper-most
raiding guilds, is for people who arrive late to a raid.  For example,
earlier this week I arrived late to a Rallos Zek raid, and I was at the zone
line while people were just getting ready to engage Tallon Zek.  There were
mobs between me and the raid, and the mobs could see invisible.  Call of the
Hero is disabled where we were, as it is in many high-end zones.  So the
only way for me to join was to have a rogue come and duel me.  I let him
kill me, then he dragged my corpse to the raid, using Shroud of Stealth to
get past even see-invisible mobs.  I was rezzed, and voila!  I got to be
part of our RZtW kill.

So there ya go, a couple of examples of useful applications for dueling.

But, mostly, it's just for fun.  Try it sometime.  =)
