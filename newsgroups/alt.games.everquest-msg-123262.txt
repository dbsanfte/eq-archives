Hey I know that guy! 
"Nobody pays more than 15gp for a Platinum Ruby Veil." 
"What? A Stien of Maggok is only worth 70PP"
"I wont take less than 50pp for the HQ bear"
"I am not paying 50pp for a 10 slot BP"

bozo: "This is a rusty, don't you have anything better?"

They are free when you kill the correct Centurion. Whats wrong with
you? You got it without having to spend anything! Why can't you just

(SARCASM OFF)(Man I hate that saying)

which flies in the face of "Need before Greed"
