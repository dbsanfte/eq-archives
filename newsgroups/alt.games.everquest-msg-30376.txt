Well, this happened for us right as our Hate group had finished buffing for
the Maestro.   People in zone went immediately from 47 to 20, including 3 of
my 5 group members.

If the pull team cleric hadn't been a little low on mana and asked for a
moment to meditate, we would have been in mid Maestro pull....

Actually it was pretty frustrating there for a moment, thinking that we were
going to have to stick around, wait for everyone to get back, and then fight
the Maestro... since our guild was kind of in a hurry.   But the raid was
called off shortly afterwards, rather than risk everyone on uncertain
connections.

As for why we were in a hurry...  Right before the mass LD, we had just
recieved word that of all things, *Ragefire* was up and uncamped.

So, anyways, our guild now has its first Noodle equipped cleric. ; )
