DAoC online is typically 1/4-1/3 EQ online, which is what it has been
from pretty much day 1.  (I'm only counting the US servers for DAoC).

So, the question is, where did those people come from?  Did they come
from other games, or was there a large number of people who wanted to
play an MMORPG but for some reason were not interested in the existing
games?
