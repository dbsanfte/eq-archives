Umm no.  You wanna see agro?  Use tash to pull a mob.  Use slow to pull a
mob.  Use a 800dd nuke/stun to pull,  that will beat your agro hands down

Why aren't bards pullers?  Having add's is the same problem that non FD
classes get who are usually expected to pull (warriors, paladins, rangers
etc..)  you even have the advantage of outrunning a lot of mobs, and kiting
a lot of stuff around.

Tell the bards who regularly pull PoG that bards aren't, or can't pull
