Either right click and hold, or shift+left click.

Actually, they're only stat foods if you bake them a certain way.  The 
sandwiches, which are the easiest, give no stats.  The steaks give a bit 
of a stat, and the beer braised even more, but of course, trivials go 
up.  Not to mention that they also give -1 int.  Okay for a necro if 
they're low enough to be still meleeing but kinda silly once they're 
doing their necro-y thing.

I seem to recall someone saying milk and water lasted the same time, and 
to buy milk because it was cheaper.  I cannot, however, guarantee it.
