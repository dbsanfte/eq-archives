Yep, I put a point in there despite having Tboots... innate running
never gets dispelled, never has to be cast, works if I'm dead... works
indoors..

I still Tboot cause its faster, and I still take SOW cause its faster still...
but I'm -never- slower than normal mobs anymore.

One point is all I'm doing for now, as leveling up seems far more
important.. but "faster than whats chasing me, always" seemed
worth taking a couple days at 90% AA.

Eventually I'll dump two more in, but "a little -more- faster
than those mobs" isn't anywhere near as high a priority... only
going with it cause it seems more useful than all the other
alternatives.  What to do with the other three points I"ll need
to amass before I can start getting mana regen I don't know.
