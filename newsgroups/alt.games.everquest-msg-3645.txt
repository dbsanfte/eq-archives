Here is how I am set up at home (a few rants along the way)

Cable Modem (one that RoadRunner forces on us since there is no discount for
owning one)
|
LinkSys BEFSR11 - EtherFast 1-Port Cable/DSL Router
|
LinkSys 10/100 16 port hub
|    |    |
|    |    Computer running Windows ME sole purpose to play MP3's for me
|    Computer running Windows 2k
Computer running Windows 2k

I actually have a number of other devices on the hub, but that is pretty
much what you are asking.

Some caveats for anyone who has read this far. I run Microsoft's game voice
in this same environment by opening lots of ports to the single machine that
has the game voice (only needed if you are going to be the server). You may
want to use a switch instead of a hub if you are doing lots of copying of
files around your network (I went with the hub because when I got it, it was
more than 50% cheaper).

I am using the defaults for all the networking settings. At one point I had
an ISDN router that replaced the cable modem and the BEFSR11.

Other possible solutions are as follows.

hub/router
|    |
|    Computer 1 with modem conencted to internet with connection sharing
(Windows ME or 2K)
computer 2 using computer 1's connection

This will work, and people have had luck with 56K connections. Most areas in
the US do have some form of broadband connection available and that is the
best option.

Hope that helps.
