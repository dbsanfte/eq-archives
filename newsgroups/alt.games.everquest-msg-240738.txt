True...but with the new options of enchanted velium bits and ldon
armor you can get to 222 much quicker. You can wash bp's for aid
grimel until 227 if you are a gating class or have the patience to run
back and forth from grimel to forge. After that, Shadowscream is
probably best option. And even with an AE nuker in HM.. its still
extremely time consuming.
