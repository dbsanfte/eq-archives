Sorry that we got off on a largely bad foot this last week. I think we both
reacted rather emotionally instead of trying to take a relaxed approach.

There is a significant problem with counter agents being distributed to the
public after coming to some understandings I have learned about.

Many of the fatalities in Desert Storm (non coalition) were due to people
freaking out, suspecting exposure, using counter agents, and dying from them
becuase they were not exposed or having a bad dose of bad counter agent.
