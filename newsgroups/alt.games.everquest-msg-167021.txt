Was already to tell you and then finished reading...you were
there....splitpaw ent.  Great exp at your level and the looted weapons
are worth 4 to 6 play each.     If you really dont like SK, and have
Luclin, you might consider MSeru.  Most stuff there cons indifferent
to even you, which means you can hunt faily safely there and get good
exp..no real loot though.   If you want big bucks and exp, get a group
the same or alittle higher than your level and go to the GE entrance
in Dawnshroud and gang up on tribals.  Good exp and some of them drop
acrylia, which sells from 40 to 70 plat each.  Don't even consider
stepping into DS at your level without a group though.   Bind in the
Nexus no matter which of these three you choose, get C3 and head
out.....IMHO  :)
