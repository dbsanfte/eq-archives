My BF has bad eyesight and dyslexia.  This is not a problem when we are playing
together, as I see messages intended for him: "haste please", that sort of
thing.  Now that we aren't playing together as much it's affecting his
gameplay.  Is there any way to make the fonts BIGGEST and tells to him THE MOST
NOTICABLE??
