It is not necessary to Succor to cross SG.  I can assure you a cleric
can't succor, yet I've done it more than once, without anyone casting
any spell whatsoever on me.  Mind you I did need an invis potion
to get -to- the zone in to SG, and I have a staff which gives me
permanent EB.

Still, if you can get -to- SG, then you can get to WW, even if
you are a level one warrior, without any help at all... other
than being twinked with the knowledge of how to do it.

But its a secret.
