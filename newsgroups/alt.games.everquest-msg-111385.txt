Thanks..."radioactive" is what I meant.

Yes, most of the bugs were fixed, but this is exactly the reason that the
items
were tagged this way.  It is STILL possible to kill a LD player or even LD
guide/
GM.  If you kill him when the game flags him as a NPC, you can loot his
stuff.

This used to happen also when folks would kill themselves, delete
themselves,
make a new char with the same name, and loot all their uber gear, even the
NO DROP stuff.  Many of these types of 'sploits were and have been fixed,
but
who knows what bugs will crop up?

And I HAVE seen a GM die before.  Waaaay back when Valtron was EMarr's GM,
he came to reset HighKeep as the guards were all trained down to the raider
room
and wouldn't path back upstairs.  He was just going to kill Captain Bosec,
but a
shaman-type goblin hit him with a DoT right before he LD'd (and he was down
in
health from killing the other guards and the Captain).  The DoT killed him,
and his
corpse was lootable.  He didn't drop anything good.
:-)

Anyways, it's not commen like it used to be...but then again, lots of bugs
have
been fixed in 3 years....
:-)
