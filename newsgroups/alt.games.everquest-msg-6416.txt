Ahh you must learn the wonders of the temple of Cazic Thule.  The exp
= Amazing.  The loot is awesome.  I am lvl 33 and i get 1 orange per
hour and about 150 pp per day (about 3 hours - 5 hours of play) and
there is loot there to sell for even more cash. (Specifically
Ravenscale which rogues need, and lizardscale stuff which lots of
people use).  This has been my home since lvl 27 and I dont see myself
leaving anytime soon.
