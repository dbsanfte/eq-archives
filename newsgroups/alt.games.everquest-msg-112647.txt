I bought a lot of this by accident, because i read that you can buy this for
plate mail, rather than painfully turning ore into medium quality folded
sheet metal. As a result, my money is tied up in the stuff. However, i find
it doesn't work in the recipes, and i can't find any way to turn it into
folded sheet metal.

Does anyone know any recipe for medium quality sheet metal? It's a very
expensive mistake if i have to sell it back to the vendor; don't know why
you lose so much reselling the same item (with high char and faction), but
thats verant for you.

If there's a way to fold it, i'd love to know.
