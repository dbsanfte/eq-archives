IT'S SIMPLE AND IT'S LEGAL!!!!!!! I found this on a bulletin board and
decided to try it a little while back, I was browsing through news
groups just as you are right now and came across a article similar to
this saying that you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with
only an initial investment of $6.00!! So, I thought yeah right. This
must be a scam, but like most of us, I as curious, so I kept reading.
Anyway, it said that you send one dollar to each of the six names and
addresses stated in the article. You then delete the first address and
change the numbers. ( 2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2, etc.) place your own
name and address on the bottom of the list at number 6 and post the
article to at least 200 newsgroups. (there are thousands) No catch
that was it. Therefore, after talking to a few people and thinking it
over I decided to try it. What do I have to lose except 6 stamps and
$6.00 right? Then I invested the measly six dollars. WELL GUESS
WHAT!!! Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail!!! I was
shocked. I thought it was going to stop but it just kept coming. In my
first week, I made $25.00. By the end of the second week, I had
$900.00. In the end of the third week, I made $5,000.00!!! It's still
growing right now. This is now my fourth week and I have made a total
of just over $38,000.00! Moreover, it's still coming in rapidly. This
is certainly worth $6.00 and 6 stamps. I have spent more than that on
the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most importantly why
it works&#8230;Also make sure that you print a copy of this article
NOW so you can get the information off of it as you need it. I promise
you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start
making more money than you possibly thought just by doing something so
easy!! SUGGESTION: READ THIS ENTIRE MESSAGE CAREFULLY (Print it out or
down load it) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come
in! It's easy. It's legal. And your investment is only $6.00 (plus
postage) IMPORTANT: This is not a rip off; it is not indecent; it is
not illegal; and it is virtually no risk - it really works!!!!! If all
of the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive
extraordinary dividends. PLEASE NOTE: please follow these directions
exactly and $50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 days. This
program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the
participants. Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the
instructions. You will now become a part of the mail order business.
In this business, your product is not solid and tangible, it's a
service. You are in the business of developing a mailing list. Many
large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality list.
However, the money made from the mailing list is secondary to the
income, which is made from people like you and me asking to be
included to that list. Here are the four steps to success: STEP 1: Get
6 separate pieces of paper write the following on each piece of paper
"PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now get 6 us 1dollar bills and
place ONE inside EACH of the six pieces of paper so the bill will not
be seen through the envelope to prevent thievery. Next, place one
paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. MAKE SURE THERE ARE
ENOUGH STAMPS ON YOUR ENVELOPES. You should now have 6 sealed
envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase your
name and address and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a
service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate
service and you are paying for it! Like most of us, I was a little
skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So,
I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they
confirmed that it is indeed legal!!!!! Mail the six envelopes to the
following addresses. #1) Matt Snodgrass 2115 S.Osage
Bartlesville,Ok.74003 #2) Mike Gordon 204 South Maple St.
Winchester,KY.40391 #3) Jeff Waldrop 39-A Lucy Rd. Laurel,MS.39443 #4)
Brian Thompson 15 Briggs Pond Wy. Sharon, MA 02067 #5)Rupert
Sprigsteen 2103 E. Pine St. Tucson, AZ  85706 #6)Mark Finch 4909 S.
Cherry Ave. Tucson, AZ  8706 STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list
that you see above, move the other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4,
etc&#8230;) and add YOUR name as number 6 on the list. STEP 3: Change
anything you need to but try to keep this article as original as
possible. Now post your amended article to at least 200 news groups. (
I think there are 24,000 groups) All you need is 200, but remember,
the more you post , the more money you make!** EVERYBODY AROUND THE
WORLD CAN DO THIS BUT REMEMBER TO PUT ENOUGH STAMPS ON YOUR
ENVELOPES!!!!** This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer
to title 18 sec. 1302 & 1341 of the postal lottery laws. Keep a copy
of these steps for your self and whenever you need money, you can use
it again and again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains
successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants
and by carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way, if
you are of integrity, the program will continue and the money that so
many others have received will come your way. NOTE: You may want to
retain every name and address sent to you, on either a computer or a
hard copy and keep the notes people sent you. This verifies that you
are truly providing a service. (Remember to wrap the $1 bill in the
note to prevent mail theft.) So, as each post is downloaded and the
directions carefully followed, six members will be reimbursed for
their participation as a list developer with one dollar each. Your
name will move up the list geometrically so that when your name
reaches the #1 spot you will be receiving thousands of dollars in
CASH!!!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1 for each of the six
people listed above) Send it now, add your own name to the list and
you're in business! DIRECTIONS: HOW TO POST TO NEWS GROUPS STEP 1: You
do not need to retype this entire letter to do your own posting.
Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your
cursor to the bottom of this document, and select "copy" from the edit
menu. This will copy the entire letter into the computer's memory.
STEP 2: Open a blank notepad file and place your cursor at the top of
the blank page. From the edit menu, select "paste." This will paste
the copy of the letter into notepad so you can add your name to the
list. STEP 3: Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want
to do your postings in different settings , you'll always have this
file to come back to. STEP 4: Use Netscape and Internet Explorer and
try searching for various news groups (on-line forums, message boards,
chat sites, discussions.) STEP 5: Visit these message boards and post
this article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter
and selecting "paste" from the edit menu. Fill in the subject, this
will be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list
of postings in a particular group, click the post message button.
You're done with the first one! CONGRATULATIONS,&#8230;THAT'S IT! All
you have to do is jump to different news groups and post away, after
you get the hang of it, it will take 30 seconds for each newsgroup!
**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN (MESSAGE BOARDS ETC.) THE
MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200.
That's it! You will begin receiving money from around the world within
days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O. Box due to the large
amount of mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you
can invent a name to use as long as the postman will deliver it.
**JUST MAKE SURE THE ADDRESS IS CORRECT** Let me break it down, say I
receive only 5 replies, so then I made $5 with my name at #6 on the
letter. Now each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1 made the MINIMUM
200 postings, each with my name at #5 and only 5 people respond to the
original 5 people. That is another $25 for me. Now those 25 people
make the MINIMUM 200 post with my name at number 4 and only 5 replies
each, I will make $125. Now, those 125 people post the MINIMUM 200
postings with my name at #3 and only get 5 replies each, I will make
an additional $626! Ok, now here's the fun part each of those 625
people post a MINIMUM 200 with my name at #2 ant they only get 5
replies that just made me $3,125!!! Those 3125 people send a MINIMUM
200 postings and they only get 5 replies each with my name at #1, I
will receive $15,625!!! With an original investment of $6!!!!
AMAZING!!!! . When your name is no longer on the list, you just take
the latest postings in the news groups and send out another $6 to
names on the list putting yourself at #6 and start posting again.
Thousands of people are joining the internet each day and they are
reading articles like these just as you are right now. So this can
never be played out just keep it going and you can make tons of money
too!!!! Please try it now and make big bucks in a few short
weeks!!!!!!
