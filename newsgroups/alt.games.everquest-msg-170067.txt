If you were around in those "old days" too, you would already know just HOW
much easier 1-50 is now

An even easier fix - pick 1 char and stick with it if you want to be 50+

I think the early levels are a complete joke now, your protected in so many
ways.. wheres the sense of excitement and danger?
The epic struggle at times (level 30!) and real leveling goals (hitting 35
was such a milestone to lose that damn spell book)

I can level from 1-50 in a matter of days.. I know, I've done it
repeatedly.. and thats without spending thousands of plat on twink gear
