For some reason, the Tracking issue seems to bring back all of Dennis'
old pre-Kunark Ranger angst.  And his Kunark Ranger angst.  And his
milder but still substantial Velious Ranger angst.  I don't know what
it is about tracking in particular, he's really mellowed tremendously
since the old days on other topics.  Something to do with EQ and AM3
I think...

P.S.  Actually, I'm exagerating a bit.  The post you replied to was only
a faded echo of the archetypical BitterRanger[tm] Dennis used to be.
