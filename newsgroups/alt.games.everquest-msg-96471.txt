I don't know.  Maybe it's just the fact that human nature is resistant
to change, but all these changes at once scare me a little.  If the
rumors are true, I get the feeling that they're trying to change too
much, too fast.  Maybe I just follow the theory, if it ain't broke,
don't fix it.  And yes, I know there are problems with EQ, but I'm
thinking there are other problems they can focus on, other than these. 
Verant has shown some their ability to create more problems with
changes, what new problems will crop up with all these massive changes
at once?
