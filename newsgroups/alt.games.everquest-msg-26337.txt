I do believe the cardholder is considered the account holder. *shrug*
Dropping an email to the original email address in the user info could
help. I seriously doubt the seller would give a rat's ass whether the
account gets canceled or not after the transaction is complete, and
therefore would go through no extra effort to see that they buyer
doesn't end up losing the account by responding to the email.
