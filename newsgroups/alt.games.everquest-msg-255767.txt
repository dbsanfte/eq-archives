I've been spending my points on training Kick on my berserker, on the 
vague theory that this skill is perhaps used as part of the intimidate 
check.

Last night I was in a group where we wanted the ranger to tank, but I 
kept pulling aggro off him using Frenzy, and my jolt axes every 12 
seconds weren't cutting it, so I had to lay off the Frenzy button. 
After a few rounds of this, I realized that one reason I'd stopped 
actually using kick was that its on the same timer as Frenzy which does 
about 100 times more damage... so I dragged out the old Kick button and 
substituted it for my Intimidate key (which also wasn't usable in our 
situation)

Clicked Kick constantly during most of the fights for the rest of the 
night, got exactly one skill up, to 117.

Using your formula I can now determine that this saved me 12250.43 
copper, or just over 12 pp.

Seems accurate, as I paid that much and more for each of the 20 training 
points I later went and spent at the trainer on raising the skill to its 
current lofty 137.

What I need is someone who has a berserker and has raised his intimidate 
up to my levels but -hasn't- raised kick, so we can parse success rates 
and try and see if the skill is making any difference.  Probably not, 
but I'm proud to be the one who's wasted hundreds of pp and a hundred or 
so training points in order to find out.
