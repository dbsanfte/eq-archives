At least in the case of our provider, I think that many ISP's simply
don't put any priority on their investments to offer news service
anymore. They all worry about pipeline speed, web page hosting space,
firewall services, etc. but it seems as if their NNTP server is almost
an afterthought. Crappiest piece of hardware they can jam into that
slot, virtually no people assigned to handle issues, and probably none
left that are that familiar with all the ins and outs of hosting an NNTP
server. It may be seen as a dinosaur by some newer ISPs and they simply
aren't putting the time, money, or effort into providing top quality
service in this area. Sucks, really, as I've been enjoying the free
speech and exchange of unfiltered ideas that Usenet provides for nearly
a decade now. I'd hate to see it go away or fall into disuse.
