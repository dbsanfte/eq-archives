    Silence. So instead of having some signal:noise here, just let it be
noise. Lovely sentiment.

    Naw.... too easy to cheap shot. Moving on. ;-)

    Hmm? Changes to items went in, what, two patches ago (not counting
emergency patches, emergency emergency patches, etc) ? I mean this is one of
the first questions most people had when SoL was announced: what will the
new class be like? Well, now we know in part - we have an equipment list for
them. If somebody wanted to make a twink BST first day of release, they can
start gathering stuff now BEFORE prices spike with demand. Or they can plain
try and assemble the stuff in the case of the high-end monk only Velious
tailored armour (which is also tagged BST now).

    Is that the concern of a twenty-hour per day player? For a few, yeah -
they'll be the ones being PLed to 60 ASAP by their guilds, to see what an
end-game BST can do. But you know who makes up the majority of the dabblers
on opening day? If Kunark was a good guide, it's the casual players who want
to try something new and low-level. And I'm sure they'd like to know that,
for example, it looks like Vah'Shir can be bards based on Lambent having VAH
added to the races allowed.

    Yes, they will. But it won't happen all during the one patch on release
day. Things are happening now, and it would be nice to find information on
what's being done in one place for easy reference. If people also want to
speculate based on that info, hey, great, whatever floats their boat. But to
say we shouldn't even try to gather facts because things might change?
Bizarre.

    More productive than making "RTFM" flames at posters which don't deter
those sorts of posters from doing it again. Or posting ad nauseum on the
completely off-topic garbage we get spammed with, which again does NOTHING
to reduce noise and does everything to generate it.
