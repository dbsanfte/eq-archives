Just to clarify: On the key set on the bottom right, under the skills tab,
right clicking on the button you want to change, should bring up a menu of
skills you can change it to. I don't think this works on the Hotkey button
if it's dragged over to the left hotkey pad, but I haven't tried that.

I haven't done this in a while, but I know it worked the last time I tried
it.

Good Luck,
Naphtoe
