Ok, but what about the rest of us, those who are neither assholes nor
jesters?  those who have an irregular playing schedule?  those who
play melees and don't have a second machine/account with a druidservant?
druids and wizards who <want> to group?  If it wasn't so damned easy
to make an effective "bot" in this game I expect that it'd be a whole
lot easier for those of us in the "solo, but <not> by choice" category
to find groups.  Not that there's a snowball's chance in hell that <any>
MM game run for a profit will place any meaningful hurdles in the way of
players who want to have bots, that'd be stupid from a business point of
view as bot accounts pay the same monthly fee (and doubtless generate
little if any additional CS overhead).
