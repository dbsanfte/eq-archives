OK, so 21 AC doesn't really suck so bad.  But no mana, no
wis, frankly it isn't something I'll ever wear.  And effect Yaulp II?
What a JOKE!  OK, up to level 44 I actually did a lot of melee,
and this might have been marginally handy... except that Yaulp
bounces off the far superior Armor of Protection (or talisman line
for that matter)

By the time you can waltz into Seb to pick this up, though, you
are -well- beyond the point where you can hold up your end
of the Melee stick.  Heck, most clerics I know think this point
is reached at around 19th.

Yaulp is a paladin spell line, included in the cleric book just to
tease us.  Putting it on a cleric only item at this high a level
is almost as much an insult as are the stats of the cleric gold
armors... only worthwhile item in that set is the bracers.  Why
am I a walking mishmosh of leather look, chain look, and
various plate look colors?  Because so far there simply -is-
no set that has wis and or mana on every piece.
