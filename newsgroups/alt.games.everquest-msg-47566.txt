Simple answer: make 2 friends. Assuming you'd want to start on Faydwer (dwarf
war, rogue, and cleric, or high elf cleric and high  elf enchaner) you could
also have a gnome wizard and wood elf druid. All of these races would start in
close proximity, and you'd have a well balanced group. The Raid Main-Assist
group as it were =)
