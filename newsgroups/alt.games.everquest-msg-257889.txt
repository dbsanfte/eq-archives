But a temp from your local 44 cleric will last a lot less time than one 
from that 65 cleric with full AA's and some really nice buff extender 
gear.  Given that both cost 1 peridot, why get the short duration one?

I'd like to answer that by saying that A) there's travel time 
subtracting from the extension, and B) if you're only paying the 
streetwalker cleric in POK a peridot then you're not really paying them 
anything at all, which probably discourages them from helping people out 
in this way in the future, while if you pay your group cleric more than 
the cost of a 'dot I'd be very surprised indeed.

Given that I always spent at least 20pp on a temp, getting one from the 
cleric in my group means that the duration can be -half- as long for the 
same cash outlay, cause I can afford two in a row.

And if one gets dispelled, then no matter what the theoretical extension 
was on the buff, they both lasted the same amount of play time (the 
extended one -did- last longer, by the amount of time it took me to run 
over from POK)... reminding me of the question "how long does an 
extended Temp last?  One, Two, Three (zoning please wait)... Three 
mobs." we used to ask each other before they put the visible buff 
duration remaining tag in.
