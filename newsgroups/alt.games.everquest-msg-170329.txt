I had some problems with this myself for a couple of minutes before i
figured it out.. There is one box with a message about how to report bugs,
that is NOT where you type in your bugdescription.. Expand the window (Drag
it, so it becomes larger) And you see a second, empty box, for typing in
your bug description..
