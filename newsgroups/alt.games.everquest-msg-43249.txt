It's the last, and most drastic thing to do.

IIRC this is the way to replace a Voodoo card:

Set your video card driver to "standard VGA" or whatever it is caled (640x480x16
colours) and running the 3Dfx utility to scan for obsolete/duplicate files, then
removing the files listed as being in the right place (being in VGA mode your
system should not balk at removing them, as they are unused).

Now shut off the system and remove the Voodoo5 (although it is a nice card for
EQ, as the game was originally written for GLide), and replace it with the
GeForce and load its included drivers. After testing it with EQ, if everything
goes well, then try the latest Detonators for better performance.

This should fix your problem without having to resort to a reformat/rebuild.
