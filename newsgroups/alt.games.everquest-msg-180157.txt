Apparently there is a "Dark" Elf from Celtic lore that was called Drau or
some such but this is more like another name for a goblin rather than the
Dark Elf/Drow/Teir'dal race of D&D and the like. This was brought up when I
said, as you thought, that Drow was an invention of a roleplayer/TSR
employee. What Drow/Dark Elves/Teir'Dal are not are Black elves due to
climate, they are Black/Blue in tone not dark skinned (except on one Elmore
painting of Drizzt) in fact in other fantasy RPG's Dark Elves are pale
skinned due to their choice of locale, not much sun underground.
As for Dark Skinned elves, seem to remember something mentioned in a
Dragonlance novel (does that franchise come under "lore?") somewhere of a
race that were dark skinned because of the climate but not seen much else.
In most cases elves are always written as living in similar areas that are
(european) forest rather than jungle climate and are therefore white,
obviously  this stems from a rather racist and out dated view point that
elves are beautiful and therefore must be white/fair whereas more
contemporary, fantasy, works have portrayed dark skinned elves making the
race as diverse as humans.  As for the rest of D'Lo's post looks more like
someone wanting to be offended rather than someone actually offended, see it
all too often.

The real reason there is no variation of skin tone to races in EQ is to
remove some/most of the oppotunity for racism in the game. Any racism in
game should be kept to in character, assling, inkie, dorf etc and not
brought from RL into game.
I would like to see different skin tone for the Human race (I think Erudite
and Barbarian should remain as are) but knowing the maturity level of some
of the player base I, sadly, understand why it is likely never to happen.
