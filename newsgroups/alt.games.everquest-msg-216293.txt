You've really hit on the key here:  The core of my usual group is
a 65 ranger/65 cleric (2box) who is a RL friend (I introduced him
to EQ many moons ago), me (65 mage) and a 65 druid.  The 4 of us
have put in tremendous time together since our early 40's in SolB;
we're willing to try insane things, and often succeed.

Before our usual raid yesterday we picked up a total of 15 people
from the guild and went after the boss in Ice tower in BoT.  Just
couldn't quite take him - we had no shaman and the only enchanter
got resisted (by her count) 29 times on slow.  The last person got
summoned and died with the mob at 2%.  It's that sort of thing that
we really like to try - taking down mobs with a minimal force.

As a result of all this, we work well together.
