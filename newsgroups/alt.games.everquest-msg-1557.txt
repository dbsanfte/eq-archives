how twinked are you talking here? If you're talking about basic stuff,
can't go wrong with Stein of Mogguk in main and Crude Stein in offhand
(+10 int / +15 cha) - my 41 enchanter still uses these. You could also
get the enchanter wands, one adds cha. Personally, I never thought they
were worth bothering with (the wand that adds cha adds less than a Crude
Stein).

I can give you a list of cheap, easy to acquire items that enables my
high elf enchanter (base cha 95, base int 127) to have mid 190's int as
needed or mid 190's cha as needed.

- obviously, the best robe you can acquire
- gatorscale sleeves for int
- drake-hide leggings for cha (or those shardwurm leggings for some
+int)
- incandescent gloves for cha and +3 mana! woo!
- incandescent mask for +cha and +int
- runed circlet for int
- cinched cord belt for int
- golden sapphire earrings for int/str, and oppaline earings for cha
- plat sapphire (I guess velium now) necklace for int/str
- polished bone bracers for int/ac, golden cat's eye agate bracers for
cha
- plat (velium) rose quartz rings for int, electrum star ruby rings for
cha
- sarnak ceremonial dagger in range slot for int

With my own +cha/int buffs, and carrying 2 sets of equip around, I can
either be around (these are approximations, havent played my enchanter
in a bit) 150cha/196int or 192cha/170 int. Either way, I have never had
problems.

As high as you can get, without sacrificing too much int. I haven't ever
seen any concrete, analytical studies on ranges of cha and what impact
they have on spells; as far as I know, it's all speculation mixed with
vague hints from Verant. Still, if I know I am going to only be there to
mezz, I'll swap in my cha gear (still having a high int). Just don't
sacrifice to much int for cha - after all, your mana *is* based on your
int, so more int = more mana = more spells = more chances to mezz.

Well, dunno what your starting stats were, but keep in mind it is
really, really easy and cheap to raise charisma, whereas it is not for
intelligence. Plus you get charisma buffs relatively early; int buffs
don't come til much later.

easier compared to what? Dunno... but erm, hmm. I guess the shammie and
pet could whittle something down, then you mem blur it, and then kill
it. One thing though, your skills might not be 0, and I know you know
how to play the game in general, but unless you're in groups at the
levels where it doesn't hurt to die, how are you going to learn how to
mezz? I mean, I guess you could powerlevel to 45, then head to some high
level dungeon, and *then* start your mezzing education, but that sounds
painful. Oh well, you're gonna do what you're gonna do.

no idea.

the incandescant quests are good ones.
