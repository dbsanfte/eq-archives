I hate PP and don't see any valid reason for it in EQ. At least, not unless
you are not allowed to PP off a mob that hasn't been aggroed. Nothing worse
than fighting a HG and nearly dying, using all your mana, only to have a
rogue run up and steal all your reward away. Sure, you can put him on
ignore, but how many rogues are their versus the number of slots in ignore?

This is, to me, one of the reasons I mostly play in zones with few other
players. i can't stand the kill stealing, people stealing my pulls
(especially quadding, because i've already hurt the beastie) and general
idiocy... eg ogres going afk in a passage blocking access, or idiots making
train after in train in Paw, because they just can't can't accept that the
magically buffed beasts are so much tougher than they con (so that  paw
beyond the doors doesn't interest me) ... but to have idiocy incorporated in
the codes of the rules... really makes me MAD!

Huff. Puff. Pahhhhhh.
