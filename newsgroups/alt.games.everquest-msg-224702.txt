> I think our puller was overly aggressive with his lulling...

Hmm, that's one think that I'll have to work with with my Pally.  Only
level 31 on that toon at the moment so I've got a little time (LDoN at
that level is so easy you can get away with a lot of mistakes).  I
created him when I saw how effective it could be and am still getting
it out of my system.

Think we've all been there ... had a group where the only way we knew
that a combat had started was by watching the puller's (in this case
the MT as well) health bar to see it go down and then try and find her
8(

How hard can it be to define a single key to say "Bringing a %t to the
party" or somesuch for that?  Regularly I find that I'm constantly
scanning around for the next mob because the puller doesn't have (and
doesn't see the need for) this.

These pulling lines often crack me up as well ... there are a lot of
witty people out there!

Cheers
