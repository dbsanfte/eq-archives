I would tend to agree that someone who would complain if their own names
were petitioned and admits that they are in violation but Continues to
whinge about others minor violations Is at the height of hypocrisy.

This one I recognize and I like it.  Cute.  I played Adventure too. And
My guess is that it is Obscure enough(these days) to Make it legal. 
Now  the Xyzzy I saw the other day.  I thought about petitioning but
realized that Unless I got a GM no-one would know what I was talking
about.

I would think about that one... Tempted to Petition If I saw it live.

Its clever enough to stay like Crisanthemum
