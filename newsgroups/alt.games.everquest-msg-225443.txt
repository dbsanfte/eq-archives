I did an LDON group tonight with my 56 enchanter.  Our lowest was 55,
highest 57, very narrow spread there.  We did a slaughter in Rujark.

40 minutes and 20+ kills in, I had gained one... ONE... percent of XP.  I
gave up after a few more kills, switched it all to AA, and got 15% before we
left another 30 minutes later.

I don't see how we could've gotten a lower dungeon given our narrow level
spread, but is it possible?  Or does the LDON XP really slow down once you
get into your mid 50's?

(And while I'm at it, it sucks to be on a 7- or 8-person raid and get 1% of
XP out of 3 hours of killing.  There, my question *and* all my griping in
one place. ;D)
