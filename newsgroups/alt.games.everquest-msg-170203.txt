Like my post about autofollowing being evil, if you're too freaking lazy to
learn these two things by the time you're level 40, people are NOT going to
like hunting with you...and it doesn't matter what class you are.  They may
or may not let it slide, depending on how necessary you are, or how well
liked you are but...

...they WILL be pissed at your laziness.  They WILL remember and do their
damnedest to find replacements for you next time.
