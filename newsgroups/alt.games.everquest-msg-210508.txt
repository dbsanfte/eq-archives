Well, thanks, but truth be told I was about ready to give up on PoM anyway.
I just don't have the time to devote to the annoyingly long camps for an
armor that is a dubious upgrade at best.  Plus the mobs that have the best
drop rates on throne cards are darned difficult for me to solo.

Consider this: in order to get the box that produces the cleric doll I need
to create cleric armor, I need four funny monies.  To get a funny money, I
have to get an item of some sort that's created in the PoM - my
disease-resist flower, for example - and combine it with a words of wealth -
which requires four specific drops to create.  And after I turn in the four
funny monies, it's only a random chance that I will get the box that
produces a cleric doll - I may get nothing at all, forcing me to start over.

It requires a great deal of farming.  More often than not, the mobs you kill
have nothing at all to look.  Being in a full-time raiding guild, I just
can't keep it up.  As much as it pains me to say it, PoM is not good for
me - I need to be spending my time getting more AA.

Interesting.  I wonder what kind of changes they'll make.  My gut feeling is
that drops will go up, but mobs will no longer be soloable.  I think that
would be a fair tradeoff.

I'll be looking forward to seeing what they do with this zone.  It's been in
serious need of a revamping for years.
