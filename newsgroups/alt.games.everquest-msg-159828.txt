You really didn't need to put points in tailoring. Just by making silk
threads from 2 spiderling silks (you never fail on these) you'd get your
tailoring up to 15. From there you could make silk bandages (2 threads)
to 21. However at 21 you might as well start making patchwork armour and
for that you'll need a large sewing kit.

Make sure you have the right ingredients. Make sure items are NOT
stacked.
