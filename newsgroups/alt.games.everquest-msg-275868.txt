Wizard spells (only ones I've checked) trivial at 202 for the level 55
spells, all the way up to a massive 227 for the level 60 spells. If
you're looking at bazaar prices, the components will cost me anywhere
between 500pp to 15kpp per combine (at current prices - this change may
affect the market somewhat), with spell resale values typically half or
less of the component costs (except for the level 60 nukes which command
good prices, but not a high resale quantity). Again, I didn't check the
pricing for non-wiz spells.
If you buy them off NPC merchants (I recommend checking the LDoN
Maguses plus the closest merchants in PoK to port-in and main bank),
it's 10-15ish pp a component, if you're lucky enough to find the higher
ones.

This change could work out OK. If they add new recipes, possibly for
castable scrolls or other tradeskill ingredients that would be good.
Perhaps even letting any int caster research the other classes spells
(we can already research wis caster spells, so why not). And now that I
think about it, they need to redo the low level research quests. They
set up the list of ingredients long before they revamped the newbie
zones with the full newbie armour quests. So there are now a bunch of
mobs there dropping other stuff, effectively nerfing the drop rate for
the research quests significantly.

On the bright side, if and when they add recipes with higher trivials, I
can finally work towards the 'Expert Researcher' title that was denied
us for so long.
