The church is connected to the ballroom.The church is also called the "three 
named area"because of the three named that pop there.I recall that the three 
are Heirophant Vradik,Warlock Gurag,and Luminary Salox.When you come out of 
the pool area into the Golem area, the building you are facing is the 
Ballroom.The church is connected to the ballroom.You need to reg invis in 
the golem area, then Invis vs.undead before entering the ballroom.Once in 
the ballroom,take the farthest right side room you see, this leads to the 
church.
Have fun,
