You could make non-instanced dungeons (and other zones) that reward
crawling and punish camping, among the things you could do:
- have mobs respawn at unpredictable intervals,
- have mobs respawn in unpredictable size groups,
- if there are any PCs near where a respawn wants to show, and the
respawn does NOT outclass the PCs substantially (in numbers and/or
levels), have a significant chance (say 50%) the the respawn is
delayed and heavily reinforced,
- if PCs are camping an area (i.e. one or more groups are keeping
a region cleared of mobs), have the mobs respond by not respawning
and/or sending in heavy forces to reclaim their turf and/or spawn
some scout/pullers (single and small groups) who try to lead the
PCs into ambushes where large numbers of mobs will spawn, all as
seems appropriate to the random number generator,
[/em glances nervously at James while donning asbestos vest...]
- make all of this (and other responses to PC invasions of mob
turf) unpredictable, how about a game that tries to be fun all
the time instead of just once in a great while?!!!

Rewards are important too, but I don't see any lack of imagination
in that regard, these MMORPGs are all way beyond any Monty Haul
campaign I've ever seen or heard of (and that's just the gear a
non-raiding, non-pharming, non-platbuying, non-powergaming,
altoholic like me can get).  So I shan't bother making suggestions
in that regard.

With all the encounter locking, content instancing, character
flagging, and etc., there's clearly no lack of resources serverside
to do things like this and aim them at particular individuals,
groups, and supersets thereof.

And another thing, there are EQ-Live epic 1.5 quest encounters
that spawn with public emotes when a questor at the right stage
enters the zone.  Somebody commented on one of these happening
in the channel last night, and another player asked if the mob
will "hunt down and gank said Paladin".  That sort of thing would
be fantastic!  I want to see a game-world sit up, take notice,
and take action from time to time.  What a breath of fresh air
that would be.
