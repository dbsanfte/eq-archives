Trying to increase faction in Surefall Glade with my Gnome Necro.  I have
been in Black Burrow for what seems like forever.  Does anyone know how many
kills I have to get to increase my faction with the Jagged Pine Treefolk to
go from Dubious to indifferent or amiably???  My faction with the Sabertooth
Gnolls is already maxed out a the worst, and I am kindly considered by
Qeynos Guards and Qeynos Merchants.  Still stuck on Dubious with the druids.
Any help would be great!  Thanks in advance.
