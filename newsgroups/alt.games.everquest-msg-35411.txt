Hehe, that would make an interesting side effect.

"Sergeant Slate is staring at your pint. You could easily defeat this
opponent"
You involuntarily say to Sergeant Slate "You got a problem, mate?"

All female Trolls and Ogres should now resemble female Half Elves

Also, get drunk enough and you can use it as a form of sow, turning 180
sharply to coincide with your swaying can send you across a zone faster than
running, unfortunately most graphic cards can't handle fast spins in EQ and
so you'll end up turning to far and heading off somewhere else :�)

The other downside is, even if you can get this to work you're still
shitfaced at the end of your journey.

I do not advise the above technique is used up the High Pass ramp in EK or
as a means of escaping Grimfeather ;�)
