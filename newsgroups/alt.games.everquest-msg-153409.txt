I do know that using Outlook Express, Internet Explorer (few sessions),
and/or graphics software does cause some framerate loss in the capturing.
Therefore I know EQ would cause a significant framerate drop, enough at
least to have it not work for my needs.

I simply asked if the post was read.  A simple "Yes" with further detail

Based on experimentation with other software which is less of a drain on
system resources than EQ would be.  As to the meaning of the post, I was
sure I had been clear that I was requesting methods to shut down EQ rather
than keep it running.

be able to repeat even the general idea of the question or give any reason
to support why they gave the answer they did.
