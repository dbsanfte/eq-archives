Thats not free, thats slave labor. If you become a guide you'd get the
$12.95 fee waived eventually for WORKING a minimum of 10 hours a week
as a guide. That means that for working 40 hours a month you earned
$12.95. Unless you are trying to emulate a small hispanic child
working in a Kathy Lee Gifford sweat shop, that is a horrible wage and
beneath you.,

Screw that, if you can't afford the $12.95 you can work two and  a
half hours at burger king a month.

The issue is NOT that its 3 bucks more a month and you can't afford
it. The issue is that its 3 bucks more a month with no improvement.
Heck, I'd rather pay 6 bucks more a month for SOMETHING than 3 a month
for NOTHING. This even makes the legends server seem more attractive
now because you actually GET something for paying more.
