Started at 25 skill.  Oh well, guess those 5 points get to stay unspent just
in case something else needs em.

OH my, do they ever mean frequent!  Procs 20 times a fight, what with the
25 dex plus the YV dex bonus.  I need some more dex gear, get my self
buffed dex up to 255 (only 60 dex to go)  This totally blows righteousness
and that cudgel I have out of the water for a melee weapon.  And it only
cost 6pp.... oh and the fact that unlike most clerics I long since maxed out
conjuration cause I actually liked my pet hammer!

Stacks, and ROCKS.  Always mem, always on spell, unless I actually
desperately need the 10 more mana per tic I'd get sitting on my butt.

Actually seems to suck, mana cost is extreme and how often do
I need a group HOT?  Well haven't tried it yet actually.

Didn't test this one out yet, but hard to imagine it will be usefull
very often at all.

2.8 sec, 1023 heal... 400 mana cost.  So its like CHeal expensive
and DL effective, but at Remedy speed.  Haven't tested range yet
