Hmm, there is an easy mob in Permafrost which drops a 6-slot 25% red large
bag. Lore No Drop.

Another one drops in Crystal Caverns but you need a group for those at level
36. Also 6 slot, 25% large Lore No Drop.

The Sewn Evil Eye bag is one of the better ones, 6-slot 70% red but drops
only of evil eyes in Lower Guk.

A weight red bag drops in High Pass, but I don't know from whom (sitting
here at work). I know it's either an uncommon or rare drop so prepare to
spend some time for this one.

There are more, but these are the easiest to get at your level I think. Only
the handmade bp has 10 slots and has reduction. A bearskin potion bag (also
tailored) has 10 slots, but only small items and no reduction. Also a Deluxe
sewing kit has 10 slots and holds giant items, but no reduction.

My 41 mage has the Herbalist Bag from cc, 1 large tailored bag and 4
tailored backpacks in his inventory. The other 2 slots are usually filled
with my summoned 100% weight red bags. I'm going for the evil eye and the
perma one soon though. Or save 5k and get a tinkerers bag (10-slot, giant
items, 100% red) :)
