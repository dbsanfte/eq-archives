Hmmm.  IIRC, Divine Stun (Paladin AA) is limited to L68.  So, if the
mob isn't actually immune to stun...

True enough.  Of course rez isn't usually too hard to find after an
LDoN mission, and if it is I have a 75% rez in a pinch (90% at 59,
should I ever get there).  As I pointed out elsewhere, the only
Enchanter that's died in an LDoN group with me was, IMO, flat-out
determined to do so (she had leftover corpses from earlier missions,
we got her two 96% rezzes, but the clicky Cleric wandered off by the
time she had gathered the rest of them and so she settled for my 75%
on them).
