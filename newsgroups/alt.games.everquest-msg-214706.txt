> Twink monks, or the average monk?

    The average monk *IS* somebody's twinked alt, from what I can tell ;).

    But seriously, how long is a piece of string? I would say to guess my
relatively untwinked SK would never out damage a relatively untwinked monk
of the same level.

    PoN is, well, a nightmare for pulling. I believe it is specifically
designed for that - even the *static* spawns there (nightstalkers spring to
mind with ravenous alacrity) have a nasty habit of remembering you once
they've gone back and reset, and coming BACK in a bunch. Add in the CRAP
visibility, the hideous random-spawn-or-five-behind-you factor, the
you-cannot-see-your-target-due-to-stupid-terrain factor... On the other hand
PoN is *worth* the hideous risks for a mid to late 50's small group, or even
earlier full group.

    On the other hand, I've had considerably more success feign splitting CY
wanderers in PoD, and I've noticed that static spawners in PoV react very
positively to a feign split.

    The really great thing about feign pulling is that you can practically
guarantee singles almost anywhere, which means you can camp nastier and
nastier mobs with smaller and smaller groups, or groups of lower levels. The
feign split is one of those things that can turn a pickup group that just
isnt working into a solid experience earner - groups tend to break after a
wipe, and wipes tend to be the result of adds. So I think the reward is
worth the risks, irritation and time spent for the puller.

    Sure a monk can't use snare, but monk feign can't be interrupted, can't
fizzle, and monks don't run out of mana. My current feign spell costs almost
as much as my biggest nuke... grrr

    From what I can remember, monks held agro at least as well as warriors,
higher DPS presumably having something to do with that. DPS is to agro what
alcohol is to beauty! One of the main reasons I've spent to upgrade my
weapon over and above armour is that holding agro costs less mana with a
better weapon. Holding agro off a monk will always cost me mana.

    And when I think about it, the uber SK agro holding abilities don't
really come into their own until the 50's - I mean comparitive with other
classes. It was only around 58 or so that I found agro management to be
something other than an exercise in mana burning.

Cheers,
James
