The classic reply used to be Monk/Shaman.

This may or may not be the case any more.

Warrior/Shaman sacrifices feign pulling and
DPS for better damage mitigation/higher HP
and Taunt.

I know the primary thought behind War/Cler
is for the rezzes, but (IMHO) the xp goes so
fast at lower levels, and low level cleric
rezzes are so meager, that that's not enough
reason to give up haste/slow/SoW/Wolf pet.

By the time you reach levels where rezzes start
to feel necessary (51+), a shaman/warrior is just
as good a core for a PoP group as cleric/warrior,
since most pop groups I've been in folks feel an
absolute need for both a cleric and a slower.

My 2 cents.  If Martin is reading this, he has
extensive experience shaman/monk among others
and probably will be able to give better advice.
