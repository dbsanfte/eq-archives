This isn't really the issue. The issue is, some news servers are set
up to automagically filter out ANY attachment posted to a non-binary
newsgroups. And the DANGER is, those fascist newsadmins might decide
to let a newsgroup go buh-bye to /dev/null if binary traffic becomes
a norm on it. That means that users of these servers change servers,
and the load increases on the remaining servers.

So, the admins of these other servers become aware of this newsgroup
and decide to cut it too. Soon, the only servers carrying it are pay
servers with 100% uncensored access to filth and spam, and the group
dies a slow death. On the bright side, I really doubt that your four
line attachment raised any red flags =p

As you can see from my paragraph formatting, I am FULLY JUSTIFIED in
making this claim! UN-ALTERED REPRODUCTION AND DISSEMINATION OF THIS
IMPORTANT INFORMATION IS ENCOURAGED! IN THE FUTURE, ALL SCHEMES WILL
REVERT TO MY SCHEME! ATOM! SOFT-LAND THE MOON IN EARTH'S OCEANS, AND
RE-ORBIT VENUS TO CREATE A BORN-AGAIN EARTH!
