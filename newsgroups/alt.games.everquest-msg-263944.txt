Thanks for the info.

Based on that, it seems clear that like EQ1, and AC1, and other games. 
UO *clearly* rewarded players *more* for creating mules to do their 
crafting. Crafting on your main clearly involves sacrificing some combat 
ability; this is a bad thing.

EQ2s completely separate crafter/adventurer systems embodied in one 
character is a good thing because it doesn't penalize you for using your 
main to craft.
