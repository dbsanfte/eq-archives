There's a huge difference between being in a group that voluntarily 
decides to stick it out when group members are getting tired, and being 
in a group where the cleric falls asleep without warning in a group 
where you're already struggling to hold a room.  Although if I were in 
your group I'd still appreciate a warning "okay I'm willing to stay, but 
I'm falling asleep in my chair here".

Except that there's some explanation from the person who made the 
mistake.  "Shit I just snared myself!" "Crap, adds!" etc etc etc.  Not 
just silence as you're screaming louder and louder for heals.  (Note 
that I'm using a cleric as an example because that's the worst time I've 
ever had someone fall asleep on me)

Who's self-righteous?  I believe we were begging for people to be more 
thoughtful of the group as a whole.
