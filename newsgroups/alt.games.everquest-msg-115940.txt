I have been sorely tempted by that site as well. Twinking up a new
warrior a couple mojnths ago, I could not find anyone selling a Mith 2
hander. There sits one on that site for $3, and a CGS for my 25 Druid
at $5 along side it. Hmm... $8 to save me a week of auctioning to buy
these items is quite tempting. I could obtain them in game myself, but
not with any character that would benefit from the experience.
My only holdout: Rewarding loot campers. Just can't bring myself to
contribute to the profitability of a loot camper.
