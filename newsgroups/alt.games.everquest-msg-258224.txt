That's fine and dandy, except for being totally wrong.  Under this logic, I
could roll down an on ramp at 12mph, and when I get to the bottom, roll
directly into the regular highway lanes that are going 70, and when the car
in my blind spot (which I didn't check) that I just slid in front of, knocks
me back off the highway, it's his fault right?  Good luck with that one.
In the majority of cases (like entrance ramps), a merge is effectively a
forced lane change, and the same rules apply.  If you merge and cut somebody
off, it's your fault.
In the real world, the cars that are already traveling at speed on the
highway have right-of-way.  According to traffic laws, they don't _have_ to
let you in- it's a nice thing to do, but it's not a requirement.  Rather,
it's the responsibility of the driver attempting to enter the highway to
find a space, match the speed of that space, and drift into it without
getting in the way of the other cars already on the highway.

The only time you can use "it's the guy in back's fault" as a rule of thumb
is when both cars are already traveling the same direction on the same road.
If someone pulls onto a road and doesn't have enough room to get up to
reasonable speed before they're rear-ended, the rear-ender is not at fault
(I know this for a fact- an insurance company bought my college roommate a
new truck because of this very situation).

Of course, in some states, the idea of fault is completely disregarded.  If
you are involved in any accident, your insurance company pays for damage to
your vehicle, regardless of whether you caused the accident, or were an
unwilling participant.
