There are no other rules but those. Skim them to get the general
idea or print out that section if you are really in doubt.

"1.1 Play Nice Policies - Activity within EverQuest "

Under there is everything you can't do to other people.

This is the rule they broke with you, basically:

"7. You may not defraud other players.

Fraud in all transactions between players will result in disciplinary
action when confirmed by an internal EQCSR. Fraud is defined as
falsely representing one's intentions to make a gain at another's
expense. Examples of this activity include but are not limited to
offering to drag the corpse of another player to safety but instead
hiding it deeper in the dungeon as well as using flaws in a secure
trade window to deprive someone of one of their items."


They were fraudulently stating a rule of the game for personal gain.
There is no such rule.

In the future, page up or down to what they actually said then type,

/report thatplayersname

"thatplayersname" is of course their  character name, like Bilbo or
something. After that you can also petition with more detail like,

"Bilbo is attempting to defraud newbies(like me) out of equipment
by telling them rules that don't exist about loot to try to get items
from them."
