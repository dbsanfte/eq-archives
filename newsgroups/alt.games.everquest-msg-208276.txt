             I have being having a problem recently am I hoping someone can
shed some light. For reason when I have num lock on (auto run) my direction
keys no longer allow me turn, but if I do not have num lock on I can no
longer press shift-up to bring up my previous typed messages in a text
window.



            I use to be able to bring up previous text messages with no
problem and turn with num lock on. I am the only person in my guild that
seems to be having this problem.



            Does anyone have any ideas?
