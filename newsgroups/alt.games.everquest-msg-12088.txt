On the way to my first trip to Velious, I stopped by in Nro to see an old 
friend - Dorn B'Dynn.  I cast Monster Summoning I until I got a Sand Giant.  
Then I ordered it to SQUISH Dorn B'Dynn with its size 100 boots.  Oh how I 
laughed when my giant battered Dorn into the sand.

I kind of got into trouble after that, because I wandered around for a bit, 
and ended up near the platform.  Someone started to /yell, so I ran around 
looking for him so I could help him.  I found the guy but he was dodging 
this way and that, I couldn't see what was chasing him.  Then I realised - 
he was running away from my faithful Sand Giant, which was trailing behind 
me.  I withdrew and apologised over OOC.  Very embarassing.
