Thanks for all the information, folks!

I logged back in the next day and found the level 9 barbarian back in 
the bazaar, so, apparently, she decided not to stay in shar vahl for long :)
She said she got help from another player to get there.  Unforunately, she
was stuck in the bazaar and couldn't move because the frame rate was so bad
on her old computer.  I told her about the clip plane and to look at the
floor and she was able to get out.

The joys of being a newbie!
