Two things: First, don't change the subject line to the post you're
replying to. I shouldn't have to pull old threads to see which one
this was in. Second, QUOTE! I shouldn't have to pull old threads to
find what the hell you're talking about. Most newsreaders can be set
to auto-quote, and most are set to that by default...
