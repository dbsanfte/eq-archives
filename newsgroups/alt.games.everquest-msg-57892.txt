Gotta be lucky to get a GM to get your corpse out.
A friend tried to help a �nlucky monk in Kurns last night, the poor guy 
fell through a pit trap in the cellar in Kurns, too low to kill the mobs 
down there, only way out is a port to the top of kurns, so he couldnt 
get his corpse out again. My friend gave up after 2 hours, and the guy 
petitioned a GM, but no luck, so he probably lost all his stuff down there.
