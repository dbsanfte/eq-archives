It's not going to get to that, most people are too stupid to figure out
how to handle their own situation in PvP. I was offering the advice
because theres a lot of nice spots to exp and the such that you won't
get ganked at.

It's still possible to exp in a not-so-risky situation and still group.
Bit harder than a solo'er thats all. Remember I do have a non-pk char I
play occasionally and I am so rarely attacked on that char its not funny
(its a class that I usually group with as well).

But complaining about that doesn't help his situation, yet my advice
will.

Well if his goal is to die less, then I'm telling him how to do that :p

Very rarely. Over 130pr self-buffed is a bitch to get any poison to
stick to.

I was hanging with a friend on mine who was on his friends 58 rogue, he
backstabs for 650, and higher rogues can get much higher dmg than that.
I don't have THAT much hp, so I tend not to fight them.

Thats true. I'm not offering a sure fire way to not die at all. I'm just
offering the way I keep myself safe. And for a pk who has died 5 times
in the last ooh...6 months, I think my advice is quite valid.

Yep most went to SZ, still pissed about our leader's 57wiz being banned
for ridiculous rule changes.

I figure that :p

Not good. I exp'd mostly, as SZ is Levelquest. A couple of days after
the points standings came out my comp broke and I didn't get it fixed
until a few days ago. Lost the urge to play SZ for some reason, theres
no item loot and theres also a bunch of lvl50+ people now.
