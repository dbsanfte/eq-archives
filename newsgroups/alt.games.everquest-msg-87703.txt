Hmmm, this guy sounds like a complete and utter jackass.  I'm just hoping 
he's ebayed.

I would turn on bardsongs first.  You'll get a '<mobs> eyes have glazed 
over' when he charms it.  Then, with his tells to you, I would reply, "I'm 
going to report you for purposely KSing"  and send in a report then, with 
his taunt prominantly displayed.
Any good bard knows you can do this.  Almost every bard knows that the GMs 
know about this too, and will take action.  I expect that this guy is a 
known griefer, or an ebay character.  It's really hard to make 60 as a 
group-character if you're an asshole.

Screenshots can help you.  They're not perfect, but if you have 
screenshots IN ADDITION to your report, it can sway the GM in your favor.

The simplest is just train and feign his stupid ass.  It's a bit direct, 
and likely to get you in trouble with the GMs.  If you knew what songs he 
was twisting, you would have a better chance of success.  If he's using AE 
slow/snare, I would pull an 'accidental train PAST his group, get well out 
of sight, then feign.  If any of his songs hit the mobs, they will come 
back for him after you feign, but he'll probably be able to kill them with 
his group.

Hmm, I've got a rather nasty idea, but you're going to have to wait until 
he is doing CC, and has several spiders mezzed.  If you can throw 
something at the spiders, you should be able to break mez, and be low 
enough on the hate list that they'll aggro him.  If he's at lower frenzy 
he'll probably still be ok, but if he's at top spiders, a couple 
well-timed mez-breaks could lead to him being stunned and knocked off the 
edge.  
The problem is that Velks doesn't give you a lot of room to be nasty 
without affecting other folks.  I would suggest that the best thing you 
could do is just inform all of your friends and guildmates that this guy 
is a complete and utter prick.  Eventually you'll be able to kill him, but 
you'll have to bide your time.  
(Oh, and if you turn on bardsongs, keep track of the messages, and post 
them here I may be able to come up with other ways to make his life 
miserable.)
