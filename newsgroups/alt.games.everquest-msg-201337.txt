hmmm...no twinking or pling?

in that case, there is no answer, only you can decide really.  How dedicated
are you?  planning to do quests and tradeskills and such?  Sightseeing?

But, for arguments sake, figure 1 week to hit 20, 2-3 weeks (after hitting
20) to hit 40 and 2 months to hit 60.  that's untwinked, no powerleveling,
but assuming you play at least 4 hours a day and aren't off doing this or
that or the other thing, but are concentrating strictly on levelling.  if
you stop to smell the roses, do quests, and not get XP, expect those times
to grow exponentially.

now twinked, power levelling:

1-20 in 4 hours (or less)

20-40 in a few days (maybe 1 day, depending on who you have to PL you, and
whether or not you know the optimal (power)levelling path)

40-60.....no idea.  never had a character above 51.
