And you mislead people with nonsense.  Comparing deficits by
percentage increase is assinine in the extreme.  Your intellectual
dishonesty says a lot about you.  It's the same kind of intellectual
dishonesty you see from the far right-wing administration the United
States suffers under now.

If President John Doe increased the deficit from $1 to $100, that
President is doing very well in terms of deficit spending.  But that
President is also doing terrible in terms of percentage increase.
After all, the deficit has ballooned 100x!

You know as well as I do that Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush have
been the two most reckless deficit spenders in the history of the
United States of America.  When you're President, there's no excuse
for reckless deficit spending, since you have veto power.  I'd rather
see a President do nothing than see the United States continue down
this path of reckless spending.

The Democrats may be the "tax and spend" party, but the Republicans
are the "borrow and spend" party.  The latter is worse.  Much worse.
Anyone with a credit card can tell you that.

The reckless deficits seen under George W. Bush are made worse by the
fact that Republicans have a remarkable amount of control these days.
There's no more excuses: you can't blame it on the Democrats this
time, which is the usual scapegoat techinque.  "Yeah, the deficits
have been bad, but it's the fault of the Democrats in Congress!"

No, not this time.  The reckless government spending we've been seeing
is strictly on the shoulders of George W. Bush and his Republican
administration.  It's all the more insulting since he chose also to
give obscene tax breaks to the richest 10% in the country.  The
"Reaganomics" approach to stimulating the economy that didn't work in
the 1980s and isn't working now.  Not even George W. Bush's father
believed in the fantasy shell game of economics called supply-side
economics.
