Yes for a non twinked player new to the game it is pretty much optimal. Even
for an experienced player on a new server or just one that doesn't twink, it
is an OK rate.

There are little things, like just being able to find your guildmaster, that
can take you an hour or two if you are new to the game.

Figure a level 1 character has about 20 hit points. It isn't uncommon to
twink a new character with 100 hitpoints worth of magic gear, so you can
readily figure the relative difficulty of running a 20 hit point character
vs one with 120 hit points.

Newbie levels are really hell. Figure you can only get so much enjoyment out
of squashing bats and rats for 1-8 levels. A lot of people refuse to do it
with more then one character. All 8 of my primary characters weren't twinked
and are all in double digits. I can't say I am better for the volume of bat
and rat experience I have. You notice there isn't a lot of discussion on the
best weapon or tactics for killing bats: Boring, boring, boring!
