Heh, aren't I, though? Ben actually pointed out already that these messages 
are coming from the same IP that Reg uses (surprise!) so it's known that 
he's the one behind them. My comment above was really half in jest, since I 
know that anyone reading messages from the two of us will have no trouble 
telling who's who behind them. Our unfortunate little reggie has learned how 
to cut and paste, but he's never learned how to use his own language and the 
results speak for themselves.

Hopefully it should be obvious from the text of the message itself but, if 
not, just look in your newsreader for the option that provides a view of the 
message details, or headers, or the "message source". If you find this line:

NNTP-Posting-Host: 67.173.85.179

That means it's Reggie! Note his IP address:  67.172.85.179.

With Outlook Express you can just select the message in the main window, 
right click on it and choose Properties, and then hit the Details tab.
