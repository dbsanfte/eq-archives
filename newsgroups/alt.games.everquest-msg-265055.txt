It is happening. It will take time. Until the flood of spam actually 
stops, I'll continue not to use a real address.

I'm not legitimizing spam in the meantime.

The are US companies because they can be. They don't have to be and if 
you make it a hostile environment they'll just move. They won't stop.

Could easily relocate to Timbuktu.

Rackateering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations or something along 
those lines. I think your stretching it to have them applied to spam, 
even illegal spam. Especially as savvy companies would simply sub 
contract the spam to 3rd party foreign marketing companies.

In theory its possible rico could apply. In practice... well... I 
wouldn't put any stake on it.

How exactly were you planning to establish which 'business' came from 
spamming? How exactly are you planning to obtain records from the 
foreign entity? In fact, given the low reputability of all the companies 
in question it would not be trivial to even establish that the company 
in question actually solicited the spam service.

It would be a delicious irony if I could entwine my discount Viagra 
competitors in legal hell by hiring an offshore company to spam on their 
behalf... and then report the spam.

And the non-American's will pick up the ball.
