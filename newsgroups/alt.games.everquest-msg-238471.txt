Yes, it was.

It wasn't so obvious.  She intentionally sent mixed signals to keep me
baited I believe.  She pulled back, I pulled back, then I came forward, she
came forward, then a blow up, then apologies, forgiveness.  She needed to
say, "back off, Bud".  I asked her to say it many times, MANY times.

It was wrong of me and I regret it, but some good might come of it if he
realizes she is playing around online without thinking there are
ramifications for the marriage.  Aaaah, but maybe she is playing him the way
she manipulated me, waiting for those greener pastures to come into view.
When she told me, back in January, about her relationship with her "first"
real life lover, I wasn't shocked to hear from her that she cheated on a
subsequent man in order to have a little headboard banging with her "first"
one night.  I nonchalantly asked how she could do that, and she /sighed and
responded she was still in love with her "first".  Aaaaaah, I see.  I had
the urge to tell her husband, but I surpressed it, it wasn't my right to
tell.  She held me in confidence and told me things about her life that I'd
rather she had kept personal, and I was stupid for not telling her to do
just that.  She would talk in spurts and bursts.  I had no clue if she was
going to tell me about her dog going to the vet or about the past men she
cheated on in the same breath.  And why was she telling me about past men
she cheated on?  It wasn't a confessional booth.  I never asked her if she
had cheated on anyone.

There is no rational excuse at all for the posting of her character names,
but then again people who are hurt and venting say/type many crazy things.

I was curious about the cybersex thing, having heard about it in the game
for the first time.  At first I feigned a bit more interest in her than I
really had, just to see where things would go.  And my game got turned
around on me, so maybe I deserved it.  She was looking for some online fun,
and that's why she was telling me all about her husband, her life.  She
wanted to see if I would go through with it, despite the baggage she
presented.  I was immature enough to do so.

Agreed.  All but for bizbee's postings.  That guy is just too rude to put
into words.
I needed the ridicule, it helps much more than some realize.
