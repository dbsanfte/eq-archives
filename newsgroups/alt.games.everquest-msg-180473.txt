If you are using a Geforce card, check what version of drivers you are
using.

I had similar trouble with a Geforce2 MX200 card and ver. 30.82
drivers. When I updated to ver. 40.72 most of my trouble was mitigated
(I still get occasional lockups, spontaneous reboots, and crashes back
to the desktop, some of which I attribute to overheating, but mostly
it works reasonable okay). The latest nVidia drivers are ver 41.09
which is what EQ recommends but (for various reasons) I chose to go
with the last WHQL certified drivers.
