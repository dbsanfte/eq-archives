Wow your getting defensive because of a game flaw. Pathetic. No game
should require someone to sit on their ass for 2.5 hours while an
elite team sneaks down to the juggs area of Chardok to COH the rest of
you down from a guild wide wipeout. And his point is valid, although I
would have used something besides moms funeral as an example. your
brother calls and needs you as an emergency babysitter for example. Oh
sorry Bro I can't because My virtual corpse will never be recovered if
i don't sit here and suck my thumb while we do corpse recovery.

He's a Tank. A tan without armor or weapons and friends is not going
to get back his stuff from a dungeon. So either you sit there and
waste time while everyone else who wiped out gets their corpse also or
you leave and then force, beg or annoy your friends into doing it all
over again later because you wouldn't wait. I don't think so. 
The mechanic of corpse recovery frankly sucks. Far better would be a
Insurance you could purchase ahead of time that would link your items
to your body. You could buy X number of deaths ahead of time, it would
provide a money sink and would accommodate all types of people from
those who enjoy risk to those who like security.

That's your view, I doubt most share it. If your not a Rogue or Monk
or mage most of your CR recovery efforts consist of waiting to be
COH'ed or have your corpse pulled to you.

Hey to add enjoyment and really provide a penalty for you, next time
you die slam a frying pan into your nuts. That will give you a real
incentive. And of course slower leveling is oh so neat. Keep that damn
treadmill turning!  there are other means of providing the same
penalties that do not tie up the PLAYER for hours on end.
