Well, except EQ2 isn't designed to work that way (not
the pulling, but the "head out after another mob when
the previous one gets near death.")   If you (or your
group) has power to kill non-stop, you're taking mobs
too low for your level.  You may still be getting XP,
but it'd be like a group in EQ taking light blues in
favor of the greens/blues around them...
