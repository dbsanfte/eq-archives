Easiest way is to ask around.  I have always been very particular about
guilds.  I have some pretty twisted theories about guilds, that not doubt
make people shudder and say "Ugh, not another one of thoe conspiracy
people", so I make sure that I know more than one or two people in the guild
before I even consider.  Then I start asking people questions.  "Hey,
Apollo, you ever heard of Union of the Compromising Positions?"  And then it
gets passed along.  "Nope, but soandso was in it for a while, ask them."

There is a guild on Povar who has been around for a long time too.

For some Guilds it isn't the quality of the player, but the quantity of
players on their roster.  /shudder

Yeah, I have seen a few Guilds like that on Povar, they have yet to impress
me.

Like I said above, Quantity over Quality.

This kind of reminds me of the old, Run don't walk away and whatever you do,
don't turn back around.

The key to remember with any Guild, is that a lot of people share one tag.
Regardless of what your own actions and reputations may be, your guildmate
might be the biggest sleezebucket you've ever seen and people look at the
tag and think of the guildmate's actions rather than yours.
