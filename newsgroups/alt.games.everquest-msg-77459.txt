 Lesser being Nagafen and Vox. All others you can be level 60 and have
100 Alt-Skill points and still be able to kill them. Western Wastes is a
good place for taking on varying degrees of Dragon mobs from the gimpy
(less than Naggy) Yeldema all the way to mean ole Sontolak (However he
is spelled). In my opinion this is one of the best 'training zones' any
guild could utilize to build raid skills.

 You don't need a cleric in the Main Tank group although it's definitely
a benefit and should be done. Our normal strategy usually involves only
one tank and cleric in a group, the other 4 spots being balanced out
with whoever is there. Usually a Shaman will go to the MT group as well.
The rest of the clerics simply watch the MTs health or wait for him to
call out heals. Probably not the most effective thing we could be doing
but other than Tunare and Avatar of War, which we haven't killed, it
seems to work well enough for us.

 Since the Enchanter will normally be the first to die via Tashing and
usually the Shaman second due to trying to Malo/Slow (when appropriate),
you don't really need them in the main group. They don't want aggro, but
due to debuff order they'll more than likely get it. This is why I love
gnome Enchanters. Seeing a gnome die first thing is a good way to raise
my spirits.

 I'd have a main tank here as well. Depending on what you're raiding,
the possibility of adds is a good one. You want to designate someone to
tank the adds and that person should definitely have a cleric in the
group.  If you have two warriors in the MT group you should not
designate one of them on adds (in my opinion) because if you do get an
add the MT group cleric is now trying to keep two main tank warriors
alive. That could get ugly pretty fast.

 Depending on mob we normally tell nukers to not land a single nuke
until the mob is at 80%. At 50% they can go a little heavier and at 10%
they should go all out. 

 As for port capibility, you really only need one Wizard of high enough
level to cast Translocate. A single wizard with TL is enough to get a
raid party of any size out from anywhere. You don't need a porter in
every group come end of raid time.

 Bards main function seems to be Occluding mobs along with resists
thrown in if we're fighting mobs that require it. If the bard is good
they can also twist in attack songs and mana regen. Our bards can handle
3 songs easily even on large raids. Added benefit is from the new Luclin
songs, which are AE. You no longer need to be in a bard group to benefit
from their abilities. In my opinion every guild should have at least two
high-level bards.

 Depends on the situation. Example being Lord whatshisname in City of
Mist. Mage Fire Pets are main (and usually only) tanks in that
situation. Also pets aren't very effective against Gravity Fluxing mobs
since it seems GFlux = Dead pet. Myself, personally, I dislike pets, but
we have some good people with good pet control so I leave it up to them.

 It shouldn't be too difficult for any serious guild to set aside a few
days and PL a gimp cleric to 49. Chances are you will not have a spare
epic cleric to camp out incase a CR is needed. If I were a high-end
cleric I would not take kindly to getting a 50% res all the time while
everyone benefits from 90% or better. That may sound selfish but come
on, it's not that hard to level any character to 49 especially with PL
assistance.

 Evac is not normally needed until after the raid is over. Most raids
it's easier to wipe out on and do a res in place as opposed to Evacing
and going back in to clean up the mess. As stated above, one wizard with
TL should be enough to get people out at the end of a raid.

 Good luck on the retention aspect. It's hard on those who have made the
committment to level up to sit around waiting on everyone else. A
balance of leveling/raiding is what's needed but that can be a hard
thing to accomplish. 

 As for Mages, someone mentioned Mod Rods in a later post. These are
really invaluable in a lot of cases. In particular the ModRod2 Luclin
variety which has three charges rather than one.
