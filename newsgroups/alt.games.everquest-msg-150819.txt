If I understand it correctly, they raised pet's h2h skill (so no need to 
feed it weapons any more), but lowered other weapon skills. This means 
that if you give your pet weapons, and they're not h2h weapons, they 
will actually lower your warder's to-hit ratio.
Again, from what I hear, another 3 problems right now are:
1. it's not very easy to give your pet 2 weapons to force the to dual 
wield if they're between levels 29 and 39. This also means that you 
can't give your pet some weapons for the proc effect, since they might 
actually lower their dps
2. VI raised the damage of procs, but lowered how often they go off
3. Warders seem to not bash any more
