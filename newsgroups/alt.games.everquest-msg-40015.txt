oh please, the majority of "twinks" are alts, so where do you think they got
the equipment from? you think it just fell out of the sky? One way or
another they earnt that equipment, sure not with the char that is currently
wearing but nonetheless they would have *had* to earn it somehow. For
example I *HATE* trying to sell stuff, especially in places like EC, so
instead I just twink my lowbie chars - and there is nothing wrong with that.
One day you will be abke to do the same - well perhaps.

And dont get your hopes up too high, with in a few weeks the new shards
become just like the established ones - then what will you do?
