Just turning off attack seems to work fine. Warriors can still taunt and
PAL/SK can still cast aggo spells. I remember someone once saying that when
a mob enrages the MT turn off attack and back up a little. Perhaps that
helps to stop the mob from turning but I have no idea never playing a tank
myself. Even if the mob does spin all the other melee have to do is pay
attention to turn off attack so they dont get riposited to death.
