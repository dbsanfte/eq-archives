I spent months in LDON to earn my gear - it's certainly not *top of the line*
but it's passable.  And yes it was hard work but I *like* LDON.  (I have
friends that threatened to put me on /ignore if I ever ask them to do another
one).  
My best friend the uber paladin joined a raid guild to get his and raids 3 or 4
nights a week. 
OTOH, I have a tank friend who has NO interest in being an uber player.  He
loves doing the old world quests and tradeskilling and has seen more of the
world than my cleric ever will.  We invite him into our groups because we like
his company, but we don't do it unless we have a strong team without him. 
Because we know we'll be *carrying* him.  
He has only been MT *once* and I love him to death but frankly it just wasn't
worth it.  I kept one finger on my *dismount* icon and one on my *duck* key the
whole time so I could switch to a faster spell when his health would drop from
*50* to *22* in 1 hit.  I literally couldn't take my eyes off his health bar. 
It wasn't fun, it was nervewracking.  Luckily it was a temp job, and when the
real tank got there he was glad to hand over the responsibility.

I have never asked anyone's HP / AC / mana pool / AAs even *after* they join
our group, but I'm always thankful if the tank offers this information.  I'm
going to know the first time you get hit anyway.
I understand where you're coming from on this Dearic.  
But I also understand the guy who's putting together a TIPT group and once to
make sure he's putting together a group that can win.  (Yes, sometimes winning
*is* important).
