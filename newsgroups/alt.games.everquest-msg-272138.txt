Wow, you played The Realm too?  I can't say I've ever met anyone who's
played it besides the real life friends who I got to play it and the
people I actually met on there.  How early on in its lifecycle did you
play it?  I started with alpha, then continued on through beta (when
they totally changed the world), and then played for a year after it
went "live" and charged $50/yr.  Now if only current MMORPGs were that
cheap.  The Realm was my first introduction to online play in any sort
of videogame (I got it soon after my family got its first 28Kbps modem,
or whatever the speed was).  I still catch myself getting nostalgic
about that game.

And believe it or not, it looks like that game is still running!  I may
have to sign up for a trial account just to see how much things have
changed since I stopped playing it.
