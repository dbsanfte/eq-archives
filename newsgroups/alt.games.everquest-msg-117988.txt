It used to be that you could give them a slow 2hander to slow down the atk
delay for things that hit fast (eg bro Z, stanos), but since the last patch
that fixed giving npc's items (including having Mort/Gage say "thanks for
the Primal Velium Warsword, Dumbass" unfortunately) you can't do this any
more.  Yeah, it was kind of an exploit in that it wasn't intended to be able
to happen, but AFAIK no one ever got punished for it since it really was
more of a loophole.   Oh, and also AFAIK it only worked on things that were
either non-agro or using sneak.
