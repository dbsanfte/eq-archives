Java's a great learning language because it forces you to start out by
thinking in terms of object orientation. C is great for comp sci
majors because it's so close to the the metal. I definitely wouldn't
recommend trying to learn modern comp sci with either of them alone,
though. If you're only going to use one language to teach, C++ gives
you a nice median between the two.

Java seems to be a lot more prevalent on the left coast than around
New York City right now. All of the cool aspects of Java (the stuff
contained in J2EE, mostly--EJB and the like) have sort of gone fallow
in the job market and Java has been relegated to the SAS projects done
in ABM shops, which doesn't give anyone a lot of incentive to learn it
better.
