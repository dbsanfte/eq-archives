No offense at all.

Hopefully folks have the brains to not electrocute themselves, but if they
do, it's weeding out the gene pool. I take no legal responsibility for any
tub activity that doesn't involve me in the tub too.

keyboard tray nicely with my keyboard, and there is simply never enough
empty space on my desk for a regular mouse.
