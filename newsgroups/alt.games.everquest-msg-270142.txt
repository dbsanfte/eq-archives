What he said!  I had to get from the Peat Bog to North Qeynos to complete a
step in the Priest's level 10 quest.  A fellow priest and I did the work in
the Bog together.  Now we need to get to North Qeynos...long run eh?  Not
so, into Vermin's Snye, across the pool to Down Below, across the stream to
North Qeynos.  20 steps from Peat Bog.  The little Dwarf was dancing and
hooting he was so pleased that he had learned a new short cut.  Thanked me
profusely, saying that he did not look forward to running through Starcrest
or Nettleview only to have to run ALL the way across North Qeynos as well.
This way where were within sight of the grove of the Hierophant.
