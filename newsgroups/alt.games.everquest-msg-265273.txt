I'd have to agree with you, that IS stupid.  Just buy a character if 
thats how you feel, but I'll still feel sorry for you.

That isn't, however, the same as saying I'd never spend time "playing" 
EQ in situations I find boring or repetitive, in order to advance.

"Investing" in a few hours here or there in exchange for relatively 
small improvements like a level or a piece of gear or an AA or some pp 
or to help a friend or a guild?  Doesn't inherantly offend me to do so, 
although I have my limits, limits which prevent me from actually playing 
the "end game" which involves investing dozens, hundreds of hours in 
massive raids which tend to bore me to tears and result in comparatively 
tiny improvements.

Thus for -me- getting a character which is already level 65 and 200AA 
would be the antithesis of a good idea, that would be one with the fun 
part already removed!

To each his own, though.
