Greetings all,
  I posted a few weeks ago about not being able to play because of
some weird glitch.  Not only did I not solve the problem but it seems
to happen about once a week. Then fixes itself. It usually lasts about
4 hours or so but it's hard to tell as I shut down and try again as
soon as I am calm, which can take 4 hours  :)  
   Example:
  Log on this morning. Like I have been doing for over 2 years now.
Time was 6:45 am est.  Launch my Rogue.  Computer stalls for about a
minute.  After serious HD thrashing I am back at server select screen.
In the past would have never given a second thought to this but after
a few weeks of this I was nervous. Rightly so.  As I hit the enter
world button it says I have an active character there and wait for the
sync.  That was a half hour ago. I rebooted and reconnected numerous
times in this last half hour but I knew it would do no good. It still
says I have an active character. I wonder who is playing him or is he
just standing there LD?  All I can do is wait and hope that EQ will
allow me to play sometime. I can't go to any other server this time
either because of that LAME active character thing.
  The last time this happened I could get to other characters, at
least for a while but some of those would crash as well. Other servers
would play fine though. There really seems to be no rhyme or reason
with this. It just happens sometimes. I have sent repeated, pleasant
and polite mails to VI but so far they haven't even wasted a form
letter on me. Seems to be the typical VI response.  That or " It's
your ISP's fault." 
 I don't really expect a fix for this problem I just wanted to rant.
I am pretty proud that I wrote such a nice post as mad as I am and I
thank you guys and this group for letting me have a place to vent.
   I not just saying this because I am mad but I truly am a card
carrying member of the VI sucks club. It's just a shame that the game
is so good  :)   When it works anyway.
  I hope your questing is going better than mine.
