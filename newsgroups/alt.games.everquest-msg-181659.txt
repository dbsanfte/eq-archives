I agree completely...it's a situational thing...in a raid environmen,
I'd prefer my tank to be a warrior - max hp damage sponge (don't jump
on me for saying warriors are one dimensional either).  BUT, in a PoP
xp group, I'd go Pally then SK any day.  As a ranger, I like to have
my tank be able to grab aggro fast and keep it almost as much as the
dress wearers want it.
