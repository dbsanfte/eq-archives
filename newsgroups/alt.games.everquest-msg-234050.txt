My point is that as you advance and gain levels and start hitting your 50s,
is it not reasonable that you should be able to keep at least one more spell
memorized in your head than a level 1 newbie?  The old pen and paper D&D
games allowed more spells to be memorized as higher levels were gained.  I
understand that this is not D&D but the idea of something similar should at
least be considered and maybe even given a shot on the Test Server.
