Aside from what I posted in my other post, I thought I'd add this.

Your method is idiotic.  If you dispel your crap buffs so slow has a place to
land where it will get dispelled, you're going to lose important buffs the
second the mob starts dispelling you.  And every mob able to slow you is able
to dispel as well.

Hell, maybe thats why you think slow is so common.  You keep letting them
dispel your resist magic since you're trying to leave a slot open for the
eventual debuff.

Anyways, you can go back to the newbie insults now.   Nope, never done
anything here except roxxor Orc 1 a few times.
