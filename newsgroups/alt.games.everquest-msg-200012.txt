I agree.. I was in a PoD group yesterday with a caster and a cleric
who kept slipping out for KEI.  Sometimes it wasn't available in which
case they'd wait (how it's not available is beyond me) until it was.

Luckily, I was logged on as my Shaman and kept the group in business
the whole time, casting celerity, slowing, healing as needed with no
downtime.  Go figure.
KEI?  Who needs it?  I'm a Shaman who's learned the fine art of mana
management.

I won't cast buffs for money and always state openly in Nexus that
Enchanters are pimping out their class.  The whole mentality of
needing a buff to play is ludicrous.

Chanters often point to the cost of the KEI spell, which is NOTHING
these days compared to Shammy spells.  My level 60 spells alone are
120K+ on Ayonae, if you can even find them for sale.  I'm 62 with no
hope in sight of getting them.
Even then, they are self only in regards to Torpor and mob only with
Malo.  No money to be gained there, even if I were a greedy pimp
mofo...  Maybe I should start charging money per slow???
