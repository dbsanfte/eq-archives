If you get in contact with a nice GM/Guide, they'll remove/change it for
you. I've had two surnames changed (one on my warrior and one on my monk)
with no hassle from the GM/Guide. If you ask nice, they may do it.

Of course, if they decline for no good reason, get a friend to /petition
that your surname offends them. =P
