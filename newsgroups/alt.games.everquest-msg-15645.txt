Only of the first. When I was choosing between EQ and UQ, I spent a month or
two reading the newsgroups of both to gauge the demeanor of the player base
and glean facts about the game. There was *plenty* of ranting and raving in
the UO group, but it was all about gameplay issues (PKing, specifically) and
was never, in my recollection, of the "I want you all to know that I quit"
variety.

I would equate that to somebody posting on their guild's (or even server's)
messageboard about their quitting. Depending on the tone of the post, that
would seem less like a childish vent and more like an open message to people
you regularly interact with in game. Then again, there's an assumption there
that the post would be just that - an open message to fellow players who
might miss you in game. Also, I do not frequent RTS games online, so when
you say "network," I can only assume you mean group of players, servers,
clans or some such variation on that.

Fair 'nuff. If you really are interested, fine. I honestly cannot fathom
why, unless you knew him in game, but if there really are people who are
concerned about a nameless, faceless player quiting some game, so be it.
That pretty much answers a good deal of my question.
