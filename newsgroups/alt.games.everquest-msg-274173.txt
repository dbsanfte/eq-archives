No he's saying pussy and coward are have synonomous meanings. But there 
is a reason they are two different words. Synonomys do not always means 
-exactly- the same thing. They often carry extra baggage in the form of 
innuendo and nuance.

Consider:

The police action in iraq was a bad break for America.

The bloodshed in iraq was a blight on America.

According to my thesaurus police action and bloodshed are both synonyms 
for war, and bad break and blight are both synomyms for 'tradgedy'.

Despite that, those two sentences convey entirely different nuances of 
meaning though. Similiarly pussy and coward are not simply word 
substitutes for an identical meaning. Calling someone a pussy vs a 
coward entails significant difference in nuance.

Your being deliberately obtuse. The number one definition of pussy is 
indeed in reference to cat. However, these days, if one wants to invoke 
that definition, especially without obvious context clues... (like 
pointing to the cat) one must actually say "pussy cat".

But it is the same as pussy for 'weak frightened woman'... whether it 
got there by vagina or not is actually irrelevant... its still offensive 
on its own.

Its not a PC bandwagon.

"You are a pussy" is at **best** ambiguous contextually. And as stated 
above, still sexist and offensive.

> Provide citations if you think otherwise.

Your turn for that really. And I mean citations, not dictionary 
etymologies, as dictionaries tend to run 10+ years behind the current 
lanaguage, and its etymologies are consise to a fault at the best of 
times.

No. Actually. It wasn't. You've made errors interpreting it. You have 
yet to satisfy me otherwise.

The credibility of the magazine is something you are just going to have 
to deal with. Few oxford linguistics professors have published papers on 
the modern vernacular of Pussy in America. But I'd welcome you to find 
one. 

> Evidence contrary to your point goes back many centuries.  

The ball is in your court. Find a modern cite.

Evidence many centuries is irrelevant, BECAUSE IT GOES BACK MANY 
CENTURIES. I can find many a tale of children happy and gay. Gay doesn't 
mean what it used to either.

The intent isn't relevant. Just because someone doesn't know why the 
word they're using is offensive doesn't make it less so. A three year 
old telling you to 'fuck off' when all he intends is for you to leave 
him alone, with no idea what the words actually mean is still offensive.
