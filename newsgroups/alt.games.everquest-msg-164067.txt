If RP was <that> important there likely wouldn't be a game at all.
The whole "guess the magic phrase" deal is just a compromise solution
to the problem of having a converstion with a mindless idiot, even
with the bracketed text it can be a problem coming up with the trigger
phrase, a problem that would not exist in a "real" conversation, except
of course in special circumstances where the existence of a "magic"
phrase would be part of the story-line.  It has nothing to do with RP,
and everything to do with the limitations of a computer game.
