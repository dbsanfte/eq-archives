I was wondering if there is any way to create a macro button that pauses in
between each step.  What I would like to do is create buttons for my skills
that allow me to press it once and then it will work for a while continually
using skill after each pause while I can go grab a drink or something.  If you
know of a way to do this please let me know.  For now, just hitting and waiting
and hitting and waiting on the macro buttons.
 
Thanks
