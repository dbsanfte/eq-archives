Thats exactly what happened. 

In 1988, Saddamï¿½s forces attacked Kurdish
civilians with poisonous gas from Iraqi
helicopters and planes. The helicopters were
almost certainly American made, and sold to Iraq.

In response to the gassing, sweeping sanctions
were unanimously passed by the US Senate that
would have denied Iraq access to most US
technology. The measure was vetoed by Bush. 

The White House later granted Baghdad a loan of a
billion dollars.

It wasn't until 1990, when ammunition for
propaganda was at a premium, that America, (and
the rest of the world), suddenly discovered the
Kurds.

Had Iraq never invaded Kuwait, presumably he would
still be gassing them with bigger and better US
made helicopters. Business is business, you know.
