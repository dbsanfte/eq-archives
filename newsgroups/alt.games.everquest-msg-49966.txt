Nonsense.
One of the most crowded zone prior to Velious was Sebilis.  It wasn't
in a zone with a port (and since you had to haul ass to Karnor before
you can even fire EJ port) it involved about 20 mins of running.

Yeah, god forbid there's some element of risk involved.

I thought you said loot wasn't a concern.

Both Hate/Fear, given the new level cap is single group zones.  You
can start pickup groups practically anywhere for these two zones.

SG is completely safe at the zone in (you might want to go there again
and check).  Instead of 3 walrusmen with damn near impossible MR
smacking for 220+ with aggro range the moment you zone in, there's one
walrusman out of aggro range, and piss poor MR at the zone in.  I've
seen folks solo this guy.

Run from CS to DN is comparable to run from EJ to Sebilis in terms of
distance.  The difference is instead of froggies, you have roaming
dragons and drakes which only a handful will see invis or run as fast
as SoW.

Again, goes back to "too risky".

What you want is a save, easy, risk free zone to get exp and phat
lewts.

Raid level stuff?
You mean VP, ST, ToV, Kael, Icewell and maybe Skyshrine?

With the latter three being "pickup group" zones as well.

Only VP, ST and ToV would be considered strictly raid only zones.
