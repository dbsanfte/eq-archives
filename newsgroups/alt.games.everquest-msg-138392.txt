This does sound like a fascnating study... so you know I'm going to have 
to insist on a reference. :) Was it in a textbook or a journal?

Actually, I don't think it does.  Ithink it supports a case for it being
developmentally hardwired, but I don't think we know enough about the 
development of the CNS to really say that differing brain structure 
results from differing genes, as opposed to training and environmental 
influence.  Or, as a followup post seemed to suggest, some hormonal 
influence from Mommy.  Doesn't make it any less interesting, though.

Oh wow.  Just stumbled on this other interesting idea, while searching for 
the study you cited.

Even more frustrating is Lynch's frequent presentation of highly debatable 
propositions regarding the influence of a meme, without making mention of 
alternative reputable hypotheses, some of which are meme-based and some of 
which are not. This problem occurs when Lynch makes the very interesting 
proposal that genes for male homosexuality tends to increase in periods 
when the culture is dominated by gay-intolerant memes that drive 
homosexuals underground. Once homosexuals have been forced into 
heterosexual unions, they reproduce the gene for homosexuality, and the 
genes spread through the population. Once gays reach a critical mass in 
society, gay-positive memes spread, and homosexuals are able to "come 
out." However, homosexual unions do not produce offspring, and so the gay 
population gradually subsides, starting the cycle of intolerance over 
again.

It would have been nice, in the context of this discussion, if Lynch had 
mentioned the fact that scientists have posited other explanations for
homosexuality. For example, Edward O. Wilson, the father of sociobiology 
(the discipline from which memetics is derived) has suggested that 
homosexuality is the result of a purely genetic reproductive pattern in 
which some males, by demonstrating homosexual behavior, remove themselves 
from the struggle for mates that is the main source of conflict in 
primitive societies. By serving as peacemakers, homosexuals allow for 
their close relatives to produce more offspring. In this way, the 
homosexuality gene passes on as a recessive gene to the primitive
homosexual's nieces and nephews. Although Lynch cites Wilson's book, *On 
Human Nature*, in his bibliography, he fails to even mention the 
peacemaker hypothesis.

So both of those hypotheses would explain the propagation of the gene 
despite Darwinistic arguments to the contrary.  It's cute how in the first 
hypothesis, bigotry is directly responsible for the propagation of that 
which the bigotry is directed against.  Kind of poetic justice.  Hard 
hypotheses to test, though.
