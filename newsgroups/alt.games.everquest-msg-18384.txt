*sigh*

I'll say it.

http://www.eqmaps.com/
http://www.eqatlas.com/

Lots and lots and lots of maps at those locations.  Give out any of those 
URLs the next time you find someone that's lost.

(And who's these 'most people'?  I only see a couple "loc of... please?" 
a day and very few people find themselves lost - and what's so bad with 
shouting out a request for a loc once in awhile when you DO get yourself 
disoriented?  If someone's sitting at the gate of somewhere, which they 
usually are, then let them shout out the loc and, bingo, problem solved.)
