Verant won't do this because they're too lazy to keep up with hackers
and this would supposedly make it easier to hack EverQuest. I would
suggest you buy EQ Macros, or whatever it's called now, if you want to
be able to browse the web and play EverQuest. Another bonus is that
using it will make Verant and lots of fat and nerdy people who would
willingly give Brad McQuiad a rimjob cry.

They need to completely overhaul the menu system. Verant has the
design sense of a retard, although I'm sure many mentally disabled
folks could design a better menu system with an old copy of Photoshop.
This is meant to be an insult towards Verant, not retards.
