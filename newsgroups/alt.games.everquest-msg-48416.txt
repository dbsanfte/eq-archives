I did.  But, to be honest, I don't care about my sense heading skill, it is
probably one of the most useless skills in the game, using /loc is far more
accurate and reliable.  Yes, that is in the same hotkey too, I just don't
use it enough I guess, mostly because my ranger is only level 9, and I know
the areas he is hunting in well enough that I don't need to know his loc.
