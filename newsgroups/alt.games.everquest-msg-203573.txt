Whatever you do; don't put them in WIS. SK use INT to cast, so if you
want mana then put them in INT. Personally, I would put them in STA,
as that stat is a lot more difficult to get through items up than INT.
If you are twinking, take a look at the items your got. If you have
many STA items, put the points in INT.
