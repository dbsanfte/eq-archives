You aren't alone.  I know people that play these games, and they all prefer 
to play the single-player in different ways or having a friend over and 
playing on an internal LAN.  When I played RTS, I was the same way.

I never played Homeworld, though.  May have to look into it.  WHat makes it 
different than all the others?
