My *personal* opinion:  I don't care (as much as I used to) if CharA gets
something from CharB.  But since I tend to play as an RPer (since EQ is a
MMRPG), I just don't want to hear CharA claiming "I earned it", but rather
"This was given to me by my mentor/brother/father".  I can easily translate
that into what it means, 'twink' but CharA wasn't involved in the fight that
won the item/armour/whatever so really has no bragging rights.

My young rogue caught an older bard unawares one day and grabbed a backpack
of banded and a pouch of about 30pp.  She disappeared into the shadows and
put every copper of that 30pp into Pottery classes.  She's never seen him
since.
