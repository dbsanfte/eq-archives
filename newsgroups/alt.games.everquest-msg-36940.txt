    When someone recently posted the SoL zone names from Test, there was a
Bazaar and a Nexus. Nexus sounds like the zone where all incoming ports
might end up. Then they could put the ports OUT in the Bazaar, or somewhere
else. But that original "no more than three zones" comment has me
intrigued - speculation was that the wizard port pads would be the launch
points, but wouldn't that place Halas and Permafrost four zones away?
