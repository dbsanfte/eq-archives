1. Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.  Its in the 
constitution.
2. If a state wants to tax a purchase made by one of its residents but 
concluded in another state there will be issues.  If I (in california) make 
a purchase online from a store in florida then what logic dictates that 
california and not florida should get the tax revenue?  Its florida that 
supports the security structure that allows the store to exist.  Isnt that 
what sales taxes pay for?
