You don't have to be level 65, but you do need a boatload of AA.  I am 
not sure what, if any, level requirements there are for the AA skills EQ 
and AM3, but I am reasonably certain that it is level 60 or below.

The difference is that a level 56 wizard cannot cast 700+ spells 
indefinately, wherease a ranger can fire arrows indefinately with EQ.  
Even without EQ, you can carry a whole lot of arrows.  Not to mention, 
with EQ, a ranger can use the very best of arrows without having to 
replenish the supply.
