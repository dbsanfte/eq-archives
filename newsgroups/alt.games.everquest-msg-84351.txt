Care to be more specific?  I'd not have posted here if I hadn't already BEEN
there.

- I looked for the quest item (invasion plans) and found nothing.
- I looked at the monster entry in the bestiary, and there was no link to
any sort of related quest.

Because I don't care to pay for a site subscription, I can't use the site's
search functionality.
