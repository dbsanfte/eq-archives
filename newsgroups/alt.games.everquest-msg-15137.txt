}Really, this argument seems so moot now that there are options to 1) turn

}upset about.

It is my understanding that /inspect off does the exact same thing as 
changing the setting in the .ini file, ie, only hide the message.  
Personally, I want the message, so I can brace myself before someone 
starts begging me for my hard-won Green Silk Drape.  If there were a way 
so that when they right-clicked on me all they got was a message saying, 
"please ask me, and I'll turn inspect back on for you", I'd be more than 
pleased to set it that way.
