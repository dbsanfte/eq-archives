you're lvl 35.  it's SUPPOSED to take you eons to accumulate cash.

most of the nice stuff in velious requires a decent sized and lvl'd group to
get, you're not going to get rich off drops solo'd at lvl 35.

there's the very occasional drop from the cougars in ice clad, but kinda not
worth it considering the drop rate.

save your toes, helmets and heads from the giants in GD to sell to other
players working on their shawls or CoV faction.

might try to check out crystal caverns.

outside of velious, you could probably hunt in RM for cash from hill giants,
which ranges from crappy to "wow" (with more in the crappy range).

you could solo SolA, i made decent cash and nice XP that way in that lvl
range.
