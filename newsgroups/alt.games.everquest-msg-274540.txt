I wouldn't doubt it for a second.  Times march on, though.  The word
then evolved into an insulting word for female genitalia, which then
evolved into an insult for a man who appeared so unmanly that he was
thus accused, in the most vulgar and offensive way,  of owning female
genitalia.  THAT's what you are blind to, and THAT's why everyone is
laughing at you, and THAT's why the dictionaries list the definition
for "pussy" the way they do.

LMAO - there have never been any signs from Lokari, which is why you
now accuse her of having them, being the clod that you are.

It's FERAL, you moron - don't just look blankly at the dictionaries,
slack-jawed and drooling... USE them.  Better yet, understand what
they try to tell you.
