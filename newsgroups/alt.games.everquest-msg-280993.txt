Why does one have to "learn" anything and be more like the other?

What's the point of making them the same. Let the people who want to 
play WoW play WoW, and let the people who want to play EQ play EQ.

If the WoW formula is better than the EQ forumla in terms mass appeal, 
so be it. Monopoly sells more copies than Risk; I don't want Risk to be 
made more like Monopoly though.
