The ability to create four more characters on your account, for a total of 
eight.

Pretty chintzy, IMO, as were some of the attempts to dump some of the 
"extras" on you when creating your account.

I moved to playing WoW simply because I can't play two MMOGs at once.  I 
enjoyed EQ2 almost equally and figured on returning to it once I played WoW 
out (which I didn't think would take that long).

But it appears as though there's more to WoW than I initially believed, and 
some of SOE's pettiness is causing me to rethink my notion of returning to 
EQ2.  Time will tell, I suppose.
