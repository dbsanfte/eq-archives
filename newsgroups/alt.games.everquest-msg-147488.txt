Hrmmm... may I ask.. when watching TV, do you sit and watch the
commercial, or leave the room to get a drink/run to RR, or possibly
channel surf till the show comes back on?
Me... Yeah I surf, or do something else... sometimes Ill sit thoug the
commercial, but bleah... hate em.

I find pop up ads to be in the same vein... and If I had a choice...
Id turn off all the ads on TV.... but Alas. NO TVO for me..

so me personally, I have a popup killer running, oh and yes I do pay
for allakazam, because I use the extended search features.  If those
features were available without paying, I wouldnt, and I would still
run the pop up killer...
