The effect is that you proc, with max dex, twice per minute with your 
primary hand and once per minute with your off-hand, assuming you have 
no Combat Effects on your items and no AA affecting your proc rate.

Haste, swing rate, weapon speed, ATK rating have no effect.  You will 
basically proc 3 times per minute, twice on primary and once on off-hand.

However, since you can only proc on a swing (hit or miss doesn't matter 
for PC's), your weapon speed and haste will have the effect of smoothing 
out the proc rate or making it very lumpy.

How it's actually calculated in-game, I don't want to think about, but 
the net result is 2ppm / 1ppm.  If you purchase all 5 levels of Weapon 
Affinity on a warrior that rises to 3ppm / 1.5ppm.
