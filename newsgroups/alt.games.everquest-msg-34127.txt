Based on the content of her previous posts and the her
efforts in providing an EQ community resource, I'd say
this sort of thing represents a very small fraction of the
time she plays.

If her conduct here is representative of her conduct in
game, I'd guess she treats people with respect until they
demonstrate a lack of respect for her, at which point she
takes the gloves off.

As far as interest, one of these threads is like a 15 car
pileup on the freeway, as bad as it is, it's really hard to
look away.
