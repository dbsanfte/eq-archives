Yes, but the point was, if I offered to change them money, then 
autosplit could be left on, ensuring they got *some* money, rather than 
*no* money.

250.  From The Safehouse: "But the cap is 200 at level 50 and goes up 
5/level to stop at 250 at level 60. Prior to level 50 I'm not quite sure 
of the formula."  As far as I can tell from doing skill-ups as I level, 
it's the same as any level-based skill - when lockpick is max 170 for my 
level, I know I won't get further than that in poison making, either. 
Poison - I really don't know how effective it is.  I just enjoy using it 
once in awhile when I'm in a more-roguey-than-usual mood :)  But all the 
rogues I've talked to, it looks kind of like a half-swear-by-it-half-
don't - ie, personal choice - the fact that they just redid poisons for 
PoP makes it even harder to judge - especially since they're level 
limited, thus I can't even try most of the stuff.

I have different sets of channels, depending on what I'm doing.  If I'm 
tradeskilling or vendor/faction farming, I'll join stuff like eqtraders 
and watch the news/flames scroll by, if not, I stick to 2 channels, both 
of which are usually fairly quiet.

Now this is interesting, because I was in OT the other night, and we 
*did* have a ranger pulling, and he *was* snaring, so I whipped out the 
bow and arrow to practice.  And every goddamn time I hit them, they'd 
turn from the ranger and come for me.  Am I wearing eau d'caster or 
something?

> Why so fussy?

Less jockeying for position = faster kills = faster exp.  I try to be 
the most efficient puller I can be, because I'm very, very impatient.

> Magicians are your friend

If I had magicians for friends, I'd already know whether pets could up 
my defense skill or not, wouldn't I? ;p

Sounds like the CoF someone was trying to sell for 80k today while 
defending himself from shouts of "yeah right, try 45k" with "I saw it 
for that in the bazaar!"  And whine whine whine. :)  You don't have to 
skill up THAT much.  I make the cheapest arrows possible for pulling.  
200 range on the bow means 50 or 100 range on the arrow isn't going to 
make a heck of a lot off difference.

Only place I've used ID in a group was when I partnered with a wizard 
who agreed to snare.  I think it went off all of once, but the skill was 
only 50-something... and it *did* save me some damage-taking.

Especially since, iirc, ID is capped lower for rogues than monks.  Blah.  
Well, it's a matter of pride, so I'm still gonna max it.  And disarm - I 
read it's possible to make hotkeys with melee buttons so I was going to 
add it to backstab, but I either read it wrong, or they wrote it wrong.  
Don't suppose you know for sure?

BTW, we had a monk in our group in OT the other day - the bastard 
disarmed 4 or 5 sarnak berserkers that night - I kept looting to grab 
the war braids and going "wtf, where'd the - okay, do NOT tell me you 
got it to work AGAIN"

Fucking right it's sick.  *bitter*

BSs are never as good when other people are around as when you're solo 
:p
