"back off you kill stealers" is an overreaction?
If they are fighting something they are very unlikely to see anything not in
caps
due to combat spam.

You obviously have no respect for your fellow players.
I pull a name mob and you would kill-steal it and then tell me to calm down?
You are a lovely piece of work and thank you for your invaluable input.

Guys I am trying to have a fun game with reasonable people, not trying to
get aggro
or be aggroed by inconsiderates. Is that too much to ask?

No matter, I'll never know the outcome anyway, just hope that they never
make it
past 20th level so I have to deal with them in lower guk trying to KS the
various camps there.

Disappointed, frustrated and unhappy.
