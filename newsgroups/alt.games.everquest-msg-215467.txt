When I played on Tholuxe when it first came out a druid (Yost if
anyone here plays there) was being shifted by six (or so) people so
they could use it to powerlevel themselves up. That druid was indeed
the first to hit 50... but it only beat me by a day, and no one has
ever touched my accounts but me. :-)

They didn't bother taking it any higher until much later. I did get
the fun of being the first druid on the server to 60 (Tholuxe reached
maturity fairly soon after velious came out). For the glory? Nah. I
just wanted the leveling done with asap so I could play with my
lowbies while still having the perks of being with the top end guild
and doing all the neat high end stuff first. :-)
