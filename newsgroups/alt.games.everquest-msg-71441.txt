|Doubtful. Something that changes the scenery would require too drastic
|a change, and there are limited "static" houses already in the game.

	Have a 'neighborhood' portal in each town that lets you visit player-owned
houses that are handled on the client machines, in a Sims-like sub-game.
Players wouldn't be able to use houses for storage or trade with others while
in them but you'd have the ability to decorate your house and a private place
to socialize.

|>-Melee binding anywhere like casters can?

|I think that would be going overboard personally.

	I don't.

	But I'd fix the disparity by defining all the bindable zones in the game
(more than just towns; you should never have to run more than one or two zones
in the game to get to your corpse), and then introducing a /home command or
the like to let anyone set their home point when at a legal spot.  Bind
Affinity would only be used to set your Gate destination.
