Thurgadin armor is the easiest to get, and you start out at works
Apprehensive to them.  It being the easiest also means that it's the worst,
but still worth getting!

Dragons and Giants you probably start out KOS.  Giant armor is harder to
get, but better...but not as hard, or as good as dragon faction.

For casual players there's very little reason to go with anything but
dwarf/dragon factions.  Dragon faction takes a long time to break KOS but
there's at least one quest that'll get you down to ally a lot faster (once
you hit dubious).

I know you don't care about convenience but dwarf/dragon is also BY FAR the
most convenient.  I understand that hunting in Cobalt Scar does NOT hurt
your dragon faction and there's a dragon ring there to make the hunting even
more convenient if you've at least made one druid friend in your 50 levels.
