There were 40+ servers at release, and another 40 within a couple days. 
Anyone who was "shoe-horned" fits exactly into my description above.  I
don't have any inside info, can only base what I say here on what I've seen
on the boards, and there are exactly six (half dozen, one less than seven,
one more than five) servers that are listed under the names of the people
complaining about constant queues.  Additionally, with 15 minutes worth of
research I could tell you the *multiple* "uber" guilds that took up
residence on each of those servers, but anyone could do such research, and
quite honestly I don't care enough to even use it as a supporting point.  =)

The Blizzard forums, cesspool that they are (no disagreement here), are the
most representative of the user base, and the best place to see how many
complaints are being made, and by whom.  I would bet large amounts of cash
that 80%+ of the WoW players have never looked at Slashdot.  =P
