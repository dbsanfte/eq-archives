Subject: Cleric question about death...

I was playing in a LDON group tonight - all strangers....
A roamer came in, chanter got beat up trying to get him mezzed, I healed
chanter, got complete heal off on warrior who was at 20%.  I'm guessing the
ranger started taunting to get agro off the warrior, by the time my CH took on
the warrior the ranger was at 35.    This mob just kicked his *butt*.  I yelled
for backup healing because my spells weren't taking fast enough and the shaman
was afk.  (Up until this point we had never needed him to heal, never even got
low, so there was no reason for him to expect trouble).  Got superior heal off
on ranger once, was going for a 2nd when he went down.
The ranger didn't say a word when I apologized, I rezzed him 90%, we completed
the mission, (and won), but it really bothers me.  
I'm level 53 with 1 AA point.  I think this is the 6th death in my career -
twice it was my BF the chanter, once was a party wipe not at *all* my fault
that I really don't count, and two rangers.     
I don't like my BF getting dead but I don't feel *bad* about it.  But I *hate*
it when a stranger gets dead.  It really bothers me *alot*.   
Any other clerics out there ever dealt with this *death guilt syndrome*??
