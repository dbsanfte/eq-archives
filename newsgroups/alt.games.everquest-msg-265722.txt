I see it as a tool that can enhance 'fun' without 'wrecking' the worldy 
aspects.

What average loot?  Is average loot LDoN named drops? Or is it Kael 
quest armor? Or is it old world planar armour?

What do you do after you have a set of 'average stuff'? (Which should 
come pretty quick if its dropping of everything and its pet, unless its 
'ultra rare' like Kunark stuff and then you just go somewhere kill 
stuff, and then come back hoping someone somewhere looted the Bard 
Sleeves, can't use them and has them up for sale.)

And as for named stuff; if guilds could get the same loot from all the 
pop gods why bother fighting all the pop gods, why not pick on the easy 
ones, or the ones that they already know how to beat. Items are the 
carrot EQ leads players forward with.

I agree its not the best game design, but its what we're dealing with in 
EQ.

Because today I picked an X. If I picked a Y I'd go to the temple of 
Yness. If I picked a Z I'd go to the temple of Zness.

Nothing of the sort. I like picking a goal and going and making it 
happen.

It doesn't really matter if it drops in multiple places. If I decide to 
shoot for an X and I get to the temple of X, and see that the keeper of 
X is camped, then head to Y and find out that Y's alternate keeper of X 
is camped and head to Z. ... the immersiveness has already been wrecked 
for me by that point. I'm reduced to scouring the world for a place I 
won't trip over someone else...

How heroic is that? 

The brave band of adventurers creep down into the depths of the Spider 
Queen's tunnel complex into the very heart of the Spider Queen's lair. 
They hear voices ahead... 

Will you pull up a chair and play cards with the other band of 
adventurers already there waiting for first band that got there to get 
the queen and leave? Or you could trudge another 40 miles to the Caverns 
of the Snow Witch... in the hopes that the Snow Witch won't already be 
dead.

I would find instancing done well more immersive.

It doesn't have to be convenient. Hell if it was harder to get an 
instance to fight in to get an X than it was to just get an X I'd still 
prefer the instancing.

Don't lump everyone in one pile. This has nothing to do with 
convenience. It has to do with allowing more than 1 person in a 
massively multiplayer game have the same idea at the same time without 
the game turning one away disappointed.
