I think the 'Official' explanation is that the heretic Erudites zapped
Cat-town with some kind of magic weapon and this somehow ended up
sending some of the kerrans to the moon... something like that.

ah, here's text from the Luclin FAQ:

"The Vah Shir are a race of noble cat people that were wiped off  Odus
and deposited on Luclin many years ago in the test of a great weapon
by the Erudites.  The weapon, aimed at the Vah Shir home city of the
same name, flung the entire city and the inhabitants therein through
space, leaving what is now known as The Hole.  Without their nobility,
the remaining cat people, dubbed "Kerrans" by the Erudites, were
easily rounded up and segregated to Kerra Isle."
