L60 monk in the guild I used to belong to had 1428 ac last I checked. And
that is still missing some of the better stuff (A tunic from sleeper's,
some of the more obscure ToV quest items and such).

And she is human...if she was luggage, she would be even higher.

An iksar SK would smoke any ogre/troll in the ac department. Before velious
