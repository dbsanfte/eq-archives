Just wait if/when they add Velious textures to the Luclin models...

It's not just with the newbie tunic, it seems to happen with all kinds
of armor. Most of the screenshots I've seen have a piece of plate
armor if they have anything visible.

Loooove the attack animations... Main tank last night spent a while in
skeleton form. He just stood there with his big pointy stick while the
spider's HPs dropped.

Hehe.
What I find a tiny bit weird is how my wolf-form head is higher up
when I sit than when I stand, due to canine anatomy. It's better than
not being able to see any movement at all, but it was slightly
disorienting the first couple times I sat/ stood up.

I've actually seen our dog sit the way the animation does. However,
those rare occasions are usually when she decides to rub her butt on
the carpet :)
