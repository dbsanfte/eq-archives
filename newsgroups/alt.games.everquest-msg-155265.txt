** Odd New Objects in the Land **

Folks across Norrath and on Luclin have reported seeing odd new objects in
various locations.  They appear to be some sort of magical portal, though
local spell casters have yet to discover how they arrived or exactly what
their purpose is.  They have determined, however, that these objects are
slowly building in power.  Attempting to use these portals at this time can
have unexpected results.  Experts recommend that adventurers avoid these
objects until they know more.  For more information on these odd devices,
visit www.planesofpower.com


** Important Notice Regarding Alternate Advancement Reimbursement **

Due to the changes made to Manaburn, Rods of Mystical Transvergence and a
previous change to Innate Regeneration, we are reimbursing several Alternate
Advancement (AA) abilities.

Once you log in today, if you have any of these abilities, please check your
AA window immediately!   If you have more than 30 unspent points, IT IS VERY
IMPORTANT that you make certain that your character has 30 or fewer AA
points before  The Planes of Power launches on October 21st! The return of
these AA points may put your total number of unspent points over the 30
point maximum. Your pool will be reduced to 30 the first time you log in
after the launch of Planes of Power on October 21st.

We will be refunding all Alternate Advancement points in the following
abilities:

Innate Regeneration
Manaburn
Mental Clarity
Quick Summoning

Refunded Alternate Advancement points may be spent in any way you choose.
None of these abilities is being removed, and of them only Manaburn is
changing.

NOTE:  Cannibalization, Gather Mana, and Mind and Body Rejuvenation will not
function if you do not have the necessary prerequisite, Mental Clarity 3.


** Alternate Advancement **

- Mana Burn can be cast on any given target only once every minute
- Spell Casting Fury and Soul Abrasion will now stack

Illusion
- Fixed Purify Soul, it should now cure poison, disease, damage over time
spells as initially intended
- Reduced the reuse timer on Divine Resurrection from 72 hours to 36 hours
- Reduced the reuse timer on Mend Companion from 144 minutes to 36 minutes
- Reduced the reuse timer of Warcry from 72 minutes to 36 minutes.
Increased its duration from 5 seconds per rank of the ability to 10 seconds
per rank of the ability


** Defensive Changes **

- Decreased a monk's ability to mitigate damage (please see the Developer's
Update on www.everquestlive.com for more details)

mitigate damage in some situations
- Upgraded Warrior dodge cap to 190
- Upgraded Paladin, Shadowknight and Bard dodge cap to 170
- Upgraded Ranger and Beastlord dodge to 170 and defense to 240


** Spells **

- Complete Healing will now heal a maximum of 7,500 hit points
- The Rod of Mystical Transvergence spell has been altered.  The spell has
been renamed to "Mass Mystical Transvergence".  When cast, this spell
summons a Rod of Mystical Transvergence for everyone within 300 feet.  This
rod is no drop and contains 3 charges of Mystical Transvergence.  Each
charge restores 360 mana at the cost of 450 health.  A player may only use a
charge from the rod once every 5 minutes.
- Additionally, there is a new "Rod of Mystical Transvergence" spell for
sale in the Bazaar.  This is a single target spell that summons a rod with 3
charges of Mystical Transvergence.  This rod has the same abilities and
restrictions listed above.  This spell is a targeted summon that costs 400
points of mana to cast.
- Changed the way Focus stacks with other strength and dexterity buffs
- Circle of Seasons will overwrite Resist Cold
- Dance of the Blade should now stack with McVaxius's Rousing Rondo
- Harness of Spirit and Rage should now stack properly

- Fufil's Curtailing Chant should now stack with Occlusion of Sound
- Protection of the Glades should now overwrite Blessed Armor of the Risen
- Blessed Armor of the Risen should now stack with Lunar Whispers
- Fixed a bug that was causing some applications of spells and ranged
attacks from great distance to go unnoticed by NPCs
- Contact Innates (such as Boon of the Garou) should now be working for
bards
- Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause helmets and sometimes hair to
disappear after an illusion was cast
- Bard songs should now blink on recipients other than the bard


** Interface **

- New Alarm feature added.  When you first log in you will see a pop up
asking if you wish to set an alarm and if so for how long.  There is also an
option to choose to never see that pop up again.  If you choose this option
you will need to set ShowAlarmWindow=TRUE in your eqclient.ini file in order
to see the pop up again.  The alarm will trigger after the time you set has
elapsed, no matter what character you are playing on whatever server, up
until the moment you log out.
- /played now displays how long you have been playing this session and, if
an alarm has been set, how long until that alarm sounds.
- /pet sit down should now work on charmed NPCs
- Added 3 new context menu options for chat windows: Reply To, Tell a
friend, Tell a Raidmember (for future use).  Each of which has a submenu
containing the list of Reply targets, Friends, or Raidmembers, as
appropriate.  Clicking on the player's name will place "/tell <name>" on the
chat entry line, and move the focus there, closing the menu.
- Changed /loadskin.  It now brings up a window that will allow you to
select a skin from a list, determine whether to use the INI or not, then
load the skin.


** Beastlords **

In order to allow us to better tune warders, we have made changes to the way
that these pets work.  Previously a Beastlord would summon a pet using an
ability button and then use level-appropriate buff spells to increase the
pet's level.  Because of the way this mechanic works, it was very difficult
to tune these pets.   Hopefully this will have the side benefit of making
things a little easier on Beastlords by reducing the number of steps
required to cast the pet.


Beastlords will now summon their pets using spells rather than an ability.
The series of spells that was previously used to buff the pets will now
simply summon the appropriate pet.

Unfortunately, these pets will no longer zone with the Beastlord, and will
need to be resummoned (instead of rebuffed) after zoning.

We have made some adjustments to these pets already.

- Added the casting time reduction that is already in place for Paladins,
Rangers and Shadowknights to Beastlords


** Items **

- Merchants now highly value the Staff of Forbidden Rites and will only sell
them at an extremely high price.
- Dance of the Blade should once again stack with Nature's Melody and Song
of the Deep Seas


** Trade Skills **

- Made it slightly easier to get skill increases while doing Tailoring,
Tinkering, Smithing, Baking, Brewing and Alchemy.  Made it slightly more
difficult to get skill increases with Pottery and Fletching


** Miscellaneous **

- Player Character corpses with no items will decay in 3 real life hours,
not 7 days

- Fixed a bug that was causing Lay Hands to not heal enough damage
- Zoning while on a horse on a boat will no longer cause you to appear on
the other side in the water
- /face (face picker) will no longer work while under the effects of an
illusion
- Taunt should be more effective and more dependent on the level of the
Taunt skill for PC's and NPC's below level 60.
- Levitation can no longer be cast on Traders in the Bazaar
