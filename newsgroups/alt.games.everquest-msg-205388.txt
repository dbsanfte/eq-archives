This is NOT a put-down in any way, shape or form.  Just getting that
disclaimer out at the front. :)

If you're new enough to the game to ask that question (which has already
been answered), chances are you're not high enough to solo the corrupted in
any case so as an off-the-topic suggestion I'd recommend one friend if
you're 55+, two friends if you're 50+ or 4 friends if you're 45+ to help you
out.  You can solo the regulars, but when a tainted spawns, call 'em in to
help.  Tainted is pretty easy but the corrupted spawns immediately out of
his corpse and can be really really annoying.
