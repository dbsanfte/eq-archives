You're talking Velious so outdated drops are an almost certainty.  No mana 
regen items that I'm aware of either.

If you're looking for something fun to do in Velious though, then TOV (east 
wing where EVERYTHING is aggro) might be fun.  The bad part is TOV is 
decidedly NOT fun if anyone is KOS to dragons since you have to get past a 
bunch of drakes & such in the entry hall...and I believe they all see invis.

You might be able to do Vindi if you have a tank with 6000+ (preferably 
7000+) hp unbuffed and 3 clerics (must be clerics) who know what a CH 
rotation is and has had practice doing it.

You might try the Burrower in Acrylia if you have a 60 shaman or mage to 
mala/malos and someone who can get a slow to stick.  He's pretty fun, is an 
easy CR, and can drop some very sweet items ("sweet" being relative, but 
based on your levels).  He's a 5 day spawn I think and may be contested 
though.
