There actually is a pretty good technical reason for it.  If you notice,
when they patch a server, you download a bunch of new files to your local
computer.  Since there are alot of people out there who play on multiple
servers (and would be alot more if the servers were down at different times)
then if they did what you're suggesting, here's what could happen:

    1.  Joe EQer logs into Bertox server with his Shadowknight.  Since
Bertox has already been patched a half hour earlier, all the new files are
downloaded to Joe's machine so he can play on the newly upgraded server.

    2.  Joe EQer decides to jump on over to play his Paladin on Luclin
server which isn't due to be upgraded for another couple of hours.

    3.  One of two things could happen here:

            a.  The patcher could recognize he has different (newer) files
than what are required to run on Luclin server, so it repatches.  I don't
think there's any way it could do this at this point since patching of the
local computer takes place before you ever select a server, so more likely
what would happen is....

            b.  Joe EQer logs into Luclin server, which is running a server
that may or may not be compatible with the new files he downloaded already,
so all kinds of hell could break lose.

The main problem is, you have to keep the clients synched up with the
servers and the easiest way to do that is to upgrade all at once.  The only
other way would be to do the patch check AFTER you select a server, but that
still creates a problem if people switch servers alot, you could have your
patch servers all clogged up like when they release new bugs *ahem*  I mean
expansions...
