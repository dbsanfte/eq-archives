Hm, my own news server still hasn't shown me the FAQ post itself.
It was, of course, rather large, so I expected it to propagate
slowly, but I'm worried that maybe I needed to break it into parts?
I guess I'll do that next month when it's time to post it again,
but for this month I'll see how the monolithic version does.

It does appear that some people have seen it, since I've gotten one
correction already. :-)  (And two pieces of spam to the special address
I set up for it.)

Anyway, if the FAQ doesn't seem to be getting through to your server
and you're curious what I've done with it, see the web version at
http://www.iCynic.com/~don/EQ/age.faq.htm
