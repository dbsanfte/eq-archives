I don't know what "core" software is.  The graphics engine is run
client-side.  The server doesn't tell your computer anything more than
a few basic bits of information about mobs.  It's possible that they
would make changes to the game engine in old zones that would require
everyone to have the new engine in order to enter the zone.  However
in most cases, it is just plain easier to not have such a requirement.
 The server sends out information about where a mob is located, which
direction it faces, if it is attacking or casting, etc.  Your engine
interprets that in to images on its own.
