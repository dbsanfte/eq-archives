AGP Aperture is the amount of memory the AGP bus will be able to play with
(storing textures basically) If you have a 32mb card and you set the
aperture to 32mb it will only use the onboard memory of the card to store
these so if you set it to 64mb then it has an 32mb to use if it has to load
more than the 32mb on board ram can take...does that make sense?
It doesn't, afaik, take this memory from your system ram and hold it (as a
Mother Board with onboard VGA will) it just sets how much the AGP bus can
use when/if it is needed.

As said before the common theory is to set the aperture to half of your
system ram. You can do this in the Bios, press F2 or Del (normally Del but
it should tell you on the screen to "Press <key> to enter setup") when PC is
going thru it's first system checks on booting. Under chipset features you
should find the VGA settings like AGP aperture and fast writes, Once changed
exit saving changes, normally Esc to main menu and F10 for this. You have
512mb so the common theory in practice would be to set it 256mb (as you
didn't know what I meant I imagine the aperture is set to the 64mb default)
but this can cause some problems and I found setting mine to 128 was much
better.

As you weren't aware of the setting I don't think this is your problem but
it may help the performance of your system.
