If you are talking about me, I'm not promoting theft in any way... In 
fact, my job description (whether it's adequate or not is another matter) 
is "artist", and my own livelihood depends on copyrights, so I'm very 
well aware of the issues at stake.

On the other hand, it's clear that the notion of "theft" is not the same 
when you are talking about an art industry that deals in originals (say, 
painting or sculpture) and one that deals in copies (like music or 
writing). It's entirely possible that a person that would normally spend 
$50 a month in 5 CDs, these days spends $50 a month in CDs *and* listens 
to $100 worth of MP3, without any damage whatsoever to the industry. 

As for me, I'm living off the massive CD collection I accumulated during 
the '90s. Other than Patty Larkin and Bruce Springsteen, I'm not really 
interested in any new music, so I approach the issue of piracy from a 
purely academic point of view.

And from that point of view, I think it may actually be a *positive* 
development for the music scene... For example, if artists released 
songs one at a time in MP3 format (under whatever copy protection 
schemes you fancy), that would put an end to the current practice of 
releasing an expensive CD with perhaps one or two good songs and a whole 
bunch of filler material, which may have contributed to sour the public 
on the whole industry. Hell, having the artists publish the music 
themselves would already be an improvement.
