Never. However, they say 3 months I think which is the Guarantee. If
your character is not there after that time its gone and you can't say
"my friend bob's was there for 18 months!"

I remember a while back they were going to delete all characters who
were not played for like a month and that were below level 2. That
would have freed up LOTS of space they said (since lots of people will
start level one chars here and there then forget about them) Well
people with mules got panicky and later verant decided not to do that
after all I think.

400,000 continually subscribed month to month accounts with say maybe
at least 6 characters per average per account or more on different
servers = at least 2,400,000 chars (did I do that math right?) Thats a
lot of space even if each char is a small file.

Verant is kinda smart in never deleting though, it makes it more
likely that someone will come back in 18 months ;) Just out of
curiousity though, there is no way to TELL if your chars are still
there except resubscribing right?
