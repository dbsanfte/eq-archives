d00dism is a mentality you'll run into on any number of online games
the fact that you don't understand is a very good thing for you. Don't
bother trying to understand anymore then trying to get into a serial
killers head. d00dism has a sociopathic element you'd have to "be
there" to understand.

We had a d00d in my guild last week who bragged about KSing and
training on people and went on to brag about how he mouthed off to a
GM who called him on it and all the run-ins he has had with the
"fuking GMs".  BTW, this is why I get suspicious of players who
complain about GMs, he had the balls to bitch about how the GMs hound
him after all his "non-sense" was self-cataloged for all of the
guildmembers on at the time to see. Sadly for him I had my log running
and sent the file of his little informative chat to the guild leader.

Bah-bye
