Basically, the greatest good for the greatest amount of people in your party
:p

How many times do you hear someone say 'good heal!'...quite rarely.

In a game where things are trying there best to kill you, you have to expect
death sometimes, no reason to feel bad about it, just sometimes there is
nothing you can do.

Afterwards you might think, what if I had done this, or that?  But in the
heat of the moment, things are different.  Do your best, people can ask no
more :)
