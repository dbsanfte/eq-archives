Just to be clear, I have never once charged for a spell (L31 Wood Elf Druid);
however, I do make it clear that I accept donations for tps, and don't refuse
offers of donations for other spells, and if asked why I consider it worth a
donation, well, spells cost money. Casting them costs mana - a port is 300 mana,
plus I have to get back to where I was, or get to wherever I am going, which is
rarely where the portee was going.

That said, I have never accepted money, even for a tp, from a character under
level 15 unless it was painfully obvious they had it to spare, i.e. a level 3
cleric wearing a full suit of (pulls a word out of a hat) Lambent, for instance
(can clerics wear lambent?).
