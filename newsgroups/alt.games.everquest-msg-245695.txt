My character has a Stein of Moggok, which has a number of light healing
charges, (27 hitpoints per charge). I handed this Stein to a low level
necro, and he has used the charges. Thought there were 3 charges.

I am also wondering whether its possible to re-charge a Stein of Moggok.

Anyone?

Maarten
