Just as with the so called "law's of the land" in part it must be a
reasonable for those it effect's and accepted as being the right way to do
so. I feel to enforce this "bottom post only" is as unreasonable as many of
the more resent "rules" some are coming out with.

Possible more important it transcends the "US/English" definition because of
what jurisdiction those civil authority's are from. Granted most of the
server's that make up the backbone we consider the internet are in the USA
but as the internet is worldwide we need to consider that before making
rules that are USA/English "proper" rules.

>  I assume you would accept laws as 'real rules'?
Yes, any reasonable adult would.

>  Does it

Yes, and no, as the rule is partially based on the person or party
establishing it. Yes, but the rule to only top post or only bottom post can
only be enforced using the proper English writing rules. The rules don't
apply in about 78% of the rest of the internet. Example, USA has a speed
limit of what is it now 75? I've had the pleasure of a Lamborghini and 160.
Can you enforce this 75 on me?

Perhaps you missed two key lines of this text. let me copy and paste them
for reference.

"This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind"

"This memo is the product of the Responsible Use of the Network (RUN)
Working Group of the IETF."

Thus this is a guideline only not rule.

Actually I had (and have) no intent of arguing at all, As I've been bashed I
respond with the point of error in the action. As I read the first few
responses to my simple genuine question I found a strong distaste from the
general attitude of a few "regulars" being more of a "better than you" blow
off then any sort of a helpful type of "hey, you know it sounds good but
it's not because....". Take this "42" and the 4 post's in the first few
hours of my post. All were negative and full of bashing myself for the
question and left me with the impression that should 42 know who I was the
account would be shut off as already convicted of buying the plat. There was
others but that is my point. I don't see it reasonable to act like this. To
turn and try and enforce an misguided rule from a FAQ instead of a
reasonable answer to the question is a sad example of the players of
Everquest. I read one user even plonked me for saying the "rule" wasn't
right.

Actually in a major way I already am,
1) I've been bashed in post's for my question.
2) I've been "informed" (feels more like insulted on this end) as if I was a
internet newbie of so called proper newsgroup edicate. ask a question and
get corrected instead. Great stuff.
3) I've been plonked by at least one guy, thus surly encouraging me to go on
with learning this new game.
4) I've been provided with a sure place to go to when I have questions about
the game! NOT

Tell you what, I post pretty much as I have since the 80's at the  Labs in
New Mexico, yea, I've been netting that long. You really thing some
insulting little guy that cant answer a simple question is going to get me
to change that? This was not referring to your post as I feel any question
is a good one because it takes gut's to ask in the first place.

I don't.

Again, why should I change anything about me for such piss poor attitude's
and childish treatment? Better to drop this newsgroup, or even throw out
these disk's and save the money from the account. I'm not that hooked.

So they pay for there's and I pay for mine. What are you claiming the
reader's right's supersede mine?
Bullshi_! The only ones making rules for my connection is me and my service.

Not in many of the newsgroups are you? I've been bashed for my handle and
not providing my email address. In one, every time I post a comment or
question one guy post's a notice that they address is fake and I'm a coward
for not using the right one.

> Mine works, is not munged, and I delete over 100 spam emails a day.
Mine's not and I don't waist that time deleting message's I don't want in
the first place. See I learned back in 89 or so that to provide the address
gives some the idea they have a right to say something to you. NOT!

Well there are those out there now that are insisting that you have to use
the right one, you will see it soon as it is a growing trend. The point is
the same, it's a right of choice not a rule or law. If some in here feel I'm
to be plonked or otherwise treated bad for this so called rule violation
fine, I'm above that and they need to grow up. I will post as I see fit,
perhaps I will delete this group as the only youngster's I want to deal with
are family.

This is a real good way to attract new people....give them your "rules"
(expectations should be used) before they post again. It's like creating an
index before posting any images in a newsgroup. Basically the rule is to
make you work harder so someone can pick what they want to download before
they do so. You still have all the rest of the work to do just they don't
download what they don't want.
