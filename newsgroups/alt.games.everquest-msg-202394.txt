It's not that they suck before level 30, but at 30 they gain 2 really
useful abilities that open up new avenues for them (in my opinion) ...

(1) Feign Death -- pulling technique and get out of jail card all in one.

(2) Invisibility -- SKs tend to be KoS in a lot of places. suddenly, hoofing
through zone X is now a reasonable risk.

It's kinda like that sweet spot bards hit in their mid-twenties, when they
get pbae fear, mez, charm, damage shield, and targetted dot. Suddenly
the world gets a lot friendlier...
