I just upgraded to XP from ME and the game runs smoother than ever. I played
last night in ill omen in front of
the fort where the lag-demons spawn ;-) and had almost NO LAG!  Also, the
graphics seemed a bit clearer. The
swaying trees actually looked like they were swaying in the wind, not just
rocking back and forth! In my eyes,
the stability alone was worth the upgrade, not to mention all the other
features. I used to think that ME was as
stable as windows was going to get, since going from 98 to ME didn't do much
for my system, but XP is way
above ME, not just a service patch in disguise. Plus, if you go to your
local Best Buy, they are running a deal
on WinXP.... Mine offered free memory (128 pc133), a free Diamond Rio MP3
player, a free music CD, and a
couple other cool items (of course using their infamous rebate system on all
but the music CD)

I was always the last to upgrade, giving MS 6 months to work the bugs out,
but I am glad I decided to jump now.

Also, built in DVD support is MUCH better than it was. The DVD's in real
player run SMOOOOOOTH!
