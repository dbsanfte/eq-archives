It's not so much that I don't see it happening, but that I don't see it 
happening soon enough. I think that the idea of the nation-state was 
already a bit rank by the end of the 19th century, and it's a shame that 
it has survived the 20th.

A less charitable soul than me could argue that Americans in general are 
wary of the European Union because a united Europe is a lot more of a 
counterbalance to US hegemony than a disconnected bunch of separate 
nations. Of course, *I* would never say that, but I'm curious to hear 
what separated European states can contribute to the world that a united 
Europe could not. I mean, it's not exactly like the first things in the 
agenda of a federal Europe would be to shoot Almodovar and ban French 
wine...
