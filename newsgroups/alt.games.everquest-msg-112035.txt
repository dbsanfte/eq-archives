I despise video game music.  I always shut it off.  Generally I don't even
know what the music to my favorite games even sounds like.  This is one
thing about EQ that pisses me off though.  I've shut the music off, but I
can always hear it faintly in the background when the volume is up.  Is
there any way to absolutely shut it off?  Not only do I hate video game
music, this game is enough of a resource whore where as I'd like to keep
this off to alot processing power to other aspects of the game.

Thanks in advance,
SEAN...
