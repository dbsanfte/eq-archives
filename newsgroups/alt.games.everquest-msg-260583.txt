I was asking around in serverwide.age about my few disciplines, 
wondering which would be best to use between cleaving anger (every hit a 
crit) and inspired rage (every swing a hit) [which I still think is an 
interesting question], when I mentioned also having Reckless, which is 
an auto riposte discipline.  Several people seemed to think that it 
would be best to not use either of the other two so as to keep Reckless 
in reserve for emergencies.

Well, to my thinking the only time I'd use any of the above two 
disciplines would be on boss mobs, and that by the time a boss gets 
around to beating on me in a raid situation, 12 seconds of autoriposte 
aren't really going to help too much.  I can see using it strategically, 
but not as a "hold in reserve" thing.

So when doing the Vindi fight yesterday, I burned Inspired Rage on my 
assigned target, one of the Temple Guardians.  Much to my suprise, when 
I got over to Vindi after taking out both TG, I saw that Reckless wasn't 
greyed out.  And a bit later, when I was dying from rampages, I used 
it... which turns out to be useless because it doesn't riposte rampage 
hits, smack in the middle of my 12 seconds of glory I took 3 700 point 
hits on my already near dead person, and went out like a light.

But my point is, I didn't have to pick between one of the two damage 
output enhancers and Reckless, because they aren't on the same timer... 
and because I had plenty of Endurance to run both.

Actually I've only tried this with Inspired Rage and Reckless, so its 
possible that Cleaving Anger will use up too much End to let me do 
Reckless... I'll have to experiment to be sure.

Assuming it works either way, then is it better to

A) hit every swing.
B) crit every time I hit.

I think A), because I'm only using it on boss mobs, and thats when I 
have trouble hitting.  If I'm hitting only 40% of the time, then hitting 
every time will take my damage up 250%.

B) will approximately double my DPS, as crits seem to do twice what the 
damage would have been.

So I guess its a judgement call, if I can hit the mob more than 50% of 
the time, then B is better, but if I hit less than 50% of the time than 
A is better.

But another thought is that hitting every time creates fewer spikes than 
hitting normally and doubling damage; I'm more likely to have the target 
turn on me if I get a lucky run and do 5 crits in one round (double 
attack plus triple frenzy, all at doubled damage?  I could spike up to 
1250 damage in one instant)

And another thought; with Inspired Rage running I can still get crits. 
I can't get crits above and beyond the every hit is a crit level if 
using Cleaving Rage.  Assuming both would theoretically come in even, 
say if my hit/miss ratio was exactly 50% (hitting every time would be 
100%, and critting every time would be doubling the 50% hits damage), 
I'd still crit some with Inspired Rage, adding a 2.5% edge, which isn't 
much but tips the scales.

If I was a warrior, or if berserkers went berserk (odd that they don't 
IMO), then I'd want to wait till damaged enough to go berserk, and then 
hit B, so I'd automatically Cripple, which I think triples damage output 
instead of just doubling it.  It would be hard for Inspired Rage to 
compete with that, I'd have to be hitting only 33% of the time.

I'm far from an experienced melee person, though, so you tell me what 
you think.
