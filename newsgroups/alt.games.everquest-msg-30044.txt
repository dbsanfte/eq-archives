I did 26-29 around the "brute caverns" under Warslik's
Woods -- the ones that are on the way to the Dalnir
entrance.

NOTHING aggroes down there, you can go sit next to a
Brute and med, and it'll ignore you.  When you're fm/fh,
stand up and kill one.  Repeat.

If things get hairy (no pun intended), run for the
Dalnir entrance and zone in, then zone back out --
the Dalnir zone line is safe, unless someone has
just trained something out, which isn't too terribly
common.

WW is an "outdoor" zone, so even though the Brute
caverns are "underground", you can still use all
your outdoor spells there (SoW, etc.)

The Brutes are safe, easy exp, but a bit monotonous.
When you get bored, step into Dalnir and join a group
fighting in the room near the zone, it's a lot of
fun (just don't go deeper unless you want a lot
more risk).  Or step out into WW and grab something
to pull back into the caverns to kill.

When you need to bank or buy supplies, the shortest
route is through the Iksar tunnels in WW (invis yourself),
which zone into the goblin tunnels in LOIO.  You should
know your way to FV from there.  eqatlas.com has
good maps of the Iksar/Goblin tunnels, but basically
you take every left going from WW->LOIO, and every
right on the return trip.
