I'm running a little baby berzerk around, and have been playing with his 
Frenzy skill, can't seem to figure it out.

It is a skill, similar to kick, which has to be hotkeyed periodically 
when its timer runs thru; like kick it gives an attempt to do damage to 
the target each time it's used.  Also like kick, its on the same timer 
as Kick and Slam, use any one and the other two also grey out for the 
same time period.

At the moment, it does a lot more damage than Kick; I'm doing 6 points 
at most with kick, but 20 at most with Frenzy.  Moreover, quite 
frequently Frenzy hits twice for up to 20 points per hit with a single 
press of the hotkey.  It also does less damage randomly, but never more 
damage; the highest damage I've seen from a press is 20+20=40 total. 
The double hits are often for two different amounts; 17+16, 20+11, and 
the mob hp total seems to drop correspondingly, so I'm pretty sure the 
double hit is not an illusion.

Like kick and slam, it only works from melee range, and it can be used 
without activating autoattack.

Damage from it seems to be a fixed maximum; I changed from an 8/32 
weapon to a 6/31 weapon and to a 22/40 weapon and still got 20 maximum, 
and no readily apparant change in the number of times it got less than 
maximum, nor in the point spread there.  Delay also seems fixed, 
regardless of the wide difference in delay in those tests (31 versus 40 
is reasonably visible)

I also went from level 6 with a skill of 6 in frenzy to level 13 with a 
skill of 50, and have seen no difference in its use, it seems to hit 
roughly the same amount of times (perhaps mob difficulty scaling up has 
something to do with that) and certainly to do the same amount of 
damage, only caveat being that perhaps as skill goes up I'm seeing more 
doubles, then again perhaps I just didn't notice them at first.

As a Berserk I don't get Double Attack till 15, so raising skill there 
is not what's responsible for double frenzies.

If this is all there is to it, then its a nice little toy at low levels, 
and little more than a blip on the radar at high levels, where an added 
20 or 40 points of damage every 6 seconds isn't going to be noticable at 
all!

Grage, 13 Berserk, Luclin
