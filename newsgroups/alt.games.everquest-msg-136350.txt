With all do respect I would like you to look. The oldest county with
writing, china. The oldest recorded history without the bible, china. With
the bible, isreal. Look at egypt and palestine today, im sorry but they are
not black. That is nation of islam dogma, north africa and the middle east
in particular are people of color but not black, that is a catch all term
for non white. If you look at another continent in equal portions to africa,
south america, you will notice with climate and position these continents
should be about equal. I was in south america and found out the first blacks
to there where brought in on slave ships. It is not climate, it is most
likely soil and food. Africa is the only country with a black eagle. Pure
not a white spot on it. I am not racist at all, but please dont spread pro
white or black here. People make their own choices and some chose to do
nothing with their lives. By the way, the most racist person is a black man,
blaming the whole world for his misfortune. I have heard it with my own
ears, that the black man for all the years of slavery that the white man put
them through, that the black man should go and sire black babies in white
women. Where did that come from? The same place that teaches that the black
man is the original race and that white people come from monkeys. The Nation
Of Islam.
