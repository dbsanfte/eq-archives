Hence the need to set precedent that I noted above which some folks
just ignored.  SOE has maintained that *they* maintain rights to 
those virtual monies.  If that is found to be the case, then the
scammer walks - and there is ground to consider what Yantis et. al.
do fraud as they are selling things that aren't theirs.  If the
courts find the other way, what does SOE do when they ban someone
and are sued because that person lost virtual property?
