Yes, but this doesn't work on PvP servers, since another guy can easily cast
a DoT on you outside of any PvP areas, and you'll die and lose exp without
them once laying a finger on you (other than the DoTs, of course).  Another
way to lose exp on PvP servers is if someone attacks you to wear down your
health, then train you with a KOS mob, and let the mob get the finishing
blow.  Had that done to me a couple weeks ago =/

You also lose exp if you're killed by an even... don't think that applies in
duels and arenas though.
