Its also the only way (baring death) a melee can go to his bind spot... TL
can send you to specific locations, or your bind spot (can also send a whole
group to their bind spot at the same time, with 1 spell cast)

Thats the worst problem with mages IMO.. when i was still a noob, and
traveling invis on my magician.... if i agrod i was dead usually.
sometimes if i had sow i had a chance, but not a chance because of a spell
my class gets..

If i got jumped while i was making a pet, i *had* to zone or gate.. that
sucks ass.  Most other classes had a spell (blind, fear, root, fd, snare) to
at least give them some prep time.. but at the same time my mage can solo
stuff my monk couldn't at the same level
