"He" refers to Sika.  Maps by Sika.  Japanese mapmaker extrordinaire.
Old site has closed down now, but they used to be the most detailed and
beautiful maps around by far. Another one for good fast maps was Hoppas
of E'Ci.

eqatlas is missing a few of the high level zones, probably because the
poor guy spends so much time making the maps that he doesn't have as
much time for levelling. Either way, it's by far the most comprehensive
UNIFORM collection out there, with good 'points of interest' notes, most
areas within the zones labelled, level of the zone/areas, loot, mobs,
and a little general flavor and hunting advice . EQMaps I have to
download several different versions of varying accuracy and detail, and
of varying quality, then load them into a viewer. EQAtlas is always my
first stop for maps. If they don't have it then I look elsewhere. If
they so pay-site, they are one of the few sites I'd consider paying for.

(ps: eqmaps has no maps for Cazic Thule, Shadeweaver's Thicket,
Sleeper's Tomb, and Vex Thal (if you want to be picky <grin>)
