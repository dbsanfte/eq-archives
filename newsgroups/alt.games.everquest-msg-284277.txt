When I got hooked up with the internet in '97 my big thing was Quake2.
Man those were the days....Weapons Factory, Lokis Minions Capture the
Flag. No game since has captured the smooth run and gun style of the
Quake2 shootouts.

My problem was being on dialup and not being able to ever compete with
the people on the new "cable" modems or the ISDN people. (DSL wasnt
around yet).

So from there I went to Diablo2 and eventually it was overrun with
freaks and a friend of mine who was working at my vets office said I
should try EQ. This was in january of 2001 so I gave it a try. It was
pretty cool! I have always been on the Luclin server. Started out an
Erudite enchanter (whom i subsequently got to 65....lol...I remember
getting swamped with 30 people when selling C3 once). I played until
spring 2004 when life carried me away from home (travelling on the road
as a consultant)

I relocated in spring 2005 and built a new computer and got Eq2. played
it a little bit....got a cat hunter to 12 but never knew anyone or got
into it much.

Then I got WoW and played it from may of last year until spring of this
year. Done it all by then. In the same time I got City of
Heroes....liked it but its pretty static, got CoV on halloween but
stuck with my Wow guild.

now wow guild is disbanded and I'm just disillusioned with all the
grinding/item lust that goes on in games like that where you A) are
dependent on a large guild you have to buttkiss your way up the ranks
in order to participate in the content or B) run into the brick wall of
level cap and start over with another class. CoH, CoV doesnt have item
lust but its rather shallow for a plot.


Ok, so back to EQ....where grinding and item lust were king. I had 2
accounts....a character of each class, most in the 40s and 50s. When I
left I had base Eq, ruins of kunark, scars of velious, shadow of luclin
(man those were the days when Luclin came out), planes of power,  Lost
dungeons of norrath and some small expansion with fish people.

What I liked about Eq was big worlds to explore, punishing experience
debt (as opposed to WoW idiots dying a lot....a LOT) and just the
general theme of environment and story line.

So since ive been out of it for a while....whats new? How has it
changed from the old days (remember running for your life when a
spectre gets trained on your group in Oasis?)

Then again maybe I dont want to return....the really cool stuff I
always wanted to see like Plane of Mischief and so forth is only
obtainable by spending countless hours getting entrance into an Uber
guild then countless hours grinding my way up to it. I am a casual
player now.....work and sports take a lot of my time but I really miss
the old days.
