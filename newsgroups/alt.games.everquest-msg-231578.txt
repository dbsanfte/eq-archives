Extemeism does change the point.  The example you gave is akin to
fraud.  Mine is akin to the latest Christmas toy.  Market value is
whatever the market will support.  If that's 20pp or 100pp it makes no
difference. If it's 20pp today and 100pp tomorrow it makes no
difference.  If it's 20pp for Paul and 100pp for Peter it makes no
difference.
Except to the person selling.

Price people charge overall is the average of the market, not the
market itself.  Market is whatever someone will pay.  It can easily be
a graduated scale and many times is.
