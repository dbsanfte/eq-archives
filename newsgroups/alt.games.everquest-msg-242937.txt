The FAQ for the newsgroup alt.games.everquest (AGE) can now be found at:

http://webpages.charter.net/lenny13/age.faq.htm

   I personally think that it's easier to check out in that format since I
can add internal anchor links to a HTML document while I can't do that with
a  usenet posting.  I will still post the FAQ to the newsgroup around the
beginning of each month.  But not again this month... I'm sure everyone is
tired of seeing that huge thing clogging up AGE.

  Any constructive criticisms happily accepted.
