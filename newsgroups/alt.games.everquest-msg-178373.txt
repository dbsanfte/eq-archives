Actually a story surfaced in the 80's that Komarov, who for those that
don't know, is the first man to die in a space mission when the
parachute on his spaceship fails on re-entry and the ship crashes to
Earth, was actually dead before re-entry due to a malfunction with the
oxygen. Since he was dead how can he deploy the chute.
The Russian Gov. covered this up as not to appear to the west to have
"lost a man in space" due to bad design , but by something that "was
out of their control".
