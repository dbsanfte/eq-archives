At low level its really not an issue, but having a fistful of hitpoints
allows you to leg it across a zone once spotted, im not thinking combat
ability but survivability under assault. Thinking about it more
it breaks down a bit because of the fact that Warriors are in many wanys
as bad as pure casters on CR due to no extra abilities though they can
damage absorb. Hybrids are defintely CR kings (rangers especially), rogues
are pretty good too.

OK my experience, limited though it is has been the other way round. Any
caster I have played has been comparatively more difficult to CR
with...simply because if things do aggro me it is another run in many
cases
