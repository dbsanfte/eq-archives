This only works if the people implementing it aren't chimps (or
tilting it in their favor).  I've seen badly designed DKP systems
where the "always there" raiders get a huge advantage of point
accumulation over the "not always there" raiders that isn't diminished
no matter how many items the "always there" raiders get over everyone
else.

This isn't the stereotypical example that everyone uses comparing the
7 day a week raider versus a once every two week raider (how on earth
would these two people be in the same guild anyway?).  I see this sort
of advantage crop up between a 7 day raider and a 5 day raider when
the point allocation is just completely screwed.

If I go to 5 raids to another guy's 7, I should be getting 5 pieces of
loot for every 7 he gets, if everything's fair. (Let's assume there's
no disparity between raid targets for the two of us)  In a lot of
flawed DKP systems, I'll only be getting whatever he doesn't want.
