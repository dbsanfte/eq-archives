Though I've done a fair amount of grouping, I'd say my monk has soloed
more than half his life, including some at all levels, up to his current
level 51.  It helps that I've earned enough plat along the way (enhanced
by bazaar trading) to pick up some good gear, most notably a Fungus
Covered Scale Tunic (15 regen augmenting my natural Iksar regen is huge)
and various Haste items (currently using a Cowl of Mortality, 36% haste).
I also use tribute for even more regen; I regen over 30 per tick in melee.
(I recall one recent fight where I managed to feign death at 0% hits with
a 20/tick dot on me, and survived.)

The way a monk solos is by heavy use of Feign Death, plus Intimidate and
the lull disciplines.  The lull can help pull single mobs, but that's
often not a big deal unless there are casters.  (Lull the caster, pull
the warrior, kill the warrior, go back for the caster.)  Casters are a
pain because their spells can interrupt Feign Death.

Standard tactic is to pull a mob off somewhere, beat on it, if the hits
are going down about evenly with mine use Mend to gain an edge.  Try to
intimidate it; if it runs while I'm feeling healthy I chase it and beat
it up from behind (so it doesn't block/riposte, let alone fight back),
else if I'm in a clear area I sit and bandage.  I can usually get three
bandages done before the Fear stops and the mob gets back to me.  That
means I heal about 300hp while it heals very little.  (Oh yeah, I can
also fire off the "healing will" discipline when I sit to bandage.)

But yes, soloing is still tough for a monk, and I often have to resort
to feign death to buy time for serious healing, or even to shake off a
mob completely.  Feign death is also useful when fighting a single mob;
if it runs (due to intimidate or low hits) and passes another mob, or
if an add shows up where I'm fighting, I can FD briefly, let the add
wander away again, then stand up and start fighting my target again.
Having sow potions or Jboots is also very helpful; it means if a mob
starts to run I can catch up to it.  (Otherwise, if I was at all slow
to react when Intimidate worked, the mob would run away and I'd chase
it but be out of range for most of the duration of the Fear effect.)
