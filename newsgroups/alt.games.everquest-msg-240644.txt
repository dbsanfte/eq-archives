An hour or two of farming in Innothule will still get you six stacks
of spiderling silk, in my experience.  That still doesn't change the
fact that you can sell the paddings for far more than what you lose on
making the same number of ornate pieces.  That may not have been true
in the past (on The Tribunal, paddings have near doubled in price in
the last year), or be true now on all servers, but it certainly is on
the server I play on.

Therefore, only an idiot would skill up on Fine Plate when they could
go Ornate Gold instead. ;-)
