How is that any more of an asshole move than the guild that seems to 
alwasy have a group on isle 7 in PoA farming mage crowns?  It's not as if 
the mobs won't respawn, and it's not as if they're preventing anyone else 
from going in and getting the drops themselves.  I could see if they were 
to attempt to claim the zone and not let anyone else hunt it, but farming 
doesn't have to equal monopolizing.
