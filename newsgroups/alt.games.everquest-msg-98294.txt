What interface improvements would people like to see next in EQ?  I
think what I would like to see is a quest journal that automatically
keeps track of what you've been told to do on quests.  I, and I suspect
many others, play EQ with the lights turned off.  It is a big pain in
the ass to try to read notes on paper.  Also, my desk is messy enough
without EQ notes strewn all over. :-)

Speaking of quests, I'd also like to see the triggers when speaking to
NPCs for quests made easier.  There are too many now where the trigger
requires an exact phrase that is not given in the text, and for which
most of the words have many synomyms, many of which are more commonly
used.  It's annoying to have figured out the gist of what you have to
say, but not be able to guess the right phrasing, and so have to stop
playing and go find a spoiler site.

One other interface change I'd like is better controls of the camera
position in 3rd person views.  I find that I play EQ in first person all
the time, and DAoC in 3rd person all the time.  I think that is because
EQ has better mouselook but lousy camera controls, and DAoC has lousy
mouselook but great camera controls.  I want both in both games. :-)
