I practice in Felwithe.  either main section of city at the back or
zone into the caster guild area.  Both have nice small water areas
that are perfectly safe.  

And, the safest thing to do is get a mage to summon some water stones
or get and enduring breath potion and you can't drown!

My wiz did the Staff of the Wheel quest and almost all the parts are
underwater in places that required enduring breath.  I just found a
mage and explained what I was doing and they summoned a backpack of
water stones for me at no charge.  I'm sure you could get some easily
and they really take the fear factor right away.  Being summoned they
poof when you log.

Also, from what I've heard, there are airless places on Luclin that
require enduring breath.

Have fun and go skinny dipping!
