Extend it to other games... It was the guys in Diablo 1 on BNet that
created a game called "legit players only" or something of the sort,
fired up his character editor and made himself level 50, made himself
a full set of the best armor and weapons, fired up a godmode hack,
then sat at the stairs into the first level of the dungeon and killed
every newbie that came down.

It's the same type of people as the monk I ran into on Paludal a week
or so ago that decided he wanted to hunt the outcast shiknars and FD
trained me 3 times -- of course, proclaiming his innocence first, then
saying "well, I always FD there. Not my fault you were sitting
there...", etc, etc while his buddies rallied behind him in /ooc...

"Gankers" are the idiots who's idea of fun is a one-sided fight. Who's
idea of fun is to ruin the fun of others and taunt them for being
"carebears" if they complain. Frankly, I find anyone who seriously
uses the term "carebear" as an insult only insults themselves. Just
like people who seriously throw around the term "n00b".
