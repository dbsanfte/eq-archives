as you get higher and higher level, and pets get faster, hasted faster, and
mage haste items,
they will break mez more and more.

My enchanter pet, my charmed pet, and my groupies mage/necro/bst pets break
mez ALL THE TIME.

Its all kind of luck of the draw. If the pet is in the middle of casting a
spell, or right before it casts a spell,
or right in the middle of/right before its swing. It will break mez. This
can happen on any pet and any level,
and is well documented and discussed on most enchanter messageboards (even
seen people talk about it over at the mage compendium).

Unfortunately, the pets dont break mez automaticly change has cuased a lot
of pet classes to get lazy, and not pet-back offf
a monster that is aobut to be mezzed. This is a good habit and you should
still do it, as a matter of habit (if your pet can back off) as it is always
possible that they CAN break mez.
