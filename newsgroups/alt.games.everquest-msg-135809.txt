Dont you think they are?  While the art is a lot more cutsie than I'd like,
I love being able to tell at a glance whether I that mind buff I have left is
C2 or GoM, that shield buff that started blinking is HB or Symbol or
Aegis, and so forth (OK, right now these are the only ones I"ve trained
myself to recognize at a glance)

For a druid, the new icons look like a huge improvement, no more
snaring yourself instead of casting SOW by mistake, no more casting
a Ring when you meant  a Circle... so many wildly different druid
spells had identicle icons before.  As a cleric, I rarely had that trouble,
only example I can think of offhand was getting stun and atone mixed
up from time to time.
