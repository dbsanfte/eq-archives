Unfortunately, none of these NPCs are likely to be untargetable.  In fact, many
of them are frequently hunted.

What this will help are GM events (which are often peopled by NPCs that are
supposed to give out quests and so forth... but instead turn into a bunch of
high level idiots attempting to kill the NPC in question.

Also, certain "environment" NPCs, like the "river source" in Warrens, or "pain
and suffering" or some reports I've heard of "clouds" and the Nexus Spires,
which exist to give localized sources of certain environmental effects, will now
not be vulnerable to attack
