I was trying to do this quest with my Halfling Druid. I am working on the 3
factions , by turning in lizard tails at 2 of the guilds
will also give you the third faction of Clurg . if you give to many to one
side first , it will make the other faction hate you more.

I was indiffernt in wolf form. took my Enchater at lvl 12 there, he was
apprehensive in DarkElf form. so I am going to wait till Enchater gets Orge
form spell

Charming it will not work. when NPC becomes pet, you can hand them anything.
Item will be lost.
Also there is a high lvl guard next to the quest mob.  I should know , I had
casted Charm instead of Alliance spell, and you can guess the rest of what
happened.
