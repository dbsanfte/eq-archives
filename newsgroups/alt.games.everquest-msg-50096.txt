I would agree as well.  Unfortunately, the things that are *most* appealing
for me in DAoC can't be implemented in EQ at this point in time.  It seems,
though it is still quite early, that DAoC might actually have a self
regulating economy where money comes in, money changes hands, and money goes
out.  EQ can't add item deterioration to the game at this point without
pissing off a large percentage of their player base.  For this same reason,
I don't think it would be possible to make trade skills viable in EQ.  Solo
ability and a severe reduction in downtime would also be difficult to
implement.  These are the things that attract me most about DAoC.  Other
ideas could be stolen and implemented by EQ, and I agree with you both.  I
hope they are.  It's about time this genre saw some serious competition...
both ways.

Best Regards
