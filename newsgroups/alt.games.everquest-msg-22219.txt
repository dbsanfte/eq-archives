>> "New" Befallen? I thought the change to Befallen was only a single-day GM
 event thing. Now what's up with the place? <<

The 'New' Befallen lasted about one or two weeks, I use to go there often.
Unfortunately, I could not get to the lower levels because they were fille
with 45+ level characters.

And by the time the pharmers got bored (or got everything they were looking
for), they went ahead and put Befallen back to it's original status. No more
DEs (save for the one SK), just skeles and rats and necros.

oh my.
