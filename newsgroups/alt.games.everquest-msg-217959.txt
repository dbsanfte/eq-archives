Oh come now Ben...now where would be the fun in that?  (c;

I already admitted that it was a moot point...for the most part, originally
posted to see if anyone else had seen that (got emails from other people
that have)...and yes, to rant a bit.  Posted the follow up for anyone that
was interested...and so the others that this has happened to didn't waste
their time.

It's not really losing the points that was so irritating, it was being led
to believe that it would be corrected.

May Tunare smile upon your path
