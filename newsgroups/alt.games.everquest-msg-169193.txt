I'm not sarcastic when I ask this...how do you know?  I was under the
impression that there is no "this mob has mitigated your spell" message,
that it requires a bit of parsing to figure out which mobs are messing
with your slowers.

But if I'm wrong, correct me.  A lot of what I'm talking about is hearsay,
because I have not visited the planes yet.  I don't think my shammy
husband and I could handle duoing there, and duoing is how we have most of
our fun.  (That, and our laptops are still struggling with Luclin...
drunken swagger of lag = dead duo)

I am told that a noticeable percentage of mobs in PoP that are not
mitigating slow are immune to it...though I believe this has been due to
the bugginess of implementing mitigation, not by design.   All in all, I
have no real better idea after your email how much slow mitigation is
going to hurt me (not as a shaman, but as someone who likes her mobs
slowed).  I guess I should take my curiousity to the Shaman's Crucible,
but I like the melee perspective as well.  They usually have no vested
interest either way, except for staying alive.
