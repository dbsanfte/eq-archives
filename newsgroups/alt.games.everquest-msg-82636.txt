If they become new human beings though the right technology, the we've
created new life.

Then we will be creating new life.  That doesn't change the fact that the
orignal life should not be killed.

I am not claiming that, nor would I have to.  The new life was -created-
when you split the orignal.

Neither.

Both are human.

Apparently in name only.

So, if you kill one twin, that's ok, the other twin will continue to live?
By discarding one of the cells, you are killing a human, which is -not- ok.

How does that matter?  If you kill some bum off the street, will I notice?
Probably not.  Does that make it acceptable?

One of the embryos died.  You took action that you knew would lead to it.
You killed the embryo.  The fact that you used natural processes to do so
does not make you any less guilty.

Nice trick, but it fails to look at the big picture.  Before you had two
embryos.  Both are alive, are they not?  Now you have one.  The fact that
you used a natural process to dispose of one of them is irrelevent.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
