No, you're typical - unless you did the BIOS upgrade back in October or 
whenever it was and had to downgrade it or use port triggering to get rid 
of the LDs every 15-20 minutes.

I have nothing against LinkSys, but there have been at least 1 major 
problem with LinkSys routers and online games ( the LD problem back then 
wasn't only with EQ ) whereas I haven't heard one problem from NetGear 
users with EQ.  There probably won't be another problem with LinkSys 
routers, but who knows?

The problem was highly publicized and caused non-technical people ( like 
the OP ) to have to do "technical" things.  If all the OP wants is 
functionality, then from waht I have seen the NetGear is the way to go for 
him.  If he wants a LinkSys, I have a spare 4-port he can buy at a nice 
price and there's a very high probability he will never have a problem with 
it.
