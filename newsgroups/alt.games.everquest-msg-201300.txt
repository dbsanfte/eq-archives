Don't be an idiot. There is absolutely none of that sentiment here, and 
you had no evidence to support that ridiculous claim.

No argument there. Is that what you want to discuss now, loot hogs? I 
can't stand 'em either.

Perhaps you were selling it to a vendor? Go to the Bazaar and sell the 
stuff and you can get anywhere from 10pp - 80pp *per stack*. Just because 
you aren't as well informed as you could be in your methods of loot 
liquidation, doesn't change the fact that SoW is too low-level and 
readily available a buff for which to require payment. If you think I'm 
wrong, make a quick run through PoK and stop at the bank and just ask 
politely if anyone would mind SoW'ing you. You'll obviously be surprised 
at how often it is cast without even an acknowledgement being required.
