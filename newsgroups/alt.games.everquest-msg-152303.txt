And in the low levels, those are fairly good "rules of thumb" to follow.
Later on you run into more and more mobs where the rules begin to change
for more reasons and scenarios than we have room here to describe. When
you get up to raid mobs, it's out the window entirely.

One of the best examples *against* the lowbie rules of thumb is that
there are certain mobs who will attack you just for sitting down. No
matter how many people jump on it initially to beat on it, and even if
you didn't cast a damned thing, they'll zero in on you first and smoosh
ya. You can't sit until aggro is *firmly* established and a lot of
damage has been done. 

There are even some who will leave the middle of a fight where tons of
damage and aggro have been accumulated to come pay you a visit if you
sit down. (Faydedar anyone?)

Anyway, in summary, yes... your plan outlined above works well at low
levels. However, as with all classes, the job gets more diversified and
complex as you go up.

The times you use AoE spells in a group, particularly in dungeons, can
be counted on one hand. It does happen, but it's damned rare. They're
more for quadding or emergency "save the group and do a Ranger FD"
situations.
