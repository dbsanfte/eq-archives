Oh, sure, I'd be happy too : )

It's no where in the manual, and the drivers don't ship with any cards.
 However, NVidia does make the drivers available for free from their
website.  Go to NVidia's home page at http://www.nvidia.com, and select
"Download Drivers."  You should be presented with three list boxes,
only the first of which should have any content just yet.  The last
choice, "Consumer 3D Stereo" is the one you want.  This driver works
with all NVidia graphics cards.  Select the OS appropriate for you and
click "GO".  When you download the drivers, make sure the 3D driver
revision number matches the revision number on your video card drivers,
or it won't work; as of March 11, the latest Consumer 3D drivers match
the revision of the latest video card drivers.  Download as neccessary.

Once you have the drivers downloaded, installed, and your system has
been rebooted, right-click on your desktop and select "NVIDIA
Display->(Your Display)".  In the left-side window listing, you should
see a new entry, "Stereo Properties."  Select this; I like to set mine
to "Enable by Hot Key."  In the past, other stereo types were
supported, such as your mentioned flip-glasses, but it looks like only
anaglyph is currently supported (I sure hope this changes with future
revisions; I was looking forward to using this setup in conjunction
with a lenticular 3D LCD display).

I recommend looking through the options under Stereo Properties.  Under
"Advanced Stereo Properties" is where you can set the hotkey to toggle
3D on/off (I like to set it to a complex combination of keys not used
in-game, like ctr-alt-f3).  Stereo Setup & Test is just that, and so
forth.

I hope you and others find this usefull.  Enjoy EverQuest in full,
glorious 3D!

As an aside, I'm suprised NVidia doesn't advertise this built-in
functionality more.  IMO, it puts their product well ahead of ATI
boards, and makes any 3D game that much more immersive without
requiring additional expensive hardware.  I'm equally suprised
Everquest, which is specifically listed under the suported games,
doesn't make better and consistant use of this feature; for example,
names and spell effects are 2D sprites overlaid on the 3D environment,
remaining level with the monitor's glass plane.  Old-world flame
effects, such as torches, follow their respective sources in the 3D
layer, while newer locations, such as Cabilis or the bazaar are again
2D sprites overlaid on the 3D environment.

Xiphos - As another aside, either groups.google.com needs to add a
"quote" function, or I need to pony up the money for a proper news feed
and go back to using tin.
