Theres so many possibilities that could cause this. What OS are you
using? Have you installed any new software or hardware since you
played last? Have you changed ISP's or connection methods (like added
broadband or a firewall or a router of some kind)? Yes, an old UI file
could cause problems. Deleting your OPT files will fix that if indeed
this is the problem. If this doesnt work, the easiest thing is to
uninstall EQ and reinstall and re-patch. Of course now is kind of a
bad time since LOY just went live and the patch servers will be
working overtime and the servers will be up and down for the next few
days likely.
