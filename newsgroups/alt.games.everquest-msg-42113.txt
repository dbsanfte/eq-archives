As a service member, I'll put some comment in here.

No, the flag is not supposed to touch the ground. Also, as a civilian, you
would destroy the flag by burning it in a private ceremony away from public
view.

If you have a flagpole, this is how you fly the flag at half mast: when
raising the flag, you first raise it quickly to the top of the pole, then
slowly lower it to half mast. When lowering it, you first quickly raise it
to the top of the pole, then slowly lower it.

Most military bases in the US will raise the flag at 5:00 AM and lower it at
6:00 PM, but it is at the discretion of the Post Commander as to the exact
times, so they may vary. Generally, you are not allowed to fly a flag during
nighttime hours unless there is a light shining onto the flag.

If I had the regulations nearby, I would tell you some other interesting
facts. Unfortunately, the reg is in my desk at work, and it's Saturday.
