I don't mind NBG so much but when the group makes it Class Specific I get a
bit pissed. I was playing my 59 Cleric with my Guild when the FT3 Booties
dropped, our Guild leader felt that these would be better suited to go to
Direct Damage dealers rather all that could use them. So the only ones that
could roll for them where 2 Wizards and a Mage, a Shaman and my self were
left out of the roll. Needless to say I was a bit pissed.
