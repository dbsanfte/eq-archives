That is where the diplomacy comes in. Bin Laden or his surrogates in Arab
governments have to be negotiated with. Bin Laden is expecting military
strikes from the U.S. This is what he wants. The strikes will give him and
his kind more warriors bent on destruction. Maybe next time it will be
bio-warfare and over a million dead bodies instead of a building?

Wrong, the U.N. has passed resolutions which have been vetoed by the U.S.
and voted against by Israel as the whole world voted otherwise. Where do
you get your news from Crazy Zionist Dan Rather? Until recently when Israel
agreed to sit down with Germany as mediator there was no other way to have
a negotiation as Israel refuses to abide by any United Nations directive
and will not allow international peace keepers on its ever expanding
territory. 

Why does the international community stand for this? Perhaps because the
Zionist occupied government of the U.S. gave the crazed, genocidal Israelis
nuclear warheads while Jimmy Carter was in the White House.
