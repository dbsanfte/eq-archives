Ok, I'm a DE cleric of Innoruuk and I'm trying to raise faction with
certain towns just for the sake of making my life easier.  I spent the
last 4 hours killing Orcs in EC and I think I got faction 60 times.  But
I don't think that affected anyone in Freeport.  I know to raise faction
with the guards, you need to turn in DF belts.  But what about merchants
and city folk.  What faction are they on and how can I raise it?  Also,
the only way I can see of raising faction in High Keep is killing orcs
and gnolls.  Is that it?  Do I have to do that until they're
apprehensive so I can turn in scalps?  I heard someone say something
about an undead area?  Not sure which.  It supposed to bring up faction
with the residents of freeport.  Any help in this area would be greatly
appreciated.
