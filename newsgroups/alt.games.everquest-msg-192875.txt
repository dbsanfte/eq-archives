THere is a fair overview and more importantly piccies on
www.legacyofykesha.com

But it in short adds the race and map feature you mentioned plus
Doubles bank space
Adds new zones on Dulak/Broken Skull Rock to go looking in
2 New spells per casting class quested in those zones
A bunch of quests in ODus and beyond relating to the zones
A guild management tool that is invaluable as an officer or GL
A LFG tool that is quite useful but needs more people with the expansion
Lizards are cooler looking than horses :)
