Tailoring will be less costly at first but more costly in the long run.
Tailoring is more profitable at a lower skill level than smithing. First
weight reducing packs can be made at skill level 40 and sell for around
20pp. Handmade backpacks can sell for 60 to 90pp and are trivial at 87. They
can be made with an acceptable failure rate as low as 75 though. Getting the
HQ bear skins can sometimes be a pain. In smithing banded is where you will
make a little money but will not be able to make it with acceptable failure
rates till around 100. High strength is also a factor in the success of
smithing and Elves are not really know for their strength.
