My bard is 53 half way to 54 and I can tell you that FT items do work.  I
have a Solstice Earring, but at the same time getting mana back is still
very slow.  I guess if I have a few more items with FT on them it would
greatly help with mana regen, but like you said, it can cost a lot of
platinum, and that money can go to other needed equipment.  There are a lot
of high end items that are no-drop that are bard only with very nice stats
and FT on them.  Abalone Engraved Tribal Mask comes to mind, drool.....  Do
a search at allakhazam's site under equipment and put in bard and select FT
as the parameters if you haven't already.  My goodness are there some nice
items.
