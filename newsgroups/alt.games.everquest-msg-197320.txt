The idiots will hang out near the zone line, just like in every other
zone in the game. If you don't like it, here's an idea. MOVE TO
SOMEWHERE OFF THE BEATEN PATH. I'm sure someone with your leet skills
shouldn't have a problem with that. 

Finding a nice quiet camp spot is trivial in any of the zones except
maybe for Honor and Tactics, I don't know enough about those two to
comment.

Actually, it should be as quiet as LoIO is these days <g>. I can't
help but think that it couldn't be any worse than current population
of those zones.
