Yep, if you snip liberally, top posting isn't really problematic, merely 
mildly antisocial, and there's clearly no stopping you.  I don't spend 
much time trying.

But for new posters who may not realize they are going against the 
grain, I'll still give it a shot.  After all, it takes so little effort 
on my part to just put a line in saying "A) Don't top post"

Bottom posting really isn't any better than top posting.  Mixed top and 
bottom posting is pretty annoying, though.

Context posting is superior to any of the three, for long posts where 
you are responding to several different topics.  If a newsgroup consists 
only of short comments and responses, and short threads, then contextual 
posting really looks just like bottom posting (or top posting, but I've 
never seen anyone do contextual posting where each comment is positioned 
over the point its referencing.

Splendid
