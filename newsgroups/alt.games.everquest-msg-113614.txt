Okay, this is gonna mark me as an ignorant newbie, but I have to ask, what
is the Sleeper I keep reading about?  What does it mean he is awake and
such.  I haven't seen mention of this in game, but I have in here.  I figure
it's something higher level (I only have a 19 Ranger, 10 Necro, 7 Monk) but
it just all sounds so cool and mysterious I have to know.  Thanks in
advance.
