Well for starters he showing that 20% of the game did just outright 
quit.

Your entitled to beleive whatever you want but don't forget that paid 
subscriptions doesn't equal people online.

There are a *lot* of eq1 accounts still being paid but played a lot less 
or not at all vs what they used to be. 

Additionally DoN, in particular fragmented, the population... instead of 
all the afkers/idler's being in pok they are split between guild halls, 
guild lobbies, and pok, and so on - this all accentuated the feeling of 
'mass exodus'. The ever increasing use of instances also further empties 
the world of 'visible people'.
