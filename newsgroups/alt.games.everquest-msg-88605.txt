My wizard just recently reached level 16, and has 40 practice points
to spend. Should I put them into skills, or into a trade? Being as how
his INT started rather low (92 originally), he's had to learn to fight 
as well and has gotten Average at 2HB, so would putting points into other
fighting skills (1HB, Piercing) be worth doing?
