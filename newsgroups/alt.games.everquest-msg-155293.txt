I do a /who on people who ask me (because there's a guild I never refuse or
accept payment from, DBN, but I don't know all their members by name) and if
you're not in hiding (/role, /anon) and not in zone, I'll send you a
response whether it's a "no, sorry," "yes, for donations," or "no, but so&so
is."  If I'm getting inundated by beggars I may not respond at all.
