This is pretty buried by now, but again, its Soldiers of Tunare for the 
druid epic; Faydark's Champions is just wood elf ranger faction.

Muffins to Pandos will fix it after a few million muffins or something 
painful like that.  As a halfling you can sneak behind him to do the 
turn in no problem.

I'm not sure why someone would have trouble with the guards, since you 
can invis to Pandos and sneak behind him before uninvising; there are no 
guards nearby him.  But if you really insist on an ultra safe 
environment, you can pull him over to the muffin vendor (or wherever you 
prefer), root him there then zone.  He'll stay put if you keep hailing 
him every once in a while.
