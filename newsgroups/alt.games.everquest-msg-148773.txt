LOL, Hear me now and believe me later..LOL, ROFLMAO
Go ahead start flaming the Guide, for repeating what I told you
a while ago. LOL.

I told you guy's CS was going to go first then all resouces were going
to get transfered to SWG and EQ2. I even "Proved" to two of you in
emails That I did in fact work at  Sony , but did you ever post on AGE
that I did, Nooo. Why, because you would lose face I guess.

Well, hear from the guide who already has proving to have worked
here...


Later Losers.

P.S. Keep sending your paychecks to us. I need to buy a new car.
