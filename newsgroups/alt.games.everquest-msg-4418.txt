I have searched every internet site.  From the the EQAtlas and other sites I
have a pretty good idea of what merchants in general sell.  Does anyone know
of a comprhensive list of all merchants and what exactly they sell.

    For example I need to buy 6, 30 level spells for my Paladin,  I know
there are merchants in Fiona Vie who sell Paladin spells do they sell the
ones I need.

        Its not really necessary but a lot of time it would be a real time
saver.
