Mine is there, because I was raised on the (good) netcop philosophy:
don't just hide from spam, LART the bastards.  Any business that sends
UBE or UCE to my inbox is boycotted, blacklisted and TOSed if
possible.  

(The bad netcop philosophy is 'also try to TOS the trolls, kooks and
guys who just disagree with you.  Dumb fuckers ruined the reputation
of a noble cause.)
