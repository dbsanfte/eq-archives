I got rid of flashes after doing following tricks:

1. Disable AGP 4x from BIOS (if you have VIA chipset motherboard, might help
with Intel chipsets too, not sure though)
2. Enable cool bits on NVidia drivers and then in Display
properties->Advanced->Direct 3D Settings, set vertical sync as disabled.
