Oh I've read plenty of posts. I know both sides.

We have Avenger who changes his personality faster than
 New England weather.

We have Melon who believes that he needs to pry into someone's
 life <bizbee> for his own sick self gratification.

We have you. Who thinks his mindless frattle is actually a coherant point of
argument. You're also a troll that has been KFed by probably 98% of the
newsgroup more times than once.

Hoist? Maybe, bizbee makes me laugh while you all try to impress
everyone with your borrowed wit. So I guess I'll "hoist" him.
