Most people allow for this. You should probably split any training points
you have among the skills you want to raise. Also remember that if there is
a 5 person group doing this they might as well invite you to the group since
it does not change thier xp for the worse, and if any of the rumors about it
spliting by the 5 lowest is actually true it could increase thier xp if you
are lower level than one of the members. (Even if true not really a
significant amount, but it is still free)

One thing to do is shop for the fastest weapon of the type you are going to
train reguardless of the damage, you want swings and lots of em. Then go for
DEX items and buffs.
