That was my thinking too.  PLUS: they all had the same guild tag.   Not always
a big red flag, (that's how I met *my* guild), but add the tag to the
attitude.... didn't take a brain surgeon to figure that one out.
In this instance, it wasn't at ALL about the money.  Had they *NOT* brought it
up right off the bat I'd have cast my group spell (as I always did in those
days because I had no idea what kind of crap armor / weapons strangers are
wearing and I *hate* people dying on me) and that would have been the end of
that.  
It was about Cleric Solidarity and the *point* of the matter.  Booting prior
cleric because he didn't want to pay 55 plat (or even 22 plat) to play in their
group was what riled me.
