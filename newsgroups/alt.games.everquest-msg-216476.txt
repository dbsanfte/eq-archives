I would definitely argue that.

SKs hold aggro like noones business- Better yet, they can FD pull, and pull 
with a snare which builds up a fair chunk of aggro right out of the gate. 
Having Snare also frees a slot in a group- I always try to have a ranger SK 
druid or necro in my groups for snare alone. If the MA can also snare, so 
much the better. 

These days I don't even look to a warrior for my first choice- their taunt 
is dependant on gear, and most warriors are not geared as well as the many 
twink pallies and SKs I see running around.
