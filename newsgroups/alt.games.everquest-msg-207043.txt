Well, thanks for the kind words, and sorry if I raise to the challenge. 
So far, I've personally lived under three different left-wing goverments: 
the Labour Party in the UK, the Socialist Worker's Party in Spain and 
the Red-Green coalition in Germany. I've visited France and Greece under 
their own leftist goverments, and I've friends from probably all the 
rest of them, so I think I know what I'm talking about here. In addition 
to that, I have lived in the US (and I loved my time there), so I know 
what to compare things with.

Now, would you tell me about your experience with European-style 
socialism and what makes living here so awful, in your opinion?
