Yes, you just "get" the skill at level 10....you don't have to train it.

The reason being.....bards originally didn't have meditate, but they added
it later on.  This was before Kunark came out and the highest you could go
was level 50.  Well, in a patch they decided to give bards meditate so that
they could memorize songs faster.....a lot of bards complained about having
to re-mem songs after death......if you've ever played a caster and had to
mem spells before you got meditate then you know how loooooong it takes.
Well anyway, when they added the ability for bards to meditate.....a lot of
bards were already maxed out at level 50 and had used up all of their
training points.  Since there was no way for them to receive any more
additional training points, they just made the skill a non-trainable
ability.
