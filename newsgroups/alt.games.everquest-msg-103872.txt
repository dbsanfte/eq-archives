Shaman from level 9+
Enchanter 16+
Mage 50+
Wizard 46+
Cleric 39+
Warrior 50+
Rogue 50+

I'm NOT saying that the other classes are less than useful, I'm simply
relaying what I've come to notice as most DESIRED in general.  Personally I
love druids in my groups (level 57 enc is main) though any uberguilder will
say they suck except as a taxi bitch.  Most intelligent people will take a
bard if they can't find an enchanter for crowd control but if you're under
some impression that level 60 players are any smarter than level 25 players,
get that silly thought out of your head.

Since Verant has totally nerfed the pre-30 game there's not much reason to
mention anything prior to that level.  From 30 until mid 40s pretty much any
combination works just fine.
