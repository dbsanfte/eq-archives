It depends on what you want to do. If you plan on reverse (fear)
kiting a lot, which this group would be pretty good for, and getting
around very fast when key areas are overcrowded with players (can
happen a lot these days) then I'd go with the druid. The druid can
also harmony pull ensuring that you only have one mob at a time (for
sure, unlike the cleric) making it not so needed that the sk takes the
time to FD pull and such. The large thorns the druid gets might sort
of equal the shaman slowing and quickening a bit also as far as damage
potential. This group would really be the best for me for the mobility
if nothing else. Besides all that, in an emergency you have evac
ability. Also I don't know what level you are, but a shaman does not
have invis other (or self) until level 29 while a druid gets it of
course very early.

On the other hand for head on fighting with quickening of the tank and
slowing of a mob I guess I'd go with shaman. Only problem is the 3 of
you will often be trying to get a port eventually. Shaman is also good
if you don't plan to limit it to just you three and plan to pick up a
porter or something in the wild when you can to round out the group
(preferably a druid one of course.) The larger buffs a shaman has are
really kind of inconsequential.

Add what each can do in your group up and I think you come to one
conclusion:

With the shaman the things that the druid can do will always be
missing, especially porting and evaccing. Meanwhile with the druid in
this group you will get by ok especially if doing mobs outside often,
you'll be able to switch areas fast and evac out of situations which
are bad. The shaman group would be missing what the druid can do A LOT
while the druid group might be only saying that a shaman would have
been better here in very rare circumstances.

I think that is what you should go by, which one you think you will
miss the most in regular everyday play.
