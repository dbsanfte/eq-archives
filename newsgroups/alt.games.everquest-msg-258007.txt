I have a sony 18" (not sure on the model, but it is the only 18.1 they 
make), 2 ViewSonic 171's, 1 NEC 17, and a couple of no name 17" at home. 
They all play EQ/DAOC/COH fine. I have one setup to watch video while I sit 
at a particularly borring camp. I have had no issues with refresh times.

If money does not matter I would look at some of the very new ViewSonic flat 
panels that have just been released they have really fast refresh rates and 
decent contrast (you want 400:1 or better or your blacks won't really look 
black). I normally say get everything mail order, but with these I would 
suggest your local Best Buy/CompUSA/etc. and get the extended warrenty. I 
returned one of my ViewSonics and one of my no named within the two years 
for new ones due to pixel problems, and it saved me the cost of all the 
extended warrenties and little extra for convenience.

If money is an issue go to the local store, and play a video sample on it 
and look for bluring/bleeding etc and compare colors then just buy the one 
that looks the best, again I would recomend the extended warrenty since it 
will usually mean you can take it back with just one dead pixel.
