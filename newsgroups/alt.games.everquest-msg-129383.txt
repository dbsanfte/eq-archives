I duo with my bard friend.  I've been staying in bear form with sow on.  On the
bard I buff: sow, strength, dex, inner fire, quickness, turtle skin, feel like
cat.  On the mobs, (we are currently in Mistmoore), I'm casting Malise,
Listless Power and Tagars.  On top of that I'm healing and keeping regen on
both of us, but especially me so I can cannibalize.  I don't get to melee much
using this because I am often low on mana.
This is obviously getting to be too much, even with his "mana song".  Which
spells  are *most* needed for him and mobs?
