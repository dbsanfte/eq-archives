Sorry about the lack of spacing I only noticed after I posted. She is a
Tunare worshiping Woodelf. I have a pair of splitpaw gloves I can give her
and I'll keep and eye out for some mana gear, thanks for the suggestions I'd
pass them all on. I'm hoping once she hits 24 or so to take her to Everfrost
and show her around there, as I've had much luck making money there.
