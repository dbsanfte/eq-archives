Well... you know I DO have other things to do.

For the record, I *AM* a druid --  high level and well respected amongst my
peers. One person successfully engaging and triumphing against four mobs "at
once" (note quotes). DOES go against how Verant designed the game.

These spells were designed to enhance group play and not to give any class
carte blanche to ruin the hunting of others. You can justify it all you
want, but the basic fact is you are inconveniencing at least three other
people/groups when you quad.

This game isn't just about filling up *YOUR* experience bar....
