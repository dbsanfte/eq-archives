I've got two warriors at 26 and I'm looking for new hunting grounds.  I'm
trying out Echo Caverns and Marus Seru but I wondered if anybody else had
some suggestions.  They're an Ogre and a Barbarian so short, small places
are to be avoided (I got so tired of ducking to get in and out of the house
in Unrest).  Thanks.

Clayton
