I have been having the same problem. I have checked with other people to
confirm that I am doing everything correctly. Yes I have gone back to my
home town and spoke to the appropriate NPC and received the appropriate
messages. When I hail any of the Wayfarer mobs, they just turn towards me
but say nothing.

I /bug and /petition, it took a few hours but finally got a reply to my
petition. The guide confirmed there is a faction problem with some people
and are not able to use LDON at the moment as faction is screwed up. You can
confirm this by conning the wayfarer mobs.
They all con dubious to me, but indifferent to my friends.

What really annoys me is that I got the impression that the fix for this is
not very high on their priority list, and the fact that they have my money
for a product that doesn't work for me. I'm sure if there was a bug that was
a benefit to the players then the servers would be taken down for an
emergency patch and fixed.

Guess I will just have to be patient and see what happens. I hope this has
cleared things up for some people.
