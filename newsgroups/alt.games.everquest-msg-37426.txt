It'll get better at higher levels, when it's not so easy to get a
couple levels a night :)
Still, I had a friend from my first guild who was 20 when I left the
game last November. When I came back, he hadn't been playing and was
21. When I hit 20, he was 24. Then, spring break hit and he went on a
leveling spree, getting almost to 40 before going back to school. He
was 41 when I was 33, 51 when I was 40, and now he's 54.
Another friend was 39 when I left the game and just reached 50 a short
while ago; he got one of those things, RL I think it's called :)

If you find good hunting partners who play at your pace, stick with
them; otherwise, don't worry too much about whether or not you're in
the same level range as all your friends, because you're not likely to
all level at the same rate anyway. And if everyone levels faster than
you, learn to be a pickup grouper (the art of finding a good one,
making a mediocre one a good one, leaving a bad or boring one).

I've leveled to 49 almost exclusively in pickup groups - I've taken up
partnering lately, and even *gasp* soloed a little, either root
dotting or single kiting with clarity/clarity II... if this continues,
I might even consider trying to quad kite sometime :)
