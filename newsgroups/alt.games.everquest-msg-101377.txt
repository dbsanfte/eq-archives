Point being that pre-kunark (which he alluded to) we were overpowered.
Now, we're underpowered, particularly post 50.  I just don't think it
is nearly as bad as the biggest whiners would have people think.

My top con Vocerate water Ks'd a 52 monk today.  I didn't nuke at all.
Did I mention he had the alternate monk epic ( the lizzy one ) ?

I have *NO* idea how, but it happened.

Like I said - at 51 our pets are still good.
And a decent level Vocerate will definitely out damage a 49 pet.
The level difference makes all the difference.  I was using my
49 fire while fear kiting in Maiden a week or so ago, and it did
no where near the damage of a good Vocerate pet.

Yep, like I said - high 50's, 55 and up.

I too have a great deal of hope.  I also love playing my mage still.
Today in the hole, my Earth pet had no problem's tanking an add 
crusader when LD's robbed us of the ability to handle the overpull
(Rock Golem, Flighty and the crusader).

He tanked, I nuked the Golem.  Cast one heal on my pet.  Nuked
on the flighty, then the cleric cast a cel. heal on my pet (I
was oom) and the melee's went over and finished it.  There's a
reason my guildies like "Spike" (my pets are always named spike)

Yes, we were all low 50's, high 40's.  The highest was a 54 ranger.
