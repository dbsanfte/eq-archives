Sonnet, I absolutely support you 100%.  The bottom line is that the
druid was not supporting the group to the best of his abilities.  Some
people want to turn this into a "Don't tell HIM what to do if you
don't want to be told yourself what to do" issue, but the essense of
what you're saying is, "Don't tell ME how to play a bard when you
obviously don't know how to play YOUR OWN class."
