Not talking about The Sleeper with 2 million hitpoints here. Just Cazel. If
you can't take him down in 2 minutes (disease spell duration), you can't
take him down.

Sorry there jeremy, but if this is really your arguement, then you are a
fucking imbecile. A 50 point disease DoT is a shitty low level spell. It is
shitty at the first level you get it, do you think that at level 45+ it
will have improved?

Only a simpleton uses an inferior tool when a superior one is available.

Who said anything about main damage dealer? The point of discussion is
stopping regen.
