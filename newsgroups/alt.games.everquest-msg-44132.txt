There is hardly "one" camp spot.  Entrance is camp when the zone is empty.
Once your group is a little more solid, you move in to the bridge where
pulling is easier.  That spot occupied when you come in with a group?  No
worries, go to the captain spawn area, or in to one of the two nearby golem
spots, if your group is more powerful, switch back and forth and take both.
More room needed?  In to the goo spawn area.  Easily supporting five full
level appropriate groups, any zone that can have 30 people in it all rocking
full time is pretty well designed.  What I don't see much is groups in the
deeper areas, but the "it doesn't matter where we camp, the good stuff drops
everywhere" plan sure does take care of the near zone camp crowding thing.
The only thing to reccomend the zone out camp is ease of escape... and given
whats often lurking outside waiting to tear into the almost dead escapees,
I'm not sure this is really an advantage.
