We've already been through this, but in a desperate attempt to get
through to you, I'll repeat it: recogizing the SYMPTONS of the disease
is not the same as understanding the disease itself.

Willpower is not always a requirement to get the ball rolling.  A
spouse, for example, can "force" their significant other to seek
help.

I don't disagree with any of this.  At some point, you have to WANT to
get better, and have the willpower to achieve it.  This is all common
sense.  I don't think I've said anything to the contrary.  I've only
ever really disagreed with your over-simplified "solution" of "just
turn it off".

Why do I disagree so loudly and obnoxiously?  Because your comments
might actually HURT people out there in the real world.  I don't want
someone who suffers from addiction to think "all I gotta do it turn EQ
off" when in fact it may be more appropriate for them to seek help.

You can do better than that.  I expect zingers that make me laugh out
loud.  Get on it.
