This reminds me of the time I made a PVP on a blue server.  Along
comes some high level player and he wanted to to dual me.  I said yes
ofcourse swung a punch missed and the guy just falls over dead. WTF.
I read up; the POD killed the guy in two blows.  All I could do was
LMAO at my screen and walk away.  So becareful when you /d someone.
