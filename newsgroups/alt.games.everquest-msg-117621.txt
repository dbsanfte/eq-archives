Nothing "wrong", per se, but wrong for you.

First and foremost, you're paying to have fun, and playing to have
fun. So, if you're not having fun with what you're doing, do something
different!

Ignore the rat race aspect of the game that so many people (including
me on occasion) get involved in. Don't go after some item because it's
The Thing To Have, unless getting it will actually be fun.

Figure out what aspects of the game you enjoy, and focus on them. If
need be, don't hesitate to take a break from the game for a month or
two - I did over the Christmas season, and had a lot more fun upon
returning to the game than I was having before.
