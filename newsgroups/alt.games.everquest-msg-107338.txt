As a cleric you are in a position most people are not; you get a spell at
level
39 that will be useful in encounters with level 70 mobs, and won't ever be

resisted... you'll get more spells that make you more useful as you level
up,
but its quite possible to settle for a low level cleric and still see
better healing
than any other class can provide.

Anyone who is going to be casting on the mobs, though is going to find
that the higher level the mobs, the more the resists.  Velks mobs can be
quite irritating to try and cast on.  They also have good AC and high HP,
and hit hard and fast.  Casters and tanks need to be relatively powerful
to
go thru them in any kind of speed and to accept the kind of punishment
they
will be handing out in return.

Velks is a high level zone one zone away from a wizard, druid, and Nexus
portal.  This makes it a natural congregating spot for the LFG (easy to
get
to, easy to get out of) and for those who are only on for a short time.
There are
certainly better zones out there for exp and for loot, but they are "bring
your
own group" zones, and take more effort to get to, and to get back out of.
Melee
can bind in nearby Thurgadin, casters in the almost entirely safe spot
right outside
the zone line, and yet there's good exp there up thru 60.

Personally, I"ve spent far too much time there, I'm -over- spiders and
statues
now, so I make a concerted effort to find something, anything else to
do... but
everything else does take more effort and time to set up.
