Don't want to start a flame war over which is the better race but, half
elves are not a cross between lions and hyenas they are just elves with
diluted and polluted blood from the humans that invade our country and rape
our women.  That or some even human female enchanter couldn't resist bedding
a elf.  Either way half elves are our brothers (step, red haired and all) ,
just not as good looking or honest as a true elf or as snobbish as a high
elf!  It could be worse someone might have crossed a human and a dark elf or
worse a gnome (now that is ugly!)!
