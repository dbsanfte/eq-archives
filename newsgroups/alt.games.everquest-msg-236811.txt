Firiona Vie (if you can get there safely) has always been a favourite of 
mine, mostly because of the sheer variety of fish to catch.  Watch out 
though, weight reduction bags are a must - some of those suckers are 
heavy!  PoK book, then invis into town.

East Karana was another favourite at lower levels.  Hunting until mana 
ran out, then med and fish by the bridge - no mobs wandering by unless 
someone trains.  Also some guards just along the road in cases of dire 
emergency.  PoK book and run to the northeast corner.

A place not to fish - Jaggedpine Forrest.  Cannot remember what infests 
the waters there, but they are root/snare resistant and vicious when I 
got caught (somewhere in my early mid 40's iirc).
