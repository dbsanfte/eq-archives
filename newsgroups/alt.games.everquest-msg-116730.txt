Well, while Druid can't buff attack speed, and they aren't the "masters" of
buffing, you have to give them their due. They *do* have the best SoW (SoE
if you aren't a whiner about bobbing up and down, it beats any other SoW,
lasts longer, includes levitate, infrvision, and see invis) they have the
second best DS, they have the 2nd or 3rd best AC buff, a Reasonable HP buff,
and Tied for first in Regeneration I believe.

If by "who has the best buffs" you mean... if I stand somewhere soloing and
a character walked up and buffed me whose buffs would make the most
difference... well... Druid would be near the top of the list.
