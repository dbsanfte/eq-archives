Why couldn't they setup a system where you don't actually have to be
logged in to run a vendor ?

I've recently just started playing EQ after many years of UO, in UO a
vendor is a separate toon, and you set it up by placing it where you
stand. The vendor remains in the game 24/7, even when your not logged
in. You pay an upkeep fee to keep the vendor going but it is there in
the game all the time.

It would certainly cut down on bandwidth and make the bazaar much more
efficient. I have a lot of things that I wouldn't mind trying to sell,
but I cannot run my system 24/7 and be logged in all the time with a
character setup as a vendor. After running vendors in UO for many
years I know that lots of things takes days or even weeks to sell.
Hardly feasible having to actually be logged on and "playing as a
vendor".
