To be honest, I really do *not* like the idea of instancing. I think 
that dealing with crowds is part of what a MMORPG is. Otherwise, it's 
just a single-player RPG with some co-op features bolted on. Besides, I 
shudder to think what that will do to mudflation...

Of course, that doesn't mean I won't be buying it... :-P
