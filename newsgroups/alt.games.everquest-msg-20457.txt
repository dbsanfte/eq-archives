I am a druid. The best way to insult me is to call me a drood/dr00d,
or to act like a dr00d around me.
I have noticed that some people will refer to themselves as a drood in
a 'good way' the same way some will refer to themselves as a dorf in a
'good way'. However, I think that more people make a skill distinction
between a druid and a dr00d than mean anything about a dwarf's playing
skill with the term 'dorf'.
