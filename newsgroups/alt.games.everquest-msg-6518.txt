Kind of glaringly obvious when he listed pocket avenger, wasn't it?

I have no clue what my flame/ontopic/chatter ratio is here, but at
least I'm much more ontopic here than I am in the other group I
participate in. I might do a bit more flaming there too, but not much.
(I am one of the oldbie primary flamethrowers there; I only need to
write a short, painful flame or two from time to time to maintain my
status :) I've seen others threaten to sic me on morons. It's fun.)

I guess it's a good thing I like chopped liver. (Especially sauteed in
brown sauce with herbs and mushrooms. Mmmm.)
