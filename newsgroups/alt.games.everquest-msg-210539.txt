The shaman epic can be done solo 95% of the way, and the final mob takes only a
mage and a cleric; the only "raid" part of the whole quest is the fear part...
and even then, I think a single group can do that part now.  But ignoring the
high powered ubers who can pull that off, still everything except the fear part
is trivially easy to do; my shaman has soloed his way up to the Fear drop and is
currently only 51.
