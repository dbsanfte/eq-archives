If you kill sarnaks you will get ok with LegionOfCabilis, then the bone chip
quest will fix all the other factions except BroodOfKotiz (necro). Its
better to kill the outcast iksar types instead of sarnaks, as they also
improve your BroodOfKotiz faction. There are 2 camps of 3 spawns in WW near
the fob zone that are good for this.
