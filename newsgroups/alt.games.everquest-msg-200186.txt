So why are you hunting deathfist orcs and trying these places?

As a wood elf ranger, who started in Kelethin, I am collecting Crushbone
orc scalps to take to Captain Ashlan in High Pass. Well, he takes them
from my wood elf bard, so no loss if he wont take then from my wood elf
ranger. (Hint, needed to invis and from behind with bard at first -
faction thing)

For the CD Belts and Pads (pairs only), I turn them into Canoe ??? in
Kaladim.


Have your tried a google search on the items?
http://www.google.com  and enter deathfist belts everquest. Allakhazm
probably has info.
