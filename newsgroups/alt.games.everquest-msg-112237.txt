	I can count the number of people who I have heard say that the bind rules
are "part of the enjoyment of the game" on my thumbs.

|So, you can't bind? Tough luck. I can't wear the same protective gear as you

	Every casting class except Clerics gets invis.  Every casting class except
Mages gets root.  Those two tools alone give you the edge in CR against all
the pure fighters and half of the hybrids.  Now consider that a naked caster
can still kill mobs, whereas the only fighter class that could even try to
fight naked is the Monk, and they'd probably still lose.

|Also, from very low levels,

|My caster is lucky to find someone to enhance their mana regen let alone

	What does this have to do with anything?  Yes, a fighter can be healed by
a priest class.  Then he gets to wait for that guy to recover his mana.  Your
point?  

|Not only that, you're sitting on top of mobs when they
|drop and take first loot, whereas my caster is sitting at a distance and,
|even when she does get a chance to loot, 

	Again, what does this have to do with the price of tea in China?  And for
the record, I only loot corpses when they're piling up and interfering with
targetting.

|she doesn't like to because that
|means wasting time recovering mana to help you ungrateful meleers, who won't
|stop your damn pulling because it means youre losing loot time.

	We won't stop pulling as long as the mana holds out for experience, not
loot, reasons.  You think I need anything dropped in experience groups?  The
only things that are going to improve my character come from raid targets.
