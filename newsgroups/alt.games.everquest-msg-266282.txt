My computer gear isn't all that impressive. I use wireless to get the 
network around the house, (for my laptop), but have Gigabit in my room. 
Not having DSL (which I would filter at the box... filtering at each 
phone is a pain) I have a dedicated ISDN line run to the computer room. 
  Though everything on the computer side is surge protected and on UPSes 
(I even surge the serial lines to some... special.. equipment.) 
Fortunatly the room has 5 circuits (amazing) and the adjacent rooms 
don't use their adjoining plugs for more than a few lamps.

The scary stuff is the opposite corner, where my ham radio gear is.
