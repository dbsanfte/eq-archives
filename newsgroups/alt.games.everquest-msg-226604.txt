Dunno...I have made it into EVERY (Everquest, LoE, SWG, Planetside) beta
test that I have applied for from SOE.  If it truly is a lottery, then I
should be buying powerball tickets as I may be the luckiest SOB alive.
Maybe I have an advantage in that I have done their betas in the past and I
am a computer/electronic tech by trade...or maybe I just answer the
questions better, I don't know.

Not really, it would be more like saying:  "Be the first to try the new and
exciting Coca-Cola XXX a month before the rest of the public does, stop by
our gas station, fill up with 8 gallons of gasoline and receive a free 6
pack as our way of saying Thank You for making Gas_Station_01 the tri-state
areas #1 fueling destination!"  Your argument doesn't hold water because EQ2
WILL be available in the future, you just might have to wait and pay for
your right to play the game.  I personally hope that I will get into the
beta rounds of EQ2, but having beta-played LoE there is no way I will
purchase LoE just for the rights to play, but if others do it, fine, doesn't
bother me, just gonna be less people in the lotto rounds.
