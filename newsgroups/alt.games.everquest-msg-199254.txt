My FV druid *is* a half elf :) (They can't all be wood elves). Mama
was a wood elf Tunare druid, papa was a wandering human Karana
paladin, baby girl was raised in Kelethin under Tunare's blessing and
wanted to be a paladin, but she didn't like the way those snooty high
elves looked at her. So, she's a tanking druid instead :) (Just wait
till I can afford to buy her plate/chain stuff...)
