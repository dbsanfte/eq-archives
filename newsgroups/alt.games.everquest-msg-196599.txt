At my level, with my pathetic mana pool, root is actually an issue that can interfere with a
constant pulls plan, absent KEI.  In the long run, or with KEI on, I'll probably go to root
instead, after all, it will keep seeming cheaper and cheaper as my mana pool grows with levels.

Or ranger, or beastlord, or mage, or necro... classes with high DPS that have higher DPS when
hasted, not a rare occurance.  Actually, so far I'd think rogue least of all, simply because their
high DPS depends on a MA that can consistently hold aggro.
