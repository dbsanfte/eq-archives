I have a ATI Radeon 8500 DDR 64 MB video card.  My driver version is
4.13.7191.  I am running Windows 98 SE.  I have an Athlon XP with 512
Ram.

When I swim underwater I can only see a short distance and about ten
feet in front of me all I can see is a solid black wall.  A secondary
problem I'm having is that all my screenshots appear very dark.  I've
tried adjusting my gamma correction in game and also boosted the
driver game brightness settings and still they come out dark.

Here is a screenshot as they normally come out.

That's me at the bottom.  As you can see this screenshot is so dark
you can't see the black wall I mentioned above.  I've brightened up
the screenshot so you can see the black wall better.

I've also experienced this black wall problem in Hate on the second
floor.  This is getting so annoying for me I just had to post in hopes
someone might be able to suggest something.

I've tried the other ATI drivers and when I use them my system just
locks up when load EQ and I can't even get in game.  I've fiddled with
all the driver settings and still nothing.  = (

At this point any suggestions or help would be very welcome.  I'm at
my wits end.
