Right from the horse's mouth. It's coming, it'll be based on the Terra Volta
trial, and there's no ETA but it's "a few months". It will extend across
many levels, not just the mid-twenties (must mean that TV will change its
L23 requirement?), and will be designed to allow a character the ability to
change throughout their career (implies repeatbility).
