No skill ups when dueling...else you could train your skill to their max
without killin mobs.

I tried this with my warrior against another warrior who con'd white, and a
cleric to heal. I tried to PL 1HS, Pierce, HTH, you name it, and nothing
ever trained.

You should try dueling drunk and naked HTH when both combatants skills are
under 50....lol about 45 mins for someone to win!
