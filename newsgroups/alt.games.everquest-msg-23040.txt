I'm closing in on level 30, at last, and I think I'm going to take it
really easy... Make money porting people, develop a trade skill and,
above all, travel a lot. I have a few questions:

-What is the safest and easiest way to lay eyes on a Dragon for a Karana
worshipper? I sent my little necro on a deathmarch to Thurgadin, so I
know that getting there is easy, but how about from there to the nearest
Dragon?

-I know that the positive faction adjustments of Wolf Form have been
nerfed, but do any of them remain? What places are rendered non KoS when
you are in Wolf Form?

-Any chance I could get myself ported to PoA, PoM or PoG at level 30, or
are they level-restricted as the others? Would a Karana worshipper be
KoS in PoG anyway?

-What are your favorite high-level sights in the game? Anything it may
be worth risking a death to see? 

-What items are there available to druids that have any kind of Illusion
effect? After the nerfage of Mask of the Deceiver, I haven't heard of
any.

All other touristy tips are welcome too...

Thanks
