My shaman at 57 solos quite well, thanks. My favorite places are the
entrances to sebilis and howling stones...HS is better, but if something
goes wrong, getting a rez is a major hassle.

The low 40s are a bad time for a soloing shaman, unless they have
absolutely stunning gear. Gets better at 45 if they have access to the
jaundiced bone bracer (hell, you could solo your way from 45 to 50 in a day
with the JBB), and 49 is a true milestone with the spell improvements.
