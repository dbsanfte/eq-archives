It was the other way around for me.  I saw the beggar walking alone staying
strictly on the path towards Kaladim for the docks.  It kept turning around
and staring and me and I kept stopping until it made its away again.  I
tried hailing it numerous times to no effect.  Finally it began to feign
death out of nowhere on the road and I just sat and watch.  It finally got
up and walked back to the docks with me following where it feigned death
again.  I slayed the bum!
