That agreement is LONG.
But I think Miï¿½ro$oft still beat them on length (and definitely beat them on
rambling).
According to the agreement, we give them permission to upload files FROM our
system?  I don't know of any time though when they have done this (unless
secretly uploading the eqclient.ini file to see what most people's preferred
settings are).

Also, what about the part of saying that we don't hold them liable for any
damages resulting from EQ?  Does that mean that the recent story of that guy
who killed himself over EQ, his family can't sue Sony over it, because he
agreed that they are not liable for any damages?

And then the part about not causing any heavy load on their systems?  So the
people who pile up corpses in a zone, causing allot of lag, are committing a
ban-able offense?
