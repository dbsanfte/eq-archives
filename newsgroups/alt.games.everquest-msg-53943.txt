Higher haste is better than higher strength.

Higher haste means more swings, which means more damage output
and (more importantly for a warrior) more taunt.

Higher strength means more carrying capacity (be pretty sad to
see a warrior with any problem there) and marginal improvement
in damage output...but no improvement in taunt level.

Too, strength gear is relatively cheap and easy to acquire, while haste
gear is much more highly priced.  Worrying about the possible str
that you could be wearing in that slot seems penny wise, pound foolish.

Caveat: Not a warrior... I just have to keep warriors alive for a living.
