He has look pretty teary and weak backboned during the teleplay.  He was a
national guard guy by the way just like Clinton during Vietnam and rumored
to have been AWOL at times.  I feel good that Cheney and Powell are there
with him because he'll need them.  I hope he does well but face the guy is
not too bright and thought Africa is a country.  They knew he weak in
foreign policy  and struck accordingly.  I hope he learns fast and dries up
FDR wouldn't tear up not would Churchill both good war leaders it might be
good politically for sympathy of bad for world respect.  C'mon Mr .
President toughen up and do your job!
