Max,

You my friend are getting a double whammy according to reports I have read.
You are using both an AMD and an ATI.  Though this is what my PLing system
carries (note, it isnt a fantastic system by far, but, using a druid to PL I
usually only need to sit to med or stand to cast one or two spells, though
it does move decently, I wouldnt fight with it of course):

AMD K62-350 @ 350MHz (Im not a big OC fanatic)
192 MB PC133 SDRAM
Mobo using Via Apollo 133a Chipset (running LATEST Mobo drivers, including
AGP drivers, might be your issue?)
Rage Pro (not Rage Fury Pro, I took that one out of main play system and
have yet to try it)
Windows 98 (IE 6.0)

Everything works just fine.  What I would suggest, if applicable, is
reinstall your video drivers if you installed Direct X 8.1 without
reinstalling them afterward.

While I may not always have the latest greatest hardware or OS, I always
keep my BIOS and Mobo (motherboard) drivers up to date, since those are IMO
the heart of all your computers efficiency factors not to mention
compatibility.

Jacobson
