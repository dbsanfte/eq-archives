VSR is eeeeeasy. I did him with pickup groups.

Warriors have a bitch of a camp in Sev. Almost as bad as ragefire - not as
contested, but every bit as dull. Our poor warlords sit in EJ for 6 days at
a time when its Warrior epic week waiting for a pop ;( Ick. Ick.

I waited a LONG time for my shattered emerald, but at least it was hours
of killing stuff in hate, not just sitting on my butt, and we generally got
some 2nd floor armour out of it, if no stone.
