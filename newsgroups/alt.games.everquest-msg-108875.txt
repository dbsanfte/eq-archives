Auction sites never get updated regularly enough to make them useful,
chances are the items you see there for sale are on out of date prices and
were sold long ago.

It would be nice if Verant could use a notice board system in game (there is
one already, you'll find them in Inns) where people can post sales and posts
would remain for a few days then expire. Posts could be sorted by class,
race, slot and notice boards in Inns, banks and plenty in Bazaar, with them
all sharing information.
This would make a useful interim until the implement the Bazaar trading code
(if they ever do)
