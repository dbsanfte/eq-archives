}The reason we can make long lines are for us to USE them. Just type your 
}auction once, and then use Shift and arrow up to repeat it when needed. 
}1 long line are a LOT less bothersome than 5 short ones. And in the 
}short lines, you cant get the stats on most items anyway due to lenght, 
}better to use long lines, i can du all my auctions on 7 items in 2 
}lines, including price and stats.

Perhaps, but being that I'm always /aucing in a lag-heavy zone, like gbay 
or ec, It gets to be a real pain having to retype that really long line 
when I get disconnected every 15-30min.  So, a hotkey or 5, and punch one 
when I'm bored.  Usually takes me more than a minute to get bored.  I just 
wish we could have reasonably long lines -in a hotkey-... grr, how hard 
can it be?  And then I wanna be able to edit hotkey lines...

What really works well though, is
/auc Trud gots 5 bags of junks to sells at torch 2! Come hails me to see!

}Oh, and by the way, when people use Shift and pageup to repeat lines, 
}you can use arrow left and right to edit the line. I still dont get why 
}people who know how to repeat an auction write "Legs sold" or something 
}like that at the end of an auction, instead of just editing the line.

Perhaps they didn't read the patch message when it came out? :) It was 
funny last night in gfay having someone -insist- that they'd lose exp if 
they died at level 6...  And then 5 minutes later, I can't remember what 
it was offhand, but someone else insisted that something else was the way 
it was before a patch from 6 months or so ago. :)
