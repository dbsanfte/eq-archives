Yes.

Yes I am.

Certainly.

I'm over 40 years old.  I've been programming computers, and been
involved in computer-related activities, since I was 14 (in the
mid-seventies).  Before the Internet as such was widely available,
I was on the nationwide multi-user Plato computer network, run by CDC,
which had been up and running since the late 70's.  They had their
own version of newsgroups, and even multi-user dungeon games that
were primitive precursors to EverQuest, like Moria and Avatar.

Also around the late 70's, BBS (Bulletin Board Systems) were available
as online communities for ongoing discussions (much like Usenet is
today), and they were going strong all through the eighties until the
blossoming internet finally made them obsolete.

Not everyone is as young and naive and ignorant as you are, youngster.

Because I'm a student of human nature, and I've been paying attention
to that subject for decades.  I've had, or watched, countless online
discussions with various flavors of trolls.  It doesn't take long to
notice the behavior patterns emerge.

Trolls like to think that they're all so original, but sadly they're
monotonously similar, because their behavior stems from just a few
simple personality disorders.

I'll let that speak for itself.
