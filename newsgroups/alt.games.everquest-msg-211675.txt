: I have more than a bit of a problem swallowing the idea people are making

: A quick scan of playerauctions showed just over $500 being the max price
: placed on an account with any actual bids, which was for a 65 paladin,
: 200+AA, elemental flagged, etc, etc, etc.   And 700 was the greatest price
: anyone was even asking, that I saw in my quick scan.

: Even assuming an unlimited demand of people willing to pay $700 for an

numbers

: 365 days in a year (assuming you take no time off to eat or sleep or

: Not to mention, if you were working 365 days a year, 24 hours a day at

While you would be correct if it were just selling the accounts, the normal
prctice is buying accounts and stripping them to sell items/plat  then sell
the account.  My gess is that if they can turn over half the number of
accounts (high-end) that you guess, they would be able to turn the 6-figure
profit.  And, yes, it's no longer a game, it's most definitely a business.
