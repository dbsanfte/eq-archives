Probaly.  On top of that about 2 server crashes a day since the
initial patch last week.  I don't know how often other servers crashes
but Maelin crashes so often one could almost schedule raids so it
begins just after server reboots.  My guild is probably the only guild
on Maelin who have personally fought with Emp Ssra more than once in a
24 hours period.  (Emp is on 7 days spawn cycle for those who don't
know)

They've had 7 years to work out the bugs and there are still a number
of unsolved bugs like the ships, some older quests (Luclin, Velious,
Kunark, and even original EQ), and begging noobs.  (I had the
satisfication of giving a level 3 monk 10k in coppers.)

I thought SOE had already released every bugs possible?  If there are
going to be new bugs, I'll bet SOE is trying to get ahead of Microsoft
for buggy software.
