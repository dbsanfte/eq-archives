I decided to take my level 7 half elf bard from Qeynos, to Greater Faydark
to hunt some orcs.   I ran to NK to port to Luclin then to G. Fay.  While I
was waiting some shouts porting for donations, not knowing if he is a Wizard
or Druid, I send him a tell I got 5PP can I get a port to BB or G. Fay.  He
says nope can't do that.  As I am waiting on the spires I accident hit my
DOT song, You have been hit for 2050 point.  Loading please wait . . .

A 55 cleric  saw this, and ressed me.  After a lengthy zone time, I'm back
just in time to see the message.  The spires will become active again in 15
minutes.  This time I did not memorize the DOT song. !5 minutes later I show
up in Luclin, and while waiting to get back to G. Fay a high level Necro
gave me Silver Plated Leggings +3 Str, +5 Sta.  My wait finally paid off.
