Well, generally yes, but for certain high-end zones the ONLY safe spots to 
med are the zone lines.  Where are you going to sit, med, buff, form 
groups, etc in WW other than the SG or ToV zone line?  How about in SG for 
that matter?  How about in Skyfire?  In those zones mobs don't path to the 
zone lines unless pulled.  You have to have someplace to set up and get 
ready, and the zone lines are the safest places.

Well, in some cases it is by far the safest spot in the zone.  I have 
noticed that quite a few high-end dungeons have mobs either spawning or 
pathing right by the zone out though.  I suspect this is to convince 
people to stay off the tracks.  (I'm thinking specifically of seb and 
chardok here.)  Still, there are zones where the zone line is the only 
place to safely med.

Well, that's actually about the best thing you can do.  Zone out as quicly 
as possible, hope you zone out before the mobs get close enough to aggro 
the people waiting.  You shouted, people were warned.

Exactly, or at least stand up and be ready to zone if you see the train 
caller come charging past.  In most cases it's pretty obvious which zone 
someone is training to.  If you're in Lower Guk and you here TRAIN, you 
can assume it's coming to the dead side/upper guk line.  If you're in King 
room, 99% of the time you can safely ignore it.  If you're in SolB you can 
pretty much trust that any train call is going to refer to the zone to 
Lavastorm.  In most zones where there are several logical possibilites, 
it's almost always /shout Train to <foozone>.
