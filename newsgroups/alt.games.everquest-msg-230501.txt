SOB!!!  (That's as in mournful weeping and pathos, not as in S.O.B., by
the way.  Consider it a sort of advance warning of the story that is to
come, oh yes.) 

Actually, I'd LOVE to have a high-level character that I didn't know how
to play, 'cos I been playing for YEARS (lit) and have never got into the
20's level-wise.  This is because a) I'm a crap player, b) I'm not very
gregra.. gerga.. greeg... sociable for grouping, and c) I'm a crap
player (I know, but it's worth mentioning twice).  And d'you know, I
don't want much.  I don't want to run around being 'l33t' (or whatever
it is you kids are sayin these days).  I don't wanna be the bestest Dark
Elf in the whole place...  D'you know what I want most?  Just to see the
scenery, run around, explore the place. 

'Course, as things stand I walk into Everfrost and FU... sorry, I mean,
DARNED Lars what's-his-kilt stamps on my throat...  Walk into the
Faydark and them pompous geeks in the trees giggle and turn me into a
porcupine with unique round-fletching'd spines...  The less said about
High Elves the better...  And Erudites?  Well, they're just rude. 
Fatally dangerous AND rude - which let me tell ya is not a good combo
there.  And what's left?  Hang out with DARK ELVES?  Pah (do people
actually say that?).  Not likely.  They're definitely the worst of the
lot.  And it would be so nice to be vastly high level so that Lars Beard
Boy could kiss my little blue butt for once (figuratively speaking -
there's the beard to consider, after all...  Urgh...), and the smug
Indigo toe-rags in Neriak could taste a bit of my cold steel, aha... 
Ahem. 

Just thought I'd mention it.  :o)

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
