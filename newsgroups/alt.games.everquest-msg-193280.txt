Dont really know any important uses for it. Know some books cant be read 
without the right laguage (gnoll scrolls in Splitpaw for instance, or 
the tailoring book for wood elves). Heard rumors of a few quest that 
needed dragon or elder dragon, but never seen them.
4K i would say is completely ridiculous for a language of any kind. 
EVERYONE can master every langage quite fast, just you and a friend go 
sit at a zone line, or have a succor person. 1 of you just need 1 point 
in the language, and youll be able to train the other person to 1 point 
higher. So you got 1 point, and train your friend to 2. Then you succor 
or zone (MIGHT be changed now, when you can see language skillup without 
zoning, but not sure), and he now have 2. HE can now train you to 3, 
succor/zone and repeat till you both got 100 skill.

That way any 2boxer can learn it fast. Personally i just got interested 
when i met a gnome that worked on languages and learned me a few for 
getting FierDal, then traded a few more with different people, and at 
last ended up having mastering all 25. Never had a real use for them, 
apart from roleplay purposes, or the occasional fun of hearing 2 persons 
talk in their language about me, and then answering back in the same 
langage :)
