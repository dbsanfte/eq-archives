The quesion is not Coldain vs. Cov. It's Coldain vs. Kromriff/zec. (The
giants.) Whether you go on giant or dorf faction doesn't really matter
to you. Killing *either* of them will get you faction with the Dragons,
which you want. You will want to be at least dubious to CoV, if not
better, later on. Why? You have ports that go into WL and CS. Both of
these can be death traps for a porter who is KOS to the dragons. Also,
CS in particular is a favored hunting spot of many wizzies post fifty.
Without faction, you can forget it as a viable option. CS is also the
gateway to get to SG, WW, and DN which are wonderful places for you
later on in life. May as well get the faction. It's not that hard to do.

Back to Dorf vs. Giant... there are quests for armor no matter which way
you go, but if you get in good with the dorfs (and are suicidally insane
when it comes to tradeskills) you can start on the coldain prayer shawl
quests. Pretty good deal for a wizzie. I'm almost done with Shawl 3
which gives a nice pair of rewards.
