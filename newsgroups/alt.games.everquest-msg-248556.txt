Yes, 255 until levels 61+, then 5 higher per level and AA's to hit 355

Get a higher level druid to cast Protection of the Nine on you.  Morten was
correct as well, Spiritual Dominion is the Beastlord buff that you want.

Focus items are extremely necessary, even at the cost of hp or wis.  For a
druid, I would recommend:

-Improved Damage
-Affliction Efficiency
-Burning Affliction
-Mana Preservation

Those 4 for soloing, whether quadding or dotting.

For grouping:
-Improved Healing
-Extended Enhancement
-Improved Damage
-Mana Preservation

Spell haste also helps, but not completely necessary.  You can get the Level
3 focus effects at decent prices, and they are good until level 60.  Past
that, you'll need the level 4, and they can get pricey.  Check out the
pottery items (Ceramic Incense Burner of Ro, etc...).  Tribute is also great
if you can get some cheap items. Try a Facemask of Frozen Mana for
tribute... they are very common and under 2k on my server - and give 13-15k
tribute points if I remember correctly.

You can do the Earring of the Solstice quest twice.  Should cost 5k or so
each.

What you do is buy 9 items, and combine them in a forge (no fail).  For that
combine, you get 2 things, the druid spell 'Protection of the Cabbage's and
'Xanthe's Earring of Nature'

Xanthe's Earring of Nature
LORE ITEM NO DROP
Weight: 0.1 Size: TINY
Slot: EAR
AC: +5 Str: +8 Sta: +8 Wis: +10 Fire Resist: +7 Cold Resist: +7 Magic
Resist: +7 HP: +55 Mana: +55
Classes: Druid
Races: All Races
Slot 1: Type 7
Effect: Circle of the Combines

Type: Triggered
Charges: Unlimited
Level for Effect: 44

Protection of the Cabbage
Classes:
Druid Level 59

-Increase AC by 24
-Increase max HP by 567 (L59) to 485 (L65)
-Increase HP when cast by 467-485
-Increase mana by 6 per tick

Here are the items you need to combine:

Ceremonial Solstice Robe
Demi-Sec Champagne
Blessed Fishing Rod
Golden Idol of Tunare
Lotus Pie
Lucky Cabbage
Mistletoe Cutting Sickle
Misty Thicket Picnic
Star Ruby Encrusted Stein

To get both earrings, you'll need to turn in the first Xanthe's earring you
get to a Druid NPC in fungus grove.  Easy to get to, zoning in from echo,
she's in a building on the left, before you get to any mobs.  Her name is
Rebecca Cabbageleaf - hand her your Xanthe's earring to get an Earring of
the Solstice.

Then go combine your 9 items in a forge again, destroy the second copy of
Protection of the Cabbage, and equip your Xanthe's earring as well!
