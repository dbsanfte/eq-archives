A Fungi is NOT a dupe, an exploit, etc...  Those that have a Fungi -usually-
EARNED that right.  Go get yourself a Fungi the good ole fashioned way as I
have, THEN, tell me that you havent EARNED the right to allow your twinks a
faster passage through the irrelevant and tedious levels.

All in all... dont fuckin inspect people then you'll never truly know that
they are wearing a fungi... which brings me to another issue..

I believe those that inspect me cheapens my gaming experience... oh wait,
people will bitch and say its a game feature.. well guess what?  A Fungi is
a LEGIT item/game feature as well.  Hmmmm...
