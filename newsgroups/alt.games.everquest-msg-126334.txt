I play on Fennin Ro. I only have one character, a level 13 bard at the
moment, but I used to have a 30 Wzard (deleted him in a fit of anger a few
months back).  A friend of mine has a 57 Cleric in the Guild "Blood of
Honor". In this guild, there is another 57 cleric who, earlier today, was
going to camp Ragefire for the last part of his epic. He got up at 6 AM,
assembled a large raiding party, and went to wait for Ragefire to Spawn.

At this point, I just want to point out that this is second hand
information, as I am no where near high enough to have been part of this,
nor am I a member of this guild. My info comes from my friends in BoH.

Anyways, so Blood of Honor is there camping Ragefire.  Another guild, I
think it's called Aegis and then some other words (don't remember exactly),
shows up to camp. No problem, they can do that. However, the first guild to
engage the mob has the rights to it. So, at 2:50 PM Ragefire spawns. Both
guilds rush to get the first hit, and logs show that BoH's melees got the
first hit. However, Aegis, which is a bigger guild and had more members
present at this camp, rushes in and gets the kill. Their Cleric, Raandy,
gets the heart. Every member of BoH petitioned, and an admin GM shows up. He
says to them "I have nothing to say to any of you. Raandy, congrats on your
epic"

Now this is just fucked up. So anyways, the cleric who was there for his
epic from BoH talks to teh GM in tells. I apologize for not having logs of
this myself, but I can assure you it is true, I wouldn't make it up.

Anyways, this cleric talks to the GM. He says that he has logs proving that
BoH melees got first engagement, and that theyrightfully should have the
piece. By this time, the other guild had left the zone.  The GM tells him
that logs mean nothing.  This cleric then asks to speak to a supervisor.
The GM issues a warning on his account, and on the accounts of all present
members of BoH for harassment and zone disruption (of which it was neither).
He said that if the cleric *ever* petitioned again about Ragefire, he would
be suspended for 10 days.

Now, this is SICKENING to me. The cleric has written an email to Verant, but
who knows where that will go? I mean, this poor sod as been waiting for it,
gets KSed, and then the GM (who is employed by Verant to correct such
things) flaunts his authority by issuing them warnings. IMHO, he should be
fired. Thats a ridiculous abuse in my eyes and in the eyes of the entire BoH
guild.

Any opinions? Please, don't post a reply that says something like "Well that
would suck if it were true" or something like that. I didn't make this up.
If you want to believe that I did, thats fine, but don't contaminate the
thread with that. Please.

Anyways, what do you guys think?
