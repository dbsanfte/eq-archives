Subject: Entry to Stonebrunt bugged?

Elcarin, my druid, made the trek to see the sights in the Stonebrunt Mtns. 
Unfortunately I crashed to desktop after zoning in.  Whenever I try to log
Elcarin in I hear cats squalling as if in a fight (not a good sign) and crash
to desktop again.

Is this a common problem?  I don't seem to have problems like this anywhere
else.


-Well, God was my co-pilot....but we crashed into a mountain and I had to eat
Him.
