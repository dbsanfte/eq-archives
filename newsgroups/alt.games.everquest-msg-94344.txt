Finished reading this post at Steel Warriors on the subject.

Apparently, according to one of the Warlords on Stormhammer, the
revamped Cazic Thule has already been live on Legends for a while. So,
it may be coming our way today.

Also, if you read this thread, you'll see that they report that an
uberguild exploration party got totaled in the Courtyard. Never got near
the bottom. Mobs are in the fifties, unmezzable, cast slows on everyone,
with some new named in there. Speculation is that the Avatar of Fear has
probably been buffed up to match his cousin in Kael. (AoW) but not
confirmed yet.

The "old Cazic" mobs have been moved outside the zone onto the island,
so the lower level players should still be able to get their Ravenscale
and such.  I've contacted my guild. We're launcing an exploration party
in there tongight of our top guns. Probably suicide, but I'll report
back what we find here.
