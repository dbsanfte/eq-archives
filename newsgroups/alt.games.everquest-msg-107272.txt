Jeez guys: Heres the deal -

/q'ing & LD - This set you into a LD state, so anything that can happen
while LD will happen.
    - If you are fighting a mob and /q you continue to fight the mob until
one of you dies.
    - If you are idle for 30 seconds you dissapear
    - You can still get an agro while LD if an unfriendly mob see's you and
this will reset your counter.
    - You can exp while LD (I actually went LD during a battle and won and
leveled wahoo)
    - If you are Feigned you stay Feigned and safely dissapear. Common
technique for clearing agro, just make sure you dont feign at the mobs spawn
location.

Camping - Obviously you need to sit to camp and it takes 30 seconds
    - If you are in battle and try to sit and camp, sitting raises your
agro, so make sure the mob is rooted or the tank definately has agro
    - Common technique in PoF is to rush the zone in with 1 or 2 groups run
to a wall that is a safe spot, we do the left wall, some do straight ahead.
Then let the tanks fight to the death while a cleric camps and a monk
Feignes. Monks then /q to clear agro, then pull corpses to cleric who can
safelt rez once logged back in. Once that is complete the zonein can be
cleared much easier

SAVES - This is important, have you ever been in a zone when the zone
crashes, or even worse when the server crashes. If you have been then you
know when you log back in you appear at the last saved spot. Saves occur on
a timed interval, not after you get somethign good. So yes you loose
everything back to the saved point. Thats why it saves a frequently. Its
kinda like why you save you Word Document every few minutes, so incase your
pc crashes, which if your suing windows, it will, you dont loose everything.
