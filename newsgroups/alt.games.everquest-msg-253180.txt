You miss the point obviously.  It's not a one way street.  All my
friends can count on me for just about anything, as I can count on
them.

If you've never had to endure hardships with someone then I don't
think there's much of a bond to hold you together.  It's easy to say
your friends but when it comes time to pony up, would you make
sacrifices for that person that you've never even met?  Personally I
would not, maybe others would.
