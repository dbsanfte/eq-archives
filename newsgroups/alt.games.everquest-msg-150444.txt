I don't mean FT 15 on the epic.  I mean even FT 1.  Or MPIII.  Either
way.

Is there a wizard item with an insta cast/recast 800dd nuke?  If not,
I don't see how this is following the same logic.  How about if the
wizard epic had FT 1 or MPIII on it?  THAT would certainly be
comperable.

In fact, how about if every epic had FT1 or MPIII or Regen on it?
FT and a regen that stacks with all other regen would be best, since
they wouldn't take away from any other gear out there, but you'd
start seeing more people wanting to keep the things equipped.

It breaks my heart it does.  Luckily there are better summoned hammers
out there that are drop only spells, so it gives me something to work
towards for a while.  But really, I only need one drop, and its going to
be the same drop every other 60 battlecleric has.  I used to get comments
about Righteousness or Adjele's Ceremonial Cudgel, not mindbendingly
good items, but nothing seen on every street corner, fun to have a different
look and effect.  Now I have a "ho hum, just like everyone else" weapon
in my hand.  Even the upgrade weapons apparantly have the same stats,
same look, same proc... only difference will, it seems, be the name if
someone inspects, and the proc rate.

I certainly don't say it makes or breaks raids.  Or even significantly
contributes to them.  Now you are looking at five or six real damage
dealer melees, as many real damage dealer nukers for the "kill this
faster" mobs, no single regular melee damage dealer is going to make
much difference.

On the other hand, in a full group consisting of say

warrior
chanter
cleric
shaman
rogue
wizard

Having the chanter, cleric, and shaman all fight adds about a quarter
more dps compared to having them all sit on their butts.  (assuming the
chanter has summoned pet, if he has a dire charm pet, significantly
more)

How about in a small group?

Paladin
Bard
Cleric
Druid

is one I'm in with some frequency.  Not optimal by any means, but
its all friends, and it does get the job done.  Now, though, that
battlecleric is capable of handing in about a fifth the damage output
of the group, what with bard haste and bard dex boosting, more than
this on the little mobs the druid doesn't bother DOTing (she's our puller,
often brings mobs in, drops them off rooted, and runs out to get more),
less than this on big mobs where the druid gets serious.
