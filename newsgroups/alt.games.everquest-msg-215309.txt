Is this what they're doing then? I'm a UK player, on VS, but I'm
an SOE customer. I don't know what other distribution deals are
going to go on, but I'm planning on getting EQ2 the moment it's
humanly possible, by mail-order from Sony or whatever. My
experience with European distributions has been that if Company
A makes and sells a game, and Company B distributes it in other
territories, then there's no point inn buying it from Company B
because all you're doing is putting a middle-man in between you
and the people who make the game. I'm altogether glad I stayed
a SOE customer... now I get the option to be on Legends, use
the AAA pass, and so on.

Quite apart from that, as a fan of the game, there's no way a 4 month
delay would be acceptible. Expect me to log on to a server as a level
1 toon with the entire population already 50+? Expect me to start playing
a game where every secret, every drop, every quest is dissected in
detail on 1000 message boards before I even see it? No thanks.
