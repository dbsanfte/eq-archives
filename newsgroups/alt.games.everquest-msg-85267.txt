RUNNYEYE !

Seriously, I love that place. My alt warrior has gotten from 23 to 25 now
there and I wish I went there earlier.

Trust me, the battles are epic. Charmers, nukers, sudden adds, decent to
good loot, several levels on which you can play when progressing through the
levels, etc.

Halflings got it all made for them :)
