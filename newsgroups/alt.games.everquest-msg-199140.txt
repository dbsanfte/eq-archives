Planetfall... wow - theres an old game. Back in the days where your
brain determined the resolution of the graphics, and load times were
excrutiating (sp?). I find it humorous when people complain about how
long it takes to zone or load up the game when I recall hitting play
on that damn tape recorder, wandering off, and coming back after 25-30
mins to see if my trash-80 successfully loaded the game, and then
starting the whole damn process over because if barfed on one byte out
of the *huge* 16k program.
