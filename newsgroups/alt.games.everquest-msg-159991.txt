I did this quest with my Enchanter and Warrior and ended up having to go to
EC to get the brain.  It is no-drop.  It drops off of the giant fire
beetles.  When I did the armor quest with the Warrior, the arm piece was
bugged, so I never got them.  If you have seen people with full sets,
perhaps the bug has been fixed.  Good Luck.
