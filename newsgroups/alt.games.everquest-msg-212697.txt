Y'know, it seems to me that what you are calling "facts" are actually what
a scientist would call "data".  In my four years of studying biology, we
talked about data, hypotheses, and theories.  The word "facts" was more a
layman's term that came out when you were being sloppy.

You are correct, nothing in the data rules out intervention by a third
party.  However, the possibility of intervention is a statistically very
very tiny one.  That's all.  If you want to know why it is statistically
very small, get ready to read a LOT of literature. :P

You talk about "science" as if it were some mystical cult, sheesh (maybe
for some it is).  Call it "logical reason for the observations", please,
because science is simply a way of asking questions and trying to answer
them.  If there is any faith involved, it is faith in logic and in our own
5 senses.
