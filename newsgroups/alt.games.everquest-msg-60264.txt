I think that's a little faulty on the wording. These tactics are
designed to produce conditions of victory through any means possible. 
Still for now we will go with (a) being true. 



>b) one-sided confrontations are
>not interesting by their very nature, 

If your talking absolutely one sided yes. If your talking about one
sided where there is a possibility of success via tactics that's not
true at all. And the sort of one sided confrontations that are
absolute are so rare in any non newbie wargame as to be considered
flukes. if you go into the game accepting that you are going to get
owned until you learn the ropes it helps. 

Take my first Star Trek Armada game online yesterday. I knew I was
hosed because I made a game called Newbie wants to learn. Hehe.
I started off the way the single player game had said to start off.
The enemy instead rushed forward and built canons closing me into one
small corner of the map.  Next game he did a variation of that
strategy based on using chokepoints in floating alleys because I
patrolled my own area up front and didn't allow such cannon placement.
Yes i got utterly owned the first two games but i learned and adapted
and eventually ther will come a day when that won't happen except by
user error (ie I pull a DOH!).  I'm man enough to take a mistake on my
part in stride and come back for more. 

The problem here is that your assuming all tactics described in (a)
lead to extreme one sided confrontations when in non learning
situations it is much rarer. 

>c) the primary purpose of a game is to

True enough.


>d) uninteresting situations are not entertaining, thus

True enough. 

> e) games that reward RL tactics are poorly designed.

Only if RL tactics produce uninteresting situations which you have
stated as a given but not proved. In (a) you state the tactics are
Intended to produce these results. True. The same tactics however and
their countertactics intend to produce that the situation will never
occur. You are somehow assuming that only one side will use tactics.
if both sides do and both are relatively equal in terms of
newbieness/experience then such overwhelming strategic flanking and
superiority will not occur that often.

Daoc has level caps, rules (game mechanics) on taking and holding
keeps, weight classes (some areas are pvp some not, if your not ready
to rumble stay home), etc. And frankly Honor and sportmanship don't
belong in War. Never have never will.

I'm assuming Shadowfist is a card game where stacked decks don't
occur? And with semi strict rules?

Dennis I think your limiting yourself. Grab a copy of The Operational
Art of War, by norm kroger (it should be cheaper then ten bucks now)
and play a more open ended war game. Grab a copy of TFC or Tribes (TFC
preferred, or perhaps counterstrike although its not as newbie
friendly) and see what team based combat against real people can be
like. Do it as an experiment. Give it one week.  Considering that the
most it would cost is 20 bucks or so and weeks worth of gaming time
and the potential exists to open whole new gaming vistas to you, isn't
that a fair risk? If you try it and don't like it then forever more
you can always say, hey I tried it and hated it. 

I used to dislike FPS games with a passion too until I discovered TFC
and other team based games. I bought one on a lark because I had a new
pc that could finally run them and wanted to see what all the fuss was
about. Deathmatch bores me silly.  I will remember certain TFC games
for years. like the time I came into a game with the score 10 to 190,
and single handedly stopped the enemies flag rushes and turned the
team around. We still lost 140 to 190, but they never capped again.
And had the game gone on another twenty minutes we would have won.  I
got 7 invitations to join TFC clans that game alone. It was glorious.
