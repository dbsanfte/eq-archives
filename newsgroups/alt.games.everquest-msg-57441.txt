A friend of mine plays a barbarian warrior.  She is looking for some
fairly cheap weapon upgrades.  She is currently dual wielding
Langseaxes.  She did get a mith 2 hander recently for 450pp, so her 2hs
is good for a bit.  What do you recommend as upgrades to the langs,
probably in the under 1k category.  I did the wakizashi of the frozen
skies quest for her, but haven't had a chance to pass that on yet. 

She is currently level 27 almost 28.  TIA
