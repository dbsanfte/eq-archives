What about characters on the four servers that have the same names? How will 
they be handling that? I THINK I have some characters on one or two of the 
zek servers (haven't done PvP in EQ in quite some time), and they may even 
have the same names if indeed they are on more than 1 of the 
servers...hmm...and this went into effect already? I may have to check it 
out to see what happened. *grin*
