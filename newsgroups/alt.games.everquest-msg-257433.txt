Nice idea

Again, I'm sooo excited (checks to make sure skies are still turned off

Interesting, but lets take a look

It used to be fairly friendly, but then they broke it, I haven't been 
able to get it working in windows for ages; the mouse locks up.

Good to see they are spending lots of time on PvP instead of something 
that affects the other 98% of the players.  Similar idea to spending 
most of their time on concerns of the 2% of players in Time+ raiding guilds.

But since the mouse will still lock up, you won't be able to actually 
use the computer for anything -or- play EQ, no matter what the frame 
rate is.  Enjoy!

Only zones on this list I ever spent any real time in are COM and Chardok.

Hmm, doesn't chardok screw a faction that people need to get a couple 
hot quest items?  Seems to me thats a terrible idea.

On the other hand, Chardok was also one of the really workable PBAoE 
group zones; imagine killing 70 mobs at a time but now with a HOT ZONE 
bonus!

OK, now this just seems annoying.  I mean, whats the point?  Advantage 
to small race characters in PvP?

All in all, the least interesting patch I've seen in quite some time, 
and the most interesting part is, to me, a bit of a dissapointment, 
because there seem to be fewer HOT ZONE spots to try in any given level 
range.... and because one of the couple in my target range happens to be 
Chardok, which I've done dozens of levels in over several characters. 
GE will be interesting though, finally should be able to get a group in 
there!
