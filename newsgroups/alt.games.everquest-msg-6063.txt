> 1. At what level does a Shaman really start to shine?

Depending on your definition of shining. I started enjoying my shaman at level 9 when he got SoW and infravision.
Most people say that shamans come into power around level 34. At 39 they 
get their best and definitive spell

Nukes are useless just about for anyone, especially for a shaman. There 
are very few exceptions

> 2. What are the class advantages of the Shaman?

1) Best debuffs in the game, making a well played shaman into an 
outstanding healer. It can be argued that until level 50 shamans heal 
much more efficiently than clerics (if there's no shaman in the group)
2) Decent heals
3) Very good armor class (if you choose so)
4) Very good DoTs, if you are soloing
5) Outstanding overall combat utility spells (second best haste, second 
best regeneration, second best heals)

1-60. Well, haven't tried at 60, so that I only know from people that 
claim to have done it. I tried soloing between 1 and 51 and it worked 
fine (though boring)

> 4. What strategies best suit the Shaman class?

Depending on level, of course, but the two generally used are root-
kiting and DoT-tanking. In the first one you DoT a monster, root it and 
sit until either wears off, then refresh it. In the second you find best 
AC you can find, best weapon you can find, slow and DoT the monster and 
tank it together with your pet

Barb shaman would not be my choice second time around (it was the first 
time). I would go with iksar or ogre second time, they have their 
advantages if you are into min-maxing. But if you chose your shaman's 
race from roleplaying perspective, it sounds like you would enjoy that 
more, more power to you!
