I still have to ask, why more then one installation?  I have 2 very large
HD's I also have, well lets just say more the 1 account(s).  All I need to
play with any one account is one installation on this system.  Each
installation with  Luclin is 1.5gig+  and more I'm sure with PoP.  Why would
you waist the HD space with more then on install?
