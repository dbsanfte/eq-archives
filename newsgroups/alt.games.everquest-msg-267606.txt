Everquest 2 is the sequel to Everquest.  They are two games within the same
series.

*Everquest* 2.  As opposed to Eternal Quest.  Or Legend of Sony.  Or any other
title which would be completely unrelated.

And you know this from your vast EQ2 playing experience, I take it.

I find several things in common with the two games.

Because one group discussing both games with a moderate amount of traffic has
a much better shot of mantaining a viable community than two sparsely
trafficed groups, one with possible propgation issues.  (Yes, I know, you
dont' care as long as it's not your group.  Too bad, I do care.)

No, we're getting swamped by your posts bitching about EQ2 posts, which is not
quite the same thing.

Aside from that... well, I was here first.   I see no reason to leave the
newsgroup just because you threw a hissy fit.
