I currently have a Lammy for my primary weapon, and I'm thinking about 
upgrading my secondary weapon (currently using a Cane of the 
Tranquil)...which would be a better choice - a second Lammy or a CSS? 
Would putting a Lammy in the offhand make its low delay worthless, in 
which case I should go with the higher damage CSS?

I've been trying to decide all night, and your opinions would be greatly 
appreciated
