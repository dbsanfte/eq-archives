Both of my EQ computers started getting freeze-ups (1-60 seconds
apiece) after I installed drivers for my new Epson printer.

After I nuked the printer monitor software (e_****) from my
Task Manager before running Everquest, things went back to
running just fine again.

Even if you don't have an Epson printer, some other
piece of software could be interfering with Everquest,
including virus checkers.

Try this:  Go to your Task Manager (ctrl-alt-del), and nuke
EVERYTHING that isn't "Explorer".  (If you run dial-up, do
this *before* you dial up, or else you'll end up nuking
your dial-up connection too.)  Then run Everquest.

If suddenly everything is happy again, then reboot, nuke
only some of the software, and try EQ again.  In this way
you'll be able to quickly narrow down which software is
the culprit.

Note:  If you're running on Windows 2000 or some variant,
you may have to browse through the "process" tab as well,
but be careful what you kill there, you can crash your
system.  But if you see something that is obviously add-on
software and not a core piece of the operating system, kill
it too, at least during the tests I describe above.
