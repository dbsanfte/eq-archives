Last time I did it, that's what I did.  I paid a lowbie in the newbie fields
10 pp to group with me while he continued to solo in the same zone.  His job
was to spam group-chat with the language and he got paid 5pp at 50, 5pp at
100.  All in all, I thought it was a very easy way for him to make
money...and so did he.

The hard part is teaching a newbie how to make a social for that purpose.
Every time I've tried to learn a language, it's taken me 10 minutes for them
to understand the task and prepare for it.  /sigh
