Guess what? This isn't real life! Making a truly realistic tradeskill
system not only would be far more work than its worth, but would be
phenomenally boring to the players. You thought they were bad now?
Imagine having to spend years learning the bare basics of a skill for
hours a day...

The "ingredients destroyed" aspect of a failure means that the
resulting product was flawed beyond marketability. You can't un-make a
flawed leather padding to get your ingredients back so you can try
again. The raw materials are destroyed in a sense in the creation
process, whether it's successful or not.

Another point brought up above: Failure doesn't mean that you were
unable to make the product. It means the product was sub-standard.
Tradeskills are designed around player economy (that was the intent.
Unfortunately, it doesn't work out as intended). The game forces
product standards in its world, so a sub-standard product can't be
introduced into the market. If the product isn't up to standards, it's
considered a failure by the game.

I'd say that the materials themselves can also be assumed to
contribute to a failed combine. A flaw in the pelt, an impurity in the
metal, etc.
