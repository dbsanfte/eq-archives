Would you like to download and install Gator and Offer Companion? It 
makes your life better. This download has a digital certificate...

Sooner or later someone is going to click ok... even if just to make the 
damn thing stop popping up. :(

Kids/Teens/Adults get tired of seeing the popup. They get sucked in by 
the offer of 200 new smileys for their MSN chat... or a free desktop 
background of their favourite band... or the 'bundled game' that lets 
them throw darts at a certain presidents clueless mug...

Relying on the interactive user to say no everytime a popup pops up is 
not a valid security policy. Its a disaster waiting to happen. ...sorta 
makes me think of the simpsons episode where he's got that toy that 
presses 'Y' for him every few seconds to control the nuclear power plant :)

Accidents *will* happen.

Its a common affliction. Far too many companies take what uncle Bill 
spoon feeds them no questions asked. At least Outlook is better than 
Outlook Express.
