No, you're not too late by any means.  My 55 Paladin decided to take
up Piercing at L53.  First, I suggest you dump any spare practice
points into the skill at an NPC trainer.  Then try to locate some
cheap DEX gear that doesn't hurt your AC/HP too much (DEX affects
weapon skill-ups).  Now either group with friends/guildmates who
know what you're doing and don't mind, or go out solo and find a
group that doesn't mind you beating on their mobs (you aren't gonna
outdamage a group, so you won't be KSing).  You'll get your best
results from dark-blue cons.  You have to hit to have a chance of a
skill-up, so even though you get a better chance of a skill-up on any
particular hit against a tougher mob, you want to fight low blues
(not light blues) while your skill is low.  Don't forget to use two
weapons (you did train Dual Wield at L13, didn't you?).
