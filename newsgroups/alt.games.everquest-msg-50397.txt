I let my casting decide for me in the end.  I started out wanting Evocation,
as I have done a fair amount of soloing, so I put 20 training points in
that, and one in each of the others.  I then played, soloing and grouping,
and Alteration became my specialization.  The sad thing is that the spell
that really pushed it up was Cannibalize, which, AFAIK, does not benefit
from specialization.  Oh well, I spend a lot of time as
healer/buffer/debuffer anyway.
