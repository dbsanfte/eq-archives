I have a ton of stuff that I bought, won, was given, etc for different toons 
that are no more.  If I go to an NPC even with cha over 150 I am offered 
very little for it.
I know I need to make a trader in the Bazaar, but not sure of some things 
there.
Do I need food and water on my trader when selling?
Do I have to buy and keep on me multiple trader packs or can they sit in my 
bank?
I was told I could use my Bard and make him play an instriment before I go 
into trader-mode and I would get skill-ups, is this true?
Any other tips would be handy.

Thanks for the help ... Ben
