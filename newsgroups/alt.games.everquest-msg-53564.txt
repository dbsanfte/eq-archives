Only one character to buff and heal, he also needs to hold aggro totally. I
was not thinking of half group, I was thinking full but only one tank. Yes,
I have been there (OK so I had Necro and Mage pet to help) as it goes we did
not have an enchanter and I rcv'd quickness Shamen but had we had an
Enchanter I'd have wanted Alacrity.
(Mage, Necro, 2 x Shaman, Druid and Warrior...Playing off peak (US) times
can result in some "interesting" groups, not complaining, it worked)
