Thanks for the input so far.  Before asking this question on here, I had
told my bf that I would drop the guild if I were him, but he's reluctant to
drop because we're on a new server and all his friends from his old server
that switched over are in this one.  Peer pressure?!  I've told him to
explain the situation (wanting to complete epic, and where they are going
will screw his faction bad) and remove himself until he completes the epic,
or the portion that he is concerned about, then rejoin.  It seems alot of
the problem is that the guild leaders are on major power trips, and have
told him he doesn't need the crappy epic, blah blah blah.

My plans are to stay out of a guild until I feel I need to be in one, which
I don't at this point.  I will not be told by anyone that my goals in this
game are stupid or a waste of time, it's my time and I'll use or waste it as
I see fit.  Sorry, didn't mean to sound snotty there... just my thoughts on
the matter.
