I'll take pity.  :)  My bard is only 52, though, so YMMV.

Bards are indeed not ideal tanks.  Playing alongside a warrior and a paladin
at various times, I take FAR more damage than they do, despite being in
better armor and five levels higher.

Slow and Snare are massive taunts, as you would well know as a ranger.  All
bard songs but one (Amplification) last for four pulses, allowing you to
twist three without interruption.  If you get a fizzle or interrupt on
slowsong or snaresong (most bard snaresongs have a slow component) you can
try to restart; depending on how many songs you're twisting at once you may
or may not have restart time.

Ever see those commercials for a chemical company called BSF?  Their motto
is "We don't make the products you buy.  We make the products you buy
better."  I can't think of a better motto for a bard.
