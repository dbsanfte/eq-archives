He's from a PvP (Zek, Red, Pk, etc...) server.

I used the (from what I understand) favorite term of the Zek players for a
non-PvP server (carebear, also blue server,  I've heard non -pvp servers
also refered to as Rainbowland and Chutes and Ladders servers...) to allow
him instant comprehension.

This was not meant as derogatory towards non-pvp servers, as I myself play
on one, feeling that the frustration of dealing with EQ's pvp system (In
which the winner of the battle is generally decided in the first 1/2 second
of the fight) is not worth my time.

If it was taken this way,  I apologize.

On Vallon, Tallon and Rallos Zek servers you do not lose exp when dying from
lava, drowning, or falling (the environment), because it made it too easy
for people to kill others with root/charm/fear for xp loss (pvp deaths
generally incure no xp loss).
I'm uncertain as to the rules on Sullon Zek, as you actually lose XP when
dying due to PvP, so they may also lose xp vs. the environment as well.
