Dude, I played my shaman, and grouped with a 51 shaman.  He was handling 
slowing the mobs, I was the healer, and at times tossed out a slow when he 
had trouble getting it to stick.  I am well aware of what spells a 51 
shaman has.  You might have missed the bit where I said "in a group" 
implying there may have been a few others there with us, like, say, a tank 
for instance, a wizard, a rogue, and a ranger.

No, less than 10 seconds.  If you are going to troll, at least learn to 
read and comprehend what you read.


Ah well, enough playing with the trolls.
