The thread was of course closed.  A separate thread was started up. 
Nothing definitive was derived from this thread, either.

Call me dense, but the argument that Morsereg=Sanornik just didn't
make sense to me until I read a post in that separate thread.  So for
those that are as dense as I am, here is how it clicked for me:

[quote]
Actually I think one of the biggest pieces of evidence that Morsereg =
Sanornik is that from the start of the deal, Morsereg (as Dadani)
tells Sukliz that it will be Sanornik's roomate logging on.

"a girl called Dadani, saying her RL friend was selling one. I asked
how much he wanted, and she said bout 50k. I offered 55k. She said she
was gonna call him and ask if that was cool. He said sure. I was told
that his roomate was gonna log his char on for him, cuz he was at
work... "

At this point since Morsereg is claiming to have no knowledge that
Sukliz was about to be scammed, why would he feel the need to create
some fictional roomate? We see here that Morsereg is already coming up
with lies before he even has anything to cover up for.

This from "Velorath" on 9/17/02 1:57:24 am.

From the initial thread, we are told from Morsereg himself that
Sanornik is a girl named "Melissa" and is the ultimate source of evil
here.  Yet here he says it is a guy (whom he called) that was not
there, so the transaction was handled by his roommate.  If he had no
ill intention to scam the person (as Morsereg ultimately claims beyond
page 8), why would he need to make up this story?

Very interesting thread.
