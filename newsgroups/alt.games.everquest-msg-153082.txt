Hi,

I've tried the eq techie boards with no response as yet so gonna try my luck
here too :)

Recenlty upgraded my graphic card to a Geforce2 MX400. Deleted the old
drivers for old card in add/new hardware. Then updtated the new card driver
to the one recommened in the tech support section of the EQ site (30.82)

When I play the game little blue squares pop up in my windows (chat box,
buff box etc new UI) sometimes later I will then get lines all in different
areas of the screen and finally the whole screen will just continuosly
scramble making it totally unplayable.

Any help greatly appreciated :) any yes I don't understand computers ;)

Cheers

Kev
