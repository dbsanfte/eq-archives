I'm in the process of making up a Christmas list, as demanded by
relatives each year. They generally like to have one big ticket item,
and my GeForce2 GTS is getting a bit long in the tooth, so I figured a
new video card might be spiffy.

I'm fond of NVidia, and a friend of mine has had a lot of trouble with
his Radeon in EQ, so I'm sticking with the NVidia line.

Unfortunately, it's remarkably hard to draw comparisons between the
various models, because NVidia tends to focus on just one of each
class. For example, I'm considering a FX5700 Ultra and a FX5900
(non-ultra), both of which can be had in 128MB models for around $225.
But the NVidia site doesn't give any specs for the FX5900, and instead
focuses only on the FX5950 Ultra - which at around $500 is a bit
bigger of a ticket than I care to worry about.

So, what are the practical differences, especially to someone who
plays mostly just EQ with occasional forays into Warcraft III, NWN and
SC3K? It seems as though the FX5900 should be the better card, but I
can't come up with decent real number comparing it with the FX5700.

I've read reviews at TomsHardware and Anandtech, but these cards are
never compared directly to one another.

Anyone have any helpful suggestions or information?
