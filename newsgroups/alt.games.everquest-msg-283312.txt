I tried a few things and eventually tracked this down, sort of.
The problem was that her UI file, in the [GroupWindow] section,
specified Petbars=false.  But that leads to the question of how
that setting got there.  Neither of us edited the file to do it,
and frankly I can't find any mention of such a feature in game.
I couldn't find anything in the Options window (including all
the Keys choices), or any likely command (documented or not).

Has anyone heard of a UI for controlling this display?

Hm, I see that the PlayerWindow has the same setting; I should
check that she has it turned on for when she gets a summoned
hammer pet...
