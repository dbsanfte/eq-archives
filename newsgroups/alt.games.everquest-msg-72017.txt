Hey, Bro, I'm going to assume from the emoticon that you're kidding, but
I was serious about my question. If I just thought it was a typo, I
woulnd't seriously bust your balls about it. But it's not just you and
not just a few people. I see a LOT of them, even in our guild, and
random folks we meet when out grouping, using "Argo". I was just
wondering if that had become part of the EQ lexicon. There's already a
ton of words in common use in EQ that never existed IRL, or being used
in totally different ways than their conventional meanings, so I see no
reason for this one not to be added if it's the common usage.
