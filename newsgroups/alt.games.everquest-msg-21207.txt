An acquantance reports his mule going LD in EC tunnel, getting
back in under a minute, to find all packs on him gone. Not the
gear, just the packs.  Discounting his claim of 200kpp value,
as he tends to ask for outlandish sums, I find 100kpp believable,
as he is a serious farmer of a 55 mage, as well as a high level
Velious tailor, and since he asks for high figures, his mule is
often more loaded with goods than might someone who is
shall we say a "motivated seller" like me (want my sale in
under 10 minutes even if I only get half what the item is "worth")

Perhaps you got one of his packs?
