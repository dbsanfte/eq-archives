Ummm....how about just being gracious about it and either ignore or help
some of these souls.  I have received many UNSOLICITED buffs by kind passing
strangers, and in return I do the same for others.  And it never hurts to
toss a few coins to a newbie.  They may (or may not) return the favor
someday.
Begging?  Ummmm.... I believe there is a Beg button, also.  Maybe you should
take that aspect up with Verant.
Safe travels...
