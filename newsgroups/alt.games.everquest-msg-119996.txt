I agree with your sentiments with respect to people suing. However, 
whether she should be suing or not doesn't mitigate or deny her
pain and suffering as a result of her sons death. I don't think anyone
could rationally reject that she must have been devastated by his
suicide, do you ? People who would use her suit as an excuse for
a lack of compassion, never really had any compassion in the first 
place.
