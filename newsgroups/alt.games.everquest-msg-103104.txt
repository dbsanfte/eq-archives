The key difference here is that Alcohol is not a substance that most people
easily become addicted to, that does not mean that for some people it is not
as bad, just that for most people it is not.  It usually takes long term
intake of large quantities of alcohol for someone to become dependant on it,
but there are some people who will become dependant much more easily than
others.
