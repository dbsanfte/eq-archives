 So would I, considering that they found the Challenger crew compartment
intact in the ocean, complete with  the crew.

 As for the person who said this was the wrong time, I disagree, Humor is a
way many people deal with shock or disbelief. I heard the first Challenger
joke less than two hours after the crash, on a BBS no less. Of course, the
internet was still a government project mostly then, so a 300bps modem on my
commodore 64 was my only means of cyberconversation.
 Humor is better than anger.
