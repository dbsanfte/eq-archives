The bastards have a high standing regen that makes 'em a real
pain to solo with low-med DPS classes.  They hit hard, but not
exceptionally so, and a significant part of that "more time to
kill" is due to their regen.  In a high DPS group a Druid can
"tank" there (I've done it grouped with 4 BLs and a Wizard,
dunno how those BLs planned to survive at higher level without
any Defense skill).  It's a shitty place to root-rot, and it's
not much use for a solo Paladin, Paladin+Enchanter survive fine
but kill kinda slow, a group of 3+ with at least one good damage
dealer does well (Druid+Warrior+anyDPS is good), Necros and Mages
seem to solo well there, but I've never played one so that's an
outsider's view.
