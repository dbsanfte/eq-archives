    Well, in a sense, everyone on the planet is dying.  We're not
immortal, and we know it.  But even though I am middle aged, and in all
likelihood only have another fourtyish years left, I don't really think
of myself as dying.  Sure, when my knee creeks a bit when I climb a set
of stairs I get a sense that I might be in a state of decline, but
dying?  Naw.

    I feel the same about EQL, in a way.  I believe (its my opinion,
Biz) that new users are going to be allot less likely to pick up EQL
over EQII or WoW, once WoW is actually available again.  It just makes
sense to me that people are more likely to pick up a newer game over
it's older parent given a choice.  Sure, some will make the choice to
get EQL.  But I don't think that the numbers of new users will make up
for the losses in population due to natural attrition in EQL. 

   But, I don't think that means EQL is dying.  This is the game that
for years was the juggernaught of MMORPG's.  It had a hugh population,
some of whom played with near fanaticism.  Many people, I suspect, will
only quit playing when the last server goes dark or when the coroner
pulls the sheet over their head.  If SOE is smart at all, (I know,
debatable) they will start releasing content that can be reasonably done
by guilds even with the smaller playerbase.  

  With just a bit of planning, EQL can trudge along with its creaking
knees for quite a while, I think.
