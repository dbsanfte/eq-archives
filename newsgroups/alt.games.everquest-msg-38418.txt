That answers how to get plat...but it raises another question: where
does the plat come from?  Say you loot an item that sells for 5K.  You
go to EC and find a buyer.  You've now got 5K plat.  But where did the
buyer get 5K?  Probably from selling items he got, and so on.  I wonder
where most of the actual plat in EQ comes from?
