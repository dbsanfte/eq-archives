It's no different than the old:
/shout 'heavily twinked warrior LFG'
I just consider it as an advanced idiot filter, anyone that feels the
need to advertise in that way isn't worth grouping with. The opposite
is also true, any group leader that asks whether a caster of mine has
KEI before being invited to a group isn't worth the hassle of grouping
with either way.
