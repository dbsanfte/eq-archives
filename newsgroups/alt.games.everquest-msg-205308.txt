Mem a bunch of spells.

Right click on the little book icon at the base of your memorized spell
list.

Select Save Spell List

Game will prompt you for a name for this list.

Repeat as often as you like, changing all the spells, just one spell,
whatever.  Maximum of ten spell lists memorized.

Now, when you want to swap spells around, right click on that icon
again, select Load Spell List, then click on one of the names.

You will sit down, Erase all the spells you have memmed that aren't the
same spell in the same slot as when you saved, and then mem each spell
in order from the top down.  Memming takes normal time, but I've never
seen anyone able to unmem and select which spells they want to mem this
quickly, using this process cuts my time to swap a raft of spells to a
third for a "they are all on one page, I do this all the time" list,
and to perhaps a sixth for a list that would send me to several
different pages and make me a little uncertain.

If you get interrupted in the middle of memming a bunch of spells, when
you regain control you can just select load and that list again and
you'll rapidly fill in the missing slots.

Another good trick is to set up a "save" list with some blank spaces,
if ten saved lists isn't enough for you; this will allow you to leave a
wide variety of spells in the spaces that are blank on that list, and
the list won't change them when you load it.  With ten lists I haven't
run into this problem, in fact I'm not certain  it works, I remember
testing it just after it was patched in and it seems to me it did work
this way, but I never use the feature.

Remember when you hit a new spell level to go thru and update all your
lists carefully; at one point my six year old was looking over my
shoulder and asked why I was using my lower level pet; he'd read the
name of the spell being memmed, which was guardian spirit instead of
frenzied spirit.  Since the icon is the same, and it was on a list I
don't use that much, I hadn't noticed I forgot to change it!
