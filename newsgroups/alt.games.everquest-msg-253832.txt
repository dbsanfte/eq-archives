It has three "success" checks.  First, you have to be successful at the
actual intimidate.  At 200 skill, I'm successul somewhere between 1/3 and
1/2 of the time.  Then, the kick has to land, which as you noticed is not
guaranteed.  Whether that is affected by skill in kick I don't know, but it
wouldn't be an outlandish assumption.  Then, it can be resisted (at my
level, it's *always* resisted and is used to generate aggro rather than
actually fear something).

I never used intimidate for its "real" purpose.  It just wasn't dependable
enough (and when I was at the level where I might have considered it, you
had to have kick ungreyed as a monk for it to go off).  I think I tried it
out twice and just consigned it to the junk bin.  I finally got the last 10
points of skill in it over the past year (it is a slooooow skill to raise).

It's a great taunt though, for a class that can't taunt.
