It is amazing how few people can be bothered to show a bit of
courtesy.  My paladin almost never refused SoW by druids/shamen,
even when they are grouped.  Why?  Perhaps because the request is
always prefaced by an offer of payment (either pp or, caster's
choice, buff(s) for the caster or his/her tank/puller).  It is
interesting to note that the same tactic is less successful
seeking Clarity from an enchanter.  As best I can figure the
difference is that druids are so tired of being harassed by
beggars that a courteous request for a trade really stands out
in a positive way, while enchanters are used to being offered
SoW and etc. for Clarity, so it's nothing special to them.

Ya know Biz, that sweet tongue of yours had you hovering on the edge
of my KF for the longest time, until I finally decided that most of
your targets had earned the scorn you heap on them.  Now I just avoid
reading your posts when my children are around.
