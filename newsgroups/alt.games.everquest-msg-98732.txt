When I saw what all the patch was going to cover I took the night
off EQ.  Was easy really since I had just got back Sunday from a 9
day stint in Cozumel and the Grand Caymans  (beautiful places with
lots of Rum and sun).  Having a hard time going back to EQ now for
some reason.  Want to move to Cozumel more than I want to play, only
thing stopping me is the bar tab hehe.
