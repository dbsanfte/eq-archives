I had something last week when my mage went to level 4 and I went to
get trained in her Level 4 skill (sorry no sleep last night so brain
can't recall the actual skill) when I went to the trainer and opened
up the skill window the skill in questions said 'Level 4' but I wasn't
allowed to do anything with it.
