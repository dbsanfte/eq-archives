Quite correct, I'm not acting morally, according to my own morals.  And this
is due directly to the fact that current jurisprudence dictates that I be
punished for acting in a moral fashion.

Random slayings, no.  The demonstration of justification would preclude
their being random.  But yes, my preferred moral framework would set me up
to kill certain people.  It also, of course, sets me up to avoid killing
certain people who I personally feel the world would be better off without,
but my moral stance dictates that, personal feelings aside, they must be let
live.  (Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka, alas, being examples.)

Robert A. Heinlein's quotation on "Duty".  I've got it centrepiece on the
Paladins page of my website.

When I was spending a bunch of time in LGuk, my Paladin would not aid anyone
being attacked by live frogs.  The live frogs are being oppressed by the
undead but are not themselves evil.  There's even a Froglok Paladin to prove
the point.  Thus, Reyder never attacked them.  His recommendation to the
person fighting was *always* to zone out.  If the person won the fight,
Reyder would heal them.  But while they were fighting, he wouldn't
interfere.  Got yelled at several times by people for not helping.  The only
people who understood and accepted were the Ogres and Trolls hunting there.

That's a Paladin acting morally and severely ticking off a bunch of people
in the process.
