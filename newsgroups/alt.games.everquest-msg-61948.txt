Thats just not true. Wurmslayer is *not* as good as a Primal weapon, true,
its not even optimum or very desired past about 51 or so, but its still
a *fine* weapon. If your warriors are so used to everyone having suber
vulak loot that they cant conceive of a warrior being able to hold taunt
using a wurmslayer they are merely completely out of touch with everyone
else.

Not ever warrior in the game is going to be taunting off a group with max
haste primals. Its absurd to suggest they are.

Now go wipe your drool. Geez, what is it with the superiority complexes in
here? Can nobody hold a civil conversation and disagree with others without
resorting to the "Im correct and you're lobotmised" line of argument?
