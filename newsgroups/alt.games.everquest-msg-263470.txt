I think a lot of it revolved around people (whiners) complaining so much 
about this social aspect that forced designers to rethink the game design 
for the masses.  I.E. 'why should I have to group I don't have time to 
group I want to be uber soloing' rants over and over until the games 
dumbed down to accomodate.  So we're at a point where there are two games 
to play, with the resultant sour-taste compromise.  The 'single player 
experience' and the 'social player experience', with both such a 
compromise that neither are enjoyable.

Ben's statement above is the mantra they should strive for, and ignore 
the players who don't want that.  There are a zillion single player games 
out there that can be played at their own pace, their own time, with no 
mandatory evil social interaction at all.  

But they won't go away and do that, and the results equal these dead 
quiet running through the zones kind of experiences that are so lonely 
feeling they stink.  Scrolling chatter of every sort from auctions to 
yells for help to train screams to questions made EQ alive.  No game has 
come remotely close to matching those first two years or so.
