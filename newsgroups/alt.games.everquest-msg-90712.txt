I agree!  It feels great to know that others made it when your own survival
was extremely questionable...  LOL

However...  I have several friends that I group with often...  One in
particular is a lvl 30 Wizzie.  He (as a person) is a GREAT guy!  Funny,
friendly, easy going, etc...  I love grouping with him.  However, he dies
everywhere!  LOL  His Corpse Run Skill is always maxed for his current
level.

Anyway, recently we were hunting in either Paw or Perma...  I think it was
Paw.  We were inside and we REALLY needed to zone...  LOL  As a Ranger, I
can tank a lil bit, but not like our Warrior...  I screamed RUN and everyone
started to bail.  Warrior went down so I became the main tank.  RUN RUN ZONE
RUN!!!  Everyone else zones and I turn to run and here is the Wizzie
standing there trying to fight mobs...  LOL

I said RUN NOW!  He said, "I'm not going to let you die!"  If I could have
taken my character and grabbed his character by his ear and drug him through
the zone I would have...  LOL  As it turned out we all made it but barely.

We got to the other side and then I find out he was OOM the whole time.
Tell me plz, how was he going to not let me die?  LMAO!  I wasn't about to
leave the zone as long as he was alive and therefore had he gone down, I
would have followed soon after I'm sure.

Basically folks, use your own judgement but if you stay when the order to
Run is given, don't expect help with CR...  hehe

Of course in our little group, that last bit doesn't apply because we're a
tight bunch, but for the most part...  hehe

Be well!
