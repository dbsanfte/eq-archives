I'm pretty much staying with DAoC. Sure, the game is still in "post beta"
but heck, it has only been out for less than two months. There is still
crap being fixed in EQ after more than two years! At least Mythic is being
very upfront; unlike Verant, they are not saying "Oh, we NEVER promised
that this skill or that ability would be added! Our previous press
releases were in error."

Yes, DAoC has some frustrations and limitations... like all other such
games. However, I find the frustrations of Dark Ages of Camelot to be much
more bearable than the frustrations of EverQuest.
