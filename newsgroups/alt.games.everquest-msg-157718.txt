Irrelevent. The core of your guild has been together considerably longer
than that I'd wager. Even though the 'name' may only be 3 months old,
it's almost certain that a decent proportion of the playmakers in the
new guild have been playing together for a long time, if you're in a
position to0 take down raid level mobs

>Secondly, it wast the item, but the policy that got up my nose. (see the
>difference?)

What policy? That a full member could have more rights to loot than an
invite on one of their first raids? What policy would you suggest to
replace it?

Why did you join this 'high level raiding guild'? Why didn't you find
out about core issues like raid/exp focus and loot distribution. Most
importantly, why didn't you privately contact an officer or raid planner
to put your concerns across, rather than repeating yourself in guild
chat for 15 minutes when it was clear the leaders of your guild had
already made a decision?

I know this problem only too well, because I'm an officer in my guild.
Some people want to explore, some want to raid, some want to grind exp
to L60 asap. Decisions are made on what'll best benefit the guild.
Killing mobs only available for 1 day out of 7 is clearly more
beneficial than 7 days exping rather than 6. The officers aren't stupid,
I'm sure they know about the benefits of being L65 over L60.

Lastly, I think you're overestimating the benefits of exp on the first
days of an expansion. For personal experience, yesterday before raids, I
made a net loss of 5% real exp through 'exploring' and 'testing' new
areas (like Tribunal trials). When raids started we killed Exiled,
Glyphed, Cursed, Blood, Emp, and Seru, gaining ~10 endgame item upgrades
for guildmembers. The increase in power to the guild from those items
substantially outweighed the exp benefit even if every last member of
the raid was in a solid exp group for the time we spent raiding.

Maybe high level raiding isn't for you. If it is, you'd do well to
retain a more open mind, and not call for the waaaambulance every time
you fail to see the whole picture.
