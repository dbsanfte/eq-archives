Back in December, me thinks, they announced plans for shortly after the new
year of a new server coming up.  Then from what I've read via reports from
the San Diego convention is that there's a new PVP server in the works with
a new ruleset.

I am very curious as to these new rules, I'd think they're going to be a mix
between the current rules for the current PVP servers.

Or if they could get the server to be a true Race/Religeon server, that
would probably be the most realistic server in the game for roleplaying.
