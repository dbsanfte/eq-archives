Clearly you didn't give the license a thorough read:

"Accounts are available only to adults or, in their discretion, their
minor child.  If you are a minor, your parent(s) or guardian(s) must
complete the registration process, in which case they will take full
responsibility for all obligations under this Agreement. By clicking
the "I Accept" button and providing us with a credit card number, you
represent that you are an adult and are either accepting this
Agreement on behalf of yourself or your child."

So, in answer to your question, no, you're not to believe that a 9 yr
old child must purchase this game on her own and use her OWN credit
card to pay for it!!

I predict she's not really going to enjoy the game much.
