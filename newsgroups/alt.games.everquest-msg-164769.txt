bard's mana works a bit different from normal mana.
But as a dru main i can't say i need it badly but it surely helps a big lot.
the +25 inc in wis means a biggermanapool and regaining faster mana.
Effectively it means bigger or more mobs in the same time and less downtime.
Especially when soloing in a good group depending on role i don't mind it
that much unless i'm the mainhealer//buffer (read group is lacking shammy
and cleric) in such situations i definately like to have KEI. Another thing
i like to have kei for is practicing tradeskills wich are not trivial yet.
It reduces the succesyield sometimes but it definately increases askill
advance.
