Don't have the game yet because I need some upgrades first, but my daughter
got her copy and I played a little on the weekend. I like it so far and I'm
looking forward to trying it out.

I think I'd like to play a rogue or assassin class. My first character in EQ
was a rogue, but the class was not designed the way I imagined rogues would
be so I was a little disappointed. It looks like they have made a lot of
changes to that class, and added another one that might even be more like
what I'd like to do.

Has anyone here played a Rogue/Assassin class in EQII to a high enough level
to tell me what it's like?

Have they added enough specialized skills to these classes to make them
different and necessary to groups? Can they solo better than EQ? I always
imagined a rogue as a sneaky, independent, clever, trickster type character
(and deadly to boot!) is the class more like this in EQII? What about
poisons as a skill? Do they still have them? Do they work better?

Any other Rogue/Assassin info you would care to add would be helpful.

Thanks a bunch!
