A political system in which the Republicans find themselves lobbying for 
Ralph Nader is fucked beyond any possibility of repair. When people can 
actually vote for what they *want*, and not for what they are given, I 
may start buying into the idea of representative democracy. Direct 
democracy is not unworkable... they do that in Switzerland, but there's 
very few countries I'd trust to pull it off without turning into mob 
rule hell.

I definitely agree that computers are the future of voting... I want to 
be able to do things like splitting my vote (half to X, half to Y), to 
cast a negative vote (reduce X's tally by one), and even casting *smart* 
votes (vote for X, unless Y is ahead of Z, in which case, vote for Y).
