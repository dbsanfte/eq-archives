 Apparently not. Perhaps you should be a consultant to Verant and tell
them when their fixes warrant a patch or not.

 Just because that's the only things they list doesn't mean that's the
only things they are working on or have fixed. You don't think that only
things that have changed are things they list in the patch message, do
you?
