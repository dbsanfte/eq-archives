Think JK was just pointing out the only real concern for strength,
encumbrance. Not suggesting he pay any attention to it.

I bet you've never had this concern with your tank (even with that fitted
kitchen you carry with you) you're an Ogre and I'd imagine your natural
strength is higher than mine is armoured and armed. Me, on the other hand,
well, I just upgraded my BP (Barbed Ringmail to Engraved Royal Velium) lost
2 strength and gained 7.5 in weight.../sigh.

Anyway, the OP is a Ranger so at least his armour will be generally lighter
than that of a Warrior, encumbrance shouldn't be an issue.
