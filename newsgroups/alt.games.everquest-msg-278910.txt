It was a while back but I dont think we used a documented method (as I dont
think it worked), we were running around for a while till we found a sly
way...cant remember the the details but it was a jump somewhere on the sky
walkways.  We pulled the reaver / boss through the door using a pet.

I dont play anymore so cant describe it very well or go back and find out...
