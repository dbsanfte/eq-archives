Not quite true.  I've had a GM recover my corpse from the zoneline in OOT
( BB zoneline ).  I was on the boat ( my Necro ), and a Seafury was
"Camping" the Sister Isle dock, and wasted pretty much everyone on the boat.
When I finally made it back to OOT, triangulation showed my corpse to be at
that zoneline, where I heard it would probably end up.

I petitioned, and the GM had no problem putting my corpse on the Sister Isle
dock.

As that same Necro a lvl or 2 later, I helped someone else CR at the same
place - that zoneline.  Wasn't too hard for them to get, either with Lev to
get there and EB to breathe.

If I had known about the Enduring Breath spell when I got killed, I wouldn't
have petitioned the GM.  I assumed that I would not be able to get to the
corpse without dying, so I petitioned.
