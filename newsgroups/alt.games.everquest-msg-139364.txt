Did she?  I'd say namecalling started with Mr. Wizzard's post on 16 Jul 
2002, where he used 'PC fuck' in a sentence to describe anyone who might 
support an HIV+ muppet.  You were quick to agree with said name-calling 
insult, add 'utterly pathetc' to the list of disparaging adjectival 
phrases, and share it with several groups in which such people might 
reside (17 Jul 2002 04:01:01 GMT).  Now, if you can find an earlier 
insult from Lesa, perhaps you will have a point.

}Don't let the door hit you on your ample ass on the way out...

Oh, hey, look!  Another personal attack!  But God forbid you should be 
repaid in kind, or the whining will never cease.
