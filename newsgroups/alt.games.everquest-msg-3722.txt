Actually, I think it would be just the opposite.    Only critical failures on
Beg act as a taunt.  If you have 100 skill, you're not going to get many of
these, compared to 3 skill.

A successful beg gets you a copper or two and no aggro, a normal failure gets
you nothing, but no aggro.  If you're using it as a poor mans taunt, then you
*want* the critical failure that pisses them off.
