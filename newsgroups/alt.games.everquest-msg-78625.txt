Yeah, the way to make it so it can use EVERY port in EQ still is this:

After you approve the EQ exe and eq game.exe, back back out of EQ.

Then go to programs under zone alarm, right click on them and hit
"allow server" you will then see both checks marked by them and they
can fully send info back and forth unhindered just in case otherwise
some of those ports would be blocked.
