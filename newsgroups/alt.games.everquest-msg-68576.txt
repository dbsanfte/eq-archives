I wouldnt go THAT far.  I am a Grandmaster Fletcher on MT, not the
highest (AFAIK tied for 3rd on the server at 206) but likely the most
active.  I have indeed profitted from it but I also worked really hard
to build a reputation and take the time to build a clientele by
spending a LOT of time in EC promoting myself as well as various
incentive programs for some customers.  On average I sell 6 to 8 bows
a week, of which 2 to 3 are Darkwoods and over 20,000 arrows a month.


Does this mean that Fletching is an easy money maker?  No.  It means
that I busted my backside to make it profitable for me and was able to
take the time to do so because I dont believe the only thing in this
game that matters is LEVEL LEVEL LEVEL=)

I am also well ahead on Brewing thanks to Heady Kiolas.  It is always
funny when a tailor I know, who is 20+ points ahead of me in Brewing,
would rather pay me 200p to make him 10 stacks of Heady Kiolas than
make them himself=)  When Wu's first came out I made 62 stacks of
Kiolas for a nice profit=)
