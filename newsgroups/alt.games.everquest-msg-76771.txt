I don't think that not on the hate list is a reasonable criteria, 
especially for necros.  They generally cast darkness, fear, send pet, then 
DOT and med.  If they can't med while the pet chases the feared mob, they 
lose a bunch of effeciency.  Also, don't many mobs that you've 
successfully feigned still keep you on their hate list, and aggro when you 
come back in a much greater aggro range?  This could make it impossible to 
for an active necro to med while breaking a camp.  (I've watched a good 60 
necro break a room, a ton of stuff going on and he's medding in-between 
every cast.)
