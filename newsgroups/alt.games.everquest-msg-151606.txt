Don't look at the text.  Look at the onscreen compass.  Whenever you get a
success at Sense Heading, the compass adjusts to your correct heading, *AND*
it acts as if you have a SH skill of 200 for a few seconds, tracking your
heading changes perfectly, before going back to its random swinging.

This is also useful if you are trying to go in an exact direction.  As soon
as you see a SH success, you can use the compass to aim precisely.
