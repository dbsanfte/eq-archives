Well here's my magelo - much of it is from bazaar.  I'm in a raiding
guild now, but have a long ways to go on DKP before I start serious
upgrading.

You might look at the Hardened Sludge Tunic or Phase Spider Carapace
as a chest upgrade.

When you get 60, go get some Velium Inlaid Claws - /rawr I love these
things.

Depending on pattern prices, I'd strongly suggest you go get some
Ornate leather boots.  FT3 for usually well under 10k is too good to
pass up.  I have the boots of the beastlord, but they stay bagged
unless I'm shrinking for raids (saves a spell slot).

Many things you could use to upgrade that Goranga idol...  drawing a
blank on a cheap one. Idol of the Wavecrasher?  Not sure if that's
what I'm thinking of or not.

Mantle of Ill Omen is pretty generic beast shoulders.

Watchman's Breeches would be worth looking into.

In general, try and lose items without HP/STA on 'em.   One item
without HP on it that you might look at though - the Axgoreth's belt
that drops in ME.  You and your guild should be able to farm that up
easily enough.

Just some thoughts off the top of my head.  Hope it helps in some way.
