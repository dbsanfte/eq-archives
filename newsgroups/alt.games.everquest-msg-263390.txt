Sorry, forgot to address this in my first reply.

Just the general mechanical style of play. The way your char turns 
towards the mob when you attack it, the way the spells work, countdown 
timers etc. The graphic style reminds me of CoH even though it is of a 
different time and era. As you can tell, I really can't put the exact 
feeling into words. All I can say is that as soon as I entered the Isle 
of Refuge, CoH came to mind and the feeling grew from there.
