#1 You have to learn what role playing is first. Role-playing is not being an asshole.
Lets say am sitting around a table playing a P&P role-playing game and I pour a pop
in the lap of the person next to me. The other people around the table will rightly
look at me as if I was nuts. Can't I just say 'What? I was just role-playing evil!'
They would say 'No you were being an asshole.'

Just like when we were kids its called 'PRETEND.' When you play cops and
robbers and cowboys and Indians you don't actually shoot each other.

Examples: Evil character comes up to my good character and insults and taunts
him in public say channel. Privately he sends a tell politely asking for a Sow.
I give him the SoW while publicly telling him that I am giving him the speed of
the wolf to run away like the coward he is. That is role-PLAYING.

With your example of the cleric: if I was playing the evil cleric I would absolutely
give the rez all the while preaching to the dead player of the power of my god
that is bringing him back to life. That is role-PLAYING.

Role-playing can be done in any game. Game mechanics cannot force people
to role play. It can never work unless the players themselves wish to role-play.
