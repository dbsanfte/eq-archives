That is, assuming I don't make my own guild (only got a taste of that in
EQ, but I enjoyed it). But I joke with myself that no guild can turn down
having their own in-guild artist. After a month's work (ok, I work slow
still), I finished this picture for my poor guild.

OK, it's not a masterpiece. But I thought some of you might enjoy it
anyhow.  

(SIDENOTE: "The Luggage" really deserved better than to have the 4 out of
the 5 of us get sick of EQ (if we hadn't quit there were 3, count them
*3*!, people interested in joining us...argh).  But since I couldn't do
that, I at least gave It a good month of my creative-life's blood.  Poor
Haelin, the dwarf in the Hawaiin shirt, still holds out hope that we'll
come back.)
