A poor engine, badly programmed could in theory slow your machine to
unusability .. would be an art to be that bad, though :) And you
understimate the polygon load. A deep scene with high resolution 3D
models has hundres of thousands of triangles. Even most modern cards
get a problem at some point, also with loading textures etc. Don't
think of your card as a super SGI graphics machine. Even the best
PC cards go to their knees, crying, when you load them with a lot
to render.

: clipping?

The next best NVidia card (or whatever, if better shows up). RAM will not
help you render more and CPU speeds have less of an impact than some years
ago.
