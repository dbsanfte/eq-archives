Newly popularized recreational activities are often addictive.

Forgive me for suggesting it, but I suspect you're exaggerating.

If you're suggesting AD&D, in it's prime, only impacted the grades of
one out of two hundred die hard AD&D players, you're just flat out
wrong.

Your conclusions simply aren't justified.  People often don't like
admitting their addictions to THEMSELVES.  (I should know, I was
addicted to EverQuest.  Just one more hour...  I'm just popping in to
say hi...  I'm going to call in sick today because I feel like playing
EverQuest...  I guess I'd better stop playing EverQuest and spend some
time with my wife...  I'm going to stop as soon as I ding...)

With all due respect, you just don't know how addicted those other
people were.  Either they didn't tell you even though they knew it, or
they didn't even know it themselves, or they somehow managed to juggle
their addiction AND their other responsibilities (such as school
work).  I suspect A LOT of AGE'ers fall into this category.

I'm NOT implying they were ALL addicted, but "one out of hundreds" is
just downright bad scientific evidence on your part.  The study was
woefully unscientific.

Addictive personalities can end up addicted to just about anything,
but truth be told, some things are more addictive than others.  You'd
need to study addiction to understand what it is about things that
make them more addictive than other things in general.

It's clearly not true to say, "I knew a guy who was addicted to eating
dirt, so eating dirt is just as addictive as EverQuest".  Ya, showing
that someone was addicted to dirt is amusing and interesting and
fascinating, but it doesn't show that eating dirt has the same
"addictive" qualities as things that are typically considered
addictive, like gambling, alcohol abuse, drugs, and EverQuest.

If what you're suggesting was true, you'd see "Dirt Eaters Anonymous"
and "Softball Players Anonymous" and "Poodle Skirt Wearers Anonymous"
and "Nose Pickers Anonymous".  But you don't.  Because things like
alcohol, sex, drugs, TV, and EverQuest have certain properties that
make them addictive.

By the way, I'm not suggesting I pick my nose.  Well, I do, but only
when I think nobody else is looking.  And if they see me, I'm too old
to really care much anymore, because I sure as hell know they pick
their nose too, the big liars.

This just plain doesn't change the fact that overall some things are
more addictive than others.  Look it up.
