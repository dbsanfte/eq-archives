    I'm starting work on the 7th Coldain shawl and have been in Kael raiding
the arena area several times.  I've yet to see any Royal Blood drop.  Which
mobs in Kael drop this?  Can any of the ones in the arena area, or must it
be a Named one?

    I'm also thinking of starting the Ring quests.  Im not sure of the names
of each ring, so am having problems looking them up on Allakazhams.  If
anyone could give me the names for those quests, or point me in the right
direction, I'd appreciate it.

    Thanks.
