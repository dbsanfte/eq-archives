Double cost and round down is a good guide line, again I can't see much
there that is worth having for the cost. Sure you could use the Chloro to
reduce downtime (but then wait for it to wear off before fighting again,
check the penalties) The Quickness potion and gate potions might be useful
but the quickness one is 40pp to make and the gate ones 170pp to make, give
the possible failures and lost components on making these items they won't
be selling cheap,
