I did that with snakeskins, too - not even one snakeskin 
appeared.  OTOH, the other day there was an ogre (whew - 
almost typed 'orge' 0:) ) sitting outside West Freeport 
offering 20 plat for a stack of batwings + 2.  I 
messaged him and asked if he knew he could buy them in 
the casters guild (not having seen him yet) - when he 
explained his problem, I told him if he'd lend me the 
money, I'd go grab his batwings for him.  He gave me 
*thirty plat* to run to the casters guild and back.  
What a lovely, lovely day that was :)

enchanter already had 80 plat and my 19th level shaman 
was going "please, can somebody port me for 3 plat, it's 
all I've got..." the other day :()
