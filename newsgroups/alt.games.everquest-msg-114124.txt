I don't see it here, or on the class specific boards I frequent. Where
are these "more and more" people complaining at? My connections have
been rock solid since I started playing EQ in Aug of 1999. The only
times I have gone LD happened when the server crashed, or my cable ISP
dropped my connection.

I am not saying that people are not having problems, but if it was as
bad as you make it sound there would be hundreds or thousands of
people posting about it. You just don't see that many.
