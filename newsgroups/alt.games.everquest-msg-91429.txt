 The new Geforce drivers did not fix the trouble for me.  Still have
visual problems in game.  I still talk to other people that have
video issues with Geforce cards.  Mine is a 500 TI that I bought so
I would not have game trouble but I still get choppy video and can't
begin to use any of the new models. For the record I have 768mb of
RAM and use windows XP (if any of that matters). I like and enjoy
the game, but lets be real here, video and sound issues are things
that should be high on priority because they can and do make the
game more enjoyable.  After all we play for the enjoyment, if not
for that we would never buy the game to begin with.
