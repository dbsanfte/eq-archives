This explains a tremendous amount.  More than any other class a
bard is dependent on a decent connection.  I stopped playiny my
bard, my first main, when I switched ISP's and my ping went from
180 (consistent) to 350 with spikes, it destroyed my ability to
twist songs well.

Where do you live and what server do you play on?  If you 
can't move to a closer server (IE you live in Europe and
are currently playing  on an American server) you might consider
a different main than a bard ... you just lose too much as
a bard with a bad connection.
