Having both a 65 chanter & 65 cleric, I can tell you the cleric will get far
more group offers, even when not lfg, but the chanter is FAR more fun to
play, at least once you become a level 65 charming dps monster. Chanters
have just about the most versatile & adrenaline filled role in EQ. Clerics
have the most repetetive & unrelenting. You shouldnt play either if you like
to be able to afk a bit more than most people.
As for servers rank them by population & check each time you log on to play,
to see which are most populated.
