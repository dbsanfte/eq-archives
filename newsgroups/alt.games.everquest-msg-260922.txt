Volume?  You mean they play that irritating music while zoning?
I long since turned off the music because, back when I first
started playing, I was spending 5-7 minutes just logging onto
a server, and that music gets VERY tiresome long before then!

As for the visual splash, I can understand people getting antsy
when the screen goes black and stays that way for several seconds;
I've often wondered whether I was going to succeed in zoning or
crash.  So having something else is better than extended black,
and I can certainly appreciate if putting up an image helps avoid
some DX9 bugs or whatever.  But I'd still much rather have my old
zone show until they're ready to show me the new one; it makes it
especially realistic when zoning by movement as opposed to
transports, since the new scene tends to match the old.  Putting
the splash in between breaks the illusion bigtime.

I do like a lot of the other graphics improvements.  The sunset
on the water in Nedaria's Landing was quite impressive, especially
around 5-6pm when the pink sky was reflecting off the wavecaps.
And the shadows do make things look more realistic -- until you
notice that they show up indoors, and when outside a room you can
see shadows of characters in the room, etc.  But again, in the
places where they did it right, it really helps the sense of
immersion.  Sure, I had to turn them off to reduce lag, but if I
had a more powerful box I might leave them on; they look really
nice.

I also very much like the black-embossing on the font for names,
and the way corpses fade now.  (I think they must've stolen that
from City of Heroes. :-)

On the other hand, it looks like they broke Luclin again: I went
to show some friends the view of Norrath overhead, and all I found
was a "moon" in the sky over Hollowshade.  It was a very nice moon,
with clouds drifting past it etc., but it's WRONG!  They broke
that when DX9 came out, and only recently fixed it, and now it's
broken again!  /sigh...
