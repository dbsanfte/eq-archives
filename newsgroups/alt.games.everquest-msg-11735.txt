Like a child with candy being dangled in front of you.


It would be cruel to laugh and not give it out.


Good thing I'm not cruel.




Fleeting quiver: HQ lion skin (very rare drop), 1 griffon feather,
aviak egg oil (brewing skill: combine foraged aviak egg with 1 flask
water in a brew barrel), vial of distilled mana, fleeting quiver
pattern. NOT trivial at tailoring 209. Weights 0.4, 6 slot ARROW ONLY,
weight reduction 60%, speed bonus -6 (ie it takes 6 off of the net
speed of your bow and arrows. This is a GOOD THING.)

Given the cost of the components and the extremely high level of skill
required, there is discussion of this selling for about 200pp or more.
