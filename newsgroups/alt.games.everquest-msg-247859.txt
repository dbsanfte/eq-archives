I can run range/enchanter charm duoing on one computer but man it's
dangerous, when the ranger goes to pull I don't see charm breaks (they
aren't grouped), if I pull with enchanter I run out of mana too
easily.

I should get a horse for enchanter except I am resistant to turning on
new models. :-(

All hypothetical atm though since the new dx engine has fuxored my
ability to run two windows again in some zones, especially Luclin and
later.

If I ever did it again I'd go beastlord/necro.
