Yup. But with a standard communications protocol the update to each is
relatively minor, and is the cost of having a scp. And if you are
going to change your protocol.. it had better be updated on each
system. The nice part.. with a standard communications protocol...
everybody is on the same field. This is *HOW* it is supposed to be
done... so that you can log on with a mac and you have 0 difference in
how you access anything. Or unix.. or this.. or that. The cost in not
doing it is immense in that you have to maintain two different code
bases.. two different protocols and over the time the one not
maintained due to lack of subscribers goes the way of the dodo.

Ya.. and look how that worked out.. either they're serious about
supporting mac(not 'making a mac version') or not. They weren't.
