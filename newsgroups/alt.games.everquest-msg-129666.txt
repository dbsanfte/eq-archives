No, the Palestinians lost their right to that land when the lost the second
world war.  How about this, what if I were to buy a house from you.  Twenty
years later, you come in and say that that house is your homeland, that is,
you grew up there, and start causing trouble.  Do you have a valid claim?
You lost your right to that land when you sold it.  The Ottoman Empire lost
their right to that land when they signed the treaty that ended their part
in WWII.

True, I'll grant you that.  AI condemns the Palestineians almost as much as
they do Isreal.  They are very one sided, though, it's just that their
dividing line isn't Palestine/Isreal.  AI finds a reason to call just about
anything a "human rights violation."  That makes them very unreliable as a
judge of what truely is a violation or not.  It's the boy who cried wolf
thing (or, just to make it on topic in an EQ group, the bard who cried
train).

Watch it some time.  Listen to what they say, and what they fail to say.
Since Fox News came out, they've been more careful about their overt biases.
