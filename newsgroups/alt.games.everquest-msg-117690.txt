Hmmm... that's very useful info to have for someone like me
who has never played a bard, but is considering giving it a
try!  Thanks for posting that!

BTW, I have a Nostromo n50 Speedpad, which I can create macros
and attach them to each button.  I'm contemplating making each
button do a "123" or "234" or such like you did above, just
without my fingers getting as tired.  Has anyone tried using
a n50 like this?  Here's the homepage for it if anyone is
interested -- when you click this, the real (super long) link
will be displayed at the bottom -- just click on that next.
