I mean numerically, since DoTs dont say "xxx hits xxx for n points of non

Yes, however, I do know at least 1 Abjuration Druid, they were switched to
abjuration to PL alts on a second account when the guy got tired of being a
Druid.

Then there was the time some guy macroed a spell to get his specialization
and he went afk for an hour or so, came back to specialize: divination at
150 or so, he screamed to the zone a few times about that one, he memmed the
spell in the wrong slot, chain casted camo rather than snare or burst of
flame or whatever he was going for.  (Don't ask me how, must've been an
idiot or something)

Yep.
