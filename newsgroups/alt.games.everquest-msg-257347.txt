It depends. If you view ranger as a synonym for 'game keeper' he
wasn't. But if you view it as 'woodsman' or 'outdoorsman', 'wanderer',
all of which are perfectly viable interpretations I'd say he very
much was ;)

I've always thought of rangers as less militarized soldiers,
outdoorsmen tending to themselves and defending themselves without
the hierachy of the 'warrior' castes. Thats a pretty broad scope
;) It has room for archers, swordsmen, wrestlers, horsemen, whatever.
