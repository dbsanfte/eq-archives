Well, I don't think there is anything wrong with that as such. First of
all Theory of Probability claims that in events like that each number is
as likely to be rolled as any other with probability of 0.01 (1:100).
And the events are 'independent', which means each result is as likely
as any other regardless of what has been rolled previously.
The 'me players' always view high consecutive rolls suspiciously, but
consecutive low rolls don't attract their attention. I'm not saying he
wasn't cheating, but I _am_ saying him actually being lucky with rolls
(anyone actually considered a bug giving him high rolls??) is far more
likely.

As for leaving the group shortly after getting an item - isn't that the
right thing to do?
I have not been in lower guk for a while now, but last time I was there
there were people on lists _waiting_ to get into specific room groups
(pretty much like HH, only 20 levels later). Once he got what he came
there for why not move on and make room for someone who would also like
to have a go at specific mob?

I would view the descriptions of events with suspicion, actually. I can
understand _one_ group being a bunch of mugs and letting him roll for a
drop when he hasn't contributed, but events taking place as described
are, IMO, much less likely than rolling a 100 at least 100 times on the
trot. Things like this just don't happen. You don't contribute you are
asked to leave the group (or booted out) by the second combat the
latest. And you don't even get to roll for anything.
I can see him getting maybe 1 or 2 drops if he gets it in different
groups and it is the first drop each time. You could, most likely, hear
about it after the first drop in /ooc.
Rolls second time on the drop he just won in the same group after not
contributing? NO WAY! You can't possibly find 5 people that would play
EQ, be on the same server, on at the same time, and grouped in one
location yet silly enough to allow this to happen.

Absolutely. Informing what 'wonderful player' he is would be a service,
but what does it have to do with informing the zone how consistent he is
rolling high numbers?
