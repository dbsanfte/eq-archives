    Well for clarity's sake I'm not bitter about any computer games that I
can think of. If you want to talk about high school or my father's dealings
with the tax dept then I can be bitter but they were both was a long time
ago.

    My post was in fact, pure humour. I realise that many people didn't see
any humour in it, which I really feel is as much a reflection on them as it
is on my obscure and admittedly troublesome sense of humour. Most of the
satire was centered around how silly and unimaginitive I think the new
additions are, with a recurring joke about rangers getting screwed in every
expansion (Which actually seemed to offend rangers instead of make them
laff, so i missed the boat there) and a one-liner about bards being gay
(yes, they look camp, no, im not homophobic) that also caused more trouble
than it was worth, although more ppl seemed to find that bit amusing than
any other bit, even my bit about SK's getting foraged vegetables for a pet
which at the time had me in stitches. Ok so I was very drunk at the time (we
found this neato 95% spirits in a bottle shop near my friends place) but I
*Still* find that part the most amusing. Possibly because I've been using
pets with the approximate killing power of foraged vegetables for 50 levels.

    At the bottom off the post I did apologise in advance for pissing anyone
off and explain that the post was for humour value only. In future I'll put
that up the top in all caps surrounded by lots of stars and care-bare
stickers in the vague hope that ppl take it on board.

Cheers,
James
