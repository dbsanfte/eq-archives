/em turns green with jealousy   :)

I'm not posting my magelo!  Actually I don't
worry about it too much, about the fact that
my unbuffed int is 200 (I should move my 
overseer's ring and brell's girdle to a bag
except for when I'm actively canni-petting, I
have to replace my Hive Fiend's Brain (my 
buddy was using my mage to CoH a raid into
ToV and left it in a summoned bag!) and I
haven't gotten around to a solstice earring.)

Thing is I'm not spending *ANY* money until
I get my essential spectral spells, everything
I earn gets saved on the off chance they ever
hit the bazaar.  I search every day and so
far I've seen Child of Ro for 3500, nice price
for the single most worthless 61+ pet we have,
Shield of Maelin for 5k, not bad considering
it's just an upgrade to shield of the Arcane
and Black Steel for 20k - one I desperately
need but was short the cash for (and would 
have to think twice or three times about at
that price).
