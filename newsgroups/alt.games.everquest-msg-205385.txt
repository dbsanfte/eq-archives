Just to update anyone who cares.  I created two new yahoo email addresses 
with all the same options about 10 days ago, I posted once with one of them 
here in this newsgroup, and have not used either of them for anything else 
at all since then.  So far, I have recieved 3 spam emails to the one I used 
for posting, and none to the one I have not used.  I imagine that over 
time, the spam will build up, it usually does, but it does appear that 
email addresses do indeed get snagged from this ng in particular.
