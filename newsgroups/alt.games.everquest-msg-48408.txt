 What do level 50s need with 1pp drops?
 
 I just walked in to see what all the hubbub was all about and
nearly got wasted before I could get back out. This was when I 
was about level 52 or so and I used an entire bar of mana casting
the biggest PBs and AEs I had at the time before I realised I 
better get the hell out of there. VI quickly put the zone back 
the way it was, I think they realized they kinda screwed the 
pooch on that one.
 
 Level 60s were dying in there for cripes sake...
