My personal experience would go further and say only dark blue mobs can
give you skillups. I shot about 300 arrows into a light blue and got no
skillups at all. I shot 40 into a dark blue and immediately got 2, now
the random number generator in EQ sometimes does screwy stuff, but I have
yet to hear from anyone who's had skillups on light blues.
