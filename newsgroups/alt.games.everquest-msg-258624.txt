I mean something similar but subtly different: not that the quest should 
be soloable by a member of the class its for, at the level where the 
item is interesting, but rather that doing the quest should require or 
at least benefit from having that person along.

Paladin quests should involve undead or casters, and should -not- 
involve unstunnable mobs or undead that are nonetheless immune to anti 
undead procs.

Wizard quests should involve tons of porting around and mobs with low hp 
but very high melee output, so that killing them by burning them to the 
ground -fast- is the best answer.   They should not involve mobs that 
are immune to magic, so that the wizard becomes nothing but baggage.

Berserker mobs should be snareable but run at SOW speeds unsnared, 
should not only be stunnable but should be either casters with nasty 
spells which should be stopped, or should have very high melee output so 
that adding stun "slow" to a real slow is a very good idea; then they 
should be particularly vulnerable to Berzerk stuns.

Druid quest mobs should come in packs of 4

You can think of dozens of examples.

But my point is, I'm willing to accept that very often a group or at 
least a partner with complementary skills/abilities should be required 
to take down that mob or do that quest; SOE/Verant likes groups, and 
group content makes sense to me even when its about quested items for a 
single class; everyone cooperate and help each otehr get their quests 
done.  Thats fine.

What irritates me is that in this case, substituting pretty much any 
other class for the berserker in the group would improve the group; if I 
can't stun and snare, then I'm just a rogue with a very bad backstab and 
no ability to evade.  I see this far too often... and for Zerker's, I 
fear its just the tip of the iceberg, at the higher end of the game and 
on raids I'm thinking that this won't be true just of quest mobs, but of 
most raid targets and even of most xp targets.

I was in a group in POI yesterday with a warrior MT, and I had to 
curtail my stunning and snaring simply to allow him to keep aggro. 
Well, again, if I can't stun then you've taken away a very large part of 
what I can contribute to a group, which is damage reduction.  Other 
classes complain about this effect too in the higher end game; they get 
stripped of a big chunk of their utility and go from highly useful to 
the margins of desirability.
