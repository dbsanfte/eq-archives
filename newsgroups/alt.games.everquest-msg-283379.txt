 Ack. You got me on that one. Or should I say I got myself. I should

 Only time I've used it is with my necro in Rathe. Sit on drog, invis,
sic pet on HG. loot corpse, invise, repeat. I can't remeber ever using
it on a charmed mob with my enchanter but I *think* it breaks the
charm. And then the mob breaks the enchanter. Hopefully someone else
with a bit more experience  at this with shed some more light on it.
