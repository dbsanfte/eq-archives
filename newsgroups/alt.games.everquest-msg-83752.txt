When I was a young Troll, I fell in love with Najena. It was a place
where, once you figured out the patterns of the zone, my friends and I
could get some great xp, occasional "Ph4t L3wtz", and had it to
ourselves a lot. Later on, I developed a similar relationship with ToFS.
Then came the Hole, with some of the nicest XP I'd ever seen.

Well, yesterday I may have stepped foot into "The Promised Land". It was
Dragon Necropolis. We went in with a small expeditionary force (two
groups) and worked our way down into some of the tunnels. While the day
ended with a TPW, it was still fantastic. (Hint: The Dragon Constructs
can be a bad idea to pull in a crowded area for a small force. Heh. They
are nearly impossible to root or snare, and when it does stick, it lasts
for, oh...... three microseconds. And when they are low on life, they
run. They run FAST. And generally right into about 12 angry rats.)

Things I like about this zone:
1. Pretty empty. Reports from higher level friends indicated this, and
indeed, our raid force was the only people in there except for four lvl
sixties who were working a different area.

2. Plentiful mobs, but not so packed that you are constantly swarmed.

3. No greens at all to the mid fifties crowd. Everything there is full
blue to red. No cleaning out greenies to get to an xp giving area.

4. Fun and Exciting! The mobs there play tricks on you I'd not run into
before. The Phase Spiders constantly shadow step people all over the
room and you then have to run back to the fight once you figure out
where you are. The traps in there are really surprising the first time.
Walking along, all clear, suddenly you are swarmed with tiny beetles.
VERY tiny, in fact. Hard to see, target, and get a group on. Yet
strangely, for such tiny things, they can kill a post fifty caster in
almost no time. ;-)

5. The loot. Ahhhhhhhhh, the loot. What can I say? Spectacular. We had a
number of Thurg quest gems drop in short order, including four of the
"flawless variety" for the Chest items. (Sadly, no diamonds for the
warrior class types, but the casters were pretty happy, I can tell you.)
The weapons were simply beautiful. We had a 2HS with stats, 30/40 drop
almost immediately in the tunnels, and a velium war lance (2HP, nearly
as good damage ratio) shortly thereafter. The loot here rocks.

6. The layout, design and graphics.  This zone is haunting and
beautiful. The giant skeletons of long dead dragons litter the halls,
the ceilings are so high that even a Troll or Ogre never feels
claustrophobic. (In fact, I felt like a dorf!) and it's simply a
beautiful design.

7. The Drew Carrey Show. (If you've never seen the show, this will make
no sense at all.) But for some reason, the rest of the day I had a song
running through my head: 
"All the cleric chicks,
With their clicky sticks, say
DN ROCKS
DN ROCKS!
DN ROCKS!!!!!!!"

:-)
