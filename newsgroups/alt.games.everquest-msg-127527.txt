Check the manual for a full list of "ALT+" commands.

Most of the comments I have raed from the developers seem to point to
putting players into "Total immersion", so I guess that explains the logic
with ALT+TAB. As lame as that is, until they decide to remove it EQWindows
is about the only way around this.

The hacking aspect of ALT+TAB is bogus. You could "wrap" the program is
kinds of things, not to mention capture the packet stream and do what you
wish to it. More than likely it would involve a second computer where you
could harness the whole CPU instead of the 5% EQ leaves for the OS to
function.
