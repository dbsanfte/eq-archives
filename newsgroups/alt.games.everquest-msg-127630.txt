It is not possible to prove that there is no God.  One can always argue that
God created things the way they are, and it is impossible to provide proof
that this is not the case.  For all I know, God created everything while I
was typing this, prove he didn't.  Maybe he created everything while you are
reading this.  Maybe the whole universe is just a dream I am having, and I'm
going to wake up in a few minutes, prove that it isn't.
