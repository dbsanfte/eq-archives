Thinking about it it seemed like the damage was better with a poison
weapon... I have a scorpialis (4/25 +2 poison) on my vah shir bard and
it seemed like it would consistantly do more average damage than a 6/-
weapon.  Like the 2 from the poison was almost always counted, and the
damage rolled normally for 4 from the weapon.  If you play D&D I'd
compare it to 4/25 = D8 + STR mod up to a max of 8 (higher as the caps
are increased), + 4 poison with a really nasty save.  Obviously that's a
rough estimate, but it seemed to fairly consistently give higher
numbers.

Again block of salt and all that, just anecdotal, no logs.
