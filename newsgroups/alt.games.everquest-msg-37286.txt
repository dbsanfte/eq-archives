In Skyshrine Sentry Kale wants you to pick up some Velium in the Dwarven
mines. Take the note he gives you and 50 pp to a dwarf in the mines under
thurgadin. He will then give you a velium shipment to return to Kale. Give
it to Kale and he will occasionally reward you with a bracer of hammerfall.
The tough part of this quest is building faction with CoV.
