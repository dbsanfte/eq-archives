LOL! I just figured that since all the spell areas had a point in them already,
channeling did also. Then when I was back to Surefall to train in cooking, I
noticed my channeling training was still gonna cost me zip copper.

DOH!

1 point into cooking, 1 into channeling. Left me only 58 lessons to spare....

Interesting note tho, event tho I learned the "basics of channeling", the first
message I can recall seeing right after that was that my channeling skill and
increased, and was then at 18. And, it was in the first melee I had right after
training. Is it possible the game placed me at 16 channeling because I was at
16 skill?  I figure maybe I missed a message, as it was combat, but I had cast
at absolute most three spells between learning and the message for 18. 

I mean, I have no idea why it took me to 18 so fast, other than it felt pity on
me.

That sucks! But...

Actually, my first character was a ranger. I put everything I had into Dex....

That character was level 14 when I discovered the error of my ways, and
hibernated the toon.
