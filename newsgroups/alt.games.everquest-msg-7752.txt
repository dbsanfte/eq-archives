Ok, maybe this will sound condescending, but it isn't, because I had this
problem for the fist 3 weeks of playing EQ.

I had no idea that you could go full screen!  And apparantly some people
newer to the game didn't know it either.  We skipped those parts of the
manual to get to the good stuff :-)  Press F10 and see if that works.  And
make sure that you have in your options set so that you don't change
resolution when switching screens.  I had the same problem and this fixed it
for me.
