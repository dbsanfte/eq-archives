I do equip the thing for major kills, but its the extra HP that
really makes me do it.  With a mod 2 mage source, I'd strip off
wis and mana gear for more HP!  Mana regen is the key, and
there's no better mana source in the game (well manastone but
I sure don't have one, don't think MT has them at all, its a relatively
young server)

Yep there you go, HP, HP, HP

Ethereal Light?  What on earth for?  No, really, I'm not saying
you are wrong, just asking to be shown the error of my ways.
At 4.5 cast time and what, 532 mana, I can't see relying on channeling
it, and if I'm going to back off and let pet die anyway, I might as well
CHeal myself, cheaper and more effective.

I've got EL in the back pages of my spell book, wondering what
the Brell I'll ever come up with that will make this spell make
sense as a heal.

And thats not counting the procs, which often seem to do more damage
than the weapon itself, even when its the post nerf proc rate.  I really
look forward to the 60 summon, since I'm using the pathetic 56 one
at the moment.

(trying to get how this isn't real melee)
