specialization works. What group is the most useful for druids?

Specialization helps reduce fizzles in the field you've specialized in and
helps conserve mana, should there be a successful skill check.

There are three main choices for Druids, and which one you pick depends on
your style of play.

Alteration: Easily the best for a grouping Druid. This controls your heals,
Roots, Snares, Regens, and evacs/ports. (Surely, there must be some I've
missed.)

Conjuration: Conjuration is only good if you plan on soloing your entire
life. In order for this to be useful, you need to use your Magic based DOTs.

Evocation: Evocation is my personal favourite. It allows a little more
flexibility than the other two fields I listed. In groups, you'll probably
find yourself nuking anyhow, and of course when soloing you can always fall
back on your Evocation Specialization and nuke things.

And now, the bad choices...

Abjuration: I can't see any reason to specialize in Abjuration... at all.
Even if your character becomes a PL mule Alteration would still be better.

Divination: ...Once again, -no- reason to specialize in that field. In fact,
if I ever heard of anyone intentionally specializing in this field, I think
I would have them beaten with a curtain rod. <Joking>
