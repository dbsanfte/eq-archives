How's your sense heading and do you use /loc??  Here's how I got good at using
/loc:
Print a map at eqatlas.com, I suggest Hollowshade Moor since that's how you get
to Paludal.    The grid on the right side of the map running vertical is the
first number you see when you type /loc.  the numbers running parallel along
the top of the map is the second number you see when you do a /loc.
The zone line for Shar Vahl is positive 1233 pos 2787.  If you run out the city
gates and go directly south towards Paludal you will notice the first number
will start going down until it hits zero, then starts going into the negatives.
 The second number will stay pretty much the same.   The zone line to Paludal
is at negative 1827 pos 2858.  Practice this in a safe zone !!! (like
Knowledge) with the appropriate map to get a feel for how to use /loc.  Each
map has it's own scale, but north is always at the top, south at the bottom,
east on the right, west on the left, (as you are looking at the map).
I have a hotkey set up for both /loc and sense heading, and I use them all the
time.
It amazes me to have a level 50 run up to me who isn't able to find their way
to the zoneline because they never learned how to sense direction and use /loc.
