Haven't seen the helm but there appear to be some pieces with chain
graphics (boots) and some with plate (gloves). Drops appear to be
scattered, not all drop in the Nobles area.

You might be able to duo there at 62+ but it would be pushing it, I
(63 shaman)  can duo nobles pretty comfortable with a 65 SK partner
but he's got pretty good gear and over 100AAs. You have to be able to
deal with lvl 63 mobs that hit for over 450 and harmtouch for 1k.
Everything there summons and don't expect much help from the shaman
for DPS since the mobs are immune to poison and disease. Nasties mob
we saw in the area was a named that quads for 700. 

Drop me an e-mail at NOSPAM@compuserve.com, just replace the NOSPAM
with 'fegerter' if you want some more info on that part of Veksar. I'm
not really willing to tell the world all about it atm, ... for ummm,
monetary reasons <g>.
