what about the murder of 1000+ palestinians under isreali oppression that
happened FIRST?!
the killing of innocent people is wrong no matter how many people it is, but
you mention the deaths of about 100 isrealis and NOT  the deaths of 10 times
many more palestinians!

my source?  Amnesty International.. and don't tell me they're a human-rights
activist group.. is basic human rights too much to ask for?!
www.amnesty.org

please put the blind pride aside.
