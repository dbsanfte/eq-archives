Its very rare that there's more than one cleric in a group.  Nonetheless,
heal and buff is not the only effective style of play; particularly in
small groups (duo, trio) you may find other plans much more effective..
or you may find them marginally less effective but far more fun, and
one of the best things about playing duo or even solo is that you don't
get as much pressure to do the most optimal thing.

In a large group, you usually have someone else to do stuns, crowd
control, pulling, and so forth, so everyone gets more channeled into
their area of expertise.
