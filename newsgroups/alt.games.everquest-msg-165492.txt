   *Raises Eyebrow* I dunno, it doesn't seem to me like Helen been
hanging around all that much.

   I read the responses, and it does seem to me that they might be right
about this being a troll, albeit a good one.  Something just doesn't
ring right.  Why are the follow-ups set to another newsgroup, rather
than this one?  "Helen" can't figure out how to contact a guys ISP, but
she has no problem at all doing this?  And I can't help but think that
if she told her local law enforcement that she was getting naked emails
from a guy that hopes her 12 year old gets them, they might be a bit
more interested in her plight.  Hell, they would most likely have one of
there 44 year old agents come up with a screen name like "BitchenKitten"
and see if they could lure him into a prison term.

Too bad.  Some people really do have this sort of problem.  Using this
situation as troll bait is pretty juvenile.
