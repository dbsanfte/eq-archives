Yeah, but it still seriously sucks right now.  I keep my research skill
maxxed, and as of level 20 or 21, the level 16 spells were still not trivial
to make.  The chance of failure when making these spells from these very
hard to obtain (at least the specific ones you happen to need) items, is way
to high.
