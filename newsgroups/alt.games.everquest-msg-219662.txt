Excuse me ? WTF planet are you living on?
In case you might have misunderstood me...Bullshit.

Things are not as bad as last year and that was better than the year
before. We have been though a downturn, a major terrorist attack which
hit the financial community VERY hard, 2 wars and constant democrat
sabotage AND STILL THINGS IMPROVE. American jobs have been going to
India since the mid 90s that's not exactly new. Although GW was not my
first choice he has proved worthy of the office unlike the last piece
of crap euro-soicialist we had in there.
