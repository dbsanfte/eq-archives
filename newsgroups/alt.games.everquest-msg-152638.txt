I just give Jazz a blankey and shut the lights off, and go play EQ. The cats
all snuggle around him, and he actually looks adorable that way.

The only time he gets upset over being left this way is when the cats argue
over who sleeps where. That wakes him very quickly. Once, a claw got into
his eye and he was in serious pain and couldn't see right for a week. He
didn't fall asleep on the couch for at least a month after that.

So you may want to cut out the adorable part and just throw a cat on his
head.
