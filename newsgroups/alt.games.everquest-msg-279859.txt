MT tanks.  If there are additional mobs that need to be killed *while* a
main mob is being tanked, an MA will be the one who calls assists.  Doesn't
necessarily involve any tanking.  My guild often uses a wizard as MA on one
particular encounter for instance.

I'll give you a couple hints from a longtime raid leader and raid puller:

A) Do it faster.  Trust me.  Only applies to a tanking MA.  I'm not saying
call it instantly, I'm saying acquire aggro instantly and call it when
you're ready.  When you think you have this accomplished, move on to hint B.

B) Do it faster.  Trust me.

C) Be spatially aware.  Casters need line of sight to cast, so move out of
line of sight to stop a chain caster's nuking and get it to come on into
camp.  As well, you need line of sight to acquire aggro, so make sure you've
got room in front of camp or you're gonna be swimming through your own raid
force to get to a mob.

D) Be aware of game mechanics.  Kill the gater first.  When a gater has
friends around, he won't gate.  If he's alone, he's gonna try...

A good MA can do much to make sure a raid goes smoothly.  A bad MA can
guarantee failure.  Slackers don't make good MA's.
