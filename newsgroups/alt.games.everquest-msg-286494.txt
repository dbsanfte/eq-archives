Who cares about SoE and what they do?  All irrelevant, I played since 2002
on and off and dont give a crap what they do really (not that I wont moan a
bit about ogm my class needs this, etc, but it's not like it's gonna stop me
playing), and seen people who have played even longer, do nothing but
complain about SoE and how they hate us all etc and how the game is so bad
yadayadayada.  But they continue to play it, and, somehow manage to have
fun.............

There is no win for SoE, patch, people complain, dont patch, people
complain, 6 hours is not exactly a long time, to not be able to play A GAME,
for christ sake.

Even if you dont know, you try and log in 'oh nos I cant log in' and it
tells you it's patching, finding out the current patch info is not rocket
science.

If you aint having fun, fuck off to World of Holdyourhand.

Hmm, 2am pointless rants win!!

(not pointed at you btw D.J, just  a general rant).
