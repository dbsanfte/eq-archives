Actually verant has expressed regret at not having them matter more,
or so I remember.
Basically they said they can't be changed at this time and unlike the
Voodoo Math (tm) stuff they can do with the xp table and multiplying
the xp you get instead of changing the table, they can't do much about
stats at this point. They also mentioned them being that way so
twinking does not do that much. 

I think they originally set out TO have an ogre be an obviously
supreme warrior but then somehow their stats were not given enough
oomph to make much of a difference.

AH found the quote on twinking:

STATS EXPLAINED, APRIL 9, 2000

"... We will not, however, engage in debate and our stance on how much
some stats affect game play is that it's by design to inhibit some
aspects of twinking. Are there better attribute systems out there?
Yeah, but we're not going to change something as fundamental as a stat
system in EQ after the game's been out for more than a year. "

brad mcquaid, in a message explaing what stats do and about them
changing.

Hmm that sounds a bit like a catch 22 to me. Having stats not do a lot
is to inhibit some aspects of twinking... so.... even a non twinked
level appropriate person in great stat gear is not doing that hot
because the impact of stats are lessened to inhibit some aspects of
twinking. Catch 22!  It would have been better if they instead, at
creation, made stats REALLY matter so an ogre warrior with 140 str and
150 sta was just a god like damage dealer and receiver then just make
it so gear did not have many stats on it which changed that..
nullifying twinking stats.
