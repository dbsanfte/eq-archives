}Taellaar's an agnostic DE rogue, Ryou is an Innoruuk worshipping DE

}him and I told him no way jose - don't mind them looking at me askance
}but that's as far as I'm going for now.  Of course then, after looking

}mentioned coming all the way there to kill, he asked if I needed the
}one I had on... 9_9
}I've found the best place to hunt this little girl is by going into

}BL trainers - there's a big open room with three sellers on one side
}and three sellers on another, and just before that quite a few stairs
}- I sit at the bottom of the stairs and keep an eye on the screen
}while reading a book.  She's a fairly fast pop, don't think I waited
}more'n ten or fifteen minutes for her either time.  There's some
}argument as to whether the guards will aggro if you attack her, so I
}just played it safe and waited until she was alone.  She only takes
}about 2 seconds to kill.

Oh... I think I might know what to do... level 1 uberbuffed kittie to take 
the hits. :) I'll report back if I actually do it. :)  Good tip about the 
pull spot though, thanks.
