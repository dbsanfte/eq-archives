heheh life... yeah I got one of those.... I am out 4-5 hours a night playing
pool in a couple of leagues around the city I live in... off to the movies
just about every friday night... and saturday is bar night..... I just don't
sleep... never have..... I think in the past 10 years I have gotten about
1-2 hours a sleep a night... anymore and I cannot function.
