At higher levls (not the highest levels) some enchanters will use AE mezzes,
which will mez all mobs in the nearby vacinity (not really a good tactic for
most high end chanters)

Generally the chanter will pick mobs with full HP and keep them mezzed.. you
should be able to see which mob is being beaten on (and you can certainly
see their hp going down, if you target the wrong mob)

Also rather than manuevering around, most chanters I know will change into
overhead view (or pan out) to target the other mobs.

<-- not really a chanter expert, never played a chanter over level 54
