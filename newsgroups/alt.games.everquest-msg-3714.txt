Drakkal Icegrinder.  Got it about 4 days after SOV was
released, while killing Frost giants in GD.  Never heard of
the thing, wasn't common knowledge at the time, we thought
that the Drakkal forged sledgehammer was the rare drop
off of them.

When it dropped, I looked at it real close and decided to
drop about 100 practice points into 2hb.  Amazing, I
was melee capable again like I hadn't been since I was
20th or so.  IIRC, its 27/45... something ludicrous like
that anyway.

It was a couple levels after that, though, that someone
showed me the bounce (a druid friend, to be exact)

At those levels, we were doing a lot of snare/fear work,
so mana and heals weren't much of an issue, and a
cleric that can fear and then contribute melee damage
is real handy.

Still, at 10 thru 14 so far (ding) I've been doing max of 19
pretty regular with my little runed totem staff.  My understanding
is that damage is capped till I hit 20 anyway, so I haven't
put the effort into finding a higher damage output toy.
Lets think Hammer of Flattening, perhaps, as an inexpensive
next step up?  High delay weapons tend to go for relatively
little money since real tanks get a bonus per strike that makes
small and fast work better.  Healers don't get that, so the
key is ratio, and with -this- trick the key is longest delay
possible in a given ratio bracket.

PS with that melee damage on the icegrinder, by the way,
I wasn't counting the Ice Rend proc, which went off
three or four times a fight.  Unfortunately in EW, GD, and
Iceclad, it was resisted more often than not.  Had some fun
with it in Sky though.
