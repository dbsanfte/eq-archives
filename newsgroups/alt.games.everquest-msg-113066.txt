Nah - they don't just target Yanks, they target anyone from "relatively"
wealthy countries and generally send out a flood of email/phone calls in the
hope the odd fool replies. Their line is always geared around the victims
greed of some form or another so I never feel sorry for the punters scammed.
We get quite a few of them here in Australia even, mostly share orientated
scams based out of Thailand recently. It is normally quite an international
operation as well as they try to employ as many US/Pommy/Aust/European
expats as possible for use in the following up and deal closing (it
disguises where the operation is based). They usually only use the cheap
local labour for cold calling to find the leads for the expats to follow up
on.

There is no use venting anger at the poor miserable sod doing the cold
calling, he/she is problerly getting paid an absolute pittance to get
verbally abused 12 hours a day without even knowing what the company is
actually doing. Save your anger/abuse for our fellow countrymen who are the
ones making the obscene amounts of money doing the followups knowing full
well exactly what they are doing.
