Damn....   I could have sworn the part about him being of the house of the
Steward wasn't until the third book....  It's been way to long since I read
that series.  I may have to pick it up again, once I'm done with Atlas
Shrugged.  Stupid Ayn Rand, makes me think way too much.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
