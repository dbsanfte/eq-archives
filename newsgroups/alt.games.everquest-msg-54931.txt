Wow, AO is playable?  Last I heard it was barely beta-quality.  In either
case it kinda hurts your case to compare EQ with AO. :)

As to the EQ economy it has ALWAYS sucked.  For more than 2.5 years it has
sucked.  It doesn't help your case at all to imply that it's suddenly worse
when it clearly is not.

EQ has never had a KS problem.  Yup, it happens on occasion but it's never
been a problem.  Strike 3 for you.

GMs have always done what they could.  Yup, sometimes the answer was "no."
I tend to doubt if your legitimate petitions were actually legitimate.
Strike 4.

DAOC has no GM-led anythings.  Hell, I don't think I've SEEN a GM.  Hell, I
don't think the GMs have seen the GMs....they're so busy with 10k+ petitions
in their queue that they haven't done anything at all to make the game more
fun for players.   The guild to which my best friend belongs accidentally
picked the wrong guild emblem (something I really wish EQ had, though I'd
setting for CLOAKS :) ) because of a confusing interface.  They /appealed
(petitioned) and it took over 2 days for a GM to get back to him (the
problem was solved to everyone's satisfaction).

AO, from most accounts, SUCKS right now.
DAOC is not immersive enough.  Quests are way too easy and take no time at
all to do.  Creature comforts that we take for granted in EQ are not yet in
DAOC (though there's hope they will be).  It's a HELL of a lot easier to be
a jerk in DAOC than EQ...experience leeches.  Anyone who interacts with
either the critter (taking a swing & running away) or even heals the
combatant when neither asked for nor desired and whether grouped or not,
will get a chunk of the experience.  Yeah, I hear it's against the
rules...big deal.  It's not like the GMs are going to do anything about it
for quite a while.
