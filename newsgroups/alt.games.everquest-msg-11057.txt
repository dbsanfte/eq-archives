Then you didn't play your Paladin long enough.  Paladins also get
Double Attack and Disarm.

Furthermore, it may be appropriate to dismiss the level 9 Paladin
spells as "a few spells", but if you had gotten far enough along
to get Root and some other highly effective spells, I'm certain
you wouldn't be as indifferent about missing them on your Warrior.
