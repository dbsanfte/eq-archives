It is possible to be killed whilst camping the tracks nowhere near a zoneline.

My take on this is simple: 1> if you camp the tracks, you'll get run over by a train, 2>
why shouldn't an angry MOB take up a beef with the PCs highest on it's hate list?  If the
person who originally angered the MOB is out of range, perhaps that beastie will turn on
you out of pique or self-defense.

>d) My main reason. The sheer rudeness, ignorance and greed of the players.

/ignore /petition /live with it
