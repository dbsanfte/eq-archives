I'm using an LDoN model primarly because it can be applied across the 
largest differences of levels. You can LDoN from 15-70.
Once again though I agree there are exceptions. Besides a lot of zones are 
like LDoN in content, in the aspect,generally when you take a camp, you know 
what to expect from the camp, When you enter a zone, you generally know what 
level of mobs are in the zone, and will stick to the ones you know you can 
handle.

Bards get calm from level 8 I believe, I have found very few if any zones 
that a decent bard can't pull singles in. As for aggro control, there's 
ton's of it. Besides, except in the case of summoning mobs (once again a 
limited exception included towards the endgame and not majority of players) 
anyone of the party members as opposed to the pets would be fine but 
generally of the 4 classes, the necro is the most likely to get aggro, and 
that's why he has FD, if the bard gets aggro, he can start slowing and 
circle the mob while the pets continue to chew the mob up and save the 
cleric some mana, if the cleric gets aggro they can DA if it's bad, 
otherwise heal themself while the casters have a nuke party once again, 
things that can be applied even though the group's average may be 15 or 50+. 
Generally though once you've grouped once or twice, you'll figure out when 
to throw that nuke, or stick that dot on a mob to prevent aggro.. and that 
is REAL aggro control...


> Especially not the interesting parts ;)

You know, at one point in the game, every zone was interesting. That disco 
room in seb is still cool to me, the waterfall in Stonebrunt mountain with 
watereffects may not give me experience or loot, but it gives me a better 
appreciation of the time and effort spent on creating this world for us. So 
even though you may feel all the interesting parts of EQ must be contained 
within the same zone as Uberweapon drop or some 1500quadding mob, I believe 
there is more to the game than loot and looks.
