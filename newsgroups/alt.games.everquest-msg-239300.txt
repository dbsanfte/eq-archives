Just to clarify on this, for people who think I make shit up as I go.

Even win2k (and up) and probably even the older NT models, could restart on
crash(SOMEtimes it freezes, and wont restart, but BSOD's do a memory dump
and then reboot), and in order to relaunch programs all you'd have to do is
either put them in startup (or run, in regedit) or run them as a service and
then give them a config file on what to do once they start.

linux/unix does the same thing.


and as far as the paging goes. 2way text pagers have email addresses. all
the machine has to do is send an email to your pagers address and presto.
