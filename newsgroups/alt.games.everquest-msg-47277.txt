my advice is this: reset your computer. i dunno why, but for some reason if i
reset my computer enough times, it works. i had a problem a few months ago with
the everquest game just turnin black, and then goin back to windows, and then
some blue screen would come up with errors or somethin and i would reset it,
and it would either work, or id have to reset it a few more times or something.
 but. i dunno if your computer is like mine or not. anway my advice
