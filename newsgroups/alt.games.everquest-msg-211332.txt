Of course.  And, given that there are many Christians who suspect
strongly that our minds were given to us for far more interesting
work than blind obedience, we proceed naturally to...

We'll still be here when the self-proclaimed "fundamentalists" have
faded into the dust.  Patiently teaching one another and any others
willing to learn the fundamental lessons of humility, love, and
forgiveness that Jesus taught.  We humans are a contentious and
self-interested lot, saints ala Mother Theresa are exceedingly rare,
so even having accepted Christ's example we need regular reminders.

We do speak up.  However, unlike the shouters we are not obsessed with
forcing our views upon others.  If our beliefs are correct then they
will prevail in the end regardless of all the din and clamor of the
self-righteous.

Agreed.  Though as their pretense often goes no further than proclaiming
themselves to be "Christian", it's rather sad that most media takes them
at their word.
