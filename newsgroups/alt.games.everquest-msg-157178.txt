No Verant Interactive made boats 3+ years ago. Since then the game has
had 4 (as of PoP) expansions and you would not be wrong in saying that
it is a completely different game than it was the day it launched. EQ
is constantly evolving.

My guess is that Sony/Verant realized that more people too ports
(Nexus or Player) than boats. So with PoP they give the players what
they want, which is quicker travel.

You would have to be crazy to believe that they forced players to take
boats (or pay other players for ports) for 3+ years just to cash in on
an expansion.
