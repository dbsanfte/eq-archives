Ok, most SK haste items seem to be drops of dragons etc .. of no use
to a normal person within a normal group and a bad guild :)

So far I found the more or less only items I could possibly get
are:

- FBSS  
  easiest but don't want it ... no AC, not good for a tank

- Swirlspine belt
  Nice, but all this kedge endure breath stuff gives me the
  creeps. And the mobs aren't random, seems like it's off
  two guardians near the top mpb there .. 

- Silver chitin handwraps
  Seems to be doable by a group of 55's or so ... but then again
  it has only 5 AC on a gauntlet item .. low for a tank.

- Runebranded girlde
  Excellent thing. AC, haste and stats. Seems to drop of various things
  in Old Sebilis.

- Siblisian berserker cloak
  Excellent. Loads of stats, haste and acceptable 9 AC for a Back
  item. There's confusion .. some mention Trakanon .. some say
  it drops off other things in Old Sebilis?


Allakhazams lists the drops differing from what the postings below it
say. Anyone have any experience?
