This isn't a damn apartment building, it's on and off sequences
activated by magnetics. It doesn't take shit to hold on to your
information so they should keep it as long as the game exists. I
sincerely hope in the future that is what MMORPGs advertize as a
feature because I'm really sick of it. Stupid ass metaphors have no
place when referring to storage on information, they have enough room
to hold it all and the fact is the size of the character files aren't
getting much bigger but HD spaces are growing by size at an insane
rate now and getting cheaper and cheaper. It's stupid, if they don't
quit it they don't exist anymore, simple as that.

PS- I'm officially sick of Verant ass kissers, if you want to have gay
sex talk to that strange old uncle that always looks at you funny.
