2hr???  2 Handed Reaming?

Anyways, don't worry about slow unless you're main-tanking.  Remember,
slower weapons have a higher damage bonus, and allow some of your longer
spells to get off without pushing your next hit too far out.  People put way
too much emphasis on slow.

Well, for one thing, you're not getting the effect of the fbss if you're
using a mithryl zweihander.
