Population in PoK at european peak time (10 am)
is  around the same as in 2002,around 150.
On the other hand there are less traders than
usual in Bazaar the last weeks,often there are 
less than 400 traders,I remember having difficulties
to find a free spot for my trader,even when they
raised the maximum limit to 550.Never had this 
happen in the last weeks.

I still enjoy EQ,but I am fed up with throwing out
new expansions,while years-old bugs are not 
fixed.I can imagine that some people quit for that
reason,myself I will quit ,when OoW goes live and
there are still mobs under the surface,this was 
introduced with Luclin.
I dont expect them to balance the classes perfectly
or retune old zones with every new expansion,but
real bugs should be fixed before another expansion.
