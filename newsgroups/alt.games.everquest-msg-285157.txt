Why not?  It seems reasonably consistent with the data we can publicly 
gather.  For example, if I'm counting right, there are 178 servers, with 
servers reasonably crowded.  Figure an average of 2000 players per 
server (trying to be conservative here), and that's 350k online at the 
same time.  That's quite consistent with a 7 million subscribers.
