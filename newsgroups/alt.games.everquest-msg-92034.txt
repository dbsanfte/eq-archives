Alternet is one of the many former names of UUNet, which is the largest 
backbone ISP in the US.  They have the most bandwidth, the most customers, 
and the most traffic.  They are also one of Sony's main ISPs.

Well, this doesn't mean that there is a problem with Alternet, though it 
does indicate that there may be a problem with the peering between 
Telestra and Alternet.  The real issue is that there are several other 
ISPs in the route between Telestra and Alternet.  It *appears* that 
Telestra hands off to reach.com, but I suspect that what I'm seeing is 
Telestra being sloppy with their reverse-DNS, though the next hand-off is 
to Hong Kong Telecom (in the US it appears), which then carries the 
traffic to Palo Alto, California to hand off to Alternet.  It then hits a 
couple Alternet routers in Palo Alto, goes to Sacramento, then to LA, and 
finally to San Diego.  Those 8 hops in California with Alternet probably 
add on the order of less than 1ms of latency other than speed of light 
through fiber delay (in other words the latency is less than 1ms greater 
than if there was a direct fiber connection between Palo Alto and San 
Diego).  I suspect that every one of those links is at least OC-12 
(622Mbit/sec).  
If Alternet was having problems with their network, a large number of US 
players would be seeing similar problems, as Palo Alto is a huge traffic 
exchange point for Alternet (and other US ISPs).  I suspect the HKT part 
may be the problem, especially the backchannel (US to Australia).

There is very little significant difference in your second traceroute.  
Optus hands off to Cable & Wireless (part owner of HKT, but completely 
seperate IP backbones), who hands off to AT&T, who hands off to Sony.  
You get to the US a bit more directly, but within the US you have very, 
very similiar performance based on these traceroutes.  
Hop counts are NOT an indication of network performance, and have not been 
for 5 years or so.  It is absolutely trivial to hide hop counts, and when 
people acutally thought that hop counts mattered, many ISPs did.  The only 
real result was that it was much harder to pinpoint problems since all you 
saw from outside was a link from NYC to LA, you didn't see the 17 ATM 
switches the link passed through, any one of which could be the culprit.  
Of course now they just use MPLS tunnels, since ATM is telco, old, and 
stupid.
One thing you might try doing is pinging the hops along the way and seeing 
if you see a significant increase in packetloss at any specific hop.  A 
caveat though:  ICMP (pings and the like) directed at a router is 
generally handled with the lowest priority by routers, so that a lot of 
pings won't slow down the routing functionality.  You won't be able to do 
much with this, other than maybe send it to your ISP, but at least you 
have a chance of figuring out where the problem lies.
