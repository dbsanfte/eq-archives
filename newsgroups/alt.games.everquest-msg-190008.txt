At lower levels, I like Druids.  At mid-higher levels, I like a magician.
As long as you do more damage than the magician plus his current pet, you
get full xps.  Magician engages mob with DS'ed pet, person being PL'ed adds
damage from whatever source, whether it's melee or spell.  Towards the end
of the fight, magician reclaims pet, then sends another in to finish the
monster off.  The magician can even nuke *discriminately* as the PLee finds
his way to higher levels - as long as the person being PL'ed does more
damage than the mage plus the current pet at the end of the fight.  This
won't work with a warrior, but it will work with a melee class that can heal
itself or a class that inflicts damage with spells.

I've read that enchanters can do a good PLing trick - beat the mob down,
then memblur to erase its memory, then let the PLee finish it off for full
experience.
