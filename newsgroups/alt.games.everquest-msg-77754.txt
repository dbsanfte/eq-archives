If you plan to go to the end game with them, start a cleric/chanter
combo. You'll *never* have a hard time finding pickup tanks in your
early levels and you'll be invited into good guilds, should you wish,
when you make it up to the fifites. In the low levels, the two of you
could even go it alone in many zones if you play it right.
