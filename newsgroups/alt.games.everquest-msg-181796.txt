Most of these situations where someone asks for a buff or service of
someone who cannot provide it involve a true newbie.  I think the most
laughable examples of stupidity, which sometimes also really piss you
off, are those where 40, 50, or 60 level characters make stupid
mistakes.  (To the point that you *have* to conclude "Ebay".)

-----
"What is evac?"  -asked by a high level druid as the party died. 
(Heard about that one)
-----
40 cleric: "...I can rez him from anywhere.  Incoming rez."  (Or
something like that.
Me: "Do NOT accept that rez."
Dead paladin: "Why not?"
Me: "We haven't dragged your corpse to a safe spot.  You are
surrounded by MOBs."
40 cleric: "Why didn't you say so before I cast?"
-----
And why is it that so many of those people who really tend to anger
everyone are monks?  The really stupid ones who pull train after
train, beg for a rez, train again trying for the corpse.  Kill some
more people.  Beg for a rez.  Maybe get the corpse to zoneline this
time but stand up when they are still in the 're-aggro range', bring a
few hundred spiders to the zoneline.  Feign and watch everyone else
die...continue begging for rezzes.

Maybe it's because of that skill, FD.  But it seems like every 2 or 3
numbskulls out there has an iksar monk...

Shaman and cleric: "LOM"
Level 44 iksar monk who shouldn't be in KC at all and is *not* the
assigned puller: "Incoming"
(The party barely survives)
Shaman and cleric: "OOM, hold pulls"
Level 44 idiot: "Incoming"

I just keep a little list on my desk here, where I write down the name
of people with whom I will never group again.  I make my own karma.
