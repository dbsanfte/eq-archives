	The problem is that it is TOO easy to sell things.  Anyone who can leave a
character online for a few hours a day can be a merchant, and that means the
full force of EQ's deflationary economy comes into play.  In The Good Old
Days, only dedicated traders would take the time out of levelling and raiding
to go sell things, so there was much less merchandise on the market.  Now,
nearly everything finds its way to the bazaar, and prices fall on the floor
and die.

	This is particularly devastating when it comes to trade skills.  My
character got almost all of his droppable pre-Fear/Hate gear with plat made by
selling fletching products, but there is zero chance of anyone doing that
today.  Part of that is due to mudflation making the older bows worthless, but
even the newer merchandise is problematic because every mook who feels like it
is dumping bows on the market.  Shaped shadewood compound bows are selling on
E'ci for 750 pp, which is a non-sustainable price given the cost and rate of
failure, and nightmarewoods are dropping under 3K now.  (Though for some
reason, the price of most of the components isn't dropping accordingly.  I
think we have a handful of people trying to set up a cartel, which won't
last.)
