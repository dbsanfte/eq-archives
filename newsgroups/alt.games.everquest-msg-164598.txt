Depending on circumstances a Ranger or Paladin can deal with adds
(not sure about SK).  And Monks have an escape option that is
much superior to running.  Survivability is not the issue.  What
castars can do, and melees cannot, is dictate the course of the
battle and do killing damage without sufferring a substantial
counterattack.

I won't claim to know what the original designers thought of
class balance, but calling HP and mana "resources consumed in
combat" does no more to make them equivalent than calling a
feverish child and a blast furnace "hot" makes them equivalent.
A caster uses his mana to prevent loss of melee endurance (HP)
while killing his enemy.  A melee has no such option, with the
exception of certain circumstances in which a Ranger is able to
simulate being a caster.  And I should point out that I do not
class Beastlords as melees, despite them being hybrids capable
of executing damaging melee attacks, because their pet gives
them the primary caster "special" ability (the ability to kill
without sufferring counterattack) any time they have enough
mana (note the magic word) to summon it.

No, the main difference is that a caster will use 0% of their combat
endurance soloing an exp giving mob, an option not available to
melees except on a part-time basis for the Ranger.

"Melee KEI" won't work, IMO, it'd just rush EQ faster and further
into its likely doom of being just another cheesy video game.
I think Dennis hit very close to the mark actually, if you read
my rambling reply to James post in this thread yesterday you'll
see what I think might work for "some game sometime".  I don't
think there's any way to "get there from here" tho (i.e. EQ will
have the melee/caster imbalance problem until the day the shut
down the last server, it's just not a patchable issue, IMO).
