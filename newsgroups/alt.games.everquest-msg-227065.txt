POK into G into POM Into CS
Compare to
POK into CS
Thats just two extra zone lines

You do have to cross GD, but the exit to CS is very close to the 
entrance from GD in POM

Paying for a port involves finding someone to do it, then meeting up 
with them, waiting for them to perhaps get more customers, or even take 
you to two or three other destinations first.

Probably faster to just run it, in all honesty, in fact my bard normally 
ran the Kael route rather than wait for port even when it was guild 
making the run, and still beat everyone to CS more often than not.

Swim out of the middle of a lake, now thats funny stuff, most of the 
time I got ports to CS it was to go to WW and beyond, so "middle of the 
lake" is really "halfway to SG"!

But maybe its just me, after all, I'll run to Gunthak via Paineel stone 
rather than spend a half hour looking for a port to stonebrunt, run to 
Grimling Forest via Shar Val stone rather than spend a half hour looking 
for a port, run to Skyfire via Overthere rather than spend a half hour 
looking for a port... all examples within the past week of people I've 
noticed while shopping for spells or otherwise semi afk in POK for long 
periods of time.

Shortcut to CS?  Sign me up.

Splendid
