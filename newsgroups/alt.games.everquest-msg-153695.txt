RP-wise, sure, it makes sense.

But there's a serious gameplay problem when it gets to the point 
that a single group of wizards can make the rounds after a 
server reset and single-handedly wipe out a dozen or more 
dragons (and other uber-mobs).

The problem is that this one group can totally monopolize
those dragons, preventing any other players from having
a shot at them and their unique loot (which often
includes epic quest items).

Things that make RP sense are fine, but only as long as
they don't seriously screw up gameplay balance.  If they
do, a way must be found to adjust them.
