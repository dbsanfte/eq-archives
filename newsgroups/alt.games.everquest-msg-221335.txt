Are knights not good dps classes though, also making them desirable if 
not merely as SA?

I would think that's as it should be. If you can't find a "premiere" 
tank, go for a decent but obviously lesser second option.

I also like the fact that it gives groups options. However, the knights 
offer much more than just spongability. Therein lies the problem. If they 
are on par with warriors where sponging is concerned (they are currently 
too close to being just that) then the additional utility and incredible 
hate generation they bring to the table makes them usually the better 
choice.

I still like this idea. If the knights can't take the beating a warrior 
can, it becomes an issue. It provides an important role for both class 
types. Naturally, all the casters want to drop nukes fast and furious, 
but if they don't allow the knight to grab aggro and then the warrior to 
taunt off the knight, someone becomes a grease spot. The healers should 
naturally want the warrior to keep aggro as much as possible for more 
efficient healing. If everyone employs tactics and discretion, it should 
work great. After all, should the casters really be able to nuke non-
stop? When I was playing my wizard, I found half the strategy to be in 
timing.

I'm going to defer to your vast experience here, but it seems to me that 
knights being so close to warriors in effectiveness would really only be 
necessary for those groups where people don't play their roles (no pun 
intended) effectively.
