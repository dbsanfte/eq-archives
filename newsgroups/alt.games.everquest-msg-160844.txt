Dunno about the stone, but the wisp essence is for a newb quest of
some kind, dunno which one.  I've had one on my vendor mule at a plat
for months and haven't sold it, so you'll probably be better off
selling them.  Or, if you can find out which quest they're for, be
nice and hand it to someone who needs it  :)  (and tell me, might as
well get rid of it somehow)
