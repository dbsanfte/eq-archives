Didn't see the original reply.
1. Not particularly affected by the changes as I don't play any more, but I
don't see why everyone would get upset.
And I've posted before, I'm just a lurker (and have changed email addresses
recently)
2. Yes, as I said it tells me they are doing something right. Maybe it's not
encouraging grouping, maybe it's not content, maybe it's simply being here
first...  but something.
3. I like to group too.
4. Wow, we agree. Why would you solo on a laggy server with lots of doods
when you can play Final Fantasy solo and have a great time.
5. That does not warrant a response.
