You see?  It's two different worlds.  It's a world for you high-up types who
can probably understand what half the stuff on that screen was, and can say
things like "Looks like his DA was fading.  I hope he was about to zone"...
And then there's the world I live in, where I get things like "Holly
Windstalker slashes YOU for 26 points of damage; You have been slain by
Holly Windstalker; LOADING...."

*sigh*

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
