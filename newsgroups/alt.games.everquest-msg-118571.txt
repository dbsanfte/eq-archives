[Top post fixed]

Yes. Don't have the exact /loc off the top of my head, but the area is
easy to find. Come out of Thur heading south and take a left into the
first ravine heading east. Follow the wall/zone line staying as high up
as you can until you reach the "corner" of the part of the zone. You
have to bear right here (south again) and up a slight slope onto a flat
ledge with a couple of trees. The snow gives way to bare rock in the
corner behind one of these trees.

Unless somebody drags a train up there running to Thurg (not blood
often) nothing paths there and it's a totally safe place to med and pull
to.
