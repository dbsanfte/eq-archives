No, in this case by "locking" I mean make it so only the people it's
locked to can affect it, not so they're the one(s) who get the
rewards.  That would eliminate the chance of having others do most of
the work of killing it while giving you the reward, and thus encourage
grouping at least among the people who stop to think for a moment.
