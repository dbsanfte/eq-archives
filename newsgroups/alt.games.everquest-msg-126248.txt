I remember the thrill of finally actually killing one of those Vengefuls, he
was yellow to me, and I ended with just a tiny bit of one bubble of hp left,
but he was dead.  I even got two brewing books out of that quest in the end.
Last time I visited Halas, the quest giver attacked me, not sure what
faction she is on, but it's different from the rest of Halas apparently.
She was green, and I just ignored it, and went about my business.
