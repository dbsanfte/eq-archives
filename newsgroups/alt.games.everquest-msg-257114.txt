Well, since my discovery while on epic step 1 that procs on item in 
range slot happen while using damage/delay/range/damage bonus on item in 
ammo slot, I've been unable to find a proccing throwing weapon this 
works with.

I suspect this is because the item in range needs to be stackable; the 
throwing items with proc all seem not to be stackable, except for the 
cure disease ones given for the first step of the berserker epic.

It remains true that despite them being two different items, if you have 
  a stack of throwers in your range slot and a different stack of them 
in your ammo slot, you will use the ammo slot ones up when throwing, and 
when you get down to one, you'll use any items identicle to the ammo 
slot item up, then use the final ammo slot item, before moving on to the 
range slot item.

Soooo... I was killing in Echo, and picked up a stackable range slot 
item usable by berserkers, with horrible damage/delay (10/15) but with 
+5 str.

Putting this in ranged slot and my usual throwing axes in ammo, I again 
used the ammo axes first... but I do get the +5 str.

Of course eventually I'll run dry in the ammo slot through inattention 
and throw away the range slot item, so I won't want to go crazy buying 
anything expensive, but I'm going to look around for cheap stat benefit 
stackable throwers and see what I can come up with.

I haven't deliberately tried putting a non throwable range slot item in 
there, like an idol or something, but I'm pretty sure I tried it early 
on just fooling around and this didn't work, which is a pity because I'm 
currently wasting two slots in order to be able to do ranged damage; 
this trick is letting me get -some- benefit out of the range slot but 
its precarious so I'm not willing to spend a ton of pp on the idea.

I also don't know what happens when I get down to just one item in range 
slot and have identical items in inventory.  Ideally, it will throw that 
one, and leave the  inventory alone; this will mean that I'll only waste 
one item per mistake, then I'll get the no ammo warning, summon more 
axes for the ammo slot and my packs, then put the next thrower in place. 
  Going through them at 1 per mistake will mean I can buy several at a 
time and always have a backup for the stat or other benefit.

I also haven't yet tried putting non throwables in the ammo slot, not 
that there's a lot of reason to do so as the ammo slot doesn't give stat 
benefits from items there... but I know from experience as a magician 
that it does give vision benefits, so a coldstone or heatstone or orb of 
exploration (is this last ammo?  Nagging memory of it being range... but 
maybe it was just that it doesn't work in neck slot) would work there, 
and stack of regular throwers in range.
