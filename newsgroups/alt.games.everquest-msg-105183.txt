	Of course it does.

|Better weapon increases damage/second

	Thanks to the damage caps, you simply are not going to match the DPS of a
caster, though.

|Better Armour reduces down time

	To a point -- AC is soft-capped just as much as damage.

	Casters, of course, do not get hit if they don't want to.  (And in my
particular case, downtime is minimal anyway; Necros regain strength by
fighting.)

|Regen reduces down time

	For the handful of fighters who have regen items -- which don't exactly
grow on trees.

	If you think that adding mana to a caster twink doesn't improve it, then
take yours off -- and watch the results.  Adding mana directly increases a
caster's power.
