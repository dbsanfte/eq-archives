After 2 years playing I've recently created a character (gnome enchanter,
just like on my primary server where THAT one is level 52) on a different
server.

Even though I think I know all the shortcuts on Faydwer (gnome/wood elf/high
elf/dwarf continent) you've STILL got to pay your dues.

>>Such as, what server should I play in, which seems to have the most
friendly
players, players that like to interact with each other instead of screaming
out that they have something to sell all the time.  What type of character
should I be for my 1st character? etc. etc. etc.<<

Doesn't matter what server.  Crowded or relatively light, each types have
their advantages and each one has nice people, jerks, and zones that tend to
be heavy on auctions.

Doesn't matter which class/race you decide...there's no way for us to tell
you what you'd prefer, especially when you give us no personal information
about yourself beyond an unwillingness to pay your dues.

If after 7-10 days you did not get hooked on EQ I'd have to say that this
isn't the game for you.
