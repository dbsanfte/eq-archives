Thats incorrect. From what I remember, there was once a Windows version of
ShowEQ. This allowed tons more people to use it easily. So, noting a huge
increase of those using it, Verant implemented packet encryption. This broke
all versions of ShowEQ for months, until someone cracked the code. So, they
dont want that to happen again, so they stick to Linux, for population
control more than anything. The harder it is to use, the better I guess.

I guess you could experiment and see if ShowEQ works under VMWare running
Linux on a Windows 2000/XP host, then you'd know if its possible for Windows
to sniff the packets. But I'm almost positive that it is possible.
