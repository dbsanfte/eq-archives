Liar. And, a coward who snipes from behind killfiles.

I have no idea why you keep writing about this troll definition (3rd time in
the last few weeks). There seems to be something about it that is really
burning you up. Almost a year on, and that big ole vein throbs on your
sloping forehead every time the FAQ gets posted.

You seem to have some peculiarly horrid case of literary Tourette's syndrome
that affects your (alleged) writing, causing you to spout out random crap in
the midst of your more ordered crap. It does however, add some much needed
colour to the recycled insults addressing the 'morons' that plague your sad
abysmal life.

This is what happened. The actual thread is 272 messages long. That, of
course, excludes your posts which you are too embarassed to have anyone
read. And, who can blame you for that.

Now, get off my back.

"I was researching newsgroup etiquette. Lokari's advice was to the effect,
that it might be a good idea to look at any newsgroup FAQ, and take those
parts that might be pertinent to this newsgroup. Sound advice, because they
mostly appear to be reasonably similar.

You seem to think that the source somehow discredits the information. The
soccer newsgroup was simply the first on the list. It had a definiton of a
troll. I posted the definition, which you didn't like. I posted another
definition of troll from alt.fan.dragonballz. You didn't seem to like that
one either.

How many definitions do you think I should post? They all say much the same
thing. Below is the one I see most.

rec.music.classical
Ignore "trolls." Some people get a thrill from posting "flames" (really
obnoxious messages) just to get a rise out of people. Sad, isn't it?

Sad indeed"
