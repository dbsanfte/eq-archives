And that is exactly the point.  They prohibit selling, and reserve the
right to ban any ACCOUNT that has been transfered.  EVER.  

Further, Just like your ISP, they reserve the right to cancel any
account at any time.  The only recourse you MAY have is return of the
un-used portion of your monthly/quarterly/yearly billing.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
