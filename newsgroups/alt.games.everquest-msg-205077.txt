HUH??

Doesn't he just catch the ship and get off at the 2nd stop and presto -->
Freeport   ?
If the ships aren't working, hail the teleporter dudes that should be
standing on the dock there instead.

Well, I don't know about the faction hits so I'll leave that to others.

As far as the trip to Freeport goes,  I assume you don't have Plains of
Power or you wouldn't be asking how dangerous it is.  Doing it the
old-fashioned way, running, can indeed be dangerous at your level.  There
are numerous dangers along the way that Selo's Accelerando won't allow you
to escape.  You can probably avoid most of the creatures you can't outrun
while trekking through Karana although there's always the chance of
something spawning on top of you.  If you make it as far as High Hold, you
will have definite problems starting here, especially if you don't already
know the zone.  The paths are a bit convoluted and there are areas you're
extremely unlikely to get by without creatures giving chase.  If you know
exactly where you're going and you don't get any spellcasting types on your
tail, you can probably make it to the keep and from there make it to the
other side of the zone.  That's a lot of ifs...  Assuming you make it
through High Hold,  DO NOT travel through Kithicor at night.  Almost certain
death at level 11.  :)  Both commonland zones should be fine for you as long
as you keep your eyes open and avoid any creatures along the way.  Don't
even stop to fight any creatures conning as easy fights, something might
wander along and kill you and then you've got to start over.

It can be done.  Of course, I've only tried it once after level 10 and
before the invisibilty song because of the risk involved of having to make a
corpse run.

Hopefully, you have Plains of Power and can just take the easy, if not as
exciting, way through the Plane of Knowledge.

Good luck!
