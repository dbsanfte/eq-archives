this part referred to jade, wich is a minor gem and i thought it was less
than 1pp. but it's actually 4pp. (shame on me cause my alt is a gm-jeweler)
Basically got the idea that monk was farming jade. But reading original
message it's the other way around asking if someone wants to buy a stack of
jade for them. (iksars have low cha) and so together with my assumption of
the price i tought the other way around for specific gem. But buying for
them at 4pp makes sense. :-) (as i stand corrected)
