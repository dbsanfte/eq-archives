There's more group content than ever, but you need good ties and 
relationships to be able to get involved in it (pickup groups are not 
the norm).  Sony focus on the group game in theory.

Now's a good time to come back, all accounts and expansions are free 
until some time in july, hot zones have an extra extra 25% xp, you get a 
bunch of free step-up gear if you start playing again to help you catch 
up, etc., etc.
