The Death Gate Cycle consist of 7 books,

Dragon Wings, Elven Star, Fire Sea, Serpent Mage, The Hand of Chaos, Into
the Labytinth and The Seventh Gate.

They are great books, but if you never read Dragonlance the Chronicles or
Legends, you should read them first, they are just great.

Just an old Vicar.
