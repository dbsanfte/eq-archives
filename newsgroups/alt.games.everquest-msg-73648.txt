The Nexus is terrific for getting around as a non porting class! Plus having
a bank eitherin bazzar an shadowhaven and having a soulbinder is terrific!
/But it is usualy faster to go make your group than be part of one  alot of
the time.
so havind a zone like E/C would be a mess too many people all one spot lag
you out....
