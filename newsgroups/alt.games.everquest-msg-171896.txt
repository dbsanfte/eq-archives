lol I have and do use most of the nicknames you talked about. Wizzies come
to mind... I don't find that Gen-X or l337 talk... or even ever remotely
thought of being cool by using those nicknames. I think you are doing
exactly the same as anyone who would try to be cool by using genx talk...
trying to be cool by being normal.. whatever that is. I hope I'm wrong
though.

Sadly... you might filter them l337 people in your list... and you know
what? They never knew you or care to.
