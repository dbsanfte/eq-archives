Verant messed up on trade skills (and keeps repeating the mistake). With the
exception of alchemy and JC - you can get equivalent and usually better
items much more easily by camping mobs. (And without screwing your faction -
I used to be able to bank and sell in Kelethin and Felwithe, I have no
chance now.)

The *only* advantage I can see to cultural (certainly in the case of DE
cultural) is that int casters can wear the chain armour - and whilst the
non-armour stats aren't anything to cheer about - even with full enchanted
and imbued (8 failures and no successes btw!) - the ac is nice for an
enchanter and of course you don't look the same as all the other cookie
cutter clones.
