I was sitting in Freeport last night - I'd been hunting snakes for the 
scales (needed for a spell) and decided it was too monotonous.  I sat 
down and started advertising that I was trading SoW and all the buffs I 
got (5 or 6, iirc - the hardest problem being a shaman is deciding which 
buffs to mem :) ) - the VERY first person that comes up is a level 39 
(didn't bother to notice the class) decked out in beautiful armor.

Him: SoW?
Me: For 5 snake scales, yes.
Him: No free. I'm in a hurry.

Well, la-dee-da.

Me: Fine. 1 plat.

He handed me 10 gold and I cast.  THEN he goes "cheap n00bs".  Yeah, 
right. I'm sure that 1 plat cleaned out your ENTIRE bank account.

WHEN I ask for buffs I pay.  I usually pay 3P for binds and SoWs, and for 
other buffs, I ask what they'd like as a donation.  Half the time I get a 
"no thanks" and a cancel of the trade.  In that case I thank them 
appropriately.  The other half they accept and go "wow thanks, I can 
really use that!" and I *again* thank them appropriately.

Nobody NEEDS a SoW (but GOD do you hear that word 'need' a lot in 
relation to sows and tps :p).  I usually give em free at newbie areas as 
well - I mean heck, I created a shaman *because* I wanted to *give* buffs 
for once - and it's always the high levels that bitch at me for charging 
a whole plat for them to get it and insinuating that because I'm not 
giving *them* a free SoW, I'm the greediest, meanest bitch that ever 
lived.  Cry me a river, boy, then move on.  My mana will go to those who 
have an ounce less attitude in their play.
