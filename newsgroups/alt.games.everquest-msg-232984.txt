Well - he logged in, did stuff for about an hour before it cropped up.

It first showed up in Felwithe, then the character select screen went 
bonkers too.  I thought it was a memory leak, so he reset the machine,
but it came up straight into the same problem.

Athlon 1800xp, XP home, 384meg of ram and GF2 MX400 card.  It runs
old style EQ at 1024x768 with about half the models on, social animations
on and medium quality textures very smoothly.

Raid for us today, so I doubt he'll be testing before tomorrow again
at the earliest.
