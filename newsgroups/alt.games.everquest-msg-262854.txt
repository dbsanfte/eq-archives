My highest alt is level 32.  The alts I actually use for looking for 
things are my druid, ranger, and cleric.  First two because of tracking, 
last was for the Ancient Jarsath in FV, with sense undead.  Any others, I 
bind in a convenient spot, and gate in to check peridically.

I have had my baby trackers parked in unlikely places, and they've died a 
few times as a result, but, it's not a big deal.
