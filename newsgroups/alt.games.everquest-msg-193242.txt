Excellent information. Having come from a Skill based game (UO) to a
level based game I can see the differences. Over there you just fight
harder monsters for better loot. Here you fight harder monsters for
better experience (and loot). Something I hadn't thought about was
some are easier to kill. Another point is the zone giving different
experience. I didn;t know that! Thanks!
