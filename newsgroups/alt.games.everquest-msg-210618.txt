I've always just kept them... the bonechip turn-in quests, or my own 
necros... and the spider silk for my own tradeskilling.

I've balanced the 'lost income' by saving hundreds ... possibly 
thousands of pp because I didn't have to come and buy this crap later 
on... but its not the right way to go for everyone.

My bard hit 31st recently, and has around a k, just from selling loot to 
vendors... I don't think I've sold anything to another player with that 
char, and that's after spending money on gems for lambent (yeah yeah I 
know I can buy better than lambent in the bazzaar for less pp... but 
that's another story)
