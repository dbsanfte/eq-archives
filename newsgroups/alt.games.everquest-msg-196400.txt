Having many times handled 3 or 4 extras as a bard, it does indeed seem
reasonable.  A necro can do the same thing.  On the other hand, an Enchanter can
handle 10 extra mobs and keep everyone alive and happily killing one at a time.
Its not pleasant, but it can be done, I've seen it happen.  I've also seen it
-almost- work, so that everyone in the group died but my cleric and the chanter,
who then kept those 10 mobs locked down while I rezed, healed, and buffed the
rest of the party so we could get ready to clean up the mess.  And I've seen it
fail.  Learning to let everyone die but the chanter was a hard lesson, but in
the end, nothing matters more than him and me... and if I can click a rez on a
paladin, not even me.

A good enchanter is in some situations the only acceptable mezzer.
