Right.  The people that write EQ hacking programs generally are doing so
for the challenge.  The programs are usually given away free.  Someone
charging for one is definitely not to be trusted--watch out for trojans.

Also, the consensus among people who hack EQ is that you can't hack
infinite money client-side.  The closest you can come to that is you can
hack it so that it doesn't cost anything to train skills at your guild
trainer, so you could train all your tradeskills to 200.  Perhaps a
character with 200 in all skills could do something profitable?
