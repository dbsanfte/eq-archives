Sorry, you're right, I should have.

Yes, an omniscient God seems to be incompatible with free will.  The two
solutions to this dilemma seem to be:

1. God is not omniscient.  Instead, he knows all the things it's possible
   for him to know, but not the things it's not possible for him to know.
   Despite objections in another thread, I would still happily label this
   slightly more limited entity God, and would assume he purposefully
   limited himself in order to give us the gift of free will.

2. It's beyond our intellect to understand how an omniscient God and free
   will aren't incompatible.

Right.  You, me, and every other life form in the universe would actually
be nothing more than mindless automatons.

Random is one thing, unpredictable is another.  I have no problem stating
the universe is unpredictable, but that's due to complexity, not because
of some underlying randomness to the universe.

For the universe to have some truly random elements seems impossible.

Even that wouldn't be free will, in my opinion.  Shuffling a deck isn't
the same as the deck itself deciding the Ace of Spades will end up on
top once the shuffling is complete.
