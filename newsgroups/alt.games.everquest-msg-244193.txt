Hey, great job. I was wondering, on the Drawings of the characters...
You tend to super-impose the name.

I'm no art critic, but personally, it distracts me so much that I
can't really enjoy the otherwise very cool drawings.

Are these meant to be your watermarks so they can't be stolen, or is
that how you envisioned them? And... any chance you will post them
without the names, or with the name below or to the side?
