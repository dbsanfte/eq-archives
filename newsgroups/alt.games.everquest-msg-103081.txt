Well look at it and its pretty clear.  OOC is a zone wide channel for
out of character communication.  So it would follow that it is for
communicating in an out of character fashion to the entire zone.  If
your communication is meant for the entire zone, then that's  OOC.  If
you are chatting with a friend there are several other options available
to you which are better choices such as /tell  or a private channel. 
Two d00ds comparing  penis size is not exactly something that needs to
be shared with an entire zone.  Maybe folks need to set up the
"penissize" channel so those who enjoy such things can share their
greatness with like minded folks across the entire server rather than
just blathering to the folks in a single zone.
