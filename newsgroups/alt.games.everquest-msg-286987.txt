Relative to itself.  Compared to the size of characters, the buildings 
in Qeynos seemed too tall, and the streets too wide.

Old cities should actually feel cramped by our standards.  Look at small 
towns in Europe, for example.  They were built to accommodate foot 
traffic and horses, with the occasional cart, and so when you fill them 
with cars and buses, it is cramped.  Qeynos felt like it was designed 
for cars and buses, but in EQ, transportation for most citizens is foot 
and horseback.

(And no, I was not playing a short race! :-)).
