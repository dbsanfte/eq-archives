Oh, you can believe that I will. I wrote the GM a letter telling him what
happened, that I was in the wrong and wanted to publicly apologize to the
guy if he would let me. I may be a dumbass occasionally, but I do know when
I'm in the wrong, and usually not too much longer since I've -been- the
dumbass. I recall reading that thread now and it seemed to me that you
certainly had every right to be about as po'd as this guy was. He wasn't
aware of "doing anything wrong" and in fact, was completely in his rights as
far as Verant is concerned. So I was wrong in 2 ways -- using foul language
with him and thinking that he actually WAS doing something wrong. (see, I
shoulda been reading all those messages with the word "faction" in them
instead of ignoring them all this time!)

sigh. The GM's little canned note to me said that he'd be gone Thuesday and
Friday, so I guess I'll find out then. You'd better believe ONE thing is
true -- I'll get/have the facts before I jump on someone again. And that's
the -first- time I ever did that, even though I've been trained and killed
as many times as other people here.

thanks Biz,
Darklet
