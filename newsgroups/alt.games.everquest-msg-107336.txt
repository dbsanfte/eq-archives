A snare fear group consists of snarer, fearer (often both one person) and
tank.

The necro alone has all elements of this group.

A rogue is an excellent addition to such a group, as you pretty much
guarantee
yourself exposed backs.

The wizzard speeds things up a bit with nuking, but isn't as serious a
contender
as a second rogue would have been. On the other hand, you were using him as
"hate kiter" while the fear wasn't on.  Wizards can also handle the snare
job,
root for crowd control, and go run get you some beer if you run low.

Cleric could have (should have) taken over the Fear job there, and added
another
rooter... but again those are jobs the necro can handle all alone if it
comes to that.

What you discovered isn't so much that your weird group composition works,
but
that Reverse Kiting works pretty darn well outdoors.  Just by chance, with
the addition
of the cleric you could have seen the necro decide to log for the night
without losing
anything but some of the firepower, and could have replaced him with another
rogue
to actually increase your working efficiency.

Bergh Brelltender
56 cleric

Shrouds, 22 necro
Srimp, 30 druid
Finneous, 19 rogue

Never played a wizard... its vaguely possible, come to think of it, that
your wizard was
too low level to get snare yet.
