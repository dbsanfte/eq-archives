50 is similar to 49; exp moves a little bit slower, but it's a similar ratio
to the 49:48 ratio.

It looks like at 51, for me at least, experience slowed down to something
around a quarter to a third of experience at 50. I did the shopping quest
at 51 and earned a little under one blue; at 51 it earned about a third of
that (difficult to judge).

Basically pre-Kunark levels only went up to 50, so the progression there is
fairly smooth. 51 to (I'm guessing) 60 uses a different, and much slower,
rate.

So 51 is where the fun starts. It's a large part of why the PoP zones are
so popular - tough MOBs and lots of them with a high modifier, so experience
increases at a speed comparable to pre-50.
