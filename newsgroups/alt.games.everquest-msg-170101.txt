Saw it last night. All I can say is Wow. If you happened to catch the
little documentary that WB had on the making of TTT a couple weeks ago,
you will even MORE appreciate the character Gollum. When I saw him my
jaw dropped. The fact that he's CGI is beyond comprehension. I think I
missed bits of the movie because I was just watching him move.

Even knowing the basics of how they did it from the documentary didn't
take away from the OMFG! factor when I saw him the first time in that
fight with Sam.
