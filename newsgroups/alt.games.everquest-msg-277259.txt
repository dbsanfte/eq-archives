I bought one for 5s! Sure that must have been a mistake since the other
ones were selling for over 1g!! Mind you I sell one for under 8s.

It is much easier to sell stuff now but people still have no idea how
to sell stuff. For instance the scroll I sold for 8s I've been trying
to sell for weeks. There were about 30 others listed all more expensive
then me. Who do they think is going to but them?

As for the person selling a resource item 1p that I couldn't shift
for 1c and you can buy of a NPC for 6c. Words fail me!

Depends on the area. I was in Thundering Stepps for the first time in
ages and its miles better then I remember it. Much easier to find mobs.
Not having agroed the Cents helped a lot.

It would be nice if some mobs and areas are down graded from heroic to
individual encounters. Places where groups don't normally go like
Vernin's Syne, Firemyst Gully etc. I've only ever seen individuals
in there, so it makes sense to change the areas to reflect the players
who go there.
