Actually, if you have the GoD expansion that's no longer an issue.
You can raise any tradeskill (except Research) to 54 for free, if
you're willing to spend some time at it.  And using points to jump
the skill to 21 doesn't help: you still have to do just as much
work if you're using the GoD quests to raise it to 54.  On the plus
side, you don't need to do any farming. :-)
