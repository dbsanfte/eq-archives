David:

Had problems with EQ and XP like this as well. Install the latest Creative
Labs drivers (dated 11/29 -no kidding) and download and install the MS XP
WDM patch for Sound Blaster. After this things seem to work fine. The only
issue I have is my music volume seems a not high - not a problem I just
turned down the music a bit.
