I highly doubt "Sony's vision of a player economy" included newbies who 
play for 50+ levels without seeing anything drop that was better than 
the stuff they could *easily* afford to purchase from players by level 5.

Twinking is defined as getting gear far beyond your level. 50th level 
drops are easily acheived by 5th level players 'working to earn them' by 
farming decaying skeletons; at best its self twinking. And hardly 
irrational to call it that.

At worst, it perpetuates the breed of newb who gets to 50th level 
without ever grouping, or learning to play their class, because they've 
been 'over equipped' relative to the mobs they've been fighting for 
their whole career. And then at 50th, they ruin everyone elses day as 
they demonstrate their still-5th level playing abilities... marginally 
better than an ebayer.

But I think we've covered all this before, to no fruitful ending. So I'm 
not looking to elighten DT or change his mind, merely looking to balance 
out the universe by letting the op know that there *are* people who 
don't think he's irrational.
