Yeah, "if"...

The other problem is that when he has the Bladed Thulian Claws
(which he usually does), he hits so fast that it's hard to
get a spell off without being interrupted.

I've taken him down easily enough with just a Cleric for
backup (two complete heals was enough), or another 50-ish
Paladin, but solo it just hasn't been possible.
