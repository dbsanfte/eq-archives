I have no idea why people use web boards, they suck. Too slow, too cumbersome
too filled with all those stupid html and graphic sigs that people use. Its stupid.
Someone should just set up a Usenet type server so we can all use News clients
to read it.

Web boards suck. They only reason people use them is because 95% of web
users are too stupid to figure out how to use a newsreaders.
