Yes, anybody who uses any form of snare understands your point.
But for grouping the new focus effect is better, it makes DoTs
mana efficient in shorter fights.  And for root/dotting it is
also an improvement, fewer roots required.  So it sounds like
a small nerf for SKs (I'm thinking snare is far more important
than DoT efficiency to an SK), a wash for Necros (your DoTs are
improved while your snares are degraded), and a boost for Shaman
and Druids.
