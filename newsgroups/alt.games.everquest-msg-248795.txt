The other night, playing my ranger character, at the spires in North
Karana,.  I get my portal stone and wait for the spires to transport
me to Nexus.  I figure I should /hide while I'm waiting so I won't get
attacked by any wandering mobs, so I hit my /hide hotkey.  Then:

====================

You try to kick Nexus Scion but Nexus Scion is INVULNERABLE.
Nexus Scion was hit by non-melee for 1 point of damage.
Nexus Scion was pierced by thorns.
Nexus Scion punches you for 2054 points of damage.
You have been knocked unconscious.
You have been slain by Nexus Scion.
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT. . .

====================

Oops!  :-P
