Yep, thats one answer, and I guess its the one thats generally 
implemented, everything comes back from the dead.  Sort of makes the 
whole world into a horror show though, doesn't it?

Now -that- would be fun; give the mobs exp loss on death, and let them 
earn exp killing PCs and for that matter, other mobs.  You could create 
a dynamic world that grows on its own!

This would help a little, but just changing names and not content 
doesn't really do much more than help shore up the illusion a little.

Which is why I came up with this idea, utilizing the instancing that we 
already see; let each person experience the instanced content only once, 
by putting it into instances that allow him to do so without affecting 
everyone else.

Its simple enough to do this for single player computer games, the 
problem comes when you try to support thousands simultaneously and not 
have content run out.  I suggest that you could use instancing to give 
individuals much of the dynamic flavor possible in a single player game, 
while leaving most of the world massively multiplayer and interactive.

Particularly, I was excited by someone's suggestion that you don't have 
to instance whole zones to do this, you could just instance small sub 
zones, and control who can and can't get into them via flags.

The way I presented it was very linear, but it wouldn't have to be, you 
could set things up so that in Instance 1 if you do X, you then can get 
to Instance 2, but if you do Y you can get to instance 3 instead.  Since 
you can't go back to instance 1, your actions have changed the nature of 
the world for you, you -either- get instance 2 or 3, but never both. 
Then 2 can branch to 4 or 5, and 3 can branch to 6 or... interestingly, 
perhaps to 5.

The current system of EQ1 also came down to making new content all the 
time, because people exhausted it by leveling up past the low level 
stuff, and by getting all the rewards that dropped off a given mob. 
You'd have the same trouble with my plan, but I don't think you'd have 
significantly -more- trouble.
