Love my bard. Was nuts to make it my first toon (was a newb, didn't know),
but it sure forced me to learn fast. 8 Alts later, still my main, still my
fav.

As for Monks, the only folks I see calling them "worthless" are folks that
were spoiled and came to expect that having a way overpowered class was
their god given right. Never played a monk all the way up (have one, but low
as yet), but the 3 60+ monks I know all said pretty much the same thing when
this happened: "Wow - sucks, but they were right, we were way the hell
overpowered".

Monks are still the mondo dealers of melee damage if you ask me. They are
still the best pullers in the game too. Every class has it's role. If I
wanted to wine, I could complain that my Bard doesn't have a single thing
that he's great at. Then again - that's his strength isn't it? Because he
has sooooo many things that he's "good" at.

Get over it already. SOE is always going to be tweaking with character
balancing as new things come along, people implement new strategies that SOE
couldn't or didn't see coming, etc., etc., etc.. If you read this group, one
would thing that no nerf was ever justified on any class. Indeed, all
classes would just merge into the new "Justice league of America" class,
where everyone could kill any mob any time, and no kryptonite was found
anywhere on Norrath ever.

Geez.
