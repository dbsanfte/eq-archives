When you get to level 4 you'll acquire the channeling skill; go back
to your guild and train one practice point in that; it will start
going up on its own.  That will help you get your spells off even when
being hit (you'll see a message saying "You regain your concentration
and continue your casting").  

A lot of it is timing and trial and error; I find it's easier for me
to land spells when I start casting right after *I* hit the mob (I'll
look and see "you try to hit mob, but miss" or "you hit mob for 5
points of damage", then right after that message I'll cast the spell.
But once you get channeling you'll get less interruptions.
