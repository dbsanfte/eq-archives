 If he talks to you and gives you the quest he should give you the key
when you turn the pieces in. Depending on race, you may need wolfform to
get your faction such that he doesn't attack you. Other classes with
sneak can just go behind him and turn the stuff in.

 Basically, con him and see where you are faction wise. If you're not
KoS, hail him and see if he responds. If so, hand in the items. If you
are KoS and you can't sneak, see if you can get a wolfform then check
faction again. 

 It's been awhile since I've done it so maybe they put him on
betaneutral. Probably not but it would have been the smart thing to do,
like with the Sebilis and Veeshans Peak key guy.
