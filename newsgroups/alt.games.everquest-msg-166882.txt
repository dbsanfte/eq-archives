Skyfire often has mobs by the druid port in, and they will agro you, and
some are quite high. The good news is that none of the run fast, and the
only thing you need to bother about is chromodrac dispel magic. You should
still be able to strafe-outrun them... just check out a map first.
Emerald jungle is usualy clear on port in, but not always. The mobs here are
weak tho, and with sow you should have no problems.
Cobalt scar is dangerous without decent cov faction. The wandering cobalt
drakes are nasty.
