Friday night ( I think ), I took my Warrior to the Moon to get another 
Rallic Pack for me or a Guildie.  Right after I get there, I get a tell 
from one of my normal group-members asking if I can make it to Tim Deep 
pronto.

Turns out there were ( from what I gathered ) 2 spawns there, with one 
dropping a FRSS ( Flowing RED Silk Sash ), and one dropping an Enduring 
Breath necklace.

The FRSS was lore, of course, and my group-member was trying to get one for 
all of the people in our group that could make use of it ( 2 War, Monk, 
Bard ). My Rogue was in N. Ro, so I jumped the barge and met them in Tim 
Deep, where he handed me the FRSS.  I then logged and worked on a Rallic 
Pack for a bit.  I did look at the FRSS first, and it was a haste item like 
he said.  He told me that people were claiming that it had the same haste 
as an FBSS, but no one had any proof.

It was getting late, so I logged.

I get up Saturday, and when I logged in, I took the Rogue over to where the 
guys were spawning and it was empty.  No spawns, no one there to kill them.  
They told me the pop times were relatively fast for the guys, so I waited.  
Nothing.

About an hour later, another gorup-member of mine logs on and asks if I had 
been back there and I told him I had, but it was empty.  He had the same 
experience.

I logged soon after to go watch OSU run the rock some, and was pretty much 
in a half-drunken stupor for the next 12 hours.  I haven't been back on 
since Sat. morning so I haven't heard any more about these spawns.

It looks like these pirate guys were an accident.  The group-member that 
was getting the belts said they showed up after the last patch.  Was there 
a patch late Friday night or early Sat. that would have removed these guys?

Did any of you see them and get the FRSS or the EB neck item?  I was told 
the level of the guy dropping the FRSS was about 25 or so, so if the FRSS -
is- close to the FBSS in haste, it sure looks like a mistake to me.

Any info?
