The player has a valid point despite your inane ramblings.
LD Death is the most aggrivating "feature" of playing EQ as the player
has NO control over the outcome. Whatever the reason for it there is
no good reason for Verant to handle the issue the way it currently
does, except for bad programing/grouping mentality which I think is
close to the bone.

As for getting a group ..well who the hell are you to tell this player
how to conduct his affairs? If he is whining then you're whining
too..think about it. The thing is LDs have gone WAY up lately for
whatever reason and its not easy to say why. Putting up with it? Get a
grip you have no idea how bad it is for some of us all of a sudden
going LD a dozen times in 2 hours, death being the result of 3 of
them. How do you put up with that?

For example a Druid is able to quad...nothing beats it for skill, XP,
and fun. Its valid game play so dont even think about pissing on that.
Ya dont do that in a group. I figgure if he just stops cold as in
going LD hes got 10-15 seconds to live, plenty of time for the server
to detect LD and put him into a safe mode, but they dont for the
simple reason they wont. 

That is the issue here not the way another player enjoys his game.
