As a 52 shammy, I use IoS alot.  There are times in a group or LDoN, when
people prefer to have their stats increased as much as possible (Sta, Str,
Dex, Agi), for example if they have a proc'ing weapon.  For those I use IoS
and the individual buffs because I can increase all 4 by approximately 100
points.   With HoS, none of the stat buffs stack with it, save for Agi which
HoS doesn't provide anyway.  And Sta, IIRC.

If I have Virtue or HoV, then I find that I get better return by having all
my stats in the 200++ range with IoS, than the additional 2-300 hp that HoS
provides (Can't remember the exact number offhand)

If I don't have Virtue or HoV, then I like HoS.

Just my 2cp.  Maybe it's an invalid thought process, but I like it.
