Yeah I loved doing the armour quests in Gfay for my 1/2 Elf Bard. I only got
him a centi short sword at creations but he earned the rest.. I had some
help in mistmoore getting the battle drums and had some handouts but he is
sure fun to play. When he became 25 orso I bought some better AC gear,
because then the newbie armour is not that good then anymore. Only have the
vambraces left on him. :)

Singatune. lvl 33, 1/2 Elf Bard
