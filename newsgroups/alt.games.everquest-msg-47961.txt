After a nights sleep I woke up with a couple questions and the solution to
all this.

Any *moron* looking at Google can see you've got a *history* (a long one) of
anonymous posters stalking you on Usenet, Ron.  From *cooking* newsgroups,
to *hiking* newsgroups, and even here in our EverQuest newsgroup.  Did you
have an anonymously posting stalker when you posted to the Ultima Online
newsgroups too, Ron?

Strange that out of the millions of people who use Usenet everyday, you seem
to be very special, a man alone, with a reoccurring theme of anonymously
posting "stalkers".

I think you've "gone to the well" one time to many, Ron.
*You* posted this again didn't you, Ron?
*You're* the person, who posted this crap originally, aren't you Ron?
"brilliant" is what you called it, wasn't it, Ron?
*You've* been anonymously "stalking" *yourself* for years haven't you, Ron?


For someone that was supposedly in your killfile, these recent events beg me
to ask a couple more questions, Ron.
Did your *forged* post from me last week not go through? You forgot to check
and make sure it went through did *you* Ron? Made a mistake didn't you? You
seemed *very* sure (overly so) that there should have been a post from me
containing the exact same information this thread started with; a little too
sure.

Wasn't I in your killfile Ron? Why suddenly did I get out of it? Why start a
pissing match with me now? Why Ron, why now? Were you feeling lonely and
unloved *again* Ron? Dredging up the *old* "tried and true" I'm being
anonymously stalked cry for attention again, Ron?
