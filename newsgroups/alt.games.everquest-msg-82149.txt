Well, you have certainly given me enough info to last awhile :) That Evil
Eye I managed to kill last night with friend's help had an "imperfect
diamond". Sold for a bit of pp :) THAT helped the old bank account!

Actually, I haven't been killing shit in the Gorge, mostly because ex
boyfriend said that it was a "dangerous place".. of course, that was about 5
levels ago ;) Mostly I've been kiting stuff (gorge hounds, etc) in the
Karanas. I even managed to kill a Griff last night, with friend's help ;)
Always ran from those, before, and will again unless he's there to heal/buff
me! :)

Yeah, gorge hounds seem to have next to nothing as far as loot is concerned,
and they hit really HARD! But it looks like the exp is decent. (know of a
good URL where they list that?)

The Gorge the same as Beholder's? If not, will need to get a map from
eqatlas...

OK, so I will need to wait a few levels for Lork Syrkl and Svir? What level
are they, if you know? Just a guess will be good enough!

thanks for the info, Zymyool!
