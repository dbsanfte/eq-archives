> So what were YOU doing last night?

Hung around EC trading, with Bard, got a tell from a druid looking for
someone to help them find their corpse in Iceclad, was on phone so at the
time so couldn't help but gave tell back to see if "she" still needed help
when conversation finished. Bug had dropped for her 10k damage and into the
ocean (somewhere) when she ported, LD shortly after ruined any chances of GM
assistance. Met up in WC, located corpse with no difficulties (miles away
from Dragon portal) turned down offer of 100pp for donation (had thought it
might be an attempt at a wind up to dump me in Velious, a few recent scam
attempts had been met with laughter and petitions from me so I was feeling a
little paranoid) Anyway, she got her body back and I got some faith back in
ppl.

Friend logged in (recent drop off from DAoC, luckily I kept the majority of
his equipment, knew he'd be back) and left with mains to Luclin, get some
easy exp in Echo caverns. Things going well, get taskmaster on track, bring
my 51 warrior to the group and take task master. Helped later by a 55
paladin who lets us take the taskmaster, again when it should have been his,
thankyou, Amrakat.
Eventually have to evac when Thought Horror pops. Still got a lot of
levelling to do on friend but have a new plan for that.

It's getting late now, head back to EC, sell my Centi Longsword (nice
weapon, need faster for primary, will get one later to partner a lammy)
Trade Shaded Blade for Crystallized spider fang (gave my last one to friend)
Blade is another nice weapon but too heavy to carry for a Dark Elf (weighs
8) and is not magic (think this is an error atm, the Shaded dagger IS a
magic item but the blade is not) Currently have about 11k in plat with a
poss 3.5 to come in sales, can now afford my Lammy. Saw a pair of Cobby
gaunts up for 2k but couldn't buy them, already have a pair, had second
account off and all money on main not mule (friend had logged also whom I
was going to buy them for) still, price drops like that are normally the
start of a trend. Would prefer to get boots (seen them for 4k recently but
at that time I had about half that, hehe, little over 2k to 11k in a matter
of 2 weeks, nice what a good run of luck will do for you in EC)

How about this for an attempt to scam, 1st level monk, gives me a tell
saying Hello (this is normally a bad sign, people that trade will either ask
for stats, ask if their said class race can use it or make an offer) I
respond and up comes this monk, he wants to buy the sword but with hi rogue
in FV, can I go over there...No I say, but I can get him ported to here...No
good, the rogue won't leave FV (previous alarm bells now turn into,
Warning:This is a Scam...wait for it) I don't bother waiting for his next
line and reply that I am sorry but I am not that gullable...He doesn't read
this, he's still typing out his elaborate plan...I give his 1st Monk the
Sword, he gives it to his Warrior and in the mean time I need to go to FV
and collect the 8k!! he'll pay (I'm asking 4k) /report /petition /bye
He later offers me a Wurmy for it, I add him to ignore.
Spending time in EC is a good way to lower your perceptions of people, as
well as fill your ignore list.
