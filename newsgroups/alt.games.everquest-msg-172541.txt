I was playing my 54 Shaman and my 3 year old son was playing my 54 Paladin
on my laptop next to me. We were in everfrost, and he killed a skeleton. He
looted the corpse, and said, just as happy as can be, "Look Daddy! I'm gonna
get you some bone crackers! You can eat em!".

 I was rofl. Get it? Chips = Crackers.

 Funny stuff!!

 My son has his own 7 druid, 5 SK, and 4 BST that he loves to play. He may
be the youngest EQ'er out here.
