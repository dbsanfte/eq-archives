AA points have only appealed to the truley addicted all along even
though that number is high its not most players, there may well be
8,000 different players(not accounts) on a server with 2,000 to 3,000
above 60 leaving a huge majority to wallow in the mire so to
speak........no  way to prove it either way. But my experience is that
the 50s grind runs off more people than an other single "feature" in
EQ followed by these never ending nerfs. Cant say anyone really enjoys
it, for sure I know SoE admitted the 50s xp curve was a bad move which
means costs them money.
