I just recently started having problems with heavy lag during 
battles...it only happens when I'm grouping (never when I'm soloing), and 
it goes away when the battle is over...sometimes I'll camp and reboot, 
which fixes it temporarily, but a few minutes later it starts again. Have 
any of you had this problem, and if so, how did you fix it?

I have a P4 1.3 ghz/128 mb ram/GeForce2 MX...
