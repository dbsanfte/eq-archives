go back to playing with people who aren't shits.

Real character?  I *AM* a mage.  It took me several 
characters played into the 20's (the first a bard
at release) to finally find the class I most enjoy
playing.  While I have the others, they are retired
and stripped.  I also have 2 bots (well, my buddy
and I have 2 bots on our 2 extra accounts) but I'd
never consider retiring my mage and picking up any
of them as a new main.  I enjoy being a mage too much.

I really don't give a shit if high end guilds aren't 
knocking down my door, I play to have fun - and standing 
around dropping rods wasn't fun.  I'd rather play lower 
end content, where no optimizing of classes needs to be
done just to have a chance at succeeding without lagging
the zone out, and have fun, than high end content and be 
bored stiff.  I've been on raids where I did nothing but 
rod - no thank you.

If that means I never see some parts of EQ, because the 
only way to get there is with an optimized class loadout
that doesn't include mages - then I won't see them. 
I'm reconciled to never seeing VT, lower Ssra - an Emp
Seru fight, or any of ToV (other than as a tourist).
The latter is because I like the skyshrine dragons, and
(little as I roleplay) no phat lewts are going to make
me turn on them.  Besides - show me one item out of there
that would actually make a difference for a mage.  So
equipment independent (still) that it's not even funny.
Heck, I can't be bothered to get my Int over 200 - I have
3 spots that always have summoned focus items, and I 
beefed up my hp over int before the mod-rod nerf.
