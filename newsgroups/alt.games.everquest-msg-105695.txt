Make sure you're not trying to use a certain type of spell on NPCs that have
high resists to that type of spell.  For example, if you go trying to cast
combust on SolA goblins, the goblins are likely to resist regardless of what
level they are because they have high innate fire resistance.  What are you
trying to kill and what spells are you using?  If that isn't the problem,
there's really not a whole lot you can do about it except get to a higher
level or group with classes who can debuff resists.
