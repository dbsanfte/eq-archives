what a wide range of responses...

with these kinds of responses i'm almost happy to be the one asking the
question, from the sounds of it Colcannon, slapfish and i might be the only
few who have a life outside of eq. the fact that it may be believed that
"99.99" percent of y'all assumed they got it right makes me think that it's
verging on being pathetic that a such a schedule of inform is even needed.
who cares, go check the web site from time to time, that's part of the fun.
so i may have gotten excited and confused but at least i'm not desperate for
crumbs of information about a future expansion... it's a game, that's it !

to colcannon, thank you for helping, i see from your reply that i simply got
over excited about the new expansion. thank you for clearing everything up
;-)

to slapfish, thanks for being a real person who is able to be rational and
understanding

to everyone else with more attitude then i ever thought possible, get a
life, it's a game, and we are simply people who are trying to have a little
fun and get a little excited once in a while... it is people like you who
ruin resources like this news group.

no i'm not pissed off, i'm actually laughing at this... big time lol ;-)
