From the shadows, the mysterious bizbee <tuberoo@ix.netcom.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Bizbee, it's not his job. There is only one person who does any CS on
Test server, a senior guide who isn't on all that often (they can call
for SWAT help if something truly horrific happened). The GMs go
through the petitions for bugs that need immediate addressing. If the
queue gets swamped by morons abusing each other, their job is
*hampered*.
