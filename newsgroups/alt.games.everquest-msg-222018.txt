I have a level 56 magician and I'm finding I can't go through the same solo
grind to get to 61 as I did with a previous character (not even 10% an hour
solo).  I'm looking to try to get into a PoP group but am lost about which
plane to get started in.  My perception is that PoJ is now the home of
characters maybe just a little lower level than I am and PoI or PoN is more
up my alley.  Any advise about striking out into the Planes?
