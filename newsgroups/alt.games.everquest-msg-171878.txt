Level 24 Wizard Looking for Group
Level 24 Druid Looking for Group

Druid = SoW, Evac, Snare, Nuke, Heal, Damage Shield, HP Buff, Root,
Regen
Wizard = Evac, Nuke, Root, weak Damage Shield

Which one would you choose for your group first? 

It doesn't take an "extremist number cruncher" to see the advantage of
taking the Druid over the Wizard. It basically comes down to which
class offers the best bang for the buck.

I am not saying that Wizards are "excluded" intentionally from groups.
They are simply less attractive due to thier limited utility compared
to other classes. If a Wizard has to compete for groups with classes
that offer more utility to a pick-up group, he/she is more often than
not going to lose out. This is why the notion that nerfing ManaBurn
hurt the chances of Wizards getting groups is so ridiculous. Wizards
will always have problems finding groups until they hit thier 50s. The
nerfing of ManaBurn simply made the class slightly less attractive to
the powerlevlers and power-"lewterz".
