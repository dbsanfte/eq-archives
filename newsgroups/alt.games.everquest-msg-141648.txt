Ok, so it seems out of my reach to solo for armor but how hard would it be
for a 51 Shaman and a 51 Warrior to find a group easily for the sole reason
of getting armor upgrades?

Also, I can get a 48 Druid, 47 Wizard and a 47 Warrior to help but not all
of the time.  Would we be able to do some parts of the arena alone? Maybe
with a Cleric?

Thanks again
