I'm not sure anyone mentioned a few things.  The zone is like a maze. 
The first several rooms and corridors on the DSP side are filled with
the lower level mobs, but if you have a 55+ or so group, you can invis
past them til you get to the area where the named will spawn.  This is
really the part of the zone we spent most of our time.  You will get
there when you no longer see those ugly, floating, legless things all
over the place, past a little gate.  If you have a tracker, search for
Servitor of Luclin.  He spawns near this area.  He can also be a fun
target for a high level group or a couple lower level groups with a
couple mildly nice drops.  The named in there can spawn as any luclin
model for some reason.  Sometimes they will be coterie, sometimes
underbulks, etc...And they proc or cast skeleton illusions on the
tank...kinda fun.  The keys they drop get you in to see Servitor and
Grieg.

Oh and Im too lazy to look up his name, but stay the hell away from
the mob that drops the weapon that procs divine aura.  He is
unsnarable, so difficult to kite, and seems to be invincible most of
the time.  (And if I recall, continues to attack while invincible). 
Maybe a Wizard can mana burn him or something...I have no idea how you
are supposed to kill him, and we stopped trying after the first two
wipes.
