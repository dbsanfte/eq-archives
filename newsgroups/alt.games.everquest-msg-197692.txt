This months Uber News was going to be about how melee's suck at high end of
the game compared to the MOB they fight. However this is something SOE have
also realised, and are working on it. So i'll just make a random rant.

!!!!!!!!!!!!! DAMMIT SOE.. LIFT THE MANABURN EMBARGO !!!!!!!!!!

I guess the real issue is that everything over level 30 is not balanced with
PCs at the same level. This issue also causes the high end of the game to
lose pace. You can seldom do anything alone, your char can barely go to the
toilet alone at 65. You spend more time looking for something to do that you
are able to do, than actually doing something.

In the young days, we always had something to do, there was always a blue
mob somewhere, that wasnt gonna summon and quadhit us for 999 damage
instakill. Or we could do quests, but even most quests you are forced into
doing with a raidforce these days. Ok, i admit, i am lucky here, coz i have
a raidforce able to knock down ubermobs, but this is getting boring now.
Endless raids everyday... it kinda gets to ya after a while. Sometimes I
just wanna go online, play a little bit and have some fun and a little xp,
maybe do a tradeskill or two and relax whilst doing fun stuff solo. But at
high end of the game... you cant. The game dynamics have changed so much and
the camps are too few, and you need a slower and tank. Thats why they should
implement "Uber Nukah's Protective Shielding From Summoning". This would
allow more people to farm, xp and have fun online. I say farming here,
because at high end of the game, you dont need xp, but getting phat loot is
ALWAYS FUN... and thats not doable anymore solo. So.. the fun is gone?

The pace of the game has slown down, and either you are forced into joining
a guild and going with them on raiding events, or you might as well stop
playing the game, because you cant do much online anymore solo. I seriously
hope that EQ2 balances out these issues better, so at high levels you still
retain equal power to the NPCs/MOBs. Yes it was fun when you where a newbie
and you had to have 30 rowdy men in a Zlandicar raid etc etc. But after a
while... it isnt. I want to go solo and just join a few raiding forces on
occaisson... but i cant because of the way the game is designed at high
level. Its just like TicTacToe... you can force the game into stalemate and
the game is ruined forever on. Thats why people dont play TicTacToe anymore.

Whilst the Velious uber mob Zlandicar is now being killed by 1 group (not
wizards), shammy's and necromancers soloing so called oldworld uber MOBs,
and SOE isn't doing anything about it. Ofcourse they shouldnt, these people
played hard to become "godly" and thats the way the game is designed. But
when a group of wizards manaburn and kill kunark uber mobs.. SOE says "ahh
yes.. lets nerf manaburn!". Biased? Yes ofcourse it is. I don't understand
SOE reckoning. Then again wizards rain damage cant deal the killing blow
(does work on light blues and greens tho), so i guess SOEs reckoning is
something like "if wizards can kill anything that doesnt require a dd shock
they should be nerfed, and if the dd shock is called manaburn then it should
be nerfed and should already be nerfed from before.. and infact no wizard
should even have spent any aaxp points into manaburn coz we manaburned
nerfed it to oblivion anyway".

!!!!!!!!!!!!! DAMMIT SOE.. LIFT THE MANABURN EMBARGO !!!!!!!!!!

When you where uber at level 30, level 30 mobs used to fear you.
When you are uber at level 65, level 65 mobs laugh at
you...........zzzzzzzzzz
I think its just about time to check out Shadowbane. I think i just about
burned myself out on EQ lately. Time to take a break. My guild has lost a
few good uber people in favor to this game, and i'm wondering if i should
give it a try too. Maybe they have retained a balance throughout the entire
game? Omg.. who knows?


Cheers!
