Not just tanks, this week Israel bombed the house of
a militant in Gaza. The didn't hurt him, but destroyed
the building. Doubt his neighbours have many good things
to say about the Israeli air force. But HAMAS might consider
them good for recruitment...

This kind of approach seems at best futile at worst
self defeating. They could have killed their target and
had several of his neighbours take his place.
