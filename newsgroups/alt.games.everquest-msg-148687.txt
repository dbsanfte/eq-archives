You should probably still be able to solo a bit at 14. That's one way
to get decent loot. Also, if the group won't let you loot, bail on
them and make sure they know why. It should be pretty easy for a
cleric to get another group.

Health bar works for me. Might take a couple of mobs to get a feel for
how fast they each are dropping.

All you can do is offer suggestions. Any time you point out a fault in
someone's play style, you run the risk of offending the thin-skinned.
Just be as diplomatic as possible. If that doesn't work, bid them good
evening and start shouting out for another group.

I have always hated the levels 10 - 18 or so. They seem to take
forever. A lot of people say go to PC as early as 8, but I've never
had any luck before 17 or 18. However, once you're in a group there,
watch the xp fly.
