See, that's the thing.  If the U.S. goes out and plays in the
International realm, people get pissed off and complain that the U.S. is
"meddling" in affairs that aren't their own.  If the U.S. says screw you
and goes into isolationism then people talk about how the U.S. is being
all centric and stuck up and not helping anybody.  No matter what we do,
we "make enemies."  Screw trying to please everyone.  We have to do
what's right for US.  We're gonna make enemies no matter what.
