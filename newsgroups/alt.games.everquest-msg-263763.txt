I'm not convinced it is that much different from the 6:1 fights of EQ.
The reason is tank getting a few AE taunts to hold mobs on themselves.
So in effect you only have to heal one person - the tank. It doesn't
matter that there are one ore a few hundred mobs. The encounter is
designed the way that one tank and a matching healer can stand the dps
this mob can put out. I use mob here for both single mobs and a cluster
of mobs. Add to this that - at least I haven't seen much - crowd control
utilities are quite rare once you engage a cluster of mobs you have
to rely on the ae taunt. And aggro management isn't a eq2 invention.

So my point is even though it looks like you fight more than one mob it
really IS one mob.

If you get adds other than these linked "adds" than thats a complete
different story. But for the linked encounters I can't see it.
