And, if you think 'goddamnyankee' is one word, you're a Texan.  We've 
got three identifiers for yankees. A yankee is someone who lives North 
of the Red River or has moved to Texas from there.  A 'damnyankee' is a 
yankee who moved to Texas and brought his family.  And 'goddamnyankee' 
is a yankee who moved to Texas, brought his family, and his in-laws with'im.

"Welcome to Texas, now go home!"
