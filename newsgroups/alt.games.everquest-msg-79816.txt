OK, briefly... kill lots of lizards in Feeerrrrottt and save the bits, get 
wolf formed in Oggok, do the lizard tail quest with the SK guild until you 
can do the lizard meat quest and shaman dolly quest (I think you need 
something like 4 unstacked lizard tails per faction hit, so that stage 
kinda sucks before you get in with them enough to hand in the other drops). 
Alternatively, kill lots of frogloks (in Guk etc), and make pickled froglok 
to hand in to Chef Dooga. Eventually, you will raise faction  enough with 
Clurg to hand in the stuff for the Stein of Moggok quest. You need to be 
high indifferent (i.e. Clurg will give you the brush off if you've just 
turned indifferent, but you don't have to get all the way to amiable before 
he'll accept the barkeep compendium). Faction skyrockets with the stein 
quest.

You'll get negative Kazon Stormhammer faction (dwarf king), but since the 
king himself seems to be the only mob in the whole of Kaladim on this 
faction, it probably doesn't matter, and you can fix that hit by handing in 
bonechips to Gunlok Jure in the Pally guild if you really care.
