Jazz, it is the fault of the sloppy wizards. They ended up using too
much power, now there is so much of it washing around in the ether that
any old druid can hitch a ride on the cosmic surf. If only wizards had
used some control the druids would stil be grounded, but no they had to
six man mana burn flippy darkpaw just for the overkill.
