As a cleric, I'm always targeting people as I go along my way, keeping
an eye out for anyone who could use a heal. I'm only a level 15, but
hey, every little bit helps, right?

This big ol' barb war runs up to me in NFP and says "I need a heal." 
Before I can even type a response he repeats it.  My response was
"Uh...'PLEASE' maybe?" He responded by moving on. Maybe he was rp, I
don't know.

Some people will deny themselves what they need to avoid having to
offer common courtesy, and I say, whatever. Had I been thinking, I
would have said "Pet get lost". That ALWAYS gets a rise out of them.
