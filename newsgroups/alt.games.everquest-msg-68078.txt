Sony/Verant have merely found a way to make people observe the license
agreement, that's all.  Legally, you should have to do this for ANY
software you use on multiple PCs simultaneously.

It's just like group fees for anything else: fitness clubs, health
insurance (in the US anyway), pool passes, etc. They charge extra for
additional family members' memberships/passes.

I wish I could pay once and use it everywhere I wanted as well. 
However, there is really no justification for complaint. It's the EULA
to which we agree, and it's the way it's supposed to work.
