FD skill fails less at 200.

Mend is the same 100+, once you get it to 100
you can forget about trying to skill up on it and
just hit it when you need it. One thing to note is Mend
heals 25% of your current hps. This includes item hp
and buff hp. So the more hp you have the more mend heals.

FD only gets faster with AA skills.
Same with mend.
