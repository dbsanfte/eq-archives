The only thing the heads are interested in is the bottom line. 

And while we all hate downtime, it seems worse than it really is
precisely because it annoys us, and thus stands out in our minds.

Scheduled downtime is a necessary thing in a game like this, and must
simply be accepted. Unscheduled downtime overall amounts to only a few
percent.
