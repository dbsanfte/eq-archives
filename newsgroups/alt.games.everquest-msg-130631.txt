Quite often laws against "hate speach" are anything but impartial
allowing some kinds of "hate speach" but prohibiting others. The
latter to the extent possibly creating a class of people which
are beyond critisism. (Which in the US would be a constitutional
violation.)

> respectable countries do. It's not a question of agreeing or

Plenty of disrespectable countries have (or have had) laws against
"hate speach", typically where the definition of "hate speach"
corresponds well with that of "political opposition".

Can you define "hate" in a way which is objective? Unless you
can do that it's rather difficult to produce a decent law.

What's worst that these people can speak or that they be
silenced and then claim to be some kind of "opressed
minority"?
