I won't go into details 'cause it's boring and I don't remember them anyway.
<g>  BUT....

AC both lowers the chance of being hit (damage avoidance) and lowers the
amount of damage you take (damage mitigation).  But HOW MUCH goes to each
type of protection depends on what class you are.  This part I know is true.

This part may be wrong in parts:

Plate classes:  all tank classes (for sure) AC mostly affects damage
mitigation.  I BELIEVE that bards and clerics are the same.
Chain classes:  no idea
Leather classes: no idea
INT and monks: damage avoidance.
