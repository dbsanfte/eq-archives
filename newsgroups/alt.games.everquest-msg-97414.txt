No, I don't know how to get you to see this, but you HAVEN'T refuted
them. You have attacked them, and denied them, but you haven't refuted
them.

Both.  There are legitimate RP reasons for the spellbook, whether you
like them or not.  You do NOT have to look at the spellbook, but when
you're not looking at it, you don't get the extra mana.  You do get
more mana sitting than standing, so it is up to you to make the
tradeoff.  The idea of CR is being changed and for me, I don't like
how CR is different at certain levels.  If we agree to the suspension
of disbelief required to enjoy the RP aspects of this game, then we
generally want consistancy.  We expect to get better at what we do,
specialize our skills, and have more tools at our disposal.  It
doesn't make any sense to have dying completely change at an arbitrary
level, ESPECIALLY when it gets much more difficult.

I don't think the changes are minor.  I don't like the changes from an
RP point of view, and I don't like the changes from a gameplay point
of view.  I don't think they will make the lower levels completely
trivial, but I feel that they change the flavor of the game.

Non sequitur.  Nobody was talking about asteroids, and as far as I
know they don't exist in Norrath.  While you may dismiss the slippery
slope argument as invalid, I challenge you to come up with any other
time when as many significant changes have been made in such a short
period of time (excluding directly after release, because bugfixes and
initial tuning are required).  In the past 4 months, Norrath has seen
significant changes to travel, binding, death, resurrection, CR,
experience, levels, death penalties, available characters, faction,
and just about everything else.  These huge changes have come shortly
after the departure of many of the people who were responsible for
making EQ what it is.  Not all of these changes are bad, and in fact I
find most of them positive, but I think the rapid rate of change,
combined with a perceived need to make the game 'easier' is going to
significantly reduce the appeal for the current userbase.

In what way is this a non-sequitur?  We are discussing the merits of
these very changes, including how the perceived difficulty of EQ keeps
certain players away.  Nobody really 'likes' the spellbook, but we
like that it is a feature in the game.  We like it more than we like
having the game overrun by kids.  You evidently don't.  Makes sense to
me.

No, Verant did some initial tuning at the time that the FIRST players
were getting to the point where death really was a pain.  I know my
griefer co-workers hated EQ because they couldn't get up to a point
where they could grief easily.  
I started playing about 5 months after release, so I didn't get to
experience the problems with the endless downtime and rollbacks, and I
certainly wouldn't argue that those are good things for a game to
have.  I do think that Everquest is pretty well balanced overall, and
making a large number of wholesale changes in a short period of time
will affect the game.  I am very afraid that the changes will not
stop, and that based on past experience, it certainly appears that
changes are happening MUST more often now than they were previously.
