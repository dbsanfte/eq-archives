At the moment Icepaw War Claw (found in Velks) are one of the best druid 
usable 1hs weapons. True, Runed Falchion have more DMG, but war claws 
are FAST, 9/24 i think it is. They weight 0, so no stamina loss if you 
decide to use 30 min to get 1hs from 0 to ??? by beating up a SG and 
train 1hs on it when it run away.
