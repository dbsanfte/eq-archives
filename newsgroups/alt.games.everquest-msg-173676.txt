Transfers are a mild pita, but still very doable.  You need to camp
the characters within trading distance of one another, a little used
banker makes a very convenient reference as you'll also have access
to the characters banks during the transfer.  Without a keyboard you
can trade, access your inventory and bank, cast spells, mem spells,
change your facing (using mouselook, you do need to have mouselook
enabled for all of this to be useful), target with the mouse, ...
pretty much anything except move or type (you could say "canned" text
via hotkeys).  The only thing I've been able to do with the keyboard
is alt-tab to switch between applications.  Camping is also a mild
pita, there's some goofiness with EQ spawning a task that blanks the
screen during logout from character selection screen seperately from
the login/chat task, so you have to do a bit of alt-tabbing to get to
the server select task and exit the game fully (the screen blank task
is killed when you get out).  To camp you just hit the left-most
window-select button which brings up the alt-M window which has sit
and camp on it.  Hope this helps.
