    As some of you might know, I'm all about the chat.  Pretty much, the
chatter is the fun thing about an MMORPG for me.  If I wanted perfect
silence in which to play I would be playing some single player game rather
than dealing with some of the inherent shortfalls of the gameplay in a
MMORPG.  Thus, when EQL introduced serverwide chat channels, I was pretty
much in heaven (another venue to send mistells to!  Alright!)  In EQII I've
been just wandering around and trying to learn the basic game mechanics,
but one thing that strikes is how quite it seems to be.  I _need_ some
serverwide action!  And I think that I've learned enough of the basic
gameplay down to start fiddling with my chat controls. 

   So, is there an "official" serverwide chat channel for EQII?  It was
suggested on other thread by Graeme that we use eq.serverwide.age:age, and
if that works (he says it does!) then I think this is a pretty logical
channel to use.  If there is another, more established channel, though, I'd
rather use that one.  So, does anyone have any thoughts on this?  I put the
only channel I've heard in in my Monster Sig, but I can easily change this
if I am corrected.

  And has anyone figured out a way for EQII folk to join the EQL
serverwide.age:age chat channel?  /crosses fingers!  Tell me and that will
go in my sig as well.
