I need to experiment more with parsings in there then, I didnt really pay
attention to the mobs mitigation, I just sorted by DPS and pasted the last 3
in here (1 of which being the disced damage)

SoV and VoG stacks with all rangers self-buffs right?  If so, SoV is a nice
extra whack of ATK that would of boosted your dps even more so.

Oh I agree.  Note, even tho using fangs/GMU I always had primal up

So far in my PoP groups I've seen no problem at all with archery in exp
groups.  Maybe 1 mob got walled in the whole night (in HoH), which was kinda
mute anyway, the ranger was using melee

Sure the wall limitations, lack of minimum damage etc means it isn't always
optimal.. but I don't have the option of spending 48 aa points for any kind
of ungodly damage booster (163 aa's and I still don't have anything that
comes close to comparing..)

What about thunderbolt with avater up?  This one interests me, because the
bow is FAR more obtainable than primal (or any of the melee weapons used for
comparison)
