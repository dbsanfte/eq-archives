This choker?:

Choker of Majdd  +4 AC +5 Int +0.10 Wt   See Invisible

LOL 2k for that? No way. The see invisible is nice
but there are a lot of items with that on it. And the stats
are not that great. This item is worth 100-200pp at most.

Only way I could see this go for 2k would be on a PvP
server.
