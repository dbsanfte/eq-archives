"Hail Friends! We apologize but the Character Transfer service
is temporarily down for maintenance. We are hoping to bring it
back Online shortly.
Many requests have been received and we are processing them
as quickly as possible, but because of the volume, some character
transfers may take up to three weeks to complete.
Thank you for your continued support.

-The EverQuest Team"


LOL it seems even with the high price a lot of people
are taking advantage of the transfers.
