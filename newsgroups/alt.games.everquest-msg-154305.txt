Me and a friend were partnering at KFC today when someone /ooc'd when
Quillmane had last been killed, and my friend /ooc'd '5 minutes ago' -
'who killed him?' the /oocer asked and my friend answered 'you're
talking to him'.  The guy didn't say a thing to either of us, mind
you.  High level mage.  Me and the friend were both around 30.

About a half hour later the guild leader sends my friend a tell and
apparently, this mage bitched our GL out because my friend killed
Quillmane and "he's not even a mage".  I asked if the GL was mad and
my friend said "yeah I think he is".

Now, maybe I'm missing something, but I'm sure I've seen quite a few
people in here post about killing Quill to get the cloak just because
it's got perma-lev.  Am I wrong?  Is this a "look-but-don't-touch"
kind of mob?  I'm fairly pissed off to begin with that he didn't even
have the guts to say anything to us but just went off and tried to
make trouble.

Ryou
