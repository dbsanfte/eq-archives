Bah, I'm good! I can hack it! :) Confidence I've got. Knowledge of the 
event may be lacking, however. :)

So we're up to 2 encs, 3 offtanks and a druid/shaman for the CC group.

Well, if they have different names, that'd be a bloody good way to tell.

Right.  Offtanks with their weapons bagged.  Got it. :)

The question is more, given our low numbers lately and the large 
contingent of the guild that refuses to set foot in Ssra for any reason, 
is it even worth trying if we can only get 2-2.5 groups?  Even if we have 
a tank with umptyjillion hitpoints?
