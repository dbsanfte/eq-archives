Good morning,  

I would appreciate any help.  I am a low level character so I'm
farming pelt and silk and trying to sell in the bazaar.
I have priced everything just a little below the average- but other
than that- am I just stuck hoping.  Is there any other type of
marketing that can be done.

Any other suggestions on how you make a trader work would be
appreciated.

Thanks

Armin
