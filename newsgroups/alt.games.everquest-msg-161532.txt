A couple of searches here failed to answer my question specifically. I
understand that multiple bards singing the clarity song or the healing
song will stack effects, thereby increasing the benefit. My question
is, since these songs pulse every 6 seconds or so while being sung,
can you increase the effect by stopping and starting the same song
every time it pulses to get a pulse every four seconds or so instead?
