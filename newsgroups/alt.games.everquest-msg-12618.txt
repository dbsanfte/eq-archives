Nope.

Con something that is white, then take off your armor, stand there naked and
con it again.   It will still be white.

Cons are based on level only.   They vary because most mobs spawn in a range.
For example, a Gnoll Reaver in East Karana can be anywhere from level 14 to
17.   Gullerback in Burning Woods /con'ed even to my warrior at 48 yesterday.
The last time we fought him though, he was over 50, since he was able to
summon me repeatedly.
