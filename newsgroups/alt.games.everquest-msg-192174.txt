To my recollection, my human necromancer from Qeynos was not KOS to
those cats.

Yes, and the GLS quest may not work in NK, but I'm not certain.  Check
the faction with Myrsila to see if she's dubious or below.  I do know
she didn't trade GLS's with my agnostic human rogue, but I don't
remember my necro being turned away (it's possible I never did the
quest with my necro).  Just have to see I guess.  There's always SRo
if NK doesn't work.
