Why don't you both get lost? You feel like wasting more space and wasting
more of your o-so-limited time flaming each other? I find most of these
trolls and flamers to claim to have spectacular jobs and unreal information
that they pulled outta their ass thinking someone will fall for it.

Just take your names advice please we are full with trolls ATM, come back
later.
