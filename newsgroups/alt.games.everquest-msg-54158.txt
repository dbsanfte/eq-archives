if I were you, I would stick the 10/29 in primary and 7/28 in secondary,
since your primary will always be hitting more even with dual wield capped,
and the only difference is the 1 dly between the two... oh and the 3 dmg. so
yeah go with that, more damage output.
If I remember right, dual wield works like this...
put a weapon on, every time the delay time comes by, there will be a skill
check, and if succesful then it will fire off the secondary.
