Equally important as absolute 'streakiness' in the RNG from a players 
perception is the actual 'success/fail rates'...

For example, we did an analysis in a P&P session once of just the 
success/fail rolls (ugh and it added a layer of tediousness too :) but 
basically for each roll that simply had a target:

say you need a 15 to succeed... then a 15 is good, and so is a 19, and a 
120. All are simply a success. Anyways we rounded it off a bit, to the 
nearest 5% for each roll (so if you would have needed a 61 it was 
rounded to a 60 etc...)

We found a few people who regularly complained that they 'rolled like 
shit' were actually rolling pretty much bang on... but when they needed 
5's they got 95s, and when they needed 95's they got 88's...basically 
whenever they needed a 'good' roll they'd roll 'almost good enough', and 
when ever they just needed a 5 they'd regularly overkill and roll high 
90s...

the end result being on rolls of 75+ where they should have passed 1/4 
on average, they scored 1/10... but their total average was dead on.

Anyways, the point of all the rambling is that bad timing of the 'good' 
rolls can also 'randomly conspire to screw you'.

In an ideal world, I'd almost want to see the RNG track your 'luck' and 
normalize it periodically, to ensure it doesn't deviate from certain 
limits... and if that means that after failing a combine 6 times in a 
row, the rng monitor steps in and starts boosting the odds of a success 
I can live with that :)  On the other hand if after 30 successes it 
starts weighing me up in favour of a fail... I can live with that too... 
although the more I think about it I'd rather just see the positive spin 
on it. It will only marginally affect the 'economy', and it would 
probably alleviate the frustration of a lot of players.

True randomness isn't all its cracked up to be... sooner or later some 
poor guys going to come along, and fail every combine, every time, for 6 
months straight. (And due to bad timing his average roll, might even be 
right on the money...) but try telling him that its just a little back 
luck. :)
