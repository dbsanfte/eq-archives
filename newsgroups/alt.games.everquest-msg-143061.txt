The ACLU is the American Civil Liberties Union.  Their job is
basically to protect peoples civil liberties.

The NRA is the National Rifle Association, and their job is to protect
peoples 2nd amendment rights, or the right to keep and bear arms.

Both groups, IMHO, go to extremes at times, but they do serve a
purpose.
