In Nov 2003 Sean Kennedy posted the following, which claimed (though
I have no idea if it's true) that it's proportional to "level plus five":

If the above is correct, the High Con Bonus should not be affecting
the OP, since he wasn't fighting stuff level 55+.  If the HCB in fact
applies to, say, a level 50 fighting a level *45* (i.e., a level 50+
player and a mob no more than 5 levels lower), that might explain why
the OP's lower levels weren't getting xp as fast, though shrouding
down to 50 shouldn't change that (not for the better, anyway).
