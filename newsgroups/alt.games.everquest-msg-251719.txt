Compare this to my 63 mage, who normally runs XCG and Elemental Draw, 
for a total of 15 standing mana regen self buffed.  An FT item, say that 
same Solstice Earring, is worth only 6.25% my standing mana.  With KEI 
and Spiritual Purity, and a horse, well, thats what, 2% per FT?

Splendid One, 63 Gnomage with Solstice Earring (yawn)
Llyric, 57 Bard with Solstice Earring (fanfare!)
