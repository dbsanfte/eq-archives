"The easiest way" --- you mean, *your* guilds easiest pull strat.

The likely sacrifice of a cleric in order to pull Dain just doesn't seem
wise to me.. I mean if you have 15 clerics on a Dain raid and 1 who wants to
die anyway to avoid faction anyway.. well its not so bad, we don't have such
cleric luxuries though.

Speaking as a guild who's pharmed the living hell out of dain (about 10 dain
killings per week, on a quiet week!) I'm pretty acustomed with the Dain
pull..

I think regardless of strat, its a shitty pull.  Sometimes Dain just won't
warp (even when he has agro on somebody below).. if hes inc inside 1 minute
or 10minutes is as much luck as anything..  our Dain pull (which is similar
to yours.. and every other strat I guess - except doesn't kill a cleric in
the process)

Monk 1 agros dain, runs him to the front gate.  Along the way he's FD'd to
split off some of the agro (hopefully its just 1 or 2 adds at this point)

Monk 2 takes agro at the gate, and runs Dain onto the ice (above the raid)..
the pair of them play tag with Dain until all adds have gone home.. then the
tagger below (almost always an SK) casts a spell on Dain.. monks FD, hey
presto Dain warps down the ice and hits a tank.

Like I said he doesn't always warp down, if he runs head first into the wall
or onto the bridge, it means hes returning home.. so just re-agro him to the
spot, and get him re-tagged till he warps down (this is no different to him
not warping from a heal)
