I dropped EQ shortly after WoW came out, when I tried to downgrade my
station pass to just EQ2 and Sony told me I had to cancel my account
to do that.  I've missed my enchanter quite a bit so I'm sure I'll
take advantage of the free 21 days.  I don't think I'll be moving
permanently back to EQ, but this may end up being a good move on
Sony's part to re-introduce EQ to former players, particularly now
that the luster of WoW may be wearing off.

As far as the server moves, I'm sure it is automated, but I suspect
that moving an entire server to another server is somewhat different
from a case by case basis.  $75 is probably too high but it clearly
costs them something to process moves. 

Guild Wars has a nice approach to the issue of multiple servers.
There are no "separate worlds" but all the common areas like cities
are instanced.  So you and your buddies just have to agree on which
instance of a particular city you want to meet in.  I'm not saying
that I prefer guild wars (it's sort of an ok single-player game with
some multi-player features) but I like not having to pick one server.
