He didn't look that way when he was down on the rescue site with all those
firefighters and rescue workers - and neither did his audience think so too!

Aha - so you like "rumours" do you?

As any president would.

He was brighter than Al Gore and has the degrees to prove it.

Absolute bullshit - Churchill did indeed "tear up" and on more than one
occasion - as for FDR I don't know maybe the guy just didn't CARE - did that
ever occur to you??.  Over five thousand of his(Bush's) citizens had been
wiped up in one appalling terrorist act - more casualties than were caused
by the attack on Pearl Harbour and you have the *ucking INHUMANITY to blame
him for "tearing up" - what do you want from your president a fucking
ROBOT???

If you want a "tough" leader - try emigrating to Iraq and experience the
inhumanity and fear that goes with the "tough guys" regime!
