Shrug. I've spent all this money on the cds. I may as well play it
for awhile longer.

The only single player thing I've done recently is NWN and Roller

If the adverts and box had said that, I would never have bought the

I've read the faq. I think it needs more detail... but I have read a
number of web sites to. I'm learning. I just don't have hours and

Thats one option I had considered for some time now.

Ihad about 14 'toons and have cut it back to about 8. I was having
ahard time keeping track of which ones had what gear, what was in
their banks, etc.

I signed up in June, 2004. I play on 2 servers. I tried a few
others... but the newbie areas seemed very empty.

I kinda like EQ 1. This is the third mmorpg I've been in. Its the
only one where I was well... chastised for not grouping. The other
two, the players didn't care.
