    Four guilds have killed Emperor on Quellious - Lotus Cult, Vis Maior,
Wraith, Rel In Por. Lotus Cult has pretty much finished with VT, and rarely
goes. VM is usually in VT right after server-up, with Wraith trying to go
every so often. RIP just recently got their first Emperor killing, and is
just gearing up to go.

    What is curious on my server is that there's a guild, Explicit, which
could kill the Emperor and refuses to do so. They don't want to waste time
on farming shards and doing other crap for Vex Thal, so they have ignored
the whole thing. They've been able to kill a lot of PoP stuff with low
numbers, like Agnarr and Saryn, so it doesn't look like it's hurt them yet.
