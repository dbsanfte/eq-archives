From the shadows, the mysterious RojBlake <RojBlake@Liberator.net> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>Every one is entitled to there opinion, everyone.

But only the real loudmouth idiots express it in ooc chatter.

I recall LoIO after kunark was released. Ooc heaven. There was always
some moron blathering on about something. And then of course he'd say
something stupid (it was inevitable) and after taking a pounding one
of the attackers would say something equally stupid causing a backlash
against them. It would go back and forth for hours, days, forever, the
issue changing, the people changing, but the arguing, debating,
namecalling, and posturing staying the same. Then there were those who
just mocked and harrassed both sides equally.

At least in Karnors they had trains to talk about.

Every single person who got involved was (and probably still is) an
idiot. And doubly so for those who thinking talking about how smart
Hitler may have been in zonewide channels was a good idea. I mean, use
some fucking common sense.

It's rather like offtopic discussions in usenet, for that matter.
