"Trade-only" died out long before the bazaar.  Hate created the coffin,
suddenly there was actually something to do with pp.  Other money sinks
were added steadily, and in combination with the steady increase in
the number of "uber" items in the game, especially after Kunark opened,
"Trade-only" disappeared from /auction.  The advent of the bazaar has
pushed things over even further, to the point where most trades only
involve items on one side, but it had nothing at all to do with the
unlamented disappearance of "Trade-only" in /auction.
