Nothing quite like being summoned by some huge badass and then just
sit at its feet while the rest of your guild is being thumped on, is
there? :) I haven't done sit/stand kiting since my low 40s, when I
spent some time in outdoors duos/trios with melee classes in EW and GD
and figured more time spent chasing me was more time not spent hitting
the melee(s) and less mana for me to spend on healing :)
