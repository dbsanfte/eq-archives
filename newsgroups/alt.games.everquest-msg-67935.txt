Actually, it's pretty obvious that it's not a bandwidth problem as
much as a server resource problem.  When I was able to connect to the
patch server on release day I was getting decent transfer speeds, but
I was also timing out and was unable to connect most of the time.
Knowing a LOT more about how sites of this sort are configured, I
fully suspect they had an overloaded load balancer setup that was in
front of overloaded patch servers.
