Either you make them the same enough that the raid gear isn't special or 
you make them different enough that it matters. And if it matters your 
stuck with an impossible to fix 1-group content tuning problem.


No win there.

I proposed that nearly a year ago. I should have patented the idea. :p

What I find most interesting, is that the raid game has gotten much more 
complex since I posted that. Its no longer nearly as true that for the 
most part most raiders can get away with inferior gear.

That was in context that there was a notion that only raiders needed the 
high quality raid gear. I countered that I felt that by and large  group 
players "needed" and benefitted from the raid gear more than raiders 
did.

That gap has certainly narrowed considerably... but even today its 
possible to get gimped through a significant chunk of the raid game 
while doing almost nothing.

That all said... separating raid progression from 1 group progression 
makes sense though, it did then and it still does now, and I'm all for 
it. The 1-group gear should be 95% of the raid gear at each stage of a 
paralel progression. The raid gear however should ramp up in a raid.

Lol... 3 man uber-group looking for a couple gimps to fill some slots to 
reduce the average power-level... I know some 70ths who'd benefit from 
that. :p

Of course, whats to stop me from getting nekkid just before requesting 
the instance... or is the calculator going to rummage through my bank to 
see what i could be wearing...

More importantly...

The real trouble with it is that it really only helps with instanced 
encounters that scale power. I don't much care for those in the first 
place. I'd be sorely disappointed to see it become the dominant system.

So I think this is a bad move too.
