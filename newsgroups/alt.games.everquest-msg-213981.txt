OK, no algorithm for group composition, but saying "by level" doesn't answer the
question.

Group one.  Levels 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40
Group two.  Levels 60, 60, 60, 60
Group three.  Levels 40, 40, 40, 40
Group four.  Levels 35, 40, 40, 40, 40, 45
Group five.  Levels 35, 35, 35, 45, 45, 45
Group six.  Levels 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 45
Group seven.  Levels 35, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45

Using the "levels added" system, 1, 2, 4, and 5 are the same, 7 is highest, 6 is
lower, and 4 is the lowest
Using the "average level" system, 1, 3, 4, and 5 are the same, and 7 is higher,
2 is highest, 6 is lowest
Using the "highest level in the group" system, 1 and 3  are lowest, 4, 5, 6 and
7 next, and 2 is highest
Using the "lowest level in the group" system, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are lowest, 1 and 3
are next, and 3 is highest.
Using "mean level in group" you have 6 lowest, then 1, 3, 4 are next, then 7 and
2 highest and I don't know where 5 falls...if thats even "mean" I'm thinking of

Those aren't the only ways that level could be considered, either, nor are they
the only group compositions with a 10 point spread.  My point is, each method
ranks the various types of groups differently, sometimes radically differently.
