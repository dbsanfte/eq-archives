Sitting is just an animation, it has no effect. You don't heal or regain
power faster.

Crouching is also close to 'useless' but one thing it does is slow you down.
On the Qeynos Predator Class quest you have to go into the customs house and
kill a guy. Problem is you enter the building and there is a blue group
there of a guy and a wolf that mow everyone down. If you sneak and go in
without crouching they see you. If you crouch and move while sneaking they
don't.

I think this means that crouching basically 'hides' you a little bit more,
which in some cases is enough to get by.
