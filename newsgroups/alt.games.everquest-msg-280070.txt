That's just silly.

They do have different games.

And have no one new play it because it *is* EQ, with all the same
flaws.   Unless you're suggesting they move everyone to a new game
as brand new characters and lose all the players who don't move
simply because of the time invested in their characters.

In a sense.  What they really did was create a game which appealed
to a lot of players who *liked* EQ but hated what they saw as
flaws in EQ.   It wasn't ever aimed at the players who keep EQ
going.   I think SOE would have been shocked to see a huge,
permanent migration from EQ to EQ2.   Instead, they got what
they wanted - players who probably would have left EQ went to
EQ2 while players happy with EQ stayed there to support eventual
graphics upgrades, etc.
