> 1) You cannot zone while swimming in the ocean...it must be done on a boat
This is not correct you can zone if you follow the exact corridor that
the boats do. I have done this in OOT when I was sowed and levitating
. I followed the boat right thru the zone and zoned over to BB just
fine. I do admit it was a long while back so perhaps they have changed
the rules. Not sure if it is different from BB-TD.
