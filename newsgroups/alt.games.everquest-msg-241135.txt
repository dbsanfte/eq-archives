My experiences have been mixed.

I have a geforce 4 TI 4200 with 128mb vram

with full clip plane, the bazaar movement was much better.
zoning was markedly faster...

however, targeting was awful
overall, when moving things were laggy/jerky
I kept getting caught on obstacles, like tree roots and corners that I would
normally sail past...  this was especially annoying in outdoor zones.

The starry sky was interesting, but cheesy.
Sunrise in EC was pretty spectacular, except that it really made the trees
look flat and bad...  That will improve when they update the models, I
hope....

so, mixed, but I think it will be fine, once the bugs are worked out....
it's the debugging process that will kill us, I'm afraid...
