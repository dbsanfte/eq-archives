When I play my casters, it's not unusual to med through pulls, med
through half the battle, and only stand to cast a few crucial spells.

When grouping my shadowknight (and ranger and beastlord), I'm meleeing
when there's mobs around and pulling when there's not. I might as well not
have a Meditate skill some nights. KEI or Clarity or even Breeze will
make a big difference.
