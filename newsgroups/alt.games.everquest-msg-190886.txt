You are still very new to the game.   I'd suggest you stock up on ruined
pelts and start on tailoring, that's something I did with my first
character, supplies are cheap and you get armor for next to nothing.  If you
can't afford a sewing kit, there are looms in every newbie city and in a few
other locations too, use them to do your combines. Check maps at
www.eqatlas.com for where to find them.
If you can afford a fishing pole and some bait (the druid can forage bait
sometimes) go into fishing, nice thing to pass time waiting for mana.
If you have the money, pottery is fairly easy to raise and so is brewing.

www.eqtraders.com has alot more info than Caster's Realm.

Most of the tradeskills aren't in high demand until you max them out at 250
and only one skill can be over 200 until you are over level 51 and use AA
points to gain that ability.  Pick one you think you can work up over 200
and concentrate on that.  Still no guarantee you'll make even one PP from
the skill.
Tradeskills are a big time and money sink.  You spend hours farming greens
for supplies, spend thousands on storebought supplies and then you need to
click, click, click to combine them.  You decide if you wanna continue with
them.  Tho, at your level, I'd just forget about them for a while, you are
probably too poor to get very high at any tradeskill.
