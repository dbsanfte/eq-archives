>Kill Fungus Mutant in Guk for drops for copper and gold ring.

The mutant doesn't actually drop the rings.  He drops various types of
mold and fungus that you turn in to one of the kitties in Kerra Ridge
and she gives you either the gold, silver, or copper rings.  Hell,
here is the info cut and pasted from EQMaps (a site well worth the,
what, $12 a YEAR to for a subscription):

"There is also a new quest in Kerra Ridge to obtain the rings Mitty
once dropped. Melixis is a merchant that sells supplies for
shaman-made potions. When you hail her she claims to have three [shiny
tings] that she found all over the world. These shiny tings are [a
dull ring] (the copper ring) a [kinda shiny ring] (the silver ring)
and a [really shiny ring] (the gold ring). 


For the dull ring she wants a bracket mildew. 
For the kinda shiny ring she wants faerix spores. 
For the really shiny ring she wants degenerated guk weed. 

All of these items drop off the Fungus Mutant in Upper Guk."

You don't need the stuff for the silver ring, as that you can still
get that one at the bottom of pool in Blackburrow, but you'll still
need to get the mildew and guk weed for the copper and gold rings.
The mildew is easy to get.  Waiting to get the guk weed can break your
soul.
