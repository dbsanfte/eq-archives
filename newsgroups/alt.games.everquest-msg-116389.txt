I admit it's been a few years since I have used a Mac.  I used to develop
code for embedded systems on a Mac, I found that the Mac was just as
crashprone, as a PC with Windows, despite Macophiles claims to the contrary.
The work I did involved using the Mac, not developing anything to run on the
Mac itself.  The other evil thing about Macs was the lack of shortcut keys
for doing many rudimentary tasks, I was constantly having to take my fingers
off the keyboard to reach over and use the mouse.  I have never used Linux,
so I have no personal opinion to offer there.  I have used Xenix on a PC,
and it was quite decent, but command line interface only.  (This is not a
bad thing from my viewpoint btw).  Xenix was definitely far more stable than
either windows at the time, or MacOS.
