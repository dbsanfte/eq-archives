There are several ruins that people pull to in DL and many people
around for pick-up groups.   Is a very good zone to grind through 40
to 50 if you want.  Karnor's Castle is also right there if you want
to dungeon crawl ( I love that place myself).

Can go to EJ like some one else mentions accept for a few things it
is a decent zone. There is never anyone there to group with (at
least on the server I am on).  I could never find a good place to
kite when I went there (though others may have more info) so I got
way more adds than I could take down with my Necro (fearing) or my
Bard  (would just get tired of running in circles and leave, hehe).
Last the fact that it is a jungle caused me some frame rate problems
(still does) but that may not be a problem for you.
