  Got some vacation time in last week.

  Played less that I wanted to because of an apartment change. I'm
not as young as I used to be; moving across town was exhausting.
May do it again next year, too, if I don't like the commute time or
some other thing about the new apartment.

  When I did get on to EQ, I resolved to dedicate some time to each
of my less-played characters; I wanted them to go somewhere. Also
took some time to fill out my stable, making characters I had been
wanting for some time. Thus far...

  On Drinal Server :

  Visitus, my server-hoppimg frog, will eventually be rerolled here
as a permanent resident with a real name. Managed to get a glimpse
of Monual a couple weeks back PL'ing a friend in Crushbone. /wave
  Also on Drinal I created a kitty bard. Coming from a family of cat
people, I naturally wanted to do a Vah Shir, but was torn between
bard and beastlord, both interesting looking classes. But I don't
really have to choose; I can have them both - on different servers.
The beastlord will go into my last slot on TP; the bard is on Drinal,
as I have no money there, and bards are the best soloists. Fought
his way up to level 3 in the empty moat around Shar Vahl, and sold
the Shadeling Silks he collected for 440pp; got some half-decent gear
and joined groups in CB up to level 7 or so. Ready for more.

  On Firiona Vie:

  Got a little done with Adastra Peraspera. Still at Skyfire ramp in OT,
now level 32.

  On Tholuxe Paells:

  Created that chanter I'd wanted; they are too useful not to have. Se is
Neuveniu's sister, Nuneveiu. As in None-of-you...R'Worthy is her
projected surname. She had a pretty average time of it getting up to level
12 in Blackburrow, then charming things in Paludal Caverns. Getting into
bandit camps was difficult; there was always either someone PL'ing or a
group member above Nun's range. Finally, she managed to get into a
group and up to level 17. Can sell Breeze, but I really need to dedicate
time to her to get her to level 29 and sell C1.
  I spent the most time of the week with Tosev. Knowing the shrooms in
DSP were still dark blue to a 36, and weak-hitting for mobs their level,
I loaded Tosev up with bandages, got a shot of Temperance, and dove
into the shrooms. It worked beautifully: he could clear one shrrom camp
and have health left over to take a couple of zelniaks - small and medium
ones weren't much harder hitting than shrooms. He rocketed up to level 38,
but with the new Hot Spots and some choice LDoNs he won't stay there long.
  Nun's SK sister Neuveniu, encouraged by Tosev's success, tried the same
thing. Worked about as well, though the going is slower, as she can't get
above 50% health without burining mana to drain HP from fleeing mobs,
which dosen't get her to the 75% Tosev's Mend can. Still, she can do the
camp,  or do LDoN's for faster levelling, if she can find one.
  Cleric Celune was created some time ago; I have little time for her, but
can
get groups in CB easily with her. She is level 12, and can support Throne
Room camps, though I'm thinking of taking her to PC to see if she can
get a partner or small group in the upper caverns.
  My long-neglected warrior Gruggoredil finally managed to get to level
41, in a couple of LDoNs where he was the highest level in the party,
and most of the mobs were light blue to him. Hopefully with a party
more centered on his level, he won't be a lost cause.
  Rabotev didn't do much of anything. Except get killed. He is no longer
as good a money-maker as Adas. He can get some grinding in Dulak, but
Adas can get it faster.
  Adastraea Starwind is now level 59. More due to LDoN's than anything else;
once she hit 58, she had no fear of joining them, as she could not be kicked
out to make room for someone too high for her. She is now getting closer to
her guildmates, fighting and dying with them more regularly. She also wasted
a lot of time manipulating the Hollowshade War, trying to get a Preserved
Owlbear Eye. It still eludes her. Axs mana regen is adequate, however, she
will just push on toward BoT.
