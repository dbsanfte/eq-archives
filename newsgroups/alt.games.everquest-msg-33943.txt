Excuse me, but you are being dense and self rightous.

See my other post about "Lytz B'Dolf" and see if there is any way in hell
you want to defend your position on programmers.<That is the dense part if
you haven't realized what the name connotates>

I told you this is an EQ newsgroup and in the gaming hierarchy. You have to
take my comments out of context and place in order to manufacture some
imagined offense.

If we are at a baseball game and I mention baseball players chewing tobacco,
you commenting "Little Leaguers are baseball players too and they don't chew
tobacco" would be so completely anal that people would suggest you seek
professional help.

In your mind. You have made your position clear to me, I just don't think
consider it valid outside of that venue. I have also made my position clear
for the second time and you don't consider it valid. So what? Get over it.

I also discount your level of offense since AFAIK you are not a programmer.
I'm sure they will appreciate you taking offense for them. I hope you get a
Xmas card from them at least.
