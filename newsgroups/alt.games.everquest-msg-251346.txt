Bah, people keep saying that, but it just ain't so.  Enchanters have a 
perfectly serviceable pet.  When I started a new Enchanter recently on 
FiVi I basically used the animation pet to solo up to level 39.

Enchanter pet controls are just different.  Rather than just clicking a 
button to get /pet attack and /pet back off, you have to (a) get hit, and 
(b) mezz the target.

I like my swordy buddy.  Even at level 65 he has uses. :)

Admittedly, a charmed pet is generally more efficient, except that he's 
not nearly as forgiving about suddenly having to go AFK.
