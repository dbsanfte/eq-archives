And, from an EQ standpoint, you are far more likely to be bogged down by
your video card, hard drive, and ram than you processor.  But, in general,
it is my understanding that the AMDs outperform the P4s.  If you take two
processors that are actually running at the same speed, then there is no
comparison at all, the AMD blows away the P4.  This is why AMD is going to
their new model numbers, so they can sell say, a AMD 1300 (1ish GHz) as a
processor that is equivalent to a P4 running at 1.3GHz.  I don't know the
actual model nomenclature off hand, or the actual performance differences,
this was just an example.

As to the system the original is posting about, I'll keep my own.  My
processor is quite a bit slower, but everything else in my system is better.
