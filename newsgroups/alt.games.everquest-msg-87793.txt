 Hopefully it applies to Familiars as well.

 That's not exactly what it says.

 I think they disabled Eye of Zoom in Kedge a long time ago so that
wasn't it. If I had to guess I'd say the Eyes main use was in ToV to
pull Verants idiotic warping mobs. Apparently it's easier to nerf eye
than it is to fix the damn mobs.

 Yeah. No more pulling one and getting 12 because of dumb pathing that
took mobs the opposite way from where you were.

 Yeah I thought the same. In Verant speak 'Entertaining = Corpse
Recovery'. It's already 'interesting' enough with assassins who aggro
from half a zone away.

 Actually this was being used in Ssra to get named without having to
fight your way to different floors and worry about keys etc.  Verant
doesn't care about you getting a few extra normal mobs but when it lets
you get some of their mobs with 'phat lewt' expect a nerf stick to whack
the crap out of it. Not that I disagree with the fix but that's what
makes them 'fix' things faster.
