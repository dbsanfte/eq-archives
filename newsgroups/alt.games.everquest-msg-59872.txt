I'd be willing to bet the problems these sound cards are having is not
so much EQs fault, but the functions of the sound card EQ uses (which
very few other games use but do in fact cause problems and have been
mentioned in other groups).  I dont think they can be fixed with sound
drivers, as there is a problem with the hardware design.   Win2K and
XP use a completely different method of accessing the hardware (HAL)
and the sound cards were probably designed without this as a must work
with feature set.  I know that there are other cards that are having
the problems, but my Intel SE40BX2 with on board sound (Yamaha) does
not have the stutering, but then it doesnt have EAX either.

I would be willing to bet the reason for the suttering and skipping is
all based on the HALs management of the computer resources and how the
drivers interact with it.
