I just started a Vah Shir bard whom I'd like to twink a bit.  Having
played nothing but pure casters up to now, I know next to nothing
about armor and weapons for melee-type characters.  I don't want to
spend too much in case I don't enjoy the bard.

Any suggestions for armor and weapons for a total of about 1k?  (One
of my other characters is a good jeweler so I can handle the jewelry
for the bard separately.)

Thanks!
