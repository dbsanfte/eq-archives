I'll agree with DT here.  I find LOIO much more accessable than
Stonebrunt.  I gave up trying to get through the Warrens after the
third time the L17 Ranger I was trying it with died.  It's not like
he'd have found anybody to group with on the other side, so I couldn't
see any point in further frustration.  Meanwhile, I've made the run
from FV to LOIO windmill easily with a naked sub-20 warrior (no SoW).
