I died last night after wandering too close to the skeleton ruins near
surefall glade. Now i'm at level 10 my items stayed on my corpse. How
are you supposed to retrieve them ? The skeletons stay there hovering
over your body. I sat down and memorized my spells, and then waited
for another ten minutes, but the 4 skeletons just stayed there.

How are you supposed to retrieve your gear when the monsters that
killed you just stand there ? Soon as I got near they all attacked me
again and killed me again. The only way I managed to get my stuff back
was to quickly grab it all and start running to the guards. I died 5
times in a row before I got to them.


The spell snare doesn't seem to work %95 of the time. I cast it on a
monster when it's getting low on health, it tells me I have
successfully snared it, yet soon as it get real low it still runs off
at full speed. Though I have seen it work twice so far on giant rats
which seem to just stop in place.

How does bandage self work ? It doesn't seem to heal any damage at
all. Someone told me it only works below %50 health, but even when I
am very low it doesn't heal any damage. When it finishes bandaging I
my health flick up about 20 points, but then it goes straight back
down to where it started.
