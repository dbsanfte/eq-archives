I have a 16th lvl mage and I have the spell Summon Heatstone. It says that
the spell provides a heatstone which has 1 charge of Serpent Sight. How do I
activate it? I've tried right-clicking while wearing it, while it's in
inventory, and while it's on my mousepointer. Nothing results in a spell
effect.

What am I missing?

Thanks for your help.

John
