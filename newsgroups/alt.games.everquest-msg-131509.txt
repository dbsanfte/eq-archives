In a case like this I imagine it would be helpful to define functions to 
be assigned to those extra buttons. In the case of first person shooters, 
you're right, I like it just to be their own mouse3, mouse4, and mouse5. I 
remember my friend had a mouse a while back that gave a limited set of 
functions for those keys so often you'd have to give up some sort of 
keyboard button you're already using in order to make use of the mouse 
button.
