Thanks for the replies.

My necro is 24 so killing guards is not quite his scene yet :).

Interesting what you say about the Vah Shir being lifted from the
barbarians, especially if you add in the fact that their character and
animation models are simply a re-working of the iksars so far as I can see.
I really feel that Verant showed an astonishing lack of imagination here or
simply weren't prepared to invest the time and money into something a little
more original.
