good point, my friend.  I thought about that, but Enchanters have
animations, and as far as I know I can't give commands to an animation.
Unless, of course, Enchanters actually do have pets and I just don't know
it?
I'm confused. hehe.

So, in your opinion, do you think I should get a bunch of +mana gear instead
of trying to find a new weapon?
And, what do "holdables" do, such as the stein?  I suppose I could go to
castersrealm and look it up, but this is more fun.  lol
