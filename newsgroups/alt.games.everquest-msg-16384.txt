Well, if you're 22 and considered kindly in the keep, I would say the basement
there is the place for you, particularly since your'e right in the neighborhood
anyway. You can fight there all the way to well into your 30's should you wish
to.  Don't worry about the bard lady on the steps. If you run past on the right
side of the stairs, she *normally* won't aggro. And if she does, just run back
to the zone. She doesn't hit very hard.  Then you can circle around and zone
back in on the other side.
  For the overthere, just get on the raft in Oasis. It will take you to Ogre
Island in Timorous Deep. Get off when it stops and follow the island wall around
to the right until you come to a dock. The boat will pick you up there and take
you to the outpost in OT. You can get off safely at the docks and go check out
the town, bank, merchants, etc.
