There are some skills you can start now that will help you.  They are
more for fun than profit.  If you have training points to kick start
them, you can try these:

TAILORING:  You can tailor ruined wolf, cat, and bear skins into
patchwork armor.  You'll make about 1 silver selling it to merchants,
more if you can find a player willing to buy it.  Beats getting 8
copper for selling the skin.  After that's trivial, keep doing it for
the money.  If a mage or monk is auctioning for raw silk armor, you
could try.  You'd probably be better off selling you silks at 1pp per
silk to higher level characters trying to learn tailoring.  Combining
2 spider silks into swatches or 2 spiderling silks almost always
succeeds and is trivial around skill 15.  You don't have to spend
points to begin tailoring

FLETCHING:  You can make your own arrows.  If you use a bow a lot,
this will save the cost of buying arrows.  You can also make better
arrows than the stores sell fairly early.  Spend about 5 points to get
it started.

BAKING:  You can combine bread with meats to make sandwiches.  Finding
bread may be a problem.  Once you have acceived a degree of success,
you can begin making stat increasing foods to sell to players.  Player
made food is also light weight and sells to monks fairly easily.  You
don't need foraged foods to bake at early levels.  1 point is all you
need to start it

BREWING:  If you forage constantly and have more than a backpack of
food in the bank, you can try brewing.  You won't make a lot, but
you'll can use up all those vegatables & fruit.  It will save you the
cost of buying another backpack.  You'd probably get more by asking
someone at a brewing barrel if they want to buy your foraged berries,
fruit, veggies, etc.  Ask someone at the oven if they want to buy them
too.

SMITHING:  Verant finally fixed it so tarnished weapons sell for a bit
more than rusty ones.  Sharpening stones cost about 4 copper.  It's a
3 copper loss with success since you use up the stones.  If you ever
have to do a corpse run, you're better off killing a skeleton for a
rusty & sharpening it quicly than using it rusty.  If you enjoy the
trade skill, try it.  Use 1 point to start the skill.

FISHING:  Buy a pole & fish.  Free bait if you forage.  The fish can
be sold to merchants, to players making fish rolls, or to brewers
making fish wine.  If nothing else, fish are food.  Bait cost about 4
copper; fish sell for 1 silver to merchants if I recall correctly.
Poles break.  It's something easily done while waiting for a boat to
arrive or friend to log on.  No points needed to start the skill as I
recall.
