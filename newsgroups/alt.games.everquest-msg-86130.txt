Yeah I thought it was 5 x level plus 5 because that is what I read
somewhere, but the other day my dual wield was at 100 and I was at 15th
level so this does not compute.  I have seen the total caps for skills
listed several places, but never the caps per level.  It must vary by skill
but I have no idea what it is, and have not seen it anywhere.  Anyone???
