Well a further update....

I added the line USETnL=FALSE to my eqclient.ini and i didn't get the
black screen anymore.  One bug I noted though, is that when casting
spells even with /showspelleffects ON, i saw no spell effects.  Still it
beats not being able to play eq at all, and i rarely play with effects
on, just when i want to get an idea which mobs are in my Harmony radius.
