Another classic (and sadly we have a bunch of them in our guild) is the
folks who go on a ton of Kael raids and bust their butts to get max ally
faction with CoV.... then they go quad the dragon loving mobs in CS.

*sigh*

I'm not much of a role player, but I refuse to hunt the wyverns and such
there. I worked forever to get my max ally faction. When I con them so
see what color they are, and I read that "regards you as an ally",
well... I just can't hit the attack key.
