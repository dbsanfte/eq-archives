We'll leave it to professional shrinks to figure out what set off your
little dick waving tangent today, but before you go misleading a bunch
of folks based on your sixty *monk*, I'll make a guess you've never
played a warrior or a cleric before to post fifty, have you?

In the rare cases where it's only two of you, warrior and cleric (no
auxilliarly damage dealer) the warrior will take a lot longer to finish
off the mob than if we had a rogue, monk, or wizard there. Particularly
with Slates ungawdly HP, AC, etc.  So, genius, what's your "strategy"
for the cleric? Let me guess...... "well time Complete Heals", right?
BZZZT. Wrong guess. Complete heal sucks up a full bubble of mana or more
on a 49 cleric and draws a HUGE fucking amount of aggro, often enough to
pull the mob off on the hapless cleric, who will then have to spend even
more mana healing themselves. Celestial heal is a blessing in a case
like that. Not all clerics learn how to use it well, and maybe you've
just never been partnered with a good one, but it's low aggro, keeps
healing you for several rounds while the cleric sits and builds up more
mana, and can often keep up with or exceed the damage that a blue mob
(even Slate) is putting out. Clerical fear isn't an option, so "fear
kiting" is out of the question for a cleric/warrior twosome. I guess
you've played charactes with Fear and ID so long you forget that
sometimes.

I'm sure everyone appreciates your efforts to be helpful and offer
advice, but be sure you've actually played the class before you start
offering it.
