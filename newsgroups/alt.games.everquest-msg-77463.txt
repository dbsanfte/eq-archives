I know this is a pain in the rear but here is a way to get exp and Faction
requires a Druids help. If Pandos will attack you have the Druid Harmonize
Pandos, Hand the muffins to Pandos but don't give yet. Have the Druid cast
invis on you you are now indiff click give, presto exp and the all important
Faction. If you have the ability to sneak you don't need the Druid, just get
behind and Sneak. I have not done this with Pandos but I have raised my Monk
from KOS to amible in OT with the War braids quest.
