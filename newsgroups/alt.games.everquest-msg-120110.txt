So all my pals got this cool EB item from a Katta quest.  I just gotta
have one, right?  As a Cazic Thule worshipping Erudite Necro I am KOS in
Katta.  After talking to a few people and looking around on the Web it's
decided that the thing to do is kill Coterie Vampires in Tenebrous.

Now there's a Vampire quest to get a Feign Death mask, and I'm dubious to
the Vampires, but what the heck?  Feign Death never seems to work for me
anyway.

I first learn that this faction thing is not going to be easy after a day
of killing Vampires, when we evac out of the keep "to see where the zone
safe spot is."  Turns out it is the entrance to Katta, I'm still KOS, and,
well, LOADING, PLEASE WAIT ...

Hmmm.  I'd killed a lot of them Vampires.  Shouldn't still be KOS. Weird.

Two more days of killing Vampires later, Perl tells me that I've killed
206 of them.  There has been no change in my Katta faction (still scowls).
However, I have (of course) managed to destroy my Coterie faction.

Has anyone out there successfully improved the faction of a Cazic Thule
worshipping character with Katta?  If so, how did you do it?  I'm
wondering if it's impossible to get it above scowls.

Thanks,
Z
