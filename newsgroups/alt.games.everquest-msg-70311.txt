Where can I find drinks that last a long time and don't take up as many 
inventory slots? I have 2 backpacks full of fish rolls, give them out to 
friends and guildmates when we are far from town. I want a drink that
last 2x-3x longer than the basic flask of water from about every vendor.
Someone gave me one in Overthere, said it was a "refreshing drink"...
something called a fuzzleguzzle(sp) or something.

I've checked a lot of the eq web pages, I must be overlooking it.

thanks
