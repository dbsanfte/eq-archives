At level 34 having 115 wis isn't good.  At higher levels having more wis
will give you a bigger mana pool, bigger mana pool = more healing and
blasting.  Beside, druids don't fight, they kite :-).....  I would find some
cheap wis items and maybe a  few that have both wis and hp if you're really
worried about low hp. Otherwise work on that wis.
