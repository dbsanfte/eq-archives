I've soloed to 19 as a conjuror. So long as I avoid 'group' mobs, i can
tackle orange mobs. My gear is yellow or orange and many of my spells are
adept 1, if not they are app 4. Mind you i've found my root spell almost
useless. I've just gotten immobilize and am hoping it is a lot more useful
than it's predecessor, as it would make tackling the group mobs more doable.
Some people say they can solo blue grp mobs, but it's never been an option,
and i found warrior types work much better against groups.
