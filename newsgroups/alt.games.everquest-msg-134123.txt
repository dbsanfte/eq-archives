He didn't make up shit, he gave outdated shit for an
answer.  Yes, in this case the sort of shit that would
seriously negatively impact the play of many classes
in the game... but its outdated shit that lots of people
still believe

By bringing it up, mentioning that it may be incorrect but
its the way he has heard it works, he's exposed it to
the light of the compost heap we call AGE, and its
been decomposed into nice healthy fertilizer for the
new soil that is the (vastly improved) pet/exp situation.

Now we got to educate not only the OP, but anyone
else reading the thread, -and- the guy who had the
wrong shit still sitting in his privvy.

Bonus.
