Neither card is going to handle EQ very well, I played with a few different
cards until I determined that a GF4 Ti 4200 64MB was the least nVidia video
card that could handle EQ reasonably well enough that it won't be useless in
6 months, and even then it's pretty slow in the bazaar even with spell
effects off.
