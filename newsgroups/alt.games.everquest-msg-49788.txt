I'm glad you like it. It's really quite a game.

Well, for one thing, I wouldn't choose a wizard. There are other races that
have much more intelligence that would be a better choice, but if you like
roleplaying, go ahead. There are spells for every region you teleport to.
You can make quite a bit of cash doing this.
