Well, you can travel and explore, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're
with someone who's already been there.  The last thing you need is to die
and lose your corpse somewhere that you cant get back to.  In general, if
you want to explore anywhere, you need to gain quite a few levels.

Usually, you do just stand by spawns and attack.  Warriors pull in monsters,
casters nuke them, clerics heal, and thats usually how it goes.  It can be
fun.  Mostly its fun because of advancing, and the ever looming new reward
of skills just a few levels off.  Everquest isnt exactly much of a dynamic
game at all, and most of the quests are quite crap. if you like leveling,
you'll like everquest, if you dont, believe me, it'll get boring.
