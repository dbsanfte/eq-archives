Lots. People to talk to when you're bored at a camp or such, bunch of
friends to help out when you need some backup, guildevents for fun,
guildraids for fun and profit, people you know how they play and know how
you play, asking info and knowing you get a truthful answer, helping alts
get started up (not just twink, but also be around to talk to, save your ass
from nasties, etc) and more which I can't think of right now.

I've movelogged to the AB server and am guildless for the past weeks because
VI wouldn't allow guilds (or disbanded them). It's really hard farming
silks, getting people together, do something like getting Velious tooths,
etc. without some people to talk to or help out.

It simply makes the experience 200% more rich.
