OK These Guys suck they go around Farming other guilds for members and
then have the nerve  to brag about it. They have no morals and they
openly say so, by bragging about farming, just a buch of lame asses in
my opinon. They did try to recruit me and even offered to make me an
officer , no thanks I'm happy in Shadowstormers.

I just want your take on subject.
