After reading this yesterday I thought "Wow!  What are chances of THAT
happening?"  well...

Joined a pickup group in Karnors Castle last night, and low and behold the
Captain's walkway was uncamped =)  Jade mace here i come !  fighting
commenced for about three hours with a couple of deaths - Druid thought
nothing of bringing back a train when he went off to get his Clarity fix -
but no sign of the Captain.  When one time we got more adds than we could
handle and the Shaman dropped the rest of made a strategic withdrawl to the
zoneline.  I zoned into DL with about 250 hps ( I know I know...wimp!)  When
we go back in the bridge folk used our departure to pull the
captain...ggrrr.  Ah well, it's late (this morning, actually) so I declare
campage.  the Duid says he has to go port the Enchanter whose been
'cracking' him this evening and he splits.  Me and the bard both run across
the bridge to camp in the entry area when my screen locks up.  Odd;  I get
lag-locks on occasion, but this looks like a...yep....You have entered West
Commons.  the little mushroom-stomper hadn't left our group to port, just
invited the 'chanter.  He did Levitate me, and took me back to DL ;  a SOW
and Camo would have been nice too, though.
