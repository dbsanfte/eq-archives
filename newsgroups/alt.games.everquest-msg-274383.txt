Well...

Here's the actual conversation in guild chat.

Me: I just soloed that bastard Lord Androus.  It felt good to get him back 
after all the deaths he caused me.
Pompous Guild Leader: HEY!
Me: What?
PGL: This is a family guild...
Me: bite me :p

I really thought she was kidding at this point. I mean 'bastard'? Is that 
really what she's upset about??

Now in private tell

PGL: You are SO out of here
Me: Why?
PGL: You know why...

So she tosses me out of guild.

This guild was described as an adult guild when I joined.  There is constant 
sexual innuendo chat which no one seems to mind.
But she tosses me for saying 'bastard'...It's her guild and she makes the 
rules, but c'mon...bastard???

28 Fury looking for new guild on Toxuilla :)
