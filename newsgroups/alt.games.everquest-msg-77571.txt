I have a lvl 27 monk that I am lvling with a lvl 35 druid. I plan on using
the monk to lvl the druid up. My question is that I have a 51 necro. I want
to lvl the monk as fast as possible. Would the Monk/Necro thing be way
faster? I know it would be somewhat faster since I wouldn't be lvling the
necro with the monk.
