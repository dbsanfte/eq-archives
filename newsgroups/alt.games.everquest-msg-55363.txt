Journeyman's Boots are very annoying to get.  I imagine deadly as well, on a
Zek server.

Traveler's Boots are sold in Solusek's Eye (SolA) in the gnome castle and
should cost you (being a high level good enchanter) 5250p.

JBoots have an instant casting time...you can even cast while running, from
what I hear.
TBoots have a casting time of 1.5 seconds.

Both are the same speed, and slower than SoW.

Or you can buy 525 SoW potions and run faster. :)
