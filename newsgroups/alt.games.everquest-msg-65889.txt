Found what we think is a great deal on what we hope is a good system.

Just wondering if  EQ will run smoothly or if we can anticipate problems.

And since the MoBo has slots for both sdram and ddram, is it worth the money
to switch to DDRam?

All comments welcome.


Athlon 1.6 gig
ECS K7S5A board
(3D PnP sound card and 10/100 LAN integrated to MoBo)
512 sdram (can also switch to DDRam but don't know if it`s worth the money)
Asus 8200 TI 200 Geforce 3 64Mb video card

Thanks in advance
