But say every node is a set, the list of members is {(fish), (wood),
(medicine), (collectable), (metal)} for example. The algorithm could have
the resources appear randomly, then check from the terrain type to see which
of members to choose from. Some zones might only have (collectable) to
choose from but the underlying code might be identical.

I think the game "civilisation" used to do something like that.

I guess the way a hacker would check is to see if removing a collectible
ever increases the number of resource nodes. I know there are hackers
writing programs that can find nodes and harvest automatically so presumably
someone knows the answer. They may be keeping quiet to avoid getting banned
however.
