You do, it's the only way to travel fast. All I want is proper access
to the bazaar and I can't do it without buying at least two software
packages, both expensive. 

Why aren't all the expansions included in a single package and it's
upgraded as more content is added ? The real money is in the monthly
fee so why not make the clients cheap and easy ?

But it's not. I've only been playing for 15 days so I don't know
anything other than as a newbie ranger, but my experiences as a
complete newbie have not been easy. I think EQ could do with a lot of
polishing, as far as newbies go at least.

The clients aren't for some reason. And having to buy at least two of
them to have a decent game experience just doesn't make sense to me
when the real money is in the monthly fee.
