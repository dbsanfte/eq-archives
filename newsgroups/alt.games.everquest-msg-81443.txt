OMG don't tell me there's another sorta Okie on this board! (not originally
from here, as I would guess, you aren't either) Yes, real pizza... that's a
faint memory... and Tastycakes! Oh yeah, baaby! Course, I love NY diner
food, too (which must say something about me, but I'm not sure what!) and oh
god, for shrimp that costs less than my life savings, and crab that isn't
frozen! And lobster! REAL Maine lobster! Now -that- I'd kill for. (or
