56 Ranger / Cleric duo here, can still get exp, just nowhere near as fast as
a proper group, or course we also have the option of fear kiting (ranger
snare, cleric fears).

Try old sebillis when you are a little older, I (56 ranger) can MA there
with no problems, the mobs are pretty weak, but adds could cause you
problems (no snare).  Exp is still very nice at 56 :)

At your current level, the poacher camp in jaggedpine may still be good exp
(just watch out for Yrannick Blackguard, hes a toughy =p ).

As others have said, its totally possible to get to 65 with this duo, or
even solo, its just the amount of time that it would take to do that, that
you need to take into account.
