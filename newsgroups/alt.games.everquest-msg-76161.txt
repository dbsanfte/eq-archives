If TV out and DVD is important to you then go with the Radeon

If gaming (ie EQ) is most important, go with the GeForce. (64mb
memory, T&L support in hardware.)

The Radeon VE does NOT support hardware T&L (transform and lighting).
This forces your CPU to do the calculations, and your system will take
a performance hit. EQ:SoL appears to take advantage of T&L, and 64mb
of memory onboard the video card runs better than 32.

I personally prefer the Radeon cards (Radeon, Radeon LE, Radeon 8500)
for over-all image quality in 2D and 3D. Unfortunately the "VE" is a
crippled version of the Radeon sold at a cheaper price point.

Cheers
