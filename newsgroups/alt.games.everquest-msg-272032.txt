How much of your mana pool does 100 mana represent, 1%?  10%?  50%?

Now ask yourself, how often do you go from FM to OOM in very short 
order, and end up having to run or die?

Then ask yourself how often you find yourself waiting for mana to 
regenerate, or how often you forbear doing something that might speed up 
kills per hour, because you can't afford the mana.

The first is a mana pool issue; mana regen takes time, in the short run 
you really only have the mana in your pool, if your pool is so small you 
are regularly emptying it out, then your pool is too small.  If, on the 
other hand, you've never run out of mana in the pool in a single pull, 
then your pool is larger than you've ever needed.

The second, the question of mana over time, is a regeneration issue; 
whenever you have to wait for mana or skip doing something because it 
will use mana up, then your regeneration is slow; only if you can always 
cast whatever you want, any time you want, are you at a point where more 
mana regen won't help.  If you are asking these questions I'd bet you 
aren't at that point, although believe it or not it is attainable; its 
quite possible to get to a point where you can't cast spells any faster 
than your mana regenerates without getting aggro you don't want, at 
least for some classes.

Slightly off topic, Focus Effects are also very important here, because 
many of them mean spending less mana to do a job, one way or another. 
Spend less mana on a spell, and its like getting both FT and pool at the 
same time; if your spell only costs you 90% of what it "should" (say 90 
mana instead of 100) then its as though your pool is 10% deeper, AND 
your mana regenerates 10% faster.  Focus effects tend to be far easier 
to get than FT.

Back to your original question, I'd say a rough rule of thumb is that 
FT1 is worth about 5% of your mana pool, if not more; if your pool is 
deep its worth 10%, even 15%.  If your pool is very shallow, though, it 
may not be worth much at all; if you can't cast enough spells in short 
order to get thru a mob, then your mana regen rate won't matter at all, 
because you'll be dead.  Oddly, the lower your level the more the FT is 
worth, because your spells cost much less, so regenerating the mana 
spent takes a lot less time, Plus, you're only eligible for relatively 
small mana regen spells.  With KEI or better, plus BAOR, beastlord buff, 
some MC and so on, you won't even notice FT1.  But when you're running 
Breeze, that FT will add half again to your standing mana regen!
