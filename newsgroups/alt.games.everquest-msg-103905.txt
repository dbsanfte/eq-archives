Nice system!  I too have an Athlon/WinXP system and I had the sound
issues as well.  Go into the Performance tab and turn "Sound Acceleration"
off and the stuttering will go away.  The problem is, though, that other
games want acceleration on (like RTCW, which has delayed sounds if accel.
is off).  But, for EQ, turning that off will fix the stuttering.
