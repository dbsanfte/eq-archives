Completely False Im afraid to say. At 34 I could quad kite with my druid.
Like Lance said, you round them up with an ensnare, then basically circle
the mobs. This gets them in a tight formation, and then you just start
laying waste to them with Lightning Strikes.

Admittedly Viarra is no expert at quad kiting, but shes done her share of it
out in Marus Seru on the Stonegrabbers.
