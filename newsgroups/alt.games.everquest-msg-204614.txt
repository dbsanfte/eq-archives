I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but on Druzzil Ro at least,
the RM Giants don't drop nearly as well as the used to.

The other night I killed about twenty and only one dropped double digit PP.
The average was two or three PP, and at least a third dropped no PP at all,
just G,S,C, and the usual odd loot.
