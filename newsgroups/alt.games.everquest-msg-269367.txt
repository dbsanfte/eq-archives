If you're talking about EQ1, there are certain NPCs that can do this,
for example the Guides in Gukta.  Most NPCs do not have this capability.
You just have to find the right one.

Or, in most city-type zones, you can use the "Find" command to achieve the
same effect.

If you're talking about EQ2, then I dunno.
