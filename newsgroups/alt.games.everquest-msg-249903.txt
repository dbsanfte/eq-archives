The problem is the fox is guarding the chicken coop. Smedly is in charge, and
he's the f**k who thinks maximisation of profit over customer care is what
its all about. I know, this isnt a charity, a business has to make a profit
right? Well, that taken to extremes is what gets you marvels like 'planned
obsolesence' where your products are deliberately designed to fall to bits
so you buy a newer shinier version. What faith can you have that Smedly is
going to listen to a word and take it in, rather than simply see what the
cheapest veneer he can plaster over EQ to screw a few more dollars out is?

Theres a difference between an artisan, a craftsman, who charges a premium
for a quality product, and a short term profit maximiser. I dont think
SOE understand that difference, and I dont think they *want* to. Expensive
slow growth and customer loyalty just dont fit the model.

Smedly strikes me as a gamer who has progressed from the computer game to
the business game; a monty haul player who sees it all about being at the
top again, rating that success by points, maximising income, while 
forgetting why 'we' pay in the first place. Or why I do, anyway.

Wow, Ranty matt ;) And, I guess, a totally unfair extrapolation from a very
slim set of facts. But its how I feel, really. I'll be playing vanguard
when it comes out, I just dont believe in Everquest any more. For a fantasy
world, lack of belief... well, that just seems fatal to me.

Hey. Maybe if I've totally misinterpreted things he'll be able to take things
like Wolfsheads posts to people to say 'look, you're killing the golden
goose'. That would be nice.

Well, I found some words. They're somewhere in between the 'ARGGGGH!' I
started with and the 'BASTARDSSSS!' I ended with. See if you can fish
em out ;)
