They probably did.  They screwed around with the series so much that
it's like they decided to kill it before they aired it.  They skipped
airing the first 2 episodes, and I think they skipped some of the
others, so I wouldn't be surprised if they moved it around as well.

I loved the show on TV but when I bought the series and watched it in
order, all the episodes, I was even more impressed.  I still can't
believe that they were crazy enough to give up on it after a few
shows.
