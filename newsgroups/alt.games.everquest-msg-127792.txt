    All the faction you need in Shadow Haven is available to your character
with a press of a button, so I'm not surprised it doesn't impress you. ;-)
For a tradeskiller, SH is the promised land. One zone, every trade skill
item that's vendor-sold is on a vendor somewhere in the city. The only thing
I'd like to see added is the mage research components vendor so I wouldn't
have to catch the Nexus down to GFay and visit Ak'Anon when I want to make
Celestial Essences.

    A lot of it is unnecessary. I can't think of anything off the top of my
head that raises one faction in Katta and lowers another that isn't Nathyn -
that place could have been set to two factions, Regular and Nathyn, without
losing any of the plot. As it is anyone who can talk to Drenic Garrison can
raise their Magus faction to max Ally, so not much point to having that as a
separate faction. And is ANYBODY non-KOS to any of the Ssra factions, or the
Saphrophyte one, or the Sun Lord one? And if not, and there's no way to
raise them, what's the point?

    It gets worse when you're max ally/max scowls, and the "maxed out"
message makes the faction hit text wrap. Scrolling back to see if you got a
killshot should NOT be required! But at least the factions in Seru make some
sense from a plotline perspective.
