I love my courier, I got 2 back when I ran my bbs (I paid like 300 bucks for
mine apiece) ahh those were the days. If my cable modem goes down the
courier still functions and the little led's still make me happy when
everything connects and it reminds me of old times (L.O.R.D. talking to my
users, the sysop would like a word with you,) thanks for the trip down
memory lane Lok
