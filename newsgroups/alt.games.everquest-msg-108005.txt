Placed in the entry hall of the Hole:

"You'll find some nifty gems in here.
You might collect a stack.
Just don't jump off the ledge below
Or you won't be able to come back!"
Barda Shave

Placed along the side of the tunnel leading into Grieg's End:

"Be careful with that ax, Eugene.  [1]
You're facing a new kind of danger.
You may think you're chopping up a mob,
But it might be your best friend's Ranger!"
Barda Shave

[1] Bonus points for identifying that mildly obscure song reference
without looking it up via a web search.
