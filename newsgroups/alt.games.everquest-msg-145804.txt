You may be in one of the lower tiers of what many refer to as a "family
guild" which is very nice if you're not a 24/7 raiding type. I'm in one
myself, though it's predominantly 50+. However, if your guild doesn't
have others of your level to group with, sad though it is to say, it may
be time to move on if you're ready to move into the post fifty game.

If your guild doesn't have people of your level to group with online
when you are, you wont' even get keys to most (though not all) and you
won't be able to fight in them. Examples are:

The Hole: You're at a perfect level to start fighting there. And it's
one you can get a key for on your own. It's got one of the highest ZEM's
in the game so advancement can be fast, and you can *buy* a key in
Paineel just by getting your heretic faction high enough, which you can
do in the Warrens in a night or two. However, even the entry is death by
yourself. And deeper in past the dropoff, you will HAVE TO have a good,
solid group of dungeon experienced, capable players who know how to
handle themselves to not only survive, but to avoid a VERY nasty CR and
possible loss of a fully dressed corpse without proper backup and
friends.

Old Sebilis: Pound for pound one of the best loot zones in the game and
great fun. But you'll need friends to kill the named frogs in TT that
drop the compoenents for the key quest, and more of them to group in
there. (If you can find a camp open.)

Howling Stones: Best dungeon in the game, IMHO. Death for all but solid
groups of experienced dungeoneers. The key quest can also be a pain.

Dragon Necropolis: See Howling Stones. Also Outstanding, but in
addition, you need good CoV faction which you usually need a
guild/friends to even get.

There's more, but you probably get the point.

Yes. If you spent all your time there, then you are close to a "three
zoner". That's the folks who leveled fast in outdoor zones and never
spent any time in any zones along the way where you often die, death is
on the line, rewards and risks are great, and you really learn how to
flex your class's abilities to the fullest and die a lot learning them.

This is mostly dungeons, but even some outdoor zones. There are places
outdoors with noplace to run or hide where you have to have a group
living by their wits or dying a lot. Places even like Erud's Crossing at
very low levels, later on Ocean of Tears and Tim Deep. No zone lines to
run to, etc. etc. Everyone learns to handle an emergency without just
training everyone at the zone line or relying on massive zerg numbers.
The three zoners simply don't learn these things. We did a bunch of our
early twenties in Najena, (a zone that is simply hell if you never spent
time there), much of the late thirties in Tower of Frozen Shadows
(simply outstanding dungeon) and mid forties in City of Mist. (Another
great place you could *still* get xp in.) These are zones where you
could seriously learn your craft and often die trying. :-)  But they
prepare you well for the really tough shit ahead.

The early life of the chanter is very hard, as newbies have no clue how
to work with chanters, nor how vital they will be later. You have to
train your friends how to work with you and make you useful to the best
extent. If you do, later on you will be their lifeblood.

Get thee to the dungeons, my friend, and find people that can play the
tough part of the game early. They're the ones who will cover your ass
in really ugly dungeons later on. And that's where the loot, the money,
and the real fun is to be found.
