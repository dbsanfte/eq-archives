I think its generally accepted even by those of us who are claiming that 
the random dispells are a 'current' phenomena. Have you been dispelled 
by frog wizard in guk within the last couple years ? :)

We should assume SOE is changing things on us. And we should assume old 
data should be considered unreliable.

As others have noted, as I was about to suggest myself, AOE dispels may 
be treated differently than other ones, or perhaps its certain proc 
dispells vs cast spells... or... or...

Yeah i realize that doesn't line up with your DoN experience.

But the fact is, your experience doesn't match mine, especially in the 
last several months. I'm also in the habit of always having my clickies 
up top...(because it USED to work) but for the last several months it 
hasn't helped in many many places I've gone.

I get "randomly" dispelled so often the game hiccup theory doesn't sound 
adequate. That said, I should spend some time analyzing if its always 
the same slots that get nailed first in any given zone session.

Its too bad we can't rely on player dispels to gather data.

I'm going to drag a couple alts to skyfire today and fool around I won't 
be able to get well rounded data, but chromodracs do dispell with 
freakish regularity... not sure if they're on my 'sequential' or 
'random' dispell category... but if its random I might be able to get 
some data.
