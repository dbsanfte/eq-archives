Stormguard.  Give up on the faction in my opinion it wasn't worth it,
however i made sure i had gather shadows in my inventory when i traveled
to Faydewar with my erudite necro.  I also didn't go until 6, had a
large bag filled with bread and a large bag filled with water.  At
dubious you can bank, no one will try to kill you, but nobody will sell
to you in kelethin/felwithe.  You can however sell at the druid rings in
both butcherblock and Steamfont.  Once you are level 8, cast gather
shadows, and you can head in to the necro guild in Akanon.  you should
be amiable to them.  You can buy the spells you need etc.  Once you get
bind affinity, you can give up on the continent for awhile, and go
slaughter Sisters of Erollisi in Ocean of Tears.  Good money and
experience, but you will drop below dubious to the guards/warrior guild
in Felwithe/Kelethin.  If you group Unrest is also a good place to head
at 12.  It used to be easy to raise stormguard, prior to the changes to
runnyeye.  After they revamped runnyeye, they dropped stormguard off of
the goblins in Butcherblock, leaving you with just Krag chicks and the
rare elders to be able to kill for faction, outside of the orcs, which
will lower your indigo brotherhood faction.
