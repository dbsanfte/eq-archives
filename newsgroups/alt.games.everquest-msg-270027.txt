The way I see it, the only solution, albeit flawed and partial, to the 
problem of persistence in online worlds is to take a cumulative approach. 
For example, if Emperor Crush gets killed a number of times within a 
short period, he gets replaced by a Steward of the Orcs, and then 
eventually by another, thougher Emperor, by a different name. If a zone 
has a scripted War event, like the ones in Luclin, and players tend to 
favour a faction over another (because of loot, or because it's easier, 
or whatever) then *eventually* one of the factions will drive the other 
out for good. Or maybe, in Velious, if Thurgadin is allowed to fall to 
the giants one time too many, it's repopulated as dungeon full of undead 
and ghosts, and slave dwarf mobs are added to Kael Drakkal.

What I don't think it's realistic to expect in any massively multiplayer 
game, ever, is that if you happen to kill the Emperor, then nobody else 
sees it alive from that point on. Look at how much acrimony there was 
over the Sleeper...
