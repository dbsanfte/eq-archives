I'm a big fan of SKs and pallys and certainly wouldn't turn one down
for a main tank in LDoN.  In my (pretty limited) LDoN experience, snap
agro isn't nearly as big a deal it was on PoP. Feign Pulling isn't
important (on normal difficulty) and pally pacify becomes useless as
you approach lvl 65. I've done two assasinate missions now, one was
trivial with a SK tanking, the only time he got under 80% hitpoints
was when he ate the initial harmtouch. The other one was against a
cleric mob that went through a 64 warrior (after defensive wore off,
npc complete heal is 'the suck' <g> ) and a 65 paladin. I ended up
tanking for the last 5% of that fight.  That was what made me decide
to put a warrior in my 'perfect' group.

Well, since my main is a shaman, I have to have one in my perfect
group! :p

 I like having a backup healer and in LDoN I'd rather have a shaman
slowing and dropping Quiessence on the group during a bad pull while
the cleric concentrates on the real healing as opposed to a chanter
slowing and mezzing. Plus, even with a bit worse slow, a shaman is
gonna squeeze more DPS out of a melee or pet than an enchanter can.
Either one should work well though. If anything, I'd replace the
shaman with a bard before an enchanter.

Yeah, I think they did a pretty good job of tuning the dungeons to a
wide range of group combinations. I think they skewed things a bit too
far in favor of high DPS but then again, there's a lot of DPS classes
out there looking for groups.
