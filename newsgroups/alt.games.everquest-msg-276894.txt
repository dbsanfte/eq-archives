Yes, but that's civil liability for lawsuits, which is different from 
criminal liability for homicide. To be honest, I'm not familiar with that 
California legislation but here's how I would analyze what probably happened 
(anyone with more accurate info, please chime in). Prior to the legislation 
you reference, you might shoot an intruder in your home and incur no 
criminal liabiity (because of the common law rule stated above regarding 
home intruders) and yet still be sued for damages by the intruder under a 
civil theory which allowed the use of deadly force only when the homeowner 
had a reasonable belief that there was a threat of imminent physical danger. 
Thus, if you caught the neighbor's unarmed 16 year-old kid breaking into 
your home to steal a girly magazine out of your closet, you could shoot him 
and raise a successful defense against homicide charges, but still be sued 
in a civil court for damages because it wasn't a reasonable use of force. 
What that California legislation appears to have accomplished was to create 
a new presumption in civil courts that an intruder is presumed armed and 
dangerous, rendering the shooter's actions inherently reasonable and giving 
him a shield from civil liability.

As far as I know, it's still the general rule everywhere that the use of 
deadly force to protect property will give rise to criminal liability except 
in the home intruder situation. If there are exceptions to this (as wharf 
rat suggests there are in Texas), I'm not aware of them. Even in Texas, I'd 
be surprised.
