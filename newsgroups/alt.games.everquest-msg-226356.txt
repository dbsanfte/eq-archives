I grouped with a bard yesterday in a POJ exit group who had a gamepad 
setup and made decent use out of it.  He had a LOT of combos programmed. 
  Thing is, just as you'd think, he wasn't good at exactly what you'd 
expect; being reliable.  Missed notes, rapid changes in battle, he 
couldn't handle.  What he was was a melee bard; running combinations of 
melee and caster buffs while doing melee damage.  And I never saw more 
than three things running at once.  He was proud to say he had a setup 
for 3 chants where he just had to run circles and switch targets 
occaisionally.

Splendid One, 54 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
LLyric, 57 Bardage, Morell Thule

He -was- juggling on occaision, said that it was easy since he didn't 
have to do the twisting part
