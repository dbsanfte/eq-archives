Looking into joining a guild and this is the loot system:


To win loot on raids, all persons attending are to send the ML a tell 
when something that drops is an upgrade for them. The ML assigns a 
number to the each person in order of who sends tells first. When all 
tells are in the ML then lists who sent tells with their number so all 
can see then does a random roll, 1 - Total Number Interested. The winner 
is the person with the matching number.


ie. Bob, Nancy and George all want the item that just dropped so they 
send tells to the ML in that order. Bob is 1, Nancy is 2 and George is 
3. ML tells the raid this then does a roll /random 1 3. If a 2 turns up 
then Nancy has just become the proud new owner of the item etc....


If no one at raid can use a dropped item it is then a) randomed to 
anyone at raid that wants it or b) put in guild bank if not no drop if 
no one wants it or c) left to rot if a no drop item and no one wants it.


Special arrangements will be made on those items we go after for 
specific people and will be announced prior to raid start.
=============================================================
Man how simple is that?  Almost suggests the guild consists of a bunch 
of adults who are going to be trusted to put in their names on a fair basis.

Or that the guild leader is hopelessly naive.
