    Well, see, I've been getting alot of those "enlarge you wang" emails
lately.  Three inches here, two inches there, it adds up after a while.  Or
not.  But I don't think it really is wise to discuss the state of my, or
Lenny's, genitalia on the usenet in any detail.  Never know when I might
run for President or something twenty years from now, and fall prey to a
through googling.

   It wouldn't be wise for me to do that either.  I do have a spell
checker, and I use it often.  But I am sure that there are times that I
forget, or times when it simply doesn't know what word I was aiming for and
suggests the wrong one which I incorrectly select as being true.  Glass
houses and all that.
