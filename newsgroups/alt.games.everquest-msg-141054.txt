I know, 90% of you aren't on Ragefire List servers, and those
that are are probably still on servers with other details to
the rules.  So this is largely a rant without a target.

Ragefire pops sometime yesterday night.  He is observed
early in the morning (no way to know how long he's been
up, likely not all that long but who knows) and the spotter
takes a screen shot with him and the time.  Then we
wait.

We've got number three cleric on the list, number two
hasn't been seen in ages, and number one plays only
occaisionally.  So we start to talk about forming up.
At about two and a quarter hours from sighting,  number
one cleric comes online.  Oh well, we think, thats
what the three hour wait is for, its hers.  Her guild
starts popping in zone, forming up a raid party.  We
tell them what the pop time was so they know where
their deadline is.  We start looking around for other
things to do, since we've got a small raid worth of
people in zone anyway, but we also want to keep an
eye on the kill to see if they wipe.

Fifteen minutes before the deadline, they pull.  With
what looks like 9 people in their guild plus a couple
more unguilded, all in the low to mid 50s.  They wipe
slowly but surely, dropping one after the other, as I
watch with my spyglass/debuff preventer from outside
normal visual range.

With no rez stick, there's no way they are going to
recover within the three hour limit, and besides they
really didn't come even close to killing.

Suddenly, for reasons I'm not clear on, our MA is
pulling the dragon, close enough to me to have me
resist a roar.  He pulls over to our raid force, which
rapidly (as in I get one CHeal off) drops the dragon.
Its still 10 minutes before the three hours is up.

We had a report in the raid channel that we were told
to go ahead.  That seems to have been false, though.

There was certainly no way they could have killed that
dragon within the time limit.

One story circulated is that the dragon despawns if
not engaged in a certain time span.  I've never heard
this, but if so would make engaging him very reasonable.

Since the mob dropped within the three hour limit, we
ended up conceding the heart to the list cleric.  Our
cleric is now number two... and realistically number one
since the real number two seems to have vanished from
the face of Norrath.

For the sake of arguement, though, and because this
is the third RF in the past couple weeks I've seen come
down to (or past) the three hour limit and go FFA,
whats the deal?

Does the dragon form of RF despawn if not engaged?
How long does that take?
