   I guess I've just been lucky.  One of my best friends on Drinal was a
wizard, and I got along with her famously.  She and my necro would hunt
together.  But she would full burn, and die alot.  I always felt like it
was my fault, but I didn't want to tell her how to play her character (I
know, I should have spoken up).  
   As a cleric on FV, there have a been a couple of times when I
couldn't keep the wizard alive.  One of them hinted that this stood as
testament to my failure to be a good cleric.  I take my job seriously,
and this was upsetting.
  So yeah, I have baggage on this issue.  Not wizards in general fault,
I know.  Yes, a bad enchanter could be worse.  But I haven't grouped
with any bad ones yet.  A bad puller could be worse.  But Lenny usually
pulls, and I am watching him in RL when he does.  I was a very good
puller when I had the job on Drinal, and I keep him from screwing up too
badly too many times.  And cleric... well, I am the cleric.  And I don't
think I'm bad at it, regardless of what that wizard thought.  
   I'm sure there are people who are as wary of, say, shaman, as I am of
wizards, due to the luck of the draw.
