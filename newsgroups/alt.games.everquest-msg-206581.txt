Well, I did this to 16, and then again today to 17 with the new spells.

Whats different?  Well, I have Breeze, so mana regen isn't quite as 
craptacular as it was till here.  Breeze is more noticable on your feet 
than sitting, of course.  I also have Quickness, the first Haste, plus a 
better pet.

So now its breeze me, quickness pet, pull with slow.. and essentially 
the same layout as above.  I keep Quickness memmed as it wears out all 
too quickly even with extended enhancement.  On the other hand, breezed, 
this plan kept me up enough on mana that I was constantly fighting, 
given that in Kurns I was now facing mobs ranging cyan to dark blue (and 
fondly remembering when they ranged dark blue to red). 

Then I spent an hour in POK chain casting spells on my pet; abjuration 
from 8 to 90, conjuration from 8 to 51.  My Divination and Evocation are 
still under 10, only Channelling and Alteration were maxed thru natural 
usage.  I'll probably go get more exp before I do this again, it gets 
-very- old  -very- quickly.  In fact, if I wait till hitting 20, I can 
be simultaneously working on the specializations while working on the 
underlying skills, 50 specialize is a small but persistant savings for 
each skill.

Thinking about that, what skill would you advise for the main 
specialization area for an enchanter?  Which is to say, in the long run, 
where does most of the mana a chanter spends go?  Using my current play 
style there's no doubt that alteration will go over the line first if I 
allow it to do so naturally...

Matte, 17 chanter, Morel Thule

ps switched to Netscape 7.1 after a couple years hanging on to 4.7 for 
dear life, if this post looks screwy feel free to tell me about it
