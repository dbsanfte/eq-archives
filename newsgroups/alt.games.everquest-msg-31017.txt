A simple little piece of advice/suggestion for tanks ... or anyone that
wants a cleric symbol spell cast on them.

Carry around the components for the symbol spells you want clerics to cast
on you.

When you group with a cleric, give them a private tell and ask them which
symbol spells they have.  Below is the spells and their buff, level, and
components.

Symbol of Transal.
Buff: 34-73 HP
Level: 14
Component: Cats Eye Agate

Symbol of Ryltan
Buff: up to 158 HP
Level: 24
Component: Bloodstone

Symbol of Pinzarn
Buff: up to 307 HP
Level: 34
Component: Jasper

Symbol of Naltron
Buff: up to 525 HP
Level: 44
Component: Peridot

Symbol of Marzin
Buff: up to 700 HP
Level: 54
Component: 2 Peridots

Naltron's Mark (group symbol spell)
Buff: up to 520 HP
Level: 58
Component: 1 Peridot

If you have the necessary components, give them to the cleric and ask that
they cast it on you.  You can give it to them one at a time or in a stack.
Depends how long you think you'll be in the group and how fast you want the
recast to be.  If you give them more than one component, tell the cleric
that you'll let them know when it has worn off so they can recast it on you
again.  These are mana sucks so don't expect to receive one during combat.
I always give back any unused component when I or the tank leaves the group,
but don't expect this to be the case with all clerics.

If you do the above, you'll have clerics wanting to group with you and
getting their groups to pick you over another tank or whatever class you
are.

Best of luck!

P.S.  Lately, as a cleric, I've stopped carrying the components for symbol
spells.  I simply tell tanks that ask for one that I ran out of the
components.  The good tanks then give me the components.  The great tanks do
what I outlined above ... i.e., never asked me to cast a symbol spell on
them in the first place but in private asked me which symbol spells I do
have, give me the components, and tell me how they'd like them given out.
The BELOVED tanks give me twice as many and tell me to cast one on myself as
the same time I do them.  All BELOVED tanks have said the same thing: Cleric
survive, I survive.

Now I used to stock up on the components, but they seem more headache then
they're worth.  And money isn't really the issue ... solely.  Once you cast
it on one member of your party, all members of your party want one and get
upset and whine when they don't get one.  When I tell them the tank gave me
the component so to cast it on them, that shuts off all such whining.  Then
there are tanks in groups without clerics or soloing that ask you to give
them symbols spells.  Most offer to pay, but it is still a mana suck thus
slows my group down and rarely do they offer more than it cost you to buy
the component.  Easier to just tell them that I'm out of the components.
Only once did I have a tank come up to me with the component and pay (nicely
as a matter of fact) for it to be cast on him.  I'm also at the level (34th)
where the auto-split is now commonly turned off and I thus mainly group for
XP ... so I really only make money when I win a /random.  I hate FFA and the
bitching that results ... thus just group for XP and meditate instead of
loot to speed things up.  However, once in a while, I'm with a BELOVED tank
that makes sure I get my fair (and sometimes more than fair) share of the
loot.  I guess I haven't gotten to the level where Group Leader / Master
(when GL isn't a tank) looting is commonly done yet.  However, I'm hoping to
make it to 39th relatively soon and look at that first XP rez and the
subsequent ones as my real money-maker from then on.
