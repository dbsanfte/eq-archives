The difficulty with quests is scaling them.  Killing beasts scales.  What I
mean by that is that they can give beasts more HP and better attacks, and
give high level players more power, so that fighting beasts continues to
work all the way up to high level.

With quests, they run out of ways to keep them interesting.  Consider, for
example, the common "fedex" task (deliver something to NPC X for NPC Y to
earn a reward).  How do you dress that kind of quest up to keep it
interesting from level 1 to level 70?  You can put X or Y in difficult or
dangrous places...so you have to fight beasts to reach them, but then you
are back to essentially killing bigger beasts.

Same for quests of the form "kill mob X for NPC Y", and for most other kinds
of quest.

So, what it comes down to for quests really is story.  The fedex tasks and
kill tasks and other kinds of tasks need to have interesting stories behind
them...and they'd need thousands of them.  That's a hell of a lot of
writing!

An example of how this can be done is "sidekicks" in CoH.  Basically, if
someone is more than 5(?) levels below you, you can invite them into your
group as your sidekick, and then, as long as they are in the same general
area as you, they get a boost to combat abilities (e.g., in "to hit"
calculations) and their powers get a boost, so that they basically operate
as if they were near your level.  They don't get more HP (I believe), and
they don't get any new powers, so they aren't as effective as a real person
near your level, but they can hit the mobs and use their powers effectively
on them (or use things like healing powers effectively on the group).  I
believe the XP is scaled so that they get about as much as they would if
they were in a group of their level, fighting mobs of the same relative
level (e.g., if the group is fighting yellows, they get about as much XP as
if they had been in a group of their level fighting yellows).

There's also something like this in DAoC.
