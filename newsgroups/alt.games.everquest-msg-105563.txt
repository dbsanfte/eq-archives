I just re-read the article several times and, while he may be wrong, he's
clearly saying you are NOT attacking 40% faster with a 40% haste item but
that your damage output is 40% higher.

To be honest, with all the conflicting information, I don't have an opinion
either way about it.  Unless I see hard proof from my own experiments or
from Verant, I'm like Switzerland here; filled with chocolate.  No wait, I
mean neutral.  Also, since I'm not interested in running any experiments,
I'll be annoying skeptical for now.
