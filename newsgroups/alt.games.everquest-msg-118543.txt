Grettings adventures,

As the 8500LE seems to be the best bang for buck i would like to
know how well it runs with EQ.

I have hear it has better visual quality , what does this mean exactly ?

I have also head its comaparable with a 4400ti , how good is that ?

Are there problems with drivers or has that all been fixed ?

If anyone could help me out with this descicion before i shell out
my hard earned cash i would be gratefull.

Cheers
