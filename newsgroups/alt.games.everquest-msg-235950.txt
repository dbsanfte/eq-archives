When I finally realized I would be able to afford a mount, I went to Befallen
and did the 'Free Horse' thing.  Got my free pony and used him once in Gunthak
to solo near the warehouse.  I noticed that his head made it a bit of a pain to
target, but all in all thought I could deal with it.  (I play in First Person
btw)  

Sooo...  I scraped all my coppers together and eventually had the 8.5k or
whatever to buy the tan horse (Gotta up your Cha so this is the minimum you
have to pay) and happily plunked down my plat for him.

After 2 months of use I got VERY sick of 'shooting between his ears'.  Sold him
back and got a Drog.  I love my Drog.  No head in the way, cool looking
graphic, etc.

There are also some rumors that the different color Drogs have special
properties.  I think we have discussed that in this NG in fact...  The Black
one supposedly lowers the chance of the rider getting aggro.  The White one I
think is rumored to help your stamina...  Dunno about the Green or the Red.

Hope that was somehow helpful...  :)
