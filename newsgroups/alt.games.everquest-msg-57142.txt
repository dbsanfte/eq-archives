> Hi Folks.

Hello,

i'm french and we get the same problem with AOL France a few months ago.
However french customers were so upset by this method that they gathered
into an association and get AOL to the tribunal. The "unlimited access" AOL
was claiming in their ads was judged "false claim" since customers were
prompted to deconnect every 45 mn and so they lost and had to remove this
"feature".
In fact AOL France never mentioned beforehand that they disconnect people
every 45 mn, it was added as a result of the huge success of their offer
(the only one with unlimited access at this time in France).
here in France the cost of communication is like in UK, so every serious
online gamer get a cable/ADSL connection.
