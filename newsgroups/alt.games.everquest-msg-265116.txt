I don't see a reason to enact legislation against what is basically a 
virus problem. The recent flood of spam is generated by virus-infected 
computers and relies on spoofed headers so as to not be tracked down.  I 
am surprised that ISPs just let this go on. They should not send outbound 
mail with other ISP's headers.

There is too much legislation in the world.  Far too much.  Thanks to the 
flood of legislation, we are all criminals. Whenever legislation can be 
avoided, it should.
