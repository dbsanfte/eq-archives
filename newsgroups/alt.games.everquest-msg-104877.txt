Had this discussion in guild chat yesterday.

Guildie_01: what's the haste on a FBSS?
Guildie_02: 21%
Guildie_03: 17%
Guildie_01: Huh? which is it?
Me:both - 21% increase in attacks per minute, 17% decrease in Delay.
Guildie_02: WTF are you talking about?  You're a mage, since when
do they know anything about haste?
Me:Do the math
Me:Nasty fight - You've got time.
(long silence while we take a Rock golem and 2 crusaders)
Guildie_02:?
Me:Ok, if something speeds you up by 21%, then your new delay
is 100/121 * Weapon Delay.  Note that 100/121 is about 83%, a
17% reduction.
Guildie_02: umm, whatever.


<sigh>
