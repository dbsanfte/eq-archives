Well, I know from being here before that things slow down at the higher 
end of the game, but I don't remember feeling quite this stuck before.

Having hit 58 a  few days ago, I'm now a whopping 2 yellows in to the 
level.  Just can't seem to get it in gear.

LDoN hard is good, worth about 3 blue... unfortunately, finding LDoN 
hard groups is difficult (perhaps thats the Hard part?) as people want 
to win more than they want the better augments, better drops off nameds, 
and better experience; end their experiences tell them that in pickup 
groups, Hard missions are normally fails at our level.  Meanwhile, my 
"regular" group is having trouble recruiting known elements to fill out 
the group (its really only a core warrior/cleric pair, with a long list 
of people that have proven to be good teammates in the past and a strong 
reluctance to try anyone new unless reccomended by one of the team), and 
when we are doing 3 man and 4 man, we don't do hard either.

Soloing, the old reliable "slog thru this level  however long it takes" 
is very slow work, worse than LDoN normal in the places I've tried it. 
Either it takes a significant chunk of my mana bar to kill something, or 
the exp I get off it is very tiny.  POP I can't even touch with my pet 
trying to tank unslowed mobs... and thats the "crap" mobs in tier one 
that yeild poor exp anyway.  So far my best soloing grounds are Velks 
and Dulak... but even in Dulak I have to stay away from the harder ships.

When I put up LFG flag, I get requests for tier one POP and LDoN.  Tier 
one POP requests are -not- for POD Castle or Courtyard, POJ 
Punisher/Enforcer, PON beyond the stream, or POI factory; the exp in 
"normal" POP groups is as bad as in normal LDoN, and five times as 
boring, partially because I've been there done that with other 
characters in the past.

I frequently have a 53 shaman partner available.   The difference this 
makes is astonishing, we can mow thru the mobs on the Dandolak as fast 
as they spawn... but its only dulak and the exp still isnt' all that 
good, especially since I'm splitting it nearly 50/50 with her.  Best exp 
I've gotten with her was going over to the... hmm, forget the name, 
hardest ship, where some of the mobs are clerics.  Anyway, that was 
decent exp, but tricky stuff, and we read up on it, if we manage to 
spawn the captain there we'll be lucky to make it to zone out and 
certainly won't have any chance of enjoying the fruits of our labor. 
Since the Dandolak has  couple nice drops for her and nothing bad can 
happen, thats generally where we stick.

I guess I'm thinking two things here.

One, looking for advice: where can I solo thats better than, or even as 
good as, Dulak and Velks (as good as would at least alleviate the 
boredom); where can I go with that shaman partner if I can pry her off 
the Dandolak (tricky, since it drops about 600pp per trip and a shot at 
a regen BP and some nice legs); where can I look for groups or try to 
talk groups into going?

Two, remarking that I'm spoiled.  LDoN meant I got to skip over some of 
the normal doldrum periods in the late 30s, mid 40s; easy to find a 
group and the exp was always great.  Also, LDoN meant excitement, 
movement... my tolerance for sitting in one place while a puller brings 
the same 6 mobs in one at a time for hours on end is at an all time low. 
  I want to move around, engage different mobs, hope a named is around 
the next corner, worry that we're going to stumble across a difficult 
combination...  Its -possible- to do this in other places, I now "crawl" 
velks rather than pull back to a spot (and man is that easier, cuts the 
moving across skinny and often slippery ramps in half, and eliminates 
most of that moving while engaged... no more running halfway across the 
zone on those things with 3 spiders chasing you), but groups don't seem 
to like that much, and if there are other people in the zone, they tend 
to come cherry pick the rares, which is one reason people camp a single 
spot.

Splendid One, 58 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
