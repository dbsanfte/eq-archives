I've got a similar setup.

1.5 GHz P4
768MB DDR RAM
GeForce 4 MX 440 with 64MB RAM
Windows XP Pro SP1
DSL Internet connection

I enabled all of the high rez models and run in 32-bit color at
1024x768.  I also maximized the video settings like far plane and
that.  The video card can handle it just fine.  At first I had 512MB
RAM and sometimes in some crowded zones like the Plane of Knowledge I
would get hard disk lag.  I added another 256MB of RAM and get no hard
disk lag at all now, not even in Bazaar (although still get major
server lag).  If you notice hard disk lag, hit CTRL-ALT-DEL and see
how much physical memory is committed.  If it's at or near your max,
upgrading will help.  One more tip, enabling zone caching will speed
up the amount of time it takes to zone (the drawback is that it uses
hard disk space).
