I use a Savage 4 and it seems to do just fine.  Make sure that you have the
most
current drivers and Direct X 7a (I think that's the one).  After Verant
updated
some video files a month or so ago, the Savage 4 stopped working.  But if
you updated
all your drivers, it worked again.  Plus I believe they ultimately patched
the problem
in a later patch.

I will say that when I get into large fights with lots of spell effects and
hit messages
that my video lags a lot.  I'm not a computer techie by any means, so I
don't
know if this is video card related or due to other system or connection
issues.
