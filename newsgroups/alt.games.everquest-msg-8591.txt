As to mana at higher levels i believe you do get a few songs
that require mana. 
Meditate is a skill that never goes up as a bard, it is
merely included to make scribing of songs faster.  There are
several websites out there with bard info.  A popular one
mentioned recently was eqdiva.com.  There are several others
as well, try everquest.allakhazam.com under classes, I
believe they have some links to bard sites as well.
