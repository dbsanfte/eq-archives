> Does anyone have a way to easily skill up safe fall?

Looking down upon your character (F9) a few times, you initiate your safe
fall and a chance for a skillup when you see your charcter go into a
"falling animation". All the suggestions above work well. I used the Field
of Bone "Pit" in the very beginning and the hills by the orc camps in East
Commons and West Commons when I was trying to get Freeport to like me. The
other day I was in PoKnowledge and working on smithing way way overweight
something like 400 stones with a safe fall of 198. with run3 I just walked
off the 2nd floor taking 130'sh points of damage and what do you know, safe
fall 199! Went back to the bulding to stock up on Ore, fell off again.
BAM..safe fall 200! Lol, go figure
