The exact opposite is true.  Imagine spending six months of full-time work 
online to build up a character that you then sell for what...$5000?  That 
means you can earn $10,000 per year.  Hardly enough to quit your day 
job...unless you're a teenager with too much time on their hands, in which 
case 10k is a sweet chunk of cash!
