Also there is problem with rumer control.  E.G. I was arguing with someone
in the game about how much he wanted for his Winblade.  I was telling him
the stats on the AP were almost as good.  He was saying things like there is
a 200/per hit damage cap on the AP which is completly untrue because I was
hitting 400 fairly often and i wasnt a critical hit.  I remember when I was
using the Argent Defender and I sooo wanted the AP but when I got it it was
somewhat better than the AD but not THAAAAAt much better but there was no
place I could go to realy get a decent comparison.  There are so many rumers
going around eq about lots of issues/items in the game that arnt true at
all.   The more we know the more empowered we will be.  Im not going to buy
a winblade as long as the price is 30k because its just not worth that much
but there are some that will because they dont know better.  Its the hype
thing.
