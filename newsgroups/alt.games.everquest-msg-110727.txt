 Ulump has a static spawn location and from what I've seen doesn't
wander. Main problem with the frogs is that they have a fairly large
number of shaman, so they can heal themselves and run away with sow.
Unless you have someone to snare they're annoying to fight. FV may be an
option near the giants house but I cant recall the level range of the
mobs around there.

 Been awhile since I've been there but I think by 24 Kurns is mostly
green (or possibly light blue). If you want to stay on Kunark the next
logical spot is Ill Omen, at least until you get to 30. Then you can hit
Overthere again or Dalnirs if you can get a few people together. I can't
really recommend Droga though.
