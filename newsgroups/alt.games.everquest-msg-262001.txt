Let me make sure I understand:

1> Put my billing info onto the ENC and CLR accounts.
2> Try to transfer them to my PAL account.
3> If successful, move the ENC and CLR to a new account.

Sony just sez, "No."  Second is that they strip the tag when they move the accounts.

I guess I'll never know until I try.
