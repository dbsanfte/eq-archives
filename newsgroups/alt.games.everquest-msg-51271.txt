Yep, and the monk was soloing giants all day with it. Instant cast,
so no interrupts.

Was funny to see a screen full of just "SoandSo has been
completely healed."

Also, and I'm not 100% about this, but I believe this was
castable on others.  Can you imagine the power leveling
you could do with this? Monk beats something red to death,
Feigns, then stands overwatch to make sure his charge is
ok...by completely healing him 4 million times with no break
for mana :-).
