I'd wait for EQ frontiers for the PS2. It is EQOA PLUS the new
expansion (both are on the frontiers cd, so you get it all) I think it
is out in the fall. Or you could get EQOA and get frontiers later.

The PS2 takes any USB keyboard. I think logitech makes one that has
like a joystick thing on each side too, probably works well. Otherwise
you kind of communicate via canned response buttons or an "onscreen"
click keyboard, i think.

You are sort of right about computer upgrading, it is a bit ridiculous
now. I keep thinking that at some point the hardware will become so
powerful, while the software will become so optimized, that a new
system would be good for five years or so. This never happens.
Meanwhile, console systems are so cheap they are sort of disposeable.
Consoles are just getting into the MMORPG thing.
