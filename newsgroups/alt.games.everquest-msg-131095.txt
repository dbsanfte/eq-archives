Actually all trades are horrible, carpal tunnel inducing time and
money sinks with next to no reward wherin the best things you can make
have nearly non existant drops from creatures then quite green to you
or are gems you have to buy for 2,000 plat.

Jeweler is a pretty good trade for an enchanter, thats it. Problem is
that all the other jeweler enchanters on your server are already doing
it.

Really the only good trade is something with utility and without rare
drops, like fletching for your "ranger elf" to make his own
arrows/bow. Even then its about better to go and adventure instead and
buy them from some other player.
