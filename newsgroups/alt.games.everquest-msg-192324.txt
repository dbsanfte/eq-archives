Personally, I don't think I'd be alone in preferring the latter.  Why
spend three weeks comtemplating that sort of unpleasantness when you
can just deal with it as soon as it comes up?  A game patch, otoh, is
considerably less irritating with notice, you can put other plans in
place.  Bad analogy, I sentence you to three wrist-slaps and an absent-
minded frown.
