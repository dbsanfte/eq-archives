Hmm I might sell stuff on various twinks to afford at least one horse.

Currently I was lucky and I got jboots on both my twinks..:

55 druid in green armor with an epic. Yeah, a horse would 
be neat but is actually SLOWER for her.. so kind of would suck.

38 cleric dark elf in velious armor and jboots. She has jboots now and
the horse I could afford won't be faster than them.

35 female troll in some velious armors like Barbed ringmail, with a
velium Lance (cool looking weapon), moss, wurmslayer, crustacean
plate, ugly as heck sk... hmm I THINK WE HAVE A WINNER!
It already has jboots too.. but something would just be so cool and
hilarious with seeing it thunder across the landscape on a horse with
that huge lance or wurmslayer. If the first one was 9 k and the next
one is like 12 k or 15.. I'd save for the faster one.

Yeah, i know there is a horsie skill possibly for sk and pally but she
won't be 51 for a billion years.

The kitty I intend to make will be a shamaness.. so once again the
horse would be slower than sow eventually.
