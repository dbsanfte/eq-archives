For a 45 druid? You're pretty much stuck buying from newbies (or
merchants) for most of the materials, unless you want to hunt extreme
greens yourself.

I've hunted a LOT of extreme greens in my time. I sympathize with your
plight.

It is for this reason that I consider tailoring to be the hardest of
the trade skills. While many of the trades require looted items at
various points, tailoring requires them throughout the entire range of
skills. 


>A tailor is what I want to be damn it!  :p   help please....

The best advice I can offer you at this point is to seek chemical
assistance. It won't make tailoring easier, but it will dull the pain
a bit :)
