    SK, that was when he was 46, and not twinked at all. Was fear kiting,
and had 3 basic problems:

    1) no hill giants around (uber people killing them before i get to SEE
'em)
    2) when there ARE hill giants around I would often get adds (2 hill
giants or 1 hg and a cyclops which WAS a problem at 46... and a fatal
problem at that)
    3) the loot was more often 1pp or 0pp and some gold than 20+pp

    That's pretty cool but it must get mind numingly dull after thousands of
plat farmed, I was fairly sick of it after taking maybe 1k out of there in 3
trips

    Kool thanks for the figures and honesty.
