It's a fixed percentage of the XP needed for the *previous* level, not the
current level.  This is why, when there were big "hell levels" that it was
very bad to die in the level *after* a hell level.

So, if you current level takes significantly more XP than your previous
level, death will be a smaller percentage XP loss than it was during the
previous level.
