Since I have been playing EQ since March of '00 I just want to thank those
who have been very supportive nd helpful:

Dan Harmon (helped me since level 6}\
Bizbee (I live in the BA too...)
Dark Tyger
Lokari
Hansel and Gretel
MadBomma

There are others, and you know who you are.

I am now level 49 (very close to 50) and have learned much from them.

I also recognize that this world I'm playing in is not mine. It belongs to
the developers at Verant. I feel they are doing an excellent job. Make spits
weigh as much as they might in our reality? More power to 'em. I have never
seen them do anything that would be considered 'unrealistic' or vindicative
in the environment they are trying to create.

My enjoyment from the game is purely social. If my friends aren't on I solo,
or explore. If they are we fight blues and chat about work. I don't belong
to a guild nor do I want to (although the Moment of Clarity and UPS folks
seem nice.)

This NG has become...odd

I just wanted to point out that EQ is a fun game (flawed yes, but not to the
point of traumatic) and hope to see you all in a nasty Vox raid!

BTW - Call me Dude, Bro or Bud and you will be ignored....
