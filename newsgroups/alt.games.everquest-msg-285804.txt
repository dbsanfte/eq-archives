The last time that I had another go at Everquest they had flagged my
account with every expansion except the then current one.  This was
about a year or so ago (I think - when Richard got a number of us to
start again on a new server with rules about avoiding twinking).

Maybe you'll only need to buy the latest expansion or it may be that
the cheapest way is still to buy the Titanium pack.
