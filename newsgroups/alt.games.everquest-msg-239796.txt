   Yeah, we tend to be a contentious bunch.  That's part of our charm.  Well,
some of us.  Some of us are play nice.  Some of use don't.  Some of us wish we
were soaking in a hot tub right now.  Best advise I can give it to make sure
that you don't bring your thinnest skin when you play in this sandbox.

   Aw.  

Anyways... if any of the newsgroup people want to go check out the board that
this is linked from, all you have to do is go to

http://www.erollisimarr.com/forum/

   I tried to register with the forum so I could post from there, but never got
the confirmation email telling me I was a-ok.  Maybe it has to be manually sent
through, I don't know.  Still, from what I could see and do, it looked like a
pretty nifty set up.  Nice looking, and seemed to be easy to read and use.  I've
never really seen anything quite like it, actually.  And I am impressed.

   I dunno.  I tend to think "The more, the merrier" and wouldn't mind seeing
this on more server community boards.  Though I have a feeling that we're going
to get tired of seeing people asking their mods to smack down Dark Tyger and
Bizbee.
