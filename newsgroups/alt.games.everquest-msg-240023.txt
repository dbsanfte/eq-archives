Really, I have no crusade against web forums. I just know what it's meant 
in the past, and I know what my experiences in other web forums have been 
like. Rest assured that most here will receive you well enough though 
some may also be a little quick on the trigger sometimes until they get 
to know you a little. Surely that's to be expected? If not, then I wish 
you the best in your continued search for that utopic segment of society 
you require. ;)
