I'm sorry if I'm causing offence to various people here... but this is one
of my pet bugbears... people leaping to very large conclusions from a
standing start.

*shrug* It's just something that's automatically gonna trigger my /rant mode

Somebody with an axe to grind claims that someone senior at Verant/SOE
called EQ players a bad name... and then other people repeat the story
without checking any of the facts, claiming it to be gospel... just because
THEY are a little pissed at Verant/SOE about something.

Okay, so the facts in THIS case are a little difficult for the average
non-Brit to check... the quote is supposed to be in a UK games mag, and
that's not exactly something your local news-stand carries on a regular
basis... but when even the hyper-text link to the offending article fails to
include the quote, people just accept the idea that Flock really DID 'slag
off' his customers because it fits with their own ideas. Anyone who actually
READ the interview would have also SEEN pictures of Flock... so saying "oh
yeah... she called us a bunch of fucks" just proves how baseless their
information and opinions are.

Verant bashing seems to be taking on a religeous... no make that Religeous
with a capital R... kind of momentum. Some people are prepared to accept
that Verant/SOE hates us as an article of Faith where it doesn't MATTER if
there's real, hard evidence to the contrary.

That's fine by me... I may be an Aetheist, but I've got no problem with what
other people follow as their own personal beliefs. Just don't go shoving
those beliefs in my face claiming they're "The Absolute Truth" because I'll
shoot you down in flames.
