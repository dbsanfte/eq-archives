What really pisses me off is that I  am forced  to play with a
bunch of INcompetent,UNintelligente,greedy,unpolite kewl
doods not  only during the raid but the rest of my playtime
too,because without guild there is no regular raiding.
And why shouldnt I get the same reward with the same
time investment as the average INcompetent,UNintelligente 
,greedy,unpolite raider?
With Ldon they did it right,if I dont like the people I did an
adventure with,I could say bye bye after the adventure and 
never have to play with them again.
Now add some elemental quality gear at the end of the Ldon
loot  table and maybe I  am a happy customer again.
Remember its a game,I play to have fun,and all the idiots in
EQ distract from this and they force me to play with them ?

And on the other hand they are planing SOLO Ldons?
Whats up with that?Am I the only one who sees a contradiction?
Looks to me at SoE the one hand does not know what the other
does.

Really I wish there was a real alternative to EQ,but looking on
the front pages of the game magazines,seeing only war games
and shooters,leads me to the conclusion there is no hope.  :(

What really brings me up is crap like "Battlefield Vietnam",
how the hell can one enjoy a game with this background?
Vietnam brings images of burnt down villages,burning
children,poisoned forests and men to my mind,how can one
be so unsensitive to enjoy this game?
