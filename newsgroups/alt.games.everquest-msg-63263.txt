Kind of shocked this was the only server it happened on, unless it was
the last server that still had the sleeper entombed? I sort of figured
all of the uberguilds would keep milking sleepers until just before
Luclin (and the assumed, "next big thing in uberloot" was about to come
out, then take out the 4th warder.  Anybody here of this happening on
any other servers over the weekend?
