It sounds like you have a firm and accurate grasp on the MMPOG market. Don't
expect SOL to change, expect them to change you. If 14 year olds wanted to
think, they would read a book or do their homework or something. That is the
game programmers target market since intelligent people can play a dumb game
but dummies would be lost in an intelligent game. You have to stick to the
lowest common denominator.

IMHO: Start your own guild. You said you had a 35<?> druid in another post.
The transportation and other benefits may be enough to entice people into
joining. Start reqruiting like minded individuals. If you can find a dozen
people that think like you in the sum of all online games I would be
shocked. It could happen!

Just give it a cute name like Antizems of Norath and don't hang out in PC.
"We do Befallen" could be your guild motto.
