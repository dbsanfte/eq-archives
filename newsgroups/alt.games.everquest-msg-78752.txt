My druid spent a lot of time on the wisp island in Erud's Crossing
during his teens.  I'd be bound on the dock and after dumping a load
of GLS in N. Karana he'd just gate back to the dock and hop on the
boat when it showed.  After is zoned I would just jump on the boat and
swim on over to the island (this was before that goddamned plague
shark grafted itself to the bottom of the boat).  By the time I was in
my late teens, I was easily out pacing the boat.

And trust me, I don't swim NEARLY as a fast as a bard can run.  Hell,
I don't swim as fast as my druid can run all wolfed up, although it's
pretty close.
