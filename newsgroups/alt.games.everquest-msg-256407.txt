Now the named can spawn as any random model but the only illusion I
believe they will cast on PCs is the necro nuke/Skelly illusion.

You know that's what we assumed.  However we had a few Rangers
shooting at him while we kited him unsnared and it seemed that no
matter what, we couldn't do damage.  We ended up using gate potions
and sacrificing a (weaponshield to give us time to get out) Ranger the
first time we tried.  Also, we tried and tried but we could never
snare the bastard, since he seemed to *always* be DAed.  Perhaps he
was bugged or perhaps we were just confused...
