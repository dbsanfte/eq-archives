Yes there's a technique to swapping weapons:

1.  open your inventory screen
2.  left click and hold on your primary weapon
slot until it pops onto the cursor.
3.  click on a hot-key box
4.  Do the same for your secondary slot
5.  Do the same for 2 general inventory slots (this doesn't
work for bags)
6.  Store your 2hb weapon in one of those general slots

Now, to swap a 2hb in for a 1hb and shield - click on the
copy of the secondary slot (pick up the shield) click on
the general slot with your 2hb in it (swap shield for 
2hb weap) now click on the primary slot (swap 2hb for 1hb)
Optional: drop the 1hb into the other open general inventory
slot (if you're afraid of dropping it)

All that said - forget 2hb and H2H.  

1.  going 2hb gives up the stats advantage you get from
having 2 slots (primary and secondary) with items in them.
2.  Since you don't have a damage bonus like melee/hybrids
there is no reason to get a bigger slower weapon - pure ratio
is all that matters.
3.  Your ability to hit mobs is going to fall steadily 
behind their ability to take it.
4.  In your 50's you get a summoned hammer that is worth
using again - but  it does most of it's damage through procs
not actually hitting the mob.
5.  H2H caps even lower than 1hb - you're better off mooning
mobs.
