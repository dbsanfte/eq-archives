Well, you might want to read the rest of this thread where one has
already been posted.  Or you might have wanted to check out the forums
on Test where they have been playing with XML tools for the new UI.
Or you might want to go on past experience, where new information and
tools are available by the time something moves from Test to Live.  In
other words you are not only incorrect, but also rude and flailing
about trying to find some way to blame others for your error.
