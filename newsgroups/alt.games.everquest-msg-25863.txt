Wow, you get clerics to zone at least once to do a rez for you without a
serious mention of payment?

("I can donate, if you want" translates to "uh, I appreciate the time 'n'
all, but not THAT much...but I guess I'd be willing to let you gouge me for
a few plat, but only if you force the issue.")

I don't zone to rez strangers unless they offer me 200p or more up front,
plus help traveling, if needed.  If someone forces me to broach the issue of
payment it just means they're too much trouble.

That said, if you died in the zone I was hunting in and brought the corpse
to me and my mana wasn't committed to something else, I'll do it for free,
whether payment is offered or not.  Since I'm eternally broke I always
accept gifts from strangers though, unless I know that stranger has a high
level cleric alt that I can parlay into helping an alt of mine later. :)
