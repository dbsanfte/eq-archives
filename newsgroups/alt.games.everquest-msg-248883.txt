So I guess you are a "Happy Camper" ?   :)

Remember the time before Ldon? Everyone was complaining
the game is too static,due to sitting all day at the same spot,called
camping too :).
Ldon brought us real "Dungeon crawling",entering a zone 
and clearing it from the top to the bottom,while moving with
the whole group all the time.
Thats pretty close to that,what I expected when I started EQ
in 2000,and so I am *very* happy with Ldon.

I agree with the part PoK ruining (partially) the game,takes a
lot from immersion when you only need to click on a book
or some funny stone to travel somewhere,no feeling of a "world",
makes EQ more like a "Video game".
