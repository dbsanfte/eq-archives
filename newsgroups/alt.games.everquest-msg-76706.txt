It's mostly there, I presume, for shamans, who get IVA at level 14 
but Invisibility not until level 29.

My feline shaman has used it for traversing Hollowshade without worrying
about sonic wolves or owlbears. I have heard but not verified that the
sonic wolves do see through camo/invis. I know that the dire sonic
wolves in Tenebrous do see through IVA.

Sonic wolves are an interesting case with respect to invisibility...
they rely on echolocation rather than vision, like bats. 
I was surprised IVA worked on them in Hollowshade.
