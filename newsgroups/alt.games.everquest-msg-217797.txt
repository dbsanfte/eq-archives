Anyone here use/have used allthenewsgroups.com? Are they any good?

I value the opinions of this group and my ISP (which I work for) is thinking
of switching news feeds, and this is one of the ones that came up. I
personally have never heard of them.

If you've seen this before I apologize, but I didn't see it on my personal,
paid for news service, and our current newsfeed is apparently so screwed up
it never made it out of our little neck of the woods when I posted it on the
ISP's news server.
