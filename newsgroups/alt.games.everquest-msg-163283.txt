Since this group is ver good about its netiquette, that is a fair way
to describe it.

I've seen newsgroups more rigid, though. Where top-posting once gets a
lecture, twice gets you made into a pariah, and if you refuse to
acknolwdge after that, widespread plonking.

And there is no reason to post if no one is listening....

Of course, I agreed with you.

I don't use Outlook either, but from what I have heard it defaults
reply cursor to the top of the text, so the lazy way out is just to
start typing and hit send when done. I have *heard* that Outlook
itself in its help files or somewhere indicates that's just a
convenience and you're still supposed to scroll down to where you want
to reply to, but I can't verify that. Outlook will *never* be on this
computer.
