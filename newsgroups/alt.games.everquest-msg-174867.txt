Gets a bit confusing when you are charming and meleeing. Charm only
requires you to have your prospective pet targetted at the *beginning*
of the song. Just for kicks, I tried twisting in buffs while fighting
and maintaing a charmed pet and it wasn't too tough until I attempted
instrument swapping on just one of the songs.

Needless to say, I'll have to get used to the usage differences. :)
