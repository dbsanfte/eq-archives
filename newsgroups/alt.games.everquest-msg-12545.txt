Take a group, especially melee folks, to Solusek's Eye.  For everything
there you're going to need a high 20 - low 30s, but nowhere does it say you
have to get everything. :)

Solusek's Eye (SolA)

Efreeti - Platinum Armband (retail around 150 on my server)...I forget the
WIS, I think it's 3
Foreman - Foreman's Tunic, I forget the AC, I think it's around 10.  Other
stats are STR/WIS = 3, weight ZERO (very nice item for lowbie monk, btw).
Around 200 on my server.
Gabbie (a gnome) - Molten Cloak...uncommon drop.  She's the hardest one to
get if you have anyone in your group who are KOS to the gnomes and not high
enough to pull her to a safe spot (over by the lava bridge) to fight.  +4
WIS/INT, a very nice item.  I don't know avg retail
