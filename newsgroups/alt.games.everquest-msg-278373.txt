Actually, Wine dances a very fine line with Microsoft; I do believe MS
*is* pursuing Wine and WineX.  Using IE, specifically, with Wine is
considered a violation of the Windows and IE EULA.

dosemu can be used with FreeDOS, a completely free-speech
implementation of the Disk Operating System.  Derived from DRDOS, iirc,
much like MSDOS was, so MS would have no legal legs to stand on in that
case.

dosbox emulates the 80x86 CPU, doesn't it? So they are also free and
clear, seeing as how the reason Intel couldn't go after AMD or Cyrex is
the same reason they can't go after these guys.

Samba implements a compatable network service to the Microsoft Windows
networking services.  As it is developed openly and completely seperate
and without any knowledge of the workings of MS networking protocols
outside those freely observable in the wild, they are also free and
clear of IP and licensing issues.
