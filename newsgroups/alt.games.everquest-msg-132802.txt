I'm not sure I can do that for young'ns, but I can reduce just about
anything to essentials and explain it that way.  I taught the Reactor Plant
to the rest of the ship as part of their Enlisted Surface Warfare Specialist
training.  Teaching nuclear power to airdales.... now that takes some
patience.

Why do I see you coming away with a bunch of Calvin and Hobbes
explainations...

But they lack the tools necessary to do that on a broad scale.  Liberal
education requires a broad base of knowledge as a foundation.  That's why we
teach algebra before calculus (although I think algebra should be taught in
fourth grade, at the latest).
