This is based on the conjecture that to earn Leadership points you must 
be group leader or raid leader.. which would be annoying in that I've 
more than once been group leader only so I could invite people while the 
real leader did other chores, and same for raid leader, AND the 
occaisions (relatively few) where I've run raids myself I've usually 
designated the Raid Leader role out for the same reasons.  I'm busy 
sending tells around and raid says and so forth, I don't want to also be 
in charge of the petty details of inviting, thats called delegating 
authority, and should get me bonus raid leader points!

But whether thats how you get those points is entirely unknown at this 
point, anyway.
