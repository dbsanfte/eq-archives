From the shadows, the mysterious "phil-on-a-hill" <nope@nope.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

alt-enter shifts to windowed mode. shift-alt-r gives windows conrtol
of the mouse (so you can hit minimize). At least, that works for me.

However I've noticed on my computer it doesn't really like having
other programs open with EQ and theres pauses and stuff.

Yeah well it IS EQ we're talking about here.
