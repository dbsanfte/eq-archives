It was kind of discussed in a recent thread but I want all the details...
how much experience does a lvl 41 char need to hit 42, and how much exp do
mobs give, is it according to their level, how do the con colours effect
that?

While we're at it, does anyone know the true effect (mathematically) of
agility on defence? It's clear to me that going from 75agi to 100 means you
get hit a lot less, but more agi than that doesnt seem to do much... wheres
the formula? :)

I'm a strategic/tactical player... i want the maths so i can develop a half
decent strategy here or at least have better information than seat of the
pants "feel" :)

Cheers,
James
