Hey, this maybe rather strange question:

I play now on Lanys T'Vil. And I would like to know what is the lore behind
her (if it's a "she"). And unlike most of Gods and Demi-Gods, I never heard
of her to be present in any zone as a char/mob or even the "essence of the
zone" (like Quellious).
I have a vague memory that she was a child of 2 dragons, sort of like
Kerafim the Sleeper, half fire half ice dragon.

If you know plz let me know or direct me to the links where I can read up on
the lore.

Thanks

Baron Woland, Enchanter of Lanys T'Vil
