What in the hell does empathy for her over the suicide of her son
have to do with ANY other action she may or may not have taken
in her life ?  You apparently dole out your compassion based on a
merit system. Mary is a nice person, so I empathize with her, but
Jane was an asshole so fuck her she couldn't have suffered any pain. 
And you say I have selective empathy ? Piffle.

And I choose to say, big fucking deal about your concern over
such a trivial entity in the overall scheme of things as the EQ
community.
