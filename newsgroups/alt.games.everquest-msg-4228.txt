There will be both a new class and race (confirmed by eq.castersrealm.com).
They've probably decided on the class, but I hope we get a real assassin
(undetectable poison that will kill with one poisoning or a death touch) or
a thief (one that can steal items from players [on the PvP servers at
least]).
