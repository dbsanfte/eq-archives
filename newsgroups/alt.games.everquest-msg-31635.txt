Those weren't reasons, those were categories of names. I thought you
would be intelligent enough to see the difference.

How can something done in private be "indecent"? To be indecent, it
has to be offensive. To be offensive, someone has to be offended. If
all participants are willing, how can they be offended?

It harms others just as much as killstealing and so forth.

You're running the "oral sex" law in increasingly desperate tangents.
Hence, thrashing.

Not that it makes it right for them to break the rules...

WHo said they find them too harsh to follow? They, as they are well
entitled to, feel that their position grants them privileges above the
players.

I never mentioned the EULA in that statement. That was a desperate
dig, Dan.

No, I never have. I've found some of their actions on those policies
unreasonable, but not the policies themselves. The fact that *YOU*
might find some unreasonable does not make *ME* a "Verant ass kisser".
It simply makes me someone who does not share your point of view.

Well, basicly, you came out calling those in support of name reporting
petty and stupid. I merely fired back.
