This is what you're looking for. Hopefully, the special character (hex 012)
shows up in your newsreader and can be copied. I took it out of the Word
document that I created with the instructions. If it doesn't work, let me
know and I can email you the Word doc (from which you can indeed copy the
character).
The following technique can be used to incorporate itemlinks into your
hotkeys, so that  messages can actually contain more information for the
viewer, linkable and unobtrusive, but communicative. Using these links,
players can actually see links to the spells referenced by your messages, so
that they can better understand what you�re actually casting. This
information was pieced together from various sites and experimentation. Most
of the credit goes to Shaman (yay) Gangaskan Gnollbasher on Torv, whose post
on the Crucible site was the first I read on the topic.

Step 1: Make a hotkey and give it a recognizable name, like Linktest. Give
it some kind of /say text like �/say I have SLOWED %t.�

Step 2: In your EQ folder, find the file named
[YourCharacterName]_[ServerName].ini. So, for example, my file was
Winterfury_Firiona.

Step 3: Open the above file in Notepad and find the hotkey you made. You�ll
see the text next to the hotkey that�s labeled by page number, line, etc.
You will be editing this text.

Step 4: Your hotkey will start with some kind of /say or /g, /rs, whatever.
The rest of the text will consist of whatever you would ordinarily put in a
hotkey message, but will include a snazzy new link. The link you will create
consists of four parts:

a) an opening �box� character (hex 0x12);

b) an item code;

c) a label; and

d) a closing �box� character.

The result should look something like this:

/g0026915-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001C7442067 MALOS on ---> %t in 4.3
seconds ...

Note the opening /g makes this a group message. Following this is the
required �box� character which denotes the start of the item link, followed
by the item code, the label (� MALOS�), and finally the end �box�, followed
by the rest of the hotkey message. The text that you put between the last
number of the item code and the closing �box� character (in this case
 �MALOS�) is the label and is the pink text that people will see as a link
in the message.

Step 5: Save As � the file and make SURE that you select UTF-8 encoding in
the bottom drop down. This is the format required to be read by EverQuest
and is the only way that this will work.

Step 6: Once the file is saved you�ll need to reload it into EQ in one of 3
ways: 1) restart EQ; 2) zone; or 3) type /load ui (this is fastest). You can
alt-tab out to edit the file in Notepad, re-enter and just /load ui.

Ok how do you get the item codes and how do you make that little box
character?  Every item in EverQuest has an item code and it�s accessible
using a simple technique. Send a ;t to an item, and EQ will return a message
saying it �Can�t find player xxx�� where xxx� is the item code. Simple, huh?
So, typing ;t followed by a link to an item will get you that item�s item
code. It�s just like sending a tell to someone but sending it to an item
instead of a player.

The box is not so simple, I�m not sure that there is a way to natively
create a hex 0x12 character in Notepad but fortunately you can just copy and
paste it right from the example above. Some forums do not properly display
the box character, which is why I created this document (Word knows how to
print the box).

That does it. Let me know if you have any questions about this technique or
suggested improvements. I get a great variety of responses to these messages
in my groups, ranging from �Ahhh, so THAT�s what Cripple does� to �Wow, your
HAXXORS ROXXORS my BOXXORS�. It�s always neat when a fun technique turns out
to have some nice utility as well.
