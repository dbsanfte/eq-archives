You can't make a hotkey to do it, but you can move both inventory slots and
weapon slots to your hotkey bar.   This allows you to click on your equipped
weapon, move the cursor about an inch, click on the inventory slot with the
weapon to switch the two, then click on the equipped weapon slot to complete
the transfer.   It takes a bit of practice, but it works well enough.


ps, for the most part, people tend not to top-post in this newsgroup.   It
would make your replies a lot easier to read if you did the same. : )
