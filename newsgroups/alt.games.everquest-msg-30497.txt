Seeing how you are only 15 you might get jumped in a few spots along the way
so if you can bring some cash to pay for SoWs along the way, it will make
your job easier as you:

1) get to the gypsy camp in NK and get bound if anyone is around

2) get to HHK (Dan mentioned Highpass Hold as a possible spot to bind - not
sure if it is honestly but you can defintiely do it in HHK)

3) Off to Freeport

Not many other bind opportunities along the way.  And stopping in NK for any
longer then a second to ask for a bind is silly since the EK bridge is a
minute away and EK is much safer than NK any day of the week - especially at
lvl 15.  Shouldn't require more than 2 SoW's either if you want to go
through straight.  Maybe one in Qeynos and another in EK or HHK.
