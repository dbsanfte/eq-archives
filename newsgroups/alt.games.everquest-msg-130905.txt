I've checked around everyplace I know and we never found any use for it.
Heavy as hell and useless to my knowledge. We just destroy them. It's a
pretty common drop.  We had a Hole raid yesterday and got two of them
just while wasting time killing entry mobs before heading in.

(First time I ever made a whole yellow of XP on a raid. Silly raid
leader put my [then] 49 wizzy in a group with a 48 necro, a monk, a
pally, and a warrior. The melee were laying out some fair damage, but
every time I managed to land an Ice Comet on a mob at the same time as
the necro landed two acid blasts..... well, we were getting the xp on
about 3 out of 5 kills and with KEI and unlimited mod rods from my mage
buddy, the downtime was non-existant.)
