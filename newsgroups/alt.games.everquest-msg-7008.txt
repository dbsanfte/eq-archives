Now there's a can of worms.

I started my monk a couple of years ago now. The general consensus
then was to throw everything you could into agility on the grounds you
would get hit less. 

The opinion recently has been that this makes little difference and
that strength and stamina are the way to go.

Personally I can't see a lot of difference between damage normally and
when strength buffed, so I'm not convinced about that, but I do regret
not putting more into stamina. I found out yesterday that a monk three
levels lower than me had the same amount of hit points I did.

Stamina boosting items are a lot less common than strength, or even
agility..

Forget dex by the way, it's useful for getting melee skill raises -
which won't be a problem - and for weapon procs. If you're relying on
the difference in procs then you're doing something wrong.
