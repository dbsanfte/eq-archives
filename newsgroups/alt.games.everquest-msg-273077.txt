My 2nd box cleric is getting hit daily with out of the blue guild and 
group invites And he's not well equipped, well known, nor even high 
level (55).

Scarcity is definately a problem ... a who all cleric 50 60 during prime 
time returned 5 last time. Sure many of them would be anon, and the 
population at 50-60 is getting anemic at the best of times... but 
yeah... I think theres a pretty big demand for clerics right now... 
everywhere.

Grats on your happy server transfer.
