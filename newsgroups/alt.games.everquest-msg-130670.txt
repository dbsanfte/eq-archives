Paul sees what Locust couldn't understand.  Your sources are only useful in
an argument if the other person has any faith in them.

Fox isn't unbiased, they just have "compensating" biases.  Fox has both
liberals and conservatives.  The presence of conservatives, in equal numbers
(not just a token conservative to be thrown to the liberal wolves), is what
makes Fox unusual.

There are some good sources, ie the Washington Times (NOT the Post).  Also,
look for those that put their bias on display, instead of saying they aren't
biased, but really are.  If you can see where they're coming from right up
front, you can usualy pick the fact from opinion.  There's also the Drudge
Report.  He sometimes has some questionable sources, but at least you can
see where he's getting the info from.

Sometimes a good thumbrule, sometimes not.  It's not always the case that
both sides are equally at fault.
