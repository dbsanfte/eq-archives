You just saw this hoax reported as fact in your paper no matter where you live

a hoax. Funny how that works eh?

Woman admits KKK attack a hoax

"Victim" carved initials into her own chest with pair of scissors

By SAMMY ALLEN of the Gazette Staff

LINDEN, Texas--A 32-year-old black woman lied about being abducted and assaulted
by two white men last week, Cass County authorities said Tuesday.

Chief Deputy Ronnie Fincher said the Bivins, Texas, woman also etched the
letters "KKK" into her own chest.

"She admitted it to the FBI agent and one of our deputies," Fincher said Tuesday
afternoon. "She can't give us an answer as to why she did it. Charges are
pending against her."


The woman filed a report Thursday with the sheriff's office claiming two white
men wearing white sheets or pillow cases over their heads had abducted her in a
pickup. She was treated at Atlanta Memorial Hospital for several injuries and
was examined for possible sexual assault.

Fincher said the woman had injuries to her body, but the story she told to back
up her claims was not true.

"It was all fabricated," Fincher said. He said the woman carved the letters KKK
on her chest with a pair of scissors.

Cass County investigators had already voiced doubts about the racial attack
Tuesday morning during the news conference. The FBI agent arrived later in the
day and questioned the woman and witnesses.

"The letters appear to be mirror images--as if someone did them while looking in
a mirror," Fincher said.

Cass County investigator Sgt. Ray Copeland said much time and effort was spent
looking into the woman's claims. "We went door-to-door Friday in the area where
she said she was kidnapped. We notified authorities in the surrounding area with
the description of the truck.

"We've stopped several vehicles fitting that description in the Bivins, Linden
and Atlanta area and identified the drivers."
