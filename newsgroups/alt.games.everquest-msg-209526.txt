I'm not confused, I'm irritated by the whining.

Hmmm, the first that comes to mind is that fabulous game we call
"real life".

That's fine, go do it instead of coming here to whine about it.

That game does not exist anymore.

Do you have any idea how pompous and inane that sounds?

Oh yeah, and your "truth" is, of course, the only possible "truth".

This is the only reasonable thing you state in the entire post.  The
rest of it is ill-thought out rationalizations attempting to claim
superiority for your fun over everybody else's fun.

There, you say it again.  The only possible justification, sufficient
in and of itself.

Now then, the only problem with what you've posted here is your
presumptive position, taken in the "Ranger lvl 12..." thread, that
you have the right to impose your fun on other people.  What's
that you say?  You didn't claim that?  Oh, really?  So, when you
join a pickup group with a character whose gear is horribly gimped
you're not imposing your limitations on them?  You keep equating
reasonable expectations of competence to unreasonable insistence
on extreme twinking, which is complete bullshit.  At the same time
you insist that you should be free to influence other player's
game in a manner that is just as severe as the extreme twinking
that I am NOT advocating.  Once again, I call bullshit.  If you
and you friends want to go off in a corner and tell yourselves
that you're better than anybody else because you won't participate
in the player economy go right ahead, but don't expect other
players to foot the bill for your eccentricities.  Further, once
you've staked out your primitivist RP position, don't you find it
mighty fucking hypocritical to be gaining experience and loot
grouped with characters whose gear allows them (and thus you) to
kill mobs tougher and faster than should be possible?

In summary:  Your complaint is a pile of hypocritical bullshit.
If you want to play differently from other folks because it's more
fun for you, then by all means go do it.  But don't lay out some
pathetic pile of rationalizations for parasiting off other players
and then go whining about how unreasonable they are.
