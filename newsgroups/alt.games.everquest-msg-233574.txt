Well Halflings get a 5% racial experience bonus, and warriors and
rogues also get a class experience bonus, so probably a halfling
warrior or rogue would level the fastest.  Also, Halflings have racial
hide and sneak so a halfling rogue could hide/sneak starting at level
1.  I don't think deity plays a factor into how fast you level, but
will play a factor into where you are or are not KOS (for example,
Brell worshippers are not KOS in The Hole so some people have created
Halfling rogues that worship Brell to do corpse retrievals for The
Hole).

Halflings also have a nice newbie zone (Misty Thicket).

I would think Halfling druid, since druids are a pretty easy class to
play.  And warriors and rogues, though they have the class bonus, are
pretty group dependent, whereas a druid is one of the best soloing
classes, so if you can't find a group right away you can still solo
for experience.  Druids also get some nice spells like SOW and ports
which makes it easy for them to travel, and they can also quad kite
for fast experience in later levels.  

However, there seems to be a stigma attached to Halfling druids since,
due to their racial bonus/easy class to play, they seem to attract a
larger number of idiots than other race/class combos (which is why you
might hear Halflings sometimes referred to as "Asslings"), and which,
of course, isn't fair as you're likely to run across idiots in every
class/race.  (It seems like Iksar monks also have a rather bad rep,
too)
