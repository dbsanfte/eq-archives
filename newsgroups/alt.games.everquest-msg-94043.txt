If you found it on the ground / in the water in a town, it is probably for 
an enchanter spell quest.  If this is what it is, just destroy it unless 
you are an enchanter approaching level 44(?).

Where did you find it?  I'll guess in Qeynos under the flying saucer in 
the water.  We can make a game of this... where do YOU think Peter found 
it?
