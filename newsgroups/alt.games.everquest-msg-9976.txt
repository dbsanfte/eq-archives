There are a lot of rules in English grammar that don't belong there, in that
they didn't evolve with the language.  They were grafted over from Latin,
which was regarded as somehow more "pure" than English, in an attempt to
"refine" the language.

This includes things like the split infinitive ("to boldly go"), and ending
sentences with prepositions.

I don't worry about it.  There are more important things to be concerned
with.
