	Not necessarily -- on Stormhammer, the traders congregated in the Nexus
and Bazaar.  On many of the older standard servers, GFay is the trading zone
-- "GFaymart".

	No, it doesn't.  It just makes the players play someone else's idea of
what their character should be like.  Alignment is an idea that is nearly a
full quarter-century behind the state of the art in RPGs.

	Characters in EQ have a reason to put aside their differences -- they have
all been marked by a higher power (Order) for some special purpose.

	We know what it's like.  We had it inflicted on us already.  IT SUCKS.  It
was (and is) an UNBELIEVABLY bad idea.
