I'd add a shadowknight and a ranger.  The SK can tank just fine (since
you are starting untwinked and won't be doing any PoP mobs soon), and
can FD pull if needed.  The ranger does a lot of damage and has the
sorted track function so usefull in experience groups, were quantity
usually beat quality.  And the SK has a wide pallet of aggro means to
keep the "ranger down" at a minimum.
