that is one thing that VI has fucked up in this game...people have the
ability to take on a camp themselfs simply with 2-3 people rather then we
used to have a full group and rave about a full group xp bonus..this only
does one thing..creates a buncha of people who are lfg 80% of the time
because all the camps are taken by 2-3 people and they see it as "hey we can
take this camp, why invite more, less xp for us". VI needs to implement some
sort of good of a full group over a group consisting of only 2-3 people
making people wanting to fill groups up more.
