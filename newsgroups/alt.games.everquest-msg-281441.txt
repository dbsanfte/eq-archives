Not playable...  hardly.  Even a rogue can solo all the way to 70 in stuff
they pick up along the way.  Unpleasant?  Without a doubt.  What is possible
and what is advisable are two very different things.

I started a paladin the other day because I was bored and had never tried
one.  I am the twinkmeister.  Level 1 paladin, 1800+ hp, a 28/30 1'her that
isn't level limited, a 40/40 2'her that isn't level limited, etc.  Strangely
enough, this doesn't help much at 1-10 due to damage caps, other than simply
making sure he stays alive.  After level 10 is when the twinking really
starts to shine.

Many "hardcore" players will adopt the same attitude with twinks.  We're
used to facing mobs that will kill us in one round, so when we twink we're
more interested in being godlike than being challenged.  Our challenge comes
during the raiding.
