Not so sure about an enchanter. Would you tank, and what would you use to
cut the healing.
Any healing class would work (you forgot druid)
You could also group with a necro. He can fear kite it, so you can melee
without bing hurt.
Bard would word for the same reason, but then youll need an extra set of
hands if youre playing them both.
My pick would be the druid.
