Personally I only put one spell points into stuff to get them started. I was
told when younger to save the skill points for trade skills (Get them up to
20... saves time and sanity when starting a tradeskill) only exception to
this that I would consider is monks mend skill but that's me heh... just
started my own monk recently

SoW is permentally hotkeyed almost by most Druids I know... just because ppl
are always 'SoW Me d00dz'...

Depends greatly on situation... if your solo'in its both... if your in a
group that's melee heavy and no cleric your healer/buffer... heavy caster
group/wcleric you can melee and DD etc... gotta learn the play the
situation... as an enchanter I have 75+ spells right now... I personally use
30+ spells constantly... from breeze, to dd, mez, stun, buffs/debuffs,
etc... can't mem them all so have to decide which ones fits situation

if I'm not mistaken all of them... think each one sells different spells for
different levels... not a druid so couldn't tell ya... once ya hit 19 won't
matter cuz you can self port heh

> 7.  Where is the best place to get gear , buy it, get from quests, or

depends on resources... I'm poor so my best bet for eq is Questing or the
ocassional Drop from Monster... if you have resourses (or hook up from
friend with resourses) I'd say buy them... once you hit 29 you can port for
donations (Or charge like some people) and rake in tons of pp... I think of
makin a druid JUST for that laugh... of course I haven't got my enchanter to
29 (Almost there) so it's not something I could probably do myself

Don't think so... IIRC animals are Cats, wolfs, bears, bats... typical
animals

at level 10 not alot of 'Good' spots... I grew up in Nro and spiders there
gave 2 silks consistently... not sure about karana's spiders
