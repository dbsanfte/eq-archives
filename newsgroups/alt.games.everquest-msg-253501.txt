3k would require some luck on drops.  I average about 1.5k an hour (and
yeah, I've tested it).  If I work at it I can clear 2k an hour, every hour,
if the zone is (fairly) empty.

A couple things that help me.  First, I do generally have another character
sitting in the zone and /split off my money regularly so I don't slow down. 
I never loot any items at all, only coin loot.  I don't bother looting
anything but HGs, though I may loot a cyclops in passing now and then.  And
I use my lowest level nuke (by far fastest casting) to tag mobs, and when
clearing the lizards/basilisks I tag all that I can find in quick succession
and then use AE when they catch me, usually having pet kill a couple more
HGs while I'm doing that.  I don't actually nuke all that much other than to
tag, and the big bolt is overkill.  I load one of the cheaper, faster
conjuration nukes for my DPS spell, but mostly rely on the pet to do the
actual killing.
