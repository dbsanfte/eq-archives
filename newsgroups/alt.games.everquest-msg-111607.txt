I certainly use Immobilize a great deal, although for a while after getting it
it was simply too expensive to use regularly, and even now I often use Root
instead.

Druid/Ranger roots have a DD component which is why they break mez.  This
makes them far less useful at playing "save the chanter." If there are other
root
classes represented designating one of them to do any rooting is a better
option.

Slow takes a lot of mana and quite a while to cast.  It also aggros mobs
pretty good, and I don't just mean during the recent glitch period, even
before that point it annoyed mobs pretty well, and a too early slow is
a leading cause of chanter death.

Root certainly has its uses, but with the reach of some mobs in a confined
space,
those uses have more to do with proximity aggro than anything truely effective.
While I certainly have done my fair share of cleric mez (heal to grab add
attention,
back off, root, back off, atone, go back to group confident the add is gone)
its not something I've done much in many a long level.  If the mob is on me, I
just suck it up, or stun it... at worst I suck it up till I can't take any more
and
then hit DA.  If the mob is on the chanter, I really must be healing, there's no

telling how fast that HP bar is going to dip south, mobs that are slapping the
5K hp tanks for 100 a shot might be doing 450 a hit to the nearly ACless
chanter.  Either way, I'm relying on the chanter to -stick- that mez ASAP, and
perfectly willing to get beat like a red headed stepchild (taking probably 250 a
hit
from my 3K hp total while I wait) if thats what it takes.

When you are being beat on by a red to you melee mob you -failed- to stick
slow to, you might take the time spent Loading to consider that letting the MA
get aggro before trying slows may be a good plan.  Mez casts fast and everyone
in your party is counting on you to stick Mez to the adds ASAP, not to be
playing around with slow in the hopes that that pissed off mob is going to hit
you so slowly that a cleric might be able to keep you alive.

Mem blur/atone  are options you might consider for those mezed mobs that
are next on the hit list.  Flash of Light is an amazingly effective tool in the
battle against chanter aggro.
