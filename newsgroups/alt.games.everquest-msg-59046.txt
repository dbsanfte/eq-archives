  Ah, I see where a little of the confusion is coming from. :)  There's
Aclarity which is a pure Haste spell unlike Augmentation with a better Haste
component, but with no AC/Agi boost and at a greater mana cost... and it
only lasts 11 minutes, less than half the duration of Augmentation/Clarity.

  To me this would seem to be all the more reason to wait for the fight to
begin, or at least wait right before the first pull to cast the spell. :)
