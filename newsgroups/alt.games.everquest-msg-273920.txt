"Pussy cat", in my experience, doesn't mean coward. Gentle,
mischievous, perhaps playful, but not coward.

Nothing narrow minded about temporarily suspending an account when
someone deliberately tries to circumvent the rules.

I know you have difficulty with concepts that others find simple, so
I'll take a moment to explain. Note the venue - This is not a
Blizzard-owned news group. In fact, it's not owned by anyone at all.
By using the word "ass" in my sig, I am not violating any rules. 


>as well as obviously taking a swipe at a lot of people's religion

I'm taking a swipe at a passage which asserts that someone should be
killed for having a different faith.

Your desperate flailing attack on my sig clearly demonstrates that
you've at least started to recognize the flaws in your arguments
supporting the use of the word 'pussy'.
