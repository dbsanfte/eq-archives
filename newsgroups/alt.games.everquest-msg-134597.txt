The way I see it, if someone asks a question and you don't know
the answer - or are unsure you have 4 options.

1.  Keep your mouth shut and see what people with more experience
say.

2.  Say, hmm, I don't know, but you can find out at (give a
couple of links - in this case, eq.castersrealm.com for archived
patch messages, and the 3 class specific boards for the primary
pet classes.)

3.  Say, hmm, I don't know, and I'm really interested in the 
answer, so *I'll* research it and come back with the answers.

4.  Say, hmm, I don't know, but here's a bunch of stuff I vaguely
recall, and half made up - do with it what you will.


1 and 3 are my most common approaches, either I don't know and
am not interested (no answer) or I don't know and am interested
enough to find out for myself.

If you don't believe that's what I do, I invite you to look up
the thread where Jazz was upgrading his video card.  I had *NO*
idea what an NLX motherboard was, so I did some research and 
found out.  And yes, I got a little peeved at folks who kept 
posting misinformation in that thread too.  This happens to be
a big pet peeve of mine, IRL (at work particularly) as well as
in game.
