Have you ever tried to work with the thing they call Visual Basic in
MSWord or Excel?  It says its Vb but I know Vb, Vb is... well not a
friend, but I know it, this is NOT Vb!  I used to complain about a
proprietary language I have to work in that has only a dozen or so
rudimentary commands that require you to get very creative in how you
use them, but that was before Vb showed me that more is not necessarily
better and four different kinds of Vb can only be worse.
