Subject: 2 boxing on a raid

My guild had a raid yesterday.  I was designated a group leader.  In my group
was one of the guild leader's Alts *Robes* who was also playing his Main in the
raid, (I didn't know this until after the fact).  The first mob killed Alt Robe
in two hits.  The second mob killed Alt Robe in two hits.
Since I was clueless, I immediately sent a tell to a high level cleric, who is
also a guild leader,  asking what the HELL *I* was doing wrong, no way could my
fastest heal spell hit Alt Robe before she was dead, both times. HLC/GL
responded that both times the Alt was sitting and that the Main was busy and
hadn't been paying attention and not to worry.  (Shouldn't I have been told of
this arrangement in advance, since I was the cleric?)  After that the Alt
remained standing well out of the way of mobs.  She still died a 3rd time after
her pet died and she got agro - her damn pet shouldn't even have been in there
fighting with no one at the keyboard, IMO.  Finally she was logged out
completely so I didn't have to keep an eye on her, they brought her back in to
loot keys.
I don't think this is fair to me or my other group members.  I shouldn't be
trying to protect an Alt who isn't even at the damn keyboard.  My main concern
should be my tank and the other Real Players.  
Am I right or am I being a self-centered cleric, (again)???
