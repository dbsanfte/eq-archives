Most of the time a "No, sorry" to a low or insulting offer surfices. I don't
trade as much as I used to but I was in EC last night (and on BB's Auction
channel) back to my trading ways, well just selling really.
Anyway, my friends often use me to sell their items. One had the spell
Aegolism for sale but was getting silly offers, he asks me to sell it, tells
me it's worth 6k so try and get close to that if I can. I have seen him
auction and he doesn't add the price, I put it up, 6k asking price, an hour
and a half later I have 6k waiting for him to log in again. I have
successfully sold Aego for him twice at that price. When I sold one for
myself I just asked for 5k for a quick sale and got one in about 20mins.
I still don't understand why people don't add prices, someone selling Club
of Ice Ocean yesterday, I am interested in one of these, ask what price, 7k
is answer, that's a nice price, why not advertise it? Anyway by the time I
had the extra k to get it he had logged (I don't make offers on already low
prices) the next one came up for 8.5k which is about average.

Sample Conversation (actually having 3 at the time but this one was great)
from EC

Wariur (seriously, that was his name, 5th level, no prizes for guessing
class) "Are you trading?"
Me, is auctioning various items inc. a low level BP and sword as well as
some blunts for priest classes "Do you mean am I selling items or am I
willing to take trades for my items?"
Wariur "Yes that's what I mean"
Me "Erm...I gave you two options, what one was it"
Wariur "Thanks, I'll be right there, just need to get my corpse I have some
good stuff to trade"
Now at the time I didn't think anything of this but now I have just repeated
it...what corpse? He's 5th level.
Time goes past, I continue with the other 2 conversations, sell a staff.
Wariur "ok, omw"
I've not told him where I am and he's not asked....after a while I do a /
all and he's not online <shrugs> if he thought I was going to wait or hold
anything he was wrong, not that he actually mentioned any particular item.
