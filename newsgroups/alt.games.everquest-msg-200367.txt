    You'd think so, but no. Do you know how many of those tailoring things
on EQTraders were made by me, just to see the stats? And I have a lenient
GL. If your guild has a bunch of people with hats better than the chain one
(Burrower caps on SHMs, Tormax hats on RNG/ROG) there's no way in hell
you're gonna let the guild tradeskiller waste stuff on a hat. Not when chain
legs, chain BPs, and OMG plate legs and plate BPs are so much in demand. And
the people making stuff for sale in The Bazaar only make legs and BPs
because those are the biggest stat pieces, and that means they'll sell for
the most, right?

    Have someone group with you when you make an attempt. They'll see the
"Meemers has failed to make an X" message, and if X is the item you want,
you know the recipe works.

    Yes. But look at it. If you get one chip of granite, you can't make
anything. If you get two chips of granite, you still can't make anything.
Only once you've got three chips of granite can you even begin to make the
tempers. Tailoring is similar in that it takes three saps to make the curing
agent. But with tailoring, the saps and the silks drop off the same mob.
With smithing, after you've farmed your chips you need to start farming
another mob (muds) for the liquefied earths you need. Double the rare
components required. And then, once you have three chips and four liquefied
earths, you STILL might not have enough tempers to make the piece you want!

    How does your guild give out tradeskill items from raids? Is it part of
the points system? I've seen how other guilds do it, and I'm curious.

    If a regular blue gives 4% AA to the group, a Seeker gives 5% AA. They
hit harder, but don't have significantly more HPs. I'd never seen XP fly by
like it did in the one group I had that could handle them.
