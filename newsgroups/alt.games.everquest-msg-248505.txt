A couple members of our guild have been Elemental -except- for the 
Rydda'Dar HoH trial.  So I don't think you can skip those either. :)
My bestest friend is Elemental except for the other two HoH trials... I 
don't know if she's tried to zone into a plane yet, though.

I'm living proof you can skip Aerin'Darr though.  Of course, I can zone 
into any elemental plane on my own, but can't zone into HoHb without a 
virtual flag.  The occasions on which this has frustrated me have been 
few, however.

Oh.  And you can skip all the Sol Ro minis and still get Plane of Fire 
access for killing Sol Ro himself.
