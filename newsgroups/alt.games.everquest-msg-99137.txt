Oh come on now.  Are you seriously saying that whining on the druid boards 
really carries much weight?  Hell, every class whines on their boards.  There 
are a certain number of players in any class who are just immature little brats, 
and they are going to find something to be unhappy about.  Druids are the most 
played class, generally believed to be one of the easiest classes to play, one 
of the most capable soloing classes, and possess the best utility spells.  It's 
all about balance, you have 4 really, really nice positives, and a downside that 
you're not completely overpowering on endgame raids.  Cry me a river.
I've never known a good druid to have a problem finding raids to attend, but I 
suspect many of the loudest whiners are people who have soloed their entire 
career and now realize they can't get the best gear without a large raid.  It's 
all about risk vs. reward.  You take the easy way for 55 levels, you don't get 
to be the most desired raider.
(None of this is directed at you Ben, I suspect you're as competant as any 
druid.)
