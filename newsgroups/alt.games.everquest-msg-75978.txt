Druid bashing is never off subject, one of the favorites around here. And
Quadding Wyverns in CS is probably the favorite Druid bashing topics. I
guess CS is a little interesting in that the Wyverns never really get that
mad at whoever is killing it if the player has good CoV faction. The Wyvern
will peel away from its attacker if a KOS player gets near it.

I've always advocated that druids are stupid and annoying for kiting at
all - 1 or 4 MOBs. I mean what the hell are they thinking of letting an
aggroed MOB run back and forth. Personally, I think they should just stand
there and tank, after all my 49th level druid has more than 1000 hit points
and a 700AC. With his Dark ember he occasionally hits for over 30 points of
damage - and that is every 3 seconds! With a damage shield, he has actually
managed to melee a 20+ MOB to death.

But having those idiotic druids kiting all over the place - instead of
standing there and fighting like a man, is one thing. What I don't
understand is those soloing tanks who decide that running their MOB over to
me screaming for a heal when they still have a whole bubble of health left!
For crying out loud, I really love it when he has more than one meanie in
tow and they decide to start beating on my group.

And those friggen Necros! Do you believe that they actually send in their
pet to fight for them! Holy crap, I once saw one kill 5 Wyverns in less than
20 minutes - WAY faster than those quadding Droods - and I don't think he
ever even took a point of damage. Sheesh, talk about wimpy fighting. He even
did something called "fear" which made the MOB's run away in a seemingly
random direction, seemed pretty dangerous for those folks who happened to be
close by.

Oh, and don't even let me get started on those lame ass bards. Do you
believe they actually CHARM the bad guys and get them to fight each other.
Puhhhlease, what a boat load of crap that is. Bards think they are soooo bad
because, get this, they can run very fast! Since when is running fast even
close to fighting like a man? I mean, you should see some of the trains
these bards cause when their charmed MOB beats down another and the
un-charmed one decides to run through a bunch of his buddies.

Oh yeah, speaking of pets, what is the story with Enchanters? They are
always giving this lame story about not being able to control their pet when
it decides to go off and aggro a whole zone. Likely story. I don't know why
they use a pet at all. I mean they can stand and tank just like the rest of
us.

Anyway - cheers to all! Don't forget to root those MOBs being quadded by
your local Drood. Teach them how to play like a man. After all, a druids job
is to port folks into a zone so they can be dumped for the
cleric/enchanter/shamy!
