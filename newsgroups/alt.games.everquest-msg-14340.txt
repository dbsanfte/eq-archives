After scurrying off to help our monkey puller seperate out a pile
of stuff that had aggroed him on island 4, I ooced "Harmony
pull get ready..."

... and immediately was met with a howl of "NOOOO SUIIIIIIII"
from our high priest in attendance.

When I asked why "huh?! Why? He's gonna get poundied!" I was
reliably informed harmony is one of those spells that has been
fettled for the plane of sky. Up there its *disharmony*, an AE
aggro spell ;)

Joke woulda been on me and our party if I'd cast it. Not a very
funny joke either ;)
