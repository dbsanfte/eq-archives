I was with Verizon DSL in Maryland but I kept getting 15 second lag
spikes about every hour or so.   15 seconds usually did not kick me
off but it did cause me to get killed many times.

I am not sure what they call it but when you sign up with Verizon DSL
you have to pick a carrier ??  or  something.  I picked Geunity (sp)
who did you go with?   I am thinking that they were the problem of the
spikes
