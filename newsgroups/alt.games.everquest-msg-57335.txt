 The thing that makes SK pulling better than a monk, in certain cases,
is the use of Darkness. For example in The Hole. When you pull you can
get 2-3 and when you feign they all go back at the same time. This makes
pulling with a monk quite frustrating. However, if one of the mobds has
darkness on him he'll go back slower and chain-pulling will be much
easier. 

 But that's just pulling. I'm not sure where the 'best FD' comes in.
It's sure nice casting FD and getting the 'fallen to the ground
messages' (assuming I can channel it through) then having to wait 15
seconds or whatever it is to recycle while mobs are beating on me to try
it again. 

 All I know is I die a lot more soloing with my SK than I did with my
Monk due to the failures/recycle time. That could be just a behavioral
change though. As a monk I wait until the last bubble before feigning.
That's not such a good idea with a SK. I just need to trying feigning
earlier if it looks like I'm in trouble.
