it'll be tough but there are a few bandits at the yelloweyes camp he can 
pull solo.  And don't forget the mushrooms.

There's a mushroom in the first hall out from Shadowhaven, if it's green 
kill it anyway, only way to get mature to pop there.  Then go around the 
bandit camp on the wall to the right as far up as you can so you don't 
get agro.  If you are lucky you'll see another mushroom when you get 
past the camp.  Don't go up the path farther unless you wanna kill 
fiends, more on them in a minute.  Stay on the shore of the lake, 
there's one that moves around some along the shore, and one on the 
little island.  There's another along the far wall, that is sometimes a 
higher level named Maricella.  You may not be able to take her on solo 
at first.  If you are lucky enough to get in a group there, you can 
slide to 26 inside of a week.  16 to 20 at yelloweye's camp and over 20 
at the ringo camp.

If you are looking to solo the fiends, have high svdisease before you do 
it.  They will DoT you with 'spreading crud'.  That durn spell lasts 2 
hours or more and takes 3 casts of cure disease to get rid of, but of 
course rangers don't get that spell until 22. GRR, almost killed my 
ranger one time, ran out of bandaids and money to buy more(I was poor 
from birth and fletching didn't help) and mana for heals.  Had to beg 
and beg and beg for a cure that time.

Good luck and head to Marus seru at 26 or try Stonebrunt if you are 
worried about PK-ers, that's usually an empty zone. You can do 
Stonebrunt in early 20s, I went there before Luclin came out.  I think 
they nerfed the bonus in stonebrunt but it's still a good open zone to 
do fear kiting if you are careful.
