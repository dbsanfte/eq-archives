Safe (but slow): Oasis, East Freeport, boat, Ocean of Tears, Butcherblock,
unboat, barge, Timorous Deep, boat, Timorous Deep, Firiona Vie, Lake of Ill
Omen.

Dangerous (but faster than the safe route): Oasis, barge, Timorous Deep,
unbarge, island...go off to the right to the ogre village, and wait at the
pier, boat, Overthere, jump off boat as soon as it zones, and swim to the
left of the big wall that is the outside of the evil outpost...or if you
are a bard, you could sing the invis song and just get off at the pier and
run it. Zone out of OT is on the right hand wall, through a valley (not
through a building...skyfire = very bad at L20). Frontier Mountains, Lake
of Ill Omen.

Dangerous (but really fast): Wizard/Druid port to Dreadlands, Firiona Vie,
Lake of Ill Omen.

Really fast, and quite safe... if you can levitate and invis: Oasis, barge,
Timorous Deep, Firepot Room, West Cabilis, Lake of Ill Omen.
