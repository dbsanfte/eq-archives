damn eBay!

hehe.... thats not really as bad as the character that trained a giant on
our party at the ill omen zone line

it beat on my druid and I zoned, got into ill omen and healed myself then
began to med.... this dope asked me 3 times for sow, each time I was telling
him I was oom, waay oom, so oom that i give oom a new name and tha5t it was
his giant that made me this way.

it was a level 35 cleric  <shrug>

makes me wonder how these people get to lvl 10, let alone 35.... but I think
the account selling has alot to do with it
