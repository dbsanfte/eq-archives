Well, having been in NEG for over three years (I was the first member to 
break 60), I have to say that they are all, mostly, exceedingly nice 
people and a pleasure to be with. Never raided with them, though, as 
they have very, very few people online during GMT-friendly hours. Very 
few 65s... Me and three others, as far as I know.

In all honesty, I'd say that if raiding is your concern, look elsewhere. 
I have the nagging suspicion that we'd wipe to Emperor Crush. :)

Chris, if you have seen NEG form, you must have been in Fennin for quite 
a while... NEG is probably one of the oldest guilds in the game, 
considering Fennin was one of the beta servers. I wonder if I've seen 
you around. :)
