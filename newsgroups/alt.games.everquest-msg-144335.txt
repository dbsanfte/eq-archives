Lucy has no data under stacking for any of the spells in that
line, so I asked here.  Are you sure about the Cleric AC line?
I know that that line conflicts directly with the Enchanter
AC line (Blur, etc.), which does stack with the Shielding buffs,
so I had assumed there would be no problem with those.
