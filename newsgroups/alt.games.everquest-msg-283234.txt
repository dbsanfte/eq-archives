 First whatever your using to post/quotem you might want to check the
settings. It quoted a bunch of html (seems like) tags.

 Now as for the page not saying what people want it to say, I believe
you were talking about the reoccuring charge? Correct me if I'm wrong
though.

http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50003&month=042005

"Even better news: From April 11, 2005 to May 11, 2005, any current EQ
player can purchase a 12-month EQ subscription for a special price
($99.99 plus applicable taxes) resulting in a potential savings of
more than $50 off of the standard, monthly subscription fee. Game
software is sold separately. The EverQuest Sixth-Year Anniversary
12-month Subscription fee is a recurring charge; that means that,
unless and until you cancel your account, you authorize SOE to charge
your credit card the subscription amount ($99.99 plus applicable
taxes) immediately upon signing up for the Sixth-Year Anniversary
12-month subscription plan and again at the beginning of each
subsequent 12-month subscription period. For this special offer, that
means that you will be billed immediately in full on the day you
initially sign-up for this special offer and then you will also be
billed on the date that is 12 months from that date and so on."

The above taken from the websites says:

- The price is $99.99
- The charge is for 12 month subscription to EQ only
- Unless and until you cancel your account you authorize Soe to charge
  your card $99.99  immediately upon signing up for the Sixth-Year
  Anniversary 12-month subscription plan and again at the beginning of
 each subsequent 12-month subscription period.
- It does not say if your change your credit card info the offer will
  be null and void and you'll have to pay the regular amount.

 It says exactly what people are bitching about. Soe is caught.
Kythrea said they would speak to the higher ups at Soe on Monday (May
15th) to see what is planned to fix this. While I only yook a brief
glance through the forums I saw no mention of it as of yet BUT it has
only been one day.
