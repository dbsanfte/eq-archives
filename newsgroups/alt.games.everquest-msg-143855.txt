Well, maybe it's just me, but I don't make a profit off my friends.  If I
find a spell for 300pp, and I know a friend of mine needs it, I'll snap it
up, and ask him to pay the 300pp I paid for it.  Even if, at 20k, they are
saving 40k.  I also expect the same treatment from my friends, and,
generally speaking, I get it.
