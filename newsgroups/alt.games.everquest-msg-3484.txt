It can be done,  AFAIK you need to be able to embed the <CR> and color
codes into your macro. Good Luck.  to keep everyone honest have the GL
do a /random 1000 and then everyone randoms to the result  /random 1000 
Result 764
For the next random you /random 764
Repeat for each drop, and keep track that winners don't roll again till
all have something.
