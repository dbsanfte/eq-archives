I have arguments with the "it's only an orc pawn, get over it" 
statement, but I've argued over it here before, so I won't bother going 
into it.

The problem I can see with this solution is, you can still get KSers 
saying things like "I pulled it with a spell/arrow and couldn't see its 
name from there".  It'd help for charmed/mezzed mobs, but then charmed 
mobs can't be attacked anyways, and mezzed mobs - well, I'd rather learn 
which players enjoy breaking mez early in the game.  Kinda helps you 
guess what other stupid things they'd try later on in the game and avoid 
them.
