I'm sorry, but once again you're on a different point than what was
originally intended.

As for Happ, she's very easy to camp for Druids... it's just that the Druids
involved probably rarely face casters so they don't have a terribly good
strategy.

Buff up with Skin like Diamond, Resist Fire, Endure Magic, and Chloroplast,
cast Firestrike on Happ, (stand still, I could tank her even on my Druid),
wait for her to start casting, then cast Fury of Air to stun, throw in a
Calefaction, Firestrike once more, and use level 39's Root to finish the
job. Yes, you've taken some damage, but as you med Chloro will take you back
to full health and FM by the time she spawns again.

Fury of Air is a 250 DD/Stun (all or nothing) - much like Cleric DDs. So
Clerics are actually good with Happ (Enchanters probably have it the
easiest) there are exceptions, but as a Cleric your choices are generally
limited and it's bluntly not worth the effort unless you for some odd reason
can't get a group. -When has that happened? :b
