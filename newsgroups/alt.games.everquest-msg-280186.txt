Please.

Sony hasn't deleted a single account yet.    Ever.   (Not counting banned
accounts, of course.)

Nor does it make any sense for them to do so.  Whether they delete characters
or not, accounts are still going to be cancelled when people get sick of the
game.   The only thing character deletion would assure is that almost none of
those canceling accounts would return.

I personally have quit twice for periods of a year and a half. (Oct 99 to Jan
01 and February 03 to May 04)   Each time my characters were sitting there
waiting for me to come back, if I decided to.    If I had had to restart, I
would never have returned for either one.

"We need a new Mario game, where you rescue the princess in the first ten
minutes, and for the rest of the game you try and push down that sick feeling
in your stomach that she's "damaged goods"... When Peach asks you, in the
quiet of her mushroom castle bedroom "do you still love me?" you pretend to be
asleep. You press the A button rhythmically, to control your breath, keep it
even." - Joey Comeau on increased realism in gaming.
