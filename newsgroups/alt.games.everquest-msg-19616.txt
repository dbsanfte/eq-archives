Okay, my monk will most likely ding 45 tonight. I've been grouping in 
Dreadlands for the past couple of levels, with a short but sweet stint in 
City 
of Mist. With constant pulling in Dreadlands last night I got about 3 yellow 
in 5 hours or so. Not bad.. but hell is looking like 17+ hours at that rate. 
I 
want to get to 46 ASAP (47 preferably) because my guild has a Hate raid on 
the 
13th.

Any ideas for solo locations? Or grouped? I know about the bloodgills, but 
I'm 
not ready for all that underwater fighting (I'm probably the only Iksar that 
doesn't like to swim). I want to go back to CoM, but that place is 
definitely 
BYOG.

Any input would be appreciated!
Anita
