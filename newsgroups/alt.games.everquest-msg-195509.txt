Thanks for all the responses. All I have to collect is the posion sacs, which I'm gonna do today. 
I'm on the Therris Thule server, sorry reo.
My 2hs is in the high 160's, don't remember exactly, and I bought a ghoulsbane a week before they
made it no drop. I have used it as my exclusive 1hs weapon nad have a drakkel forged 2 hand, and an
axe that procs a cold based spell. Also have a luggard dagger, piercing skill is only 50 and a
coldain velium mace 1hb is around 80. Any suggestions for a 2hb that is easy to get/cheap to buy.
