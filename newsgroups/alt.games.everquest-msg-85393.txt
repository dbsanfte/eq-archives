Verant selling a server with premium service is like
Yugo selling a luxury car.

Verant will never convince me that it is capable of
good quality customer service.  GMs are accusatory
and confrontational, and frankly almost never available
in a reasonable amount of time. GM player slaughters
er, um quests, are mostly a joke, with "winners" determined
almost at random.

Given Verant's record on things CS related, a one
way character transfer is way to risky for me.
What if you transfer and it sucks? Where are
the guarantees to protect the Legends customers?
