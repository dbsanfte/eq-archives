This post has the start for a great letter to Verant... but quickly met it's
demise when you started telling people how to respond and namecalling.
I suggest you continue the letter and send it off to Verant AND Sony.  The
more they hear from dissatisfied customers, the more annoyed they'll get,
and the more annoyed they get, the bigger chance there is for them to
actually DO something about it.
