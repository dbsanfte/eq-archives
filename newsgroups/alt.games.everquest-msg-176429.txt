You know actually that's a great idea. Maybe they can get some sponsors to
insert advertising into the game and then we can play for free.  You know
when you go to a merchant and he says "Hail Seefar, would you be interested
in this nice Taco Bell Ulimate Burrito I just got in?  It's a Hearty Meal"
or maybe a billboard as you are running through West Karana "Need Speed?
The new Ford Mustang will get you there fast!" or maybe some neon in the
nexus "Planning a long raid? Pizza Hut-We deliver!"  The possibilities are
endless.
