    Obligation?  No.  There are no written contracts in EQ about
one's obligation to group.  But there is a little thing called
"Dealing with your reputation".  If one is dependent on pick up
groups (and I don't know that the OP is), then getting a rep as a
cleric that will suddenly bail as a means of refusing to rez
someone would not be a Good Thing.

   I can see your point, and DT's also.  But I think that the
majority of people who where grouped with a cleric when this sort
of drama takes place would be pretty pissed.  Justified or not, I
wouldn't recommend doing this sort of thing.

   I do think that the best way to have dealt with this situation
would simple to /tell the GL "He goes or I do... what's your
choice?"  And then accept the chips where they fall.

Annie
