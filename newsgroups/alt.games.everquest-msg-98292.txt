You must have missed the newbie and mid levels that were added with Kunark
and with Luclin.  What about Warrens and Stonebrunt?  Things are added to
the game for all levels at various times.  With Luclin a lot of new spells
and equipment came into the game for players of all levels, from level 1 on
up to level 60.
