It's not difficult code to write, but it forces a bunch of design decisions
that change the feel of the game. 

If you go with "first tag gets the mob", you ALSO must code in "mobs only
aggro the tagger", or you get the ability to train someone, make him
kill the mob, then you get to loot.  There are likely other decisions about
aggro and hatelist management that flow from this choice, all of which
change the flavor of the game radically.  

Whether these are good or bad decisions I can't say, except that I prefer
EQ to WoW overall.

Of course it did, it has been a hotbutton topic every time players chat with
devs.  Brad & co. were very resistant to the idea of making a
massively single-player game by making it too easy to ignore others.  It's
the reason there were no instances for a long time too.  Again, perhaps
misguided and perhaps genius, but it was an explicit choice, not a coding
issue.

Did you ask them?  It's possible they don't speak english and are used to a
different game ethic where this is just normal behavior, in which case there's
not much to do.  It's possible they're just jerks.  It's also possible that
they really don't understand that you're actually fighting the mob, rather
than waiting for your group and got jumped or something.

That is one of the joys of the EQ system!
