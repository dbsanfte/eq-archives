	I wouldn't go that far - if the tank isn't pulling (I frequently pull 
too) there is a Puller who frequently needs to know their business, 
crowd control, slower etc who need to be at keyboard. Although, a 
typical problem for pickups groups is a lack of effective CC. My usual 
rule for pickup group pulling is "I will bring a single or die in the 
attempt, cos a double is a 50% chance of a wipe." But yes, as a tank, I 
feel strongly that we are a more-than-average gear & skill dependant class.

	Would I have it any other way? Nup ;) It just causes me problems that 
there are tanks with 1.5 times my hitpoints and AC out there, and people 
who are used to healing & slowing for those tanks.

	It can also be very disheartening to spend literally years building up 
your gear, only to continually maintain a level of near-pathetic 
mediocrity at the bottom of the pack. I know for certain that skillwise, 
I am right up there with the best SK's in the business, and that 
frequently players with half my played time are preferred in groups 
because they've been in a raiding guild and I haven't.

	Yes I've seen this a lot. A typical series of tells from a group 
looking for a tank will include queries about my HP and AC, and 
statements of opinion from non-tank classes about my ability to tank in 
an area (EG MPG) based on these stats. I frequently find these 
statements to be hilariously off-base, and find it highly 
amusing/appalling that in three years, I've yet to be asked about my AA's.

	AA's of course contributing (at a guess) something like 30% overall 
mitigation for an SK. (add the mitigation/avoidance AA's to the Vampiric 
+ heal crit + crit etc), its somewhat horrifying to think a group might 
accept a tank with 500 more HP than I do but 200 fewer AA's without even 
finding out this difference.

	Naturally, when I turn up, its often apparent the people who I had to 
argue with about my ability to tank, aren't anywhere near my level of 
equipment or experience. Not only are they incorrectly commenting on 
_my_ field of expertise, they often barely understand their own. (I 
could swear ebaying has gotten more common of late, but that's another 
thread of its own)

	One of my pet hates is people who aren't willing to stick with a group 
and make it work - the kind who will quit after one wipe. How the hell 
did these people get through 70 levels of everquest?

	I once spent a morning mostly dead in WoS with a guild group who never 
gave up. We came out well ahead in experience, plat and gear, but wiped 
something like 10 times. (not exagerating, could easily have been 15 - 
geniunely lost count)

	Having finally seen fantastic encounters like Rathe Council, Coirnav 
and Time trials, I couldn't agree more. Why the hell didn't even 8% of 
that coding and design effort go into single-group stuff (where most of 
EQ's players & payers reside)?
