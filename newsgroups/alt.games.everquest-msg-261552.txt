I need advise from someone who knows how to play a 40 ish shaman in ldon's.

I was soloing white mobs in JPF at level 42 and getting fewer resists than i
get from the deep blue mobs in the mistmoore catacombs. Is that normal? It
just made it so that either the mob or the tank would be dead before the
spell seemed useful. Alas, no chanter was with us, so no tash.

 I hasted the tanks, myself and my pet (who seems to have ok dps with the
pet toys, although hand of ixiblat doesn't seem to proc, alas) and gave them
what buffs I could but i was a little unsure of how to play my shaman
effectively in that role. It didn't help when they zoned into the dungeon
before i was ready... my zoning is slow because i have a cheap sucky isp and
live in australia, and everyone was dropping like flies because the tank got
feared and a massive train resulted, so we ended up not completing the
dungeon, and the main tank kept going link dead too, oh the pain, the pain!

Anyhoo, i guess the question is, should i expect my slows to be resisted?
The party had highest level of 46 but th mobs were still deep blue. Should i
have given up on slow, even despite my party's frequent requests for the mob
to be slowed? Is there a magic resist debuff I've overlooked perhaps?

I've also been advised that a shaman's role is to sit there, but the mmc
seem to have lots of casters, ch themselves or fearing tanks, and surely a
slam or two is a good idea, especially as i have a club that procs a 75
point lifetap and the dex for several procs a fight? I can heal myself
nicely so long as the tank keeps aggro and with the pet i can distract adds
from mabbitting the casters pretty nicely. Winter's roar seems to generate
enough aggro to save a cleric, but it is a lot of mana.

I've been thinking about going back to JPF (the xp was actually better) but
i have no augments and would like to get the points together for the shaman
ldon spells. I've done about 10 missions with my 35 cleric and the xp and
survivabilty seemed higher. Maybe that was just a run of bad luck. If you
have any advice I'd love to hear it. The shaman sites i've seen are either
for the 65+ crowd (saw a lv 70 today, gadzooks) or hopelessly dated.
