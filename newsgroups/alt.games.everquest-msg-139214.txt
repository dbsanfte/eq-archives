These days it's 75% they'll take if one pet does ALL the damage
to a mob.  Back when I did my 5 pet group, your group still needed
to outdamage a pet.  One of the mages had the 56 DDD pet, with it's
AE taunt (which appears to be lure based - it lands on Rak), it
was always MT, and it's owner kept it healed.  The rest of us used
rains on pairs of mobs.  That taunt was nice, we never peeled even
the one the pet wasn't hitting.
