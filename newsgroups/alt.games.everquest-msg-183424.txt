    Yes and no. All I know about this is what I've read on non-SWG forums,
but this is my understanding:

    If certain conditions are met, your account gets a force-sensitive
character slot added to it (all accounts start with only one character
slot). If the character in that slot dies at lower level, he becomes a force
ghost and cannot really interact with anything. If he's higher level, he
becomes a force ghost like Obi-Wan or Yoda and may be able to interact with
things (he will be able to talk to players). At any point you can delete the
dead character and restart another jedi - you never lose the force-sensitive
character slot.

    Given that at this point in time a Jedi is supposedly able to kill 20
other non-force sensitive characters in a fight, I don't see early Jedi
death being an issue. ;-)
