I'm quitting EQ. I've found Jesus, and he tells me that there is no room in
my life for this game. He says it's Satan's tool. Also, I'm becoming a
priest, so I won't have time to play anymore. I can only hope that my friend
Blueslayer can find Jesus as well.

Actually I've come to realize over the past few weeks wasted way too much of
my life on this game. When I look back at all the time I've spent playing
this game, months and years that I can't get back, that I could have spent
in the REAL world, with my REAL friends, it almost brings me to tears. I
hate this game so much now.

Anyway, fuck everquest. Anyone who plays this game is a fucking loser.

Fuck you to: Bonekiller, Wyndcrow, Whitesnake, Earthbear and Redwolf.

Thank you to: Bluemender, Earthslayer, and Redbear.

Love and kisses,
Kenny
