Hehe I won't quote just to add one line, but I gotta respond to say that
what BDev00032 (someone I've never seen post before) says is exactly how
I've found it.

There are definite downsides to EQ, but there are definitely downsides to
DAOC (www.darkageofcamelot.com) and if you like PvP I'd suggest DAOC first.
If you don't fall in love with the game, try EQ.

Then again, EQ is a bit cheaper than DAOC so if money's an issue, try EQ
first. :)

They're both good games.  I play both.  I've been playing EQ for 2.5 years,
almost every day (pathetic, eh?).  EQ is much more polished - content-wise -
but it's also much older and the graphics are currently not as pretty as
DAOC.  Creating a character in DAOC is much more involved than in EQ and I
liked that.

I've also heard of people leaving DAOC to come back to EQ, but I'm sure
there are plenty who have moved to DAOC and have not looked back.  Despite
what folks tend to think, I DO NOT agree that the two games are the same
genre...there's just too many differences (I'm not looking to start a
debate, no one's gonna change my mind and I don't really feel like it's
important enough to try to change someone else's :) ).
