Trivial Loot Code (TLC), often refered to as the Warren Loot Code (WLC) or the
Trivial Combat Code (TCC), is a code place in the game that sets up a situation
that if a player kills a mob that does not give that player experience and that
mob drops an item that is either Lore, No Drop, and/or Magic, that item will not
appear in the loot results on the corpse but instead be destroyed by the code
and not lootable by any player. This code further expands to include any group
where there is not atleast 1 character in the group that gets an experience gain
from the death of the mob.

This code first appeared in the newly added zone of Warrens. Subsequently, it
was placed on the Stoneburnt Mountains zones. There have been some official
statements from Verant that they are considering to place this code on all or
some of the zone that will appear in the Shadows of Lucin expansion do to be
released this winter.
