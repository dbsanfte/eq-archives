Unfortunately the best way is with a rolled up newspaper or something heavier.
Its all those bangs to the head i'm sure of it.

The best way is to demonstrate it - find a single mob and have them watch as
you mez it and then dance round it making rude gestures, etc. Keep re-mezzing
it until they get the idea that you can do it all day long, and then tell them
straight that when you say 'mob 1 is mezzed' it damn well stays mezzed until
you let them off the leash.
Then tell them that if they break the mez your heading straight for the zone
and leaving them to it. 
"You" are not dieing because they can't play to your strengths/potential. 

I got shown this my first time grouping with an enchanter (yes i asked what mez
was and yes i got some funny looks/tells). But it's because that person took
the time to show me i started playing one myself. 

The same goes for /assist - if they can't grasp the concept of everybody
wacking on a single critter to get it out the way faster you might be better of
ooc-ing for a new group.
