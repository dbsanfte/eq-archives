Hehe, bad example.
The original Wolvenstein was made in the days when a 386 was state of 
the art. It do not run on new machines (will maybe do if you know enough 
about dos to get memery to run it, and got a slow util so it dont run 
too fast). If you have the machine Wolvenstein was designed for you ARE 
forced to upgrade (or rather, get a new comp) to play Return to Castle 
Wolvenstein. And if you got a comp that can play RtCV, you will have to 
either get a slow computer or be good at manual memory management and 
slowdown utils to play the first one.
