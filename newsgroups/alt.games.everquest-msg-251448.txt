Not to get on SOE's bandwagon but what we want is not exactly easy to
do, at least what I want isn't.  What I really want is the zero
confinement of D&D within a programmed environment.  It's really not
possible yet.

Not that I think SOE couldn't do alot better with what they've got, I
just think that this is not a reasonable area to bash them.  There's
plenty of others....
