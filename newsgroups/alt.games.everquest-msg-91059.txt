    I would just like to point out that Verant is in fact doing a job to fix
those bugs that show up.  I own an ATI graphics card, and if you pay
attention to older posts, you'll know that there was a major problem with
boats "Blowing up."  In their patch earlier this week, that problem was
thankfully solved, along with the floating zone problem I was experiencing
as well.  I will admit this took a long time to fix, but I also realize that
they had to work with ATI to figure out where exactly that problem was, and
how to fix it.  All without ATI being willing to divulge corporate
"secrets".

    If all you can do is complain, go play something else.

The first step towards failure is to try.  Therefore if someone has never
failed, they have never tried.
