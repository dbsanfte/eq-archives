<snipped much stuff I agree with>

Getting a KEI before you go to a
camp spot is one thing, something
many of us do.  But this trend of
running off to get KEI, especially
healers, and leaving an entire group
standing around waiting is just
intolerable.  

My recommendation - whenever possible
form your own groups.  Don't invite
people you know do this.  If they say
they are running off for KEI - tell them
you will replace them if they leave.
