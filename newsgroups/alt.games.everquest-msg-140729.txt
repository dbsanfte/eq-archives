Pure casters only?  "Pure casters" is one of those "it means this
here and something else there" terms.   "This" being INT casters
and "something else" being INT casters and the priest classes.
Both ignore the hybrids, so here's my choices for both of those
definitions:

INT caster only (no hybrid):

Magician and enchanter.  Magician provides decent "burst" damage
with their nukes as well as "tanks" to both dish out damage as
well as take it.  Enchanter provides mana regen to help speed
things up, crowd control to make it safer, slows/stuns to help
keep the pet alive, and, by the time a wizard or druid can port
and around when a druid can SoW, both the enchanter and mage
will get those spells too. ("Trading clarity for port/SoW" works
most of the time).   It's a good combo for duo work and the
enchanter can get them both into groups later on.

Both INT casters and priest classes (no hybrid):

Druid and necro.  Good travel and stacking DoTs and the ability
to fear kite with the pet (and heal it very well when fear isn't
sticking well.)  A solid combo as long as you're able to find
a spot to fear kite and/or root/DoT.  (Not that they're difficult
to find, just that you have to find them.)  Another advantage is
the ability of them to effectively 'solo' together, with the pair
really just providing a safety net for the other.
