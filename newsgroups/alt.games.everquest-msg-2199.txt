Yeah, based on just this thread I was tempted to call him a troll
myself. But I went back and read a bunch of his other posts, and I'm
pretty sure he's an enthusiastic EQ player, who simply was a little
naive about the expansion.

Yes, like I said, idiots get flamed. Say something stupid, and it will
be pointed out in no uncertain terms.

No indeed, you didn't. What you did instead was to condescend to
everyone else and act as though you were taking some moral high road.
