I'm sorry, kaev, that example doesn't work here.  "Hot water is used to brew
tea" would be grammatically equivalent to "NBG is used as a lie to promote
the greed of players who only go where the loot they want drops".  If you'd
worded in that way you would not have been making a generalization, because
you wouldn't have been saying that it is *always* used to promote greed, or
that a certain type of people *always* use it that way..  The argument was
not that NBG is not used that way, but that not all pickup groups do this.
So, the following statement:

" ...in a pickup group of strangers NBG is a lie used to
promote the greed of players who only go where the loot they want
drops."

allows for no exceptions to the generalization that pickup groups use it to
promote greed.  While NBG is no doubt used like this, some pickup groups use
it in a more honorable way, and only one example was required to disprove
your statement.

On the other hand I think everyone understands what you meant, and I doubt
you honestly believe that no pickup group anywhere ever uses NBG to be fair
to one another, so I personally don't care all that much about your grammar.
Just had to point that out though :)
