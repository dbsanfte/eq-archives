A little annoying, actually, but we so rarely use any language but common that
it won't have much affect on blue servers.  I imagine this was done for the Zeks
and for FV?

Despite them saying later that they haven't yet addressed the spell classes, this looks
like a big fix for the end game casters.  Course it -might- be a nerf, if those supposed
immunities were previously capable of being overcome via high level Tash/Malo combo
resist debuffs... but it looks like it was aimed at Uber mobs that really weren't
castable on whether this was attempted or not.

Changing caps means that most of these improvements are aimed strictly at the
high end game.  I suppose in this case this makes sense, since most people
agree that all classes are worthwhile up to the fifties, when things have been
reduced to Cleric/Warrior/Enchanter versus "some other guys of limited use"

Still, I wish they'd looked more at ways to make the 51 paladin, or whatever,
more useful, instead of principly the 60.  I guess the change in combat
table is meant to accomplish this?

Looks like Chardok has been changed.  Why?  This wasn't one of the
lanquishing unoccupied zones!

There are any number of zones almost noone visits, why not put your efforts into
working on those instead?
