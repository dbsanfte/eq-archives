for me when binding... If I am at 49 % it usually will say I cannot
bind for more than 50 %, but if I am at 48 % it will bind me up to a
total of 51 or 52 %...

now that my skill is at 201, I can bind to 70 %, and if it is at 69 %
(even when I have Aego/Virtue with a total of 3K HP) it will say I
cannot bind for more than 70%.
