Thanks for the tips on playgrounds, i have been with a group in oasis,
but i felt very uncomfortable there, with them drybones and spectres
roaming, got killed twice in short time, the second time was acctually
when i returned to loot my own corpse, karanas is big and dangerous i
guess, i have been in west karanas with my guys from qeynos, ended
badly almost every time :) but they are only lvl 7.

Overthere could be something, i have planed on going there for my
banshee aura spell, but how dangerous is the trip there from neriak?
i think i now how to get there with some boat from oasis, but not
shure..

/Regards Berth
