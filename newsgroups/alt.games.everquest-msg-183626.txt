Ahah, hello ex guildie, it was blasting round the Wyrds last night that
these spells are obtained in the LoY zones, and that they were drops in
Gulf of Gunthak.

More than that I cant tell you, not even if they are sold anywhere. Its a
matter of enough dropping that it filters thru the system

I'd imagine forums at casterrealm would have people making reports
