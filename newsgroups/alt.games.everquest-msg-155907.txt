It has been mentioned 100 times on this board, and I agree:  Anyone who says
"paying very well" is usually NOT paying *squat*.  Just last night, while
/anon, my druid saw the following transpire over the course of half an hour
while in the Overthere, (repetitions omitted):

Richguy:  Looking for a port to Nexus
Richguy:  Paying for a port to Nexus PST
Richguy:  Paying very well for a port to Nexus
Richguy:  Paying 20 plat for a port to Nexus.

20 plat is "paying very well????"  How many druids do YOU know who are high
enough level to play in the Overthere are going to drop their playing, wait
around for Richguy to show up, and then port with him to the Nexus for 20 plat?
 I don't know any either.  
And as long as I'm on a roll here, Richguy will be the type to say, once he's
WITH YOU, "oh, I don't have the 20 plat on me, can you port me and then I'll
run to the bank?"
FWIW, I ported a guy to the Nexus last night for free from the OT who was on a
corpse run.
There's "need" .... and then there's "greed".  I can empathize with the first. 
I guess I'm guilty of the second and 20 plat just doesn't cut it.
