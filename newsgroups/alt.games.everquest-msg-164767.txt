Lemme correct you on a few points

1- No person can make a fool out of another. Being a fool is self inflicted
by ones own person.

2- Now if you were actually interacting with people in real life, you
wouldn't be in here claiming to be interacting. Fact is loser, this is your
life.

 Now, put the Thesaurus away, and stop acting like your actually educated.
Point number 1 kind of sums your education and mentality up.

 You got anything to add stupid ?
