This sounds like Trak's Teeth to me, particularly the use of "cycle".  The
level is right, everybody calls those the hunter/forager cycles for no
reason I can figure out (the hunter and forager are just placeholders, and
the mob that spawns when you kill them is completely random), and the most
expensive item dropped there is the Iksar Ceremonial Breastplate, which
sells for about 15k.

Of course, it's not near as easy as they make it sound.  I spent several
days there trying to get several items (nooses, trak tooth, iksar hide
mask...) without seeing anything we wanted or anything worth more than
about 2k.

You might as well camp the greens in City of Mist.  They will rarely drop
items worth anything from 40pp to 40kpp, and you don't even need to track.
