I and a few friends have recently returned after several years exploring
other worlds, particularly Albion.  And, as returning players we have talked
about many of the changes.

First, the Plane of Knowledge and the transportation there.  While we find
it very convenient, we have also pointed out the lack of adventure involved.
Just as you say, managing to make it across Antonica alive at any level
below about 15 was a true challenge.

Next, The Bazaar, while it is very convenient to have such a place to buy or
sell anything, it has removed the incentive to do quests and obtain items
for oneself.  Like the quest for Morin's Sword.  Ages ago, this was a
worthwhile quest to do.  Now, if one saves a little coin, one can simply buy
a better weapon.  No risk, no effort.  "Why bother doing this quest when I
can buy the UberXxX Blade in the Bazaar?"

I enjoyed questing and as much as I like my newbie being able to quest for
his beginning armor, there was a time when getting ANYTHING with a stat on
it was a serious challenge and well worth the reward.  Hells bells, getting
a set of Banded Armor, no stats at all was a special occasion.  We worked
our butts off to get our Smith up in level and keep him in coin so he could
outfit us all.  "Bah...who needs that crap now, go to the Bazaar and for Xpp
you can get a full set of MagnificoxXx Armor.  And it looks cool too!"

We also discussed the basic run speed of everyone, no bonuses of any kind.
Either our speed is a tad higher or the beasties are a tad slower, because
there was a time when getting in trouble without any speed increase, SoW, or
Selo's you where dead.  Period.  No questions.  If you held out in battle
too long you would not get away and you and/or your party would die.  Now, I
have noticed, I can stay just far enough ahead of the pursuing beast that I
can make it to safety.  No real fear of death.  Having been a Paladin, it
was a point of pride for me that if my group got into trouble I would hold
the rear as they escaped, even if I died.  That, to me was part of being a
Paladin.  I made a good many friends that way.  Now, there is no reason to
worry, since everyone will be able to stay far enough out of range so as not
to die before we can escape.

Do not get me wrong, we are enjoying our return, but there are some things
that we feel are missing.
