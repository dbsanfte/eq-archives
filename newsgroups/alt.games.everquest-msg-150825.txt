I don't think the tutorial works anymore. Unless you bought an old
copy of the game and ran the tutorial before patching.

Its a shame really. That tutorial was great for a brand new player
and explained a lot in just a few minutes. Verant should really update it.

Lokari's site should go under a trade skill sites heading.
With http://www.eqtraders.com/ the best site out there
for trade skills.

Allakhazam's listed twice.

EQdruids should go under class information.

Still under construction last update was in February, probably

MUD = Multi-user Dimension/Dungeon. A text based multi-player game.

Don't think that line does anything anymore.

>          VideoModeBitsPerPixel=16

To increase frame rate many options and settings
are available now in the game under the options menu
in game to adjust.

Someone else already pointed out that newbies don't start with
the book anymore.

You also cannot be bound or teleported by a non-pvp player.
Which is a huge disadvantage on a 'blue' server.

The tutorial no longer works at all.

These can be changed in game now under the options window.

Mobs also have other powers that PCs do not have that the new
player might want to be aware of such as:

Mobs can teleport to you if they get stuck on
something also known as warping.

Mobs regenerate mana standing up and at a MUCH
faster rate than PCs can sitting down meditating.

All Mobs can breath underwater and never drown.

All Mobs take zero damage from falling, no matter
the height.

All mobs are immune to lava damage, if they fall into it.

A Mob can hit a PC if the PC is standing inside them,
A PC cannot hit the Mob.

PCs cannot shoot mobs with missile weapons if they
are above or below a certain height. Mobs can shoot
PCs from any height.

Mobs never run out of arrows.

Mobs can cast through the water/air surface, PCs can't.

Mobs can pass through PCs and other Mobs at will.
PCs cannot.
