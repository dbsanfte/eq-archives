Others have found some ways to do the quest, but it's a royal pain in the 
butt.  Being able to sneak is important, and making sure there is nothing 
close enough to aggro while you sneak behind him is important as well.  
Given that I have killed many goons, as well as the general from the 
outpost, it's unlikely that any potions would help me in any way, but, 
that may be a viable alternative for someone who is not extremely KOS to 
them.
