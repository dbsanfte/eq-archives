You can start earning aa at level 51 by hiting the "advanced skills" buton
in your inventory screen. Set the percentage of xp earned going to aa to
something above 0.
Since each point of mc gives 1 extra mana per tic, mc3=3 mana /tic (did I
miss something here?)
Seems to me that 3 points of regen would be worth getting almost straight
away.
I got to mc2 before I went back to 0% aa. Not generaly recommended to do aa
before 60, but I believe there are some good exceptions. Im going to get
regen 3 for my necro as soon as I hit 51. In my case, I did my aa while the
raptors were all still blue.
