When I'm in a group, I ask each person whether or not they want Virtue or
Symbol.

In a raid, we MGB HoV, and let those who don't want it click it off and beg
a PotN / Symbol from their friendly neighborhood cleric / druid.

You're leaving AC out of the equation.

Virtue + AotZ = 1855hp + 8 mana regen + 108 AC

PotN + Kazad + FotS = 2072 hp + 8 mana regen + 68 AC

Now, you could add Ward of Gallanty to that last equation:

PotN + Kazad + FotS + WoG = 2072 + 8 mana regen + 122 AC

So, at the cost of using two more buff slots, you get 24 more AC and 217
more hps.

FoS = 1 hour 20 minutes.
PotN = 1 hour 40 minutes.
Kazad = 1 hour 3 minutes.
WoG = 1 hour 21 minutes

Virtue = 2 hours 30 minutes
AotZ = 2 hours 24 minutes.

Speaking for myself, in a group situation I far prefer worrying about
re-casting two spells on myself every two and a half hours rather than
recasting one spell on myself every hour and one spell on myself every hour
and twenty minutes and wondering whether the shaman will remember to recast
every hour and twenty minutes, and worrying whether the druid will remember
to recast every hour and forty minutes.  That's assuming I'll even have a
druid and/or shaman in my group.

In a raid the situation becomes more ridiculous.  WoG is a single-target
spell, so forget about casting it on each and every person in the raid.  Now
your FotS / PotN / Kazad combo gives 40 less AC then Virtue / AotZ.  For
non-clerics, FotS / PotN / Kazad gives 128 more hps and 40 less AC than
Virtue / FotS.  Plus three people have to re-MGB the raid every hour or so,
killing their mana.  Far simpler to MGB one spell every 150 minutes and one
spell every hour and 20 minutes.

But there's no arguing with hit point junkies.  =)  Yes, I know every once
in a while those extra 120 hps will make a big difference - although I still
wonder how that stacks up with the mitigation of 40 more AC.  I always argue
that ease of managing buffs outweighs the rare situation where 120 hps is
the difference between life and death.  (And if someone is getting down to
120 hps, you have other problems with aggro control / healing strategies
that need to be worked out.)

I put it all down to "Furor Envy".  People want to have as much HP as
possible, no matter what buffing burden it places on others.  Not that
wanting HP is bad, but I think there's a tradeoff to be made.

There are endless arguments back and forth, of course.  So far our guild's
policy is to MGB Hand of Virtue and let those who aren't happy with that
setup request PotN / Kazad's as they will.  There hasn't been a lot of
grumbling about that so far, and it's worked out all right.  Not many folks
ask me for a symbol.  (Of course, we have between ten and twelve clerics on
every raid, so it could be they are getting more requests than I am.)  And
it's quite rare that anyone asks me for WoG.  And somehow our raids end up
all right - in those situations where we wipe, 120 hps would have made no
difference.  =)

Part of the reason why I argue in favor of Virtue, of course, is because I
hate buff juggling.  I remember what a blessing Aegolism was, because I only
had to cast one buff instead of three, and it lasted a very long time.  I
was quite dismayed when PoP brought up this shorter-duration multi-buff
option.  Dangit, I don't *wanna* keep rebuffing!  =)
