Don't get all excited, was just pointing out that email existed in case
you hadn't discovered it yet.  Your series of posts were of no interest
to anyone but sender and receiver.  You are not discussing the game, you
are making arrangements to play together, that is personal and as such
belongs in email.  If you would like me to rail against vermin please
continue to disregard decorum, I'll try to find the time to give you the
attention you so strongly desire.
