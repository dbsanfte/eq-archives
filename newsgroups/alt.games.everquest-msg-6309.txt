Not twinking is more fun to you, and I am the same way.  Nothing gives me
more satisfaction than dueling a twink of my same level and winning.  The
only twinks I don't like are the ones that say "Oh, I got all my equipment
from my friend or guild".  These people have equipment superior for their
level without ever learning the ropes.

I met a level 15 warrior the other day decked out in plate armor colored
purple that never put one point into Taunt.  He couldn't get the mobs off me
and he said he was taunting.  I asked him what his skill in Taunt was and he
said he had never seen the skill go up.  I guess I would have been ok with
this guy if he had normal equipment on and was new to the game.  But he was
new to the game with twinked gere on.  People like that get me killed.
*sigh

I wish people would at least go through the game the hard way at least once
to learn the ropes.
