	Yes, and your point is?

	Had I been running things, the epic weapons would have been the end of the
road in terms of general purpose weapons.  Anything in higher-level content
would have either been situational use or marginally better but with a cool
graphic or whaever, basically a trophy.

	The problem is that since several teams did the epics with no real
standards to adhere to, the power/utility is all over the place.  Most of the
caster ones are very nice; the only one that really seems a klunker is the
Necro.  Of the fighter epics, the Rogue, Ranger, Monk and maybe Bard ones are
great, and the others are all "eh".  I'll stand by what I said before; it's
not that Ragebringer is above the line, it's that too many of the others are
below it.

|Um, whoops.

	I didn't read everything he ever posted but that doesn't jive with what I
did read.  I distinctly remember him saying he set the drop rate on Stanos'
head to under 100% because he didn't want everyone running around with RB/FSS,
so he must have given some thought to people running the quest over.

	I'll pass, thanks....
