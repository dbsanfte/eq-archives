In the UK we don`t eiether and it is estimated that around 80% of a persons
ernings (though Income tax and VAT mostly) goes to the government.

Out of my montly salary around 350 - 400 pounds a month goes to the
government in the form of income tax and National insurance.

To Run my Car I have to put petrol in to it, and for every pound I spend on
petrol, about 70 to 80 pence goes to the government in fuel Tax.  (You
Americans think you got it bad worrying about having to pay a dollar for a
Gallon, wiat until you come over here and have to worry about paying a pound
a litre).

If I were to have my own house, that would be anything from around ï¿½800
upwards a year to the local council to pay for their services.  You may
think yeah, that sounds alright, but for an average UK house hold a year it
costs 2 pence a week to collect the rubbish (trash), making it a pound a
year (round these parts they don`t collect therubsigh for two weeks of the
year around christmas).

then you are paying 17.5% on most purchases as well, out side the "none"
esstainal stuff, like milk, water, bread and abgout 10% of the heating costs
for a house - if I`m over 65 and single or over 70 and married.

What do we get for this, supporting two massivly ineffiencet  quango like
organisations (aka the current government and the EU).  An untold number of
other smaller ineffiecnt organistions.  12 to 18 month waitng lists for a
hospitial appointment, paying 15 pounds to have a check up at the denstist
(aka the idea of "free" health cover is a myth).  Over crowded classrooms,
over crowded Jails.

Any way, I could go on, byut I think you get the pictuer
