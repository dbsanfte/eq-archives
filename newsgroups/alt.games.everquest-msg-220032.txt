10 years old at this point it's kind of a lost cause.

	Kosh was a member of a race billions of years older than humanity, the
Vorlons.  He was their ambassador to the Babylon 5 Advisory Council, which was
(originally) like the United Nations.  The Vorlons were very secretive about
themselves and their agenda.  Kosh was friendlier than other Vorlons towards
humans and the other younger races, and eventually sacrificed himself on their
behalf.

	The photo on the site is actually Kosh's replacement.  The Vorlons and the
higher-ups in the station's heirarchy didn't want it known that Kosh had died,
so the replacement was also referred to as Kosh.  Vorlon (almost) never left
their protective suits when others were around so no one could know it wasn't
the same Vorlon.  The replacement's real name was Ulkesh, though that wasn't
ever given on the show.  Ulkesh did not share Kosh's benevolent nature.
