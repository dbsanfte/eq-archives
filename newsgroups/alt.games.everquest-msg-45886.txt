Here is your basic problem... you have neglected to killfile
the troll.

His post was specious, designed solely to generate responses,
this is what trolls live for.

Clever of him to post as a reply to an existing thread, but
its no different than him starting one reading "They should
make it so trolls can hide and sneak like rogues" or so
forth; replying will only encourage him.

Then again, so will this post.
