Also worth noting that you will have to pay for the original game (the
CD's in the box set which have the user code you need) before you'll be
able to install it all and get set up. If you shop around you can get
the original version of EQ, or the Gold Version (Original plus first two
expansions) pretty cheaply.  You get a month free, as Richard said, then
it will be roughly 13 dollars US per month after that. You can pay a bit
less by purchasing your time in larger blocks (3 month, 6 month, 1
year).
