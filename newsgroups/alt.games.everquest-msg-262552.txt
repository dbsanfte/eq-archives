My understanding is that if the melody is interrupted by missed notes, 
stuns or any other means, it must be restarted manually. That being the 
case, it would have to be constantly monitored and restarted.

/melody may actually prove to be more trouble than it's worth even for 
vigilant bards, as quite often those third and fourth songs may drop too 
often for too long as a result.

I see it being useful primarily in a utilitarian capacity or at lower 
levels during downtime when a bard must twist two different songs to 
provide max regen for both mana and hp.
