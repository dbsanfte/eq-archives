All very good points.  Another thing whenever using your Credit Card, it is
law that your Credit Card must be visible at all times after you handed it
to the merchant.  Also if you ever sign a "carbon" type form (the old way of
doing it) or even the "carbonless" be sure to -retrieve- the carbon paper
from the merchant.  Do NOT let them throw it away no matter how insistent
they are that they shread it, etc, etc.  Also, be careful of some people,
keep your credit card upside down (the numers facing downward) up until the
point that you give it to the merchant representative and turn it upside
down immediately after getting it back.  Believe it or not, there are some
out there that actually "hunt" for those using credit cards so that they can
MEMORIZE the CC number to use online.  Its not a very uncommon practice.
Also, while keeping your CC upside down, hold your thumb over the
verification ID number (usually found on the signature strip).  I know this
seems like alot, but, as you have found already, once your CC has been
charged without your authorization, its difficult as all unholy hell to get
your credit.  The reason for this is also obvious no matter how unfair it
may seem to the innocent, that is, the ole "unauthorized" claim was used
often whenever someone actually DID charge something on their CC but didnt
want to pay for it.  It sucks, but, its the way of life now it seems.

Biz also made a good point.  If your son shares his account (take note
of -IF-) his friend(s) can go into the billing information and record the CC
number/date.  Verant might have masked the number once entered (would be a
smart thing to do) though I honestly cannot tell you since I've had my
account for 2.5 years now on the same credit card with no changes in billing
information (ie. I havent looked for 2.5 years if that information is still
visible).
