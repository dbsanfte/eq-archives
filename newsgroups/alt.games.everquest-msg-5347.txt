Let me clarify something for you. While you blame these people for what
is going, and call them newcomers, The fact remains that what ever is
going on here now is being cause by the ones that you are so willing to
defend. It was the old ones here that started this whole thing. Now with
a little insight applied you might be able to guess how long this will
continue. Now of course I could have told you that this will go one for
as long as the old ones feel threatened. Regardless of who is right or
who is wrong the result of all this is that this ng is a shambles now.
This is most likely due to the fact that there are people out there that
are not going to take crap from these people that attack newcomers in 
here. The old hierarchy lost this war on day one when they lost control
of this ng. I could tell you how to fix this but that would most likely
be futile. Most likely you can count on this to continue for at least a
year, or maybe longer.
