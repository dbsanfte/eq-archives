Looks like our guild will soon be taking it's first tentative steps into
the Plane of Sky.  I've been gathering all the raid information I can on
mobs, tactics, keys, etc.  (We're only thinking of trying the first
three... possibly four, the first time, with four groups of lvl 50 to 60
folks.)

However, several sources point out the fact that you may not get enough
keys in one go on some islands for everyone to move to the next. Then
they mention that you may have to do the "necro summoning trick" to move
up without waiting hours for respawns for more keys. But nobody seems to
mention just how this is done!

Is this some trick where you duel and consent and others move up and the
necro somehow can summon you? Makes no sense to my few brain cells.
Anyone recall how this frustrating lack-of-keys thing is handled?

(Note: I've only been to island one and the quest hall, myself.)
