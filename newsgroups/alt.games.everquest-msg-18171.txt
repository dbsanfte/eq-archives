No more or less than watching a bear walk through a wall or
see a wolf run over a tree. No more or less that 'chatting' with
friends across continents. No more or less than see someone's name
'float' above their head. No more or less than walking up to an NPC
and talking to them and getting robot responses.

Having an auto-map is just as easily 'immersed' into the game as
my character looking at a map. If you want to see a great automap
look at the Ultima Underworld maps. They were AWESOME, they
looked like real hand drawn maps, and did not take away from the
'immersion' in that game 'at all'. It just kills me that such a great innovation
like that died with those games.

Still 27 or 31 levels levels of boring the player.

Can anyone honestly say they 'enjoy' staring at a spell book?
I mean really.
