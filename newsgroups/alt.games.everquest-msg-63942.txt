I believe with the new models, you can change your face, IE you don't
like the face you have, pick a new one.  I might be tempted to do this
with my wood elf druid, I don't like his face now, but i forgot to
change it at creation, and boom, got a scowling pissed off looking
druid, had already gotten enough levels under his belt when i really
started to get disgruntled with his looks that i didn't want to recreate
him.
