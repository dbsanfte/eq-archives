Had a stupid little rogue ask me for sow the same way after using a /who 
DRUID to find me, so he didnt even know where i was.

Dork: Sow plx
Me:   No, i only sow people in visible range, and are TIRED of people 
using /who DRUID to find me.
Dork: If you dont wanna sow people, go play a class that cant sow.
Me, after 5 sec of laughing: If you want sow, go play a class that can sow.
