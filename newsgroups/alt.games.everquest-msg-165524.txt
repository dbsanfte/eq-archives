You mean like his assumption that Paladins are overpowered because we get
more of an effect from our AA points in melee than other hybrids?  He
forgets one thing, sure we may add more from our AA, but we start out
farther behind in total power.  The real comparison, say between a SK and a
Pally is that pallys melee increases by X, but his nuking damage effectively
increases by zero (since it was a non-issue to begin with, pretty much),
while a SK has the ability to raise both.  Oddly enough, by Thott's
reasoning, giving paladins useful nukes would nerf us, because AA points
would have less of an increase to our total damage.  Sounds like a nerf I
can live with.
