I agree. 

I think there is a suspension of disbeleif in play, that 'at some point 
in your life you must go out into the world and wrestle new knowledge 
from it with your own two hands because you've learned all that we can 
teach you'... and in EQ the premise is that point is at level 1.

Now, of course, in a mmog every other player in the game is presented 
the same 'adventure', and as soon as even one of them supercedes you, 
you can 'learn from them' instead of 'learning it for yourself', but it 
undermines the premise that you and your peers must go out into the 
world and conquer it... if 70th level titans are roaming around, holding 
your hand, teaching you to slay everything from kobold runts to dragon 
kings... and so it is discouraged via the mechanics.
