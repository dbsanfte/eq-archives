Some quest or other I think, also a Rogue party piece; stealing his
heart, and then giving it back.

I paid 75pp when I bought mine aeons ago, it was all the money in the
world to me at the time, and I thought it was awesome. Not worth much
anymore... 20pp? It has magic resist on it, and some low level casters
put it in their range slot, or poke rats with it when they start out.

Sell to vendor with all haste.
