Well, say you wanted to see all the EFFECT 2HS weapons available for a
DWF WAR.  I would use the ITEM SEARCH function, and all I would get
was a blank screen.  LOOKUP always seems to work for me as well.

Well as it turns out it appears to be working now when i tried it.  I
guess the filter system was repaired.  Appreciate the offer to help.

You know in retrospect, withthe VAST quantity of items now available,
with all kinds of variations, I guess its not unfair to expect the
database to be down every once in a while.
