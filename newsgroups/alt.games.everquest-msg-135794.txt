Druids have the least efficient HP for mana heals, they are the last choice
to heal a canning shaman.  On the other hand, if you are FM and they are
quite LOM, it might make sense to toss them a heal so speed the process
up a bit.  Its all about getting the whole team to FM and FHP as fast
as possible, by any means necessary.  I've had druids, and even rangers,
heal me while I was modding up... whatever works.
