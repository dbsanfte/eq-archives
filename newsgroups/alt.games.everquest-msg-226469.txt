Oh yeah, that spell book.  It's useless in most group situations.  I've got
a weak heal that won't be worth a damn if there's a shaman or a druid in the
group, let alone a cleric.  I've got buffs that are overwritten by a cleric,
so are absolutely useless in a raid.  I've got a rez that no one wants
because it's not as good as a cleric's.  And I've got a pacify line of
spells, just like clerics, druids, rangers, and bards.  Sorry, we'll pass on
paladins, and pick up someone that actually brings something to the group.
Better luck next time, Paladin01.

Rangers have a role, DPS.

Or do anything else, for that matter.
