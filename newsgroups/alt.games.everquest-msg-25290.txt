Which was trivial for my druid to cross at some ridiculously low level.  I
really wanted that Coldain Velium Scimitar.  Then I created my warrior, and
had to go back and get another weapon for him too.  But, I did not beg when
I got there, and I can't imagine anyone going through all the trouble of
going there in order to beg.
