Since I can NEVER remember how the 2hs delay bonus goes, I have written 
down the info from the patch message in which it was introduced:

"2h weapons with delay under 28 had their damage bonus reduced. Weapons 28 
to 39 stayed the same, with those above 40 getting an increase."

(I think I recall he corrected himself to say "40 and above" rather than 
"above 40").

perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
