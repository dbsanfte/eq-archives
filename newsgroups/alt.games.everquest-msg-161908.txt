If you're useless as a Ranger then what makes you think you'll not
be equally useless as [insert class here]?  I'm quite serious btw,
not only do Rangers outdamage Warriors and Knights, but they have
buffs that improve their own and others' damage output, a buff that
reduces the hate they generate, a few handy utility spells, and a
Tracking ability that's head and shoulders superior to the other
classes that get Track.  There are surely plenty of useless Rangers
out there (and useless examples of every other class besides), but
the class itself is hardly useless.
