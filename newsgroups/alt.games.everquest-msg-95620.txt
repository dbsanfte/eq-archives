These are, indeed, the best moneymakers for newbies, and there still
seem to be lots of upper level folks willing to contribute. When I
started my leezard warrior on Innoruuk I was a penniless, naked newb. 
But I saved every single bone chip I looted, and every silk (combining
them into swatches on the loom in Cabilis since it never fails and they
stack nicely.)  Sold the stacks of swatches for up to 40 PP per stack,
and I've gotten as much as 10 PP per stack for bone chips from soft
skins wanting to do the Trooper Modo quest for faction. Made enough to
be in full banded by level 12, and I have over a hundred plat beyond
that in the bank at level sixteen. Never begged, never had to. And I'm
richer than ANY of my first characters were on my primary play server by
a LONG shot at that level, or many levels after that, in fact.
