	STR makes a negligible difference on average damage, even for
extremely high values. AGI and DEX are nigh on useless. I'd worry about
getting AGI to 100, but that's about it, and that's trivial with a couple
pieces of gear. DEX makes almost no difference until you get a weapon worth
proccing (which is pretty much just primal, which gives you 100 DEX anyway).

	If I could do it all over again, I'd put almost all of my points into
STA. Wouldn't make much of a difference, though, since you only get 4 points
per STA at 60, but it makes more sense there than anywhere else.

	Stats don't mean much. Gear, especially at the upper levels, will
more than compensate for any choices you make when rolling your character. At
the lower levels the stats make almost no difference, anyway, so you really
can't lose.
