Its hard to imagine why they'd be *that* concerned about exploits in a
game where at most 8 people can play together, and if you find your
mates are cheaters you can just create a new game instance.

Its also hard to imagine how they'd have the same cash resources
dedicated to fixing bugs on a game that people just buy and play for
free on that they would for a mmorpg.

And finally its hard to point at Blizzards "inability to fix expoits
and duping bugs" in D2 as a deal-breaker for WoW when you accept the
somewhat dismal postion SOE is in... billions of pp and items for sale
on the web  and  most of it suspect. And no clear commitment to
players that this is something they are seriously even trying to fix
it. If you accept that position from SOE its incongruous to demand
better from Blizzard.
