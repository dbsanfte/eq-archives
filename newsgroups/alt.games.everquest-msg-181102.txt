And, of course, you speak for the rest of the world because you can
read the minds of the masses.

In my experience, the only people who DON'T care about names are the
ones who have the stupid names... Others are annoyed by them, but
don't feel it's worth the effort to report the names because it
doesn't seem to get results. Others have seen results by being
persistant (Keep the bad name "fresh" on the list of names and hope
the GM is around at the same time they are).

In my experience, of course.

The only people who use terms like "name nazis" are jackass
anarchist-wannabes who think all rules are evil tools of "tha man".

In my experience, of course.
