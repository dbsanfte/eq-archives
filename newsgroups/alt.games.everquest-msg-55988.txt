Dunno if this holds for everyone, but a patch or two ago, they seemed to
change the lighting... anyway my erudite can see fine at nighttime without
any vision enhancement now... so Id go for erudite. Doesnt realy matter much
ince you can change form anyway. Erudite wont have to worry about illusion
in the OT. Start sucks a bit tho. Use paineel newbie area to get the first
few levels, and then maybe check the nearby areas. Been a while since i was
a newbie there, and I guess things may have changed a bit with the new
zones. By level 4 you can probably make it to freeport anyway if things are
deserted in Odus.

High elf would have the best start imo, and if you wanted a good start with
a non aligned race, you could even try gnome. Id still play an erudite. Make
sure you get your agility up to 75 tho.
