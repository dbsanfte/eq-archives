 There's really no set level. I would guess most monks would be safe to
leave once they get FD. I didn't leave Kunark until 46 or so and that
was only to start working on my Robe of the Lost Circle quest. You can
easily level to 60 without leaving Kunark. Well, easy if you have a set
group that you can count on. Otherwise the wandering route may be
better. Apparently Crystal Caverns is a good place to solo in the 30s.
