AAHHAHA thats funny.. Never seen something attacking her, a sand giant
would be great. She does riposite sometimes though but he'd have to be
attackin her from the front I guess. Someone in another post here
mentions getting riposited to death by a souldbinder, so I guess best
to attack them from behind.
