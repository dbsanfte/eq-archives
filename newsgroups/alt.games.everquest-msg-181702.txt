Once long-ago, some L60 something was telling me that group xp was
calculated like this:

Your share = (Your level / Total of group levels) * MobXp * NumberInGroup

So a group with L25, L27, L30:

L25 : (25/82) * 1000 * 3 ~ 900xp
L27 : (27/82) * 1000 * 3 ~ 990xp
L30 : (30/82) * 1000 * 3 ~ 1100xp

All shares are calculated when the battle starts, so removing members wont
change xp share.  So L60 gouping with L20 then leaving the group (pre-mob
death) would only yield the L20 : (20/80) * 1000 * 2 ~ 500xp.

Seems rather logical in the approach, and would make the "group bonus"
simply help round out the xp rather than penalize for grouping.
