His quest in PoK gives 2% exp 9 times in AA.  The 1% 9 times.  then nothing
mesurable.
That is.......  Until a server shut down and reset.  Then it is back to the
beginning.
Did 75% of a AA that way on the days I was bored and didn't feel up to
grinding.
Starting my next go round now.  32pp profit per trip isn't to bad really for
a low risk run.
Freeport is the only hot spot for me.  KOS.  Lucin of course.
