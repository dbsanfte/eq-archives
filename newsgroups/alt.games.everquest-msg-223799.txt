I'm a 51 Paladin. I've recently acquired Heavy Windrider's Lance, so I
want to build my Piercing skill, which is currently at 44. Ditto for
Devastating Maul...my 2-handed bashing skill is at 17.

What stats/buffs/equipment/techniques would help me to raise both
skills to the capped levels as quickly as possible?

I know that only XP-giving MOBs allow skillups. Since I solo more than
group, that means I'm fighting high blues, with the occasional boring
low blue.

I also assume that I only get skill increases for successful hits...at
40% class hit/miss, with a skill of 44, I'm sure not hitting very
often.

.../help?
