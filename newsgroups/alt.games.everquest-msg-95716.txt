Try turning it down to 3.0, then up to 9.0.  Then 1.0.  Just to be sure.

Hmm, there is a way to remove the cached textures, I'm sure someone here 
can tell you which files to remove.  I would turn off texture caching, 
remove the cached textures, and try again.

Also, since you are playing from Europe (I think) you might verify that 
you have decent bandwidth to Verant.  It's possible that you can't stay 
connected because there just isn't much available bandwidth, but I doubt 
that.
