Depends on the method.  Some methods leave the PL'ed character
largely "unpracticed".  For example:

1.  Put huge damage shields on PL lowbie.  Throw him into a room
full of mobs (preferably ones that don't run when they get low,
like for example a lot of undead).  Have him poke each mob for
even one point of damage each.  Stand there while the mobs beat
themselves to death on the damage shield, while healing the lowbie
as needed.  Rinse, repeat.  The lowbie isn't going to get many
fighting skills when he only hits once per kill on each mob.

2.  PL'ing a Bard (or other class that can Charm) can be done by
having a higher level character kill a yellow/red-to-the-bard
(and green to the PL'er) until it's a hair from death, then the 
Bard charms the mob, releases the mob, and smacks it a couple of
times until it keels over.  Charm clears the record of who previously
did damage to the mob, so the Bard gets full credit for the kill.
Again, not much opportunity for skillups.

And so on.
