Yeah, its mostly more of a pain, and you dont get paid nearly as well. Only
the designers make the big bucks usually, because they can pull down
royalties. Game companies know that a lot of people want to be game
programmers, so they get away with paying less. I've heard 10-15k less for a
starting game development position, as compared to other jobs.

Having said that, I'd still like to try it out. :P I know games best, and I
cant see myself enjoying a job where all I'd do is maintain a database or
years on end. I also dont know many programming companies beyond game
companies, so I dont even know where I'd sent my resume. Anyone hiring? :)
