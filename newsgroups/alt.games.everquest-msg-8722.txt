Probably to avoid people deliberately pulling vendors all over the
place. Doing some smithing? Train the ore vendor, mold vendor, and a
water vendor to the forge, root them, then zone out. Come back and
you've got smithing-from-your-couch, never need to move from one vendor
to the other. Same for other vendor bought tradeskills. Making specific
code for tradeskill vendors would probably be too tricky and not worth
it
