I have discovered in Wolf Form there is a greatly increased chance of an
interupt in some zones. This seems to be a side effect of the SOL 3D gaming
engine. In the Owlbear cave I would get interupted 50% of the time from
standing up and casting while in Wolf Form if I killed Wolf Form the problem
went away. I petitioned this and was told by a guide this seems to be a new
bug been getting several reports on it.
