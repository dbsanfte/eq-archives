Ok, letting you know. :)  Level 56.  Average unbuffed CHA had been about 150
until Verant acknowledged that CHA has very little affect on necro fear or
charm.

So my CHA is now in the mid 120s most of the time.  I may cast my new CHA
buff (50) if I'm expecting to have to mez stuff nearly my level or higher,
but then again, I might not...depends on if I remember.  I get very few
resists, and when I do, root works pretty well to get away to try another
mez.

Now, all that said, if I'm going to Hate I'll try to get CHA up to around
190...just because of superstition I think.  Lots of times it drops and I
don't notice for a while, so it's probably a wasted spell.  FINALLY at level
56 I can fairly regularly mez most of those damned creatures in that
zone...at 55 or 54 it was almost hopeless.

I think your relative level to the critter + their magic resistance makes
the biggest difference by far.  CHA only gives a little edge after those are
factored.  I SUSPECT that CHA over 110 (the merchant magic number) is a
waste, but I'm not going to do any hard tests on it. :)
