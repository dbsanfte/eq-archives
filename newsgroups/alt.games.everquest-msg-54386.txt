I was hoping to avoid travelling over the world looking for one piece
here, another there.  Yes, I'm sure I could twink up pretty nicely with
some effort, but thats not what I'm after really.

As it happens, I have a nice tunic (shardtooths flayed skin, if I recall
correctly)
and some other nice pieces, its just that in some other slots I'm wearing
store bought leather.

Legs?  Have the harness of control on me, all I need is some high level
friends
who happen to be on when the broodmother is up.
