    Have you ever looked at the names of rogues, especially alt rogues that
became mains? Two of the top four rogues on Quellious are Stabbz and Hits
Hardest (now Hits Noriega, GM name change). Half the people I meet can't
tell my rogue Rosy is a rogue because her name doesn't somehow refer to
stabbing.
