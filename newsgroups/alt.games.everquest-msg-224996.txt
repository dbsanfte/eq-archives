Oh, it could have been a lot weirder.  I tossed out a lot of stuff to
cut it to 10.  I could easily have included:

Joy to the World (Hoyt Axton)
Ride On
Don't be Stupid
Don't Fear the Reaper
Shambalah
Morning has Broken
Poisoning Pigeons in the Park
The Last Farewell
Old Man River
Big Iron

Hmm.  On second thought most of these are fairly contemplative, so
they do go together.

I did find it amusing that the people responding tend to put entire
albums or groups, instead of individual songs.  I rarely find an album
where I like everything on it, and I've never found a group where I
like everything they do/did.

The funny thing about my list is that each song generally gives me an
automatic response for another song that I'd include.  For instance, I
look at "Old Man River" and I automatically think of also listening to
"Bye Bye Love".  "Big Iron" for some reason triggers "Ballad of New
Orleans", and so on and so forth.
