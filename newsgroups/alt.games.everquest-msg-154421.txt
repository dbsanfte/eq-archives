Well here we agree... at least in part.  The flawed AC system
is at its worst regarding monks, who should have the worst
AC but instead have just as good AC as everyone else plus
the best avoidance.

Yes they can.  So monks get it all for that reason as well.  VI borked
that one up good.  Monks not supposed to wear tons of all/all
stuff way better than the "monk only" stuff; other classes actually
wear their class only items in many locations as the best gear they
can find.

No, I don't.  I mean that monks get AC if their weight is low.  AC that
adds to the AC on their gear.  If they wear monk only gear, this still
puts them in the bargain basement level of AC... but in a bunch of
plate level AC all/all wearable gear, along with this bonus, their AC
gets up in the same range as "real" tanks...

If he's hitting you for max damage, is he also hitting warriors for max damage?

If he hits monks in AC over 1250 for full damage, but warriors in AC over
1250 for only partial damage, then the whole arguement I'm making vanishes
like a house of cards in a hurricane.  But if he hits you and the warrior just
as hard, then AC doesn't matter for him, and only avoidance does.  In which
case its still advantage monk.

More I see on this the more I boggle at how bad the AC system
is, really.  Its not just the 1250 cap.  Its the fact that there's no
difference between a 300 AC and a 600 AC for an enchanter,
either.  AC should do something for more than a small target
slope of the line!

Would a functional AC system be that hard to design, or do
that much damage to the game as we know it?
