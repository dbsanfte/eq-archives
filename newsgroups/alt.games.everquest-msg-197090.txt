Instead of trying to convince your local bard, necro or SK...allo f
which might be kinda scarce at time in Gfay...you could go to the
vendor right outside the Ranger Guild and buy a chipped bone rod...

Chipped bone rods allow you to right click it, and it will turn you in
the direction of your corpse IIRC. Or it might just tell you that your
corpse is "Ahead and to the left", Behind and to the right", "Straight
ahead" kinda messages...but...buy a couple...and use the charges every
so often, and I assure you that you'll find your corpse fairly
quickly.
