    Snip story on guide making them roll for a contested spawn.

    They have always recognized contested spawns. Ragefire is classic. The
guide also realized that you need to resolve the problem before the spawn
pops and people start attacking.

    The rule is actually a little different from that. If a spawn is
contested and both sides have sufficient force to make a reasonable attempt,
and the two sides cannot come to an agreement on how to share, the GM may
impose whatever agreement on the spawn they wish. The guide could have told
both sides that none of you could be in the zone for a month had they so
chosen. The method most use to decide, though, is a random roll to determine
who gets first shot, second shot etc.

> 3rd, ragefire is now appearantly an official camp.

    Any mob can be petitioned as contested. Ragefire is just a well-known
spawn that is always contested.

    Actually, the guide didn't.

    Which will get you nowhere, as the guide was in the right. As for the
"can't do Ragefire with eight" that you're about to mention: my guild, and
quite a few others, could do him with a single party. If the party had the
right composition (the cleric, warrior, four manaburn-capable wizards) I
doubt you'd get a chance to blink before the dragon Ragefire hit the floor.
Our last Trakanon raid lasted just long enough for me to cast one group CH -
things don't live long when your wizards crit for 17000 damage.
