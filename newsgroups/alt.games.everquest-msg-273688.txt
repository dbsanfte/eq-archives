But you get paid handsomely by the dispatcher. 1g 8s at lvl 23 is at least
as much as I can typically get on the market for 10 of the weapons I can
make, and it's much less than it costs me to produce, because I cooperate
with a couple of guild mates who supply chemicals, staffs and pommels.

Furthermore, if I were to sell them myself, they would take up a lot of room
because they don't stack.

I find it much quicker to earn a living as a weaponsmith doing writs and
workshop orders than trying to sell my rather ordinary weapons myself. And
on top of that, I get status and faction points, and I help my society and,
one day, hopefully, when I'm worthy to become a patron, my guild.
