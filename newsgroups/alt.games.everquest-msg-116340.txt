If you have the ability to transport a level one zek worshipper to Kael to get
your
body, that is... and I agree in principle, there are no zones I can think of
where
you can't get your body one way or another.   Kael is less trivial than most,
thats
all I'm suggesting.

Aye, camp camp camp seems to me unquestionably a cheat... not that
I'm above using it, and I can swim past the Seahorses under DB. I'm
-often- travelling thru with people who don't know the way and its simply
easier to cheat em thru than to gate back, drag their bodies thru with DA up
(cause I already used DB the first time) and then rez em at the zone line.

That assumes you've already recovered your body... the question
at hand is where is it hard to recover your body from?  Deep in KK,
deep in the Grey... all alone without an EB caster handy.

OK, I'll grant you Air, although it still doesn't pass the "naked and alone"
test.

Really?  Oh that sucks.  I went to the trouble of dusting off my old
22 necro and buying him a copy of the spell so I'd have a body summoner
for group/raid/guild members (other than myself, since I can't target myself)
in a bad fix.  Oh well, back to the original "discard that character and make
a ranger to park near rare pop spawns" plan

And POG you can walk to under your own power at least
