He obviously flamed you, huh?  That seems to be his only purpose here.  I
have never seen a post by this donkey that actually serves of any use.  I
always get a laugh how he can't seem to be tolerant towards anyone.  If he
flames you in the future, no need to respond with this junk though.  He's
just an arrogant toad who thinks he owns this newsgroup.  The only one I
ever see that sides with him iis Lokari and she doesn't provide too much of
use anyway.  You can expect this in ANY newsgroup unfortunately.  Leave it
at that.

Hopefully that was enough to /taunt this dumbass donkey onto me, now sow up
and run!

P.S.  That picture was pretty gross.  Does she have a sister???
