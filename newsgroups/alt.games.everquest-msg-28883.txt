Hand a mod rod out to everyone in your group before you get started,
replentish as needed whenever you hit FM.  Yes, its an inefficient
storage device, but its the only one out there.  If you die, make
another set of rods for all the dead people near you... or if you happen

to be bound near the scene of death, get over there and drop -all- your
mana on the floor before you get a res.  You and the cleric should
both end up pretty close to FM and FHP...

But I do see what you mean, my complaint was largely that clerics
don't have mana supply on their own... while a single mod rod
worth of spare mana supply isn't all that huge a deal either.
