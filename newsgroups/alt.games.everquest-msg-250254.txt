I'd say it backs up the opinion of the people that have been saying
that all SOE is interested in now is milking EQ for as much cash as
possible before it starts it's major decline. 

I can hear the bitching now; "Sony nerfed the drop rate on a fungi
tunic so they could milk more cash from selling it!",  "I'm gonna sue
Sony for fraud cuz they just increased the drop rate of that fungi I
bought for $20 at the company store!", ... and I shudder to think at
the screaming if they ever nerf an item that they decided to sell. It
should all be quite entertaining <g>. 

Won't really matter I guess, when Sony gets into the business of
helping with cash transactions, I'll be gone. I can't think of
anything else more likely to just cause me to walk away from EQ.
