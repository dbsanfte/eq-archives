I have a baby druid at the moment at level 24 who has gone the AC/HP route
and finding it nice and easy. It has a fair whack of +mana on it so it makes
up for the low wisdom at present. I will be happy if it lasts me to 45
before I need to consider upgrading the focus items (mana conserve 2 on the
neck, ext afflict 2 on the boots) and ditch the haste gloves for +hp/mana  I
should be able to upgrade the earrings to POTC quest earrings, and hopefully
the bracelet of beauty to one of sense at the same time if finances permit
by then, I am in no hurry to level so should have the cash.

Currently in Marus Seru and she can mellee even con Greyhoppers down without
casting if completely oom so it's pretty useful.
