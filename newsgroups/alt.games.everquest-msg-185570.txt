You are misinterpreting, and comparing apples to oranges.  There are
advantages to the "slower" stun, larger radius and longer lasting -
using the shift and slant can get a full stun lock as well if you time
it right, where with flux and slant (or even more with shift) you have a
slight gap which allows the mob to beat on someone.  I used to always
have flux memed (exept vs. immune) but I found that at least half the
mobs in the places I'm fighting now have some good reach and can beat on
me without being in range of flux.  Would you rather cast a 1 second
cast time stun that doesn't even have the mobs in range or a 1.5 second
stun that does?  Therefore I don't use flux any more unless I *know* the
mobs have short arms.  The range is not an issue with root vs.
immobilize, immobilize does last longer than root as well.

Yeah I actually had this work for me yesterday.  my main problem with it
is I get myself about 1/2 the time when I am accidentally in the AE,
which happens about 1/2 the time when I use it.  My MR is about 125 as
well.  This is worse than using a single mez because all the mobs will
wake up when I do and start to beat on me instead of the MT, resulting
in nearly instantaneous death.  Even if I'm alone this is worse because
I just wasted the time to cast one spell.  I'm still not convinced it's
the right thing to do, but I'm going to experiment with it some more.
