Add to those:

Sebilis, Howling Stones, Siren's Grotto, Dragon Necropolis, Velk's Lab,
geos/sents in Wakening Lands, Guards in ThurgB upper or more mobs in the
basement, Dorfs in Great Divide (or if you're on dorf faction, lay waste
to the mobs in Kael), and of course, the new revamped Chardok. 

A highly skilled, well equipped 6-man high-50s group can also add
Western Wastes, Fear and Hate to the list, as well as tougher, less
travelled areas of the above zones like Juggs in Seb


Now compare this to pre-Kunark. You had the amazing choice of TWO zones
from 40-50: LGuk or SolB. As an ogre doing it before the existance of
shrink potions or cobalt bracers, yet after the guise nerf, I had the
choice reduced to LGuk or LGuk for 10 levels.
