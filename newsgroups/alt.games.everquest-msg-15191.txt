Hi,

Playing DE necro at lvl 14 i'm starting to look for a better weapon
but what should i get? i have now a fine steal great staff
that has dmg 9 and delay 37, it is a 2H blunt weapon.

And the armour side what is there that a necro can have,
i use cloth today, and i have a gray sr robe with ac 6 and +2 mana
also a festering cloak, the drop in poison and disease is somewhat
bad but i have since lvl 12 the spell endure disease.

I you have any ideas of weapon/armour that ain't rediculusly expensive
please tell me, everything seems too cost a couple of hundred pp and i
have managed to get 70pp in the bank, and they will go when i reach
lvl 16 and wan't the new spells.

I have been looking some at eq.casterrealm.com and found a staff that
sounded nice, enchanted fine steel great staff dmg 15 +4 int +4 wis
that should have an average cost of 330, rather high but better then
the 45000pp i saw for some staff, is this enchanted staff any good?

/Regards Berth aka Thotamon lvl 14 necro
