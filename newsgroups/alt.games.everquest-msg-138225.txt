No. There is a distinct difference in planning, trainig and
procurement. 

Transportable forces ( lighter tanks for example ) and a stressing of
the ability to transport them. The importance of expeditionary forces
( the USMC is more important than comparable bodies in "defensive"
armies). Rapid reaction/deployment capabilities. Supporting bases all
over the globe. Very long range bombers and stealth bombers. 

The US forces are constituted with the explicit goal ( though that is
changing ) of fighting two medium sized regional wars at large
distances from the homeland. The US has always taken the war to it's
enemies instead of defending its territory. And it is the better
choice if you can afford it but to call it defensive other than in the
abstract sense that a preemptive strike is the best defense is IMNSHO
tortuous logic. 

The US has an "offensive" army. One that is tuned to projecting force
around the globe. The europeans mostly have defensive armies, designed
to defend their territory against large scale invasion. The american
model has proven more successfull if more costly and the fact that
everyone is changing their focus to that of the americans should be
proof enough of that. The difficulty they have in making that change
and the costs they incur should also be proof enough that the two
types of armies are indeed different beasts.

Cheers!
