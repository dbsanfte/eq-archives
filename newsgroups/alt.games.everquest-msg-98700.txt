First of all I do not play high level on any characters and am only 31 on my
beasty so I am just shooting the breeze here ; )

I tend to think in wargame mode and unit types and view a beastmaster as a
"skirmish" class character - though I am unsure whether such tactics would
have any use in EQ. Limited use for harrassment, delaying and decoy tactics.
Not particularily useful in the front line - or any lines for that matter,
best to act independanty as the need arises.

Trying to tie that in with EQ is a bit hard - maybe an encounter where you
have to keep an area clear of somewhat lesser mobs they can act independant
or in small groups for that task?  Not exactly prestigous work but
definately useful.

A good think about Beasties is the sacrifical nature of the pet - it is
pretty tough and can take a lot of damage for something expendable. It is
also very cheap for the beasty to heal so can be used to absorb a large
amount of damage -> delaying actions? Retreats?

How about:

"shit - adds on the way - send in the beasties till we get a breather"
"repops due, see if the beasties can tie them up a tic till we finished
here"

*shrugs*

Just my uneducated guessing anyhow...
