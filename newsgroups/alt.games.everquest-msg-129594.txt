 Unless you can invis (and at that level not everyone can afford 11pp
invis potions) that's not really good advice. You'll be standing there a
long time waiting for someone who can invis you. Drawing a blank on all
the Iksar classes at the moment, but seems to me Shaman will be the only
ones to invis you. Necro maybe. SK is self only and Monk/Warrior sure
can't cast Invis.  No idea on BST.

 Guards run kinda fast and Crusaders have HT, so training them to FV
probably wouldn't work well either.

 But yeah, if you're a twink and money isn't really a problem, buy an
invis potion or two. The firepots are a fairly quick and painless way to
LOIO.
