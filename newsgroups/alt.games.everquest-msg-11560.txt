SOC speed?  I used it last night on my 34 wizard for about the 2nd time (my
magician got over its cuteness over a year ago...besides, you can't have it
and a pet at the same time :( ).  It sure didn't seem like it was going at
SOC speed...I was SOWed at the time and it seemed slower.

Crappy scouting tool unless you're next to a zone line ready to run when a
red notices the eye...if you use it that way it can be damned useful.   And
yeah, I can see using it as a pull tool, especially after you hit 35 and can
continue to med (I'm assuming you can, anyway...please correct me if I'm
wrong) while you're pulling.
