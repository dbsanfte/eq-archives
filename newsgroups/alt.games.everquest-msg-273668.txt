How the fuck would you get that impression? It's EVERYWHERE in the
game. Play for 5 minutes and you know that. There's tradeskilling info
on practically every info site for the game. Okay, sure, it's an
"impression"....but one that can only be come to by someone with his
head up his ass. Yeah, you're wrong...on something that's blatantly
obvious what the truth is for anyone who's taken any time to learn
about the game. It's an impression....but a completely uneducated and
ignorant one.
