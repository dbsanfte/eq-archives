    Dead on. It's all fun and games until a guild drops a tier. And unlike
all the Luclin content that will supposedly be re-tuned, your Velious
content won't get adjusted as it was pre-mod2. Welcome back to HoT, hope
they up the drops on the quest pieces so you have something to look forward
to.

    I have my doubts about Luclin re-tuning, too. They're two weeks away
from PoP release and half the expansion hasn't even been SEEN by
playtesters - how well tuned will Luclin be if they haven't even finished
PoP yet? I imagine the Luclin re-tune will involve hacking a chunk of HPs
off all the mobs, and little more. And that won't change the dynamics of any
of the fights, it just makes them shorter so people can go AFK more often.
