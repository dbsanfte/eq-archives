I know of some items which have a fantastically better selling price
than what you buy them from NPCS for:

Spiderling silk
Spider silk
bone chips

A druid is an especially good character to run all around and get
several hundred plat worth of that stuff.  Then the mule can be set up
in the bazaar with it overnight and have several hundred plat on it
when you wake up.

Or you could lose 10 percent of your money doing the "first it buys
the gem then the newb sells the gem to the npc, then it puts the
lotion in the bask..(oops)" thing.
