 That's something I was thinking of. Verant said they didn't want high
level people going in right away, clearinf the zones, and sending stuff
to spoiler sites. I don't support long-term TLC but I would support it
on new zones, even Luclin when it opens, if it were only used on a
non-permanent basis. I'm not sure two weeks is really enough. I'd
support two months. After two months turn off the TLC and let anyone
gain items from those zones.
