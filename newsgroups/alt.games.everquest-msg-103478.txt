Geesh!.  I was only joking.  In my little world it was just funny thinking
about adding something like that.  I do wish that Gnomes could make much
more cooler weapons.  Would be nice to bring a few catapults into the fight
against some of the larger mobs.  How about Gnome Flame Throwers?

And as for turning the game into a cheap Quake clone,  all of these weapons
would have a chance of malfunctioning.  Nothing like a little Gnome wearing
a Flame Thrower that blows up on his back.  His fire resist better be above
100.
