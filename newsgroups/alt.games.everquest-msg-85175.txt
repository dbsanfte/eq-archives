Dump Sygate.

Either use the built-in ICS (from Windows) or buy one
of those Linksys/Netear (RP114) router boxes (about
$60).

Personally, I'd take the router box, as that's one
extra layer of protection from the "outside world"
and we all know about Microsoft's history on
security (if you don't know about it, you should!)
