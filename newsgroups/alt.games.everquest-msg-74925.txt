I have a GForce3 too a Creative T200 and have no problems with the drivers
that came with it. Make sure ya using the latest version of DirectX, check
ya cards makers for a updated driver etc.

Probably done all that but the GForce does indeed rock =) And if ya gettinga
new motherboard etc make sure its a AGP 4 slot ;) Even better for gfx then
hehehe.
