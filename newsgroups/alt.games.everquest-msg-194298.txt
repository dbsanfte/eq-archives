Yes. You will have full access to both the UK and US servers.
However, your travel will be restricted to the "original" 3 continents.
For a month's free trial, that's pretty much all you need, depending
of course on how much you play :)

The original 3 continents are quite simple in design so don't tax your
system that much. Later expansion packs are more demanding but
I think the biggest limiting factor on performance is memory, and
300Mb should be fine.
