First, people can and do "munge" swear words to get around the filter.
"Fuck" will get filtered, but "F-uck" won't. Second, the filter is
horribly buggy. "Cockatrice" comes out munged, for example. Third, the
RULES OF THE FUCKING GAME say don't swear. The simple fact people
choose to ignore that rule (By a, say it with me, act of free will) is
offensive whether I can make out the word or not.

The words don't offend me, it's the total disrespect that the use of
the words in a place where the "hosts" have asked us not to use them
reflects. That said, I don't get mad on the first use of obscene
language from someone in the game. I usually respond with a polite
request to watch the language. Problem is, 9 times out of 10, the
person is a spoiled little child and will start telling me off,
usually using more obscene language. When this happens, yes, I get
mad. And yes, I /report and /petition. On the rare occasions where
they either say nothing but stop using the language or actually
apologize, I go on my merry way.

Verant has said time and time again that the /filter does NOT grant
people permission to use obscene language. No more so than bulletproof
vests grant people permission to go out and shoot people at random
(After all, people choose to go out without their vests by an act of
free will...). It's a "safety" measure, it's not license to ignore the
rules/laws.
