I wish i had as much whit as some other people, but I am left with what =
I have, nonetheless.

I was hunting Giants in the Warslik Woods fort with my bard who was =
level 29 at the time.  My method for fighting was snare a giant, pull it =
to the "safe spot" and then fear kite it while snared.  Well this =
usually goes pretty well for me, the giants seem to hardly resist at =
all, but on one occasion my snare broke and a giant trained back a =
friend on me.  Well the first one was almost dead so I finished it off =
and then preceded on the second one.  However, the second one was =
resisting a lot more then usual (of course don't they always), so i =
decided just to snare it run away and sit and heal with my song.  I did =
this a couple of times and had gotten it to about 1/3 life left.  I =
wanted to make sure I had plenty of life before the final round so once =
again I snared it and went and sat down to heal.  Of course the giant is =
still running at me with malice in his eyes and his life is at 1/3 when =
all of a sudden i get the message "you gain experience".  I stand up =
look around and there is a monk standing over the body of giant.  Before =
I even get a chance to speak he /shouts "Hey that was my kill"
Me: /boggle No it wasn't I had been kiting it for some time.
Him: "That's crap I pulled it way before you did.
(at this point I check this guys level to see what I am dealing with, =
/who monk_a ~ which returns 32 monk)
Me: Well i appreciate the help killing it but as you can see it was =
almost dead when you started attacking it.
Him: Was not!  It had full life when I first saw it.
(now i realize this situation could be a little tricky so I am going to =
try and be diplomatic)
Me:  Ok well there is an issue with EQ where if you are far away and con =
a monster it will always look like it has full life, so you might want =
to recheck the monsters health before attacking.
(all the while I am thinking wouldn't he notice that the monster didn't =
attack him back and that it died in 2 or 3 hits?)
Him: You are an a$$hole, I hate crap bards like you who go around =
killing everybody elses kills. You mother ...etc.etc.
Me: /ignore Monk_a
Me "Sorry to here about that, hopefully you have more luck Kill Stealing =
in the future!"

Ok ok so i know the last part was unnecessary but man some people urk =
me!
