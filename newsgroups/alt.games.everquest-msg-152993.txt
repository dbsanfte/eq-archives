Thank you for at least recognizing that AFK means "AWAY FROM KEYBOARD", as
in I need EQ to CLOSE while I AM NOT THERE!  Those who suggested EQW to
browse the web with are the ones I did not like, they apparently didn't read

running EQ at the same time.  The combination of the two programs might
work.
