And possibly more than enough.

From what I've seen on this thread, it's the ones who *don't* find
inspecting intrusive who could use a little time on the couch.  The
"intrusive" people are simply saying that they find it intrusive and
if you don't, that's also fine.

The "non-intrusive" people are the ones strutting around waving their
dicks in the air and calling people names.

He finds it intrusive.  You don't.  It should be painfully obvious
that this is a matter of personal opinion and neither one could
possibly be the _correct_ opinion.

A substantial percentage of people will continue to find inspecting
without asking impolite.  Deal.
