Sorry if I wasn't clear.  By "theft of an account", I meant the case where
the password has been changed, so the user is no longer able to log into the
account.  This is as opposed to "theft of items", which is a case I
discussed later in my post.  Under this definition, my argument stands.

However, in the case of a "stolen" account (by my definition above), neither
is anything further lost by the victim after the banning.  Hence, no
additional "punishment".  Can you agree on that much at least?

We can argue ad nauseum about what is the "perfect" analogy, but that only
detracts from the central argument.  But you're right, a better analogy
would be a policeman who sees two men fighting over a $100 bill, both
claiming to be the owner.  Unable (or unwilling) to determine the true
owner, the policeman takes the bill and destroys it, so it is of no value to
anyone.  The point is that whoever the rightful owner was, he has lost no
more that the $100 bill.  In any case, let's get on with discussing the
issue at hand, and quit quibbling over the relative validity of an infinite
number of silly analogies.

I disagree that it's entirely clear and unambiguous.  This is the type of
language that I think of as "amateur legal-ese"; it's meant to sound
unambiguous, but it has lots of holes.  Even the word "stolen" is subject to
interpretation; indeed you misinterpreted what I meant by "theft of an
account" above, which demonstrates that.

Furthermore what is a "compromised" account?  As I mentioned, suppose
someone uses my password and I lose all my items, but I can still log into
the account.  Suppose further that when I discover this, I change my
password before petitioning.  Hence, my account is no longer "compromised",
since whoever used the account without permission can no longer do so.

Finally, "will be banned" is patently ridiculous.  A legal document would, I
think, use "may be banned".  There are many instances of Verant
pronouncements that say "your account will be banned if you do such-and-so",
but we all know that these rules are not uniformly enforced across all
servers.

Yes, that's what the language says.  The question is this: will Verant apply
this "rule" uniformly and consistently in all cases?  If an innocent player
has his password cracked via some diabolical trojan, loses items as a
result, and petitions the GM, will the account be banned in each and every
case?  You apparently believe the answer is "yes"; I do not.

Is the language heavy-handed?  Certainly.  Is this something to get up in
arms about, and should we be concerned about innocent players who are
"punished" because their password was somehow comprimised?  In my opinion,
no.  Even if such a thing were to occur, there is no clear way to establish
the innocent from the not-so-innocent.  Only the victim knows whether he's
given the password out to others or not.

Let me ask you this: what do you believe are Verant's intentions and
motivations in making this proclamation?  What problem are they trying to
solve?  My understanding is that the type of "compromised account" they're
trying to target are those where the player has freely given their password
to someone else.  We all know there are many such instances: guilds with
shared mules, two or more people playing the same account so as to
powerlevel a character, and so on.  These things happen all the time, and
they're all clearly in violation of the EULA; but the EULA is an agreement
that most players seem to take as a joke, and which few players feel
genuinely obliged to honor.  Small wonder that Verant falls back on
draconian measures (or, at least, draconian language) to try to stop such
practices.

I've been playing for two years, and you can bet it would be a big deal.  As
I said in my post, if I petitioned due to lost items and had my account
banned for it, I'd be furious.  But I honestly do not believe that would
happen.  I also feel reasonably secure that my account will not be
compromised, since I've never given my password to anyone, and I take at
least minimal precautions to prevent virus infections.

So I'm certainly not about to delete all of my characters.  But if my
account were stolen (so that I could no longer log into it), and Verant
banned the account, do you know what I'd do?  I'd start a new account, and
start all over again, because I think EQ is just too much damn fun to do
without.  In that case, quite honestly my anger would be directed against
whoever stole the account, not at Verant.

Again, my argument was in the case of a "stolen" account (i.e. cannot log
into it any more).  In that case, the consequence would certainly hard to
swallow; but that doesn't make it "punishment."  Again, in this case, I'd
have lost nothing more by the banning than I had already lost by the theft.

That's the simplest case.  Suppose I've changed my e-mail address since I
created my account, but have not updated the info in EQ?  Happens quite
frequently, I suspect.  Again, the onus is on Verant to establish who the
"real" owner is.  This probably wouldn't be a big deal if it happened
infrequently to genuinely innocent customers.  Unfortunately it seems to
have grown into a problem, not due to hacking, but due to passwords not
being kept as secret as they should.

So what's the problem?  If your account is stolen, write Verant and claim
you've forgotten your password.  If you've lost items, then suck it up and
move on.

Only Verant knows that; we can only speculate.  But what would motivate
Verant to take such a stance?  I assert that it's because of an increasing
number of people who abuse the system by sharing accounts in violation of
the EULA.  You seem to believe it's because Verant is a buch of maniacal
sadists who have nothing better to do than piss off their paying customers.
Sorry, but I think my premise is far more likely.

If they already do that (or did that), they why would they change it?  The
obvious answer is that it is, in fact, subject to abuse in one way or
another.  Or at least, it's become a problem that occurs frequently enough
that they've chosen to resort to heavy-handed proclamations to stem the
tide.

You said above that they already have some way to handle "I forgot my
password".  If so, then what is the problem?  Verant has not said "we'll ban
people who lose their passwords" or "we'll ban people who claim to have lost
an item".  Why make the assumption that lost items are due to comprimised
accounts, rather than some other reason such as a database glitch?

No such thing is "clear" at all, at least not to me.  Ultimately the
decision whether to ban an account is up to a human being, not an automaton.
Specifically, it's up to the GM for the given server, who has reasonably
wide latitude in his ability to enforce such rules.  Or do you really
believe that all GMs are created equal, and enforce policies identically?
What Verant is trying to do, it seems, is solve what it sees as a problem by
using heavy-handed proclamations (not for the first time, and probably not
for the last).

But this isn't a statute enacted by some legislature.  It's a "policy"
declared by a gaming company, and enforced by individuals who, by all
accounts, do not necessarily respond identically to the same situation.

Heh heh, I doubt they'll double back and change their position.  However, I
also doubt that the application of this "rule" will be as uniform and
absolute as you make it out to be.

Point taken, and henceforth if I find my items missing I certainly will not
use the word "compromised" or "stolen" in my petition.  So for that, your
warning is appropriate and called for.

However, I still firmly believe that (1) the chances of my account being
compromised are very very small, given the minimal precautions that I take,
and (2) if my account were compromised and I lost items, the chances of my
being banned for it are very very small.  The innocent player whose password
is compromised is, I think, not the target of this proclamation.

If and when some poor soul gets his account banned because his account is
compromised and items are lost, then I'd agree that such action is unjust.
Provided, of course, that it could be demonstrated that the player in
question has truly done nothing to compromise the account himself (which
would be nigh on impossible to demonstrate conclusively).  Is it now prudent
to exercise greater caution when petitioning for this type of loss?
Certainly.  But is this something to get up in arms about here and now?  My
answer is: no.
