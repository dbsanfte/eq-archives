To be honest, I quite enjoy what relatively few do make it over here.  I
find, in general, that the British sitcoms are much better than the American
ones.  As for movies, well, there are good and bad from just about any
country.  I did have the advantage (well, if your interest is seeing shows
from a variety of countries) of living in Israel for a few years, and was
able to catch quite a few British shows.  We still get a number here,
usually on PBS, and many cable companies carry BBC (I think it's tailored to
the American market) as well.  It's not my fault that for some reason, the
companies that decide what to import over there choose the bilge they do,
must be some kind of a demand for it.
