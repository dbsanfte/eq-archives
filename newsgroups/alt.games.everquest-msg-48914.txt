Not quite.
Since Druids can only be neutral it is clear that they cant be good
Since Dark elves can't be good it is clear that they can't be good.

A Shaman can be NG or DG
A Barbarian can be NG or DG

So it is only when you choose alignment that you can't be these.

I agree that I would just have not listed them, but this does seem to be
the only case where the religion removes options.
In all other cases there is at least one religion that alowes you to be
any of the race/class alowable alignments.

Hth,

Jim
