Hi,

installed the game today on this computer:

Athlon 2600+ (Barton)
1 Gig running at 333 mhz (old mobo)
GeForce FX5200 128 Meg
Windows 2000 SP4
DX 9

Playing @ 1024x768 70Hz
Default setting

Game is running fine, only lag I have is when the computer has to load data
when entering a city. Graphics are good (not awesome) and way too cartoonish
(like Mario Bros or any of those Japanese game).

Game is still fun (level 5 scout), but I dont think its better than DAOC. No
RvR suck, and the game is too much like an Ever Quest for Dummies. Way too
much talking in towns from NPC, very annoying.

Ill take the 30 days and probably sell the account.

Oh, and I crashed once, while placing my table in my room. Had to press
reset on the computer.
