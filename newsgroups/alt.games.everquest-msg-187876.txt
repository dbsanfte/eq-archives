Nope thats about right - the quests really are designed to be done solo
between 5 and 10. My lvl 25 cleric is still in a fair few bits of his
newbie armour and uses his newbie stick (but then the gnome cleric one is
quite good).

At 7 you should be able to relatively easily start grabbing the bits for
the quest armour.
