To add to his question...
When a bard charms in a group and the charm breaks, does the mob tend
to go straight for the bard (like an unmezzed mob usually goes for the
enchanter) or will it normally engage the closest party member?

I have only used charm solo for fear of it turning on tanks or clerics
or whoever at just the wrong time.  If I knew it would come straight
for me, at least I would know the risk.
