Yes they are a mix.  They have better strength and stamina than anything but
an ogre or troll.  They can slam and they can wear medium or large.  By the
late game an ogre, troll, barbarian, or even an iksar or halfling warrior
can have 200 strength and stamina (maxed out) as far as I know.  They don't
see as well at night as an ogre or troll, but to make up for it they get
good faction and they level faster than those races due to the lack of the
racial experience penalty.  Any of the 3 you can't go wrong.
