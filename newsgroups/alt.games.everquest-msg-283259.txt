The soon-to-launch MMORPG "Dark and Light" is trying an interesting pricing
model (<http://www.darkandlight.com/>).  Haven't heard much about the game,
so I have no idea if it is any good.

The pricing model is that you can either get a monthly subscription for
$14.99, or you can buy 15 credits for $14.99.  When you run out of credits,
you can buy more.

Here's what consumes credits:

    1. Equiping an object that is above novice or apprentice level takes 1
    credit.  (This makes the item equippable by all characters on the
    account--so it looks like you only have to do this once per object.  It
    wouldn't keep consuming credits to swap back and forth between items).

    2. Learning a recipie that is above novice or apprentice level takes 5
    credits.

    3. Gaining access to some "realms" (which I think are like zones in EQ,
    except the game is zoneless, so not sure exactly how this works) takes
    10 credits/realm.

In addition, players without a subscription can't be a guild leader, fort
leader, or hold leader, can't get nobility titles, and are restricted to 20
levels of social XP (looks like the game is using a multi-axis XP system).

This seems like a good approach to take in a world where there are a lot of
viable MMORPGs.
