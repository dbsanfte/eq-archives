I think this is probably a good thing.  (although not when other people want
to use your account to play (then again, it's another argument for them getting
their own account))

Is this saying that when Luclin comes out they'll allow more than one char on
this server? I would expect that the other servers could be used to explore 
the new characters

This is nice.

This is nice.  When I checked there weren't different coloured nametags for
different teams (that may be because everyone was 1-5).  It will make it 
a bit easier for evil humans/gnomes/erudites to walk about their peers.

This is something they originally wanted - I'm glad it's being put into
practice somewhere.

Does this rule apply on the other PVP servers?
Some (good/possibly unforeseen) consequences of this...

You can't get rezzed until level 19 (CMIIW)
You can't get teleported to specific places until you're high enough.

IMO, you don't need either of these until you can get them - it will stop
lowbies whining at the zone (hopefully)

This has far reaching consequences...

a greater spirit says 'Greetings, shaman. Tell me, do you follow [Justice], 
[War], [Fear], or [Hate]?'
You say 'I follow [None of the Above]'

well, maybe _a_ far reaching consequence

They will also have to update imbued bits and pieces for MMarr.

They won't have to update imbued bits for Veeshan, because there isn't any
(that I'm aware of)
Poor dragon-hugging monks and bards.
