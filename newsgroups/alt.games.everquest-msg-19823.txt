Actually, I'd imagine that's how quite a few murders happen.  I'm not an
expert on the subject of murder (although occasionally I would have liked to
be) but I do know that it isn't the big bad things that get to you.  It's
whole bunches of little bad things one right after the other.  You know, you
oversleep and scrabble for the car, you miss breakfast, traffic delays make
it bumper to bumper on the way to work, other drivers badmouth you, there's
oppressive heat all the way, you get in a fender bender just outside the
office parking lot, the other guy has no insurance, some asshole has taken
your parking space, you get to work late, you are belittled and threatened
by your boss, your computer crashes, you run out of pencils, your attempt to
restart your computer crashes everyone else's computer, the air conditioning
breaks down and makes it even hotter inside than outside, you get saddled
with extra busywork, you drop lunch on the floor, the candy bar you had
instead of lunch makes you dash to the restroom to be violently ill, you get
puke on your favorite tie, the company president drops by and sees the mess
your cubicle has become as you try to work without a computer (he also gets
a good whiff of your tie), everyone sees the puke stain and how embarrassed
you are, they all have a good laugh about it, you get out hours late with
your computer still unfixed, you have a flat tire on the way home and you
don't have a spare.  And I'm not even being imaginative!  Something as
simple as a hello could be the straw that breaks the camel's back after a
day like that.
