Gorenaire in dreadlands . She should not be kos to you at 30 unless you are
in wolfform . She is also a very pretty dragon :)

As far as I know wolf form is a negative or no adjustment in all of velious
and kunark . It may still be a positive in unrest and mistmoor but i would
certainly consider a mob before getting to close .

Poa is a 46+ , pog is a 46+ but you are correct in that a karana worshipper
does not start out kos. I have no idea if pom is level restricted or not .
It is a seriously wicked place to get to with the full force of an uberguild
behind you and I doubt that more than just a few percentage of people will
ever see it .
