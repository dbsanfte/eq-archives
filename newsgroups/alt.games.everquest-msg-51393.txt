As a 60 rogue, my plan would be easy, and I don't see why folks farm HG's
for cash.

My MoD is no-drop, so I'd be fine with Dark Elf form in Oggok.  Get a bind.

Kill something, anything at all to make money for a second dagger.  My
Ragebringer is no-drop, as  well as a good haste item :-).  At 60, lizards
in
Cazic Thule are pitifully easy, drop plat, and anything over a Lizard
Defender carrying a weapon has fine steel.  One FS dagger or rapier,
then loot until I can't hold more.  Return to town to sell.  Over and over.
And over.

Actually, this is how I raise money now, with all my equipment still
on.  Nobody goes to CT, so I'm not hurting anyone.  Also, many of
the Ravenscale-dropping mobs are also trivially easy at 60, so I could
probably get my class-armor drops, too.  Except for the BP.

So yeah, I think I'd make out ok.

Again, I know half the challenge is not having weapons...but if anybody
would give up their epic for a "challenge," either they've been playing
EQ waaaaay too much and are jaded, or just plain insane.  Any
weapon paired with my epic is a good weapon for fighting critters
30 levels lower than me.
