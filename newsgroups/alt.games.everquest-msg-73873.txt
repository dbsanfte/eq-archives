Most certainly if you are seeking a true newbie.  Or someone who
doesnt twink.

I can recall a young Pally I helped get started by kind of teaching
him the ropes, giving him tips on how to make some money, etc.  We saw
each other daily for nearly 2 weeks  and got to know each other fairly
well as it seemed he ALWAYS had a question about equipment.

One day I see him in the tunnel in EC naked and said something to the
effect of "Corpse run huh?  Where did you die?".  He replied with "I
didnt, I just put all my stuff in bags to try and get some free
stuff."  

I told him I would keep that in mind.

"Oh, I would never do that to YOU." he says.

"Sure, sure you wouldn't."
