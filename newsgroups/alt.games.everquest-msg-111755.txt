And it heals the *exact* same amount of hp per mana as Chloroblast,
but with a detrimentally long cast time.

>Look at the mana/heal on Greater heal to Remedy, or Divine Light etc

GHeal (cleric): 300 hp for 150 mana in 3.75 sec - 2hp/mana
Remedy: 438 hp for 175 mana in 3 sec - 2.5 hp/mana
Divine light: 910 hp for 350 mana in 4.50 sec - 2.6 hp/mana

SupHeal (druid): 525 hp for 250 mana in 4.5 sec - 2.1 hp/mana
Chloroblast: 385 hp for 175 mana in 3 seconds: 2.2 hp/mana
Nature's Touch: 880 hp for 400 mana in 5.5 seconds: 2.2 hp/mana

What exactly was your point supposed to be?

Divine light is more mana efficient than Remedy, and it's a second
faster than Nature's Touch.

Nature's touch is NOT more mana efficient than Chloroblast, and it's
slower than superior healing. The great thing about getting
Chloroblast isn't that it's a slightly better ratio than sup heal, but
that it's FAST. With Nature's touch, that edge goes out the window,
and I am sure an enchanter would be impressed that I could heal 880
hps in one go on his corpse one tenth of a second after he was killed.

The slowness and knowing I'll get exactly as much healing done if I
cast chloroblast a few more times means NT isn't worth it for me.

By the time I hit 60, at least one of our clerics will probably have
mass group buffs, and we already have one with blessing of aego. 
I don't know how interested they'd be in fiddling around with buff
stacking, but I do want to make sure this alternate buffing is an
option if others than me would use it.
