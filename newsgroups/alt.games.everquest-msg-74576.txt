You're one lucky druid.  Particularly as this way will  take you within
aggro range of Gore if she's up and you're not on good terms with her.
(*cough* wolfform *cough*)

Safest way I've found to get from the hidden valley to any of the other
zones is to lev/sow/camo and as soon as you exit the tunnel hang a hard left
and follow the zone wall.  If you're headed for KC, then about when you
reach the BW zone, turn about 50 degrees right and run ahead (dodging dogs
and see invis spiders) until you get to the ruins.
