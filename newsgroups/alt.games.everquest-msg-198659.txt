After playing for a long time on the blue servers, some of my RL friends
have decided to try a PvP server. They have chosen Tallon Zek. Now I'm not
crazy about PvP but I do enjoy playing with these friends, so I thought
"what the heck". I did a Google search and found a bit about the server
specifics, but alot of what I could find was older so I have a few questions
Im hopeing some of you longtime Tallon Zekies can help me with:

1. What team did the Frogloks end up on?

2. I read that on Tallon Zek it was really evils vs everyone else, but the
page was 2 years old, is this still the case? Is there some unwritten
alliance between teams?

3. When does PvP really start? I started a new halfling just to look around
and saw all kinds of other team characters (barbarians and elves) running
around Misty Thicket. Do you try and defend your newbie areas? Does it
matter?

4. My buddies decided to be on the "shorties" team. Am I going to regret
this decision?

5. Any suggestion for a 3 person combo that would be good in PvP as far as
characters/good spells/good equipment to get?

I guess I'm also looking for any tips and such you can offer to a new player
on Talon Zek.

Thanks in advance,
Naphtoe
