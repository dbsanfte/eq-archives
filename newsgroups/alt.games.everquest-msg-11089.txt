	The Level Damage Bonus for 1-handers is [(Level - 25)/3].  So,
for example, from levels 28-31 your damage bonus is (28-25)/3 = 3/3 =
1.

	Now, 1 point of damage isn't a particularly impressive damage
bonus.  But 49th and 50th level characters got an 8-point damage
bonus.  What that meant is that every successful hit would do a
*minimum* of 9 points of damage.  And as it turned out, it did more
damage over time to use a fast 1-hander than to use a slow 2-hander.
Sure, the slow 2-hander had a higher damage.  But a slow 2-hander hits
for minimum damage with the same ratio as a fast 1-hander.  So if 20%
of your hits were going to be for minimum damage regardless of what
weapon you used, it was better to use a fast 1-hander and get more of
those minimum hits in less time.

	So yes, unless there's a big disparity between the DMG/DLY
ratio of your two weapons, it's almost always better to put the
fastest weapon in the primary hand.

	Note, however, that the offhand does *not* get a damage bonus
of any kind.  So the best weapon for the offhand is the weapon with
the highest DMG/DLY ratio.  (This is why the Wurmslayer would make
such an incredible offhand weapon.  25/40 is a great ratio.)
