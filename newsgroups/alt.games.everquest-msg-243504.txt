I'm sure quite a few of them are just playing the bazaar game. I can't
imagine what Keisl (infamous bazaar trader on Venril Sathir, whose current
stock is priced at around 4.5MPP) does with his cash unless he sells it.

The common argument against what he does is that by buying high end stuff
and reselling it at higher prices he forces people to buy PP to be able
to afford gear, but I don't buy it (the argument that is, although I don't
buy the plat either). If you don't want to pay his prices, don't buy. If
prices go up over the line, that means stuff you sell will fetch a higher
price as well. If you can't farm silk to buy uber gear, cry me a river.
There seem to be a lot of hate directed at resellers for driving prices up,
but at least they don't unbalance the game by introducing lots of PP into
the economy.

As long as they fix the obvious sploits and macroing the selling of PP for
real cash doesn't affect the game that much, although if you play in SOE's
playground they make the rules, of course. So the big problem isn't as much
the PP selling as the lack of quality control, imo.
