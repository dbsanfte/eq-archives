Shamans make them, they are not very good at level 1.  The damage shield is 
based on the level of the drinker of the potion, best one is (level/2)+1 
that lasts for (level/4) minutes.  In other words, at level one, it's a one 
or two point DS that lasts for less than a minute.  Costs 30ish pp per dose 
as I recall to make it, so expect to see it selling for 50ish pp per dose.  
I could be off on the cost, been a while since I made them.
