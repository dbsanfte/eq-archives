I got into the most fucked up conversation at work today with a guy.
(Bear in mind, he's a computer engineer, so I've no idea what his
background or expertise in food may or may not be.)

I had mentioned some joking reference in passing to hunting pigs with
truffles. Now, I guess I don't actually know this from anyplace, but for
whatever reason I've always been under the impressoin that they were
hunted up using pigs to sniff them out.

This fellow goes on to inform me that pigs were probably used in the
dark ages, but they are pretty much grown on farms now and harvested
with machines, and if anybody is digging them up with a pig, they are
doing it to put on a show for the tourists.

Is this true?

And if it is, why in the flaming fuck do they still cost so much,
assuming you can even FIND them if you don't live near a major city?
