See, now, I woulda gotten THAT one right.

I spent all my gaming time yesterday re-camping the ratonga that drops
the music box, only to discover that the game KNEW I'd done the quest
already, so wouldn't let me re-examine the new music box.

ARgh.  Interestingly, it lets me keep the music box afterwards...so I
wonder if it is something that can go in my apartment. Which...will have
to wait until I finish betraying Freeport. Argh again.

So if anyone else does this quest (you kill Ringleader RAdko in the Ruins
to start it), tell Lucilla right off that you won't help her if she uses
that tone of voice, and let me know if it goes better for you. :/
