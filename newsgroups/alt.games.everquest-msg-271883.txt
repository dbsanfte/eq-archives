Zones aren't acknowledged by the game itself. Just as the characters in 
the books aren't aware of where the paragraph and chapter breaks are in 
the book the EQ lore presented in game is oblivious to the Zone lines.

There is nothing about zone lines that makes them impossible to 
integrate into the lore of the game. But they haven't been.

See the difference?
