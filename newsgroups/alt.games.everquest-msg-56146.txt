    Test has introduced the ability to play as a monster, just goto the =
character creation screen and in the upper tight hand corner there is a =
button marked monster. You will spawn as a random monster in a random =
zone BUT your LvL will not be higher then 15, and you cannot loot, or =
Talk. Attacking other NPC runes still apply, some people told me that =
got there Rat to LvL 5, you can attack anything including players, kind =
of fun to supprised a newbie. If it goes Live, it will only be on PvP =
servers, your monster comes with the regular dropped loot and casters =
will have a spell book with all there current LvL spells.

    You don't want to zone as it will knock you back to character =
creation screen, as will getting killed. But they haven't cleaned up the =
corps decay so in some areas there are corps that have player decay =
times.
