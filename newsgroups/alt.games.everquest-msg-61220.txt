I was wondering if it was possible to transfer a character from one =
account to another....

I am about to sign up for a 2nd EQ account and possibly get a 2nd =
computer and was wanting to have a character already on that account....

is it possible?

And if so, what is transfered and what isn't?  no-drop stuff?


Thanks in advance....

Vj
