Let's take a look at it a different way.

The couple dozen people in Verant think of something they think is cool.
They test it with a couple hundred and they think it's cool too.

Then they give it to a few hundred thousand players, and they think it's
cool too...and since 300,000 people have more total imagination than 200
people, they think of things to do that the originals didn't.

Ok, let's now aim it a little closer to home.

Some idiot with no imagination posts a stupid little flame against Verant.
The rest of us reply to your post wondering why - since you play the game -
you hadn't already realized how stupid your post would be.
