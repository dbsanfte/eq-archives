Depending on your level, you can also kill the troll Mercenaries in WL
(north wall between Rolandal and KD) on your way to SS. Each drops a brooch
which you can hand (three of) into the barbarian upstairs in SS. In return
you get faction and a handy Draconic Rage potion, which has 5 charges of
Draconic Rage - this adds a 65 fire DD proc to your attacks. The mercenaries
can also be found near the prison in EW. They are light blue/green to level
60. The faction hits are quite good I think. Rolandal is nearby so you can
check your CoV faction while running to SS.
