I am 20th level Enchanter.  I swear that must have been me telling you
to use /assist.  How funny it is to find this in the newsgroup!

I can' tell you how frustrating it is to try to teach people to use
/assist   ...it is SO good.

You can use /assist two ways.

One is to target someone (the puller) and click your social button you
created for /assist.  This will change YOUR target to the puller's
target and will turn auto attack on.

A different method is to edit your social button each time you join a
group to:
/assist TankGirl
where TankGirl is the name of the person who is pulling.  This way,
you don't have to target the puller.  You do have to wait for him to
attack the next mob, however.  This is GOOD though.

THEN use /pet attack.  This will send your pet to the new target.
