Payers aren't Asian, African, or any other race...they're people behind the
printed names.

Asians cannot be barred access due to their race...that's a Civil Rights
law.

Take a look at http://www.maec.org/laws/1991cra.html.  If you see the part
that supports that you have the Right to rent time from a private company,
get back to us.  Until then, shut up.
