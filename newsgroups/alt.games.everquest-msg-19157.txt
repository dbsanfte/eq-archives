if anyone here plays on Sullon Zek they know how bad Blackburrow has
been since the opening of the server.  The amount of people in BB have
created so many trains that the pathing of everything inside is screwed
up to the point where the music really scares me :).  Anyway, I was
fighting there with a group of 5 and we were fighting burlies on the
second floor.  And we get a few extra adds and 2 people die.  Then we
run out and hit at least 15 other gnolls on their way back from the
train station.  No biggie, we all make it.  But one of the guys who died
dropped the group and went to get his corpse himself.  Then the leader
went LD and another guy dropped, so it's me and a rogue's corpse in
Blackburrow.  And he's trying to get it back.  So we both go in, and he
dies again because, as usual, we get trained with guardsman and elites
and we're both only level 7.  So, he dies running and run without
dying.  So, now my buddy rogue here has 2 corpses in BB and we never
even made it down to the bridge since he died the first time.  So I tell
him to consent me and I'll go get his corpse. Ummmm...... yeah right.
Everything down there is still blue to me and they'll aggro on me.  So I
decided to take out each gnoll one at a time, and I'm a shaman.  So I
kill 2 and there's still 3 left, which all con white and 2 aggro on me,
ouch.  Someone helps me out, YEAH!.  I get the corpse, with about half
my hp's left and start heading for the (Qeynos) Hills.  On my way back,
you guessed it, TRAIN!!  And I somehow attract the attention of an elite
guardsman and he's just wailing on me.  I see my rogue friend I drop the
corpse at his feet and run(limp in absolute desperation) to the zone.  I
was knocked unconscious 3 times, I regained 3 times, and zoned with 2hp
left.  I zoned in and /em stares in awe at his bloodied and broken
form.  It was amazing.  The rogue gave me the biggest compliments about
me risking my neck for him and all that.  I felt special.
