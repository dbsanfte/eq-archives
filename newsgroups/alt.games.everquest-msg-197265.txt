I love the fact that people can offer their opinions. I would love it 
even more if they were not so quickly discounted due to level. Btw, no 
one ever said people can just waltz right through the trials. You're 
taking issue with words *you* are trying to put in my mouth.

You *should* be more than willing to give up some (not an unnecessarily 
high amount) 2nd tier playing time to get more of your guild flagged.

The guild should not expect most of your time for this, just some of it. 
If everyone who got flagged devoted just a small portion of their time to 
helping others get flagged, they would need to contribute less and less 
as more got flagged.

Those are the same people that are *causing* the problem, in addition to 
the faults of the trials themselves, of course.

The trials need fixed, not removed.
