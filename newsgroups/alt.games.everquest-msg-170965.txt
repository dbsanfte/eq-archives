Let me clarify.  What I mean is a department whose function is to gather
information regarding threats from outside to this nation and to find
effective solutions to those problems.  I don't mean a department who spies
on American citizens or residents in a "Big Brother" way to find internal
dissent.  "Homeland Security" can be taken to mean either protecting the
homeland from outside threats or protecting the homeland's government from
internal threats.  I agree with the first goal, but not the second, and it
seems the new department is here for the second goal.

I'm sure I'll hear a lot of irate posts about this, but personally I think
I'd rather have the World Trade Center blown up than see America become a
Nazilike state.  And although I don't think the American people would stand
for something like that, it looks like the "Department of Homeland Security"
is gradually trying to become an American Gestapo.  I find it unsettling.

That is not to say I wouldn't enjoy seeing Osama bin Laden suffer in
extraordinary ways for what he did -- nothing would please me more.  For
some reason I can't find it in me to like the guy much.

I'm not saying that the government should fix your life if you destroy it
with drugs... but if they're really so eager to help, they would do a lot
more good trying to provide therapy for users than fighting this stupid war.

/agree heartily
This is precisely what I was trying to say in my previous posts... a parent
has every right to express their opinions and moral values to their
children, and that is the way they should raise their kids.  Trying to
prevent them from having condoms is not an acceptable way to convince them
not to have sex.

For Sanjian's benefit:  As you may notice if you read my previous posts, I
never said you don't have the right to impress your moral values on your
kid.  As a matter of fact, I think that's your duty as a parent, even if I
don't agree with said moral values.  What I disagree with is your desire to
force your moral values by increasing the probability that he will be
seriously harmed if he doesn't follow your advice.  That's like telling your
kid not to ride your motorcycle because he might get hurt, then putting
pointed stakes in your driveway while he's asleep so if he gets up and tries
it, he'll be impaled if he doesn't look first.

All right, Remington, I guess I should apologize to you.  I kind of flew off
the handle there because what you said is almost word-for-word what my
father used to say, and he was the type of guy who would "administer a
bone-breaking belt-whupping for asking "why?" to everything you say for half
an hour."  Oh, yes, and he was also a fine, upstanding, fundamentalist
Christian gentleman, just like our friend Sanjian.

But I get the impression that you're talking about laws against spanking and
such, and you do care about raising your kids properly.  So... sorry I
blasted you :)  It's a rather sensitive subject for me, or I would have been
more reasonable about it.  However, I'll always believe the government has
every right to take your kids away if you're administering regular
bone-breaking belt-whuppings to them.

I'm not sure what you mean by "we are there for us."  You'll have to
elaborate.  I don't follow the Republican Party platform, or any other
platform for that matter, for my personal moral and family values.  I
determine my own values according to what seems appropriate to me, and if I
am wrong, I'll take the consequences.  But what I meant by the above
statement is that you are there to take care of your kids and raise them to
be healthy and mature, they are not there for the purpose of being model
kids for you to show off, like some people I've known seem to think.

lol... I'm glad *someone* seems to think what I said makes sense...
