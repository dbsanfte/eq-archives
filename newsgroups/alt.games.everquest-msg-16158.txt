Actually all the cats my druid runs across in EC/WC all con dubious, do you
kill them too?  So now we will have a huge bear and wolf population because
you won't kill them.  Oh great, now there are starving wolves and bears
because of over population and lack of food.  Good job Mr. Druid/Ranger!!



P.S.  You don't have any bear by-products in your inventory do you?
