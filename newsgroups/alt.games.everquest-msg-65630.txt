WARNING: Shot in the dark

Perhaps this spell works in a way that you cannot see in numbers on the 
screen or little blue bars. Perhaps this spell works like a reverse-tash, 
giving you an extra level or something for the purpose of calculating 
resists to your spells?

Tash is another of the (MANY) spells Chanters get that are subtle.

to me, I'll just have to do it in person.)" -Walker
