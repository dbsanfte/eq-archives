Because that's when the big mobs are guaranteed to spawn, and if you don't
get them, someone else will.

I'm no VAK, but I have to take issue with these statements.  We don't KNOW
anything of the sort, nor are any of these an absolute certainty.

Yes, patches have lasted longer than the stated downtime, but most of the
time they don't.  But nobody remembers those, only the times when the server
wasn't available.  Yes, there are often unexpected problems, but most of
them go pretty smoothly.  The servers seem to crash on their own whether
there's a patch or not.  And this is the first patch in a while that's
required an immediate followup patch.

We don't *know* the game will be unstable.  And since most patches go off
without a hitch, WHY NOT?

Exactly, but don't let that stop you from crossing the street if that's
where you want to go.
