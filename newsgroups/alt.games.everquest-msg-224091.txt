Nope.  Need an account key.  Pure and simple, no way around that, no hack,
no key generator, nothing.

The good news is that for only $29.99 you can get an account key that's good
for all expansions.  If you're not certain you wanna do EQ, you can pay
$9.99 and get an account key good for the original trilogy.  Then you can
try it free for 30 days and decide if you wanna play beyond that.

Absolutely not.  We have many exceptionally bright women as well.
