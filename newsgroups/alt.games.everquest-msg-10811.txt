Hello all,

I have been away from the game for some time. I have a level 30 Druid plus a
number of other characters from levels 1 - 30 and am in search of a Guild to
join on the Bertoxxulous server. I would prefer a small guild, as they seem
to be the ones that tend to have more fun when forming hunting parties. If
anyone has any information on such guilds please let me know.

Peter
