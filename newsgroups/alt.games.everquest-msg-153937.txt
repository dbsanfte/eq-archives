Well, in three and a half years they never thought it was even
worth it to enable female wood elves having a robe. If you look
at the models on startup, the old ones that is, you'll see that the
femal wood elf and dark elf have what look to be the exact same 3d
polygon model (at least for the body especially)

If they were going to make that model, and other ones like Ogre
robeable, they would have by now. They never have and its probably why
you never see a GOOD druid robe (since it would be human only) or a
great cleric robe.

AO did a lot better job with clothing that could be worn by anyone. It
all shapes to fit any model so you can have some huge atrox thing in a
bikini or oriental dress, rather than having a particular texture for
a particular mode.
