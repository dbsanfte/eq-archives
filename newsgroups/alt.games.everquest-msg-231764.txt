	I always give away minor focus items like ivy cords and grass rings
as well as nice but too-low weapons like velium etched maces.  I've
decided that something like that makes a great difference to a young character
and simply isn't something they'll be able to achieve before it's useless
to them.  Quests or no quests.

	I started EQ about 8 months ago at the urging of a friend who's
a long time (multiple 65's) player.  Except for an othmir cap and a combine
morning star for my new druid I got no twinks.  I enjoyed "exploring and
getting those minor quest upgrades" until about level 32, when I realized
I needed a 5 minute break between blues for mana regen and the +1ac/+2wis
stuff I was picking up after questing simply wasn't helping me enjoy playing.
So Sue laid a Band of Twilight, a BAM, and one or two other things on me.
It made the game ever so much more enjoyable, simply because it cut the time
I spent sitting on my ass by like 50%.  Know what?  I started "enjoying 
exploring and getting those minor quest upgrades" again.
