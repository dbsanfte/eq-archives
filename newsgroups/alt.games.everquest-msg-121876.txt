Did you by any chance back up your EQ directory to a CD-ROM and
then restore it?  That'll often leave your files read-only,
and will cause symptoms like this.

Make sure your *.ini files aren't tagged readonly, and if you're
on an NT/XP system make sure the EQ directory and those files
are marked as writeable.
