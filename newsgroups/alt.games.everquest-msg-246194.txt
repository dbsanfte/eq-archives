Thank you for all the responses, folks. I had never thought of taking a lava
bath, but it sure did the trick last night!

Now, do you all think it's worth it for healer types to get their bind
wounds trivial up there? I know, personally, I've been in hard ldon's where
my mana is flat out gone and it's the only way I have left of healing the
tank. I'm with the thought of using any means necessary to get the job done
(healing).
