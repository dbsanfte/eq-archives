As a paladin slightly more seasoned than you, I think you need to remember
the golden rule of paladins. We don't solo.
Sure you could if you had some nice twink gear or were going against really
low blues, but you're going to have down time from healing.
If you are willing to make the boat ride to Kunark, I'd recommend LOIO and
then FM. If you are looking to do it solo, I'd recommend pulling sarnaks off
the tower in LOIO closest to the FM zone. If' you are good, you can pull 1
recruit at a time. There are also the wandering goblin warlords, undead
icebones of various kinds and the occassional sabertooth grimalk. If you get
into trouble, you can zone into FM.
But if you are looking to level and get the XP as fast as you can, I'd
recommend getting into a "platform" group inside the Sarnak Fort in LOIO.
Once you hit 30 or about, head over to the next zone, FM, and group up to
hunt giants at the giant fort. You won't be able to solo these, but if you
group, the XP should be very good.
If you head out that way, get a bind in FV and stock up on provisions. There
are no banks, food or water merchants in the LOIO or FM zone. Its a loong
run back to FV and you have to go across drachnids (very nasty, but very
small aggro range).
If you DON'T want to make the boat trip out to Kunark, I'd recommend the
spires in SK. I don't know how camped these spires are on your server, but
on mine, a L26 pally can generally find a group no prob. Once you get a few
more levels, you could go into Split Paw itself and hunt there for a few
more levels. Again, when in Split Paw, you're going to want to group.

Well that's my 2 coppers. Take it or leave it. Hope it helps.
