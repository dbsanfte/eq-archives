What new tax for the dial up - dial up services have been adding VAT for
years. Ive had a Demon account for 10 year now and VAT has been there for
all that time....the only new bit is that digital services coming into the
country are now being enforced on and since that has been present for
goods and services entering since sales taxes were added

> Really sucks dont it?

Like most places noone actually get s a thrill out of paying tax on
anything but most recognise the basic necessity for paying such things
even if they might argue over how it is spent by the authorities. I dont
know many places that arent a little strange on tax in general that dont
offer some form of sales tax for the paying public to 'enjoy'

Because the legislation was nothing more than filling a loophole in the
UK and EU and to be honest could probably have been charged under our
previous legislation. If the transaction and all is entirely dealt with
abroad then the VAT doesnt happen simple as that - cross the border and
you get stung - so if you can get a Jersey based account and address to
pay from go for it for the UK.
