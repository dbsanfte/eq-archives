Yeah, it probably is, but that's not relevant to what I've been talking
about...

Ah, so that's the problem.  NO, that's NOT what we're talking about.
You're talking about the waiter who waits on a table with a $300
bill that tips $2, and, yes, that's not "right."

But here's the simple question:  did the people who spent $300 on
food get their food?  Yes, they did.  No one "tips" before receiving
the service.  And, more importantly, did the waiter then turn around
and tell the person who left the $2 tip they were cheapskates?
Certainly not, at least if they want to keep their job.   Did the waiter
go bitch to his friends about it?   Probably, but that's hardly relevant.

When you "port for donations" you port for tips.  It's the same principle.
Some people will stiff you;  it's a fact of life.   Some people will
over-tip,
too;  that's another fact of life.  Most people, though, will pay the going
rate.

If you're not willing to port for tips, don't do so.  Plenty of porters
negotiate their price up-front.   But it IS dishonest to say you're
"porting for donations" when you're actually porting for a fee.  IMO,
if you say "porting for donations" but won't take the people who
will stiff you, you're false advertising.   And, again IMO, you're just
greedy for only taking the people who pay >= the set rate.

Let me put it this way:  as my cleric, I get plenty of rez requests.
If the person is nearby and/or has the corpse dragged to me, I'll
rez them without negotiating a price up-front.   They "pay" whatever
they like.   I might think the guy who gives me 5pp is a cheapskate
but he *still* got his rez.   And I might think the guy who gives me
12kpp is over-doing it, but he still gets his rez too.  (And, yes, I once
was offered an item that sells for 12kpp for doing a *revive* in EC.
I didn't take it, though; I wouldn't have used the item.)   The bottom
line, though, is that *they still get their rez* if I'm willing to do it at
all.
And, yes, I expect the same thing from any porter who says they're
willing to port for donations.

Again, it's a fundamental difference.  IMO, "porting for donations" is
the same as "porting for tips."   You're bound to get mostly the going
rate, but some people will over-tip and some people will stiff you.
If you're not willing to take the people who stiff you, you're not *really*
porting for donations;  you're porting for a set fee but will take more
if the person will pay it.  And, yes, that IS fundamentally dishonest,
at least in the advertising.
