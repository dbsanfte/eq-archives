I'm inclined to agree that Brad is willing to compromise in this case.
It appears from what I can see, and the fact that Brad is posting this
thread publically, that Verant is looking to find a solution that lets
all parties save a bit of face.  
I personally think that Verant made an error in judgement, and then
went into damage control mode without thinking things through.  I also
KNOW that high-level guilds come up with all sorts of ways to get
around obstacles that Verant builds into the zones.  
I have a very hard time understanding why someone would be upset if
Verant agreed to lessen the punishment in this case.  The way I read
it the reason to be under the bridge was to be out of LOS of the
breath weapon, which is a tactic that is commonly used on a variety of
MOBs.  Verant thought that the reason was to be in a spot where you
couldn't be summoned, but I don't see anything to indicate that
Conquest knew about that safe spot.  For some high-level players and
guilds, the fun part is finding ways to defeat tough mobs without
resorting to a Zerg-rush.  (Of course, sometimes a Zerg-rush is the
appropriate answer, i.e. the Queen in Chardok.)  Using rez effects and
the like is just good tactics in my mind, and I honestly don't see
much difference in that and leaving the first buff spot open so that
you can dispell/pumice DoTs cast by the mob.

still trying to figure out how to keep 3 songs up AND leave that damn
first buff slot open
