I don't recall seeing an abundance of iksar anywhere...  I haven't actually 
gone on any of the ships in Dulak (the characters I'm taking through LoY 
are both mid-40s and I tend to just two-box or trio with my girlfriend's 
monk when she plays), just heard that one of 'em is full of iksar.  I know 
for sure that Nadox is full of trolls.  Some of the gunthak forts might 
have a few iksar in 'em.  Torgiran maybe?
