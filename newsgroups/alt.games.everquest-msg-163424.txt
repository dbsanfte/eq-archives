My mage has had a Burnt Wood staff for a long time, but I didn't
use it much, because the 13.5 second cast time meant that I was,
essentially, using 2-3 ticks worth of medding mana per cast.

Then I got a horse :)  Now I start casting the BWS the moment
the mob is engaged, then switch to a regular nuke or 2 later in
the fight.  The other day in the goblin caves I mostly stayed
80mana and above, while nuking constantly.

Not just a cleric - any caster who's going to generate some serious
aggro, and needs to med.  Used to be I'd have to wait a 10 count to
sit again after sending my pet in - 2 more ticks wasted.

This is where I'm lucky - I've had all Luclin models turned off from the
get go (except Vah Shir) for performance (plus some, like the new
elementals, are just plain ugly) so I get the standing regen advantage
of the horse but none of the disadvantages (slow start stop, slow
strafe).  You do have to cast a spell to force your mana bar to update,
but T-Boots work well for that.
