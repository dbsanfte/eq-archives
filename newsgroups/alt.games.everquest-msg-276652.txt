Actually, I thought the real question was why the hell the "GM" responded as 
they did to his inquiry. He wasn't complaining, he wasn't even citing a 
need, he was simply asking if the current spawn was working as intended. The 
issue presented by his post is the stupid, unanswerable non-sequitir of a 
response and the idiocy it reveals. This is customer service?
