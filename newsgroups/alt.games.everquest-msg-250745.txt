You can use sneak to become indifferent to merchants and quest givers.
This is useful to get better prices from merchants who con
apprehensive. It also lets you trade with ones who might not trade
with you normally.  Sneak can also let you do quests with NPC's that
wouldn't let you near them.

It takes zero mana to hide so you can use that mana for your other
spells. If you hide sucessfully, it doesn't wear off so you are safe
from KOS mobs indefinitely.  You won't come back from the fridge to
read, "Your invisibility fades... KOS_mob_001 hits you for more HPs
than you have. PLEASE WAIT."   You can still be seen by see invis
mobs, so it's not 100% safe, just longer lasting.
