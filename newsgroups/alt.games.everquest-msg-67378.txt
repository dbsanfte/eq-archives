  Casters already can bind themselves [almost] anywhere.  Why should
they get a license to be "reckless" while the rest of the classes
don't?  On top of being able to bind in the same zone, they also can
zip out of harm's way in 4 seconds.  And even if you can get a bind in
the same zone, or a neighboring zone as the one you die in, it doesn't
necessarily mean the corpse retrieval is going to be as easy as pie...
it just means less tedious running and less waiting through zoning
time.
