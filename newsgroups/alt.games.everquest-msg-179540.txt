This whole discussion calls to mind all the whines I've seen over
the years that go something like "where's the dynamic content they
promised us?".  So now they're actually changing something about
the "world" and people start bitching about it <before> it even
goes live.  Not bitching about problems with the release, nor
uncorrected problems days/weeks after release, but bitching about
imagined problems that might maybe occur with release.  Of course,
once you start down the path of speculative whining you will never
ever lack for topics to whine about, so I suppose there's a certain
twisted security to be found there.
