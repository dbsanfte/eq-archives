So, I see they've fixed the bug that caused players with "certain video
cards" to get kicked from the game...

Logging in, all excited! Time to bring in all those exp I couldn't
yesterday! Off hours, too!!! :)

BUT, first movement I make... POP! Back on desktop! :( WOULD YOU BELIEVE
THIS?!?!

I'm running EQ with all available expansions on this machine :

AMD Athlon (Thunderbird) 1200 MHz
524 MB DDR Ram
Geforce2 PRO 64 MB Graphics
Soundblaster Live! Sound
CD/DVD-drive
CDR/CDRW-drive

Considering I do have the hardware necessary to run SoL well, I enabled all
textures... and basically everything else is running in highest possible
mode.
And I have NEVER had problems getting kicked before... I'm getting REALLY
frustrating, considering I have a lot of great plans for the upcoming
EQ-weekend. Looks like I'm gonna have to read a book.

Any suggestions?

Morten
