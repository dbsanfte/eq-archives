I agree with you there... The line between cleverness and immersion-
breaking is fine, but it can be walked. Take the Steven Brust "Taltos" 
series. Cracking fantasy by any and all standards, not really comedic, 
like most of Terry Pratchett's, and yet full of literary in-jokes. 
Keeping an eye for those does not break the immersion, but it adds to 
the experience.

I haven't come across it myself, but I seem to remember there was a Star 
Wars joke somewhere in Highold Keep, and I'm probably missing many 
others. As far as I'm concerned, this simply sets the tone for the game 
environment. EQ is no po-faced, serious fantasy in the David Gemmell 
mold, but somewhere between Steven Brust and Terry Pratchett. Therefore, 
a froglok character named "Xenopus" fits right in, whereas one called 
"Kkkkermmittt", does not.
