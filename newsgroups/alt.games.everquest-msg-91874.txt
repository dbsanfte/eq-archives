Only time i heard of someone getting an item back was a guildie monk 
that both used Fungi and Robe of the Whistling Fist (as in, have to move 
it back and forth every 9 seconds), and foraged at the same time, and 
suddently realised that he had a fishing grub in his slot where Robe of 
Whistling Fist was supposed to be.
He petitioned, but doubted that he would ever get it, so was already 
back at the Raster camp when they contacted him and gave it back to him.
Do i need to mention he was one happy ikky?
