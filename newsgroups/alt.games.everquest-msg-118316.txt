Why you guys sweating this moron? Ebayites quickly become pariahs on
their new server unless they were already established there with a
real character leveled honestly (or at least friends who have). This
guy won't be any different. He may get a few open raids under his belt
but he'll never see anything good.

And buying cobalt armor? What kind of newb would waste real money on
that if they were splurging?

As for all the "offers", claiming the support of the lurkers is the
oldest trick on usenet. Most likely he got nothing but email flames
and decided to run for cover.
