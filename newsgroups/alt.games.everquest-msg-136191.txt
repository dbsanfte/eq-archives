The performance gain of PC2700 (333MHz) is really not enough to justify the
cost over PC2100 (266MHz). In EQ, and other high-demand memory situations,
it's better (and cheaper) to have 1GB of PC2100 than 512MB of PC2700. Do
these memory numbering schemes make as little sense to you as they do to me?

SCSI-3 15,000 RPM RAID-0, nuff said :)
