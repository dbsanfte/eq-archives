I am all for the Need before Greed groups if and a big IF there are drops
for all group members. I was playing my Cleric in Lower GUK was invited into
a Frenzy group 3 warriors, monk and a ranger and me. Just before the Frenzy
or PH was about to spwan they lay we are playing Need before Greed loot
rules. I politely inform them I am here for the FBSS drop also they tell me
its a Need before Greed and I dont need it. So I told them good luck and
left the group I then get a tell why are you leaving. I tell them there is
nothing dropped in the Frenzy area for a Cleric good luck on finding one the
will fight for nothing.
