Thanks Martin, that's the kind of info I am looking for at this point.

The biggest problem for us re Trak and VS is that they are on a rotation,
and, us being an alliance of several guilds, are not "allowed" to do them,
unless we go in with only one of the guilds.  VS at least has a pickup slot,
Trak doesn't even have that.  The only alliance that has been allowed into
the rotations is one of Japanese guilds.  If it weren't for the issues it
would cause us with too many of the large guilds on the server, we would
just go ahead and do them anyway.

Guess I'll see if I can talk them into giving Velks a go.
