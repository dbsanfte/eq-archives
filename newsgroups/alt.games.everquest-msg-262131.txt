Ever since playing my first character, a rogue, 30 days after EQ was
released.
I cannot help but notice how classes that do not play a class under the nerf
gun or under the force of the vision....
are always ok with what happens to the "other" class.

Funny how when changes happen to "their" toons they scream the loudest..

I think if this "ok splat the other guy" attitude didn't exist things. like
alchemy and the unfinished classes would have fixed much faster.
