I just can't see spending $418 on ram alone, considering you
could have a local place build a system for that much.

For comparison, I just replaced my GF's machine with a 850mhz
celeron, 256MB of ram, GF2 400mx video card based machine, minus
the O/S, keyboard/mouse and monitor for $450.  I had them put
it together (I didn't have a lot of time available) and just had
to swap the network card over, and install Win 98 and apps.
