Actually, I don't believe he is likely to be more difficult than 
Kerafyrm.  Kerafyrm DTs a lot, this one only reduces hp by 4000 plus 
whatever reduction occurs due to Stamina decrease, and combat damage of 
course.  For a 14k+ hp tank, that is not that bad.  The trick would be 
keeping agro, depends on what, if anything cures this, and how often it 
is cast.  I'd suggest having more than one high hp tank ready.  Of 
course, I could be entirely mistaken too, but, the spell alone does not 
make him more difficult by any means.
