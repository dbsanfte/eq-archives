Well this stuff can be different on different servers, but I've never seen
CC used to mean anything but "crowd control". As in filling out a group: "We
have a tank and a healer, need a CCer next." Meaning a class that can
reliably mez mobs, most directly referring to an enchanter or a bard. A
druid can be considered a CCer too (using root instead of mez), but that
doesn't work very well in indoor places like LDoN dungeons. A couple other
classes can mez singles but its hazardous for them (e.g. necros get their
mez resisted a lot and die quick because the attempt generates high aggro).
Pet classes can practice "ghetto crowd control" which means having the pet
occupy a mob off to the side while the group finishes off a different mob,
but its not as effective as real CC.

The other form of CC is "pacy", or pacify, which is basically
advance-crowd-control: a paladin, cleric or enchanter pacifies a room full
of mobs and then somebody can pull one without the others coming along. But
of course if the pacify is resisted its high-aggro, which is often fatal for
a chanter or cleric. Paladins can survive that outcome better, naturally,
but their pacify spell isn't as strong as the casters', and I believe only
enchanters get an AOE pacify spell.
