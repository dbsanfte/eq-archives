I follow the Paladin forums pretty closely, and I haven't
seen that anyone knows the answers to those questions yet.
Sorry...

You can still do it the old fashioned way and kill the
Shin Lord frog for it in Upper Guk, though.  That used to
be a rite of passage for every Paladin before they added
the quest version.  But that would be quite risky for
a full group of 22's, upper 20's is a more appropriate
level for that raid.
