Unfortunately even younger players would have to suck it and carry on
as if nothing happened.  My personal record was 36 deaths in one day,
deleveled (binding next to a named spawn is one quick way to do this).
Since this was before the guild lobby, I had to get someone to track
my corpses and deal with the mob before pulling al of my corpses to a
safe spot.
