Can someone give me direction on the best place to solo for a 35 Human SK ?

 So far, Unrest yields nice pp and drops, but tis not enough. Overthere is
good exp, but loots are small. FM Giants can be good, but they tend to beat
the snot outta solo SKs.
 I have set my SK up to Solo as I have done most in my 35 levels. But I play
with extreme caution and hate getting killed. I have accomplished reaching
KOS status all over EQ.

 Any suggestions on a good place to solo would be appreciated :-)


Thanks
