Befallen....shiver. Even lower level dungeon with locked doors, pit traps
and necro mobs which are really nasty at that level. Heat blood and the
snare is 300 points of damage.

Mind you this is partly why they made low level versions of summon

component is 70pp or something? A whole bunch of money to an untwinked
character in the teens.
