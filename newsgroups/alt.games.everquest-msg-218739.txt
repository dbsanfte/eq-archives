No perhaps not, but they are very adept at taking complex systems, 
finding a weak point and sitting on it for 10 hours straight. (a la 
beating most sports games... master the technique of scoring and you'll 
never see a loss again... or fighting game... figure out which combo 
works... and a,b,ba+y,x+l,a until whatever it is dead, or fps... 
determine the AI attack pattern and then dodge left+ fire, dodge left+ 
fire to victory...

EQ has often struck me as par for the course for a game in the 
playstation generation. From the 'tradeskill guides' to the 'vast 
majority of the "combat tactics"... the average solution to a problem is 
rarely complex or variable or dynamic... just like the sports games... 
just keep dodging left and putting the ball in the lower right...your 
sure to score more often than not.

The solution was to make travel interesting... npcs that followed you 
out of guk and ambushed you on your way... pirates on the boats... it 
wasn't that travelling is inherently bad, its that travelling without 
anything more than the occasional thunderstorm to liven it up is.

Hell getting from Freeport to Qeynos in 99 without EQAtlas, and an 
escort at level one should have been worth a boat load of xp... just for 
making the trip.

The trouble was Verant hadn't gotten around to making the various bits 
interesting, the vision was good it simply lacked content. Few NPCs 
responded to much of anything you said... sensible things like...hey 
where can I buy arrows?? Answer: give me a couple gold and I'll tell 
you... for a couple pp I'll send my boy with you as a guide... and their 
was little in the way of interesting interactive content... like running 
into a funky (and worthwhile quest!!) that randomly generated for you on 
your trip with mobs and script based on your level and class...

But rather than fill this void of content Sony went the wrong way, and 
simply removed the various elements instead of trying to liven them up.

A pen & paper rpg where you have to move from city a to b would look 
like this if it were outlined by Verant (but unfinished), and then GMed 
by Sony.

Player A: oh my god, we've hired ourselves out to escort a caravan to 
make the trip, but I just realized it'll take 1 month to ride there... 
you can't seriously expect us to play out the trip?

GM: Hmmm... the book doesn't say anything... but I'm sure I could 
improvise something if you want. It not like I'd leave it completely 
uneventful...

Player A: rolls his eyes. I just want to make my level.

GM : Fine. A magic book is on a pillar to your left, if you read it you 
will teleport instantly to your destination. Odd that you didn't notice 
it earlier... happy now?

Player A: um.. so I guess I might as well forget about the whole caravan 
thing then eh? I was actually looking forward to a little mercenary 
work. And we would have passed near a crypt that was sort of interesting 
sounding.

GM: Yeah, your loss.

Group teleports.

Player A: Ugh... this city is huge... how will I ever find that merchant.

GM: Well... if it were me I'd start with the local bars... bartenders 
usually know people... ... aw fuck it... there is a glowing line of 
light leading to your left... for some reason you know it will take you 
right to the merchant.
