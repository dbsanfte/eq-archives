Can rogues wear plate, though?

If they can (I don't remember), then great. If not, go to 
Shadeweaver's Thicket and kill Lesser Shades. They (occasionally) 
drop black armour.

Of course, it's all No Rent stuff; to make it permanent, get a tailor 
to combine it with some tattered leather. AC 6 SV Magic +1 for most 
items. Not great, but not bad for a low-level char.
