Not to mention there is nothing unrealistic about having someone
sell items for you.  It seems very sensible to hire Trader NPC's
to sell things for you - and they get a commission.

This kind of activity has been happening since the dawn of human
civilization.  The fact that EQ forces *you* to sell *directly*
instead of allowing you to hire a Trader NPC is actually less
realistic.

Trader NPC's could be very much like Banker NPC's.

The Bazaar is unimmersive in the extreme and expensive in terms
of resource utilizations (on both sides - client computer and
SOE server) and non-optimal.  It was just a bad solution all
the way around - although admittedly better than no solution.
