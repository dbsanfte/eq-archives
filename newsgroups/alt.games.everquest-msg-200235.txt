Not really. The idea of an "immortal" god is a Judeo-Christian construct. 
In the Greek and Nordic (and I'm pretty sure Egyptian and Indian also) 
mythologies gods get killed all the time.

In a Norrathian context, Agnostic is not one who doesn't believe in gods (
because they aren't a matter of belief, but a fact), but rather one who 
refuses to worship them.
