Yep ... except the old cards do not do DX9 at all.

Unfortunately when you play games and you will always move on towards
games which can do better things for you .. look good .. work well and
create a little bit of a break from RL.  EQ is not your normal game ...
it has held me enthralled for almost 5 years.  Like others I am a
little disallusioned atm .. hell my latest character is a 55 Berserker,
have a look at how unfinished that class is.

In Australia we have a prayer used during Anzac Day ... the equivalent
of the US Veteran's Day I would think.   The prayer, in part says, "at
the going down of the sun, and in the morning we will remember them".
The sun is going down on non-DX9 cards such as the Nvidia 4 and 5
series.

And so would I .. but DX9 is with us now and it's games .. they are all
dead cards for the future.

Yep .. reminds me of the SOE implementation of DX9 in EQ o(

Unfortunately, for those owners of Nvidia cards in the 4 and 5 series,
some of the DX9 games are already with us.  Will the latest iterration
of the Nvidia card save them, maybe.  But not at $US500 and not when
they take up the PCI slot alongside AGP slot and not when people will
require 480-500 watt power supplies to run them.

Yes and I expect that when the new graphics engine comes out .. those
that want to stay with EQ will be rushing the shelves.
