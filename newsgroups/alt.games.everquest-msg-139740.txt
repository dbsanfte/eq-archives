Good point. I only kill file top posters when I point out their error and
they come back with "Fuck you I'll do what I want Net Cop."
Uh ok bye bye. If they fly off the handle like that on some trivial

in the future is not worth reading. Kind of like beating the bushes to see what
rats scurry out. Quite effective actually.
