I've given a quick look through this newsgroup regarding horses
and have a couple questions. First, a little background... I'm a druid
who likes to quad kite. So, I can already SoW myself. I've read that
the differnce in the horses price is determined by their speed (dah),
with the most expensive one's speed being equivalent to a high
level SoW (approx at least). Can I buy the cheapest horse (the only
one I can afford right now) and cast SoW on it/me? If I can, is there
any benefit I'd get from forking out another 90kpp for the more
expensive ones?

I've also read that we're medding while on a horse. Is this only
while stationary on a horse and not casting? Will the time I spend
circling my prey while quadding give me back the mana I used
to ensare them? Will the time I spend casting lightning also regen
mana at medding rate?

Most of the drawbacks to being on horseback seem to be related to
being up so high. Is this effect allieviated by turning off the graphic
for horses?
