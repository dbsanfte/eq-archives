Agreed on both of these.  I'd really like to see them start off with armour
having penalties (heavier, cumbersome, *conductive*) and have magic start
removing penalties before they head on to actually give bonuses.  Widens the
range of options, if nothing else.  And I'd love to see melee armour *never*
have clicky effects.  The occasional embedded effect, appropriate to the
item, yes, but no clicky ones.  And no proc ones, either.  Those should be
the province of, say, an Enchanter, to *enchant* your weapon.

As for the AI, wouldn't it be horrifyingly great to fight orcs who use the
*exact* same tactics that characters use?  They gangbang the cleric, then
severely discomfit the wizard, only after which they turn and hammer on the
warriors?  5 orcs versus group of 6, one orc peels off for each melee (to
keep him occupied), then *all* the remaining orcs stomp the nearest cleric
into the ground.

This actually isn't that bad a thing, and really can't be beaten.  The game
can't be *infinitely* flexible in regard to the quests, and thus the new
method of describing them on websites such as Allakhazam would simply list
all of the potential paths and their varying requirements.

Optimist.  The SWG codebase is supposedly fresh, and look how badly they
botched it with bugs being continually reintroduced and / or unstoppable.

Umm, disenchanted, perhaps?  Looking to take Dubya's place, are you?

Bated breath, not baited breath.  You don't have a mouthful of sardines.
(Well, maybe you do.)  Bated, from (a)bated.

There's a couple of things I'd like to see brought into EQ, maybe via EQ2,
from SWG.  They had some good ideas with their tradeskills; they just
royally screwed it up once the game got running.  Also, two things from the
interface.  In SWG, when you move the mouse against the left/right edges of
the screen, *you turn around*.  I find I miss that in EQ.  That, and being
able to use the mouse wheel to move my POV closer and further away.


Do you know what one thing I'd like to see introduced into EQ2 that isn't in
EQ1?  The one thing that would automatically make me switch from one to the
other?  Of course you don't.  But I'm gonna tell you anyway.

Factions that mean something.  Kill dwarven guards and you rapidly become
KOS to *all* similarly-aligned dwarves, including the merchants.  AND you
become KOS to Brell.  Suddenly it turns out that PC clerics of Brell, be
they Dwarves, Gnomes, Humans, whatever, are *unable* to heal / buff you.
Ideally, this would also mod such that their attempt to heal you would give
*them* a small negative faction with Brell.  (This requires a bunch of
interface changes that I wrote up in an article a couple of years ago.
Google for "Some ideas for EQ2, revision 1.0", Sept 1, 2000.)  Similarly,
you spend a bunch of time in LGuk whacking undead, and suddenly the Live Guk
shamans will occasionally cast SoW or some other buff on you as you wander
past.

Imagine being able to start a Dark Elf Cleric worshipping Innoruuk, deciding
you don't like him anymore, doing a bunch of actions that reduce your
Faction with Innoruuk while increasing it with Rodcet Nife, then going on a
quest to switch deities.  You too can roleplay an apostate, with proof
*in-game* that you've changed your evil ways!  Lashun Novashine *likes* you!
