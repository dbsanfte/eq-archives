There are to my knowledge only two things someone over level 52 can't do;
aggro Vox or Nafalgen.  You can still freely move around in Permafrost and Sol
B, you just can't get either of the dragons mad at you.

Luckily, Clerics don't need anything off either of these two, closest you'll
come is having to visit a vendor down in Naggy's lair; this can be tricky over
52 because he's often grabbed by people doing a Naggy raid, but its not really
that big a deal.

On the other hand, you might as well do parts now, most can be done out of
order, and many can be soloed or done by simple exp groups.

Lord Bergurgle.  Pain in the Tush rare spawn on a 16 minute timer down deep
underwater.  Do this with a druid if you can, since your PH is right next to
the PH's for one of the druid epic drops (ranger too perhaps?)  I ended up
soloing the camp at level 54 (for the pet) for 16 hours straight at one point
before getting it, I've helped others get it by having a tracking character
check on server repop and when passing thru.

Goblin in Sol A.  Another rare spawn on a PH deal, I soloed this one at 54 as
well... all green mobs and easier than the lord B camp.  Boooooring.

Plasmatic Priest.  One group kill in your 50s, need the first two parts to
trigger... but any triggered mob is easy to get people for, its camping for
endless hours that's hard on friendships.

Fire elemental in Burning Woods.  One group if high powered, usually a small
raid for ordinary 50somethings.  But it only takes about half an hour to set
up and do if you've timed it right (trigger mob only up half each EQ "day")

Noble in Chardok.  Bonafide raid target with some reasonably good drops for
50somethings, I've heard high powered people claim this is single group kill
too.

Now for the fun part: pearlescent fragments in Skyfire.  This is an exp camp,
the drops are rare off just about any mob in the zone, you can find nice
campable blues from level 40 to 60 to fit whatever force you have, from
soloing to full group, or even recruit multiple groups all killing at once if
you have a raid sized force for it.  This will almost certainly take days to
collect all four fragments you need (luckily, they are all identical, so none
of the "I have 1 2 and 3 and thats all thats dropping, I need part 4!"
nonsense)

Then you have one final triggerd mob to kill in Skyfire, which again is of the
"single group if you are uber, small raid if you aren't" level; and I defy you
to find a guild that won't go do this at the drop of a hat for any cleric in
their membership.  You might have trouble getting the boring parts done, but
tell them they can have another epic in the guild for half an hours work (and
maybe a COCW in the bargain) and they'd best drop what they are doing, or lose
a cleric quick.
