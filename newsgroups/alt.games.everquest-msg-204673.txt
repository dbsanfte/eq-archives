I can'y verify if this is true or not, but when I called their office, the 
San diego California number, and talked to the rep there he his that even 
though they say that they keep accounts for 3 months, they in fact NEVER 
erase characters or accounts. I personally find that hard to believe 
considering the space needed for that, but that was what I was told.
Hope it helps.
