So, I bought Luclin and loaded it Wednesday.  Very nice, but very slow 
graphically.  Time for a new graphics card methinks.

Bought Geforce 4 Mx440, 64Mb.  Installed it.

EQ doesn't work!  Patcher loads, does it's thing, then goes to play. 
Next up should be the licence, but it never gets there.  Screen goes 
black with just a egg timer cursor.  After a minute hit ctrl-alt-del to 
se 'Everquest [not responding]'.

Reloaded EQ (it's the freebie download), re-load Luclin.  No good.

Browse SOE, try the no-sound trick, try closing every running app, get 
latest drivers.  No good.  The only change has been the graphics card.

So, has anyone suffered this particular problem and/or does anyone have 
a solution?

I am running WinME, 1.3 Athlon (overclocked, but I have tried without 
too and anyway it all ran fine before).
