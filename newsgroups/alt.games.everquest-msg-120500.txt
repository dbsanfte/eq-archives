Look up a spell; see the description of what it does.  I'd guess
the only way to be "more specific" would be to make sure
you're looking at the "Detail" tab for the spell instead of the
History or Stacking...

Oh, and you need to actually click on the spell name if you
search for it by name and it pulls up more than one answer...
