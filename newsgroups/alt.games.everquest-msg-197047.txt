>When Verant created EQ, what did they have in mind ? 
My opinion is, judging from what I've seen in the game, EQ was
intended to be a lot of different things in order to attract a wide
variety of people, or to just allow you to play a totally different
game as the mood sways you.  Just look at the number of people who
really get into tradeskilling, or playing wheeler-dealer, or camping,
or doing dungeion crawls, or farming or raiding, or duoing, or
soloing, or questing, or dueling, or whatever.   Adding a certian type
of content does not preclude them  from adding different sorts of
content as well (nor does it prevent anyone from participating in
content that you or they might find more enjoyable.  Personally, I've
been having a blast with a newbie magician on the brand new Stromm
server.  I may not decide to play him to 30, much less 65, but for
now, it's fun to be a newbie again. 

Clearly someone thinks that the ultra high-end PoP content is worth
their time.  But just because they do, doesn't mean that everyone has
to.                                       -Haldur, 56 Cleric
