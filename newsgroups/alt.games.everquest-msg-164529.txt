More healing power for the druids, shamen, and clerics before they go OOM.
More CHes on raids, more manaburn power for wizards.  Druids can kite those
mobs that were just a wee bit out of the possible quadding range (well,
except for the greening nerf, but that hits melees as well).  Possibly the
only casters that don't benefit from a larger mana pool are necros.
