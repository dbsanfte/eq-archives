I've always noticed that noone ever fights the Orcs in SRo.  I've also
noticed that there seem to me more of a variance in the orc names.

With all the competition on Orc Highway, why don't more people hunt the Orcs
in S. Ro?  Seems like a good group could find 2 relatively close camps and
take them both, along with the wanderers.

If that's -not- what you do when you are spending your time there,
what -are- you doing?  A good Chanter quest ( besides the run to Ogguk )?

I loved camping the temple in Oasis, but it was sometimes hard getting a
group that didn't mind all the Adds - which are no problem with a good
chanter.  Best time I ever had in Oasis was myself, a cleric, and 4 meleers
at the Temple.  Great EXP and no lacking in Mobs.
