Anything of value that can be gained procedurally and automated rapidly 
with no input of rescources or capital ceases to have any value at all 
because supply is effectively limitless.

The only reason plat farmers can make any money is that they are a 
pretty small fringe subset of the player base. As soon as it became 
legitimate, accepted, and supported as a way to make a living (or 
supplant it). The number of people doing it would skyrocket and the 
value of anything gained in this manner would rapidly drop to near zero.

You neglected to mention that the game owners might not relish the 
thought of being used like this and might take any of several easy steps 
to interfere with it.
