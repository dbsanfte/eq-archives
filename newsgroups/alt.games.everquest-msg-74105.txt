You know, last week, I tried to get an exp rez for a groupmate. I
asked the only 56 cleric in Velk's, and instead of just saying no, she
said she didn't have the spell. We said the lower exp rez was fine,
and she promptly went /anon and claimed she was a paladin and could
only revive.
When a friend I was grouped with somehow managed to ask her nicely
enough for a rez for me the other night (60th pally; I was waiting for
him to rez and was surprised to be told that cleric would be rezzing
me), I made damned sure it really was Reviviscence before accepting.
