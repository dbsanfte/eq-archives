Nope, they won't. Your character sex is like your character race and
can't be changed after the fact (nor will they even change stats you
made mistakes with) Instead of worrying about roleplaying  a female or
thinking like a woman, just act like the character. Be the wood elf
druid or whatever and just don't say guy stuff like "OH I LOVE DREW
BARRYMORE'S BREATS!!!" or "WHAT DO U LOOK LIKE IN REEL LIF? R U REELY
A GURL?" Its not so much acting like a female as not acting like a
stupid male.
