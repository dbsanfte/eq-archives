So I have at my disposal a 57 druid PL.  We like to stick
to areas where there are drops she needs, currently that
means CC for small pieces of velium.

I've been twisting chains, warsong, hymn recently, and
swapping in a charm whenever a mob comes off me
and goes on her from her heals.  Just need to make sure
I tap every mob at least once in order to get the exp,
as the only damage she's putting in is DS on me and
maybe herself.  I also load Lullaby for those times when
the swarm on me seems to be overwhelming her healing
abilities, although thats not usually a problem as when
she heals me a couple times most of the swarm moves
to her.

Looking at my song list, though, I'm wondering if
there isn't a better plan.

How about twist Psalm of Warmth, Psalm of Cooling,
Hymn, with an occaisional hit of Chords of Dissonance
to make sure I've done damage to everything.  This would
raise the DS level from its current 24 to a whopping ....oops
just looked and psalms don't stack.  Too bad, an extra
11 points would have been nice.  Well still cooling will
be an extra 5 points, and I'll Keep Chords up, maybe just
leave strings on full time and raise the hymn/chords combo
output.  I'm thinking that with the DS swarm on me plan
this would result in more dead mobs faster, rather than
worrying about my slow/haste weapon output which
only really affects a single mob at a time.

I will say that Hymn plus chloro plus SLN makes for a lot
of HP regeneration, if the swarm on me isn't large my
druid friend doesn't have to heal me at all!
