My Monkish intimidate experience:
1. you could get skillups on anything. I probably got half my skillups
intimidating the boat. You can also get skillups at any range from the
target.
2. The 'old way' which I understand is changed slightly, in order for you to
get a success the following conditions must be met:
    a. The target must be in front of you when the intimidate 'fires' (at
the end of the wonky animation).
    b. The target must be in melee range.
    c. Your special attack must be available, because the actual intimidate
uses the 'kick' attack to deliver paltry damage and trigger the fleeing.
    d. If your target requires magic weapons to damage, you must be wearing
magic booties, otherwise the kick won't land and the fear won't work.
    e. The damage you dealt with the successful intimidate was directly
influenced by your kick skill.
    I understand c and perhaps d have been changed...
3. skillups were glacially slow. Using it quite constantly, I would be
pleased with 3-4 skillups a night.

It is my understanding that c and perhaps d have been changed.
