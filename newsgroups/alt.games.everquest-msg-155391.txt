My enchanter is female.  I made her strictly to buy Mithril at the best
prices for my ranger who is practicing fletching.  I started playing her to
get her up high enough to make some of the various mana vials that my main
would be needing for tailoring, and just had a blast, so, she quickly became
my most played alt.  I had several things given to her out of the blue by
male characters.  I have been harassed a few times, nothing too serious.  I
have also had one or two female characters harass my main, but that is
admittedly much rarer than the other way around.
