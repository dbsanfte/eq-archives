ALWAYS?  If always, delete the GD zone files.

Velious has always sucked when it comes to zoning, but I don't ALWAYS crash
when going into GD...only ever 2-3 times. :p  Playing my druid, if folks
need a ride to different places I always hold any Velious zone to be last
because chances are the group will be bugged when reaching there.

It would be nice for Verant to put Velious on the front burners to get
zoning issues FIXED but I doubt if it'll ever happen.
