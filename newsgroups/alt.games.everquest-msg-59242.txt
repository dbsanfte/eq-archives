It's not a wild example.
Infact, I perfer having shamans in my group instead of
enchanters/clerics.

The provide both slow and sufficient haste along with healing
abilities.  

I generally level FASTER in these situations since I don't have to add
"dead-weight" classes to the group siphoning up exp.

It's only when you start doing harder hitting mobs that you need to
worry about crowd control.  Against spiders, it's a joke.  I can solo
those spiders, it's just very high downtime afterwards.
