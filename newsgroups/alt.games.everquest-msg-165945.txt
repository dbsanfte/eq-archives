You can use the software you already have installed on your system to
open the second account.  Or you could take your CDs and install the
software on another system and use the code to open the second account.
Or you could do both, for that matter.  The code is good for the whole
trilogy, so you do not need to buy the trilogy software, and the only
reason to buy the Luclin and PoP software is because that's the only
way I know of to get an account code.  So, the part that is not true
is: "you would still need to go and buy all the software all over",
you don't need to buy all the software, only the expansions that you
still need codes for.

You presumably already possess all the software.  You can install it on
any number of computers, but you cannot access an account from more than
one computer at any given time.


Clear now?
