Once again, it's a matter of business ethics. What you CAN charge
isn't necessarily what you SHOULD charge. If such a simple moral
concept is beyond your ability to grasp, I'm wasting my time trying to
explain it to you.

Its perfectly relevant. What's irrelevant is whether or not it has a
"season". Predictions of a storm will raise demand and supply may not
be able to keep up with it. That doesn't make it right or legal to
raise the price.

Buyers and sellers. Not seller, seller****S****. One seller ramping up
the price on something doesn't make that price the new market value.

No, it doesn't have to do with right or wrong, but it does have a lot
to do with being a smart businessman or a stupid one.
