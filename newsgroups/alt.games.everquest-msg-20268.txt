Use Levitate in that zone.  There's a place near the hand room with a
false floor.  I've seen people take 10k damage for falling there (it
should only do a couple hundred, but there's a bug that sometimes
causes 10k, and since there is a falling trap there, GMs won't res
you).

Also, watch out near the zone.  There's a mix of undead and dead
there.

Also watch out of the bats.  Those things see through all forms of
invis (including rogue hide/sneak).
