I did a Hard *collect 22* remains today with my 52 cleric.  Rest of group was
54 - 57 warrior, shaman, necro, bard, chanter.  Everything was white/red to me.
 I had KEI and was never below 40 mana.  Had one death, the chanter after a
mispull that made all of us run to the zone.  Completed quest with 5 minutes
left :)
