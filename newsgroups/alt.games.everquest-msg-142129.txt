Oh yeah, like that's going to be a problem.  Your XP group gets wiped out by
RF.  You do "/who all cleric 60", and start sending tells "Hey!  Ragefire is
up and no one is trying to kill it!" and the problem will soon be taken care
of, and you can probably even get your XP group resed by one of the happy
clerics you sent a tell to.
