It is an old bug that seems to be in the world server and may involve its
interaction with your ATI card.  I ran into it last year and found a simple
work around.  Create a new character, go to it and the return to the
character you want to log in and enter the game.  It should then let you
log, but when you leave you will have to delete the new character you made
and create another one to enter.  This is the only solution I found short of
buying a new card, for Verant apparently is not willing to acknowledge this
problem.
