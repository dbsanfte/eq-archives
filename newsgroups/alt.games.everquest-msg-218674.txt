Not at all...suppose you've got crutches and a cast, and the doctor 
never said don't move around. But crutches don't make up for a 
deadweight leg, and your balance will be reduced.

Perhaps. The courts may decide otherwise. I'm merely stipulating its not 
an open and closed case. MS for example, as I just said in other post, 
is covering its ass re: pedophiles in chatrooms... another unmoderated 
social situation.

On the face of it: No. But it could be quite a bit more complicated than 
that. Grade school (k-12) can be a pretty nasty environment; there is 
nothing like it in the 'real world'. I wouldn't jump up and blame the 
school... but I wouldn't dismiss the allegation as absurd without 
following up on it either.

And lately with some of the high profile bullying related suicides and 
murders for example, the public is scrutinizing the culpability and 
responsibility of the schools for fostering an environment that leads to 
unbearable conditions for some of its students.
