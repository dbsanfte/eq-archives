hes a fucking shitfest of an encounter

I remember a recent popping... he was due that day, and 2 "uber" guilds were
trying for the camp..  for 2 days straight, 90+ people sat in the nearby
vacinity of rage (it got to 110 at 1 point)

It would have been amusing to see the after events, had he popped before GM
intervention...
