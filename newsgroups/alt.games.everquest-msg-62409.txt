Well with your clean web pages you probably don't have much of an issue
compared to a site full of graphics (and that's a compliment! <g>).  The
biggest difference between downloading 50 maps at once or a single map a
day for 50 days is the load balance aspect.  Most hosts base usage over
a given period, so if you pulled down one map a day for 50 days the
usage on a daily or weekly report would only reflect that amount of DLs,
but if you grabbed them all at once (really becomes an issue if
multiplied by numerous users doing the same thing, for a single action
of this sort to be an issue you'd need a pretty crappy host.) short term
reports reflect major usage.  

Over the long term assuming you never go back for updated maps grabbing
them all may result in less actual usage of the site, but the short term
picture may cost the site their host.  Clearly its a matter of personal
choice as to how a person feels on this, but I come from the old "eat
what you take" school and so only pull a map I need today (pretty rare
occurance actually) rather than grabbing them all in case I get "hungry"
later.
