IIRC, they said they corrected the attribution of hate/agro from DS.
Nothing was mentioned about attribution of damage for purposes of
crediting kills.

/speculate
Perhaps they discovered that the occasional poofing of a high-level mob
corpse was related to the hack job they applied to the code in order to
prevent PLing via pure DS (i.e. the requirement that the mob be damaged
at least once by other means or it poofs with no xp and no loot), and
figured since thousands of folks were PLing like mad anyway they might
as well just drop it and cut down on the complaints from the raiding
crowd.
