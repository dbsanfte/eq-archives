> Underwear?  What's this underwear thing you speak of?

Underwear is what you run around in on a CR. I have had people inspect my
underwear before, it just happens to look like a tunic and pants with no
graphic in inventory.  Then I get the "Oh, your on a CR..."

I have always wanted to give feedback to Verant to ask How come my male HEF
cannnot run around in a loin cloth damnit! I look dressed even when I am
nekkid.
