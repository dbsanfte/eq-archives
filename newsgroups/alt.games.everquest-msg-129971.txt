Your best bet is to ask some high level friends for anything they might have laying
around.   Or see if you can buy a decent weapon from another player,
like a frozen long sword for about 30pp or a velium long sword for about 10-15pp,
depending on how much plat you have at the moment.  Both of those weapons
won't drop off of mobs you can't kill till you're at least level 33 or so, but they aren't
terribly expensive because the vendors won't pay more than about 6 plat for velium
weapons and maybe 15pp for the frozen long sword.
