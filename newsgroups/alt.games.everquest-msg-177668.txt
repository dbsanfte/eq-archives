No, you only need the expansions to exist, and another player willing
to sell/trade you the items you want from the expansions. Yes, this is
more difficult, but it does not change the fact that you can get the
items without buying the expansion. It is as simple as that. Why you
refuse to admit such a simple truth is beyond me.

Goody for you. That still doesn't change the fact that you are wrong
about all new content requiring the purchase on an expansion.
