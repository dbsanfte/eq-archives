Actually neriak/nek forest is what i was basing myself on . 
I started up a DE necro having never played in these zones, i've passed through
often enough but never actually levelled up in them. I still managed to hit 8
in 6 hrs no twinking nothing and even then i spent an hour cleaning up some
57lvl's kills at the back of neriak. (and 5 hrs for 8 lvls is considered by
some now to be slow)

If you know what your doing its a hell of a lot easier to lvl than if you're
truly new, but the key is if you *know*.

You already know your way around nek forest - it hasn't changed that much but
now you've filed the loc's of that camp away you're not going to be wandering
near it again - how many newbies would make that mistake more than once until
they got the hang of it?

Not having to worry about cr and xp loses is certainly going to help them learn
their way around faster but it's still going to take time.

And yes neriak is definately a royal bitch to get around, especially when you
forget to print a map of the 3rd quarter :( (something else a newbie isn't
going to know to do)

I don't care what is written about me so long as it isn't true.
