There is a formula for the max damage you'll do that includes STR - but
that isn't as useful as the modal damage (IIRC my terms correctly -
been a LONG time since stats).

The number to look at for your main hand is

(2xDam)+Dam_bonus

To get your damage bonus - go here:

Based on your skill level I'd say you're under 28th, so your bonus is 1
on your main hand (off hand doesn't get a bonus).

(10x2) + 1 = 21

This is right in line with the numbers you're reporting.

I'm sure one of the long time melee here can give you a more thorough
run down.
