In your opinion. Perhaps, to the person phrasing the request it is the
exact equivalent of "please".

Why doesn't that equally apply to acronyms such as "SoW"?

Sounds good, and is pretty close to something I'd say.

You're comparing apples and oranges... try comparing your original
example with....

"Pardon me good Shaman/Druid/Ranger, but would you plz take a moment
to imbue me with a wolf spirit?"

Why disregard every other indicator that they are being polite just
because they said "plz" rather than "please"?

Perhaps we will need to agree to disagree. Now for a question I will
be posing to others in this thread:-

A hypothetical situation; you were fighting in Dreadlands as a level
45 (hell level) when the group was over-confident / unlucky and
managed to get wiped out. The first on the scene has a cleric friend
nearby who is level 49 and willing to help. After a few minutes, when
the cleric gets around to you, you get the following /tell....

"Are u rdy 4 a rez?"

What is your reply, and why?
