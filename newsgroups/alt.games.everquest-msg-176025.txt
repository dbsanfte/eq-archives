ZEM matters a lot.  They nerfed red-con xp a long long time ago.  As
far as I can tell you get no more xp for a red than a yellow, and the
limit appears to be applied before the ZEM (i.e. you get more xp for
killing a yellow con in, say, Paludal than in OT).

A Druid's most powerful PLing tool is his DS used in combination with
his Skin buffs and heals, plus Root/Snare for mobs that run on low
health.  All of these which work in any zone (well, Root/Snare don't
work on all mobs, can't think of any of these that are PL targets tho).

Red doesn't matter, yellows die faster for same xp.  ZEM does matter.

For PLing, except for the few outdoors dungeons (all "dungeons" have
better ZEM than regular outdoors zones) the Druid's preference for
being outdoors means very little, certainly less important than the
ZEM and the availability of mobs to kill.

Also, if offensive melee skills matter at all to the PLee, you don't
want to fight reds at all because you need to score hits to get
skill-ups with weapons.  Offense will go up when you are hit if you've
got a DS, so it's only the weapon skills themselves you need hittable
targets for, so a caster that only cared about one weapon (Shaman and
Piercing or Cleric and 1H Blunt) could get by without worrying about
this (buy weapon skill at NPC trainer).  But any melee has multiple
weapon skills to raise (plus H2H for Monk/BL) and they need to hit
mobs to get those skill-ups.  Melee would get best results from mowing
through a huge number of high-blues using fast good ratio weapons,
a haste item, a clicky ATK buff (Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring), and
no need ever to rest or wait for spawns (i.e. go somewhere with a
near-endless supply of mobs and buff/ds/heal, breaking only to train
new melee skills or move to a new spot when necessary).
