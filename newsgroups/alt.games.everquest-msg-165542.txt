I said "I would suggest learning piercing as well, especially as the best
budget weapon available for under 20's is a piercer, the Centi War Spear" I
didn't say he had to use it to learn the skill but I'd love to know how you
managed to learn 2hs with that logic, find many with sub 30 delay did you?

Anyway, given this choice

3/19 piercer
or
20/30 (2h)piercer +5AC +5str +5sta

What would you take?

Oh, BTW, OP is level 3...10 more levels until that second FS Dagger comes
into play
