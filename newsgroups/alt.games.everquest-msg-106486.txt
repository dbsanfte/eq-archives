I am saying that the weapon ID shows a damage bonus of 5 because you
are holding it.  Give the same weapon to a character significantly
higher or lower level than you, and the bonus will be different.  I am
saying that there is no weapon bonus, but there is a damage bonus
applied to all primary-hand weapons based on the weilders level.  (And
at low enough level the bonus is 0 and not displayed.)
