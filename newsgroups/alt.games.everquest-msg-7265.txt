Wow. Since when was this about taking "sides"? Just how immature can
you get, Dan?

In as condescending a way as you are able to muster.

He didn't call you a fucking moron. That was Avenguh, who
imaginatively caught the habit from Bizbee. Perhaps what he had
"gathered" was that you do NOT speak for the EQ community. You don't
even speak for the a.g.e community.

You speak for yourself. As do we all. Get used to the idea.

Ah, another spectacular display of Dan's narrow-minded thinking. Never
shy to resort to stereotypes, are you Dan?

Everyone who uses MiXeD CaPiTaLiSaTiOn is a "d00d", and anyone who
disagrees with you is a quake player. I rather suspect that your
dislike for Quake stems from your piss-poor Quake-abilities. Was it a
bit too fast-paced for you, Dan? Your reactions a little slow these
days? I enjoy Quake *and* EQ... but then again, they are very
different. Perhaps some people aren't able to adapt to multiple
play-styles?

>> Good luck getting answers to your future questions.

<shaking head>

cOrPoRaL kLeGg, for what it is worth I think your name blows... but
that is just my opinion. I won't try and insist that my opinion should
in any way-shape-or-form dictate what your actions should be (i.e.
change your name). That is up to you.

Ignore Dan. He is just a poor sap with a very low self-esteem who
finds comfort by jumping on any and all opportunities to show how much
"better" he is than others. Sadly, about the only subject he feels
superior in is the *polite* expression of the English language.

So if you dare to say "plz" you are instantly labelled a rude,
thoughtless, powergaming dood.

Welcome to alt.games.everquest... Welcome to the home of the
analy-suppressed.
