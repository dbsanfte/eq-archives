Assuming you mean making one social invoke another, as in:
	/say blah
	/cast 3
	/say more blah
	/dohotkey 7
or something like that, I don't know of any way to do that.  I suspect
it would make it too easy to set up "bots".  If there really is a way
to do it, I'd love to hear it.

What you *can* do is set up your UI so that a single keystroke performs
two actions.  Go into your Options >> Keys window and specify the same
key for two different actions.  (Classic uses for this are things like
making your left-arrow key also do Sense Heading or some other skill
you were trying to train up.)  For example, I have ctrl-X bound to the
/camp action, but I also have it bound to Hotbar 2 key 3, which is where
I keep a social that writes my inventory and spellbook into files in the
same directory as my log files.  Typing ctrl-X thus does both things.

It probably doesn't work to invoke two socials this way, because you
can't use any hotkeys while another hotkey is already doing its thing.
But things like /camp + social, or /attack + social, where one of the
actions has its own entry in the Options >> Keys window, work okay.
