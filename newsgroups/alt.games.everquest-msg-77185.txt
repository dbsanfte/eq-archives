    Something I've been throwing around in my head is the idea of a "gimp
link" in a heal chain - instead of a CHealing cleric, have the druids,
shamans, and paladins all throw something SHeal-sized on the main tank at
once, assuming you have enough of those classes present to make the
collective heal the same as a CHeal (with one or two extras to allow for
late heals and linkdeath). Do you think something like that would be
workable? It might not be to the tastes of a finely-tuned top guild with
minimal numbers at raids, but I know a few guilds with more than enough
people at raids to at least create a gimp link.
