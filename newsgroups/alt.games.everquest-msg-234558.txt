Actually i think thats wrong.
I remember the "dont double hail!!" warnings (both hearing and telling them
as an officer) when we were flagging up, but I also recall a fix, to stop
non-flag hails from using up one of the flags (extra hails don't generate
any kindof NPC response.. so they can tell if u are flagged or not)

You know, PB AE stuns work great here =)  Much easier to control spiders
with stuns than trying to mez a whole whorde of never ending adds.
