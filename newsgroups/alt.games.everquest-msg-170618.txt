I'm a bit tired of visiting my bind point in places like BoT where 2
mobs coming to play don't like my healing.  Generally I can manage
after a prayer to Tunare for my safety, but sometimes an add comes
lumbering unnoticed just as my heal lands.  Channeling DA (and dealing
with the "spell recast time not met" frustration) is a miracle.  

So, I'm wondering if the CA and LR skills would be valuable to a
cleric or just a waste of AA (I  have 40 aa so far).  I would love to
hear from clerics or even other priests/casters that have put points
into these.   Mobs hit so hard, I'm uncertain whether a 10-20%
increase in avoidance would matter.
