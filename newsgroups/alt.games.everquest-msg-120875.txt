Not to say the whole history of it is obvious, but the germanic connection.

Dutch - mid-14c., used first of Germans, after c.1600 of Hollanders, from
M.Du. duutsch, from O.H.G. duit-isc, corresponding to O.E. �eodisc
"belonging to the people," used especially of the common language of
Germanic people, from �eod "people, race, nation," from P.Gmc. *theudo (see
Teutonic). As a language name, first recorded as L. theodice, 786 C.E. in
correspondence between Charlemagne's court and the Pope, in reference to a
synodical conference in Mercia; thus it refers to Old English. First
reference to the German language (as opposed to a Germanic one) is two years
later. The M.E. sense survives in Pennsylvania Dutch, who came from Germany.
Since 1608, Dutch has been "an epithet of inferiority" -- Dutch treat (1887)
, Dutch uncle (1838), etc. -- probably exceeded in such usage only by Indian
and Irish. Dutch elm disease (1927) so called because it was first
discovered in Holland (caused by fungus Ceratocystis ulmi).
