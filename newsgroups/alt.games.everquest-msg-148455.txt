Daoc's only selling point is the PvP..or RvR combat. I played a lvl 47 Thane
(this was like 5 months ago i guess). On day where I could actully find a group
and people to kill in battle grounds..it was fun...but if theres no friendlies
to group with..and your a non sealth unit..your screwed forgetaboutit. And I
agree with the lvling system...its shiet. I never liked any tradeskill EQ or
Daoc so not a clue there....Also the buying/selling market is shit..theres no
rewards in the game IMO no uber loot worth 500,000pp..cause really...noone
buys/sells in the game gold (plat) is worthless only needed to repair armor and
such no really need for it other then tradeskills...I was disapointed with Daoc
and cam crawling back to EQ happily I might add !!
