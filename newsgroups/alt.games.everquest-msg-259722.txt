I'd say back when it was new, it was incredible.  But these days, it's 
worth about 5AA, and not 9, IMO.  The DC pets available in PoP zones are 
not so much better than your highest summoned pet as to make it that 
worthwhile.  DC pets are also subject to being dispelled, which is rarely 
a problem, but a problem nonetheless.

Don't get me wrong, it's still a good AA.  But it's just a fun toy.  I 
wouldn't rate it as a -huge- priority.  All those other ones listed two 
posts ago were clearly more important.  Well, except maybe buff extension.  
People just don't live long enough to make 70% extended buffs all that 
worthwhile, when all your buffs are group buffs, and only one person dying 
in a group is enough to necessitate a recast.

In the fairly likely circumstance that DC ends up being a prerequisite for 
the Advanced DC coming in OoW, though, its value may go straight back up.
