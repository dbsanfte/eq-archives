>The only reason to want a 55+ mage is CoH.

>>CotH, Mod Rods, damage shields. Again, not a great role, but better
than
the one you presented. 

Necros are better mana pumps, druids provide decent damage shields.

This thread is about nerfing and mages as a class have been terribly
nerfed post 50.  When the level cap was 50, mages grew increasingly
powerful with level.  They were one of, if not the greatest, damage
dealers in the game.

Now imagine how a damage dealer feels when suddenly relegated to a
utility role.  I would love to see what would happen if Verant shifted
the 50+ warrior's role to mod rodding.
