One of the effects of offline trading is currently it's a buyer's market. I
saw adepts for sale at 8 silver today. To create a slightly better item as a
scholar, i'd need to find silver or coral (hasn't happened once) or i could
buy one for about 14 gold.

Maybe at the upper levels it's better (I'm 17 both) but so far I can really
see the temptation of botting. As things stand, the crafting is repitious,
sometimes the system doesn't 'get' that i've pressed a response (latency?
I'm in australia) and the qeynos trade house layout is just annoying.

Adventuring has gotten better i think although I'm disappointed the "toning
down" didn't happen (as far as i know). Oh well, maybe next patch.
