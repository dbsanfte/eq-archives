This impression comes purely from the customers, not the players.
Nothing they do is designed to imply that the game can't be played
without them. Also, this is nothing new for SOE at the helm. (Luclin
was Verant's last expansion, by the way) Finally, the pace of
expansions is pretty much the same as before.

Ethical? Yes. Annoying? Again, yes. But annoying != unethical.

Neither is any other MMOG, really. The mere fact that it's an online
game makes having the expansion to play with others more necessary.
This isn't unique to EQ by a long shot.

Problem is, it's not YOU who makes the final decision on what should
and should not be free. The game plays fine without the features
expansions added. I see no harm for charging extra for conveniences.

Find another one yourself. The comparison is absolutely absurd,
starting with the fact that SOE's business practices are totally legal
and harmless, unlike a drug dealer's.

Yes, yes, but consider also production, marketing, distribution, etc
costs. SOE doesn't make ~$20 **PROFIT** off each expansion. Take a few
business courses before making such stupid remarks.

Yes, it's motivation to continue putting them out. To this, I say
"FANTASTIC!" The more content they keep adding, the better for us.
