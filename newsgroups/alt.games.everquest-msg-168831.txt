}please, save us both the time.

Sorry?  What time are you trying to save?  Your posts would make much more 
sense if you'd quote the preceding post.  It has expired off my server, so 
personally, I have no clue what you're talking about.

There's an RFC thingy somewhere that specifies that one should quote 
above your message just as much as necessary of a post you are replying to 
to make your post understood.  Give it a try.  It won't bite.
