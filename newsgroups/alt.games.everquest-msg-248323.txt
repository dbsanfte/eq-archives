Someone forgot to tell players of Star Wars Galaxies! On the server that my
guild chose to start on, you could not log in the entire first day and a
half of launch except for a couple of hours at the beginning of launch day.
However, unlike any previous commercial MMMOG that I've ever known of or
played, SWG made the decision to wipe all characters from the production,
post-release servers, requiring all paying customers to start over. And this
we couldn't do for a day and a half. After that day and a half, the bugs
were legion. Factories broke and did not work at all for days at a time,
crashes to desktop were common and predictable at certain locations, and
content did not work. Theme Parks were completely broken, and faction HQ
could not be destroyed by rivals. Everything you describe and more. Yet this
server filled with players who got hooked by the action and invested in
their characters. Sales continue to be brisk.

But I understand your point. If all of the above happened AND there was a
compelling alternative, then the chances are good that a lot of those
players of SWG would have flocked to the alternative. And that's exactly
what's different about this upcoming scenario. This time if something
similar happens, there will be that opportunity. I bet this factored into
Sony's thinking when it came time to decide on a release date for SWG.

That's exactly why I used the word "intention". My point is that it's my
"intention" and "desire" to try both, they both look very appealing to me.
But I know that once I get hooked into one and start investing in that
character, I'm not likely to want to go start over with a new game. If I get
enough of what I want from the first one on the market, I probably won't
even try the 2nd one to hit market, even though I'm highly interested right
now. If I had a clear preference of one over the other now, as you do, it
might be different, maybe I'd wait or play the first more "tentatively", but
given the huge difference between the pre-game buzz and the release reality,
I don't see how I could have that preference right now. Both look very
promising to me and if the first one that comes to market delivers the
goods, the 2nd one just isn't going to get a fair hearing from me because
I'll be too busy enjoying the first.

The thing is, there hasn't ever been this kind of situation before, where
two world-class MMOG blockbusters-in-the-making are headed for what appears
to be a simultaneous launch release. I think this is going to put some
extraordinary pressures on both companies and I predict that SOE will yield
to this pressure and release first (whether ready or not) and Blizzard will
do what Blizzard has done in the past, wait till they believe they're ready.
