Is this a rhetorical question?
EQ Is great don't get me wrong , I just recently took a break in order to do regular things like sleep , eat ETC.. lol
Prefferably I would like to play both  EQ2 and SWG when they come out but if it came right down to it .....well 
let's put it this way : For about 25 years now , how many people in the world do you think have been waiting 
for this chance to actually immerse yourself in the star wars universe? This is as close as it's gonna get for some 
time to actually becoming a jedi , sith lord , Tuskan raider etc. whatever your preffered character of choice would 
be , finally we get the chance to live this fantasy.
     People were so stunned (and rightly so) to see subscription numbers towards a 1/2 million people on Everquest.
Here's a prediction .... prepare to be stunned all over again .Cause the Star Wars Galaxy is coming to a PC near 
you very soon!!
