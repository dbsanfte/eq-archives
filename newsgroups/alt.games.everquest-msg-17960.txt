I was in Befallen waiting for Gynok, with the same old skeletons and rats,
when there was a white-text "thunderous undead army waking up"-type message,
and the next thing I know two Dark Followers had appeared in the spawn
points in the open bit by the zone (a rogue and a necro). Apart from the
surprise, they didn't do me much pain (L37) but shortly after the other two
people in the zone said there were more of them where they were. I spent two
hours in the place, with 30 or 40 others.

Point being, there was Old Befallen, then there was New Befallen. Maybe
Drinal will get its event switchover soon. I take it the two Dark Elf camps
in WC have appeared though?
