For the greater edification of usenet (:P), I'll answer that.  Most women,
and many men, lack the capacity to tell someone to "get lost".  
Especially the nice ones.  Telling someone to "just tell me to get lost if
you want me to!" will not work.  Because if they were capable of it they
would have said so already.
