EQ won't be phased out, Verant is making too much money from it. Although
they can discontinue their services at any time for any reason, if they just
shut it off on me I wouldn't subscribe to their new game. Also, I think that
quite a few other people would agree.

Don't be fooled, EQ2 isn't just going to be EQ with a new graphics engine
(and not the thing that came with Luclin), it's going to be an entirely new
game with new rules, new classes, new advancement and many many other new
things.  Things that from what I've read, are ripped from Dark Age of
Camelot. Things that I didn't like in that game (and lead me to quit after
only three weeks playing) and that give me just cause to NOT want to make
the move to EQ2. Snazzy graphics certainly help, but if the gameplay sucks
then it's not worth it.

I love EQ. The way it's structured, the way it plays, the races, the
classes, the layouts, the systems (even with all the flaws most of which I
don't notice).
