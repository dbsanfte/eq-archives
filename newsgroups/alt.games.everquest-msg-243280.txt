Why not let plat sellers sell their plat or equip/char sellers sell their 
equip/char. Somehow it is only fair for them if they want to make some 
profit of the time they invested in the product that they sell.

No one forces anyone to buy from them, so if they dont like the idea, they 
can just stay away.

You hate people who work for money?
