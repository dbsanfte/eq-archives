No, the little high elf (musta been) was being an idiot.

It's true that my level 53 enchanter (54 this week!) does sorta EXPECT
someone to SoW me if I'm casting clarity around, but if I don't get it
automatically I politely ask for one.  Since I also have a druid (51, 52
this week!) I know that a lot of them will say, "oh, right, sorry" and cast
it right away.

BTW, don't do this /ooc trading sow for clarity at <location>.   Most
enchanters I know have ZERO problem getting people to come to THEM to
deliver SoW.  Besides which, SoW?  Big deal.  Sure, give me SoW, but toss in
a Skin too...SoW casters are a dime a dozen.

Unless it's a friend (and even then it depends on if I'm busy) or someone
paying an insane amount of cash (100p or more) I NEVER deliver clarity.  I
play a gnome.  I play an enchanter.  Gnome enchanters are the SERIOUS and
best enchanters and DAMN we have the attitude that goes along with it. :)
