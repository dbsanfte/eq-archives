Eh. Uber in EQ means stuff above your level.  Uber in DAOC means yellow-con,
just like at level 1.

Upgrades, upgrades and more upgrades.  I'm amazed more people don't see that
as boring.

Not "for example," because except for a VERY few exceptions, every time you
get a spell in DAOC it IS an upgrade.  Again, boring.

I believe it gets up to 33% mana savings, but I could easily be wrong.  I
don't play a melee above 20 (not including my 27 bard...he's not melee) so I
can't say much about them.  I think they get disciplines starting at 40 now,
right?  But yeah, not nearly as much to look forward to if you're manaless.

Update, canceling DAOC tonight.  Why play EQ-lite when I can play EQ?  My
best friend is still playing DAOC some, but she's getting bored too.
