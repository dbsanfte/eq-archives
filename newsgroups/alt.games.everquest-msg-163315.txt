As a cleric, I can assure you I'd never ever mistake one for the other, and if
there's one spell I'd give half my gear for it would be snare.

Snare stops runners, snare makes fear kite possible, snare gives you time
between mob in range and mob beating on you... snare is simply fantastic.

Root holds a mob in place, where it will beat on whatever its near, cast on
whatever isn't, and break root as soon as it feels the timing is most annoying,
further nuking will break root about 3 times in 4.

Root is also a nice line, don't get me wrong, but its no snare.
