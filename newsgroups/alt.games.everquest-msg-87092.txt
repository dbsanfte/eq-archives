If you have Luclin try Marus Seru.  At 30 everything should be nice and blue
for soloing.  Everything is social to like kinded creatures and there are
only 2 kinds of creatures that I saw that are agressive while you med up.
And those 2 creeatures should be a piece of cake.  I let my pet take them
out if one jumped me.  Only down side to this is almost nonexistant loot.
That's why I only stayed until I got safely out of 30 so I wouldn't lose a
level after a couple deaths.  Now all I have to say is (In my best Homer
voice) Mmmmmm  Fear kiting Cynthia....(insert more Homer drool here)
