I use this technique too, but the layout of the place often means
that the vendor is on one side or the other of one of the medians
between stalls, and I have to run around that row several times
if its crowded, looking for the guy... I can get roughly to him
but then its hunt and peck.  Not impossible by any means, but I
should try the new way, see if its better.
