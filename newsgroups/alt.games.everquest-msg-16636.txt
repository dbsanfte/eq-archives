Just been reading a website about playing evil characters and found some
interesting posts about 'role playing' thought id share them here (stop
groaning at the back :)
This guy had posted going on about how he role plays and thinks its sad that
more dont do it. Seems he doesnt just create a character, he really goes to
town, writing a biography and fleshing out a personality, apparently he had a
dark elf that wasnt evil but wanted to be good, so he had her destroy the
starting guild note and run straight outta Neriak never to return, in the
spirit of role playing his character. Flame if you will, but id never actually
thought of going this deep into the game but thought it was a great idea and
could really bring a whole new element to the game. You would of course have to
get deep into your character and never act out of their personality but it
would be very interesting to play this way.
