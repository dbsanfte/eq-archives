    I'm telling you that the average warrior, with dual Lammys or rough
equivalent, level 55 plus, cannot break a mez off something I've MoK'ed and
not have the mob STILL go for me or the enchanter. That's with time taken
for two taunts - they aren't just kicking the things as soon as the last one
is dead. Paladin, no worries - they root before breaking, Stun if it starts
to wander. SK's chain-cast Disease Cloud, again no issues. But the average
pickup group "taunt tank" seems to be a warrior, and they seem unable to
break that mez cleanly. It's even worse if I also stunned the mob before it
got mezzed, to assist the enchanter.

    I use it to my benefit now - in open areas, like the top of Necrosis, I
can "sit kite" a mob to a surprising extent, preventing some of the damage
that would otherwise be dealt. But it's still a pain, especially in an
enclosed space like the Iksar Necro room in D2 where the only option is
standing around.

    As a warrior, what options do they have? They're hitting taunt, and not
at random. They have low-delay weapons - no high-aggro procs usually, but
you can't rely on a proc anyways. They mash themselves right up against the
mob - proximity isn't the issue. The issue is that one stun, one MoK, and
sitting is far more hate than a warrior seems to be able to generate
quickly.
