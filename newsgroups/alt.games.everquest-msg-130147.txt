I'm trying to get a computer I just built to work.  I had three old towers
with stuff in them, so I took the best from all of them.  At the moment it
is a p3 450, it's got a 3 gig hard drive (enough to hold eq), a modem, on
board sound card (bleh, but I don't really care.. I have a Sound Blaster
card I could probably throw in it, but i'm not to interested in sound beyond
hearing myself being hit while I'm in the bathroom).  Ok, the problem I'm
having is with (of course) the graphics card.  So you know i'm running XP.
I have two cards I was attempting.  The first is an ATI Rage 128.  I put it
in.. it worked fine, for what it is.  I also have a Rive TNT 2 Ultra, which
is better than the ATI, but it won't work.  I put it in, XP finds it,
installs the drivers for it (checked the XP catalog, the card is supposedly
on the list of things that are supported), but it loads up into 4bit grapics
and a resolution of 800 by 600, and it won't let me change either of those.
The monitor is horrible, btw, it's an Acer thats kind of old, but it
shouldn't effect things.. it didn't with the ATI card.  Alright, any
feedback would be much appretiated.
