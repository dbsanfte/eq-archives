maybe not, but then again noone should force someone to share if there are
other places they can camp themselves... its just plain rude. I believe
people should have rights to an xp camp, but perhaps not indefinitly. Its
never bothered me when ive been looking around for a camp, and one is
ocupied... I just move on. Moving on is one of the things that gets me about
and finding *new* camps etc etc. Not that its much of a problem these days
with kunark and velious.
