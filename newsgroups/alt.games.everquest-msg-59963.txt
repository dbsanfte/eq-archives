My Barbarian rogue is rapidly approaching level 10.  First, what would
be a good weapon or two to have during her teen years?  I would be
willing to spend 300 pp or so, or use my level 40 druid to camp
something if possible to do solo.  Right now, she is using fine steel
weapons.  I was looking at serrated bone dagger or bloodstained fang,
are these good or is there a better piercing weapon likely to be sold
for under 300pp?  I have been keeping my 1H blunt and 1H slashing
maxed as well.  

Second, under what circumstances should pickpocketing work (not
counting the actual skill level), and when can skills increase?  Is
the mob supposed to be fighting someone?  Can the skill increase even
though I'm meleeing (like foraging skill can increase even though it
always fails when sitting)?  I've only gotten one point increase and
that was from pickpocketing right after a mob aggroed on me.
