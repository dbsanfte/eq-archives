Sold 2 complete sets myself, and know at least 1 more guy are selling 
sets (i make his robes), and seen all items for sale now, but fishing 
pole seems the rarest, althougt its easy to make, people prefer buying 
instead of finding a non-kos druid or ranger to go to PoG.
Robes are quite easy on Veeshan, i sell them, or make for free if people 
bring materials, and the sickles are almost always for sale for around 
3K each.
