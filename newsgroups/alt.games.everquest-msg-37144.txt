Your reply, as well as a few recent events and incidents, contributed in my
seeing the situation of the cleric in a whole new light.

Recently, in Karnor`s Castle our cleric had done 11 xp rezes to people
outside our group without receiving a single donation.  Then, someone
shouted, offering 100 pp for a rez at the entrance.  Our bearded dwarven
cutie (not!) ran out from Captain room, rezed, returned and split the pp
with everyone in the group!  Since then, I`ve been carrying my own stack of
Peridots for Symbol of Naltron.

I have precious little time to play the game I love and I realize that their
playing time is as valuable to them.  Their rare items cost as much as mine
*plus* they have to buy spells, reagents and stuff.  Sure, some are greedy
but, surprisingly, most are very far from rich. So, when I need a rez I
offer what I know it`s worth to me.  And that`s a lot.

Very interesting read!
