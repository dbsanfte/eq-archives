    It's a hassle. Especially when you look at the philisophical
underpinnings: why do I CARE that some random tank in a pickup group gets
better? I doubt I'll ever see this random Joe again, and my giving him loot
X because it beats what he has doesn't stop him from heading to EC, selling
the loot, and coming back to do it again.

    The system I always suggest, which is always met by gasps of horror, is
replacement NBG. If you say "I NEED the Lammy", fine. Give us whatever 1HS
you use now to roll on, and you can have the Lammy. It isn't a perfect
system - No Drop items, cheap junk that's effective in certain slots
("here's my Straw Spun Belt, gimme the FBSS!"), but by and large it would
deter folks who cry NBG and sell what they get.

    What do I usually do? I go with NBG if I like the people I'm with, and
there's no scamming going on. One guild had a group leader in the camp that
drops the Lammy rotating guild warriors in and out of the camp as they won
Lammys, for example.

    Taunting tanks, ourselves, and enchanters. ;-)

    Ten and a half, max faction/CHA. Trust me, this I know VERY well. ;-)

>Star Sapphire, Fire Emerald, etc
>dropping that are considered "common gems" go for an easy 100pp each.

    If we're in Seb, the "common gem" drops are Fire Opal, Star Ruby, Fire
Emerald, Sapphire. There is a fifth, Ruby, but it is a drop off the Planar
Gems table and as such is fairly rare. Of the four mentioned above, the vast
majority of gem drops will be Fire Opals. Those sell for 50 plat with max
faction and CHA. The other three go up in value from there, with the
Sapphire pulling in around 100 plat.

>Clerics shield that was casted lasts about 1 hour, so thats say 72pp spent
>for one hours worth of buffs.

    Most clerics restock in places where faction isn't always capped, and do
so at less than 110 CHA, so that's about right. Naltron only being 54 mins
will bring the lower cost to about what you have it pegged at.

>Say five "common gems" drop within that one
>hour.

    That might be a low drop rate, in my experience. You DO also get the odd
cash item that's a non-gem, like Mithril Amulets and the like. But gems drop
better than 5 per hour, still.

>Thats about 400-500pp worth of gems.

    See above on gem costs. You're looking at closer to 250 to 350 per hour
at best, in my experience. Actually, I do have a more accurate measure: last
trip to Seb, I came back and cleared (after restocking) 4000 plat roughly. I
was there for ten or 12 blubs, so 20 to 25 hours. So 160 to 200 plat per
hour above and beyond my peridot costs. I will note that I've never gotten
all common gems, but I was looting all three scarabs in NG for some of that
time and the bulk of the cash I got came from selling those planar
jewelcraft items.

    Um, did you mention that the cleric also was being good and staying
glued to the floor while everyone else looted and got 5 to 8 plat per
critter? Plus the odd jewelry item, plus words/runes (don't look at me, they
sell for 1 plat each and stack)? Did you mention that the cleric usually
gives up rights to roll on much of what drops, based on NBG?

    It apparently gets even worse on raids, where clerics are expected to
provide peridots by the ton and are rarely compensated for them. But that's
a separate issue, even though many clerics claim that XP groups should
subsidize the raids clerics go on.

    Most tanks I meet could buy and sell me with their weapons alone. Heck,
most cleric twinks of tanks I know are better-equipped than I am. It's sad,
but one third of my armour (6/17 slots) was purchased when I was level 26 -
CGS, SSB, Ad Eps, Cloak of the Ice Bear, two Bracers of the Reverent. And I
got lucky in getting a Hero Bracer to sell at that level to afford all that
(bracers were quested).

    Half the groups I meet don't give the cleric anything, so I compensate
by being a bad cleric and looting until I feel I'm at quota. If the group
gives me a gem or two at the beginning and never again for a three hour
session (most common), I drop that back to looting the same as everyone else
but attempt to "cherry pick" the mobs that have more gems / items off the
planar table. If I get one or two Fire Opals per buff cycle, or one gem per
person at the start, I'll loot less than the average - but I rarely if ever
see that happen.

    The fights would break out over how much money the items are worth,
though. "Am I getting my FAIR share?" You'd also have more time spent in EC,
which is never good. The current system is flawed, but it's about as good as
it gets.
