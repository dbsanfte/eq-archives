You da man  :-) I've got a couple pie tin molds but doubt if my
smithing skill is even close to high enough. Actaully if you could
give Hackle a tell it would be a help because I don't have you on my
new install friend list yet. ummm pie, I can almost taste it  :-) Or
come to think of it I'll ask Darkensolo for your char names to add,
anywho  see you later. Never mind, don't mind me I have pie fever,
Wood Elves get that you know.
