In Tactics, I've had buffs down to the 7th slot or so dispelled while 
making our way through there.  I only keep 2 junk buffs up, and try to 
keep my self buffs in the next slots, so I can easily replace them, and 
yet it still was not enough on the last run through there.  Prior to 
that, it had always been just the top junk buff that got dispelled.
