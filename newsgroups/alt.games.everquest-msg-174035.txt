Your inability to present a rebuttal is duly noted.

Tip for people running away from an exchange:  Writing
things like "snipped: nothing at all of substance"
only calls attention to the fact that you had to
dodge an entire post.  It's better to just make
the traditional "I won because you're too stupid"
post and run for the exits.  Oh, look, here it comes now:

>Dan....your post has shown nothing other than your ignorance about your

ROFL!

Pot, kettle, black...  You're the poster child for "patronising
and insulting remarks".  Need I remind you that before I even
jumped in here, you had established a track record of saying
things like:

# Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11.
# You only link the two because you are told you should.
# Get a brain.

That one blew the fuse in the old patronising-and-insulting-ometer.
I'm sending you the repair bill, fella.

Then you have the gall to say that *I'm* unable to discuss
the issue "other than by making patronising and insulting remarks"?
My god, what a flaming hypocrite you are.

Look up "psychological projection", you might find it educational.  


>Good luck to you on your travels through the world.

With you no longer preaching your belligerent ignorance
to me, my luck has improved already.
