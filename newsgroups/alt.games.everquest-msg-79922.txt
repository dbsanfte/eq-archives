In an earlier post you stated "A warrior and a cleric" could take
Brother Z. Now you are changing the story. 8 People is nearly 2
groups, and I bet most of those 8 were 53+. I bet those 8 people had a
great time helping the monk(s) in their guild get the robe. I am sure
the experience was more rewarding than a lone monk camping the same
spawn for 30 hours or more while his guild mates are off doing things
together.

Congratulations on all you have accomplished.

Do you think putting in your time makes you a better monk than someone
who kills Brother Z for the robe? Does being a "good monk" mean
spending 38 hours or more camping for the robe? Is there a chart I can
reference detailing how many hours I must camp for the various quests
to achieve non-"Gimp" status?

So if I want to skip an insanely long camp in order to keep EQ
entertaining for me and less of a "job", I become a "Gimp Monk" (your
words)?

We can both agree on these points.

I do plan on camping Raster, but I don't think I will have much luck.
So far each time I have gone down to LG he was already camped with a
list of people waiting.
