What if he didn't want him to "be nice?" He didn't ask for help and he
didn't ask for interference.

What is that saying? The road to becoming an annoying player in Evequest is
paved with good intentions. Yeah, something like that.

Do you know how much time and money it takes to build my archery skill? I'd
be rather ticked if some knucklehead came along and wiped out my target
because he thought he was helping. I'd gladly understand and forgive if he
was a genuine fellow, but the guy Rvou describes sounds like a nitwit.

It wasn't a kill steal, but it certainly crossed the line of good etiquette.
