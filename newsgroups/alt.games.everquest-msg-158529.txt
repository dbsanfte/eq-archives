I used Remedy until the introduction of Ethereal Remedy.  In fact as I leveled
up I used it more rather than less.  Divine Light takes forever to cast when you
NEED it, and isn't particularly efficient.  Remedy is fast enough and large
enough to do almost any job DL might, even if you may have to cast it twice.
Best thing about Remedy, though (and I didn't realize this till very late) is
its extraordinary range.  You can reach out and touch people halfway across a
small zone like City of Mist, its the ideal spell for keeping a puller alive and
healthy (preferably while he's lying down FD)

This is the spell that prevents DL from being useful.  Its large and cheap, and
is rarely wasted on anyone being hit, while DL often hits for less than its full
potential.  I'd only mem DL when large fast heals are absolutely going to be
required, or if they gave me an extra four spell mem slots.

> 3) CH

I only drop this when there's noone in my group with over 3khp and tanking isn't
the plan.  Note that this includes pets.  Very often CHeal is the only heal
worth using on a pet.

Stun one is more useful than all your other stuns combined.  Its cheapest, its
fastest and it does the only jobs that matter in a stun; interrupts casters,
stops melee from hitting for a bit, and stops runners for a bit.  The other
stuns do the same, but for more mana, slower, and worst of all, they do
damage... so they can break mez.

Undead Nuke is a great buy, but I'd move it to slot 4 most of the time, as an
either/or.  How often do you need both a regular and an undead nuke?  Nothing
should take that stun 1 out of its slot, until you hit the nightmare levels
where most mobs are immune to stun.

> 6) Shield of Words/Stun 2/Pacify

AC buff?  Can't imagine why.  Rarely useful as more than a tank pacifier, has
very little real effect on combat.  Pacify?  There are rumors this line works
now, its hard for me to imagine.  Stun 2, yes, that can be useful in some
situations.  I'd put DB in this slot more often than not, though.

I like Root.  Again, its cheap, its fast, and it does the job as well as
anything else.   Immobilize is another option, if mana is no object, its even
faster.  Enstill... well frankly its rarely useful, its slower, more expensive,
and rarely lasts any longer than root.  Atone is a nice tool from time to time,
very handy travelling if you aren't faster than mobs, or if someone gets into
trouble.  But by putting root and atone in the same slot you lose half its
effect; root a mob at a distance from your group, atone it, and you've rid
yourself of it as surely as if your whole group had FD (assuming you manage to
wipe all the hate with that atone)
