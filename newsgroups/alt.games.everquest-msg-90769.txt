Researched spells between levels 34 and 44 for enchanters are available 
from a vendor in Katta Castellum, in the caster tower (click on the 
tapestry thing to TP between floors). I think those ones are level 20ish 
though so you're SoL - you'll have to research them or find someone who 
has.

A good place to try would be posting a WTB message on the Sol Ro 
messageboard at
