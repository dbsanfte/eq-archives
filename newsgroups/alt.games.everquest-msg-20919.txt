Maybe it takes very little mana at 39...but BOY is that sucker expensive
when necros get it at 8.   For it to MAYBE proc once/fight?  Eh, I was
hoping GJ would get answers that would support a necro's use of it.  I mean,
it won't be long now 'til I stop meleeing completely.   Now, if it was
TARGETABLE that spell would rock.
