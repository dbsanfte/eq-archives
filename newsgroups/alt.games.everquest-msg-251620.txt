This is actually built into the Spellcrafting tradeskill in DAoC.  It
happens when one tries to "overcharge" an item.  Each player crafted item,
weapon, or armor, has X imbue points.  Each gem a crafter can apply to an
item is Y imbue points.  If a crafter attempts to add Y+Y+Y+Y > X, an
"overcharge" there is a percentage chance that there will be and explosion
and the crafter will be killed.  The percentage chance increases the greater
the overcharge points.  Of course all components also where destroyed in the
explosion.  Sadly this only applies to Spellcrafting, and only when trying
to push the envelope.

It was actually funny when it first came out, reading the death messages.  I
was disappointed however that there was no graphic.  I would have loved to
have seen a huge explosion when it happened.

They where kind enough to not actually charge you experience for the death,
nor did they send you back to your bind point.  You simply "reappeared" at
the point of your death seconds later.
