Yes, but plate armor turns all weapons into blunt weapons.  Thats the beauty of
it, it spreads the damage out over a large area very well.

Tried it have you?  Because its common wisdom, but its not actually
particularly true.  Plate armor is marginally heavier than leather, lighter
than chain, and if well made doesn't constrict movement at all.  This is easier
than it looks, because the human body hides its levers under flexible flesh,
but really you only move at the joints, and only in a limited range of
movement.  Articulate the plate to accomodate that range of movement and you
are golden.

Yes indeed, I think monks should have higher avoidance abilities and warriors
higher HP totals.  What I don't think should happen is that both should take
damage the same; monks should have chunky damage, where they either avoid the
blow or get really creamed, warriors should get gradually worn down by bruise
after bruise.

The guy in plate doesn't have the steel driven thru his body, he got poked with
the end of a baseball bat.  Ooof, says he, don't do that!  Meanwhile the guy
who wasn't wearing armor is doing his imitation of a shishkabob, unless he
managed to get out of the way in time.  So the warrior gets hit time and again
and keeps coming, while the martial artist avoids the blows or ends up on the
floor in relatively short order.

The myth of the foil is a popular one, but picking out tiny moving targets
areas on a live and aware opponent isn't all that easy.  Hitting someone
somewhere is one thing, hitting that little hole under the armpit is another.
Take a look at the guards on most rapiers if you want a stunning
counterexample; basketwork hilts that clearly sport holes that another rapier
blade could exploit, and right there on the hand, which is the part thats
easiest to hit on a fencer.  And yet the hand is rarely hit, because the open
wire work is more than adequate to prevent injuries to the hand if you keep the
hand moving.  Plate stops a piercing weapon very well most of the time, and
I've never said its impossible to kill someone in a suit of the stuff, just a
lot harder than someone wearing a TShirt.

Oh, and no, this isn't slashing weapons.  Slashing is completely ineffective
against plate, but nobody would try it.  Swords are used against plate like
you'd use a baseball bat, swing and connect, follow thru, smash them silly.
Katanas, scimitars, sabers, cutlasses and the like, curved weapons, were
slashers, used effectively against unarmored or leather armored people, who can
be cut.  Straight bladed swords concentrate the force of a swung blow along a
narrow line, chopping if you like, not slashing (which is more along the lines
of sawing, keeping the blade edge sliding along the contact surface)

At any rate, extending my "what does it feel like" list, getting hit full on by
a thrust from a rapier while wearing plate armor feels like someone walking up
to you and pushing you with their open hand, getting a thrust from a rapier
while wearing chain is more like someone poking you hard with one finger.  In
leather or cloth, its a lot like having a knife stab you straight thru and out
the other side, though, very effective.

Wearing chain without padding under it isn't too clever, I'll grant you that.
But I doubt it really meant more injuries than it prevented, if you'd been
wearing nothing the weapon would have taken the arm  off and you'd have died
just the same.  So it only saved half as many lives as it might have... but
wearing padding or leather underneath stopped the links being driven into the
body by all but the strongest blows.  I'd have to challenge your theory that it
stops piercing any better than plate, though, it tends to trap a point far more
often, and a lot of the reason plate works on piercers is that it deflects the
blows.

If you want a weapon that really makes a hash of plate, its heavy swung
weapons; a mace, an axe, a seax... but worst of all, a warhammer or pick; a
swung piercer puts a lot more force behind the point than a thruster, and the
mechanics of swinging make it a lot harder to deflect the point.  This is why
many knights carried warhammers in case of close combat with another armored
opponent; blunt on one end (thus the hammer) they taper to a point on the other
end.   Maces and the like, though, just yeilded to the fact that hitting a man
in armor didn't yeild cuts or even thin line breaks; if you are going to be
hitting a man who's going to take the blow like it was coming from a baseball
bat, why not shape the weapon like a baseball bat; a big heavy metal club that
concentrates force enough to smash the plate itself, breaking bones inside
without penetrating, or just smashing the articulation enough to reduce freedom
of movement, or using the freedom of movement to move the bones inside past
where they can normally move, breaking elbows or knees or even necks.

But the death of plate as a form of protection was a thrust blunt weapon, of
sorts; lead balls out of musket barrels.  These would punch thru any normal
steel armor you could wear, and "proofed" armor was so heavy it was indeed as
difficult to fight in as most people assume normal plate is, plus the expense
was prohibative.  When people stopped wearing plate (because it wasn't helping
anymore against the principle means of killing) then the rapier really came
into its own, as while a light point isn't much of a threat to someone encased
in sheet steel, its great against unarmored opponents, with speed and reach
that nothing else can match, plus used well its perfectly adequate for
deflecting other weaponry. Suddenly instead of heavier and heavier armor, and
weapons that went from one handed to two handed, from balanced towards the hilt
to balanced out towards the end like that baseball bat I keep going back to,
and getting longer and longer to develop more and more angular momentum,
there's a radical change to very light weight one handed weapons that could be
weilded at arms length and moved quickly to protect an unarmored body and to
strike one with a stabbing thrust or slashing cut.

Everquest simplifies these ideas a lot, all weapons do the same sort of
unspecified damage, as do mobs, and armor, when it does anything at all, works
as a mitigating factor to decrease damage done, and only occaisionally to
deflect it entirely, while parrying, blocking, dodging and riposting all either
give you full "didn't get hit" effect or none at all.  But heck, its only a
game, and I don't really ask that it support the real world physics of the
situation yet; give games another ten years, right now they are trying to
duplicate the AD&D feel of combat, rather than the more advanced systems of
GURPs or Iron Crown, much less modeling reality in all its grittiness.
