Fortunately for me this was about a month before they nerfed
pottery as a money maker (ooooh - you could make 50+ PP an hour 
:-P)  I went from naked and broke to having all my gear back -
then deleted my pottery mule just before the sketch fiasco
(they boosted the prices on pie pan sketches - however the people
who knew it was coming loaded up backpack after backpack before
the patch and then sold them afterward for a very large (for the
day) profit).
