  Thought I'd answer this in a bit more detail. :)  The players supposedly
will have more or less complete control over the way their town is run.  I
don't think there will be "factions" in the automated EQ sense of the word.
Instead, the guild who "owns" the guard NPCs will be able to give those
guards a list of characters or guilds whom they should attack on sight.
This also will encourage "responsible" behavior in the sense that if you are
an a-hole PKer who becomes notorious around a certain town, you may end up
getting your entire guild banned from the town, thus you may find it
difficult to even find a guild that will keep you.

  As for "Dens of Villainy", you're probably right, but the way they seem to
be structuring it is so that towns can be a major stream of revenue and loot
if run properly.  If you don't feel "protected" in a town from PKers, you
probably won't go there, and thus the guild running that town will be denied
the money from your business buying gear and selling loot.  They won't have
anybody to make money off of if nobody wants to go to their town, so they
will essentially have to depend entirely on themselves and their PKing
skills to amass wealth.  Again, that's just the theory.  Who knows if it'll
work, and who knows if SB will even be a reality.
