2 different option, one more likely than the other.

1. Unlikely you were in "duck" mode, crouched down. You run slowly this way.

2. More likely, somewhere by accident you hit CTRL-R at some point. This
puts you in walk mode. Hit CTRL-R again and see if you speed up. If you slow
down even more, I have no idea what is wrong.
