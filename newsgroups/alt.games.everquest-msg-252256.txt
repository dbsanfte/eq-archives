I duoed from the ent to the GY without too much difficulty in the mid 
20s. Bard & Pali (not 2 boxed). A full group would just roll through it. 
But over all yeah, I agree... it wasn't until we were 38th that we could 
duo Xicotl and Sir Bronthas. A full group would have done it earlier... 
but it would still be 30+.

Then again the Gunthak recommendation is really just for the beach. 
Deeper in it gets quite a bit harder, as the mobs hit harder, and there 
are casters too... getting feared in around the fort is pretty much a 
death sentence...
