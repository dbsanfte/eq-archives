Hehe, the whole point of that zone is to screw with your head.
The mobs in there proc some sort of "curse" that turns people into
some type of NPC model.  Funny as hell when our cleric turned into a
big bug.

Not so funny when I realized I was playing with the PC names turned
off.

Oh well, be sure to bring a six pack with you when you decide to
'splore Grieg's.  That shit is much easier to deal with when you've
had a few.
