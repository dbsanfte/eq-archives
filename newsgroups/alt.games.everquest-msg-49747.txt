You're kidding me. Every time I camped there after max half an hour or so
the bloody lord would be up and I had to log in my main to wipe him.
My groups usually pulled anything inside, but the front slaver always got
kicked the second he spawned so we had a way out. He might be a PH, but the
Hero didn't spawn often. The lord did though.

btw. I've camped Mino's for rougly 3 levels in about the same amount of days
and helped 2 other guildies' alts there. Total time not more then 2 weeks I
think, but I've killed LOADS of lords.

Does anyone know is there is a PH for the Emissary as well? He wiped me a
few times and I never knew when to expect him.
