> Cut the member loose?

If your a hardcore raid guild and one of your members goes soft then 
yes. Think about it... the average guild in this category has 
probationary periods, sponsoship to get in, high gear requirements, high 
aa requirements, and high playtime requirements. If I joined such a 
guild, and then promptly stripped my character of all his gear should I 
be allowed to stay? How is cutting your play time in half, dropping 
below guild requirements, any different?

It was an either or proposition. The other being the much more friendly, 
*MODIFY THE POLICY SO YOU DON'T SCREW THEM* choice. Doing nothing at all 
leaves them languishing in guild limbo... tagged as a member, actively 
playing (just not enough). but disqualified from the membership 
benefits. How is that a positive?
