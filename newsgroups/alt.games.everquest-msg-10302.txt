Every now any again someone will start preaching about the "one true god"
normally in shouts and normally replied to in character from clerics, shaman
and druid players :ï¿½) During one of these "Believe in ...." episodes I piped
up "Believe in Angels" and got a tell asking if I was a
christian...erm...right, perhaps the film wasn't as famous/infamous as I
thought.

Not that I have anything against religeon I just don't want to hear about it
in EQ, not even on Sundays
