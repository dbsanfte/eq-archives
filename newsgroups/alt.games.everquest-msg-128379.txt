I was under the impression the OP wanted to target the other mob -- the one
the tank is not going to break mez on next time his or her weapon delay
cycles.  Can this be hotkeyed?  Sometimes, "A Dar Ghoul Knight" stands so
close to its buddy with an identical name, the chanter can really only know
he or she has the right one targetted once the one the tank is fighting has
lost some health.  A hotkey to target the "off" mob would be a fantastic
help.
