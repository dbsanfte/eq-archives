Hopefully if the patch hasn't screwed everything up, I will be attempting
the last part of the Shaman epic for my main.  Are there any tips on how to
kill Lord Rah for the final battle in CoM?  I just don't want to have to
make another trip to Fear for the childs tear.   I have heard that Mages are
the key, I'm bringing about 2 to 3 groups and will have three mages range
between lvl 54 and 65.

Thanks for any advice in advance,

Banala <Trinity Alliance> - 59 Ogre Shaman - Prexus
