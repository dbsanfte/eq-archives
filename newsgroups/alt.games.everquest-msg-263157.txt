    Once fear is perma-resisted, we're down to agro kiting. Take a look at
our pet DPS parses and the damage our dots do. That is NOT viable soloing
ray.

    Purely talking XP groups?

    We no longer have significant advantage in agro over warriors, who have
a significant HP/mitigation advantage.

    Pallies have a large mitigation advantage from stuns.

    Our ever increasing vampiric AA's, spells, etc are making inroads but if
you do the numbers we're way, way behind.
