A hell of a lot better - most of the time.  I don't know how but I got
it to just switch with Alt+Tab for about an hour.  If we could figure
out how this happenend, it would almost be worth it.  Then it crashed
while I had a charmed hasted dual wielding pet fighting two mobs.  I got
lucky, charm lasted through my link death and I came back alive with
both characters, lost my velium weapons though.  After that it was back
to alt-tab alt-enter alt-enter again :(

Sometime when switching in default my mouse wouldn't work and I'd have
to alt-enter a couple more times :(

About 2 minutes for 2nd account to load up on default, EQW usually takes
about 5-10 minutes, so much better.  I noticed EQW loads up faster if
you have it on the account loading.

Yep.  I also have crash to desktop problems, or eternal zone problems
when zoning with EQW up in two windows (works fine with one window)

O.k. tested again, Still looks dirty in default.  Also my radeon has
software that is supposed to automatically detect a game is running and
adjust the gama, it doesn't work in default, so everything is much
darker.  

I also noticed *more* lag PoK with default.  other zones were less.  I
think what's going on is the other session is mostly suspended (at least
the video is) so your graphics card only has to consentrate on one
window.  Thus you get less lag.  With EQW your card is rendering both
simultaneously, which also has the advantage that you can see your
seccond session at the same time.

This also causes one other problem.  with default, I could not follow -
The other character I wasn't in at the moment continued to warp back to
where he started.  If I moved off a little bit and waited a LOOONG time
he would eventually get there, but it was far quicker to move each
separately.  With EQW I can easily have one following the other, I have
to have the second one slightly quicker somehow, such as sow vs. jboots
for him to keep up, but it does work.  

Note, I usually play using EQW with one account, maybe logging on my
friend's cleric for a buff or something.  EQW for one window far
outweighs defaut, it's no slower, you can move the window around, and
you don't loose your video if you go look at something else in another
window, the only disadvantage it has is you can't go back to full
screen, but I've gotten used to playing in the window.
