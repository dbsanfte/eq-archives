No, druids are great on raids because they are a "swiss army knife"
class. This is the stuff that my 55 druid does on raids:

1) give people circles (soon you'll be able to do that without joining
there group to give for) this is one of the most important things we
do, mainly in TOV. Our fire and cold circles are still the best way to
do those resses on groups.

2) give regrowth of the grove (especially if have the tov quest bp) or
other pack regens

3) Str people or sln people if they don't have a bigger buff.

4) group with casters and other non tanks and often save their behinds
with heal. There never seem to be enough clerics around for every
group so they are often concentrated with the tanks.

5) use faster heal chlorplast on targeted main tanks when clerics are
doing their take turns CHing them thing, this really can't be
underestimated as its often the difference between a tank possibly
dying and them not dying.

6) often give a chloroplast if a tank is getting low even if the
cleric is ch'ing them, often also made the difference between the tank
living or dying.

7) debuff mobs with first ro's sundering then the higher fixation of
ro. Both lower fire res and fixation lowerd mob ac by 20  or
something. We even do this in tov, every little bit helps. 

8) take some people home afterwards because its kind of hard on the
wizards to TL and port everyone.

Porting is about the least useful needed thing that I do on a raid,
circles is probably one of the most when resses are pretty important.
The other things we do are a lot like shamans but the shamans are busy
slowing  the mob and such.

Porters don't WANT to port people. Its only good cash flow when you
are level 29 and people have the money to pay you 50 or 100 plat for a
port and you are a non twink. Even then its better in the long run for
you to be off making xp and money the regular way. I WANT people to
have alternative means, in fact now that the gnome ports people from
nro to iceclad (npc gnome by the nro boat dock) and BACK, I suggest
they get there that way.

You can't "ruin" what was never intended in the first place. Group
ports were ALWAYS meant to be for your GROUP and to give the druid
and wizard added value in that way the same as group evacs are meant
to save your group. They were meant so that your group of pals could
go and check a dungeon like solb and find it was full then group gate
on the spot to sro and go and check guk. Ports were never intended to
be a way to make ghetto amounts of money zoning over and over.
