Kaev, I snip things I'm not directly responding to.  It's common etiquette
in newsgroups, but for you I have included your whole post (not bothering to
reinsert the points of mine you deleted) so you don't accuse me of
"judicious" snipping.

You're wrong on so many levels here, but I'm quite sure now you're not going
to be backing off from your amusing, but ultimately incorrect, comparison
between this game of EQ and real life.  But here's one last try....

1.  You continue to insist that people *are* their characters.  That is a
fatal mistake in your reasoning.  Your syllogism, "The OP is a real person"
+ "Person received a gift" + "Person didn't value gift" = "Person doesn't
value charity" is false because the assumptions are false.

1a.  Yes, players are RL people.  Characters in the game are not.  Did
Shakespeare, after the trickery of his "friend" Iago, kill his wife?
Certainly not.  But he directed his character Othello to kill Desdemona, and
it made a stirring play.

Many of my points you snipped in your last reply are examples of how we
direct our characters in EQ to do things in the game that we *never* would
in RL.  Examples like those completely invalidate your false generalization
that people's actions in the game correlate to how they react in the real
world.

But I'll play along with you for a little longer....  :)

2.  Let's take it a step further, out of intellectual curiosity.  Let us
assume (though we certainly have no evidence of this) that Horatio is quite
ill emotionally, and he is so enmeshed in the game and his character that he
doesn't distinguish between the two.  I'm not talking about temporary
suspension of disbelief here...he could always come to his senses from that
and make his character do something that he in real life would never try.
Let's just say (and I apologize, Horatio) that he has lost his grip on
reality and is totally and irrevocably immersed in the fantasy.

(This sounds similar to me to you're arguing, Kaev, seeing how you never
differentiate between "his actions as a person" and how he directs his
character to act in the game.  No, you don't say he's mentally ill, only
unable to distinguish between his RL and the game.  Indeed, in your last
post, you argue there *is no difference* between in game goods, emotions,
interactions, and their real life counterparts.  Which, if it were the case,
I'm glad I don't resemble a Gnoll in too many ways....)

2a.  To continue with the point, though, should he be immersed to the point
of insanity, Horatio would indeed act and react in the game just as a person
would react to life.  But....

2b.  ...there is a very big problem here.  The rules of the "game" are very
different from the rules of real life.  Rewards come from different
activities, consequences take different forms, and the very laws of physics
... your character's capabilities ... are different!

To specifically touch the realm of economics, where you're seem to be
focusing your effort on this lost cause, there are abundant posts already to
this group that this "EQ economy" has little or no resemblance to the real
world.  There are many reasons for this that have been explored in those
threads.  Some posters have even adopted the term, "MUDflation" to
differentiate how differently the economic rules work in the game.

With the rules of these two "worlds" so different, how can you expect even
the person who has lost his grip on the real world to react the same way in
this game as he would have in RL?  He will be reacting to the ruleset of the
EQ programmers, not the ruleset of RL!  Different rules, different "game",
different reactions.

That is the second place your generalization breaks down.

But, gladly, for most people, EQ is a *GAME*.  Escapist fantasy.  And I
suspect that's why so many people get such a kick out of playing.  I know I
like being released from the rules we all abide by day in and day out!

> hth, feel free to have the last word,
> kaev

I've enjoyed the "thought exercise", Kaev, but as a newsgroup veteran like
yourself knows, there is no last word in Usenet.   :)

Best regards,
Mort
