 Give me some numbers.. What makes you rank things in this order? I'm
not saying they are wrong I'm just saying it looks like you're pulling
things out of the air without anything to back them up.

 Who said anything about better? You said monk equipment is trash.
Perhaps Monk only items are lacking but in my opinion anything a monk
can wear is considered 'monk equipment'. If I can wear it it's monk
equipment.
