I have been dual boxing a warrior/druid combo and started to run into
some problems at level 40.

This is the first two characters I have dual boxed from 1 to 40 so I
have had to adjust my normal hunting zones and all has gone very well
till now.

I just moved to DL and the mobs are turning my warrior into a mana
sponge. My downtime has gone way up. 

What zones work well for partners in the 40 to 60 range? Mobs with low
hp's and few adds would be nice. Most of the zones I hunted in during
my 40's and 50's I did so in full groups and my goal is to keep these
two together till they hit the 50's.
