Turns out I assumed they'd already done that to no effect. That they'd 
been ignored and brushed off.

Can anyone provide a link that indicates one way or the other?

Personally I don't see anyone, even children cum activists, failing to 
at least make their complaint known before going and protesting for it.

Protests are inneffective if you aren't making a spectacle of yourself. 
It sort of goes with the territory.

I thought it was clever. But then I butted heads with 'school 
administration' growing up so often it wasn't funny... and nearly every 
time parents had to get involved. School administrations frequently 
don't listen to students, whether their complaints are legitimate or 
not.
