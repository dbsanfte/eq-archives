Shrug. How much is invis worth to you when a cleric needs it? In my
level (56+) and dungeons, where many people sit near each other exping
(Velks, sebilis), dead people normally drag their corpses to a group.
And in nearly all cases get a free rez. If the cleric has his epic,
then it's just a right click anyway.

Sure. Depends on the situation I think. People demanding a rez, while
a group is fighting or nearly dead etc are just a nuisance. If your
group is sittign aorund in a prep-raid buffing interval, a rez won't
hurt.

As for epiced clerics, only an asshole would deny a rez for a person,
who dragged his/her corpse to the cleric. However, there's people
expectign a cleric to walk off group and stay off for 15 minutes,
wandering wherever, to get their rez. Not even guildmates shoudl
expect that, if there's other clerics nearby etc. I've seen guild
clerics wander HUGE distances though to get a mate out of danger in a
low populate zone before his corpse rots. Nice of them.

Depends on what disrupt and great distance is to you. I don't play a
cleric, but if I would, nobody in zone would get a rez from me, if
they don't drag their corpse to me. If they're polite, drag their
corpse and my group doesn't really need all of my mana right now
(quite common in high level groups with a slowing shaman etc), then
I'd rez for free. I am a Shaman, I buff/sow/EB/ultavis etc people for
free. I don't like this 'I only do it for $$' attitude, but that's me.
If I get 20 tells a minute, things would look different.

Sort of. I had clerics ask me for money in my younger levels up to
about level 45. Right now in 56, there's often enough a click-stick
cleric in the zone or some cleric in an AFk group etc. If I ask
politely, most will help me for free. I always ask what I owe them,
but they nearly never demand anything (same for high level druids
porting if they got time etc). I like suck things, and polite people
always get what they want from me, given I have time. It's an attitude
to support IMHO (OK not always .. was in a bad mood last week and
pissed a buff beggar off *grin*).
