Well, one of my favorite characters ever was a Monk. I made him when RoK
came out and had a great time with him, and then I stopped playing EQ and
when I came back to the game I started on a different server. Oh well.

Anyway, I think I'm going to restart him, and I have some questions about
high level Monk play that I'd like answered.


1.) Do Iksar Monks have a hard time with good Monk Quests, particularly the
Epic Weapon? Are these reliant on any kind of human faction, and if so, is
there a workaround? Also, has Verant done anything since the release of RoK
to try to balance Human Monks with Iksar Monks? Are there any less obvious
disadvantages to an Iksar(besides the occasional equipment limitations)?

2.) About how much damage does a high level monk do on average, per punch?
What about with a decent blunt weapon?

3.) How much damage does Flying Kick do at high levels, and how long is its
reuse time?

4.) Feign Death.. I know its uses out of combat, but if you use it during
combat, is it similar to a Rogue's Evade? For example, let's say the Monk is
#1 on the hate list and the tank is #2, if the monk were to feign death and
get back up, would the mob stay on the tank, or would it again recognize the
Monk's place on its hate list and attack it again?

5.) After a Monk feign pulls, will he still be able to attack as normal
without bringing heavy aggro on himself, or is he forced to limit his damage
output as a result of his premature aggro?

6.) How requested are Monks in high level groups? Are they generally useful
for their damage capabilities, or only their excellent pulling?


Please answer whatever you can. Monk responses would be most appreciated,
but any input is welcome.
