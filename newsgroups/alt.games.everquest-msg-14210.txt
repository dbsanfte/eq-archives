Yes, but measures, and countermeasures HAVE changed.  He got in by using
the innate trust of .edu systems.  Once you have root on one system,

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
