Oh, get off your damn high horse.  I agree with the RP restrictions, but 
think you can joyfully fuck off if you're going to pull the 'it was hard 
for me, it should be hard for everyone' card.
Why don't you just not help any ranger created after the hybrid exp fix?  
They have it 40% easier than you did, the Pecks only have it another 5% 
easier.  
Oh, and don't for a minute think we don't continue to mock rangers.  Even 
the one we like.
