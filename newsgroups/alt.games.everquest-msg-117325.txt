Tee-hee, I put the thx in there just to annoy certain regulars =p

Anyway, I canceled my account today, after three years and two
months of wholesome fun and wholesale slaughter of various orcs,
giants, frogloks and goblins. I had a lot of fun with it while
it lasted, and I'm sure there will be times when I'll regret
canceling. But it's been a while since I realized that, for me,
the high-end game gets boring, and I tired of leveling up chars
just to start a new twink when my current main hit the fifties.

In fact, thinking back on it, I don't think I've ever played a
computer game that had such an impact on me as Everquest did.
From the fearful run with newbie trolls from Innothule Swamp to
Nektulos Forest, on Ralllos Zek (and getting attacked in North
Ro by a red-to-me magician, and going LD just as I got attacked)
to the first time my guild managed to beat tough boss mobs, the
game sure offered a lot of thrills. And the various friends in
various countries around the world will be missed, obviously.

But now it's time for me to quit. I hope you guys have lots of
fun playing the game, and if you lurk and wonder whether to try
it or not, I can sure recommend it, even as I'm quitting it.
And who knows, maybe I've regained my lust for adventure by the
time EQ2 comes?

Rune

[1] A Bristlebane worshipper, as befits rogues, and with boosts
to dex and agi, because back then, everyone knew those were the
important rogue stats! And he wielded a SBD and a Stiletto of
the Bloodclaw, how uber those were back then!
