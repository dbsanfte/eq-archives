No it isn't.  I, at least, consider things happening to people in the 
group very on-topic.

}Lenny got
}hit by a runaway parked car tonight while he was sitting on his bike,
}and I got punched in the face when I tried to get the license number of
}the car that did it.  We're both fairly ok, if shaken.

That's awful!  But I'm glad you're ok.

/em hug Annie
/em considers hugging Lenny, but worries about being mistaken for food.

}And I'm thinking that a cold beer might be a Good Thing right now.  Lenny 
}seems to be enjoying his, in a comatose sort of way.

There must be a cleric of Brell hereabouts!

}Oh, and the bad guys got away.

Grr!  I hate people who train.  I wish you could get them banned. :(
