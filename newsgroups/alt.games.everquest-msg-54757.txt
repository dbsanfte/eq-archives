HI all

I am sure people sometime get sick of the "where should I hunt" questions,
but I have one anyway!

Any suggestions where a Level 26 cleric should go for the next 10 levels or
so?  Currently in Highkeep, but bored with Goblins.

Best place to me means:


1.  Decent Mobs that drop useful stuff
2. Cleric, so solo not my thing
3.  However, been with some shocking groups that get the casters killed

So, somewhere "interesting"  where I can find a group suitable.

By looking around a few web sites, The Overthere looks like a possible place
to go.  Just wondering if there are any other suggestions?

Thanks in advance
