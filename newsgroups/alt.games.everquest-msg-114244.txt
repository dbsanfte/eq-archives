    What I don't really understand is the fact that it's such a CS burden
for Verant to even have boats. What they should do is just add an NPC to
port you at each dock. During my short stint as an apprentice guide, I'd
guess that 20% of all petitions involve boats and people falling off of them
or getting put in a safe spot on an island in the middle of the ocean. Now,
I know you can hunt in the ocean zones and that's easily solveable by just
leaving the boats in, but let people know that if you're just crossing,
don't bother taking it. I dunno. Just seems like a lot of trouble for some
"realism" in a fantasy game.
