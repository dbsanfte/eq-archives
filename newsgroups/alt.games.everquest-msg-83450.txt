My main is a 56 cleric.  I want to start another toon for when I'm
sick of groups or just plain can't find one (for those 3am nighttime
urges to play eq).  I know under normal circumstances the necro is is
king of soloing.  But I've always liked shammys.  Then a guildee told
me with a fungi tunic on a troll/ikky (cuz the natural regen) shammy I
could probably solo pretty damn good too...

So, I'm thinking of starting a troll shammy that worships inny (so i
can get the snare necklace i have on my de cleric -- regent symbol of
inoruuk) and putting a fungi tunic on him.  Does this sound solid or
is there something I should know before dumping all this time into a
shammy over a necro?

Any opinions are appreciated.  Oh, btw druid is out of the question...
I have one in the 40s and it is booooring... evil is the only way to
go ;)
