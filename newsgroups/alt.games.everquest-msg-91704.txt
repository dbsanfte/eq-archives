The good news is that decent resist gear is pretty affordable
and/or easy to hunt for.  Sure, some of the really high-end gear
is very expensive or drops from high-end mobs, but you can
still put together a pretty good kit from "run of the mill"
stuff.

To make a good "shopping list", visit eqprices.com.
Enter your class and race, then under "Select Stats"
choose +SVM, +SVF, or +SVC (magic/fire/cold).  It's
also hand to choose SVM/SVF/SVC under "Sort By", that
way it's easy to spot the highest resist item that's
within your reach.

Finally, choose an "Item Type" to pick a particular
item slot (e.g., "Armor, Hands") and hit the Search
button.  Work your way down the list from best to worst
until you spot something that you can afford or
reasonably hunt for.
