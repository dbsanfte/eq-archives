You *do* know that only a single group can attempt the trials at a time, 
right?

And you do realize that very high DPS (that's "Damage Per Second") is 
required to succeed, along with near-perfect mana management on the part of 
all the casters in the group, right?  

Can you see how someone who can't contribute the required DPS to a group 
would have a hard time making it through the trials?

And can you see how most guilds not being able to field 5 people who can 
output the DPS required to make it through trials on their own might have a 
problem getting players/classes without an ability to generate decent DPS 
flagged?

Obviously at least some of this is escaping you.  So now the question is: 
why do you keep talking about something, when it's readily apparent you 
have no experience with it, like you know anything at all about it?
