In the real world, they are moving tokens from one account to another, 
in exchange for money. This is exactly what magic the gathering online 
does... in fact its exactly what online casino's do too. Who owns the 
casino chips... me or the casino? The casino owns the chips, but I 
'own' the idea that a certain number of them are allocated to me. Am I 
violating the casino's IP if I decide to sell my chips to a friend (or 
in actuality transfer them to a friends account)? I think not.

Magic the Gathering Online is another good case study for this. In that 
game, wizards can again rewrite/reinterpret card rules (nerf), restrict, 
or even ban the use of cards solely at their discretion. This 
dramatically affects their usability and even their cash value. They may 
also ban players accounts at their discretion. And they do recognize the 
players as legally owning the cards.

Additionally, there is some debate that if SOE did delete all your stuff 
one day, that you could in fact sue them for damages. (A case in Korea
(?) I beleive has already gone there. The US isn't obligated to follow 
their lead, but it is possible.)

Correct. Its not relevant to whether SOE would win this case against 
IGE. But its relevant insofar as it potentially highlights the 
irrelevancy of an SOE 'win'. If all IGE has to do is resume business as 
a brokerage, then the net effect is that, to all intents and purposes, 
nothing changes. Players can still buy and sell items through IGE.

But IGE isn't copying or violating their implementation of platinum. 
They're simply pushing the 'coins' around. They are simply -using- the 
coins.

It seems that you are confusing the IP in the 'software' with the IP in 
the 'coins'. I agree SOE has considerable IP in the software. However 
the actual coins are just a number in an account.

As another case study, consider the real world currency system. The 
federal government owns the IP related to the currency, the banks own 
the IP related to the software that manages it, and you actually own the 
money, and can move it around as much as you like for whatever reason 
you like, provided you don't copy the banks software, or copy the 
governments currency.

The point is, the IP in the software and the IP in the coins, are 
separate, (and in the case of real currency aren't even owned by the 
same entity). My assertion is that EQs 'currency' has no IP, its simply 
a number in an account. I agree SOE holds the IP for the software that 
moves it around. But I don't think IGE -using- it is infringment.

No, that's not my position at all.

Agreed. There is certainly room to infringe but selling tokens on its 
own, isn't infringement.

IGE is doing no different. They acquire the items through 'normal 
gameplay', as far as the SOE servers are concerned at least; they aren't 
magically getting offered all the items in the game; they have to 
acquire them.

No different from the guy who signs up to everquest who happens to have 
a friend in an uberguild, vs the other guy who doesn't. Uberguilder's 
friend could be 60th level wearing better items then I currently am, 
within a week. The other guy might be struggling to upgrade his cloth 
armour and reach level 7.

Everquest, like life, isn't inherently fair. To an extent IGE even 
balances this out. People without friends in EQ but with disposable 
income can get the same jump start people with friends in EQ can get.

You do realize that all these 'negative' effects are often perpetrated 
by regular players looking to get pp to buy something in the bazaar. I 
know people who have 'monopolized' long timed spawns for ages soley to 
sell the item in question in the bazaar, or tribute it, or whatever. 
Their negative impact on the game is not much different from IGEs.

Look into it. Its worth it, because it has taken the very opposite 
stance from EQ. Its online virtual items -are- bought and sold.

As much as I think a positive response is possible. "Wow, I don't have 
much time to play and my friends started 3 months ago, but with IGE I 
can get a jump start, and catch up to my friends." (Not saying I agree 
with the sentiment... but it exists regardless.)
