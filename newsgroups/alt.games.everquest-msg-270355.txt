Actually, what I'm suggesting is that the idea that one doesn't have
to make a choice between (mechanical) advancement and doing Things of
Note isn't necessarily the best situation.  Games are, after all,
about making choices.

Aside from your personal feelings that it's more fun that way, why?
Did you learn more writing your finals than you did studying for them?
Was it winnin a medal in the Olympics that developed the athlete's
body, or the training he did for them?

Time invested.  One might learn something, but it's miniscule compared
to what one would have learned getting to that point.  And, IME, what
one usually gains from such things is awareness of what one has
already learned and how much more there is *to* learn.

In that vein, I could see an argument that Actions of Note should
trigger level-ups but provide little (if any) of the experience needed
to qualify for a level-up.  I'll grant that it may not be good game
design, but I think it's better world design;  and when it comes to
MMORPGS I'm more interested in the ones that are more 'worldy' than
the ones that are more 'gamey.'

Feh.  You've never heard of exceeding your limits?  It's what heros
are made of.

But you learn nothing as a player, and don't have any good stories to
tell.  I'm fine with having to make that choice.
