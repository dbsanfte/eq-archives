Many thanks Martin,
    You have, at least, set my mind at ease.  I just installed the Radeon
7500 a few days ago, and had a few driver problems that I managed to sort
out.  And I was kinda worried that maybe I missed something.  But if it's an
error in the code of EQ rather than my drivers, that makes me feel a little
better.
