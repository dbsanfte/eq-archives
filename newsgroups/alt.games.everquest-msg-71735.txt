Ive recently tried DAOC & I love it!

Even at this early stage in life it crushes EQ on most fronts.

Mythic have, if you read the developers boards taken into account all of the
gripes EQ players had & reduced/eliminated them.

Early levelling is FAST. Skill choices & combat styles give players
something to think about. A player based economy & easy to learn trade
skills make that avenue feasible.

Will this game last as long as EQ? I dont know, but even if it pales after 2
years it will still be far superior to the gruelling, tedious grind that EQ
is.
