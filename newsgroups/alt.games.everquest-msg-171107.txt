Actually I think a LOT of us have that problem.  I get it BAD in 007
Nightfire as well (worse than EQ).  Its got to do with DirectX paging
I think, or video memory refresh.  I'm certainly no expert...But the
way I fix it...

In Nightfire I swap from 16-bit to 32-bit color in the Options / Video
screen...apply...back out and BLAM its back to smooth video again.

In EQ, I go to the video options window, select a lower resolution
screen...apply...accept...then go back to the original video mode.

It takes about 10 seconds to do, and in EQ it has saved my life a
couple times.  When I start getting lag in a fight I'm losing, I will
do this BEFORE I run because the lag can force you to run places you
didn't want to go.  Like in the lava in Sol.  Yes it happened to me.

For info, I have a GeForce 3 card and a 1.6 PIV (Intel).  Not the
greatest system but I slapped in 1GB of RAM...WAY more than
recommended.  Still happens.  Some kind of page refresh thing.  And
resetting the modes seems to clear the memory.

NOW!!!  Does anyone know how to set up the video mode switching in a
hotkey for EQ!!???  That would be AWESOME and a GM told me you can set
up any command in the new UI.  Just haven't the brainpower to do it
yet...

Hope that helps.

Joe
