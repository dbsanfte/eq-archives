Basically, this is only an issue if you are running a very strict firewall. 
Most firewalls (and NAT devices) allow any outgoing connection- IE as long 
as you open the pipe (IE by opening EQ and allowing it to contact servers) 
then the pipe is open. None of this is your problem.

One thing you can do is run a continuous ping from the other machine to 
your server while playing (use "ping -t eqserverblah.blah.net", I don't 
remember the names precisely) and see if the ping drops off when you do 
(likely to respond with "No route to host" or "Connection timed out"). If 
so, there is a problem with your network somewhere- a traceroute ("tracert 
eq...blah.net") should identify the problem... If the problem routinely 
occurs in the same spot, notify the officials responsible for that block... 
(you can find them at www.arin.net, assuming you live in the Americas 
somewhere- apnic.net if you are in asia or ripe.net for Europe)

I hope that helps!
