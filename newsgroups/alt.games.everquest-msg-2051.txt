I can top that...

I was passing through Oasis, and decided to solo a few Spectres
for exp.  I swim to the island, pull one, and swim back to shore
with it to fear kite it around the perimeter of the lake.

I'm kiting it around the shoreline, when I notice someone
casting spells on it.  No biggie, people often "help out" a bit,
either as a favor or as revenge on the Spectres that used
to kill them as lowbies.

I whack on the Spectre for another minute or so (it takes a
long time to melee one to death), and when it finally falls,
I get no exp...  KS'ed. 

I figure it was an accident, but it was annoying and wasted my
time and health and mana, so to let the person know that they
shouldn't overnuke when "assisting", I /ooc, "Gee <name>,
thanks for the KS..."

What I get back in response is him shouting, and I quote:
"dont pull my kills plz.  I find that annoying".
(all quotes verbatim from the log).

HIS kills?  I pulled the Spectre from the central island.
He was on the shore.  

I scrolled back, and found that as I had kited by him,
he had done a /say: "why are you pulling my specter?"

Oooookay...

The following conversation ensued:

Me: 'You mean the one that aggroed me on the island and
    followed me halfway across the zone?  Oh yeah,
    that was yours...'

Him:  'i am killing specs.'
Him:  'peoiple respect i am camping specs and not take my kills'.

Me:  'They're not ALL yours, dingbat, you're welcome to 
      whichever ones you hit FIRST, not every Spectre in
      the zone.'

Him:  'hehehe'
Him:  'if u pull near me i will take my specs.  I dont care
      if u kill them. DO NOT come to my spot and kill specs
      :> I am not hard to get along with but dont get all
      bent when u pull next to me and i kill it. :P:'

[By "his spot" he meant anywhere along the lake shore, since
fear-kiting a Spectre solo, without Snare, involves running
it practically all around the circumference of the lake where
the idiot happened to be sitting.]

Me:  'Your "spot" was on the shore, the fact that I kited
     past you doesn't make them yours.  But I'd be glad to
     petition it if you really want to be a moron about it'

Him:  'petition me :>'

[So I did, but of course the GM arrived hours later, when
the dolt was gone.  I pull another Spectre, and when I
kite around the lake past the asshole again, he says,
"<myname> i warned u"

Me:  'Warned me what, not to pull a spawn?'

Him:  'U just pulled the one i had pulled FOOL'.

Me:  'It spawned on top of me on the island while i was
     sitting, you liar.  Just how old are you, kid?'

[Apparently I wasn't the only one with this opinion,
at that point I got a tell from someone else saying,
"i know him with my main- he is ass".]

So at this point I got an inspiration.  If they were
"his" Spectres, then he must want them ALL, right?
I waited until he was busy with a Spectre of his own,
then pulled one off the island and ran up next to him,
and said, "Want this one?" and just stood there.

Note that I wasn't training him -- the Spectre was
still fully pissed off at me, and I was standing still
letting it beat on me (I've got 2000+ HP, what the hell)
so that it had no reason to aggro on anyone else,
and even if it had, I'd Fear it away as soon as it
switched its attention.  I just wanted to fluster
the jackass, AND make a point about how he couldn't
handle more than one spectre every few minutes anyway.

Which it did...  With great poetic justice, the idiot
nukes MY Spectre (either from confusion, an attempt
to KS again, or panic), and of course now it's suddenly
HIS Spectre.  Okey dokey, if he wants it that badly,
he can have it...  Now he's running around in circles
with two Spectres on him.  I sat down to enjoy the
show.

He screams, 'U FAG dont train my group'.

Me:  'That's my spectre, <idiot's_name>, don't get in
     my way'

Him:  'cut the crap u moron'

...He didn't try to KS any more of my pulls.
