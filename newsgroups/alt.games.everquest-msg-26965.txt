I was in a Free For All looting group tonight at the fort in Frontier
Mountains.  Personally, I hate this style of looting, but a friend was in
the group thus I stayed.  However, I learned an interesting thing tonight.
Auto-split sucks ... if you're a meditating caster.  It's great if you're a
tank.  When I looted tonight, I commonly got at least one platinum.  When
others looted, I rarely got even a gold piece and commonly only silver and
copper.  This sucks and is unfair.  It favors the tanks and penalizes the
casters.  When I brought this up to the tanks, they chuckled and said it
pays to be a tank.

The auto-split needs to be fixed.  If there's platinum in a loot, it should
randomly give them to group members and once a group member gets one, they
don't get another platinum coin until all group members get one and then
have the same random chance of getting that next second platinum coin.  Thus
if there's three platinum in a loot, the computer random gives one to one of
the group members then randomly gives the next one to another group member
but not the one that just received one.  The third platinum coin is randomly
given to one of the group members except the two that already have received
one platinum coin.  Same goes for gold, silver, and copper.  Now there
should also be an option for players to refuse to receive any or certain
types of coins.  Say the monk doesn't want any copper given to him.  Fine.
Doesn't improve the monk's odds of winning higher coinage but simply rules
them out of the random on the copper coins.  No one wants copper and the
computer destroys the copper that was in the loot.

Also the auto-split should pop up a window when a item is in the loot.  The
window should simply ask if they want to be in on the random for that item.
The item is shown to them with its name, stats, and weight.  Button choices
are "Want" and "Pass".  If a player doesn't choose within 30 seconds, they
will automatically be considered passing on the item.  Once all have made
their choice or the time limit runs out, the computer automatically randomly
gives it to one of the players and deposits it in their inventory.  A nice
feature would be also telling the player their current weight and weight
limit.
