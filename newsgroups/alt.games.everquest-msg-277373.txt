Well I haven't really run out of things to do, I've just acquired new time 
to do them all. There's no shortage of content yet (there are many places 
I've yet to see and I've still killed no dragons!), but I have no idea how 
long that condition will last, I'm bound to run out of content eventually. 
But I'm not there yet.
