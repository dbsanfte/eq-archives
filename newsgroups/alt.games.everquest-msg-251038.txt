I fail to see its relevancy. I'm all for easing pain, even 
pro-euthanasia to a point... but that has no bearing on whether or not 
cocaine should be on the shelves at walmart. Hell -- most legal 
perscription drugs can't be sold by the local 7-11.

And you think someone who's -prepared- to knock over 13 convience stores 
and shoot someone to get some chemicals should get those chemicals???!!!

Anyone that hooked on a chemical needs *immediate help*... not walmart 
convenience shopping.

Organized criminals are just going to pack up their guns and open 
honestly run pizzarias while smoking some newly legalized substances? Is 
that it? Its a beautiful dream, but its not terribly realistic.

This is a problem 'not connected to any crime'. You said it yourself. 
Surely you can fix/repeal such a law without legalising drugs?
