That's the fun thing about P&P (pen&paper) RPGs...if you've
got a good DM anything is possible.

The dragon could have been a hatchling, a mutant, a really bored
ancient wyrm, etc.  My RP group switched over to an EQ-type
spell-casting system a couple of years ago, where casting magic
can fatigue (and even harm you if overextended) the caster, but
the caster can contribute more overall during the games instead
of "Oh, shit...I can't "Comprehend Tongues" today because I
memorized 8 fireball spells...we'll try to talk to the giants
tomorrow morning."

It's a lot more bookkeeping, and we enforce the material components
and such, but it's a lot more fun and flexible.

After all, sometimes it's a lot more fun to "Charm" the goblin
king once you realize you don't need to "Disentigrate" his
entire retinue of 3 children and an old man to accomplish a goal.
