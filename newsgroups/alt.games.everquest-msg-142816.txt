No, I'm quick to condemn right-wing Christian extremist republicans.
That's not the same thing as condemning republicans as right-wing
Christian extremists, even if you are absurdly sensitive about the
subject.

I support of the NRA, too. But I pick where my money goes carefully,
and I believe the battle the ACLU is waging is more immediately
important (and by extension includes) the battle that the NRA is
waging.

So sayeth the shepherd, so sayeth the flock. But they're full of crap.

The judge can say anything he wants *on his time*, just like I can.
But when he's serving the public in his courtroom as an official
representative of the government, his personal beliefs cannot be
permitted to infringe on the First Amendment rights of the people he
serves. In effect, the private citizen is protected by the amendment,
but the public *office* is not.

No. But I will state emphatically that you should stop trying to put
words into my mouth, and stop being so touchy. Neither helps whatever
case you may be attempting to present.
