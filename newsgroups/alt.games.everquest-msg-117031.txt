That's true up until about level 30, or at least it was in my days before 
rampant twinking.  Hell, I was doing well with 2 Ykeshas at 35, though the 
8/24 ratio doesn't look nearly as uber now.
By the time I was level 35, I generally only got aggro if I wanted it, and 
now I can pretty much keep aggro off me, even when I'm debuffing the mob, 
resist buffing 30+ folks, mana and hp buffing 30+ folks, and doing Pally 
levels of damage.  The odd thing is that in pick-up groups I'm often the 
highest AC character, so I get to tank then, lets just say that I can keep 
aggro if I really want to.
