I'll post this since I'm surprised no one else has commented on it!

Last night, it all started after the patch which took all servers down for
about 30mins (they said it would be an hour but it wasn't)

I log back in, after about 30mins, a message in yellow text appears, then a
second one a few mins later. In guild chat we're all going 'anyone else see
that'?! (The messages said something about an ancient evil in a swamp) Just
before the first message there was a nasty lag spike, 2 of my group went LD
and one died during it :S Thanks a bunch Verant

about 30mins after the first two messages, there was another lag spike, and
two more messages, this time about war in the Qeynos Hills. Some guildies
went over to Surefall and just said it guild chat "this is awesome" The
Gnolls were marching on Surefall. Some conned yellow to a lvl 54. I quit my
group, picked up some guildies and ported us all over to Surefall. Sadly
we'd missed the action, but there were still loads of JaggedPine soldiers
and Archers etc guarding the Hills entrance to the Glade. About 150 peeps
had gone over to see (someone forgot to tell the Dark race they were
KOS....the corpses said it all :-P)

In case you're wondering the soldiers have duel fine steel swords, but I
don't know what the Archer's bows are

I've got a few screenies here:

Nice to see the continuation of the storyline in this backwater of Antonica
(which happens to be my home!)
