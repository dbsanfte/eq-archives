In the zones that a Manastone can be used in, it is equivalent on a Cleric
to approximately a Flowing Thought 100 item.  Taking into account time
wasted getting ported back to a zone it works in, and then gating back to
where you want to be afterwards...it still comes out to equivalent to
something like Flowing Thought 50.

As long as there is a single zone Manastones work in, and that zone has a
Wizard or Druid port, or a Wizard translocate, Manastones will be very
valuable.

I haven't worked out what a Manastone does for an epic Wizard...anyone know
the numbers offhand?
