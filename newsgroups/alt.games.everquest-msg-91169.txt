OK, during the fun that was the bouncing serverfest yesterday I logged on
and found myself in Emerald Jungle for some reason.  My last memory was of
fighting royals in Icewell Keep, but I had been drinking a lot of beer the
night before.  I still had a full range of buffs and full manabar, so I
concluded that I hadn't died recently, but I had a really nasty DoT/slow
on me called Ancient Breath.
I rather sheepishly asked in /guildchat if anyone knew why I had this damn
effect on me, and how to remove it.  After a while someone mentioned that
it was probably from the GM event.  I kind of scratched my head, and
asked for a bit of clarification, and they mentioned the Dragons running
around in DL.  It started to sound familiar, and then it came rushing 
back.  It seems that our faction hunt in Icewell had been going 
swimmingly, and I had been drinking a few beers to celebrate (and drown my 
sorrows after the USv.Canada hockey game) and sort of lost the plot a bit.  
Someone was in DL, saw the GM event starting, and called us there.  I'm 
not really sure what the story was, I just ran into a bunch of dragons, 
and ended up training several of them around while people killed the 
current target.  I guess a CoF and other stuff dropped, and I remember 
getting exp on at least one of the kills, but I didn't have any new loot 
on me.  Hmmm, I guess the moral is don't EQ drunk, though I didn't seem to 
suffer any ill effects.
