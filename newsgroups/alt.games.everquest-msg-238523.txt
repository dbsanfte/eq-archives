   IMHO, Bizbee can be harsh, but he is generally fair.  Of course his harshness
generally pisses off his targets to the point that it would be very hard for
then to say or even see that he is basically right, so I don't know that I could
say that his is the best way to have his insights accepted by the people he
feels the need to address in this manner.

     So I agree on the sarcasm part, am iffy on the injurious part, and in total
disagreement on the non-helpful part.  

     FWIW, if the clocks were turned back twenty years, and Bizbee were still
old enough to be above the age of consent, I would much rather have dated him
with his intelligence and honesty than some of the clingy, whiny, wishy-washy
lying trash I dated before I met Lenny.  

   Please don't panic Biz.  I'm not the stalking type.
