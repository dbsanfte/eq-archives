Shitful? Its a helluva lot better to the common player than messing
with EC. Some of the power traders who did a lot of wheeling and
dealing via trades were affected a little - but they can still do
that. Its brought alot of good items to players that may not normally
have access to before, and driven down prices on many items. Its alot
easier now to sell trade skill items and clean the crap out of your
bank. Its amazing... items that are trash will sell there. I was
suprised to sell stuff like a Staff of Writhing for 50pp. Also - you
can go in and out fast (lag notwithstanding) and not camp EC for that
item you were hoping to get. Personally - im alot richer now because
of the bazaar - and i think many can also state this.

Offline trading is not good for many reasons. First, it doesnt fit in
the RPG aspect of the game (well - thats a can of worms i know - alot
of things dont - but thats another story). It would disrupt the
balance of many servers - like FV and PvP servers i would guess.
Suddenly - youd have farmers in FV who could sell those items that are
no drop everywhere but there.
