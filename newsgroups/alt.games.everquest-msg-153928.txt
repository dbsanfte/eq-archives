Once again, it can be rather hard to channel a spell while several pissed
off mobs are beating the hell out of you. A Shadow Knight might get pummeled
by a few mobs trying to get a FD off where a Monk could click their FD
hotkey and get an instant hit-or-miss result. Feign Death has a 1.5 second
cast time while Death Peace has a 1.0 second cast. You may think those cast
times are trivial, but there have been times where I was getting beaten
around so badly I couldn't even get Harmshield off - which also has a 1.0
second cast time.

On those types of pulls, Monks are superior to Shadow Knights. Unless Monks
are reduced to the weakness of casters, I cannot see SKs replacing Monks as
pullers.
