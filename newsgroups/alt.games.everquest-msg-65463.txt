    They'd still be blue. But yeah, it's a universal tailoring complaint:
only the smallest spider-type mobs drop spiderling silks (or the Luclin
analogs).

    You haven't been looking. 8) There's Luclin analogs for spiderling
silks, spider silks, Heady Kiolas, and Bear pelts (including HQ Bear). At
present it appears anything you could make with those in Antonica can be
made in Luclin with the analogs, including ten-slot backpacks. And the HQ
pelts are dropping at about a 15% rate! Check out the recipes section on
EQTraders, and look at the regular tailoring recipes to get some idea of
what the trivial levels will be.
