<Excuse my semi-rant/semi-thanks>

When I was a young druid, of around 15 seasons, I happened to be sitting in
the EC tunnel, probably trying to sell some bone chips for spells, when
someone inspected me.  I had the uber tattered armor that I had made myself,
and was very proud of.  This completely kind soul procceeded to give me
Runed mithral bracers. Wis5, str3, I believe.  2 of them.  I was in shock.
I still have them at lvl 51.  Other items were also given to me, and I have
passed them on.  Often after a day of fighting i'll see items in my bags,
perhaps velium weapons, or gnomeskin armor and I give them to newbies,
they're like gold to them.

With my alts, I have never asked for any buffs but SOW, and I always offer a
donation, or a breeze if i happen to have my chanter.  Usually, I ONLY ask
for a sow if i'm running through Kithicor (gosh i hate running through that
place). Otherwise, I just run it as is, after all, by the time i get my sow
I could have been at my destination already.

As for ports, I don't mind giving ports for free, if i know beforehand.
Me:"/ooc Porting for donations"  goofball_01:"Will you port me to XX?" Me:
"Sure."  I port, we arrive and he/she runs off.  That ticks me off.  But if
i know i'm not going to get paid, I won't wait around expecting it, i'll
just zone in, and gate out.  No problem at all.

My alts have a helluva time getting a port tho.  It's so hard to find people
willing to port, even for a donation!  My alts are gonna have to start
offering silk swatches or something to get the porters to notice me.

But yes, I have had bad experiences.  It completely annoys me when i get a
"repeat begger".  "Can you sow, heal and regen me pls?"  Sure...as someone
said, I'll do it ONCE.  So this guy runs off and comes back at half health.
Now i'm upset.  He's gearing up..i see it, he's about to Hail me. "Hail,
Druid" and i said "NO."  He laughed and donated me some cash, i belive it
was 15pp.  You can't be mad at someone who gives you 15pp so you don't
blackball him.  I healed and sow'd him after that, but i had to laugh.  He
did not return. =).

On nights when i'm about to log, in maybe a half hour, I port myself back to
misty thicket and sit at the Rivervale entrance. "/ooc Sowing and buffing
newbies at Rivervale Entrance."  Gosh, the newbies can be so thankful.
Makes me feel good.

Hm...so i guess the result is, "You'll get buffs and items if you don't ask
for 'em," and "Don't annoy the druid!"

LOL,
Raven
