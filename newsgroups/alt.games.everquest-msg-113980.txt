For solo'ing, dire charm isn't that good.   When your pet gets low
health, you want to be able to break charm, and charm something else
to kill your former best friend.

With dire charm, you're going to be waiting about 20 minutes for that
frost giant elite to heal back to full.  Get a cleric partner, and
then you're talkin' bittness.
