I agree with Ben.  I thought I'd try out the Twilight Sea quests not long after
Luclin released.  My main is a druid and I now have several mules laden with
Twilight quest items but have yet to gather the right combo to make even one
item.  Unless you can track (or have a friend who can) and want to spend A LOT
of time waiting for the right spawn, these items are not worth it (IMHO) except
for the personal satisfaction you may get from completing the quest.

And god forbid you should need an item dropped off the Sambata Tribesmen in
Dawnshroud - i.e. Sambata Primalist !  On Vazaelle they are despawned quicker
than dragons are dropped after a patch )  Everyone loves the Rockhoppers for
some reason.
