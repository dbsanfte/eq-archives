For a long time, I left anon/roleplay off while playig my druid. I
didn't mind people requesting ports/sows etc. If I was busy, I'd reply
with a polite message saying I wasn't able to help.

However, eventually I got sick of all the idiots sending me tells
saying "I need a port" without so much as a "please". Also, I got sick
of people who wouldn't take "no" for an answer. I'd even port people,
and then have them hassle me to take them to their ultimate
destination.... often two or three zones away (which I'd happily do if
I had the time, but quite often I'd be busy, and would've taken time
out to help... and again, these people wouldn't take a polite 'no' for
an answer).

Like I said... I'm quite happy to receive polite requests for help
(I've often ported people to BB, and then taken them to the docks and
shown them where the shuttles are to get to Kunark), but dealing with
the idiots makes anon/roleplay almost essential. These days, I just
respond to nice requests that I see in /ooc.
