Well, if it's actually useful gratz to you.  The only Paladin spell

When you get 10 wins in a single theme go talk to an NPC at that camp
(the one who would have done the adventurer stone dialogue with you

only need to hail (repeatedly).  Eventually, after much blather, you'll
get your stone power-up.
