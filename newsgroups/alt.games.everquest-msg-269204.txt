Something about throwing stones in glass houses comes to mind here. I've 
long understood the term "buffbot" to refer to a second-boxxed character 
dragged along purely for buff support.

I can't say I've ever encountered an actual "bot" as you describe it in 
any game, unless you want to include a tradeskill macro or something. 
Well, I *did* macro my cleric (using EQ's own hotkey system, nothing 
external) to drop heals on my monk every minute or so as he worked his 
defense skill up once. Of course, it would only continue for five heals, 
before I would have to restart it. That said, heals aren't exactly buffs, 
IMO. /shrug

Sounds like you've got plenty already.
