I have recently installed Windows XP Home and ever since have not been able
to run windows more than just a few minutes without the system locking up.
The only thing I can find through web searches for this is either a bad
Power Supply or motherboard not being compatible. I am going to get both
this week, but was wondering what would be the best mother board for the
following components:

AMD Athlon 1 ghz processor
648 mb SDRAM
GeForce 3 Ti 500
Sound Blaster Audigy 2
Linksys Network Card
2 Western Digital Hard Drives
CDRW Drive and a Floppy

All help and advice much appreciated

Peter
