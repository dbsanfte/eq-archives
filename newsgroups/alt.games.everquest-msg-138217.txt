I was just starting to look at the same thing.
My druid is 34 too.
I have a lot less wis / mana than you.

So far I tried lightcrawlers in Dawnshrowd (because I was there)
I can take 3, but 4 gets me too many resists, and they are going lgt
blue :-(
I also tried stonegrabbers, but they were even worse :-(

On searching the web the suggestions for starting to quad seem to be :

BB Goblins (often camped)
Iceclad : Cougars / dervs / dire wolves
EW : Walrus (too many HP ?)

I have yet to see any suggestions for the moon.

So what is a good suggestion ?
Is there any easy way to find what mobs have low HP in outdoor zones ?

Options :

Marus Seru ? too low level Stone grabers too many HP ?
Grimling forest ? Grimlings ?
Twilight sea ?
Stonebrunt ? Sprites and pandas (Too many adds ?)
East Wastes ? Dervs / cougars / dire wolves / walrus (Which is best ?)
Iceclad ? Dervish / Cougars / Dire Wolves (Better or worse than EW ?)
Dawnshrowd ? Stonegrabbers / Zelniaks / shrooms / lightcrawlers ?
Scarlet Desert ? too high ?
FV ? Goblins / drachnids ? (Spells ugg)

Note that I have not tride any of these, I'm looking for comments /
warnings of don't do that !

Cheers,

Jim
