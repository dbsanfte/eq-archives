The 44th level one has a two second cast time, though. More time for a
mob to swing and inturrupt me. The 20th level one has a 1.5 second
casting time. Half a second is not much, but enough for a mob to land
a hit and possibly inturrupt me.

Even if it is only 3 seconds, that's enough time for me to get off a
root or mez. The key here is fast casting. I use my stuns spells
defensively for the most part and fast casting means less chance to be
inturrupted. (Sometimes I will stand close to casting mobs and stun
when I see them begin to cast - CHing mobs, especially. Casting time
helps here, too.)

So you prefer the faster casting root, but not the faster casting
stun?

That *is* a lot of mezzing. That's my job :). For pickup groups in KC,
AoE mez is a MUST! I'm pretty set on replacing my 4th level twenty
four second mez with my 34th seventy two second mez, though.

As for overwriting, I have confirmed that any new mez cast will
overwrite my previous mez - better or worse. If I cast my ninety six
second mez, then immediately follow it with my twenty four second mez,
the mob will wake up in twenty four seconds.

Yeah, I'm really dissatisfied casting a debuff, but I feel like I
should be doing something if not slowing :). Mobs are usually dead
before my DoT can do much, so I dont like that answer either (unless
the group is tank shy and the mob is gonna live a while). DD is a lot
of mana and slow recast time (again, in a tank shy group, or soloing,
I'll pull it out).

Based on what other people are saying, though, I may slip my Tash in
here. I'm still not convinced, but I'll experiment with it and see
what happens.

Another poster commented on berserker. I like this option. I don't
wanna part with my Blanket of Forgetfulness, but we'll see.

I almost never summon an animation. I have to get hit for them to do
anything. I try really hard not to get hit :) (for some reason,
though, I still carry around six stacks of tiny daggers...go figure
:)). Also, I like to be able to charm when the fancy strikes me. Not
have to wait for my ani to die.

Charm definitely finds it's way in to my swap slot rotation :).

Agreed. I've seen a lot of variations here already and a lot of good
information. Thanks for you post.
