hehe, I don't RP ogre much ingame, just in reciprocation to other RPers
out of respect for their way of playing. If I'd Ogred this description,
no-one would've understood anyway ):oP

Just felt a simple: 'We killed shit and got phat lewt!' was woefully
inadequate to describe the event. Nice to see that even after 2 solid
years and 150ish /played days, things can happen which still leave you
awestruck hehe

>confirmed to exist?  

*A* quest exists where you farm Sleepers for months, find a really
really rare scale drop, and hand that in to the new dragon in WW, along
with your ST key. Quest seems to stall there, and the rewards are
mediocre in the extreme. I would hope there's a long quest somewhere for
those on dragon faction to recapture the sleeper, but as yet, no clues
