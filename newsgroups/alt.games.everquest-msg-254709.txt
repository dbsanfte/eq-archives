3 locations.

Both your locations are true. There is a 3 spawn by the wizard pad that 
tends to be lower level, a 4 spawn in the SE corner by an obelisk that 
tends to be a little higher, and then in the NW corner ('by lavastorm') 
is an undead area with wanderers that is even higher level.

There are also some wanderers in the south part of the zone, but you'll 
never get anywhere on them unless you are a tracker.
