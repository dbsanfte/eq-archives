I picked up the LotR Trilogy edition of Risk... quite the twist on 
regular risk. Very cool overall... only thing I hate is trying to 
pronounce the territory names :)

I hear that. I also enjoy unwinding with HL and Quake, and UT... but I 
still like RS as a thinking FPS. :)  But I don't really need hundreds of 
targets... 10-60 is plenty... hundreds would be neat... but worth a 
subscription fee? Not to me at least...but the 'character advancement 
had some appeal...

But the last thing I want from my FPS was to be the level 16 necro in a 
game full of 65ths... unrestricted twitch FPS+PVP in a world where the 
best players also had better tougher avatars seemed counter-productive 
in terms of fun to me. That's another reason i never bothered trying it.

I'd almost rather see the reverse... like a handicap system where the 
weaker players are propped up a bit to give them a fighting chance...

But your comments make it sound like the character advancement is fairly 
incidental and not pivotal??
