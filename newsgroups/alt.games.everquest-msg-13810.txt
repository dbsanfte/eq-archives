Ahem.  You have the converse "little logical problem",
Lokari -- you're saying "I can't prove it happens only
rarely, so it's illogical of you to gripe at me for claiming that
it happens only rarely."

You either have evidence for your assertion, or you don't.
If you do, provide it (for example, give an actual statistical
breakdown of a sample of known EQ account rip-offs, and
explain how each case was verified as to method).

If you don't, admit it and stop trying to accuse *other*
people of being illogical for pointing out the fact that
you have yet provided any real supporting evidence for your
claims about how often EQ account hacks are committed with
what methods, nor are you likely to have any.  It is not
illogical to ask, "you made the claim, so how do you know
you're right?"  It is instead illogical to get testy and
take the position that it's logically impossible for you
to support your claim, so why is he bugging you to explain
why you feel your claim is supportable?"

That doesn't hold water, I'm afraid, for the following reasons:
Why would we hear about it?  How would we know if we had?
Would we even believe it?

We don't hear about the vast majority of EQ account rip-offs,
for the simple reason that most people on EQ don't use this
newsgroup, wouldn't necessarily talk about it here even
if they did, and our circle of friends within EQ is a tiny
fraction of the population on our servers, not to mention
all the other servers we don't happen to play on.

Second, how many times has Verant been told, "I've been ripped
off, and no I didn't give my password to anyone", only to
have Verant say, "yeah, right, kid, pull the other leg while
you're at it".  How many times have *you* jumped to the
same conclusion?

Speaking of the truly unprovable, it's impossible for
Verant, or us, to know which EQ account hacks are due to
actual hacking.  Hacking, most of the time, leaves no
traces that the victim can see (nor Verant verify).

So I must yet again ask:  By what crystal ball have
you determined that hacking makes up a vanishingly
small fraction of reported EQ account rip-offs?  How
could you (or anyone) know which rip-offs are which?

If you don't know, say "I don't know".

If you don't know but want to hazard an opinion,
label it as an educated guess and give your reasons for
the answer you've chosen.

But don't expect to post a flat declaration of alleged
fact without people popping up to ask you to support
it if you can, or retract it if you can't.
