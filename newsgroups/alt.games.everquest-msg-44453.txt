Morel Thule.  And its not that people aren't looking for Seb groups, its just
that they never seem to do so -in- Sebelis.  As I said, people LFG in Karnors
Castle in order to go to Sebelis  (or via tells worldwide), generally while
they do some yard trash work at the zone line or one of the moat spots.

Most of the 53+ work is indeed in Sebelis, Chardok, and Velks, which
is a pity, there really ought to be more options than that.  Personally I think
at -least- Kael Drakkar is overlooked.   Hmm, the Hole, usually some
people casually working the entrance down to the ledge there, too.

Six groups?  Not in Sebelis or Chardok, not on MT, at least not
often.  That might happen at crowded times, but its far from the norm.
Two, maybe three most of the time.  And when someone has to
leave, rare indeed would be a call for a replacement; normal practice
is to port out and split the loot.  Course the fact that there's never
anyone LFG in the zone probably contributes to that...

Crossing DL, EJ, and TT with no sow and no invis isn't trivial, while
crossing Ferrot, Innothule, and UGuk is... unless you've been fool
enough to kill live frogs, then its a bit of a nuisance.

Bergh Brelltender
wondering what it would be like to log out in Sebilis, knowing he
could log back in and find a group with ease.
