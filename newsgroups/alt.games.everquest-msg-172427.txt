Try some of the mermaids in Kedge.  Pita to get a group there and make sure
you all have an eb item or a rebreather, but well worth it if you can manage
it.

I'd say mid ot high 40's (depending upon your class and skill in said class)
and be sure to check out Phreekitty's guide on EQAtlas before you head off
for Phinegal's home.  (It will save your life at least once if not many time
over.)

for herself when it comes to Kedge)

"Shit, was that a shimmering swimming by that you just A...."
~Bard and group leader who had reminded everyone about the shimmering
sailfins at least once every 30 minutes

"Crap, Fire in the Hole!"
~Warrior who just took 400 pts of damage

"Awww man, I'm gonna have to twist Chorus and Catana now....  What part of
NO AE's do you not understand?"
~Same bard and group leader whose fingers hurt like hell after that little
event
