From the shadows, the mysterious "Thomas Houseman"
<thomashousemanHADTOPUTTHISHERETOSTOPTHESWENVIRUS@hotmail.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>Did an LDON last night in BB. Had a 49 pally with us, rest of us were 53-55.
>Got NO xp at for the 1st 10 kills even though we got the yellow XP message.
>Switched to TOTAL 100% AA points and got about 10% for the rest of the
>mission.  Petitioned it and guide escalated it to a GM before the server
>came down on us without any ingame warning.

Not a bug, typical LDoN exp.

>Needless to say, we weren't happy with not completing the mission.  Wonder
>if it will count as a failure..... haven't logged on again yet to check.
