Greetings,

This weekend, in a flash of  insanity, I decided to upgrade my machine
to  windows 2000.  I  did a  complete  re-format and  install.

Since than I can not play EQ anymore, this machine loads EQ fine, and 
allows me to play for about 10 seconds before if locks up hard. 

The music keeps on playing as if nothing is wrong, and the lights on
the DSL router keep blinking as if I am still playing.

Yet anything other than a hit on the reset button gets my machine out
of the lock.

My configuration is as follows:

   1.2 Ghz Athlon.
   640 Mb RAM.
   Soundblaster live.
   Full SCSI only (no IDE at all)
   512 kbps DSL
   ASUS - Geforce 3

This combo worked fine for windows 98, and EQ ran like a dream. I have
the latest  drivers for everything.  (went back and forth  between the
12.61 and 12.41 Nvidia drivers, but there was no difference).

But  nothing   seems  to  help.    I  switched  color   depths,  16/32
bits. Screen resolutions etc.

Every other  game I loaded (so far)  seems to run just  fine. Like Max
Payne, Anarchy Online (ignoring it's inherent problems of course).

Does anybody know anything that might make this work.?

Any Geforce 3 settings in Windows 2000 that might help?

Thanks!

Hank.
