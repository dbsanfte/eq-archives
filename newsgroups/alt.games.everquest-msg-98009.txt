I recently got my cable modem set up and have had quite a bit of trouble 
with EQ. I go LD at the drop of a hat-even while medding and nothing else 
going on around me. I hunt in Stonebrunt a lot and believe me, more times 
than not, I'm the only one out there so it's not like there's any great 
amount of action going on around me. Basically I'm just wondering if anyone 
else is having the same problems with cable modems and EQ and if they've 
solved them somehow. I did go to the EQ support page and followed their 
suggestions for cable/dsl disconnects but no dice. Any help is appreciated-
Raydeen
