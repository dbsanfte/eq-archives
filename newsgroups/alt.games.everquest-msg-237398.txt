Yeah, well, people are easily influenced.  Everyone thinks their religion
is the one true religion because that's what they were brainwashed to
believe.

Every time an American Christian tries to convince me Christianity and
Jesus are the truth, I remind them that if we were born in Saudi Arabia,
he/she would be trying to convince me Islam and Allah are the truth.

Alas, it rarely does any good to bring attention to that fact.
