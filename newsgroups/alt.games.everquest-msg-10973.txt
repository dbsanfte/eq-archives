A word to the wise (and you)...don't go throwing stones around when your
name, email address, campus and home phone numbers and addresses, as
well as Employment information are so readily available via the web. If
you are, in fact, who you say you are, you might want to be a little
more careful as to who you take pot shots at. No, I am not going to post
any of your information, I never had any intention of doing so (although
posting information that is already on a website is hardly illegal). You
just might want be a little better about picking your battles.
