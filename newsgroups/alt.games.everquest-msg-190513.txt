Sheer growth rate of the logs would be an issue here.  You'd probably 
need something lower level and with more fine tuned memory handling than 
PHP to keep up.  Also, I don't think they store logs in flat text files.  
I'd be willing to bet they're kept in a database with a few fields 
indexed so the GMs can search on 'em without taking the hours that a flat 
text search would take.  select * from karana_transaction_logs where 
charname='Meerina' and item='a bloody protector of zek''s head'.  1 row 
returned (369.2 seconds).  GM_01 tells Meerina: 'Yeah, it looks like you 
deleted it back in January.'

Adding average price of an item as a field in the items table probably 
wouldn't be much of a technical issue (figure 4 bytes per record), but 
it's easy to inflate stuff like that (200 bat wings priced at 1sp and 1 
priced at 1Bpp = average price of just under 500kpp).  This is why I 
don't pay much attention to pricing guides on websites.  Also, what 
determines the average price of something?  And how often does this 
average get updated?

See human element arguments others have made.
GM_00 tells Plat_Buyer00: 'did you buy the plat that Plat_Seller00 just 
gave to you outside the game?'
Plat_Buyer00 tells GM_00: 'No, he's just a friend of mine.'
GM_00 tells Plat_Buyer00: 'Okay, just checking! :D'

And if you think they log everything everybody says (and hears, since 
they'd have to use that to determine proximity) I'm *sure* you have 
another thing coming.  If they did, /report wouldn't have to be 
implemented, because they could just check logs.

Short versions: "infeasible without large upfront cost" and "probably a 
waste of time anyway."  If somebody wants to buy a ton of plat with real 
money, I don't really care.  Is it keeping stuff inflated?  Probably.  
Would I be able to afford that stuff anyway, even if the inflation 
supported by this activity were removed?  Probably not.
