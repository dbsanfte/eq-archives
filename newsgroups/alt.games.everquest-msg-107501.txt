Well.. does not the nexus scion actually tells you NOT to sit inside the
spires if you dont intend to go to luclin.. But hmm.. you would not get that
message if you did not hail the scion.. and you dont hail the scion unless
you want the shard to travel.. so.. nevermind..

Anyway.. it is not 100% broken all the time.. i was sitting right outside
(or that was what i though) the spires in odus, waiting for a friend, when i
got the message saying something like "You do not have the necessary
component to travel to luclin" when the spires kicked off..
I was sure i was sitting outside the pilars, but you should really sit AWAY
from them if you really dont wanna risk getting caught up in the transport..
