Hi Again;

I've played many online games over the years, but, EQ has been the hardest
so far for me to "get a grasp" on all the subtleties and combinations of
grouping coupled with the millions of places to play that have to be handled
different. I swore I would never pay $9.95 a month for a game 4 years or so
ago when EQ first came out. Now I'm paying $12.95 a month, hehehe..go
figure.  I guess I'm getting a little old (56) to be doing this, but, I'm
sure having fun, and for the most part, meeting really great people.

Thanks all for your time and suggestions. I've written these down to help me
when I wind up in a group that is clueless.
