Well, they don't really have any way to tell who is playing the character
from the same household.  For all they know you live in a shack and haven't
spoken to a live human being in the flesh in 2 years. For all they know,
you are the van pattens, and 8 really isn't enough.

Equally valid reason would be to get the second account to be able to use
one to powerlevel the other.
