There are a couple of zones where dc pets are quite nice.
kael guards arnt bad... they double for 169.
North TOV has pets that hit for 220's
Best zone ive seen so far is POAir, where if you equip them they quad for 
300's. Pity is such crap for xping.
Trouble with pets in these zones is you really need to pay attention, a 
wandering pet can get everyone killed so easily.

Its handy to have max extended buffs and 1 level of hastened MGB. That way 
you can keep vallons up without a second chanter.
yeah, its probably not as important as the others.
