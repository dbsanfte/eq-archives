Ah, yes.  The criticism of the small details, while ignoring the absolutely
amazing fact of creation itself.  Also know and the petty argument.  When
the argument winds down to this, it's a good indicatoin that there's nothing
left on the anti-God side, save sour grapes.  I'm truely sorry (no, honest)
that the small details of the human form aren't to your liking perhaps you
could fix the problems yourself.  We weren't designed to be perfect,
otherwise we would be gods ourselves.

Again, what would it take to satisfy you?  Looking at this "watch" it's
obvious that alot of care and work went into us, yet you say it was "thrown
together."  I'm sorry that you can't... no, won't be pleased.  In the end,
though, you've shown how shallow your argument is.
