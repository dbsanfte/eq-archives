For my next excursion into twinkdom, I'm looking at making a
chanter.  I've played mainly priest classes, with a sprinkling of
melee, hybrid, and of course a bard; my experience with pure
casters is limited to a mage to 29 a couple years ago (was still
in raw silk at 29, too, and proud of it), and a necro to 22 or
so, again predating focus items and such.

At any rate, without blowing more than a couple Kpp, I'd like
some suggestions as to gear, as well as any thoughts on race and
stats.  My guess is Dark Elf or Gnome, two races I haven't played
with much at all, but if there are considerations similar to the
Regent Symbol of Innorruuk that some other race features, I can
look that way too.  As for stats, well, Stamina hasn't turned out
to be as important as I'd thought, it seems to have quite small
effect on hp.

Gear wise, I figure to go with a set of focus items (focus I or
II will be fine, be quite a while before hitting 49 and needing
to upgrade) and then cheap HP gear, relying on my native int to
provide sufficient mana pool.  Sound like a plan?
