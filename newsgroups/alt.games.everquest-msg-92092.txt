In my experience, startup guilds are ten a penny and rarely last beyond a 
couple of months. She could join, it may work, but it is probably a better 
bet to find a guild that does have a website and email list and stuff 
already, as least they look a bit more committed...

Try checking through http://eq.guildmagic.com and finding a guild with 
members around the same level, then check out their websites etc, find one 
you like, contact some of them in game and enquire about joining. If they 
just let you in without wanting to group with you first or anything, run a 
mile, since they obviously aren't very discriminating and thus are probably 
full of the sort of idiots who live in Oasis and LoIO.
