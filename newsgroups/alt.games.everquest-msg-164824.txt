  I play on Test, from time to time when I just want some peace and
quiet.  But my, how quiet it was!  None of the serverwide channels work
there.  I have serverwide.age:age on autojoin, and ever time I went on
Test, I was the only one in the channel.

   So you can imagine my surprise when I logged into Test last night,
and saw that there were 10 people in the room.  I didn't see any
chatter, though, so I sorta held my breath and sent out a /1 Can anyone
see me here on Test?  To my delight, they could, and I could see them as
well. Though it seems odd to me that Test was left out at all.  I mean,
presumably they tested the serverwide chat first? (Waits for the
laughter to die down)  (Still waiting)    (Taps foot and looks at
watch)  Ahem.  Well, I know that Test is a different sort of animal than
the rest of servers, and I thought it was in a sense it's own stand
along game, if one considers the other servers to be grouped together. 
In the sense that you get to pick one of them from the list that
contains all of them, while Test stands alone in the server list when
you log onto Testside.  Ok... I know I'm not making any sense now. 
Anyways, I'm glad they let Test join the rest of the universe in this
regard.

 I'm going to enjoy playing on Test more now.  I mean, up till now I
would have missed it when someone up a link for "Gloves of the Damned
Dirty Pot Smoker" (three links run together, really, but I didn't
realize that at first).

Annie <--- Also glad that she's not yet guilded on Test, so not able to
confuse /gu and /1 there.
