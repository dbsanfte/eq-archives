Aye - I know the same spot myself. I often hunt around there and have had to
ask people not to do it when they don't have the camp to themselves as it
completely messes up the AI. They tend to aggro the entire camp and some
mobs are stuck around in "limbo" - some wander back, then others appear to
"lemming" of a nearby cliff and reappear heck knows where.

I actually /petitioned on fellow who refused to stop doing it when the camp
was shared amongs quite a few different soloers due to the unexpected adds
from his pulls.

I have no issue with someone risking their own account exploiting on their
own, but when it affects other people I draw the line.
