A return to the spawn point gives a chance to memwipe and a healthy boost 
to that chance(and the memwipe chance for FD). This is why we Monks 
frequently wait for a mob to path home before standing and bringing in his 
buddy.

If you stay on his hate list(which is more likely, naturally, when you 
don't have two or more chances to get off the list) he will come back at 
you when you are within his reaggro range, which is a very large area.

The big danger is wanderers of mob types that cooperate- they never go home 
and never wipe, while spreading your name to any ally they see. Even Monks 
are screwed here, because our fairly small chance of a memwipe with FD is 
the only wipe we can hope for, and frequently results in a flopping monk.

The other possibility is that the one that hated you despawned and one that 
did not popped.
