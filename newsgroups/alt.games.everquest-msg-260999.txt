As you said, you can turn them off. It's not as much a problem of
whether you have a high end system or not, as much as if you video
card and it's drivers deal with them well. Some people will have no
problems what so ever with the new shadows. Some people will see them
as just more clutter to turn off. Just be content to turn them off,
and no harsh on everyone elseï¿½s buzz.
