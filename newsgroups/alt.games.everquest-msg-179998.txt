Hi,

I think thats a joke, isnt it ?

This is a roleplaying game where you should slip into the role of being
someone else .... I dont think you have that big feet (halfling), that kind
of ears (elves) ect ... It is a fantasyworld, so why should you make the
char looking like you do ? There are plenty of different races in game ...

What next ? Possibility to scan your face and put it on your char ?
Including RL-religions ?

The whole game is fiction, thats why I love it =) And there are no racial
issues between the players at all which would start as soon as they would
include "realworld" races (I think I can hear the whining about "why my race
is a minority here too ..., ah discrimination ....").

Leave the game like it is, its a fictionworld everyone should have fun in
... the look is not that important ...

Christian
