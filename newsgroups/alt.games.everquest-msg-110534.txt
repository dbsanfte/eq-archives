Cheap and emotional, yes, but a logical extension of "updating the
database". After all, you can't have a universal agreement until you
purge or replace the ones who disagree.

You don't like when I describe ideas with rough words and concepts?
When I show the ugly side of them? Good, that's the point. They *can*
be seen that way, and *will* be seen that way by the people they
affect. Why? Because morals, definitions of "good" and "evil", are
*not* universal.

It was a third-level quote, and only there to maintain the thread.
You'll note I quoted it entirely in the previous message.

Do you always avoid addressing points by attacking the quoting style?

I wrote: "There is no single human society - there are countless
societies, all ever-mingling, changing, and rearranging."

In Message-ID: <3cc70e3a.33476415@news2.newscene.com> you replied
"There most certainly is a single human society."

You said it. Now, prove it.


>And "ganged up"?  You are claiming Germany as a *victim* here?

From their point of view, certainly.

We're not talking about any lofty actions here - several countries
joined together for the sole act of committing *extreme violence*
against Germany, because Germany was a threat. From the perspective of
the Allies, crushing Germany was the correct action to take. We don't
have to play with pretty words to dress up our actions; it was a
battle for survival, us or them. Call it what it was - we ganged up on
them.

Fair enough, religious observations withdrawn.

We're in agreement that morality is a human invention. It does *not*
follow that the majority morals are "right". The only thing that a
majority determines is whose ass gets kicked the hardest.

Tell it to the citizens of Hiroshima.
