Yes, that's what I was asking.  In the original post, it was just a venting
of steam.  Again, should have cooled down and then worded my quest for
knowledge differently.  Should have also not replied in kind to the initial
posters that flamed back in defense of Verant.

I tried a Google search on the topic but didn't come up with anything and
then posted my venting ... and then got flamed ... and then flamed back ...
and ... and now I'm going to let the flames burn by themselves and not stoke
them anymore.  I'll reply to this line of the thread, but will let the
others die out.

In a way it does.  I didn't know they were working under a deadline and made
their originally set goal.  That seems to be rather rare in the gaming
industry.  Most release dates keep getting set back further and further.
