One thing I have noticed is that when the raft zones, Belly is leaving
the dock. So, I usually zone with SoW up, and as soon as the raft
zones in, I jump of, levetate, then run forward. Since I have started
this, I run smack into the Bloated Belly just before it turns. This
cut 20 minutes out of the trip to Overthere! 

Of course you need SoW and Levitate to do this. I have done it with a
fellow traveller as well, but it was close. I wpould bet that trying 3
would miss the boat. Once it turns, you ain't catching it!
