True.. interesting. But, it would certainly require you to optimize
every moment of time you have online to get the most out of it. The
main problem is grouping... people usually have to spend an hour just
tracking down, getting, and taking a group to an area where they then
get experience. Wouldn't this slant the power towards say 3-box'rs who
could just hop into the xp area and go? It would certainly slant
towards hardcore raiders that overcrank on mobs. Most casual players
like to kill stuff casually too.

How much time are we talking a month? say 6 hours per weeknight.. 12
hours on weekend days? that would be roughtly 216 hours if i have my
math right. Or do we make the requirements tighter? Either way, I
think it would have the inverse effect and make the 'high end game'
much faster to compensate.

I just don't think that would change in your system.

They do make interesting test cases for expanding the procedures
though.

Everyone says that.. the withdrawls prevent it :P. We should have a
detox for EQ playing. :>
