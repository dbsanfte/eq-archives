Who uses evac on a raid?  I've only ever seen people evac from single group
situations.  On a raid, in almost every case, it is better to camp out a
Cleric, and get someone to FD to tell when it is clear for the Cleric to
come back and res.  One of our FD'ers is usually a Necro, so even if none of
the Clerics get camped, the Necro can res a Cleric.

Evacing, best case (i.e., the leaders call for evac before anyone has died),
means the raid essentially starts over, so all the time you spent getting in
and getting spawns broken and stuff becomes wasted.  In the more realistic
case, the leaders would not call for evac until people have started going
down, and then you end up with a similar situation to the best case, except
now you've got corpse recovery for some people, and some of your people are
naked, so you either spend a bunch of plat summoning corpses, or have the
Monks and Rogues spend a bunch of time dragging them, just to get back to
the point of starting the raid over.
