As someone else stated, you won't get to see all the
sights -- all the sights that you might see while you
sit and camp spawns during non-PL play :^)

PLing just helps reduce the time you have to spend 
camping, for example, the Orc camp in EC.  Instead of
fighting the Orcs for a day or two, you can cut it down
to a more reasonable couple of hours.

Thus, PLing might actually help you see more sights
now that I think about it...

P.S.  This is NOT a flame to either PL believers or
PL haters!!!  Just my opinion...
