    I don't know a single "rich" cleric. I do know several impovershed ones,
and many that have below average bank accounts/twinks. Beyond folks who get
lucky on rolls, the richest classes are the ones that can farm solo. Clerics
have no efficient method of dealing damage (no DoTs, no pets, no melee), and
therefore make poor farmers. Add to that the normal costs of adventuring
(Symbols), which at many levels are NOT reimbursed, and the fact that we are
expected to sit in place (so low chances of looting), and you have a poor
class.
