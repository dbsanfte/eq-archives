Then you've never seen him before he's been bugged.  I've tried it, 
several times.  If he's not bugged, I am completely unable to get by him, 
at maximum possible travel speed, invis or vis, right side or left.  I've 
watched people try.  I've never seen anyone succeed.
When he is bugged he will not move.  When he is not bugged he will move, 
and he will aggro anyone trying to get past him.  (Well, anyone not on 
correct faction.)  The harmony trick works by having a druid/ranger cast 
harmony 10-12 times in a row on him.  At some point he gets bugged and 
unable to move, and then anyone can run past him.
Go there right after he spawns and try it.  If your server is anything 
like Innoruuk, you can sit there and watch the first zerg-guild treehugger 
come up and chain-cast harmony, then have someone else test it.
