You will be hurting when you realise how rare that enchanter epic mob is!!!

Firstly, don't pull Wraith with the Amy's, they an attack it and they will
easily kill it (bu-bye epic)

You had the right idea, maybe not the right positioning though (you weren't
really clear about where you pulled to)

When were doing PoF we generally pull to 2 spots, the bunker and the finger
house.  Both of these are far enough out of the way that you don't get
accidental agro issues.

Use a necro or SK to take all the HT's, and then get the amy's kited.  Have
a druid meet the necro/sk along the way and get them all snared and kite.
Pull them to the raid in small managble numbers.
