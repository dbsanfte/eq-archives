    How does anyone know how many gems the cleric used, given that some of
the level 60s I meet these days don't know the reagent cost of Naltron's
Mark or Aegolism, or even know when I'm using Naltron's Mark versus another
Symbol? (Yes, I know. They're sad.) More importantly, who wants to keep
track of these things, especially in a group where players may come and go
frequently over the course of the night? "Ok, Bob the warrior is leaving.
Let's tally our cash totals, and could casters please submit bills
normalized to minimum greed merchants at max CHA?" It's tough to even get
groups to master loot, let alone figure out what a cleric has REALLY spent.

    Systems like the one you encountered are used by players for whom four
44 pp gems are chump change and who don't want to spend all night thinking
about these things. Hand gems to cleric, happy cleric, me no think so happy
me, yay!

>gems that sell to vendors for 44p each...just because he's a cleric.

    And I sure wish that's how it worked on my server, BTW. 8)

>Does that sound fair to you?

    "Fair" and "loot" NEVER mean the same thing to two people. I, a cleric,
am in a pickup group. Where we are, nothing I'd use on my cleric drops - but
some items I would put on my rogue. A main-char rogue is also there, and
rogue gear drops which he would use. Does it default to the rogue? Am I ever
entitled to a roll as long as someone who will use the item in question is
there, or does time spent in the group count? That last part came up a long
time ago, when a shady guild on my server used NBG against a Nec Guard group
by rotating warriors into the group. As soon as a Lammy or CSS dropped and
their warrior claimed it, citing "need", their warrior had to go and a new
warrior from their guild showed up to replace him (group leader from the
same guild) - a warrior who also "needed" a Lammy/CSS. Loot rules are never
"fair" to everyone.
