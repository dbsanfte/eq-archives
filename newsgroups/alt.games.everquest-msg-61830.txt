Those NPCs are on "Kaladim Citizens" faction, and are not a good 
indication of how you'll /con to Dwarves in general. My DE Necro is either 
indifferent or apprehensive to the OOT/BB Dock dwarves, but very KoS to 
the guards.

There's an NPC on the shoreline in Butcherblock to the left of the OOT 
boat dock (when facing away from the boat) that will give you a more 
accurate /con with Dwarves.
