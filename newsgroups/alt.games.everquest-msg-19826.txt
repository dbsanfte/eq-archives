Well, I didn't mean that this *particular* message showed up
everywhere, but I have yet to hang out in any type of newsgroup
for a while which wasn't eventually visited by the racist yahoos
(not to mention any other sort of yahoo you'd care to name).

This sort of fanatic just broadcasts their stuff to every
possible audience they can manage to reach, so there's very
little selectivity in their targeting.  I highly doubt they
go after gamer groups via any sort of thought process.

Check the cross-post list for these types of messages
sometime, most often it's either a giant block of
alphabetically consecutive newsgroups, or some obviously
randomly-selected sampling of the total newsgroup universe.

If some newsgroups seem a bit more immune, it may be because
they're the special-interest newsgroups that aren't propagated
quite as widely as some others, and thus may not show up on
the nutbars' lists when they sit down to spam every newsgroup
known to them (i.e., that is carried on their own particular
news server).
