How long does it take for a same server tarnsfer?
Any comments on the process?

I recently purchased a new RoK and SoV cd for a <third> account to run as a
utility account (The wife and I already have our own individual accounts).
We plan on making a duird to port our two primary characters around (Cleric
and Enchanter) and I was considering splitting my warrior off to that
account since he is high enough in level to tank for me  :).
