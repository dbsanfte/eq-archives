Well I figured out how to solo orc centurians, slow but I can do them.
Made 6 and some of the way to 7 tonight. Is orc hill where the orc
camp is? Or is it kinda overlooking it? I use hide and when a lone orc
comes by I use the bow to get its attention and then go melee. Died a
few times but got a bunch too.

Still not good at grouping. I tried again tonight and we didn't do too
well got acouple orcs but partner had to run. My fault for not keeping
them off him, he was a caster. But I'll tell you what, it gets damn
confusing with every body running around. I tried to save him but went
down under a hail of blows, it was fun though.
