	Suffice to say convincing a group to go to any such place would be 
largely impossible, while the rewards for turning up to a raid and 
exhibiting four hours of robotic obedience would be far, far greater. 
(possible cause and effect there)

	Perhaps the fault was with my guild, but I doubt it. The system is 
pretty limited. So are the raids.

	Yeah, good thing I left before such 'challenges'.

	I liked being a shadowknight (when it worked). If I wanted to play as 
an Orc, surrounded by people without a clue how to play their actual 
class, I'd have gone over to WoW ;)

	Not sure this is justification for the infinite continuation of this 
structure? Just because it has always been so, it must be so... Glad the 
rest of humanity never thought so - I'm not much good at catching fish 
with my hands.

	I think the central message of 2nd generation MMORPGs is that being 
flexible in the face of overwhelming and unanimous complaint is the 
short road to giving players whatever they want and removing any real 
challenge to the game.

	Vanguard will probably be great because they're actually introducing 
new kinds of challenge (such as non-moronic AI) and expanding on the 
original concept of MMO's, rather than simply implementing what players 
think they want on top of the oldest set of ideas available.
