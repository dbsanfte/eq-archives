All of my friends say the only way you can play Everquest beyond level
29 is to buy plat from Yantis at www.mysupersales.com or his other
site www.playerauctions.com

According to them, he sells millions of plat every day on every
server. They say he gets his plat from a corrupt GM on the EQ system.
I was reading on playerauctions that Yantis has an unlimited supply of
plat available. That's why the bazaar economy is so bad that a regular
player like me will never be able to buy anything nice. I don't have
the money to buy plat from Yantis. Oh well, I guess it's time to move
on to another game where they don't have corrupt GMs. Hopefully, I'll
be able to talk my friends into joining me.
