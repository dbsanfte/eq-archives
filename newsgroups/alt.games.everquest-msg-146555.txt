Except that at 54 (the start of the target "complaint" window of 54 to
56)
you now get the UHOF, which is a better pet DoT than the shaman
pet of the same level range.  As a back up tank it sucks completely,
but as an added damage producer, its certainly there for you, unless
the group is going after light blues... On light blues you'll have to
adopt some new tactics to get the pet to become persistant, which is
what
I've been doing in SF with a group, have that pet lasting as long as 8
mobs
in a row.
