Sounds very similar to the bug they claimed they fixed a long time ago.  It
was especially noticeable in Qeynos Hills, but affected other zones too.  It
happened to me (and others) all the time when fighting wandering gnolls.  You
could be fighting them up near blackburrow, say, and they'd pop back to the
path in front of the North Qeynos zone.  The only difference was that their
hate list didn't get wiped.  Usually they came charging back at me a few
minutes later once they regenerated enough hp.

Definitely /bug it.  I wonder if the problem has resurfaced in other zones
too... I haven't hunted in QH in a long time ;)
