As a knight I'm used to helping others.
A little disappointed that a  majority of you think that epics are all I'm
interested in. Perhaps an internal reflection.
The only reason that all of my characters are not level 60 is that I have
been running a guild, that means "a lot of work helping others"
One of my criterion is again  (1) a guild with enough high level characters
to help with epics
                                           (2)  a guild with a mixture of
guild grouping "hint implies helping here" and Raiding (Hint implies raid
helping here" app 50/50
                                           (3) I have enough  'bonafides'
and recommendations to satisfy anyone
