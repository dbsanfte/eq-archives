One thing that I haven't seen anyone mention is that Morden Rasp probably
has a bazaar channel.  On Brell is is auction on Fennin it was market.  So
try /join bazaar and /join market and see if there is anyone else in those
channels, or ask around and see if perhaps it has another name.  On Brell
there is usually 100+ people in bazaar looking to buy or sell.  You might
get some ideas for gear there.
