It does make sense.

You might be surprised. I know some Time lvl people that don't have
41% haste yet and it's definitely not the norm for the tanks I know
outside of raid guilds. Admittedly, the time level people w/o decent
haste haven't been raiding for very long. 

The froggie king really wasn't that difficult once you figure out a
good plan of attack.  We took him down with 4 people (Shaman, druid,
monk, paladin) and only the monk has 2 or 3 pieces of VT/elemental
gear. The rest of us are basically in bazaar gear or stuff that's
single groupable. 

I'm not trying to argue here but for the benefit of any lurkers I
thought I'd point out that the fabled mobs aren't _that_ difficult for
a decent group w/o uber gear. Even the dino in OOT wasn't that
difficult for our 6 person group and he hits for 2k, rampages and
enrages. Don't forget that these mobs are still the old lvl (around
50) so they tend not to hit too well. 

Rgds, Frank
