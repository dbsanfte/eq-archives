Great idea, but i can't see that happening as it would be easily
exploitable.  Take this scenario for example.  Dave's Wizard is his main.
He downloads EQW and creates another character (or more) to group with... so
we may have for instance a level 58 wizard grouped with 5 lvl 1 characters.
Wizard now gets the damage bonus and goes about his normal soloing routine.
The 5 lvl 1's would not suck any exp at all.

If it was made so that the levels had to be more comparable, the wizard
could always disband before the final nuke and still get the benefit.

I think this idea would be great if alot of precautions were in place to
prevent exploitation.  However i doubt verant would goto the trouble
