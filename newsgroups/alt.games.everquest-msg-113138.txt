Go to a website, and print off a list of what level things become trivial
at. You will want to practice things that ar just below the trivial level...
to get the most training for your money. Start off with silver+malachite,
which becomes trivial at 14

If you enchant the metal (you are an enchanter arnt you?), you will get
slightly more when you sell the jewelry.
