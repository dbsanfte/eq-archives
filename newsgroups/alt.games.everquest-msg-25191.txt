Sounds to me (and it appears others agree) that he dropped this bag on the
ground in hopes to find it when he logged on with his alt he was trying to
twink.

What I find surprising is that these level 50's+ (which includes myself,
which is why I find it hard to believe as my friends list cannot hold all my
friends that I have in game) don't have FRIENDS that can do a transfer for
them.  It couldn't possibly be any worse than just dropping it on the ground
(seeing that PC's -and- NPC's are known to pick up those large looking sacks
on the ground).  Even if you do not trust a "friend" to do this for you,
should you make CLEAR the trade agreements (in this case a TRANSFER) stating
what items are being traded and who the intended receiver is (your alt),
then issuing the /report on both yourself and your "friend" afterward,
should he/she not return the items, you can issue a /petition.
You -will- be protected so long as those above guidelines are followed and
will receive the items back.  I have seen this done on two occassions.  Keep
in mind I recently left the guide program, so, who knows... maybe its clear
cut that GM's (not guides or Seniors) cannot reimburse any items even if
this is done now, but it wasnt when I left.

Wow, that was a run on. :)  The only thing that sorta erks me is the fact
that should you receive an item when your inventory is full, it will simply
drop to the ground.  <shrug>
