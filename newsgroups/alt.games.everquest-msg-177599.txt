If you back off, you lose the proximity component of the agro.  If one of
the tanks is already on the hate list, the mob will be hitting him anyway,
not the cleric while DA/DB are up, so the cleric backs off (not runs around
madly), thus removing the proximity component of the agro for when DA/DB
drops.  If a taunting melee person is unable to get to the top of the hate
list during that time, then, there is the possibility of the mob running
after the cleric, but, that should be pretty unlikely.  Of course, I could
be completely wrong about DA/DB and the hate list, in which case I am sure
someone will be happy to correct me.
