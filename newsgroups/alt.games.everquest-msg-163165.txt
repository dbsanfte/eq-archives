I've been stopped at 115 just because it will cost me 50 to 150 pp per
attempt just to get to skill level of 155.  That is making high quality
rings.  Since the change in smithing (you use to be able to get to 176+
making banded) It's been made more difficult to get to grand master unless
you have a lot of money and time to sink into it.  I would subject finding a
DE that is a grand master to make it for you.  IMO....


PS: If someone knows a better way other then making HQ rings to up from 115
+ please let me know.
