Ok the difference is that the 6th member does not increase the number of 
kills per min you need to get the same xp. So effectivly there is no reason  
to not invite *anyone at all* 

Here is how it works old-school and new-stylie :

chars xpold   xpnew   mobsold  mobsnew   %Imp
1     1000    1000    1        1          0%
2     510     600     1.96     1.67      18%
3     353.3   466.7   2.83     2.14      32%
4     280     400     3.57     2.5       43%
5     232     360     4.31     2.78      55%
6     200     360     5        2.78      80%



So aside from getting more xp the difference is that now a group of six 
need to only kill the same amount as a group of 5 or the same amount as a 
group of 3 used to have to :-P

Nicer.

Not sure if that answers your question but its good info
