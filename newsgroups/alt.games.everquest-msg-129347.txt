By this reasoning, the Pali's can do anything due to the fact that it was
their homeland?

Sai, you are proving to be a troll, an ill informed running off at the mouth
troll who hasn't read anything dealing with the issue.
How far back do you want to take this?

Israel being formed in 1947 from Palastine?
The state of Israel formed by Moses after leaving the Pharoahs? When he came
over the hill and found someone else living in the land of "milk and honey"
called the Philistines...(hmm palastine, philistine....nah...) 1250 BC c
Or when Abraham left Sumur and formed his sect in the area? 3000 BC c?

Actually it is a very well recieved organization internationally, and is
usually thrown to the dogs by whatever nation is being accused by the Abuse
du jour.

CNN doesn't give a damn about anything anymore. Its all about the ratings
after Time-Warner bought in.

Well, she pointed you to several sites, and you won't read them. Which makes
you just as hard headed as everyone involved. And tell me, oh seaman of the
high seas, you ever read anything about the subject or are you just
regurgitating what you hear?

And tell me, if Israels way of retaliation is so wonderful why hasn't it
worked?

From every indication that I have read...When Pali stops, Shin bet (you know
them right?) comes out and kills leaders of Hamas, Al Fatah and PDLF. While
understanding the tactic, they cannot assume that everyone will then believe
their propaganda that pali's started it all over again.
