    I almost think that channeling is only checked if you move the caster
from their original position. Since melee has a knockback to it, usually the
target has to check.

    And if you want embarassing channeling, a buddy was running a raid in
the basement of Sebilis during the Kunark era. 18 people were pounding on a
mushroom man that had CHeal, and the mushroom was able to get off CHeal on
itself six times in a row.
