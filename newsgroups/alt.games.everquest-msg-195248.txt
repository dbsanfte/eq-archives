    And you miss my point. All the boosts you want in power are available in
the game. The ones for melees are permanent - once you have it, you keep it
until you upgrade (except the DS potion). Your caster friends have to keep
running back to the local enchanter to get powered up. Once you get what you
need, you have it better than them.

    And "insane ratios" is very relative. The best rogue piercer in the
original game was 8/27. I can get a piercer with the same ratio off trash in
Netherbian Lair. It takes almost no effort to have vastly better gear than
the designers of the original world ever intended a melee to have. You will
own the content there accordingly.

    Last time I checked the FBSS was going for 2 K. To put that in
perspective, that's 200 silk swatches with the going prices on my server.
Can you farm spiders? Then you can get an FBSS. Weapons with insane ratios?
Lamentation, 2 K. Jade Mace, 2 K. Those weapons deal 50% more damage than
the top weapons of the original world. Laugh as you wander from place to
place, owning low level stuff that was never intended to see such weapons.

    Bandages aren't good enough healing? You can have an AC that puts the
top old-world tanks to shame, and HPs coming out your ears. You're only at
50% health when you start to fight? Big deal, at 50% you have 90% of the HPs
of an old-world melee of twice your level! Get in trouble? Lucky thing you
can buy SoW potions and never be caught by an outdoors mob again! The only
thing holding you back is time. Are you willing to spend the two weeks of
farming silks and leather paddings, and scouring likely vendors (PoK is a
godsend for this) to get the cash to buy these items, or would two weeks
without levelling totally break you?

    Why are you sitting to 100%? My warrior, at level 42, had Crafted for
armour, a Jarsath Trident and one of those 13/25 swords from Chardok for
weapons, and Silver Chitin Handwraps for haste (so about the same haste as
FBSS). She could tear through blues like the zelniaks in Dawnshroud, only
stopping to bandage to max possible between kills. You do know that once you
bandage to 50%, you can remove all your +HP gear and bandage higher than 50%
once you put the +HP gear back on, right?

    This has been the case since day one. Being jealous of that will not
change it. If you want that ability, then make one of those characters and
go do that. Just be ready to see the price you will pay for all that solo
power.

    That's a bug, and one I wouldn't mind seeing go away. But when it does,
look where it leaves those spellcasters. They have the same basic damage
output as they did in the original game, since low level spells haven't
really gone up in DMG/mana since original game. The best increase over that
base damage available to a caster would depend on class: 1.2/0.75 = 60%
increase for a DoT caster (Extended Affliction and Affliction Efficiency),
1.2/0.9 = 33% increase for a nuker (max damage on Improved Damage and Mana
Preservation). To compare, a melee with FBSS haste and a pair of Centi
Shortsword-level weapons is going to have a 45% increase in DPS over the
dual Yak melee with FBSS haste from the original game. Centi Shortswords go
for 200 pp each on my server.
