This happens to me from time to time, too.  I was helping my wife get her
druid that last sliver of exp before level 29 in LOIO.  She'd died a couple
times to a bad group, and was feeling frustrated, so it was in my own
self-interest to help her rather than listen to her grumble about it all
night long.  Anyway...

This soloing wizard comes walking up.  I drop a clarity on him.  He thanks
me and goes running off.  A few minutes later, he comes running back, damn
near dead, with a mob on his tail, yelling for help.  I blow it up.  He
thanks me and runs off.

A few minutes later, after my wife had healed him and he ran off again, he
comes running back, mob on him, almost dead, yelling for help.

This time I mezzed the mob and told him he had 96 seconds before the mez
wore off.

The way I look at it, he asked for help, and I saved his life.  He also
didn't pull that stunt again.
