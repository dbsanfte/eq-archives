I would make NPC porters in most cities that require payment for
teleportation.

Newbies and young adventurers (who, theoretically, couldn't afford
the ports) could marvel at, and discover, the world around them,
as they travel from place to place.

Oldbies and ubahs (who, theoretically, could afford the ports) who
no longer marvel at the trip from point A to point B could get
their teleport.

Wizards and Druids could still make a few pp by charging less than
the NPC porters, as well as helping out young guildmates that can't
afford the NPC porters.

However, SOE isn't stupid.  They know _a lot_ of people will buy
PoP as a way to port themselves, just as _a lot_ of people bought
Luclin so they could travel more easily and buy/sell in the bazaar.

SOE should just start charging money for in-game items and abilities
and get it over with.
