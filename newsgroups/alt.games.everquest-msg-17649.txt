I recently began a dark elf necromancer and though hes still a low level ive
noticed a few things while playing this class. For a start, even at level one
he is able to summon a pet to melle for him, locate his corpse and shield
himself as well as tap life. The necromancer is a power house! I can be jumped
by 3 mobs, at blue/white and hand them all their asses (something my ranger,
warrior or paladin could never do), with the help of my trusty pet.On more than
one occasion ive been knocked unconscious, sat back and waited for the
inevitable only to find the feisty little necro jumping back to his feet
(killing the mob after this rules : /rude at a skeletons corpse (repeat as
desired) hehe) I dont seem to take as much damage as i thought a caster would
and can hold my own with the melee. Every extra level seems to offer great new
spells and as the necro is no hybrid he levels quickly. Also, blacks and
yellows can be taken down without much risk so the exp is thick and fast. I
know the necro is KOS in alot of places but is this his only weakness? or does
he become less potent at higher levels? And what about grouping? are his skills
much in demand, as i say im only a low level but im having immense fun playing
this class. The race/class combination is of high difficulty but so far ive
walked it so im curious as to when the difficulty will kick in and how? The
fear spell is also available at level four! and though its great i am a little
hesitant about using it because if i do the mob bolts and im left chasing him
down and only getting the odd swipe in, should it best be used in conjunction
with a snare or root? the casting time is too long to cast mid combat.
When i started this charcter i decided to leave neriak and seek to raise
faction with the freeport milita, but after learning what a necro is capable of
i can only stay true to his race and though i will be KOS for a long, long
time. The day will come when....Muhahaha...they will be KOS and i will wade in
wasting human scum left right and centre.
