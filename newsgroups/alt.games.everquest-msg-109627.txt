Doesn't work, the patcher only plays the game if its there files. If
their files are not there they are downloaded. Linux has no direct X 8
full screen 3d game capability at the moment (even in emulation), that
is why EQ can't be played on it.

They have the emulator now, but it does nothing. This is the problem.
It has taken verant 1000's of man hours and full time employees and
over 7 years now to get EQ to the point it is at today. So even if
this were possible, to make your own EQ with the existing art and
flesh out the world would take nearly the same amount of time. Of
course, you'd not have tons of full time employees to do it (if you
tried to you'd get in severe legal trouble, plus how would you pay
them anyway?)

Voila

I've seen open source graphical mud projects in the linux community,
yuck. Open source is fine for some programs or simple GUI's, but for a
graphical good game it equals = suck ass. The reason why that is,
anyone good enough to make such a thing right is already working at
game companies for money. This is part of the reason why open source
does not work well for entertainment products like games.

Besides all this, EQ now has severaly dated limitations which make it
impossible to change many aspects of it without it being better to
just rebuild the entire game. Essentially what you are suggesting
would take about 18 years as an open source project, in people's spare
time, to make a very old mmorpg which was horribly outdated by then.
Meanwhile, verant has announced EQ2 which is a totally new engine and
game from the ground up coming out in the fall of 2003.

"After the commands are in, any mud coder should be able to add
just about anything to client and server."

Ahaha.. not. They could if it was a text mud. Mud programming is a far
far cry from graphical mmorpg programming. Most players of muds can
eventually learn to script a new zone, most players of a graphical
mmorpg could not eventually learn to do a damn thing in it.
