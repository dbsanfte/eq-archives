The poor old beast is getting worn out.

Last spring, my spring tuneup, I was told that one of the carb
adjusters was seized.  This fall, my winter tuneup, another one froze
in place.  Now, I can't get properly tuned for summer or winter.

Until I get a new engine, or a whole new bike, I'm gonna have to give
up any riding below -10, unless it's just short distances such as to
the store, when it won't have time to cool off again.

Drat.
