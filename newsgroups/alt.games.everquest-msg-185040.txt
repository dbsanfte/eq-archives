"like I'm expected to do"

Have you *ever* postulated *anything* substantive?

I've always figured you were just here to argue.  The *only* things you can
point to that are substantive (yes, we've had this very same discussion
before) are related to newbies.  I don't even know if you do that anymore,
as I'm not sure I'm qualified to speak on such topics anymore and generally
don't even read those threads.

And I know this may be tough for you to comprehend, but I only insulted
*your* intelligence.  There was no "our" there.  :p
