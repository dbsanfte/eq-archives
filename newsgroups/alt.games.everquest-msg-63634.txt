Hey!  Bizbee did something helpful.  Blatantly helpful.  Take note, all 
those who say Bizbee only whines and slanders, and never contributes.  So 
there!

}As it turns out, I guess that the reason that I (and many other
}people) never got the skins folder, Win32bitmap.dll, and the other
}files was because we did not have Internet Explorer 5.5 installed
}on the system.
}From what I can tell, the new patcher MUST have Internet Explorer
}5.5 on the system in order to work.  Otherwise it is unable to patch
}itself, and therefore it could not download the new folder data and
}the files.

What an odd assertion.  When I install windows, the first thing I do is 
remove any trace of the evil and insidious accompanying browser and 
install netscape.  And the patch program works just fine for me...
