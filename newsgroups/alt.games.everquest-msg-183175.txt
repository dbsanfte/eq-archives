Hi

I have a problem and i hope someone might have had a similar
problem pop up.A patch or two ago my scroll wheel stopped
working which was not a major problem just annoying,but now
i cant use the shift+up arrow to recall anything i have typed before
which is really annoying.Does anyone have a suggestion or a fix
for both problems.
I'm running winxp on a pretty high end machine and i have all of
the expansion.

Thanks
