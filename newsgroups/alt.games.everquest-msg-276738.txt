This reminded me of a D&D campaign I played in years ago.  The PCs got
recruited by a goddess for a quest.  (Aside: Turned out the goddess
had her own agenda and was just using us; we should've guessed, since
she was Chaotic Neutral, as was the GM. :-)  As part of the setup, we
were given several thousand gold each and turned loose in a bazaar
where ALL non-artifacts in the dungeonmaster's guide were available at
list price, plus several one-of-a-kind items the GM rolled up at random.
We got to equip ourselves with whatever equipment we thought was best,
up to the price limit that had been set.

First thing that happened in the adventure, we were sailing to our
destination and fell into a magical sleep.  We awoke to find all of
our gear (magical and otherwise) had been stolen.  Over the course of
the adventure we did manage to recover most of it, but only by
defeating the NPCs who were using it all against us!
