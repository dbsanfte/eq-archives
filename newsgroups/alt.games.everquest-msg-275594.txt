After years of delay, I am very interested in playing EverQuest.

When EQ just started years ago my friends tried hard to convince me to play.
That time I was into Baldur's gate series. There were so many great single
players RPG available those days. I have been playing Diablo series,
Plainscape torment, fallout, Wizardry 8, Icewind Dale, Dungeon Sage,
Neverwinter night series Morrowind.so on.
And never played MORPG.
These days I don't see RPG that interest me so I want to join EQ world.
I read EQ player's guide and interested in dark elf necromancer, Halfling
cleric and half elf bard.
Since I am not very out going person, I maybe more comfortable playing solo
I think.
But I hard it is almost impossible to play solo. I still want to try solo as
far as I could go.
So what is the most capable character to solo?
Any advice to newbe?
Any tips choosing server? (I have no idea how to chose server)
Any advice is appreciated.
