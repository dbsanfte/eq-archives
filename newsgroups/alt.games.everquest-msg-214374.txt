Log on with LDoN enabled and zone in to POK and you get a message
telling you to go to your home town, or if you've blown faction
there, to WK or RM.  Went to Akanon where I got another message,
to seek out some guy in a tower west of the Forge of Defiance.
Course the LOY map doessn't list place names, I wander around for
a while before digging out an old map which shows them; one
problem, there -is- no tower west of the forge!  Look around some
more, finally am about to log out and get a tracker to come hunt
up the name when another gnome pops in to zone and says (clearly
divining that I have no clue where to go) "near the bank".  Well
one problem, I never learned that zone really, bank in POK is
easier to get to, only reason to venture anywhere in AkAnon for
me is the mage guild.  But thats ok, the other gnome is heading
for the guy anyway, I follow him.  Turns out its East of the
forge, not west, and there was another clue, the voice mentioned
that the guy was looking for brewing supplies, if I was a trade
skiller that would have helped, cause he was in there with the
brewing merchants.

Then he  runs thru a series of messages with a couple clues in
it, and tells me to go talk to one of a series of names, with no
clue where they might be.

Fortunately I have insider information at this point, so I know
one is near the GFay line in BB.  Gate to POK, down to Felwithe
and run to BB, down the road and there's the camp with lots of
new NPC's and quite a few players hanging about.  Go thru another
series of responses, where I need to reply with the clues I was
given, and I get an adventurer's stone.

Its an augmentation that goes on charm slot items and gets better
as I learn more about the wayfarers.  Course I have no charms...
nor do 99% of people under 60 I'll wager.  But there are charm
items available on the vendors, so if I earn points in LDoN I
guess I can remedy that, and thus have a place to put the
augmentation.

In the meantime, apparantly its also what you need to go in to
LDoN zones.

Didn't see many people looking for groupmates, or for groups,
around that camp or the Everfrost one (there's a magus at each
camp who will send you to any of the others for the asking)

Logged out, going to bed

Splendid
