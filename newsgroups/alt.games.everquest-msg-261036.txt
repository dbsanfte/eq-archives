I've long suspected it might have to do with those insignificant, 
unraisable factions that we've all gotten used to ignoring.  Like 
Battalion of Marr.  Rydda'Darr came right for me, at the back of the pack, 
despite my 295 Cha and general inoffensiveness.  But I'd ground out quite 
a few AAs in HoH, and this was my 4th or 5th RD kill, so I just might have 
had a lower faction than most there.

The really fun part, though, was that I lived long enough for the tank to 
aggro it off me.  Go Go Eldritch Rune! :)
