I bought an IBM Thinkpad recently for playing EQ both while I am travelling
as well as playing a 2nd character on a 2nd account simultaneously.
After shipping costs, I spent about $1950. It uses an ATI Rage Mobility
video adapter. It works fine, but it is a bit slower that my desktop system,
despite the fact it has a much faster CPU that my desktop system. I could
have spent a little more and got more video memory, but for my needs, it is
fine.
