Because they're the closest in haste percentages.  WR is *still* the fastest
haste spell in the game.

VoG actually doesn't *quite* get you to the haste cap at 60, even with a 41
percent haste item.  I haven't yet parsed to see if the haste cap goes up
over 60, but if it does the extra speed of SoV (and WR) would definitely
make a difference.

It will stay this way forever.  It was done *specifically* to stop SoV from
stacking with monk epic.

VoG = 58% haste
58 + 35 = 93
58 + 41 = 99

Haste cap at 60 = 100%

Perhaps you define "totally effective" differently than I do.  :)

I still ask for VoG at times, for the added ATK and the ability to use my
epic as a dispel blocker.  But I don't kid myself about what tradeoff I'm
making.
