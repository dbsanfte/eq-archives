If this has been posted, my appologies, though my news proggy has no posts
like this showing at this time.

Try this:

In Windows Explorer (not IE) delete all files beginning with   greatdivide
in your EQ directory, then re-run the patch.

In DOS (I prefer the difficult ways still) go into your EQ directory and
type   del greatdivide*.*  then ENTER and then re-run the patch.

I know you stated that another character can zone there just fine, but, to
be honest, its the only recommendation of any kind that I know to make.
Plus, it couldn't hurt, atleast your GD files will be fresh. :)
