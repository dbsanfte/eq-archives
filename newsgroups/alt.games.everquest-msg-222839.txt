Bah, I actually can't believe I let myself get suckered into this debate. 
It always ends the same and no ones mind is ever changed, at least not 
immediately anyway.

Bottom line, I use Windows. It works fine for my purposes. I'm in IT and 
am able to work around or defeat most of its shortcomings with little 
effort. I don't expect perfection, but it comes close enough to keep me 
happy. The only market leader syndrome aspect I would *really* like to 
see eliminated is the freaking high price.

All due respect to you and your own opinions.
