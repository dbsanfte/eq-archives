Excuse me? Last I checked, I was paying for this service, not being
paid. I've done QA professionally, I don't need to do it in my private
life. If Sony stops charging me, then sure, I will give them free QA
work, until then, I am paying for a service and have every right to
complain if it sucks. Not that I have much to complain about, I am very
happy, but even so, who are you to tell me I have no RIGHT to complain
because I don't play test?
