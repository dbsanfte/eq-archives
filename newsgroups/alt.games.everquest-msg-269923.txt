And your suspicion would be wrong. The max you can get your
natural skill is 250, as I said. The tradeskill AAs do not
effect that level, it only effects the chances of a success
on a combine (i.e., you will still only have a skill of 250 or
252 with geerlok but the AA's will raise your chances of success.))

You may *need* to get your pottery to 300. You are not able to.
