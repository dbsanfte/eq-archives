try the G persons post above mine or also try checking if you have texture
caching on (options screen at login) toggle it off load up the game and see
if that fixed it first, if not try the download.. happens to me alot with
various diff graphics going nuts and that usually fixes it (i could prob
avoid the problem altogether if I'd stop using caching but my comp has mega
hd space and always seems low on memory so speeds things up for me to use
it)
