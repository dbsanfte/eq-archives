If you stand around a corner from an AE-casting mob, it's an exploit... 
obviously a geometry bug.

If you put a charisma buff up before KEI before fighting a mob with an AE
that will take *either* a charisma buff or KEI, whichever it finds first,
it's an exploit...  obviously a spell stacking bug.

Wait...  those are strategies.  Nevermind, seems that some things in this
game that seem very "exploity" are in fact well used strategies.
