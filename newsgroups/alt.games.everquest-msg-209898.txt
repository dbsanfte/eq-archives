Up-side? There are two: Jack and shit. Seriously. A "red" on a "blue
server" can only attack other reds, which are almost nonexistent. The
down side is you cannot be buffed, healed, or rezzed except by other
reds, which again runs into the same dilemma of the scarcity of people
to attack. You can group with blues, yes, but they cannot heal you. In
fact, I don't think a red can heal/buff/rez blues, either, but I'm not
sure. This would mean that you're almost worthless to groups if your
class isn't a pure tank/dps character.
