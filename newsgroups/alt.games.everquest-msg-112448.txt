I started getting problems like that after I installed an Epson
printer.  Their "printer status" utilities, which are automatically
loaded when you boot, interfere with EQ somehow.

After I nuked the software before running EQ, (Ctrl-alt-del to
bring up Task Manager, then highlight the app and hit "End Task"),
EQ ran fine again.

My nephew had a similar problem with a different "continuously running"
app he had recently installed on his computer.

The first thing you should do is try to remember if you installed
new software around the time you started having the problem.  In
any case, try using the Task Manager to nuke *all* tasks that are
running, other than Explorer (which is the Windows user interface)
and Systray before you run EQ.  If that cures your problem, you can
then reboot and start selectively nuking tasks until you learn
which one(s) are the problem.

Note:  If you're running Windows 2k/NT, you may also need
to hunt down non-essential tasks in the Processes tab of
Task Manager, but that's a trickier proposition because
essential parts of the operating system also show up there
and it's hard to tell what's Windows, and what's third-party
software.

If running EQ with only Explorer and Systray still doesn't cure
the problem, then you'll know that the problem is something else
entirely.

That has been pretty much fixed, in my experience.
