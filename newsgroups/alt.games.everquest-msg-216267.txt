To aggro and pathing?  Name just one.  Just one.  Go ahead...

Yeah, and after you get some experience you realize what causes it and it's
just another feature of the hallway.

Actually, my guild is also known as the guild that accomplishes the most
with the least.  Our *first* takedown of RZtW was done with *less* than a
full raid.

But then, we do expect people to play smart as well as all out.  I'm
unfamiliar with this lazy and timid play style you are espousing.

I'm not, thus the subject line.  :P

It would indeed.  And if they play smart (and without being timid), they
can probably pull it out just fine.

*I*, as a monk, can continue to tank and wait for CH to hit if virtue drops.

Now, if you want to postulate that virtue drops, the cleric goes LD, the
paladin and enchanter are *both* OOM, the ranger/druid/shaman has forgotten
how to root, and the wizard decides that it would be better to tank than to
nuke or root park...

Yeah, kei dropping sucks, especially as I've done more adventures without an
enchanter now than I've done with one.  But it's not that one missing CH
that the cleric is gonna be worried about.  :P

So you gave up and waited til it started running?  Bright.

Everything I've put in this thread has been LDoN specific.  Again, check the
subject.  If I mentioned something outside of LDoN, I probably specified
that it was outside of LDoN, though I can't think of anything but a response
to someone suggesting the magician would be a better puller if they had sow
and nobody else did, to which I mentioned that *everybody* has sow if they
want it these days, and to which...  hey, that was *you* that thinks
magicians get an indoor sow...

But of course.  30% should be fine.  :)  Though when I'm 2-boxing the cleric
I'll go ahead and go at 20% or even lower because I *can* regulate mana if
I need to.

And what if I told you I was describing a total pickup group where I was
playing my 51 ranger and the lowest person in the group?

I generally won't claim to know much under-50 anymore.  The game has changed
considerably since I was legitimately under-50 with any character.  But
yeah, I do consider 50+ to be *the* game, and 65 is the end I enjoy the
most.  :)

Pleased?  As long as you do your job we're fine.  I imagine you'll be
pleased when we win.

/pet back off is zonewide.  That doesn't change anything.  The pet *still*
took off, even if you immediately backed it off (assuming you *aren't*
pulling from the far side of a dungeon).  And assuming you want to use the
pet as a doorstop, you haven't turned off pet taunt.  And assuming you
haven't turned off pet taunt...  well, you'd just have to play a magician a
while to understand how that all works.

...  ok...  so in other words, you didn't actually have a point here.

Yes indeed.  And feel free to bitch about how low your mana is while I pull
us to a quick and easy win.  :)
