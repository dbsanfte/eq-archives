I did.  I used to have to change gamma when I switched between
Human and infra-capablef characters, and avoided "desert" zones
like the plague with my Humans because I had to have the gamma
cranked way up.  After the change I was able to find a single
comfortable gamma setting that worked ok for all my characters,
tho I find a greater lightsource to be a great help in certain
zones regardless of the toon I'm driving.
