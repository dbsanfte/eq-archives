Druids got stuff that looked a lot like what I had on Cel when she was
originally level 30ish, with the addition of a level1 focus effect
here and there. Polished bone bracers, gatorscale leggings, velium
etched stone mace, jasper jewelry, black iron medallion, testament of
vanear. Bad pieces imo were leather boots and a BCP lookalike for a
tunic.
