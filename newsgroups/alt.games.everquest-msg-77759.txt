Err, no.  The stat boost occurs whenever stat food is the next to
be eaten in your inventory.   Eat normal food until you're full and
put stat food before any other in your inventory and you'll see
the stat bonus.   As you've noted, actually eating the food doesn't
cause the stat increase;  having it first in your inventory does.
