Hiha - had EXACTLY this problem. Verant gave their usual excuses, i
tracked it down eventually to be problem with my connection type. I
only had this problem with a V90 modem, use a K56 and all was fine.

Unfortunately i dont know if that helps in your case - if you are
using a V90 try and find out if you can give it some dial up commands
to force it to connect in K56

Hope this helps
