Um, I'd avoid DL at that level, it would be rather fatal.

HHK is still semi popular, still sucks too from what I hear.

It's been a long time since I did much at that level too, I'm sure there 
must be a dungeon somewhere with undead mobs at that level range, but I'm 
too lazy to look them up.  Befallen maybe?  Guk?  Runnyeye has a nice xp 
modifier (no undead), and I managed to solo my warrior in there in the high 
20s down on the 3rd floor or so.
