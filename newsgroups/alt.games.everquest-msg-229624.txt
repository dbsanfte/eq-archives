He could also be getting in easy kills while looking for a harder target.
Sit around doing /who tracking movements of people near his level, while
picking off any lowbies that come in sight.

A 20 level range sounds too high, though, although a lot depends on how the
PK points curve works.  Compare to XP hunting...ever wonder why greens don't
give XP?  At first, it might seem OK to not have a cutoff, and if someone
wants to kill a ton of easy mobs, let them, but if you do the math, it turns
out you could level a lot easier on low greens if they didn't have the
cutoff.  I remember calculating my XP/minute around level 45 as a Wizard,
fighting medium blues, and working out that if there were no cutoff I could
have done better fighting mobs of around level 15.  A level 15 mob would
only give about 1/7th the XP of a level 40 mob, but I would have been able
to kill way more than 7 times as many per hour (just nuking one at a
time).  I bet a similar thing happens with PK points.

There are some interesting ways this server *could* go with that large a
limit, although the population might not be high enough for some of them.
For instance, one outcome that would probably work well for the high level
players would be for high levels (by which I mean 20+) to stake out
territories around the newbie areas, and spend their time slaughting any
6-ish people that come into their territory, while looking for opportunities
to take out one of the neighboring high levels and expand into their
territory.  While waiting for newbies to come out and die, negotiate
alliances with other high levels to take out the people that seem to be
getting too powerful.  Any lowbie that gets out and is able to level up
could then come back and try to muscle their way in and get some territory
to do their own lowbie farming.  Newbies might have to band together and
rush one of the high levels, so that some can get through.  This could be
quite fun.
