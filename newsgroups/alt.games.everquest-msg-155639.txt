No need to slap the heal on the pet, really, unless he gets SERIOUSLY
damaged... His natural regen tends to be fast enough that, by the time
you've finished the fight you're in, pulled the next mob, and are
damaged enough that you need to back out, he's back to full or close
to it... The pet usually doesn't take more than 1-2 bubbles of damage
throughout the course of any "normal" fight I'm in.

One thing I have noticed, though... Playing "pet cleric", you can take
on tougher mobs, however, the fight is MUCH longer and more
mana-intensive. My killrate pet co-tanking is probably 3/4 or better
as fast as my druid's quad-kiting. Seriously.
