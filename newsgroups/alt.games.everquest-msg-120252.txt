DT.  Calm down.  I was joking.  And the "licking thier ass" comment we
meant to illustrate that cats are NOT 'classier' than dogs.  :-)

And for the record, I have owned several cats.  Loved all of them.  I
just find myself more of a dog person.

This, is untrue.  You beat a dog, you end up with a mean dog that WILL
turn on you one day.  There are pounds full of 'mean' dogs that have
turned on their asshole masters. 

As a slightly more light-hearted example of cat's lack of
intelligence, I put forth as and example and old cat of mine that
INSISTED on continually attacking our cow, even after being kicked
several times.
