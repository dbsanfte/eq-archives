It let's me kill it in the task manager, so no hard boot needed for me.  
I'll be optimistic and assume that a few reboots and the Detonator drivers 
they recommend fix it.  Now, I have to find time to play.  They almost have 
me sucked into buying SOL just for the travel options.  They sure do know 
us well.

What's the final time on the auto-port: 15 or 45 minutes?  I've read both.
