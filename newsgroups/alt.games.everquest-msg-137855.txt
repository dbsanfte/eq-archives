Ah k.. well theres lots of ways around that.  Shrink, grow.. ogres..
positioning :)

Isnt there some key needed for him/his room?   greigs is a zone I avoided
like the plague since a week after luclin went live...   green mobs
rampaging, the wizard dieing instantly at the zoneline, NO mobs, NO agro, NO
dt.. haha no thx

Maybe its time to change now tho.. looking on a map, I see (i think) the
spot of 2 named mobs..  these aren't raid encounters right?   Or at least
multi group encounters?  Im debating taking a group up there (well me and
another person), and trying anything thats up other than greig.     The dps
would be extremely high, but all healing/slowing would be coming from bots.
Not that bots matters, thats what we do on every other raid :p

Id rather not fight TiV ever again.  Him and THO have the most screwed up
loot tables now, they are reminiscent of something in ST post-awakening!
