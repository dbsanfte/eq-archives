If you are careful, you can solo at 22 in Overthere.  

I generally bind way up on the wall.  Hide and Camo are both really 
useful.  Watch for the Sarnaks, even the green ones will kill you
dead.  

All the creatures are very magically resistant.   Many of them can
bash/stun.

No, wait!  You really shouldn't go to Overthere ever.  Another prime
exp fishing spot blown.
