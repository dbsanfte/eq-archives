Ah, harmony the best reason to group with a druid outside while trying to
break a camp.
Harmony is an area effect spell, used to reduce the aggro radius of a MOB to
next to nothing.  Example usage would be in Everfrost, I can target Redwind
cast harmony on him and then single pull one of his icy orcs (the ones
closest to me).  If it does get resisted (never had it happen yet) it will
not cause aggro to you (enchanter lull spell does).

note:  make sure the MOB you are pulling does not walk through a harmonized
MOB, or else you may aggro that one too.
