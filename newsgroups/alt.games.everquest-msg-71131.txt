A couple trips to the Arena should get your faction to dubious, but it
isn't something you can do solo.

No. Wuoshi sees through camo/invis, and she spawns at the dragon
circle. If Wuoshi is up you're dead.

Get someone to port there first and check if she's up. If not, getting
the WL spells is a piece of cake.

At 56 wyverns are greening out. I started quadding otters at 56. With
226 wisdom and 328 in mana items I had to medkite at least 1-2 times
to get the kill. If you have a lumi staff it'll be easier.

Hunting in CS would be very difficult if your CoV faction isn't at
least dubious.

I've heard Velks is the best 50+ xp in the game. I found it too
crowded for my taste.
