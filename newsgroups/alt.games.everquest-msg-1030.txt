I largely agree with most of your post, but here ... no.

I play almost exclusively solo, grouping only rarely. (a ranger to boot,
playing part-time, so my advancement is slow) I was well aware of "group
bias" going into the game and was prepared for it when I started playing
last spring. I've no complaints, etc., etc. I have no intention of beginning
to regularly group, and even if I had, my time would no permit lengthy
grouping sessions. I intend to play into my 50s as a mostly-solo character,
and as long as I get to see more of the land as I advance, I'll enjoy every
minute.

Now, to your question. Why "the fuck" am I playing a massive multiplayer
online game? Well, duh.

Because it makes the world a living, breathing place with real "people" to
know, recognize, interact with, etc.? Because I *can* group when I want to,
and having the option is a damn nice thing? Because help is always there
when I need it? Because actual human beings can give me information on
people, places and things instead of NPCs with computer generated text?

And most importantly: I play RPGs because I like escaping to and exploring
their worlds, and NOTHING makes a world more vibrant and real than one with
a few thousands actual people running around it doing their own thing, each
with personalities all their own and stories to tell, each that I can
converse with at will and interact with as if they are real, because THEY
ARE, all combining to make a lifelike and interesting place to escape to for
a few hours a week.

That's why.

Massively multiplayer means we are all playing the same game at the same
time. It doesn't mean we are playing it together.
