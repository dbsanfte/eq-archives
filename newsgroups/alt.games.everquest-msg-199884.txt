Umm, cite for this?  Every other single person I've spoken to says
that unless you have ALL the flags (which would include the minis)
then you remain very much unflagged.

My personal experience tallies with this: I killed Terris a bunch of
times before doing a Hedge run but remained resolutely unflagged to
get *into* her zone even though I had the flag from killing her.

Seer is missing tons of information and what she does have is
convoluted.
