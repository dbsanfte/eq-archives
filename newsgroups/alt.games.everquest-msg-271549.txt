*shrug* Analogies are always suspect, but they can help get a point
across to a willing listener.  I don't think the examples I've used
are particularly idiotic.  I will, however, admit that using words
like "idiotic", "moronic" and "asinine" in my arguments probably
wasn't a very clever approach to seeking out willing listeners.
Next time I'll put the nicotine patch on at least an hour before
posting.  :-p

You do touch on a key issue I was overlooking.  The steep power
ramp-up throughout the levels in most level-based games tends to
make a mockery of the contributions of lower level characters in a
group.  The idea I'm doing such a poor job of articulating probably
won't ever work very well in such a game.

Likewise, Lance reminds us of the generous level range allowed for
groups in EQ1, and that makes for an interesting example.  There
are plenty of mobs that a level 60 can comfortably solo that would
quickly wipe a full group of level 45s, and yet that level 60 can
group for experience all the way down with level 40s.  So, as Lance
points out, EQ1 apparently makes significant allowance for what I
was aiming at already.  Unfortunately, it does so in a way that
that usually trivializes challenges for the lower level characters.

It may well be that there is no way to create the environment I'm
imagining in a game with a steep player power-up curve.  Which, in
turn, may well mean that there is no chance in hell of ever seeing
it in a commercially viable game.  But I'm not ready to abandon the
idea yet, I'm tired of endless repetition of the same-old, same-old
in the games we play and I can't shake the feeling that there is a
real opportunity to make things more interesting that can grow out
of this.
