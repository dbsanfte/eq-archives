I've seen several people mention this, and they are wrong (assuming
post-50 here). It's somewhat difficult for the ranger to NOT draw
aggro unless its a sk or paladin in the group, or the MA is grossly
better equipped, without pointlessly stopping their attack.

The trick isn't to never get aggro, which unnecessarily limits the
ranger's dps, but to get rid of it fast when they do get it (jolt
works fine). Rangers aren't so wimpy that they fall down dead after
the first two hits. 

Also, archery isn't a viable alternative to melee damage until 55 or
so. Even now using BFT and summoned arrows I am not really coming
close to my melee output unless I use trueshot. Archery only becomes a
true replacement in regular group play after you start getting the
Archery Mastery AA skills.
