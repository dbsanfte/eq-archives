Heh. Really, my problem isn't so much as someone referring to
themselves as "Drow", but when they try to pass off that all DE's in
the game are "Drow". Then try to argue you into the ground about how
"they're obviously the same thing!" when you try to "educate" them.
Invariably, they'll shift it to "It's my character, I'll RP him
however the fuck I want!" when they've run out of real rebuttals.
