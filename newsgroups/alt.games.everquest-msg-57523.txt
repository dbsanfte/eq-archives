 What and have it brought to everyone attention that this mighty 'GM'
was caught with their pants down. Sorry the GM was way out of line
there. They were just being the proverbal 'poor loser'. A complaint
should be made to Sony\Everquest\Verant about this 'power tripping
wuss of a GM'.

 BTW it was a DAMN GREAT planned out and executed attack. It
was a guild war wasn't it?!?
