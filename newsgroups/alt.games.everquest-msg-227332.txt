I'd argue that it's usually better not to stop at a zone line to warn
people. Especially if you have sow (or any kind of a speed advantage
over the mobs), you can usually gain enough distance to zone well
before the mobs get to the zone-line which means they'll turn around
without ever getting close enough to agro whoever is sitting at zone.
If you stop to type something like "train incoming", you'll usually
give the train enough time to catch up with you and everyone else at
the zone line.
