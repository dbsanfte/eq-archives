It may have been hypothetical, but it was a pretty stupid hypothetical
situation to set up.  I personally agree that the druid should have informed
the person that he was being ported to BBM, but if I were in the situation
you described, I would take the first port I could find, and run the rest of
the way, because I would be far more likely to arrive at the raid site
sooner if I took the BBM port and ran to Gfay than if I waited for a wizard
to answer my port request.  I have been ported by a wizard twice in the
entire time I have played the game as a result of offering to pay for a
port, I have been ported by druids countless times.  There are a lot more
druids in game than wizards.  I don't have any port capable characters, I
also never beg for a port, I offer to pay for ports, I ask in guild if
anyone is available to port me, if I can't get a port, I hoof it.
