That is exactly what I was saying.  As you lower the clip plain ( shorten
your visual range ) you ar making it so it has to draw a shorter area.  It
is still drawing things you cant see, just not the ones all the way out.  I
run the bazaar with my Clip plain set at 10% or less.  Hopefuly when they
get the new graphics engine working, this won't be something that I HAVE to
do, rather than something that i do to make it just a tad faster.

Next time you are in a rade in a dungen, and are watching the lag bar.  Drop
your CP till the wals just start to grey ( can still see detail, but it is
foged ) and see how much better the lag is.  IT is amazing howmuch that
unseen stuff efects the game.
