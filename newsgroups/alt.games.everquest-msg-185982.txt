Quit whining.  It's not a long way to travel.  If you had to run from
Freeport to Qeynos to get to a book, I could understand.  Have you
ever made that run on foot without a SoW?

Hell, I thought the Nexus was a blessing when they implemented that. 
Compared to travelling on foot or being lucky enough to come across a
porting druid, I'll take a 15 minute wait to get to the Nexus anyday. 
I used to think that the Nexus made travelling a hell of a lot easier
until the Planes of Power came out.
