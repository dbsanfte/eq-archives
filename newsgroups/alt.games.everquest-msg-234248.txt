Ok I have it on a few chars. AFAIK or can tell it has a chance to cast
Mirror 1 on YOU thus any NPC casting a spell on you has a 10% (or so I
says) chance that it will be reflected back to them. However it has to
happen in combat (attack has to be on), then it has to activated for
it to work in the first place - it will take up a buff slot so if you
have none available it won't work. Have seen it activate many times,
but only seen it reflect once or twice in LDon for my monk while
pulling some mobs. Is it worth it? Well since my ALT have it and have
seen it work yes for them, for my 65 druid not really.
