To put a new carrot out to drive expansion sales, and aa grinding. If 
they give it to you on a platter, its a missed opportunity to create a 
time sink with a reward... of course.

I disagree. The 65th fighting elsewhere isn't really getting any 
tougher.  The 40th who goes somewhere else will be much stronger the 
next time round.

EQ endgame is just that -- endgame. Going anywhere else is a step 
backwards if you are there. At 40th level if you try to engage something 
you can't take, go take somethign you can, and advance to where you can 
take it. At endgame, you don't advance except by going forward through 
the mob.

Honestly ... group A isn't suffering. Only a high level 'raid' would 
ever really need that many buffs, or even really have that many buffs to 
cast. At 40th level down you aren't raiding, and if you are making your 
groupmates put 15 buffs on you you are probably just wasting their time.

At 40th level in a well rounded group, you'd be scraping the barrel for 
relevant buffs to even get to 15... remind me why I need a cha boost on 
my rogue? or why we've hasted the magician? :D
