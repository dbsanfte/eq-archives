The second example isnt a visual effect, its the speech and attitude that
you don't even know what day it is... bad analogy.

Maybe its because at the higher level there is a lower number of idiots (or
maybe because reputations have a much bigger effect at these levels) but
name just doesn't come into it.  Your either a prick, or your not a prick,
and a lack of imagination when picking a name just doesn't come into it for
me.

If I was making a pickup group and /who 60 LFG came back with 2 results
60 rogue poke
60 paladin A_sensible_name

The rogue would win hands down every time, name just doesnt figure in with
my priorities in asessing somebody... sorry dps > imagination.

Masked swearing or blatant offensive terms is one thing, but seriously, why
do you let other peoples names bother you so much?  I see so much whining
about bitching about names..  lifes too short.

One of the best most friendly people I know in-game is called "Ubertank",
but even if you played on Prexus, I doubt you'd associate with him because
his name greatly offends you or some shit... Well it would be your loss to
not have him as a friend, thats 1 thing im sure about.
