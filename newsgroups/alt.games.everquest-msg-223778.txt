Its even more frustrating on the FV roleplay server with the trivial
loot code. You quickly get to the point where many of the quest drops
become trivial loot and wont drop for you. You REALLY have to plan out
your quests on this server ahead of time.

Even level 60+ quests sometimes leave you wondering WTF? Get used to
that feeling lol.

Like most tradeskills, Research only becomes worthwhile when you max
your skill. It took me a while to figure out that you can just spend
training points all the way up (doh). Since then, ive made quite a bit
of plat making and selling high level spells.

Not sure what you mean by this. LDON is great fun and really pushes
your boundries of how you play your characters. If you like a casual
pace, you may not like LDON. As for the "instant gratification" part,
for many, its not all that instant as it may take time to get a group,
although the recent change to allow groups of 3 may make it easier.
