Its way too late for me on this addy anyway. It was being used since way
way before any significant quantities of robot mailers were being spotted
so a trawl of google will pull it up anyway. It wouldnt stop much anyway
since the email is as you can see one of those alphanumerics that a random
generator can spew out and gets that sort of targeting anyway and did
before harvesting became popular. Also I cannot mung the address so its
unintelligible and therefore functions as a block (against local regs) and
these days harvesters can fairly easily parse most of useable forms for
giving your real addy for email replies which I need for more than one
Usenet group.

I rely on decent spam software and a UNIX mail client which combined allow
me to handle most things and be invulnerable to the rest. Signal to noise
ratio is more than acceptable....
