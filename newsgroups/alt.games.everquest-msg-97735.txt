From personal experience with having a 29th Level Cleric on one server, and
a 52nd level Druid on another.  Melee is the first thing to go.  You can't
hit worth a damn on dk blues or light blues, mostly because you loose 1
point per level of something you can reasonably melee with.  HP wise, you
are screwed, so you can't take hits very well, cause your Dodge is maxed
around 75, so getting slapped around by a mob is pretty easy.  I have tried
meleeing, but usually AFTER a mob is on the run, to conserve mana.  And
ever try hitting an HG with a 29th level cleric.  Wiff, wiff, wiff, hit for
1 point...  And this is with it running.  I ran out of stamina to keep it
up that I just sat down and waited for a bit before going after it again,
and that was because we couldn't hit it with spells it resisted that much.
(Had another Druid PL me and another Druid against an HG just for shits and
giggles.)

It was pretty sad.

As a 52nd level Druid, unless you are REALLY bored, you can take a whack at
it, with firefist and with wolf form, but never as a porcupine...  Some
mobs just hit too hard, too fast, and stun you too much to make it worth
while.
