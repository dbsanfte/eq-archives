Then they're pretty much out of luck.  I have a feeling they represent a
very small portion of the available market.  I'd also guess that poor
graphics would turn off far more people than the modest (by today's
standards) system requirements.

When EQ was in beta the Voodoo 1 was a hot gaming card, they cost
well over $100, and were 3d only.  They were originally considered to
be for hard core gamers only, yet EQ required a decent 3d card and
didn't suffer any loss of subscribers as a result.  I don't recall anyone
ever posting that the system reqs. were going to cause them to play
AC (with it's software rendering option).

People will either scrounge up the chump change necessary to get
a MX200 ($40) or not play.  If that's too much money for them, they
should wait until they're old enough to get a part-time job, and pay for
their games themselves.
