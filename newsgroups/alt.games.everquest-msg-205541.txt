Tier 2 and up, with a full group, gives you much better exp than you're
likely to find anywhere else. I can earn one AA every two hours or so
in PoV (and similar exp at hobgoblins in PoN). That's much better exp
than I've seen elsewhere, basically due to the availability of an
endless stream of high blue (or white, or yellow) MOBs.

I moved up to tier 2 at the time of the last major patch, so it's
difficult to compare exp rates. I know those I have grouped with have
been enthusiastic about the improvements in experience earned.

This may be true of much of tier 1 (PoJ/D/N) but exp in tier 2 really
is much better (and I've found demand for clerics in tier 2 is
just insane... since the patch I have not had LFG up for more than
ten minutes running.)

Depends on how you define "for exp". Exp won't be as good as in
PoP, but should still be decent some places.

Try the coterie centurions on the eastern part of the southern
edge of ME. Dark blue at 63, probably still so at 65 (they certainly
hit hard enough!)

There are also small batches of undead in HoH that are supposed to
be manageable by a solo cleric. From what I've read, it's fairly
marginal and you need some hammer with a clicky undead DOT for it to
be practical (Hammer of the Sun or some such).
