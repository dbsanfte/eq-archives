You do not need a symbol if you are in a decent group that is able to
handle the area you are pulling... you need one if you are in over your
head, sure, but with a monk puller -and- a chanter, you really should be
fine without.  Your monk puller, likewise, should not need a symbol,
unless (and this certainly does happen) he's pulling stuff thats rather too
hard for him and needs the boost.  Your chanter... well yes, chanters
need symbols and you give it to them no matter what anyone says.  If
it comes out of your pocket you give it to em because its simply better
than everyone dying.  Your main tank... he may or may not need one.
Again if he's over his head he surely does need one, but if he is (as often
happens) the lone level 60 in the group, he might be fine without it, depends

on whether you are using CHeal still, or have moved on to the far more
efficient Mark of Karn strategy.

I'm not that conservative with symbols because of the cost, its the mana
and resultant down time that makes me question thier use.  Thus everyone
often starts out with symbol for breakin purposes, assuming that we
had some time porting around and so forth picking up so I could med the
mana back.  Breakin is also the most dangerous time, and the time when
the group is the least used to supporting each other as a team, quirks and
all.  Once we are going well, though, I should have a good idea who really
needs symbol and who doesn't, and I'm not dropping that kind of mana
into the ones that don't.

At any rate, although I -can- eat the cost happily, and often do, I said that

the symbol cost is normally covered out of the take before split.  Therefore
its not a case of "everyone but the cleric gets 500 and I get 400" but rather

"everyone gets 480 instead of 500, and I get 480+160=640"

Yes, this is crucial to the concept working.  ML should be someone who
is trustworthy, most often the cleric or the chanter.  Port out to WC,
sell to the druid vendor or the one in the fisherman hut, hand cleric cash
refund, split remainder, then roll items.  Anyone who leaves before this
happens is making a statement that he doesn't want the cash or loot, and
many don't care about it really.  Any ML who does so, on the other hand,
is going to rapidly get a bad rep... ML doesn't "forget" to split loot, its
what that job is all about.

Here's a handy trick.  Move dots around at start of a run so that you
have a full stack in the upper left hand location.  Now its easy to see
how many you took out of that stack.  When you need to leave group
or group splits up, take a peak and then say "6 peridot used, 60pp please"
before any split is made.  Again this sort of thing shouldn't be necessary,
but since you are having trouble, this is a nice simple way to take care
of it.  Sensible people will see at once that this is fair, and the people
who
object can rapidly be put on your ignore list (which helps me to remember
not to group with people long after I've forgotten why)

Cleric ML is a very good plan for any cleric who is getting screwed on
loot regularly.  Anyone who objects to cleric as ML is asking not to
group with the cleric.  On the other hand, if you have someone you
can trust, rogue or warrior is likely the best ML, with a higher strength
and no reason to sit down, less mana is wasted from the "I could have
been sitting" phenomenum of cleric looter.

FFA loot, Autosplit loot, alpha loot.. all of these pale compared to a
-proper- ML loot plan with someone you can trust.  And you can
always trust you, can't you?
