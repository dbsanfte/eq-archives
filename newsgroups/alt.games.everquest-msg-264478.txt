Is there any dynamicism to this?  Can something come, either on the pull or
later, that the con system said would not come?

For instance, in DAoC, there are mobs that don't mind if you pull their
neighbors.  Giant ants, for example.  First time I found them, I cautiously
pulled one with an arrow, and it came alone.  Even when I was grouped with
someone, they came alone.  The conned non-aggro, too.  So, I stopped
bothering with arrows, and would just fight them where they stood, ignoring
the others around me.

Until one day, as I fought one, I saw this message scroll by in the combat
spam:

    A giant ant calls for help!

and the whole freaking ant colony came down on my head.  Oops.

I think a game should have things like that to keep you on your toes.
