I'm not much of a businessman.  I work a full-time job and own 3
multi-family properties.  I personally wouldn't walk in on ANY of my tenants
and say "Oh, this check isn't big enough this month".  Of course, that's not
legal here with rent.  I also don't jump on the "rate bandwagon" and screw
my tenants either.  Sure, most 2 and 3 bedrooms average $800/$1100 a month
where I live, but I still manage to swing renting them out at $650 &$850
giving my tenants a great deal.
You what else?  Even though I'm not "raking in the dough" like a lot of
other landlords in my area, I still manage to answer the phone EVERY time a
tenant calls and have the problem fixed ASAP.  Let's see Sony do that
(unless of course it's over billing)

I'm still playing but I honestly doubt anything will change on VI/Sony's
performance.  Evidently, I'm in the wrong business.
