Magicians are your friends . Not ony is fluffy a decent dammage dealer, the
magician click booties are highly dammaging. Mala lets the chanter slow the
mobs on the first try so that aggro is not a problem and after you have
received a mystical transvergence a few times you will never want to be
without it. The sk makes an excellant puller and tank. Dont think I could
have done this so well with any other group of 4 though 5 and 6 men groups
make it trivial. What was so interesting abou the group was none of us
really expected it to work quite so well. After the first hour we no longer
expected to be eaten at every turn :)
