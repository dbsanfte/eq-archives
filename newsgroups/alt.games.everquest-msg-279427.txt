Pfft. Seems like way more analysis than this situation warrants. Red 
gets one's attention, just as would be expected of a shout.

Granted, my thinking that it's unduly protested does assume that people 
would use it correctly, which is surely too much to ask.

Sorry. I still cannot connect /auction with anything that doesn't 
involve some sort of transaction. Using the /auction channel for 
anything other than barter just seems silly.

That's just way too much read into it. Perhaps red isn't the most 
appropriate color for an RP shout (it's debatable), but the idea of 
using the /shout channel for such cummunication *is* most appropriate. 
That's the part I have trouble resolving.

Of course you don't. However, real life scenarios don't exactly compare 
too well with most EQ situations for any number of reasons.

Again, that usage would be inappropriate in either scenario. Bad 
example.

Oh, I agree that it happens. That doesn't make it appropriate. The fact 
that some would abuse the /shout channel doesn't make it wrong for 
others to use it in a non-emergency.

Like I said, /auction implies a transaction or bartering by it's very 
definition. Seems pretty simple to me. You're the first person I've 
every seen suggest using the /auction channel for anything else.

Right. They give you peanuts. You give them money. That's what /auction 
is for.

Again, your comparison to real life scenarios is invalid. This is EQ. If 
communicating with eveyone in the entire zone is to be considered wrong, 
then people should not use /ooc or /auction either.

RL != EQ. Your comparison is invalid.

As I've mentioned, /shout should certainly not be used conversationally 
in any case.
