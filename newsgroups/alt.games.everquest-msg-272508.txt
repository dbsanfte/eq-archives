I'm a level 23 Assassin and I have never, ever been the group's puller.
I find this very odd as you'd have thought that scouts would be good
pullers.

I can track to the correct mobs if we need a particular one.  I have a
low agro, long distance pulling tool with Stalk.  This, for those that
don't know, is an ability that reduces agro but if there is no agro on
the mob it puts you on the mob's hate list with very little agro - I'd
have thought that the tank could take agro from me very quickly.  Also,
the range on this ability is huge - way further than my bow.  As there
doesn't seem to be any assist agro, the fact that I can pull at such a
distance can only reduce the number of possible adds.

In every group that I have been in the main tank has been the puller.
Whenever I have suggested that I pull it is made clear that the tank is
the puller.  Even when I have found what we want on track and the tank
is just running around looking for it.  I have to point out the
direction the mob is and (s)he runs off after it.

Has anyone tried letting the scouts do the pulling?  If so what was the
result.  Apart from the easier agro management why would the main tank
be a better puller?
