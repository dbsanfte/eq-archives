You know, of course, that the 8x agp version is only worth it if you
have an 8x AGP motherboard. Otherwise it would only be 4 x agp.  If
your motherboard is only 4x agp I'd find a 4x version which would
likely be cheaper. The 8x agp ones are newer.

If you do have a rig that is fairly powerful, with the 8x agp slot on
the mboard and such, you might want to save up some more cash. The
geforce FX will be coming out soon and will make the current 4000
series cards look like little girls.
