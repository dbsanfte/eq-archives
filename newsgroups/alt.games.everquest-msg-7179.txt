I freely admit to being a nerd/geek whatever. As I have said before, I like
my life the way it is. Things are peaceful, for once. My pass times are less
stressful, physically and emotionally, my Job is better, I know longer train
because I feel driven to for an edge but because I have some spare time, or
I want to.
Yep, being a nerd is great, shoulda done it years ago. I have definitely
become more introverted but scared of real people, I don't I've reached that
stage yet, might happen, you never know.

As for mature...nope, I can't really be accused of that...I try to be
responsible but maturity is not something I am aiming for.

Not sure what the point of this is, Vengy...Again, as I have said before,
someone that enjoys flame wars and declares they are an old hand at usernet,
plays at being a WWII pilot on a computer etc...Erm sorry man but you look
just as nerdy as the rest of us.

Picture may follow, sometime

(looks for a picture he looks good in...could be a short wait for this)
