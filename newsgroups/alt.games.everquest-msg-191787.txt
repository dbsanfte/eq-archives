This is a troll right?
Well besides doing everthing you could do to keep yourself broke I
dont think a new location is going to change anything. Ok just in case
you are serious;
First no plat no symbol..
Second Cleric is ALWAYS ML if Im playing cleric and please dont give

These will at least keep you solvent but until you learn them forget
it.
