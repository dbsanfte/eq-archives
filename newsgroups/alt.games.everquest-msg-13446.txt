So... you'd prefer to be certain you don't have it, rather than taking a small
chance that you won't have it? ;)

*shrug*   In my opinion, there are only two buffs that make that much of a
difference that they should be on at all times, and will request that they be
done if the person in charge of it isn't doing it.   SoW and a haste buff.

I suppose you have a point if you're camping a zone line... but considering
I've camped on a zone line exactly once over the last four months... (Camped
the Chardok exit for a night) thats not much of an issue for me. : P
