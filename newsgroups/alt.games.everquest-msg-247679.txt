Ah, but you see, I am not only getting xp from them, the gems they drop 
sell for 45 pp, and the hides sell for 100 pp in bazaar, and when my kei 
drops I can fish for the cod to turn into oil for 35pp per oil in bazaar.

I get xp, and make legitemate plat to buy things with. The only thing a 
65 druid is getting is pp for the gems and hides. And maybe someone is 
doing the quest that needs the no drop thing to brew into beer...

Not only that, but the wyverns dont hit for much more than 100, and I 
can take a few shots of that while I am rerooting them, and generally 
cast through it...but any mobs that hit harder I probably *can't* cast 
through, and with an unbuffed 1900 hp, I can't take too many shots if my 
temp drops in the middle...

FWIW, don't I have the *same* hunting rights in a zone? I thought 
everybody just got finished saying that anybody has the right to hunt in 
a zone, and if you actually are managing to get xp it is even better 
that you are hunting in a zone more to your level...it isnt like I am 
complaing about trying to hunt in OT which is pretty much deep green to 
me and complaining about the 35-40 level druid kiting around....

I just want some solo xp in one of the few zones I can get it in, and 
some plat so I don't need to buy it from Yantis <evil grin>
