True enough, but often you need to find a merchant anyway to sell
off other loot.  I.e., when your bags get full, and you go find a
merchant to sell off (and many mid-level hunting zones do have
merchants), it's nice to be able to spend another minute converting
the small coins to something lighter.

You're right, of course, that you can get rid of the coins completely
by buying other items.  (Bandages are a favorite of mine; I'm going to
need them anyway. :-)  Though NPCs sometimes have ridiculous markups,
especially on magic items, for many mundane items they have a simple
+/- 5% rule: they offer you ~5% less than X, and they charge ~5% more
than X.  E.g., for rubies X is 125, so you can buy them at 131.249 and
sell them for 119.048, so I sometimes use the gem merchant in NW Rathe
to save weight when I'm hunting Hill Giants.
