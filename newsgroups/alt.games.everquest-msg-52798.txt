Has Befallen been changed again, for like the 10th time?
I know I put together a group of 31-38ies to make a familiarization
raid for my earlier guild, and we had a hard time in the "new" befallen.
That was some months ago... One warrior went back out for a reason
and when he came back in, he almost didn't make it back to our
group on second floor, after being harmtouched for *a lot* :)
by an ugly shadowknight...
That was some months ago.

Then, when the actual raid took place, we found Befallen back
to normal: No more DEFs except the usual ones, no more
"someones pets" and the like...
We easily wiped third floor and later I could easily wander
around the bottom floor on my own, being a level 32 to 34
(I can't remember exactly) necro by then...

That was already the second time it was changed back and forth...

And we spent some gametime-days there, so it couldn't have been
a day/night change of mobs, maybe a weekly one?

Anyone got some input on this?
