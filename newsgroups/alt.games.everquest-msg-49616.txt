Kill Giants in Front Mtns in Kunark.  You can make several hundred plat a
day around level 30. The xp here sucks in a full group (or any group over 2)
but the loot is great.  The swords sell for around 30pp to 50pp to
merchants, the axe's hammers and grub diggers sell for around 11pp each to
merchants and the tunics sell for around 60pp to merchants.  The caps sell
for around 20pp to merchants and this loot is all common.  The rare loot is
the Forrest Loops (earrings) which sell for several hundred plat to players
due to the AC, dex, wis combo.  No need for a special strategy.... just kill
and enjoy.
