SoL, it seems to me, is a "do I quit or stay" point?  In some ways,
Kunark was like that for high level people, because of the raised
level cap.

Velious was mostly just new content.  It was perfectly feasible to not
buy Velious, and you would not be overly limiting yourself, unless you
had dreams of being uber.

SoL, from my viewpoint at level 52, requires major thought.  My guild
is just starting to do places like SG and DN, and getting ready for
ToV.  We've got months left on Velious, so I don't *need* the new
zones.

Six months ago, I'd have jumped at the chance to start a Beastlord,
and it would have to be a kitty, because that was it would be in
newbie zones that I hadn't already played a dozen characters in.
However, now there is DAoC, and I'd rather spend *new* time there
rather than on a kitty Beastlord.  (Why?  DAoC has a much better
underlying system than EQ.  EQ is way ahead on content.  Adding
content is a lot easier than changing the underlying system, so I
think that Mythic will fix the content problems quicker than Verant
will fix the underlying system).

So, getting back to my level 52 EQ character...the big thing SoL
offers is the alternate advancement system.  Some of those abilities
look nice.  However, the ones I'd really like are higher level, and
looking at the amount of XP it would take to get them, it looks like
I'd have to become a full-time EQ player if I want them this decade.

So, more than any prior expansion, it seems to me SoL is a personal
turning point.
