OK, whenever I try to do the warrior quest tree in Qeynos, when I get to
the part where you are supposed to fight the monster in the pens under
the arena, as soon as he gives me the key, the server kicks me. When I
get back in, there is no mob to kill. I have to do two long quests to
get back there again... To have it crash. How can I complete this?
