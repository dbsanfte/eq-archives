I think that they should make that charm available to all characters; it
would be easy to just sell it in PoK for a hundred plat, say; expensive
enough that a newbie would rather go through the tutorial but not so
expensive that a character too high for the tute couldn't get it if they
wanted it. The charm slot is terribly neglected for non-firona vie players.

I've often thought about transferring to FV just so i could buy a few of the
things you can only get there but it's just a dream :)
