There's also the factor that it sounds like the OP is fairly new to the
area. I spent quite a few levels on two different characters up there,
and I STILL get lost running through. The canyons are twisty, dark, and
confusing and most maps are fairly useless. A lot of the turns head into
blind deadend canyons. Dragging a train of twenty orcs into one of those
could pretty effetively mess up your day as well.
