I have an oppertunity to get a SoS pretty cheap( I think) at 800 pp. I
have been looking around at various sites that returned a response to
a Google search and am getting mixed reviews on the weapon, some say
It does damage to group members as a result of  AoE.  Is this true?


Others say it is a great weapon except in dungons. They didn't say
why.

The char that would be using it is a 41 Warr.  Any thoughts?
