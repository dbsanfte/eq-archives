Israel won the right to be where they are in a war.  Just as the US
won the right to create the United States when the defeated the
British in a war.

Let me put it in perspective for you..

The United States, after defeating British and winning the RIGHT to
create a new state declare, under pressure from whiney Britons, "Oh,
we were just play fighting, Britian.  Here is all your land back and
we'll be happy to go back to the way things were."

That makes about as much sense as what you propose...
