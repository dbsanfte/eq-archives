What gets me is the random tells for clarity I get because I didn't
have the foresight to turn on anon.  If someone is standing right next
to me and says "Hey Farghen, spare a clarity?", I usually just target
them and right-click my pants.
If you ask me for a buff, and I type /target yourName and don't get
you on my cursor, tough luck.

I take particular offense to anonymous people who do "/who enchanter"
and then hit me up for buffs.  I usually have fun with these people:

Someguy tells Farghen, 'can u clarity me'
Farghen types, '/who Someguy'
Someguy [anonymous]
Farghen tells Someguy, 'Why are you anonymous?'
Someguy tells Farghen, 'Well I'm a druid.  If I'm not anonymous, I get
non-stop tells from people asking for buffs and ports.'
Farghen tells Someguy, 'Ironic ain't it?'


Not busting on druids, but am busting on anonymous people. :-)


And if you're in Ak'Anon killing gnomes, don't even bother asking!
