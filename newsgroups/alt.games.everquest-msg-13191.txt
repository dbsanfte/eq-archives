There are a number of people still bound there on Tribunal.  I am one of
them.  It is incredibly useful.  I have been attacked by the random
Feydedar only twice in over 15 calendar  months I have been bound there,
with Jboots it was easy to haul ass to a random port before getting
whacked.  If you get feared in the room, you port to the safe spot in the
zone because of pathing.
