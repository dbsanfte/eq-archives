Do you really think a question on the current status of servers is one
that you would think would be likely answered by a search?  Also, the
idiosyncrasies of this group aren't something you can expect to be
completely picked by looking at 'a couple posts'.

Listen, if the regs here feel it necessary to mock and flame newbie
questions so be it, but don't get pissed off when you get flamed in
return.

Good.  Cheating in online multiplayer games annoys me.  Greatly.

Well the latter assumption is correct.  However, I took your advise
and read the FAQ.  Specifically, the Updated FAQ as of Mar 02/02.
http://groups.google.ca/groups?q=faq+alt.games.everquest+group:alt.gam
es.everquest&hl=en&selm=Dr8g8.63308%24vP.256311%40rwcrnsc51.ops.asp.at
t.net&rnum=8

There is no mention of hacking as a hotbutton issue, or anything that
would lead one to believe that.  There is no mention of server
downtime... the only mention of the servers at all is their physical
location.   However, the FAQ does condemn flaming, which the ng regs
violated quite handily to start out this discussion.  Perhaps they are
due for a 'refresher' reading of the FAQ?

I'm quite familiar with usenet myself, and I agree that reading the
FAQ and lurking for a bit is a good idea.  But posting a simple
question not covered in the FAQ is hardly condemnable.  At worse,
deserving of a pointer to the relevant info.

I've used EQW, it is quite handy.  Is that considered cheating?

Hell,

The first two seem to be accurate, but reading this group for a day
leads me to believe that #3 is false ;)

:)

Maybe some of us just like a good pissing match ;).  The original post
was not a troll, however, and ended up generating a troll-like
responce due to the... unique character of this group.    That's my
diagnosis, anyway.
