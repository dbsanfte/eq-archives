The game is not minimizable by choice. It makes it noticeably harder to
run third-party macro programs like the ones that pretty much ruined
Diablo (and had an impact in UO, although I haven't played it, so I
can't tell if it was *ruined* by them). If you get bored while
meditating, get a second computer or play /gems. :)
