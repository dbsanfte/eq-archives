The cheap way to get started with Smithing is Metal Bits to 21, then
Toolboxes to 51.  A Metal bit is 2 small pieces + 1 water (all unstacked).
The toolbox is 1 bit + 1 water.  What I recommend is to make tons of bits to
get to 21, then use them all to make toolboxes to 51.  Since you have to
make the bits anyway, you might as well let them gets you some skill for it.
