Made it to lvl 55 with 0% AA, and for a mage that's the most important level
(CoH). At a safe 2 yellow into 55, I'm collecting 100% AA for running speed
3 so I can solo a lot more effectively and break for a run in dungeons like
Velks. After I got running speed 3 I go to lvl 56 (mod rod 2) and then set
AA to 0%. At 60 I go for 50/50 till I get 2 yellows as a "safe margin". Then
all-out AA till Sage or something :)
