I used one up until a few months ago when I bought a 64mb Geforce2 ti (not
sure what prev GF2 that replaced) the Kyro (Prophet 4600 64mb) worked ok
with EQ in general, I got frame loss in zones like Twilight and Shar Vahl
and occasionally got those wobbly textures on the ground but no other
problems.
The GF2 wasn't really a noticable improvement.

Spec was
PIII 600 (@800)
512mb Ram
KyroII 64mb
SB128

This was my second machine and ran EQ adequately.
The card was actually given on to my friend who has had nothing but crap
with it :ï¿½/ Not working properly with MoHAA or DAoC and the new drivers are
apparently XP only, I am thinking of swapping back as the GF2 might be
better for him and certainly was no real improvement for me.

I can't say I would necessarily recommend one of these but I certainly
didn't have any problem, personally I'd wait for the GF4 ti4200 chipset,
this is an intermediate chipset that is a cut down 4400 but at not much more
than the GF4mx card. It is believed this has been held back to help the sale
of older GF3's as this isn't far behind in benchmarks, even surpassing the
old ti500 in some higher res tests.
