Twinked monks maybe.  But then, a twinked warrior or rogue can solo.

My monk was extremely untwinked, I leveled when crescent armour was uber,
and you didnt get better than an fbss (fungis werent even buyable back then)

I couldnt solo shit past level 40.  Even mid 50's id get tore up in DL by
drolvargs.  Velks spiders would tear me up too.  Yeah my gear was ghetto,
but like i said... if were talking untwinked players, dont think they are
soloing machines
