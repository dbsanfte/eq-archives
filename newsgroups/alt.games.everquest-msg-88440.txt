Not sure if WinEQ is the same thing as EQw... but EQw is indeed broken after
this last patch.

I can still run EQ in a window, but my Cursor remains the Windows cursor.  I
can't CTRL-ALT-R to switch between cursors anymore.

I have e-mailed JustSomeDude about this, havn't recieved a reply, but I am
sure he is aware of this and is working it (at least that is what I am
hoping for)

On a side note, Xylobot also seems to have been adversely effected by the
new patch.  From some speculation there, I believe it has to do with EQ
finally changing from some of the EQ functions still using DirectX7 calls up
to the DX8.1 calls... not a developer so don't quote me on that.
