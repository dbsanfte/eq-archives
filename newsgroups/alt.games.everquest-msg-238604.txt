(Oh my Lord, snip.)


In his own warped way, I think bizbee was right.  This was the most moronic
post I've ever made to usenet.  My apologies to all posters and lurkers
here.  However, I do thank all who contributed replies.  It was all
exceedingly therapeutic.

I think back to the kind of person I used to be not too many years ago, and
I just can't believe I blew all this EQ pseudo-relationship/pretend
boyfriend, girlfriend crap so far out of proportion.

Even though I found that I couldn't enjoy EQ anymore for so many reasons, I
hope each and every one of you continues to have fun in the game.  And
seriously, I did get my money's worth.
