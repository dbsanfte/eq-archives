I met my first female gnome warrior last night. She was level 16,
wearing chain and a sarnak emblazoned tabard, and looking for a port
from Steamfont to WC. I gave her the port and a sow, on the house :)

It bugs me if on the rare occasions I ask for hunting suggestions (my
ISP is not solo friendly but I might start doing it a little after 44)
the person I asks suggests dwarves, gnomes, or some random good/
factionless NPC.
