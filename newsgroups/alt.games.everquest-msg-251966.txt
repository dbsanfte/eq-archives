Nonsense, two can easily solo in many places.  Why I've seen up to six 
soloing in Cobalt Scar, with minimal squabbling over who is stealing 
who's mobs.

Worse, not only can people solo in the same zone, they can even solo 
together; support each other with buffs, or agree to split overlarge 
pulls, stagger their pulls so each is busy medding and ready to help in 
an emergency if the other gets into trouble.

This isn't to say its clever to do so; I recall my cleric soloing in 
COM, a ranger coming in, refusing group, and soloing next to me.  He and 
I soloed together for about a half hour, and I have to admit he was 
killing twice as many mobs as I was in that time; I got about three, he 
got about 6.  Then I convinced him to try grouping up, in the next half 
hour the two of us killed about 30 mobs; getting roughly the exp for 
killing 15.  For me, five times as good, but even for him, more than 
twice as good.  Neither of us had to zone out due to our own or our 
neighbor's overpull, either!

Still, consider a bard; very often he's better off not taking any sort 
of partner, since the odds of the partner helping more than marginally 
are low, and the odds of the partner screwing things up are high. 
Wouldn't be a bad thing, though, to have a friendly neighbor  soloing 
nearby with a mutual assistance pact.

Then there's people widely seperated by level; if you can find a place 
where both have soloing opportunities, the higher level character can 
refresh short term buffs like a DS on the friend at relatively little 
cost to himself, and go on about his business; he'll not see much 
benefit, but the lower level guy will see lots of benefit, and yet won't 
have suffer being on the low end of any exp split (or getting no exp at 
all due to the friend being too high a level).  This is more common in 
places where the high level is farming greens for trade skill stuff than 
where there are legitimate exp targets for both... but it does happen.
