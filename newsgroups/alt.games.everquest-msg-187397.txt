Your reading of the haste situation is correct.  Fleshgrinder is a
nice weapon (mainhanded it outdamaged Swiftblade of Zek consistently
for me) as is Disemboweler which probably outdamages both over an
extended period.  I'd forget about the Snowchipper.

Level           Max Haste 

30                   50%    
50                   74%    
54                   84%    
59                   94%    
60                  100%

PS: Get 60th it's worth it.
