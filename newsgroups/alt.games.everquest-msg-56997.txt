Hi Folks.

AOL UK have just introduced a 45 minute cut off to their UK Flat Rate
package by way of a pop up box you must click to stay online otherwise
the service disconnects. Obviously with games like EQ and DAoC which
don't allow you to ALT-TAB you cannot see the pop up and therefore you
get disconnected every 45 minutes.

Is there a work around for this ?. If not it's a no go for gamers. Who
wants a group member who goes bye bye every three quarters of an hour
?. I'm not sure if this applies to AOL in the US but it was introduced
in the UK, without announcement I hasten to add, two days ago. I was
going nuts wondering why I was getting cut off all the time until I
timed the disconnects to 45 minutes on the nose. AOL UK have confirmed
this. If anyone has a work around please share it. Seems to me AOL UK
will lose a lot of accounts over this. Maybe that is what they want ?.
It's not just gamers, anyone who does unattended downloads with Get
Right etc. will no longer be able to do so. Seems AOL does not want my
money every month anymore....

B.B.
