Man are you people so stupid... what schools did you all go to? they
must of taught you some pre-school shit at 12th grade, so what happens
if someone doesnt have a credit card? they cant play? thats pure
bullshit and im not ganna put up with false advertisement. why in the
hell didnt it say on the fucking box that you must have a credit card
in order to play? any idiot would be stupid to give out there credit
card number if they havent tested the product yet. what happens if EQ
decided to go evil and steal your credit card number and cancel all
your EQ accounts and leave town? you guys would look stupid then
wouldnt you. see it my way man...i think if a person buys a product
they should get a chance to try it out before they do anything drastic
like giving out there credit card number...i bet everquest is stupid
anyways, i bet one couldnt gain shit for skills in 1 day. ill forget
this hell whole i almost gotten myself into and ill just play the
other online that promise what they say they'll give you, but mark my
words... stealing from max powers is a bad idea, and i dont give up to
easyly.. all shall know that EQ is a bad choice from now on... im
quite use to destroying things anyways..for those of you who want to
be losers, go right ahead and support everquest, be robbed.. i dont
care..you all probably are fat lazy bastards with no wifes... that
like to eat doritos in your parents basement with a lack of education
and cant get laid and with no friends at all... heh enough said
