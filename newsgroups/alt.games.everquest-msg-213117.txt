Lance is right, unless things have changed since I played my monk a while
(years ago) back.
Feign, done after a spell is started but before it lands, will be broken.
I can start a buff (or heal) on you, you feign, and boom, your feign will be
broken when it lands.

I used that to kill a monk training my enchanter once about 2 years ago
(well, actually he died 4 times, but he was persistent in feign training us.
It was funny when the guide arrived about his petition for me grief killing
him before the one arrived about my petition about him training us).
