   Cleric.  Obviously.  And clerics do get a snare clicky.... as
long as the worship Inny.  However, that whole water into wine
thing leads me to suspect that he was in fact a Brell

of people look to as their personal savior was actually a Dwarf. 
Could be worse, I suppose... He could have been a halfing.

   I think I'd rather worship twigs and berries like the Mormons
and Wiccans do.
