Main healer can be pretty stressful. If you go AFK *everybody* needs
to know and a moment of inattention can lead to a death (or a wipe).

That's my theory anyway. As I don't play a druid (never even rolled
one up) I'm pretty much speculating here.

Note that I'm not saying druids can't be main healer. From level 58
onwards, a druid can likely heal your group with 90% of the efficiency
of a cleric; given the burstiness of PoP damage, it's best to heal
early, with the result that most CHeals hit for under 3k.

Since with better PoP groups I usually have mana left to nuke about
once per MOB, and the druid's nuke is going to work better than mine,
the druid can certainly fill in as main healer, and their nukes will
do more damage on average. Get a paladin as an MA and they can rez
for you. That combination is less of an option in LDoN for the reasons
outlined in my earlier post.

Anyway, my post wasn't intended as a criticism of druids. Druids have
some solid advantages - they can snare, which is always invaluable,
their nukes hit for more, Pot9's only downside is that the poor cleric
will be tripling their peridot costs if you're getting a Symbol to
stack with it...

My main point was that in a group, particularly a dungeon group where
some druid spell lines are useless, clerics are not nearly as useless
as the OP would represent. Not that that's surprising given the...
expertise of the OP.

If you're talking balance, basically clerics have the edge sometimes
and druids have the edge sometimes in a grouping situation - clerics
mainly with the very high or burst DPS MOBs, druids in outdoor zones
where their utility spells become much more useful. With soloing,
druids have a clear edge. With raids, clerics have an edge because
of the power of CHeal.
