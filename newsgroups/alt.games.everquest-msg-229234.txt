Not surprising - I was only on for an hour or so this morning.  Crashed
twice, locked up XP hard once.

Couple of other oddities -
 - Couldn't zone from Everfrost to Halas.  Kept sending me back to the
newbie respawn point outside the Halas ramp.
 - Coming back from Halas (I eventually made it after the lockup), I ran
into a newb being chased by a vengeful.  Guards did nothing - didn't even
move.  This was up top of the ramp, by the merchants.

Too frustrating, logged off...
