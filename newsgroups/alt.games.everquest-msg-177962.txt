Nearly everytime I think about quadding... halfway through... zzzz....

After charm (not dire charm) soloing for 8 hours straight I fall asleep and
my pet eats me.  Plus my bladder *really* needs emptying.

Waiting on respawn while helping a bard friend get reequipped after he lost
his corpse (we were getting him the DE mask from lguk, bard was, umm 32 I
think, me 56 and 54 warrior, started with all 3 of us, but by the end I was
3-boxing with the bard on afk manasong.  Anyway, I fell asleep and woke up
to a frog beating on me, and me at 54% hp, still kicked its ass though.
