I'm curious. In my experience, LDoN pickup groups choose Normal Difficulty
probably 98% of the time. Since I have little to no interest in the ladder
portion of the system, I don't find losing an adventure to be the end of the
world. I strongly prefer getting the experience benefits from a Hard
adventure and love the rush of succeeding in one, but I can't find much
interest in this from adhoc pickup groups.

What's your ratio of Normal to High difficulty, and what's your preference?
