Poisons and potions will most likely take off after the new patch.
They are finally adding a way to search for poisons on the broker, so
scouts can actually find them.  I didn't notice (because poisons were

I just found out that somebody (alchemists?) make a healing potion a
few nights ago... I really could have used that when I would go out
soloing :/
