/cheer soulbinders

About time these came into the game. Everyone sick of /ooc for a bind and
having to bribe a caster.

e.g. My lvl 7 monk twink went from Qeynos to fight in the commons. Went to
Freeport bank and sent tell to a lvl 28 Enchanter sitting there asking if
they would mind binding me please for a donation.

,.... no reply

/ooc Paying 30pp for bind at bank. Lo and behold suddenly mr chanter wants
to bind me, took the bind from someone else though

This will make the game better for non self binding classes. They can now
travel to different places and bind as they go along in the nearest
available town. /cheer verant

rest of patch? still no fixes for poor frame rates and strangeness for
sounds and gfx
