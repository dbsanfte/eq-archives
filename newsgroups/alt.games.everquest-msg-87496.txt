Guildmate sends me a tell last night, seeking to group with my 15 necro.
I tell her to come on over to Oasis, and we'll whack crocs.

<SYSTEM WIDE MESSAGE> the world will come down in 15 minutes.

She sends me a tell asking if she should come any way. I say I'm staying
until the world ends.

<MORE OF THESE MESSAGES> while I kill crocs and she runs from Freeport.

She finally arrives and I invite her into the group. She says, "Well, I
guess we won't have much time to play together, huh?"

YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED. Before I could even respond.
