One thing you can do here is hunt in Najena, since you need the pages for
epic from Mages anyway, the other thing you can do is get a partner and make
a raid. Then all things drop and nothing is marked as trivial. Simple way to
get these magic items if you really need em. Not to mention I think you need
some of these for your epic anyway so I would guess they will drop anyway.
