Lukkas

I have had this happen to me mnay times.  The cause , as I see it, is that
when people land on the port spot they stand there..this causes the damage
from falling.  I must say I have not died but I have been seriously wounded
from it.  I feel it should be common courtesy for those porting in to move
to the side or back upon  arrival to prevent this...but hey..who am I to
say! =)

As for the rez from the GM. I might think you were lucky as they do not
usually rez for this as it isn't really a bug per se.  Good luck in your
wandering and may Karana watch over you ( She must have been looking away
when you fell<g>)
