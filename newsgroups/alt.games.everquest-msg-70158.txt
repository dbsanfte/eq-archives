So...  you think the fungi tunic was "fixed"?

No, it was nerfed, plain and simple.  According to the general rules of how
armor works in the game, warriors, monks, shamans can all wear fungi.
Beastlord is an obvious class for it (and was on it, thus the nerf).

It will *probably* be un-nerfed, but who knows.  They already even put in an
alternative fungi tunic that beastlords can wear so they may think that's
enough.

I do know that my beastlord will get little play until the fungi is
un-nerfed.  May mean that my beastlord never gets past the low teens.  I
think if Verant sees this as the general trend, and they will as beastlords
aren't "needed" at the high end so no guild-PL by the ubers or wannabes,
then they will un-nerf the fungi to get more people playing cats.  Not
everyone that wants a high level cat has a druid on a second account to PL,
and even of those that do a lot would rather *play* than PL, albeit at an
advanced rate with a built in regen.

Mainly, I think Verant wants the race to be first to 60 to be untainted. 
How they can be so blind, I'm not sure, as the first to 60 *will* have the
PLing druid on a second account and probably wouldn't have worn fungi even
if it hadn't been nerfed.
