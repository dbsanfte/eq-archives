Only when buying and selling things from NPC vendors. =)
Other than that no way. You are a tank AC is King.

No. And I would never wear a bronze girdle either. Get a thick leather Apron AC 8
or get a Straw spun belt AC10, ASAP!

Nope. If you were on a high level raid and needed poison save versus a
dragon breath weapon and you weren't main tank maybe but 99% of the
time you are going to be being beat on by mobs.

If you are fighting poisoning mobs or necros and shamans then just get some
poison buffs for the fights but don't sacrifice AC.

And charisma for paladins isn't good for anything except improving your
prices at NPC merchants. Save the neck piece for buying and selling and
dump that belt.
