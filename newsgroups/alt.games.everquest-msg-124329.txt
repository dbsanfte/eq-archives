Monks are damage dealers;  warriors are damage takers.  Assuming
everything's equal, a monk will out-damage a warrior from 1 to
60.

"* Melee Tables *

Melee combat is based, at least in part, on tables that determines
how each class functions. Up until 50th level melee and hybrid classes
are on the same table, with the exception being monks who are on a
separate table (one that has them doing more damage). At 50th level
warriors, rogues and rangers were all moved to the monk table along
with the monk, who did not receive a new separate table.

Monks, however, are intended to be somewhat better at dealing out
damage in combat than warriors. To slightly improve their combat
prowess they will be working from an improved combat table once
they reach 55th level and again at 60th level. This will improve the
combat ability of monks somewhat, essentially placing them a half a
step ahead of everyone else in toe-to-toe combat in the same way that
they were prior to 50th level. The rogue will still maintain a margin
of superiority when you consider their ability to backstab."
