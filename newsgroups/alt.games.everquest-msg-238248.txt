I am the guy who originally posted this.  I am really just giving (gave 
actually, though I do not know who took it) away this account because it 
seems such a waste to just throw it away (hey, the software plus all the 
expansions plus 3 months; that starts to add up).  So instead of 
throwing it away I gave it away here.

I am very obsessive about EQ and if I did not give the account away I 
know exactly what I would do tomorrow:  I would be downloading the 
patcher and reinstalling everything from scratch again -- for the 
umpteenth time!  EQ is very hard to quit so I am just giving it away 
after I deleted my characters.

Well anyhow, somebody got lucky.  Would be nice if they would post here 
to acknowledge it.

I never thought my generosity would be perceived as a potential 
mischievous plot.
