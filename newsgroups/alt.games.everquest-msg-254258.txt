I think I should clarify. I'm talking about the items themselves, NOT 
what is found on a mob. I know that the loot found on a mob is random 
(well, randomly chosen from a predefined list for that mob type), but 
what I'm curious about is whether there are items with random magical 
stats on them or not. Is every magic item X going to have the exact same 
stats?
