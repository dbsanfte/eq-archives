Agreed...Never fear in a Dungeon.  He must Darkness the mobs so that they
don't run far when they do decide to bug out on their own.

Cash from the Molars?  They're No Drop (unless you were letting others loot
for cash).  And the cash rate seems a little low.  I was grouped at level 9
with an enchanter (I was a 9th necro at the time) and we were easily pulling
a combined 100pp in 3 hours.  The weight was not a real issue.

Depending on his religion, He should be able to get to Dubious with the
guards in Paineel fairly quickly, and there's always a newbie running around
the garden that will open the gates for a few plat, so the banking and
selling should be no real problem.  He can also do the molar quest himself
(who cares about the Erudin faction?) and get to amiable very quickly.

Any way that he decides, the lack of armor should not be a problem as long
as the pet tanks and he heals when necessary.  Besides, with the Warrens,
almost everything in there is 15 or lower, except the named, and they only
range from 18 to about 24, or so.
