As far as the game is concerned, being in a guild means:

-You have a seperate chat channel for your members.
-You have your guild's name under your name for others to see.

All of the answers to the rest of your questions are up to the leaders
and members of the guild.  Some guilds require your full participation
in all scheduled events.  Some don't even schedule events.  Some are
huge 'raiding guilds' that get on several times each week and delve in
to the highest-end areas of the game, seeking the most "uber" items
ever seen, some not yet even discovered you will note.  Others despise
the thought of joining such a guild.  Your enjoyment and rewards for
joining a guild will vary by your own personality.  Most likely, there
are some guilds on your server that will best serve your interest and
attract the kind of players you want to group with and befriend.

As for your last question, do you need a guild...No.  You never need a
guild to play the game.  But you will find that after level 50 or so,
being guilded has many advantages.  Right now you can probably walk to
a number of zones, shout that you are LFG, and start killing.  Later
on you will find that you can't always find these pick up-groups.  You
will find that there are many places you want to go to get rare items
or good experience.  However, you can't simply show up and advertise
for a group, since there will be exactly zero other people in the zone
when you get there.  Also, you may find that you want to be in a
raiding guild.  These are often guilds for people who have a lot of
time to put in, and can afford to always be on when the guild says
they need to be on.  If you want to be one of the 1% of people on your
server with some item dropped by one of the most powerful creatures in
the game, you won't do it unguilded.

My suggestion is don't worry about a guild for right now unless you
get an invite from some good friend you make in the game.  Worry about
it when you hit 40 or 45.  And remember that if you join a guild and
find that you can't stand its policies or members, there are hundreds
of others to look at.
