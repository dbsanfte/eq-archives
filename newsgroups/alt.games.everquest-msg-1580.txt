Same here.

I've been playing since September, and until a week ago, I went LD
about once per month or so.  Now it is several times a day!  I've tried
tracert several times in the last week: no pings above 69ms, with the
highest being the terristhule.everquest.com server.  I'm pretty
confident it's not my school LAN connection which rates as equivalent
to a T1 by several measures.

Shrug.

I guess its just something that you have to accept for the time being;
the vagaries of online gaming are such that it is hard to prove who, if
anyone is at fault.
