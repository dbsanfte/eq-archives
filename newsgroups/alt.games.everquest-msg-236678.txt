I'm having a similar problem on a different quest.  I started doing the 
progressive fletching quest in Shar Vahl, and got the six xakra teeth in 
the bag, as instructed.  I then hit 'combine', and nothing happened.  I 
give the bag to the NPC, and he gives it right back.  Waiting on response 
from a petition at the moment as to what's going on.
