Hehe, I personally wouldnt object to one time 'for sale' posts, but
you're likely to get guff from anyone over anything in this group.

Anything over one trime though and you are really asking for trouble.

Put the item name and server in the header if you decide to be bold.

Dont pay much credence to eqprices and maxeq, I've often found them
grossly over optimistic on prices, and in one case, grossly
underpriced on the item I have for sale currently =)
