Err, please do elaborate on this "blocking" that I am doing?  Where and
when did I prevent you from finding more info or posting more on this
topic here in A.G.E.?  Rather, I encourage you to continue to seek out
info on the topic and was under the impression that you and I were in
fact having a discussion on that very same topic in this thread.  How
can that be construed as "blocking" you from anything?

If you mean stop responding with my opinions that disagree with yours,
then say so.  If you really feel that I am "blocking" you from something
then please state what that something is and what I can do to un"block"
you cause I am not here to get in your way.
