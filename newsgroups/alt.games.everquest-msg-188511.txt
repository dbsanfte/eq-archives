    Well, before you go for a Sony product, let me first relate a very short
story.

    During a [legal] item transfer between my main, a friend, and an alt,
four very expensive items vanished into the void when my machine crashed
during the final trade. These items took me nine hours to build up the cash
to buy. I immediately /petitioned, but, having realised I've not seen any
GM's on for a very long while and not having time to sit on my butt for 20
hours waiting for someone to respond, I sent a "GM contact" email to sony
asking for assistance in discovering where the items have gone, and the
possibility of recovering them.

    Four days later, I've yet to receive any response whatsoever.

Regards,
James
