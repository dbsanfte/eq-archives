	On your /disc hotkeys, put an empty /disc at the end.  That way as soon as
you hit them, you'll see the refresh time, even if you have to scroll back for
it later.  (If you really want to be devious, put /time as well....)

	Trueshot's refresh did go down ever so slightly during the brief period I
was 61.  No idea what (if anything) they did with other class' /discs.
