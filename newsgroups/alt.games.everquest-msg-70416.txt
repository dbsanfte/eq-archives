Monday, I went to Tenebrous with my level 55 necro and grouped with a
level 60 cleric (a guildmate) trying to Root-DoT coterie types. Got
smeared trying to do an unknown named who turned out to be immune to
root and snare. Fortunately, when grouped with an epic cleric, you can
try crazy shit like that. We eventually gave up on the main fort and
moved to an outpost. Found a no-wanderer spot, brought up a pet, and
commenced to root-dot. Once the cleric cast Aego on the pet, things
went a lot smoother. Unfortunately, after a half dozen pulls, DSL went
down and I had to spend an hour fixing that.

Logged back in after fixing it, gated to Shadowhaven, ran to Echo
Caverns and bought the 49- necro spells from the vendor behind the
secret wall. Coterie should got a LOT more smoothly when I can drop a
50% slow on them.

Ran my warrior from the tunnel where I had parked all of my characters
so as to switch equiptment between them back to Kunark. Then, I went
to sleep.
