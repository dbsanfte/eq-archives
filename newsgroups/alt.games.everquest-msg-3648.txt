I have used beg as a taunt many times. It works best with a low beg skill.
My magician has a beg over 80 now and the taunt aspect simply doesn't work
anymore. Remember, you have to click off auto-attack to use the skill and
then click it back on fast! Don't beg off of merchants and guards and
similar stuff. Beg off of summoned pets and any boat or raft in the game.
Yes it does raise your skill and it won't pay off. I remember getting my
first 3cp with a beg skill of 110 and now I'm up to gold with it. It takes
forever but my necro had time to kill while medding. Yes it is worth the
time if you know you will play the character a long time. Free cash adds up
quickly, especially when you might have bad faction at your local city and
can't get in to the bank. Go to a green NPC and beg like crazy. After about
five minutes I can get two or three plat and may not even have to have my
pet kill it if it attacks me. All skills have uses in the game. Some more
than others. Getting bored with the game from constant soloing or camping
the same gnoll and orcs for days? Take your cash and try tailoring or
brewing. You will get hooked on some trade skill and then go questing for
components. You might even find more uses for all these skills in your
travels.
