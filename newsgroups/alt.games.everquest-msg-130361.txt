Ok, I'd like to know how you do that =0P.. you say you have crappy
equipement.. My shaman was the first character I made, so I left off 10
wisdom from him when I created him (I didn't know!).  Anyways, how do you
solo in DL with only a bubble of mana?  If you were exagerating, ok, but if
you weren't, I need to know.. my slow spell almost takes a bubble of mana
=0P.
