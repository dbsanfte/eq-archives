Quid Rilstone (lvl 35 pally, rare-ish spawn) in rathe mtns. drops the
syrin hair hood. The hood is the common drop (rare is a weapon) and the
stats are 5ac 12chr 10fire, if I'm remembering right. I camped him for
my chanter; but it was kind of a pain. I spent 3 or 4 hours slaughtering
greens to get him to spawn. The easier solution is to buy player made
cat's eye jewelry. You can get golden cat's eye bracelets (7chr) for
next to nothing and a plat or velium cat's eye neck or star ruby veil
(10 or 12 chr, depending on which metal you go with.)
