I am thrilled to see that Druids (and I assume other classes that get hit
with begging) can finally stand up for themselves and not be judged as
inconsiderate.

If you have followed the "Arrogant Druids" posts so far, you are probably
familiar with my stance... I don't know you, you want something from me,
It's up to me whether that is a bother or not.

I just wanted to post this example to show... I don't always say no.

Last night while goofing off in Rivervale... not doing anything at all
really... I got a /tell "pardon me, but is there anyway you could port me to
SRO? I'm a troll and stuck here in Misty thicket" Did a /who on him... 11th
Troll Warrior. I respond "sure thing" and head his way.

I find him, SoW him (as is my custom before any port) Port him to SRO and
give him a couple of buffs. He puts 2pp up in the trade window, and I say
"there is no need, but I appreciate the sentiment"
