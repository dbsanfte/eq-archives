this was a bug on all servers right after shared bank went live, I dont
think you could drop it on the ground or hand it to someone, but you could
move nodrops between chars on your account by sticking them in a bag and
putting it in shared bank slot.

----
as far as number 1: thats one of the bogus reasons people give to people who
ask why the server is down. (like saying a GM accidentally spawned a dragon
in bazaar or pok and its killing everyone)


far as number 3, dunno about that. I dont play on fv so dunno how dupes
there work, and ive never really looked into how to do things that could get
my account banned anyways.
