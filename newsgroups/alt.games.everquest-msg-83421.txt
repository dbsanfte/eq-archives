Did you read what I wrote?  The person who has my account info also has 
the keys to my apartment.  I have literally 10s of thousands of dollars 
of electronics there, and no doorman.  If I can't trust that person with 
my fucking virtual avatar in a game, why in the fuck would I trust them 
with my house.  That same person also gets to borrow my car when he needs 
to get out of NYC for a couple days.  I also have keys to his apartment, 
and his account info.  He is my GM, and I've known him for 20+ years.

I do computer security for a Fortune 500 company.  I'm very aware of the 
issues with securing passwords.  Before this I ran the backbone network 
for regional and national ISPs, and then ran the hosting infrastructure.  
I am more aware of computer security than you will ever be.  

> Who stole all your shit and got your account banned?
> SOMEONE HACKED ME!!!!! DAMN YOU FUKIN VONART!!!!

Why in the hell would I do that?  I know the risk I'm taking, and I know 
that if my GM were to snap and sell all my stuff, I would take my lumps, 
and re-aquire my gear.  I play enough that I'm not going to have a corpse 
rot on me, most of my gear is no-drop, and I have an entire CR setup in 
the bank.  
I also completely believe in taking responsibility for your own actions, 
so the last thing I would do would be to blame Verant, unless I know it 
was their issue.  (Just as an aside, I know every IP address that I have 
connected from in the past 10 months.  If there were an issue, I could 
provide a list to Verant and they could compare it to their logs, and I 
would have a place to start looking.  If I need to give access to my 
account for a short period for time for an MQ or something, I'm smart 
enough to change my password and then change it back.

I can say the same thing, except that I actually do computer security for 
a living.  Before Radius and TACACS were common, it was almost impossible 
to provide unique login for most networking devices, so you learned to 
hire only people you could trust, and monitor who logged on through 
different means.  It certainly didn't prevent you from having 20 people 
logging onto your backbone routers, yet we someone figured out ways to 
make it work.  

Finally, all these horror stories I read make me think that you really 
believe you can't trust anyone.  I did my time in the military, and 
literally trusted my life to people, I do my time in the corporate 
sector, and I trust my career to my co-workers.  I live in a very 
expensive city, and have some nice toys.  My roommate, girlfriend, and 
several long-time friends have access to my apartment, and therefore my 
car keys, checkbooks, credit-cards, etc.  I value these items much more 
than anything in EQ, and I value my friends much more than all those 
items put together.  
Go through life not trusting anyone.  Never have any friends.  Maybe the 
reason that you don't have anyone you trust enough is that your a 
paranoid nutcase, or maybe you just need to pick better friends.  My 
guild will probably never be a true Uber-guild, because we're too 
selective in who we allow to join.  We're generally mid-20s to mid-30s 
professionals or military members, with a couple college students thrown 
in.  Almost everyone in the guild is RL friends with several other 
people, and folks road-trip to visit.  We are much more of an on-line 
community than some random collection of idiots who happen to be the same 
level and play at the same times.  I suspect that if you look at almost 
all of the truly powerful guilds though, you'll find that the discipline 
required to get to that level is a pretty good idiot filter.  Sure there 
are some exceptions, but for all the bitching I've seen about gear being 
stolen or whatnot, it's never from a top raiding guild, but rather from 
some fuckwad in a piece-of-shit griefer guild.  On Innoruuk it's ALWAYS 
the fucks from DoW or their various permutations, and I just chalk it up 
to the idiot tax.
