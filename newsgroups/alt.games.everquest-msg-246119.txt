Clerics aren't supposed to add to dps? Damn, I've been playing mine wrong
then! I always add to dps, either with my nukes, my mark of retribution, or
my dot if it's undead, and then of course there's my Flying Hammer of Doom
(aka Unswerving Hammer of Faith). And that's not counting the times I'm out
there swinging away with my pile driver and bashing with my
shield...granted, in the above scenario I'd probably not be in the melee,
but no reason my pet hammer and my spells can't add to the dps. :) I do
realize you're also talking about 2-boxing, which I've never done, so I
imagine it would be difficult to maintain dps from what's basically a bot on
the second computer...

On a side note, I did do the enchanter/cleric duo with a friend in PoN; he
enchanted one of the big spiders, and it made me feel really good to max out
my complete heal on his pet (7500 hps) and still not completely heal the
spider. I only rooted once when the charm broke, however, because he
recharmed it so quickly, it was pointless for me to root.
