> Since when is the subway the "designated area" for kids to do graffiti?

I didnt say that AT ALL.
Someone saying racist guff in the relevant newsgroup is the same as a bunch
of kids doing graffiti in a deisgnated area.
Someone coming onto a newsgroup about Sega and spouting racist rubbish is
the same as the kids doing graffiti in the subway.

I didnt say that they DID carry them all.  But for you to put on your big
hat, and say that no one else who uses Cox can use that service is
unwarranted.

Covered it?  No, I dont think so.
Oh, you mean your silly little assumption that just because another Cox user
may use that group, it looks bad on you?  That wasnt 'covering it', that was
your paranoid rubbish.

So then why are you so worried about that group then, if such Worldly
Matters should come first?

And they are entitled to use what newsgroups the ISP gives them.  They are
also entitled to not want to have netcops running around deciding what
groups they should be using.

Well, I think religion is all rubbish anyway - but I am not asking Blue
Yonder to take down all the alt.religion groups, as I have my priorities in
order, and dont wish to ruin things for other Blue Yonder users.
