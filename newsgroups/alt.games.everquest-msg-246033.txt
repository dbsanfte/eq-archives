From your caster point of view, no it wasn't necessary. But this wasn't for
casters specifically, it was for melee, so quit bitching.

One of the few things left that was a monk only ability, my monk is a tad
peeved at that too, but I'm not going to whine about it. One of my fave
things is to bind the shaman during med breaks - this will speed the killing
process up nicely.

My beastlord is very happy with the deal, seeing as at 26 he's healing for
33 hp a bandage, or the same as his light healing. Lots more mana available
then for useful stuff. He's quite happy fighting at the 50% mark anyway, so
it's all a bonus.

Anything that reduces downtime is good in my book. I can see necros and
shamans having a whale of a time with this one - there was never an excuse
to be oom with those classes, now even poor players can have zero downtime.
