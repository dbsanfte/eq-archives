And the reason its not worth the trouble is because farmers have
depressed the prices to the point where its always better to get exp to
level up and buy them, or farm them yourself.

If, at a given level, you have a tradeoff between loot and exp, then
different people will make that tradeoff differently, and you will have
a choice as to what to do.

On the other hand, if the only thing of any value is exp, then everyone
will be packed into the zones with the most reliable exp, bitching about
how crowded it is and how bored they are.
