As a bard, I use charm over mez... it has 2 big advantages.
1) It atacks the other monster for extra damage (duh)
2) It cant be broken by idiot party members attacking it, like mez.

Sounds like that bard was nuts. Hes better off using his playing time or
mana song, anthem or some other party helping spell. Chanter mez lasts
longer too.
