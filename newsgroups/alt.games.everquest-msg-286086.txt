Well, my information is second-hand (I'm a WoW widower), and I admit
my wife -- er, information source -- does do high-end raiding, but
she also enjoys story-line quests and such, and what she's saying is
that the TBC content is good, but it involves enough tedious steps
that she's not at all sure she wants to level up more than one
character through it.  (And she has bunches and bunches.)

Of course, EQ is evidence that some players are willing to grind
faction and such, so it's not a deathknell by any means, but from
her descriptions it sounds like the content in TBC didn't have
nearly the "replay" value of the original.  If so (and my sample
size is small :-), it suggests that WoW may be starting down the
same path EQ did, where players mow through each expansion and end
up looking for more, forcing a progression of ever-flimsier add-ons
because there's not really enough new content in any of them to keep
the existing players happy for long.
