Oh, it's hardly new that spells can be used for grief play, even
unintentionally. I once had a wizard (level 55, in Chardok, lfg and
refused to believe teaming up with a root/dotter would be
counterproductive till I showed her) throw little nukes on my parked
mobs, to 'help' - she got me a couple extra smacks while I reparked my
pull. Someone with a better snare than mine (pre epic) could snare my
mob, the new snare could wear off and I wouldn't get a message. My
level 11 cleric was meeting up with someone for a sale and fighting a
lion. The rogue shows up, sees her fighting, backstabs lion and gets
kill on what was an almost half dead blue mob for my cleric. 
I could run into a mid 20s zone, sneak around a group and cast
wildfire on all their pulls. I could charm a bear, buff it to the hilt
and set it loose. I could run up to someone root/dotting and cast
nullify magic on their pull, or run up to a group with mezzed adds and
dot all their mobs. I could root an extra mob in the middle of another
group's camp. I could cast sow on a bard :)

The game works because most people have the common sense not to pull
that kind of shit, and griefing with cancel magic is no different than
griefing with other spells.
