I'm introducing another friend to EQ and we want to PL her chanter so she
can group with the rest of us. We want to get her up to level 24 asap.

What is some good gear that we can either loot easily or buy for relatively
cheap in the bazaar?

I've got a 57 cleric and 32 SK so relatively cheap means I'm willing to lay
out up to 100pp per item if its really good. Cheaper is better. Also
anything thats really good for chanters that the cleric or SK can hunt alone
or together without really long camps would be nice -- I'd rather save the
plat if I can. :-)
