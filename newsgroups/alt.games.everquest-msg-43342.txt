yep, my massive letter writing campaign paid off I guess!

Band aid solutions to undesireable sometime happenings do not work.
Overall higher level players do not swoop down on the mobs lower level
people are camping to swipe the kill and the loot so the way to
prevent it from happening once in a great while is not to prevent high
levels from getting various loot when no one else is or
factions/quests which are really CONTENT. If you eliminate most of the
content for the only character I really want to play in luclin, I may
as well be playing AO ;)

There is just a point where you can't "make the game better" when its
so bad by design by breaking things you are free to do. Static loot
and semi static random drops from X mob causes the problem, not higher
level players being able to loot so a band-aid is just not an
improvement. Taking away the freedom of a large number of characters
is not really going to improve the game at all for lower level ones. 

I bet the majority of players in favor of the trivial combat code
could not even name circumstances from the past in which the game
would have been improved for them if the code existed. Sometimes they
incorrectly think of such circumstances like how they think it would
affect the AC in OOT which is STILL blue to my level 55, so nothing
would change at all.
