    The one and only reason Raiders attempt content above what my groups do,
is that you can get TO it, and we can't.

    We'll attempt everything we can get close enough to. We'll fail more
often though, because our gear, which took us as long to get as yours did,
isn't anywhere near as good.

    I know you'd like to believe that you're also more skilled, but you're
not - taking out content far above you with shitty gear is a specialty we've
spent our entire lives on. If you tried to pull off half the crap we get up
to with OUR gear, you would wipe, wipe and wipe. Same as we would with your
gear trying high-level raid encounters.

    Or six people spending 33 hours to get four drops? We already spend that
in LDoN or other camps for drops that aren't even CLOSE to what you get on
that 4 hour raid. I would happily have spent weeks obtaining a single piece
of elemental quality gear when PoP came out. I think you're making some
pretty sad assumptions about non-raiders. Trying to get *anywhere* in this
game without Raid gear takes an absolute bucketload of committment and
skill, and we would eat burning coals if it would gain us gear even remotely
comparible with yours.

    Shit, if you can sell Sony on "equivalent rewards for hours spent
grouping or raiding" I'll never raid ever again! We're not even close to
asking that. Without a doubt most non-uberguilders would sell their souls to
put in 2x the effort for yesterday's raid gear.
