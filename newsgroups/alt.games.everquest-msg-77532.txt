yeah the ataritimes in your email address kinda takes me back. I
remember on the lowly grandaddy atari 2600 how games like Space
Invaders and warlords were really as good as they had to be and still
hold up well today. Gameplay was only hurt (along with graphics) when
they got big headed and tried to make games which were too complex for
the 2600.
