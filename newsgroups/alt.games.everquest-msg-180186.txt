No, just felt it was too pathetic to even bother with. But, if you
insist on wasting time grasping at straws in a weak attempt to save
face (which is backfiring horribly, by the way)...

The fantasy world is all about stereotypes in many ways. While there
are white martial artists, they certainly aren't the majority and they
definately didn't originate it. (Not saying asians invented hand to
hand combat, just that they were the first to refine it to the degree
of an "art") There are asian inspirations in the human monk guilds
beyond just the fighting style as well.

Now, I find it amusing that you accuse someone you've never seen
before of being racist against asians and blacks over something so
vague. Are you sure that I'm white?
