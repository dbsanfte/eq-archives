Is it that you don't know, or don't care that you're offering total
strangers the ability to /guildinvite and /guildremove anyone, at any time
totally anonymously to you?

Your guild has young characters in it.  It'll grow just fine if you really
get to know the people you're making officers, making sure they're worthy of
representing YOU.

Make NO mistake here:  when someone is an asshole I do a /guildstatus on
them.  If they are a member I hunt down the leader or officer.  If they're
an officer I write off that guild as total losers.  I'm not alone.

Your guild will fail if you don't care who the officers are.
