I was all with you up until here. Unless you are busy and really in the
middle of something, juggling /tells, or in some other way indisposed and/or
would be greatly inconvenienced to have to type, I think not responding to
/tells is rude. It's like staring blankly at somebody who just asked you the
time ... rude.

At the very least, I will respond politely to the first /tell I get. "No
thanks, I'm soloing today" or some other such response. Now, after the
first, many don't seem to get the message. Then I'm all with you. But
responding to that first /tell is the same courtesy you talk about, in my
opinion.
