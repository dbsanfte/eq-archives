No expense is necessary.  You know that coins disappear into the same void
that they do when 'paid' to an NPC merchant.  Want to know if items remain
in bags when given to a mob?  Find an NPC merchant that does not have a full
inventory, like on patch day when the servers come back up.  Put a rusty
short sword in a small bag and 'sell' it to the merchant.  Check the
merchant inventory to see if the small bag and the rusty short sword are
listed separately.  If not, buy the small bag from the merchant (a few gp)
and see if the rusty short sword remains inside.

However it works on a merchant, it will work on a mob... I think.  It's all
an educated guess.
