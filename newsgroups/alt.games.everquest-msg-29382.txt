The approach I took was to scan for "Hail soandso" and use it as a trigger
to tell me any NPCs to look for.

I also had to look at the time of anything you said, and then grab anything
that any NPC said within the next 2 seconds.

Then there were the emotes, where you'd give the trigger phrase, and the NPC
would do something like "Soandso sighs wistfully.  'Ah, yes, if I only had a
[fire beetle eye]."

I then had to make it so that if you grabbed anything that an NPC said,
anything they said in your hearing at any time in the future would get
grabbed too, because sometimes you just hand stuff in, and then they say
things.

With all that, I was getting a LOT of false positives.  You'd say something
in town, and a guard would at that moment say something and attack a moss
snake.

It just wasn't working as well as I'd like.
