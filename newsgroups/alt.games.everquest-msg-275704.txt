My vote goes for Shadowknight.
I had a 65 SK friend who was soloing all day the lower depths of
Sebilis,teaming up with him with my at that time 65 Ranger actually
slowed him down,cause FD was no longer possible,and all the adds
down there exhausted us,even at 65 with around 200 AAs.
He was the richest player I know from all the Fungi Tunics. :)
I think most classes would have a hard time staying alive solo in
Dungeons,not so Shadowknights.
