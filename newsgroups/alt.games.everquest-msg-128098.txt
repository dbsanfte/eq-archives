Reading this, another possibility struck me as being more plausible than
a necro running from a blue mob for no reason, then arguing about it.

You he brought an Initiate into camp which you saw.

He snared it so you could run away.

Give him the benefit of the doubt for 1 second and look below

Or maybe, just maybe, when he pulled, he got BOTH an initiate AND an
annalkeeper. He told you to run, but you cast on the first mob you saw.
He came back and snared it for you to run away, and luckily the (snared)
annulkeeper never got close enough to agro you.

Not saying that's what *did* happen, just that it's a plausible
scenario, and explains the other guy's running away from a blue mob, and
insistence it was an annalkeeper. He cast on it, therefore it'd be on
his target, and a rather hard confusion to make. Something obviously
killed him while you were killing the initiate after all

It could've happened the way you thought, but basic rule of thumb is
that if your puller tells you to run, you run. He knows much better than
you what he's training into camp, and if he's hightailing it to the
guards with several mobs on his tail, there don't expect him to stay and
help.

If buffs were cast on you, you'll probably have them up when you log
back in.

If you can't win a fight (ie: too many/high level adds) surely it's not
cowardice to run away to fight another day?
