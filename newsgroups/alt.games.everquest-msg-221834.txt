I dont think you can truely revert you can always see the original
colour of the item on the left and set it to that, that may then mean
you take on the default colours when you put the next item, or it may
mean everything is now changed to that colour. Holding your mouse over
the left hand colour gives you the RGB value.

Some armors dont colour well, some dont colour at all, others are
always tinted. You just have to fiddle and only actually apply when
you're ready.
