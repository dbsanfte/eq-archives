One quick piece of advice: If you ever decide to run a Necromancer, Iksar is
the way to go. Necros are hated everywhere, anyway, so who cares about the
fact everyone hates Necros? Plus, the Iksar regen makes the Necro spells
that convert health to mana easier to deal with.

(Dark Elf, if you DON'T want to be hated by everyone and plan on using the
health to mana spells for casting Lifetap spells only.....)
