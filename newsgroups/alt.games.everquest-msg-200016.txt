Nice little omission there with the pumped up regen.   It isn't just a
"clarity".  It's much more.  Actually, I remember people breezing for
donations as well.

I remember chanters from the very start.   Funny how your server had
such a shortage.  Yea, they sucked in the beginning levels and I
imagine they still do.

Anyone want to powerlevel a Chanter on Ayonae Ro?  Get me to level 60,
and I'll never sell KEI.  I'll freely give it away in all of the
popular areas in my spare time.   That would sure be pissing in the
KEI box of Wheaties... wouldn't it?  (I'm serious too)
