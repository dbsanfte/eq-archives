I believe it supports DirectX 8.1 but does not fully support all ofthe 
DirectX instructions that a card with vertex and pixel shaders does.  I'm 
using the MX card and have had no problems, but I do wish I'd known that it 
wasn't a true Geforce 4, I'd have saved my money and bought a real one or 
bought the Geforce 3.
