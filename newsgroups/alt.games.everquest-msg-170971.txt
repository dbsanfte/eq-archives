I'd have to agree with you there... Clinton bombed Iraq to avoid being
impeached, at least that's my opinion.

Erm... so (assuming you're a voter) you think "said brawl" is ok because you
tolerate it?  Maybe we (as voters) should consider voting for the
non-brawlers.  Problem is that humanity is stupid.  Most people are sheep
(no offense to those who aren't).  They will follow the most titillating
candidate, usually.  On the other hand, the system works remarkably well
despite that, and even though most politicians are bastards, they usually do
exactly what the people want, since otherwise their career is ended.  It's
somewhat ironic that the politicians, whose job is based on their ability to
lead sheep around by their noses, will lose that job unless they let the
sheep lead them around by the nose once they get the job.

*Gags* Eh... scuse me, your statement kind of took me by surprise.  Erm...
please enlighten me as to how "judeochristians and monotheists" have fewer
rights than anyone else?

Wow.  I'm amazed you didn't mention me.  Seems like you found me remarkably
uncivil... But hey, I'm flattered!  (I guess)

The only thing that can be said about capitalism is it's the lesser of
several evils.  There is no other economic system (as far as I can tell)
that works as well.  Also, I like the fact that capitalism involves less
interference by the government than other systems.  But you can't seriously
argue that capitalism is a perfect, or even exemplary, system.

You know, I don't want to criticize or anything, but I don't understand how
so many people can say "I'm a Republican" or "Democrat" or "right-winger" or
"left-winger".  I would hate to think my beliefs are defined by the group
whose beliefs I hold.  I simply believe what makes sense to me.  I think I
could be labeled according to my position in a political group but... the
problem I see here is that the "conservatives" end up taking blame for and
defending the actions of other "conservatives" and "liberals" end up taking
blame for and defending the actions of other "liberals".  I much prefer to
have my own beliefs and taking consequences for my beliefs and actions only.
For example, I don't like Clinton or Bush (though I think both did some good
things).  I've seen people's eyes bug out when I say that -- "But which side
are you on?!"  Erm... I'm not on either side.  If a politician does
something I like, I respect that.  If the same person does something I
disagree with, under no circumstances do I feel obliged to defend them.
But... to each his own, I guess.
