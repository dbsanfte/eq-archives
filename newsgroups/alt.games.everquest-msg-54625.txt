I thought I had these saved, but I somehow have lost them.
Quite sometime ago there was a post about how Necro's aren't
really that bad.  That it was the enchanter that was truly evil.

Also, there was one about a wife/girlfriend killing the computer
when the husband/boyfriend didn't shutoff EQ. It was told like an
EQ session.

I think I even reposted these once, but just cant find them.  Anyone
still have these.
