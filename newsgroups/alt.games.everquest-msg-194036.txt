Neither.

Get this robe instead:

Green Silken Drape  +8 AC +9 Sta +9 Dex +3 Int +15 vsPos +3.50 Wt
Affliction Haste II

Unless you already have an affliction haste item.
The Necros DoTs have very long cast times, anything to shave a few seconds
is worth it.

Focus items are paramount for casters these days.
