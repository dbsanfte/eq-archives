Here's an idea I had, while trying to figure out where the heck the people I
know from EQ1, and where various people I know in RL, ended up in EQ2 and in
WoW.  (I can't really take credit for this, as I see that someone else also
had this idea, and posted to the FoH boards, so although we seem to have
thought of it around the same time, he published first :-)).

For the first week or two, allow free, automated, server transfers.
(Probably best to limit them to, say, one per day per character or per
account).  The idea here is that people could then get into the game without
worrying about where their friends are playing.
