640K ought to be more than enough for anybody!
Who would ever want to exit from Windows? (the original version of Windows
didn't have an exit option)

Thank the Gods this guy can't actually code and just orders people what he
wants things to look like. Too bad they don't have the guts to tell him that
he's wring.

Remember, he never did give that guy the full $5000 for MS-DOS.

To tell you the truth I'm surprised about the 512MB issue, you'd think
they'd have learned their lesson. No other OS in the history of the PC has
had this issue. Of course, until fairly recently, they have all had a hard
drive limiting issue, interfered with getting Linux to dual boot on my
12Gig.

OK, that's it for my MS bashing for the weekend, I promise. I won't even
bring it up in guild chat or at the dinner table. Unless my father complains
about another WinXP problem. ;)
