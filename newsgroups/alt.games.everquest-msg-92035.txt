There has been talk of a potential memory leak in the EQ client for some time
now.  While I personally have not experienced this, it is certainly not outside
the realm of possibilities.

There are some utilities that track the amount of free memory on your system
and can log this.  You may be interested in trying one of these out.

If there is a memory leak, there is little you can do.  VI would have to patch
it up.

Hope this helps.
