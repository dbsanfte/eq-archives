Lonely Guy and for those that can be salvaged:

See what I mean?

Their words and actions prove my point about EQ.  You want to associate
yourself with these kinds of people?  These people will pull you down and
put you into a deeper hole.  Get outta there!  The ship is going to sink.
Save yourself while you can.  Don't ever play EQ.

BTW, I am speaking from 2 hardcore years of EQ experience and just stopped
by here to see if anything has changed.  The only difference now is that EQ
has become a greater and more expensive time sink but the people are still
the same.
