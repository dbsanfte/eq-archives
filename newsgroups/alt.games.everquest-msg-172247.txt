The easy cure for this would be for everyone to actually USE the LFG tag when
LFG.  This would require no coding at all, the LFG tag is already in the game.

I get tells all the time "are you looking for a group?"  I tend to answer
politely, since I do enjoy pickup groups and these are people who actively seek
out other players for groups, not what I want to alienate.

But what I -want- to say is "do you see the LFG flag on me, idiot?"

If my LFG flag isn't up, then no, I'm not LFG.  I'm asking in guild to see if
there's a raid, or a guild group forming, or I'm busy doing a quest, or chatting
with a friend, or doing a transfer, or on a CR, or... well there are a lot of
things I might be doing, but LFG isn't one of them, because there's a flag I can
set when I am!

Sadly, 90% of the population doesn't seem to use the LFG flag, so people can't
legitimately be expected to make that assumption.

When I'm looking for people to fill out my groups, you can bet that anyone who
is more or less appropriate for the slot with an LFG flag gets the first call.
Only when I've exhausted all LFG options do I even look for non LFG people who
seem to be in zones where they might be ungrouped.  I notice much the same
practice among people I group with, so presumably I do get rewarded for putting
the flag up.

A "not LFG" flag as you suggest would be handy, since despite my hopes, people
DO still send tells if the flag isnt' up, just as I do.

I'd also like to see the LFG flag not suspend itself just because I'm grouped.
Group of two is still possibly LFG.  Or how about a LFM flag, for Looking for
Members?.... better make that Looking for More cause members might be seen as
off color :)
