First one, the gateway, the RAM shouldn't be proprietary...I'm pretty sure
I've upgraded some here at work.  Most RAM sellers do mention which of their
products you need, so if they're a little different, they should sell it.

As to the IBM, no clue.  IBM to me has always meant lot$ of ca$h, not
reliability (no idea if they're reliable...my laptop was good).

Win98SE at 512MB works just fine.  I have 2 computers doing it.

Video WILL have to be upgraded.   I often buy my stuff from CDW and they
have a GeForce2MX 400 (64MB) for $82
(http://www.cdw.com/shop/products/default.asp?EDC=320769) but someone else
claimed they saw it elsewhere for $55.  Obviously if you're going to buy a
couple of video cards you should shop around. :)

Installing it on the Gateway shouldn't be a problem.  On the IBM, no idea,
but one would hope it'd be easy.

As to RAM, I'd check out www.kingston.com and go through their little RAM
database.  I couldn't find anything about your IBM (choose ALL IBM memory to
see a full list of PC models, maybe I missed yours).  I had a little better
luck with your Gateway but it didn't list "GP" specifically.  If GP stands
for something, or you have the part numbers for either computer, that might
be a much faster way of looking it up there.
