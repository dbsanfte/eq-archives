But it should not be that way.  LFG flag on should be all you need, since
its easy to /who all LFG (class) (level range).  We know that 95% of the
high level players have all the expansions, so the only question becomes
"are you flagged/keyed for whatever zone we are wanting to go to".

This question could easily be answered via the new LFG window, go in there
and supply the information as to which zones you can go to/are interested
in.

At the same time, groups can go in and enter qualities they are looking for,
so that they need not constantly be on the lookout for new people popping up
that might fit in.

But easily 66% of the time, what gets you into a group is going to the zone
you want to fight in, or to POT, POK, Nexus, and using OOC LFG.

Why?  Perhaps you are right, noone wants someone who thinks they can get
into a group just by turning on their flag and going about their business,
assured that anyone needing someone of their description will use a who and
find them.  But I think its really because most people are too damn lazy or
ignorant to look, rather than deliberately shunning the people with the flag
on.

Would you really want to settle for a 46 chanter as your slower, if you knew
that two zones away was a 56 shaman LFG?  Without the LFG flag, you'll never
know about that shaman, and you'll have to take the chanter or keep looking
just because he's the only slower advertising in your zone.

While only about a third of the invites I've recieved come from LFG flag,
about 66% of the invites I've given come from that, because when I need
someone, I take a look rather than just idly waiting for someone to show up
in zone and advertize.  In fact the number would be higher still, except
that I do also look at people who /ooc in the zone I'm in, flag or no flag,
and in desperation will ask level and class appropriate people who are in
POK/Nexus/POT that I've found by doing a who all search.. Figure nobody in
those three zones is fighting anything, so -might- be LFG with flag off.
The frequency with which this last tactic works tells me that not nearly
enough people use the flag!

I also submit that response to the LFG flag -is- a good indicator of how
desireable a class is.  Yes, LFG doesn't work as well as you might hope.
But it sucks equally for all classes, so remove that from the equation.
Assuming a 10 level 54 members of each class are sitting in POT with their
flags on for an hour (not advertising, not putting together their own
groups, doing nothing but sit and respond to tells), looking at how many of
each class are left at the end of that time would I think be very
interesting indeed.

On a less rigorous scale, I can tell you that as my bard hit certain
critical song levels his number of invites increased dramatically.  I can
also tell you that my shaman has recieved more invites going from 46 to 51
in POP than my bard ever did going from 46 to 57.  Since both are engaging
in the same plan of turning LFG on and going ahead and soloing while
waiting, this seems a pretty clear indicator to me that shaman are more
desired... especially when you consider that there is rarely any bard
competition, but very often more shaman hanging about also LFG.
