This is what happens when you forget to type "enter"
to start a new message.

Because you're still in "command" mode, not message mode,
the first "t" is taken as the "tell" command, and
thus the rest of what you type ("hanks") is
interpreted as who you're tryign to send a tell to.
When you hit enter at the end of that, the game
says, "hey, I can't send a tell to 'hanks', there's
no one online by that name".
