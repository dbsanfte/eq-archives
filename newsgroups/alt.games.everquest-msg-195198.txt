Hm, a couple of instances ? Just a few examples of the last half year ...
lag-problems (bugfix after about 2 weeks ?) including lds, bazaarcrashing
(dont think its fixed completely yet), crashing to desktop while zoning,
pathingproblems with mobs not reachable by players, 1018-errors, zoneinlag
from other players (not fixed yet even after we have been told so) ect
ect... If thats not enough please write me so i can continue on the list ...
but like I said "get used to it" (I did). He asked a question and I told him
my experiences (yes i have played now for couple of years too). These are
all confirmed bugs by SOE, no fantasy ...


>It's the nature of software changes/upgrades/fixes of this magnitude.


Ok, thats the old question/discussion ... Why not testing it and solving the
hardwareindependent problems that ALL will have before bringing to server ?
The final softwaretransmission wont take 6 hours (dont think they use a 14.4
modem on a dialup) ...

Fully agree ... Dont think you only should play a char because of advantages
but playing because of fun you could/should have ... But each class has a
few strategies/advantages for itself ... thats what makes it special and fun
to play different ones ... But if it will make the fight against single mobs
nearly impossible (in my opinion you should decide on your own if you want
to solo or not) and your classpecific strategies ect wont work anymore its
not that funny. Just a few examples : enchanter charm (ok, you are fully
right, was a bit too overpowered), ranger, bard (try to get your charm stick
now ...), monk ....
I know a lot of changes have been necessary but they have overdone some in
my opinion ... They really unbalance gameplay in my opinion (ok, I dont play
the mosthated class in game : druids)... If you know before you even start a
char that you wont be able to do serious damage, wont get decent AC and your
spells are more than weak you wont play it ...
Every class should have their own advantages (sure with disadvantages) ...
its all about balance ...

>just tend to blow it out of proportion due to sheer frustration.

I am not frustrated or want to get him off the game ... He asked a question
and here is my answer again :

GET USED TO IT


Have fun in game
