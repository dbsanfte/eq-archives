A vindi probably isn't all that useful to a warrior (compared to some
of the others out there) but there's other classes that get a lot out
of a vindi. Shaman are probably the best example (also bards I think).
For a shaman there just isn't anything out there close to a vindi
(except a wicked mail) that's remotely as easy to get.
