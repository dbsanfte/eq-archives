Wow, no amplification for Largo's Assonant Binding?  That is not meant
to be a rip at all, I just find it interesting how unique bard styles
of play really are.  This was my song lineup last night and I was
doing the hasting and slowing.  For those who don't know what the
songs do I'll add it in parenthesis.

1. Amplification (bonus to "Singing" based songs)
2. Largo's Assonant Binding (snare/slow)
3. Verses of Victory (Haste, STR, AGI, AC)
4. Battlecry of the Vah Shir (Haste that stacks on to other haste
songs/spells)
5. Nillipus March of the Wee (AC, AGI, Dmg absorb)
6. Cantana of Replenishment (Mana & Health regen)
7. Song of Twilight (mez)
8. Kelin's Lugubrious Lament (Lull)

That was just for last night.  I usually favor McVaxious Rousing Rondo
over Verses of Victory but we had someone in our group providing a
damage shield so I ditched it in favor of the higher haste percentage.
 Plus, Verses of Victory is also a "Singing" based song so
Amplification kicks up the haste to at least 45%

Well done.  If I had Occlusion of Sound I'd pull with that but I
normally do the same thing.

Ahh, now I understand why the particular spell lineup.

Heh, for twisting I use 1-5.  The rest of the songs I click the gems. 
:o)  Probably not the most efficient but after such a long time I
really works for me.

I have tried many different classes and I just can't seem to stay away
from the Bard.  Bards are great at soloing and very useful in grouping
situations.
