I was under the impression that agro kiting was alittle different then
that. That doesn't really seem to be kiting at all to me. Seems more
like love level help yer pet so he don't die stuff.
I have a 35 necro so here is what he does some times that maybe known
as agro kiting.

1. drink up a sow potion.
2. Darknessa mob to snare and pull to pet while piling on the dots.
3. when it finally gets to pet pet attack.
4. mob looks at pet and laughs and keeps running for me.
5. pile on more sots and run like a little girl.
6. loot mob after pet finishes beating on his back.

I think that is agro kiting but let me know if I'm wrong. 

This form if kiting is rather fun in GD btw... fear kiting is ok but
have to chase the mobs into possible agro and then opps FD again! LOL,
I'd gladly pay fer a sow potion and do this way as opposed to fear
kite... then again my main is a druid so this way is probably just
habit.
