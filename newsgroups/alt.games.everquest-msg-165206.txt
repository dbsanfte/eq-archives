You either phrased that very badly, or you are wrong.  I can't tell which.
:-)

I *think* what you are trying to say is that each spawn is independent.
That is, the probability that the AC will spawn *this* time doesn't depend
on what the last 1 or 2 or 100 spawns were.  That's correct.

However, a person planning their day who sets aside 10 hours for AC camping
is *way* more likely to get the AC that day than someone who sets aside 30
for the camp.
