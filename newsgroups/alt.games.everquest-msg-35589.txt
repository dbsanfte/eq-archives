Subject: Level 8 Bard Spell Kelins Lugubrious Lament

I have a level 8 bard.  I dinged 8 in Western Commons.  I ran to Freeport to
get my practice and my new bard spell.  To my dismay the vendors at the Bard
guild did not have Kelin's Lugubrious Lament.  So, I undertook the long journey
to Qeynos.  I was attacked by gnolls and wolves, but out ran them all.

Imagine my horror when I found that the vendors in Qeynos also didn't carry
that song!  

Can some kind person reading this post give me advice as to where I can get
this song?  I have been saving my money and really want it.
