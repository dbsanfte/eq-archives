I hated DL and one group was enough for me.  I don't expect KC to be any
different, so I doubt I'll ever group there.

I guess I'm the odd man out, because I'm not twinked.  I bought
everything I own from cash I earned either fighting or selling in the
bazaar.  I assure you, if I were twinked, I would have bought myself
better weapons. :-)

Actually, I'm at about 925 AC unbuffed.  I still have a lot of slots
that I can upgrade, and really need to upgrade in fact.

Why the BL didn't tank, I don't know.  Maybe he knew he had to leave
soon and wanted to see if I could do tank duties.  Or maybe, being the
guild leader, he just wanted to see where I was ability-wise.  Who knows.

I do know, I'll be interested to get a few levels and some equipment
upgrades, then go back and see how much better things are.
