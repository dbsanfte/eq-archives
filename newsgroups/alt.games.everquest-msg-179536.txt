If you're using one PC then you want to switch screens as little as
possible no doubt (I know I do on the odd occasion I use my Druid bot) so
grouping both is the safest option although not the most efficient.

What I would do:

Find a safe spot away from roamers.  When running two sessions on one
machine your worst enemy is other people training the "AFK" char.  Have
both chars go completely ANON and put some sort of AFK message up.

Enchanter buffs: Haste on pet, Clarity line on both if no KEI.
Druid buffs: Regrowth on pet, DS on pet, Skin line buff on all, SoW on all.

Druid pulls with Ensnare and roots/[free]DoTs mob in sight of where the
Enchanter is yet as far away as possible without getting adds.  Sit Druid
and Swap to Enchanter.  Enchanter runs up to Snared/Rooted mob and swings
once, mob whacks Enchanter back x 10 and the animation runs in to protect
master.  If root has broken while swapping screens then with a bit of luck
the Enchanter will get his (or her) own root/tash/aggro spell of your
choice off just before the mob gets to the Druid.

[Optional:  Enchanter slows mob, this obviously cuts down on amount of
healing pet will need but drops DPS from the Damage Shield.  Enchanter
takes over damage shielding pet/casting AC buffs/debuffs mobs when Druid
starts to run low.]

Sit Enchanter and swap to Druid who then heals pet or nukes until you find
the most mana efficient method.  Enchanter will probably end up with a lot
more spare mana than the Druid so drop in some nukes/DoTs/stuns from their
end to flavour once the pet has built up sufficient aggro.  If the pet is
proving a manasink and the terrain allows then try Invoke Fear.
