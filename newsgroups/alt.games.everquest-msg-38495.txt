Planning to make an SK (I just like invis and darkness spells). Now,
apart from kick, dual wield and a few skill points off every maximum
skill caps ... how does an SK look like in combat, especially
higher up. Can, to go to the extreme, a level 60 SK still be more
or less a main tank in a high level game like a war? Or is the lack
of 30 points in every skill cap or the lack of dual wield (or maybe
also less hitpoints ac? I don't know) so bad, that you become useless?
