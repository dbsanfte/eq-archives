Some people would disagree with you.

Mages don't have the same "fast kill ability" as wizards,
though I'll admit they're no slouches.

The balance lies in the fact that the magician is totally and
entirely dependent on their pet.  If the pet dies, you're a
dead mage.  If your pet is busy and something aggros you, you're
a dead mage.

Got a long multi-zone trip to make?  Get ready to cast (and
possibly re-cast and re-cast and re-cast) your pet each time
you zone.  Don't forget about summoning items and buffing your
pet.  It involves a lot of downtime.

Or, I guess, you could hope the radically unreliable invisible
stays up during the hairy parts of the travel.

Wizards have evac, root, snare, and random teleports to help
get them out of "situations".  Mages really are terribly
defenseless.

(Alright, I'm exaggerating, but you get the point.)
