ok, assuming you had a compentent enchanter, I'd expect him to pull, or
perhaps the rogue. (note that often they won't LET me pull) Otherwise
warrior is fine, but...
No way I'm in PoD at level 49 as an enchanter. You'd be amazed at the
difference 2 levels would make for the enchanter (I was). And getting
through 49 and 50 took me about 3 hours in lower guk.
But then I boggled at not having dazzle memed. I always have a mez of some
sort memorized, unless I'm somewhere it's pretty much completely useless
(say, in Kael). I have mez memmed while waiting on boats. I have mez memed
while tradeskilling. I always have it memmed. It is my key spell.

2 good reasons:
1) Slow=agro if he hasn't been building agro
2) No Snare means kiting around in spell range gets him damaged a lot (even
though he has slow), without any reciprocation from him or the other damage
dealers.
1 bad reason:
1) He didn't find a clue for sale in the bazaar for lower than the price of
his Centi swords...
Better: On pull, enchanter roots before it gets to the group, follows with
tash, everyone backs off while you malo/slow, then send in the clowns. You
would be doing much better with tash sticking as well. Plus the enchanter
can use proximity root agro to get his pet in play, if he's not charming
(and at 49, in PoD, he won't be charming).
A bit of useful teamwork for the enchanter/shaman combo. Make yourself a
'I'm casting slow' macro. If you don't want to spam the group, have it /tell
the enchanter. He can mash Tash when he sees your casting message, and it
will land before your spell does, and make it much less likely he will be
out on a limb with agro... or rather having that limb shoved rather painful
places.
Another useful tactic to suggest to the enchanter is that he can step up and
color stun (though I know people HATE the spam that comes with that... dude,
you ain't getting hit, a little spam is ok man). Color line stuns don't
generate quite the hellacious agro pally stuns do, and  can mitigate the
damage till your slow lands. At that level he should have the stuns for a
stunlock (flux, shift, skew). It's risky without slant as well, but
workable.
Alas, your Mage and Rogue are basically waiting for tallyho (attack now)
calls, though the mage should be debuffing too I guess.
Chardok would be a hoot... that group could tear chardok apart.  When I get
a group together in some zone and everyone starts asking to go elsewhere, I
ask why they are here in the first place. Of course, they are hoping to get
into a group of 55s that needs more damage, or enchanter class haste, or
similar.
