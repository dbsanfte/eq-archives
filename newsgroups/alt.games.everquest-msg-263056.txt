I don't think I would, it seems to me there is a big difference on every 
server except FV; every adventure point you get, you earn yourself (well 
ok it -is- possible to group with people who are within 7 levels of you 
and have them do the missions while you suck up the free points, afk. 
But everything has flaws, by and large its all you)

Saving up adventure points for better gear at low levels is also a fools 
game as its currently set up; you get one point per mission at first, 3 
points per mission in your 30s... its hard to do enough missions to buy 
anything really useful before you've reached your 50s, simply because 
the exp off the missions is so good that you soar up in levels quicker 
than you accumulate adventure points in quantity.

I don't mind that, really, and if thats all there was to the Bazaar 
phenomenum, then I don't think anyone would be looking for a way around 
it.  But what happens is you find high levels paying ludicrously high 
prices for trade skill items, 100 times, 1000 times what a vendor would 
pay for the same item.  And you see people selling gear in bazaar for 
triflingly small amounts of pp; again, 100th, 1000th what a vendor would 
charge.  This means that you can, before level 10, collect enough pp to 
buy something 10,000 to 1,000,000 times as valuable as you would be able 
to buy off a vendor, without any help at all.

With help, say a "friend" throwing you 1000pp, which is a trifle for 
someone level 60+ but an outlandishly large fortune at 10th level, 
you'll be able to buy gear that will last you well into your 20s... and 
that -should- be stuff you can't even get till your 50s, if the economy 
wasn't so screwed up.

If you scrimp and save your silvers in order to buy a mildly level 
inappropriate weapon instead of spreading the cash out to upgrade all 
your gear just a bit, then I applaud that.  If you save up LDoN points 
for 30 levels and never buy a thing, and splurge on something you can 
really use, thats fantastic (although I doubt you can afford anything 
fantastic if all you spent was LDoN points earned from level 20 to 50)

I'm concerned about the tradeskill angle, in fact in another post I 
mentioned that I'd be willing to kill tradeskills entirely (as an 
economic agent... leave them in so you can make things for your own use, 
to wear or for quests) in order to do this; and I think you'd have to if 
you wanted to stick to my draconian solution.

A better solution would be to go thru and assign a required level to 
every last piece of gear, but I think that's more work than I can 
reasonably expect SOE to do.

I don't, however, as I said above, feel that LDoN's represent a problem.

Something that occurs to me, though, is that you'd end up seeing MQ gear 
still turning up as a problem, except that I've also noted that I think 
the lack of anything to buy would really limit the degree to which 
people would be willing to break the intent of the rule for profit.

I'm not sure what the ramifications of this would really be.

If I could sell a WMBS for 10kpp to a vendor instead of putting it on a 
trader and hoping to get 5Kpp for it eventually, I suppose I would.

Now I've got 10kpp instead of the 5K I was hoping for.  Which means I 
can afford to pay twice as much for things I want to buy.  Which means 
that the vendors better be paying more than twice the old going rate. 
But if they are doing that then I'd have gotten 11K and can afford to 
pay that much.

I think this means that no matter what the vendors will pay, all that 
happens is that the people selling gear can charge a bit more than 
vendors pay, and people buying gear will be able to afford that just as 
easily as they could before.

Now people who aren't high enough level to actually be in the selling 
part of the game will be looking at a different equation; no more items 
that logically ought to be 4kpp but are so plentiful that they are going 
for 50pp; now those same items are going for 8kpp... or 9kpp if its 
really desirable, because the vendor is paying 8kpp.  On the other hand, 
the guys who are buying spiderling silk for 400pp a stack now can afford 
to pay 800pp for the same stack, or more, because the vendors are 
supporting them... in fact they didn't just double the price, on items 
like the 50pp special we were talking about, they multiplied it 200fold. 
  Seems to me the price of spiderling silk is going to end up going up 
in proportion too, at which point the level 10 guy is still able to buy 
what he wants.

Biggest effect of your idea would be that -current- cash suddenly drops 
to half its value, that 100kpp you've saved up is only able to buy what 
50Kpp would have bought before the patch where this went live.

But I'm no economic expert, this is just my impression of how it might 
all go.
