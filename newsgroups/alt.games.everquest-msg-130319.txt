SSoL quest was restored about a month ago, Astead Wemore (sp?) is back
in the game, he's up at the top of the ramp to the teleport pad that
gets you into the flying saucer.

Cleanse does <not> clear Root, it does occassionally occur at very
nearly (or even exactly) the same time as Root expires/breaks normally,
but that is pure coincidence.  Remember that there is a resist check to
break Root every tick (6 seconds) and every time the Rootee is hit with
a spell with a DD component, that's why Root is so horribly unreliable
against mobs higher level than you or those with high MR.
