Well,,
	Wife has been board with her 53 Wiz, and wants to start a new
project with me...
She wants to be a monk.... so that is the first half of the duo...
Any grand recommendations...  most likely these two will not reach
Uber levels   50 plus that is...

I had thought monk and necro.. (course a Erud).  and the starting zone
of Paineel and Warrens looks to be a hoot....

any recommendations on a good Monk / ???? combo and if you have the
time... the whys of the combo....

Thanks
