I learned my intense dislike of Nebraska at the age of 5.  My mother was
driving back from New Jersey to San Jose (California that is) in a VW bus
with us 5 kids.  (I should mention at this point that at the age of 5, I was
the oldest, youngest was 2, yes, my mother is a saint, either that, or
completely off her rocker).  When, in the vicinity of North Platte, NE, the
VW died.  This was back in the mid 60s, and VW parts availability in central
Nebraska was limited to say the least.  We were stuck staying in a motel
there for about 2 weeks in the middle of the summer.  The passtimes I recall
at the time were a choice between watching the grass wilt, or getting swept
away by the North Platte river, which flows at a positively amazing rate in
that vicinity.

Since that time, I have driven through Nebraska on occasion, and all I can
say is it is a very long state, with not much to see.  At least that was my
impression.
