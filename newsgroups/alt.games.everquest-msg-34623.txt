I am positive I have been in groups where there was a fight that I didn't do
anything (I was medding through, AFK, or my group took it down so fast that I
didn't have time to do anything, etc.).  I get experience, but no faction
hits.  It has happened in Velious giants groups, for sure.

On the other hand, in some zones (the Dreadlands comes to mind) hate can get
propagated throughout the zone (somehow, may have been a bug) and I end up
seeing random faction messages the entire time I'm there (from other groups
killing stuff), yet nothing ever comes charging at me.
