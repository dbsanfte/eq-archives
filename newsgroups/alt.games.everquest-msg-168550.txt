I can't say for sure.  He's a fairly "go for it" guy, and may have decided that
since the monks died getting AOW partway to the pull spot he'd honor their
effort and drag him in the rest of the way.

If thats the case, well I'd have said no, rez the monks and try again, we don't
want to be down our best MA too...  but I've often been accused of being to
cautious.

He still had plenty of things to hit, like me.

I asked about this and was told that the area we pulled to was KOS to all.
Somewhere in the Temple area?  AOW camping bodies and preventing a second try
would be reason enough to pick a different pull spot, though, if this is really
impossible.  Or perhaps our pull spot was a "safe spot" to which those thowaway
characters could be COTH'd if they can't walk there.

What areas of Kael are bindable?  Is there a spot they can be bound that we can
pull to, so they can suicide several times in a row?

A second shot would have been quite welcome, and perhaps its our only being
prepared to do one try that gives the other guilds the most reason to gripe.
With clicky sticks and so forth, we are more than capable of fully rezing and
buffing and getting back to full mana in under half an hour.

Can AOW be kept alive indefinately just by having someone aggro him
periodically?

Well we knew he was unslowable. And we knew he had more HP.  Might even have
known about AC, indirectly, several people said a large chunk of the damage
would come from DS, which we carefully maxed out (65 bard grouped with the 5
main tanks, DS potions, mage DS).  Flurry, we had no clue.

Mob Aggro.  Particularly if its the key. I have NO idea what you are talking
about.

Hmm, the friend from the higher tier guild I was talking to specifically said
rampage.  What might he have meant?  SOMETHING killed a lot of people.

MA had his back to a corner and everyone else was opposite him.  I suspect a lot
of the dead dropped in between MA's, cause without a Cheal already on the way or
defensive already active, noone is living more than a few seconds with aggro.

Thats how it seems to me.  The difference between 50% and dead really isn't all
that much, particularly when most of the clerics still had at least 50% mana at
the wipe point.  I'll wager that if things had gone a bit cleaner, I'd have
still had 50% mana when AOW died, in fact, since our DPS fell steadily during
the fight due to people dropping dead.

The pop would have been equally wasted (as far as lining their pockets was
concerned) if we'd succeded.

In fact, I'd think they'd be madder if we managed the kill, since that would
mean we'd be all the more eager about racing them to the spawn!

Apparantly there's quite a rant about it on the Morel Thule board.  Happily, my
only indulgence is the AGE newsgroup, so I can't say for sure.
