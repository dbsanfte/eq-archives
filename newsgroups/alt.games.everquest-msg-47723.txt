Er... I'm talking about averages. Of course, fighting is more exciting than 
meditating, fighting new monsters is more exciting than fighting old 
monsters, and raiding can be more exciting than xp grinding (I imagine, 
I've never been in a raid), but my point is that, if an evening spent 
playing EQ isn't more fun than what you were likely to have done with that 
evening anyway in real life, then you wasted the evening.

If you want to extend my analogy to, say, the course of a week of playing 
or a month of playing, rather than a single evening, fair enough, but my 
point remains.
