Sure it is.  If you want grease from PoI and you can't forage yourself, I 
challenge you to get it without interacting with someone else in any way.

Naw, they still couldn't get Shroud of Stealth and Escape, or Make Poison, 
or backstab, true.  But they would have put quite a dent in a Rogue's 
unique abilities.

Yeah, yeah.  But it had to be said. :)

>I was saying that high level characters can choose an AA skill of Forage.

And we're saying 'gosh, what a foolish notion'.  High level characters can 
start Ranger Alts already, if interacting with people is really that much 
of a bother.  (Admittedly, mine is level 43 now. :) )

Naw, it's only magical if you're a Necro or SK.  Monks are just really 
good at holding their breath and not flinching. :)

>Are you making that much money foraging grease in PoI?

Nope, I save it.  Or rather, make all my wood elven friends save it for 
me. :) Of course, I -did- make good money on Innovative Bow Cams for a 
while there.  You may not have tinkering as an AA either.  Start a gnome. 
:)

But if we're giving away other classes' skills as AAs, Snare please!
