Ok -

1.  Mem the spells you want for the list.
    This doesn't have to be complete - any empty gem will
    simply not change the current spell when the list is memmed.

2.  Right click on the spellbook icon on your spellgem bar.

3.  Choose "Save Spellset" 

4.  Type the name of the set (EG Buffs)

5.  Anytime you want to mem your buff spellset you can do 1 of 2 things
    	1.  Right click on the spell book icon again and select the set from 
    	    the menu.
    	2.  use the /memspellset command:  EG  /memspellset Buffs (this can
    	    be hotkeyed)

Points to remember:
1.  Memming a set will automatically unmem the spells being changed.
2.  If a spell is not changing (either that gem is blank in the new
    set, or it's the same spell as that gem in the new set) it does not
    get unmemmed.  Perfect for spells with long recasts (DA, Harvest)

HTH - any other questions, just ask.
