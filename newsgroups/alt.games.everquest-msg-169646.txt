You're the one who's claiming insight into exactly what he said, and what 
he meant when he said it, beyond the obvious... I'd settle for a good 
citation.  Like this one.

http://www.ensignmessage.com/archives/needle.html

Or this one.  (Pardon its hideousness...)

http://www.angelfire.com/wy/Franklin4YAHWEH/camelthroughneedle.html

Or this may suggest where this idea originated...

http://www.bartleby.com/81/6060.html

The real point is that it seems a bit laughably pompous to me, in any 
case, to claim to have some grasp on what was actually said that the rest 
of us somehow don't, given the number of interpretive steps and millenia 
between us and the actual occurrence.  It's like claiming you can win at 
the telephone game.

It all seems a bit beside the point, though.  It seems clear to me that he 
meant 'it is difficult for a rich man to get into heaven'.  Whether that's 
difficult in the 'putting a real live camel through the eye of a sewing 
needle' way, or the 'overcoming pride' way you're discussing doesn't 
really seem to suggest in either case that he thought material 
accumulation of wealth was anything other than a detriment.

It's a standard construction.  He says it is easier to (thing A) than 
(thing B).  It's a safe bet that thing A is pretty hard, and that the 
intent is to say that thing B is even harder still.

As to whether he was a liberal or a consrative, I think that would be tied 
more to the fact that he introduced a flood of changes in the way people 
think about life.  Liberal, pro change, conservative, status quo.  Nuff 
said.  I'm not saying he wouldn't vote Republican, but he seems pretty 
incredibly obviously liberal to mee.
