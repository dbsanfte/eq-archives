I totally agree with you here, which is why I hold the opinion that it would
be fruitless for me to attempt to hold a logical argument on the subject.
There is no laws of physics to EQ. There is no scientific data. I have my
own (maybe false) assumptions, and if I apply rigorous logic to them I will
yeild a different conclusion. He is asking me to take his assumptions (which
I may not agree with), apply logic to it and then saying I must be illogical
to hold a different opinion based on the fact I will inevititbly draw the
same conclusion as him, since it is using his assumptions.

I found no fault in his logic. I think his conclusion is just as valid as
mine, the discrepency between the two arising from the fact that both
opinions are based on differing assumptions. I (maybe falsely) realise I
have no way to determine which assumptions are correct at this time, so that
is why I will not be drawn into saying my thoughts are anything more than an
opinion.

It is also my opinion that we already have enough aspiring lawyers in the
NG - last thing we need is a batch of aspiring philosophers ; )
