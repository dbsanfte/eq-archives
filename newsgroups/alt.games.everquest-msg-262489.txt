There's lying, and then there's lying.

George W. Bush rushing us off to war on intelligence he knew was
questionable, and presenting it as iron clad proof of WMDs in Iraq,
is a completely unacceptable lie.  It so far has resulted in a huge
disasterous mess and outrageous loss of life.  (And people get mad at
Clinton for lying about a blow job.  Talk about priorities being
completely out of whack!)

Fibbing a bit on what you'll try to accomplish if you're elected
president is almost a necessity in today's political climate.  I agree
with you on that.

Saying you're "making progress" and "winning the war" in Iraq when
everyone who is capable of tuning their TV into a news channel can see
it's an outright fabrication, is another example of a completely
unacceptable lie.  I'd have 10x more respect for George W. Bush if he
was honest with us about the disaster he's created.

It's too bad people *want* to be lied to about that kind of thing, and
bury their heads in the sand and believe the nonsense from the
president without looking at things with a critical eye.  These days,
those same people have even managed to redefine "patriot" as someone
who never questions the president...when a real American, a real
patriot, *always* questions the government.

And while our backwards president invaded Iraq, who wasn't an imminent
threat, and didn't have WMDs, and the president damn well knew it --
and while this was happening, North Korea got nuclear weapons, with
Iran close on their heels.  And besides those two, there are other
nations we should have "liberated" long before Iraq.  There was just
plain no good reason or excuse to invade Iraq.

Our current president has allowed the world to become a much more
dangerous place with his misguided wars and lies to the American
people.  And they're going to elect him again!  This is a sad time in
American history.  I'm actually *ashamed* to be an American.  Maybe
the average American will figure it out when Bush has pissed off
enough Arabs and created 10x the terrorism problem we have now.

Perhaps sometime you'd like to share why you think Clinton was so
horrible, especially in light of the downright shocking incompetence
that's been demonstrated by the Bush administration.  My #1 worst
president would *easily* be George W. Bush, with Ronald Reagan a
distant #2.  (Partly because I think Ronald Reagan actually *believed*
in supply-side economics, while George W. Bush should know better!)

I've got republican friends who, when we discuss George W. Bush, will
shake their heads sadly, and say, "Why, oh why, didn't McCain win the
republican nomination instead?"

You don't agree with Kerry on ONE single issue?  That's astounding.
And that's why I'm inclined to believe you're a republican
astroturfer.  It's just very hard to believe there's not a single
issue you can think of in which you agree with the Kerry position.

At least I'm glad to see you have some reasonable and valid opinions
on what the Bush administration has done wrong.  Bush is the best
president at creating big messes I've ever witnessed.

Kerry isn't the most exciting presidential candidate, but I trust he
has the intellect necessary to fix the messes George W. Bush has
created, and I think we need him for that.  It's too bad the American
public isn't going to elect Kerry to give him that chance.

How the American public can re-elect a known failure like George W.
Bush is beyond me...  I'm not sure whether to blame it on the sad
state of education in America these days, or just a very effective
republican propaganda machine, or what...

Bush Jr.'s voodoo economics is just raw incompetence, I think.  He's
probably being played the puppet by the wealthy that surround him.
That's my best guess.  That's my only guess.  But, I guess there will
always be people who believe in things like Communism and
"Reaganomics"...

I'm missing your point here.

For the record, and I'll admit this isn't even remotely scientific, I
live in a state that voted Gore in 2000, and seems to be leaning
slightly towards Kerry this election, although we're considered a
battleground state.

I've seen -- and I swear to whatever diety you believe in, this is no
exaggeration -- at least an order of magnitude more Bush/Cheney signs
and bumper stickers than I have Kerry/Edwards signs and bumper
stickers.

You're confusing confidence with arrogance.  Once I learned the
confidence game, I was pretty damned successful.  I have proof: I
married a woman who is not only a babe, but a smart babe who isn't
insane.  I know, it's hard to believe there are women out there who
are hot, smart, AND sane!  :)

If I'm wrong, please accept my apologies.  Ever since republicans
discovered the magic of astroturfing, the've been effectively
propagandizing on Usenet, and you seemed to fit the mold.  Republicans
have completely dominated democrats in terms of propaganda, despite
claims to the contrary.  It's really very impressive.

The fact is, NOBODY got a tax cut.  What they DID get, was being
FORCED to loan money from foreign governments.  The change to the tax
brackets after the fact means you're responsible for a greater burden
of the debt produced by that so-called "tax cut".  YOU get to pay back
even more of the tax cut given to millionaires and billionaires.

Here's an example (exaggerated to make a point):

Bill Gates gets back $100,000,000 in a "tax cut".

You get back $300 in a "tax cut".

Now then, Americans eventually have to pay back the loans the U.S.
government took out from foreign governments to pay that money back.

The tax brackets are changed, mostly to benefit the wealthiest of the
wealthy.

Bill Gates now effectively owes $999,999,500.

You owe $800.  Because you owe what YOU were forced to loan, and
thanks to the changes to taxes, you get the extra burden of paying
back part of the wealthy "tax cut" too.

Optional: Bill Gates invests that extra money in a Research &
Development center in India, so that he can employ less expensive
Americans.

Who are the winners here?  It sure as hell ain't you.

Regarding deficits and the national debt, let me ask you this: Do you
think it's ethical to take out credit cards in your children's name,
charge them up to obscene numbers, and then make them responsible for
paying it off?

That's what the national debt is.

George W. Bush is pushing YET ANOTHER tax cut now.  Of course, suckers
will buy it hook, line, and sinker.  "Ooooh, more money for me!"
Without even comprehending it's not free money, it's a LOAN they'll
have to pay off someday.  (Or their kids, or their kids' kids, you get
the picture.)

It never ceases to amaze me how easily people can be suckered by chump
change.

I have no disdain for controlled capitalism.  Raw capitalism leads to
corporate dominance, which is even WORSE than being dominate by "big
government".

George W. Bush is all about making capitalism as uncontrolled as
possible in the U.S.  That's downright dangerous, for all of us.

I'm in favor of making sure the distribution of wealth doesn't get too
out of whack.  No, I'm not a communist.  I'm just a believer in not
letting people's greed get too out of control.  Controlled capitalism
is the answer.
