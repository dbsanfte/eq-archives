Aye - I still think he would proberly be one of the best designers for
making a gaming system and world for "enthusiasts" - but personally I think
he is a little to inflexible for making those same worlds fully enjoyable
for general consumption by the rest of us.

The level >10 changes were pretty much inconsequential - that is such a
small part of the game for the experienced EQ'er, yet so crucial for
ensuring new blood comes in and <stays> to make their way in Norrath. I know
some people think that true newbies are too few and far between to take into
consideration, but I tend to view them as an cornerstone. They are what
guarantees we will still have a world to play in years to come ; )

Brad may be very talented, but as so many very talented people are he has
his glaring faults to temper it. I don't know about anyone else, but I know
exactly what I want and take a dim view of people who assume I am too stupid
to realise what is fun and what isn't. By all means reward those who come to
Norrath to work 10 hours a day, but it is unwise to neglect those who just
come to relax and play.
