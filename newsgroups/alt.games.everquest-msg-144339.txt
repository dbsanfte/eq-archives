Quite possible.  But what was once fixed may again someday be broken... 
and the stupid necklace consumes a valuable inventory slot. :) Not to 
mention I already have to change necklaces far too often, and it seems ike 
less effort just to make everybody like me. :) Shoot, I almost have Grobb 
faction up to where I don't need an Illusion, what a timesaver that will 
be. :) Just about 3,000 fire beetleeyes left to go. :)
