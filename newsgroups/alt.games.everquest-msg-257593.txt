How often does that come into play in a 30s lvl pickup group? We're
talking about someone with good gear judging from his other post so
he's very likely over the AC soft cap against the mobs. Any healer
he's grouped with probabably won't have CH so the extra hitpoints are
wasted in all but one circumstance. 

The only thing it's useful for is you have a big pull where your tank
needs that extra hitpoint buffer to survive the early turns until you
get things under control. If your healers can't keep you alive in that
case, odds are that your group has bigger problems than just a lack of
Temp. Heal agro is usually your major concern in that situation and
temp won't help you with that. 

Can it ever save you? Sure but why not get your healers used to
working with tanks that have reasonable hitpoints instead? It's gonna
happen eventually anyway, might as well get used to it in your 30s.
Heaven forbid that your Temp ever gets dispelled! Gonna run back to
PoK and get a refresh? 

Does all this make someone "crippled" or "stupid" if he doesn't get
Temp or KEI or whatever? Wanna guess who'd I'd consider the spoiled
idiot if that question gets asked? :p

So enlighten me.
