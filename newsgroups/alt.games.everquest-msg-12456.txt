I would go and test in either location, but I don't have any disease dot
capable chars, and definatly none the level to go on raids.

I did try stinging swarm on them yesterday and that makes them killable
by balancing their regen with damage. (Note no suggestion that it
negates regen)

However by 14th they are almost all green so there is little point in
going there. I guess that the top level is now doable in a group of
level 12s, but for soloing it is impossible with the mad regen. 

Ho humm,

Jim
