 Yeah. King is a pushover, for the most part. Queen is just nasty. It's
interesting seeing all the casters in the group die at the same time. Of
course I usually die 6 seconds later but ah well. It's all in good fun.

 You can do it that way. But it's not a requirement or anything. I don't
think we've ever done a DA pull but I don't see anything wrong with it.
There's really no one right way to do Royals. Just whatever works for
you.

>Mage with CotH. Because we'll have people coming and going, probably.

 Put the Mage in the pull group. If the Monk gets in trouble CoH him and
try it again. Might save a few deaths. The puller dying slows everything
down and the main key to a Royals raid is speed. Two experienced Monks
would be a nice option so that if one dies the other can just take over.

 This is really the fastest and easiest way if you have the classes to
do it. With single pulling you're going to risk repops but when you can
drop 15 at once you don't really have to worry about that.

 Well here's something easier depending on your force and how fast
you're killing things. Stay in the Library and pull King room mobs to
there. Once you get him alone, or with a couple, just have everyone fall
down the pit and engage King. If you're fast enough you'll have him dead
before Library repops so you don't have to worry about GFlux. Or you
could pull him out of the pit just to be safe. I mainly say that because
I hate (hate!) pulling to the hallway. Normally people let the herbalist
room repop while camping there. That's a wipeout just waiting to happen.

 Or you could just stay in the room and wait for him.

 We've used that a few times. You only really need a Mage to be non-kos.
It makes things a lot easier if you can just start near the library and
skip clearing all that other stuff. Also, the Chardok quests aren't that
bad, so I dont think you'd have a big problem convincing a few people to
work up their faction. Put a Shaman on the list as one of the first to
pull once fighting begins. A slowed mob is a wimpy mob. Just be careful
that you don't have half your guild working on Chardok faction. Makes a
Royals raid a little tough when people don't log on because they don't
want to mess up their faction.
