Caster wizards are a pain for a few reasons.
1. If you root them they can still attack you.
2. Effectively bottomless mana pool so they can nuke you much more than
   a PC wizard can.
3. Lots of hit points (relative to PC wizards) and so they're not much
   easier to kill than "melee" MOBs.

So you can see that some of the reasons to avoid NPC wizards do not
apply to PC wizards.

Of course, caster clerics are even worse; they can nuke you *and* they
can heal themselves. Not to mention healing the other MOBs. The number
of times I've seen a caster cleric's HP jump back to full from 10% HP
is depressing...
