I'm not too sure about that, actually.   I believe it's broken.
Tinkered fishing poles give a 5% bonus to fishing, and you
can see it when you inspect the item.   The various other
items with stat bonuses (mechanized lockpicks (2% to
pick locks) and the new Luclin tradeskill items (the geerlock
items) all show their bonus as well.

I can't think of a reason why they'd show the bonus on all the
other items but not on bait so I'd assume it's broken or not
yet implemented.   (Tinkered "animated bait" doesn't show a
bonus either.)

And just to vent personally, collecting chitterling barbs for the
geerlock sewing contraption (5% to tailoring) is a PITA.  It's the
most difficult one to collect.   The farmed item for the jewelcraft
bonus is trival, though. ;)
