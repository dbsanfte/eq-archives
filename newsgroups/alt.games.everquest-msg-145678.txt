Not to mention, shaman slows are generally better.

That's a tough one.  A good slow will serisously reduce the damage output of
a mob.  It's situational, and level dependant.  At lower levels, the amount
of slowdown is not that significant, at high levels when you are slowing a
mob by 70% or more, slow is extremely important.  At level 39 you can slow a
mob 50% which is pretty significant in damage reduction.  If you can slow
50%, and haste your melee 40%, you are probably better off from a damage
taken vs damage dealt over not slowing, and hasting 50%.  You save 70 mana
on each cast of Alacrity vs Celerity, and only spend 100 mana on the slow.
You might consider, Celerity for the MA, and Alacrity for the rest.  That
should save you enough mana to cast Tepid Deeds on the mob, while still
allowing the MA to keep aggro.

Heh.  Seriously though, if they don't know what you are mezzing, it's tough
to know what not to attack.  This is a pickup group that you are talking
about, so you cannot expect good group cohesion.  Communication is quite
important in that case.  Let them know what you are mezzing, and to stop
attacking it.  It's good if they also let you and others in group know what
they are doing.
