Her, not him ;)
Unbuffed, she has taken down three blues and I think 4 blues in one
fight (they didn't all attack at once; adds are good fun), but then
again, she's very young and reasonably well dressed.
Yesterday, without any 'external' buffing, my 22 SK and her 22 necro
partner took out 6 gnolls, gnoll shamans and high gnoll shamans in
Lake Rathe that all came in one pull, without mez (he gets it in two
levels), root (neither of us gets that), or fearing.
