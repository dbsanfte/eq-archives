Yes, that's pretty much true.  The only thing I'd add to that is that
dungeons are, in general, better experience and better loot than a
comparable (by level) outdoors zone.

I don't believe that's true.

Mobs give XP based upon their level. That can be modified by
the ZEM (Zone Experience Modifier) but that's it.  Effectively
that means mobs within the same zone give XP based purely
on level.

What does make a difference when grinding XP is the HP total
of the mobs.  When looking for XP, it's better to hunt mobs of
the same level which have lower hit points.   A group (or soloist)
can kill them faster resulting in more XP/hour.  And due to the
way XP is generated (square of the mob's level) it's better to
kill low-level blues faster than high-level blues slower.

So, in Runnyeye, it's better to hunt the lower-level mushrooms
than the higher-level goblins strictly due to the kill rate a group
can generate.  The possible drops aren't material in terms of XP.

It is a general rule, though, that mobs with good drops are
higher-level, have higher-HPs than other mobs of that level, or
both.   It's the higher-level and higher-HPs that makes hunting
them bad for XP, though, not the loot they drop.  (Well, that and
a -- in general -- longer spawn time.)
