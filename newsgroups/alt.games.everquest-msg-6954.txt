Well, you see, the mobs don't keep their loot in their shoes.

But this raises disturbing questions about why, prior to today's
patch, you could only loot fallen Giants from right around
the seat of their pants...

I wouldn't go that far.  When doing Archery, your range is the range
of your bow, PLUS the range of whatever arrow(s) you have equipped.

So a bow with range 0 using arrows of range 150 (even cheap fletched
arrows have range 150) would still give you a reasonable (if not
great) range of 150, which is farther than a cheap storebought
bow using cheap storebought arrows.
