Just simple reading of history and forming my own conclusions.  I cite my
own brain.  I know it's odd for people to have thoughts of their own...

The US started ramping up military spending, Japan noticed and tried to head
us off at the pass.  It was an incredibly stupid move, in hindsight.  At the
time it probably seemed like a viable idea to the Japanese to deal with a
historically isolationist country that had already sat out of *years* of
this "justified" war by scaring the thought of war out of us.  Ironic how
that actually turned out eh?

If you're being invaded and face the possibility of ceasing to exist as a
nation, do you care if you start WW3?

Hopefully we'll never find out.
