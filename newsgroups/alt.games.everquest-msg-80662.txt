There are no ports to an island with cyclops. The only island of this
description is in Ocean of Tears, through which you pass on way back to
Butcher Block from Freeport. So in travelling by boat from Freeport your son
got off at the first stop by mistake (sister Isle) and wandered over to the
next two isles which is the Seafuries isle (i.e big cyclops)

Sounds to me the high lvl porter is a "crock of" story for some strange
reason that only your son knows
