Greetings all,

I just  installed a new  soundcard to replace my  Soundblaster Adaptec
Live Value edition.

I  replaced it with  an Soundblaster  Audigy Platinum.  Now everything
seems  to work fine  in all  games that  I have  tried it  with except
Everquest.

I can hear the music in the game just fine. But no soundeffects or any
other sounds  other than the music  can be heard.  Also,  ever since I
put the card in, I can not exit Everquest  without my computer locking
up hard on the character select screen.

Specs:

	1.2 Ghz Athlon with A7PRO MB
	Full SCSI, No ide at all.
	Audigy Platinum.
	Asus V8200 Geforce 3.
	639MB Ram.
	
	Windows 2000 server.

All have the latest drivers, including the VIA drivers.

And there  where no problems  at all with  EQ before the  upgrade. And
again, this only  happens with EQ, no other game on  the machine is in
the slightest affected. And they sound a heck of a lot better to!

Needless to say  it is anoying to not play  without sound effects, but
even more so  is the hard reboot to  get out of EQ when I  try to exit
from the character screen or use /q or /Q from within the game.

Anybody have any ideas.? Anything I can do to maybe stop EQ from using
EAX. (If it has anything to do with that at all that is)

Thanks!
