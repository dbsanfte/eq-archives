Well, there is a lot of advice around for tuning Windows VM. Virtual memory
is the sum of the physical RAM and the page file size on your disk. With
default settings, Windows will automatically resize the page file as VM
requirement grows. At some point it starts to warn you that VM is being used
up. I wouldn't be suprised if this is around one or two times the amount of
physical RAM you have (256 or 512MB for you system).

An old rule for Windows was to create a unfragmented fixed size page file.
Many of the VM rules of thumb, though, have been argued since the
introduction of massive amounts of real memory on PC's. Since you will be
adding memory soon anyway, I would create a fixed 540MB fixed page file on
your fastest drive. To do this, you need to remove the page file on the
target drive using the System->Performance->Virtual Memory window. If you
have more than one drive, create a temporary page file on another drive or
Windows will complain at you. Once VM has been disabled on the target drive,
defrag that drive. Then go back to the Virtual memory settings and set the
Min and Max pagefile size to 540.

There are also third party defrag utilities that will defrag pagefiles for
you. I also like Cacheman5 which is downloadable. Great utility for all
flavors of Windows and the help section alone is worth the price - great
education in Windows memory management.
