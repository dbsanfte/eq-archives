We almost had a great battle in the tunnel from EC to N Ro at about 5am CDT
this morning.
Over a hundred Evils joined up at the zone line with a promise of a great
battle with the Newts who where forming on the N Ro side of the zone.  By
the time we got organized and zoned through (I am Evil) the Newts if they
were there had fled.
Not a trace of them.  Come on, let's have a battle.  It's not like you are
really gonna die, It's a game right?  Let's have some action!  Where are the
large scale battles on Sullen Zek?  I would like to get into the PvP action.
Tell us where you are fighting on Sullen Zek.  See you on the field :)  Is
there a web site with news of the PvP goings on and battles for Sullen yet?
