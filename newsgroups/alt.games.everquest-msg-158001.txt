Uh - those ARE realdolls on that site :) It's a site some guy set up
to show off his realdoll *collection*.  He has ... I don't know how
many, but there's a picture of some shades-of-auchwitz bed showing
about a half dozen.  He has little roleplaying sessions with them,
too.  He has a section on how to repair them when they get 'torn'
(meep).  I'm just saying the official realdoll site is nothing
compared to some of the 'fansites' out there.

I'd point you to goatsex, but that's going from nasty to downright
evil.
