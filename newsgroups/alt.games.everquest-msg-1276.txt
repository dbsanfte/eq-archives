Sure.  How much pp did it cost?

Nice attitude.

Correct.  Not relevant but 100% correct.

Casting symbols is a direct pp expense that benefits a group as a
whole, and which a group as a whole should share.  Exactly like a
wizard stone for tp to planes.

I don't particularly like to make an individual pay for a symbol.  If
the enchanter or tank needs it, the group should share the expense.
But even though it's not really fair, it is a hell of a lot fairer than
making the cleric pay the whole thing.

I wouldn't dream of "gating out" over this, much less during a battle.
I might just pay for it and put the appropriate players on my "don't
group -- greedy asshole" list.  Or if I'm feeling irritable, I would
offer to cast Pinzarn for free (8gp) and groupsay "anyone who wants the
700HP symbol needs to pay me 11pp for the reagent".

BTW, as is typical, when I have done the latter usually one or two
players will give twice as much as needed.  I rarely see cheap or
disagreeable people any more.  At higher levels you have learned who
they are and have found people like yourself to play with.
