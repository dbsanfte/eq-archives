As a Halfling, I get Hide as a racial skill .. It helps, really. I use it
most often when I'm camping something where I'm KOS (such as the Froglok
Summoner in Guk) .. Instead of casting Superior Camo, I just Hide until it
sticks (frogs don't con scowling any more) and I'm perfectly fine to go afk
for the 17-ish minutes to the next spawn. It's more trustworthy than Invis,
IMHO.
