Your faith in signatures is misplaced. Unless you actually read the 
certificate and verify that its owned by who you think owns it... but 
who does that... if the activeX component has said it was digitally 
signed by EQIIBeta how many people would catch it?

And even then... here's an interesting read about a technique that 
allows(allowed?) you to install buggy (exploitable) activeX components 
digitally signed by Microsoft itself even after fixed versions were 
installed. If *can't* trust components signed by Microsoft do you really 
think Sony is any better.
