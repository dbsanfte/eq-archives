Not to mention death comes somewhat randomly in EQ... as you zone in 
between a hillgiants legs...

EQ is not a good place for PD. From mobs that deathtouch to the entire 
thing being designed about wiping your group/raid until you figure an 
encounter out.

PD isn't a bad thing per se, but in a game that can kill you arbitrarily 
and for no reason its pretty counter productive.
