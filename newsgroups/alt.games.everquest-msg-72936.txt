Hi all,

Lets talk about the Pet damage rate. In shadweaver thicket, Paludal
caverns, and Hollowshade Moor.  The zones I have been in with my
Vah Shir (aka kitty) Beastlord. I am not seeing oh how this is a good
pet class. Maybe it gets better after lvl  22.  But if the trend continutes
like this
midgame/end game going to be bad.  And due to pathing issues limited to
open areas for solo work.

Lvl 16 pet. Lets look at the damage pet is able to do.
On paper if pet is hitting for max
18(right damage) +18(left damage) +18(bash) + 30dd (pet proc buff)=  84
And I might be off on the bash.  I have never seen an 18.
On paper only. Thouse are the maxes possable.  the lowest is 4 damage.
As to pet healing CH and partials.  I will leave that for the bottom.
With that said on to the stats.

Please keep in mind this is mob to pet lvl not mob to you lvl
Stats I have been watching is figured with Fleeting Fury buff on pet.

Green to pet hits for 16's most of the time and procs alot

Light Blue not really easy to figure what is Lightblue to pet and there
is no xp in this for you.

Dark Blue to pet hits for 14- 18 's alot and procs alot.
This is most often Light Blue to you.

Pet on even cons to pet will most of the time hit 12's , proc's maybe 1
out 10 strikes.

Yellow (1) to pet. Hits most often for 8's  procs 3 out 10  strikes.
Wish damage was shown on procs

Yellow (2) to pet.  Hard to figure.  damage is lower if your seeing alot of
6's
and low proc's then its this one.

Red to pet (1).  Hits if lucky for around 4's procs I am suprized when it
happens.
More misses then anything else.

Red to pet (2+) this would be a con even to you at 21. No stats yet.
 Dont look like its going to be good.
Best I can think of so far better group at least at this lvl.

These are the normals I have been seeing.
Solo abiltity.  Dont do it. Not without a huge amout of downtime.
Yes you can heal your pet.  Dont pull more then a single mob.  You might
get lucky and be able to do a pair. Dont pull con blacks to you since they
will just own your pet even with heals.  And might not taunt off you.

Or at least get use to loading please wait. And that brings up the xp loss
to being a pure pet class. Since anything else but healing your pet is not
advised
to a non twink.
