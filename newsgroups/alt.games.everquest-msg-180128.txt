Okay something is really hosed with my vah shir models. I use the ones
made to be old world a few months ago.

For some reason only the tiger model is showing up (unarmored no
matter what is being worn), except for the head, which is always a
white tiger with a helmet.

Even stranger, this model appears to slowly degrade my framerate. I
observed this at the character select screen, watching my vah shir
character I have turn in circles for a time. This looks awfully like a
video memory leak of some kind.

Deleting the texture files in the EQ folder *did nothing*. The problem
was immediately back, if it was ever gone at all.

This problem also happened with the Luclin version as well.

Any ideas?
