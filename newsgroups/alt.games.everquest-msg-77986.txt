More bloated than it absolutely needs to be, but still better than
Microsloth's fare.  Personally, I prefer Word Perfect and Corel's suite, but
I've long since lost those programs, and SO's good enough to keep me from
feeling a need to go out and buy it anew.

Order of the Mallet

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
