Dunno about Riverdale, but Guk for instance just plain kills my GeForce3 (!)
Machine with 512 MB Ram and a 1 GHz machine. I had to go from high quality
to medium quality textures. Now it's more or less liquid again (apart from
large raids, where 50 people show up .. very very slow then again due to
all the enabled new character models). If you do not own SoL, that would
be weird.
