I believe you theoretically could, but I think you're missing the point.  
To be a 'better rogue', one should have access to these tools and be able 
to use them when they're needed... When their helpfulness exceeds their 
cost.  Being a wasteful rogue is not being a 'better rogue'.  That would 
be like a cleric rebuffing temp or symbol before every pull, just to make 
sure it wouldn't wear off unexpectedly...

The choice isn't limited to never learning poison making and applying at 
all, -or- using poisons on every single pull.  Try looking for a middle 
ground. :)
