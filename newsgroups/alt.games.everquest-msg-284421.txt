A very sound point.  I have lvl 35 to 45's in Overthere killing the
Skorpikis in the chasm, solo, and the xp is great on them because they
are dark blue and it's a hot zone.  The lvl 35 gained a couple of
levels in a reasonably short time, getting about 4 to 5 blue notches
per kill.  At 45 it's roughly 3 notches.

Two good tips if you've never tried the Skorpikis before:

1)  Overthere might be busy, but it's deserted in the Chasm. Based on
the week or so I have been hunting there I have been the only player
in there!  It's like that part of the zone just doesn't exist, or
people just shudder and pass it by, or something. 

2)  It's nice and close to PoK if you use the natural slope out at the
north-east end of the Chasm. (It looks like an upside-down hook) 

Lastly, the Skorpikis always land one attack of 241 when they first
hit you, so let your pet (if no proper pet, well, a tank *is* a sort
of pet, to the group, anyway lol) take the hit for you.  Ideally you
want the Skorpikis slowed and feared so they just run slowly away -
this works well for my Necro, who throws in the pet and a DoT or two
before flailing away with my 1HB at the retreating foe  :)
