Why is it always the designer's fault? Bob did mention the battle.net
folks. How should or even could Blizzard change the community? They cut
the grieving about Killstealing. Since you can't get the reward once
somebody else has engaged a mob that's it. As stupid as these battle.net
folks are they down't seem to care about grouping. So they race. Unless
they learn I don't see them getting to the higher risk/reward zones
where grouping is required. So fine with me. I can stand the morons in
the lower lvls. Everquest has them too. ;)
But screaming for the devs to fix something that isn't even broken is
ridiculous.
