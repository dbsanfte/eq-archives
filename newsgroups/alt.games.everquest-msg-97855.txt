No it won't.  If it takes 10,000,000 exp points to get through 45, and 
each kill is modified by a 1.9 hell level modifier, it's still taking 
10,000,000 points.  It just takes about 52.6% as many kills.  I have seen 
NOTHING from Verant claiming that it will take the same number of kills 
overall.

Only if you think that when they say experience they mean kills.  I would 
like to think that they have learned a few things in the past three years, 
but since they're being very careful with the wording, AND not giving 
specifics, I'm going to continue to question it.
