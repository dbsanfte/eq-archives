It's because you Dot'd them. FD works just as you anticipated, however,
each time you do damage to a mob you're back on the hate list unless
feigned. If you laid a bunch of dots on one of the mobs and remained
feigned while they wander a good ways away, then pop up, on the next
tick your dots will do more damage and the mob will then come running
back to have a chat with you about your general lack of manners. If he's
still near any of his buddies who were wandering away with him, he will
share his displeasure and they'll come along because they're all in the
same Union Local.

If you have to feign after the gimp goes down, you need to stay feigned
until you get all of the "Your Dot_01 has faded" messages come in. Then
you can stand up at your leisure. (Barring other close by mobs, of
course.)

Even more excellent writing, by the way. I'm getting Rastus EQ T-shirts
made this week. Can you get any screen shots for me? ;-)
