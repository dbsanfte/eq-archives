The loot rules you laid out were completely fair because *YOU STATED
THEM UP FRONT*  By remaining in the group, the other people agreed to
them.  Besides, do they think you were deliberately throwing rolls in
hopes of getting the nice item (which you might not have even had at
the time of some of the aug rolls)?

We run mainly guild groups, but we run them much the same way -

NBG roll immediately on augs, hold all droppables to the end.

If you got something you're out of the rotation until everyone
has something.

Droppables are NBG first also.

If no one wants to roll on an aug (because they don't want to
lose the chance at a better item later) then we throw it open
and don't count that loot as disqualifying folks from further
rolls.  (+6 cha?  Like I'm taking that when we got a nice
earring that's going up for greed at the end.)
