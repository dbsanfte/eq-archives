Kind of. I play a similar one, Kings of Chaos (URL and my link in .sig,
if you really are interested. No, this isn't meant as spam. :) ) and
they are kinda fun. THey are basically a kind of turn-based strategy
game, where you get a certain number of troops per day, plus a
percentage of the troops anyone you sign up gets. So yeah, in that
regards, it's a pyramid, but the only money that is ever involved is the
advertising revenu for the people running it.

They are silly games, yeah, but I like it. :)

Jamie
