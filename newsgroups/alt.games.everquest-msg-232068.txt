Delay of the weapon has nothing to do with the proc rate. The proc rate
is a hidden internal program code that is not revealed to the player.
Sony sets the rate for each proc type. The only thing that the player
can control over that contributes to the proc rate is Dexterity. This has
been shown in parses that higher dex does indeed produce more
procs.

So the only way to determine if the rate is decent on
this augment is for someone to buy it and parse it. I don't
want to spend a bunch of my points on this only to find out
its useless, like many things in the game. I already wasted
510 points on a damage proc aug the gets resisted 50% of
the time on the mobs I fight.

Yes but if it doesn't proc very often then it might be better to
put a different proc type like the lifetap proc from mistmoore.
+75 hit points healing you and -75 to the mob to kill it faster.

It doesn't stack with the Guard of Vie spells according to Lucy.
Problem is though I never see clerics cast it that much. Usually only at the
beginning of the battle. Main problem is that would be another mana
hog. I think most people think 'screw it i'll just save the mana for
healing'

With the Bulwark of Vie spell, the highest level cleric 'Guard' spell, is
300 mana. It absorbs 10% damage up to 1600. Now a Complete Heal
does 7500 for 400 mana. The efficiency is just not there to make it
worth it most of the time. This would only make it useful for close
raid type battles where you have to eek out every last little bit of damage
mitigation/absorbtion and healing you can. The other bad thing is that
how does the cleric know when this spell wears off? The cleric that is
on 'guard' duty would just have to constantly re-cast it guessing at the
time the damage of the guard is used up. The tank sure isn't going to
say 'guard gone' evry time it goes, he has enough to worry about.

It would not be efficient to use the Guard type spells for ordinary
adventures or grinds. But with the weapon guard proc it would at
least be automatic.

The 5% would be huge over the long run. But only if the weapon procs
enough to keep that buff icon up most of the time. If it only procs once
every 3 minutes and the icon is gone in 30 seconds then its useless.
