*interested*

how does the "unregulated freemarket" system work when there is an
expensive infrastructure to build thats already in place and if you
were to invest huge sums in building it the competition , who have
already paid off more of theirs than you will have could just drop
their prices till you went boom?

how do you handle putting in new phone/electricity/whatever lines
to every home?

How do you handle the decrease in efficiency of these distribution
infrastructures when you have lots of competing ones instead of
single ones?

Uninformed, but curious,
