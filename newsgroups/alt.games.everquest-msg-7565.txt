    If you just want the spell, go to PoG and offer to Harmony for a group.
You don't get faction hits for Harmony (as you never hit the hate list),
you're contributing, and the spell drops are apparently frequent enough that
getting the spell would be appropriate. Just don't cast on the killers -
some mobs (Protectors of the Grove) have zone-wide aggro range, and if one
is up when you cast you could end up taking a faction hit.
