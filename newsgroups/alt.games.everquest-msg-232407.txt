You probably are missing some things if you think that FT1 is the best there
is.  There is FT2 that fits on ldon armor and there is also FT2 that fits on
old world armor, though that one is expensive and must be bought with points
from guk which many consider too hard or something.  The armor is also very
nice.  Probably on the same level as ornate, maybe better.  There are a
couple weapons bought from mir camp that are really nice by themselves and
would be awesome with a +2 damage augment.  For the bards that are pre or
post epic there are augments to give instrument mods (including singing, but
no percussion).
