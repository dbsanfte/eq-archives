A Native American elder once described his own inner struggles in this
manner:

"Inside of me there are two dogs. One of the dogs is mean and evil. The
other dog is good. The mean dog fights the good dog all the time."

When asked which dog wins, he reflected for a moment and replied, "The one
I feed the most."
