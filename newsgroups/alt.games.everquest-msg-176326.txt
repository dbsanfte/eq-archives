Chanters are uber soloers when using charm.

at 50 you just have allure, which is fine to solo with in some places.

at 54 you get beckon, and you can start raking in the exp in Planes of
Power.

at 64, you get the soon to be nerfed Command of Druzzil, which is currently
the most powerfull soloing spell in the game (besides maybe snare).
