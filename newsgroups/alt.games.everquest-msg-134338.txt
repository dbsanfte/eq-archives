I didn't wait for an answer here actually, started DLing the
patches when the question occured to me.

I have 2 hours to go, it says here

One set of kids already gone, but another incoming and
of course my own still here.  Would have been a 14 hour
EQ day, when I doubt I've played more than an hour
a day in the past three weeks.

Ah well, the patch itself looks darn sweet, and I'll not
be playing much over the next week, which is where they
will be trying to fix all the stuff that goes wrong
