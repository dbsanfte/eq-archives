I know why i dislike droga . The goblins there have a far higher magic
resistance than is normal for mobs that level . Most of the mobs there are
casters , they are DANGEROUS casters along with the normal; hit as hard as a
warrior syndrome all mobs have .

Other than that the mob density and zone layout is very nice .

The experience increase will do very little to address the inherent risk of
this dungeon . Pet users are highly advised to not attempt this dungeon at
any level solo. Non pet caster soloists are warned that they probably will
not be able to handle a bad pull or an added wanderer (of which there are
many ). Tanks are advised that they will have to run from way the hell away
after they die. That leaves full groups at the experience gaining levels. It
is not a pickup dungeon since mobs can be right at the edge of either side
of the zone and it is so far off the beaten track . You also have to deal
with the basic desire for no grouping or small grouping espoused by many at
these levels . If you do get a group they will be new at real grouping and
thus incompetent . I expect the new experience bonouses will provide only
for advanced powerleveling 201 and no real added benefit. It is a step in
the right direction though . More benefit than the proposed would be
rendered by lowering the mr of all mobs in this dungeon by 25% or so and
halving the hps of all caster mobs there.
