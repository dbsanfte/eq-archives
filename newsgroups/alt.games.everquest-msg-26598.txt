I beg to differ with you on the clerical invunerability buff stripping off
of you when you zone into the Hole.  I took a level 2 cleric with Divine
Aura, and skydived down the hole with it active.  Survived the landing, and
got to take screen shots of two beasties trying to eat me before the buff
wore off.

Unless they nerfed Divine Aura recently, it should still work.

I don't know of any other spell remotely like it that won't strip off of you
when you zone into the Hole.
