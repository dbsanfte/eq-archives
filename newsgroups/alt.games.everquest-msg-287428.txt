hey all,

i guess i should start with "oops" since i didn't actually ask here...

but i would really love to run a private eq server ... something
accessible over the web, but run off a regular PC that would host
maybe 5-10 people only

original graphics, original eq + kunark + velious

i'm thinking like instead of d&d, rolling dice and using pencils and
having to talk talk talk talk talk to make a real world, just using
original eq to evoke what words used to do and letting players fill in
the rest with imagination

especially the 5-10 players i have in mind ... i think it would be
great


now, i know there's no way to do this with stock eq; unlike
counterstrike, for example, i can't start a LAN version of the game

is there any software out there that could though?

i searched a while ago and found things like projectEQ, but i never
finished up the research because i let eq2 distract me

do any of you have experience with this?

i suppose i should ask - does this violate the EULA? i could imagine
there being some clause about how using the eq software in this way
would violate my agreement with sony, but that's OK because (a) i paid
for it, i can do what i want with it, and (b) i don't need sony for
anything...as i said, i paid for it, i'm going to modify it to do what
i like -- the only reason i bring it up is because i wouldn't want the
1 person i have in mind who still pays sony to play their games to end
up in trouble (not that they could ever find out, but still)

(or, obviously, instead of "do" i might mean "find that someone's done
exactly this for me")


i'd like to write my own quests - not sure if that would mess up how
this might play out



anyway,

thanks for the input
