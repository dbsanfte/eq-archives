	I'd expect it on a test server.  I do no expect it, at least
not with such purported frequency, on production servers.

	That's another strawman.  My complaint is that Sony is obviously
attempting to reduce the cost of maintaining the service by failing
to perform quality control to the degree necessary to avoid negative
impact on the customer experience.  I'm particularly irked since the 
kinds of cost cutting I see are well known not to cut costs, and so my 
discomfort as well as the discomfort of the poor Sony engineers trying 
to keep things running is for naught but a gold star on some executives 
yearly evaluation.  

	Pisses me off.
