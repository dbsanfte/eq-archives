You don't really need any particular resist gear for Fear.  Most of
general mobs there are melee.  There are some evil eye things that
cast this REALLY annoying AE Nullify Magic.  A couple of Shadowknights
also.  I dunno about Cazic himself, he's the only mob my guild hasn't
taken on yet.

Basically for Fear, just some decent AC gear if you're melee and
you're good to go.
