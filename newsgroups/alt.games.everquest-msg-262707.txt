hey all, just asking for the hell of it...

anyone have any tips for the wiz epic 1.5 fight ( elite sun revenant )  in
scarlet desert?

i lost all my 8k* hp to his dots in a little over  a  minute and a half?
maybe 2?

he's really mean, and very ugly, and honestly not very big (c'mon, at least
LOOK eebil!)...

but yeah, wiped 50+ of us, most ele+

sure, it's a ranged fight, we know that much....

and from what i saw (was only there for 1 attempt) it seems the AE is the
biggest thing (range is insane); melee was only ~2k or so?



so

that's what i've got, anyone able to add?

thanks,

~fennin.vaxo~
