Yeah, I'll try again tomorrow on Fileplanet.  Of course, this time
I'll actually know where to check.

I think the guys posts the message on his site's forums, first, and
then on the webpage.  By the time the site is updated, I think the
majority of the spots are gone.

If not, I'd imagine the open beta is less than a week away.  If the
game really is out in 2 weeks, they'll want a big test before it goes
live.
