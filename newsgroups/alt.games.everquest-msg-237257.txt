A red on a blue server is never good.  None of the blues can heal you, port 
you or rez you.  And the reds, if you can find another one, which I highly 
doubt, will be able to kill you.  You can try petitioning to get your blue 
status back, not sure how hard it will be, sometimes the GMs are evil and 
give you an impossible task.  Or you can totally say byebye to that 
character and re-roll.  Or you can suck it up and solo for the entire rest 
of your career, don't even try to group, I certainly wouldn't want you in 
my group, you are a liability because I can't heal you or port you out if 
things go south.
