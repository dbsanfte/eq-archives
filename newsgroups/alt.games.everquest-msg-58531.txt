Gorenaire is on RingOfScale faction, lowered only by killing dragons/wurms
in Kunark, and Esorpa of the Ring in Western Wastes.  Raised by hunting in
Mistmoore, or gargoyles in OOT.  I know NPC bards on the
LeagueOfAntonicanBards faction play somewhere in here, but I'm not sure if
killing them raises RoS faction or not, but killing them does raise
Mistmoore faction.

Other things on RoS faction are, Talendor in EJ, Severilous in Skyfire, the
VP 6 (Hoshkar, Nexona, Druushk, Phara Dar, Xygoz, Silverwing), the Wurms for
Wurmslayer in BurnING woods (not Burned Woods as some jokers would have you
believe =P) and a bunch of crap in Skyfire/VP.

Skyshrine is on ClawsOfVeeshan faction, only influenced hunting in Velious,
lowered in Skyshrine/WW/ToV(non-HoT)/Cobalt Scar killing dragons/drakes/etc,
but IIRC, some things in CS are on CoV faction, but don't give you
negative(or positive kael) hits; raised in Kael/EW/GD on giants.
