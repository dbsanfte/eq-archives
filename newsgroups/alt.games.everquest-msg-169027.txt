What I'm surprised no one has mentioned is PoP slow mitigation.  Almost
all of our friends are in PoP, so as far as I'm concerned, if we want to
be where things are Happening, we have to go to PoP.  And where things are
happening...slow is no longer such a blessing.

Or so I gather.  Has it really not made a difference to shaman usefulness?
