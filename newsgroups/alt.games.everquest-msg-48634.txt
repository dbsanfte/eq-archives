Win2k, on which XP is based, has a big problem with 3d sound getting jumbled
& just plain sounding bad.  Most notably (not surprising since it's the most
popular) with every SoundBlaster Live! card.  I've heard, but cannot verify,
that ALL 3d sound cards have this problem unless you pretty much disable the
only reason you BOUGHT a 3d sound card.

Some folks say that this problem is fixed in XP.  Some folks disagree.

Unless you're running Win95 or WinMe why do you want to upgrade?
