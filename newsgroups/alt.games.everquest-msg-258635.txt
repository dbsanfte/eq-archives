my necro just hit 51 (woohoo!) and i was all excited about getting my AA's,
but since this is my first character to reach 51, i wasn't quite sure how
much xp i should put towords AA's.  i asked the people in my group and one
said to wait all the way till 65 before doing any AA's, and another said to
at least wait till i leveled to start doing them.  i told them they didn't
know me very well and if they had they'd know that i wasn't gonna wait
another second to put xp toword AA.  so, ruling out the choice of waiting
till a higher level to start alternate advancement, how much xp do you think
would be a reasonable amount to put into AA's?

also, how does AA xp work?  does it go up fast in the beginning like levels
did, then sort of gradually slow down as you get more, or does it take a
long time to earn an AA point?
