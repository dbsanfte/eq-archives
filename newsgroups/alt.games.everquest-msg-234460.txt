Aye, it makes sense and you're right that SOE doesn't appear to have said
anything definitive on this (as usual).  But on further research this
doesn't seem consistent with what I'm reading elsewhere. One explanation
might be that the system was changed at some point with other changes made
to Slow, so that the above information was actually true at one time. For
example, I read in some reports that there used to be a Haste effect applied
in some situations if a slow failed or was mitigated. The example given of
Fennin Ro wiping complete raids as a result apparently caused such an uproar
that the hasting effect was complely removed from slows, and you don't ever
have to worry about that again. Another message I read suggested that the
system you describe did in fact once apply but was changed as a result of
another outcry, resulting in the current implementation.

I took a closer look at as much of the (very) anecdotal data that I could
find (I have not seen any reports of parses) and here's what I've culled
from it all. I consider this conjecture at this point, based on unconfirmed
reports, but enough of the pieces have come together from different sources
that a reliable pattern seems to be emerging, even if I'd really like to see
something more definitive. I ignored reports that said "I believe the % is
X" or "I've been told it was Y", etc, and drew mostly on reports that
actually listed test results or widely shared anecdotes about similar
experiences with particular mobs, for example. Here's what I see:

1) Slow mitigation appears be variable according to mob. That is, the
mitigation produced by Fennin Ro is different than the mitigation produced
by Quavonis (and this is true even if they produce the same "Slightly"
message).
2) Mobs carry a fixed mitigation result so that every time you successfully
slow them, they produce the same mitigation effect, a given mob doesn't vary
from time to time. E.g., Fennin Ro's may result in a 2% net Slow, while
Quavonis might result in 20%.
3) The messages ("mostly", "partially", "slightly") appear to map to certain
cutoff points along the range from 0-100%, and a given mob's effect triggers
the appropriate message. No one is sure what the cutoff points are. Many
people have suggested 75, 50, and 25, but I haven't seen any data confirming
these cutoff points. Could just as easily be 66, 50, 33, etc.

What seems to me to be a logical and likely (but a total wild-ass guess)
system is that each mob has a variable fixed percentage mitigation factor
that is applied to the spell's stated value, and that depending on where
that mob's mitigation value is within the range from 0-100%, the four
different messages are produced (mostly, partially, slightly, immune). This
is consistent with two mobs having differing mitigation factors but
producing a similiar message.

What all this suggests is that the relative ranking of class slows remains
applicable, independent of mitigation. That is, irrespective of the
particular mitigation effect of a particular mob, SHM slow is always going
to be theoretically more effective than ENC, BST or BRD (although the actual
difference may be very slight).

The most thorough treatment I've read on the topic can be found in the forum
discussions at The Shaman's Crucible, linked here:

If anyone finds anything more definitive, I'd love to see it.

Thanks,
