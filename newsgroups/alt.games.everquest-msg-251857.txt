Indys and Indigo2s are going for a song these days... My own Indy has 
been gathering dust in its fetching Indybag for a few years now, since I 
get my Unix fix from my Mac these days.

Okey, realistically, you can't do much more than read email, play Quake

nowadays, but they are still really cool boxen to have around, if you 
can afford the space, or if your computing needs are very simple.
