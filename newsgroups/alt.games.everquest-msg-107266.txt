TH was referring to Lord Grimrot of the infamous Aegis of Life quest.
Grimrot is a 200 minute static spawn, with a PH that occurs for most
(80% to 90%) of the spawns.  Further, you need to get Grimrot to spawn
once in human form (during daylight) and once in skeletal form (at
night).  Clerics (or rarely Paladins) who bite the bullet and camp Grim
can look forward to a longer camp than Ragefire for their epic, with
nothing around to get xp from, all for an ac12 wis5 cloak.  This is not
even vaguely similar to the SolA camp you refer to.
