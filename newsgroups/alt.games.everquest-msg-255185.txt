Sure, when you agree to join an LDoN the implication is that you're
going to try to complete the mission, which generally involves some
combat, so you're willing to take the risks involved in that combat.

But once the mission is complete (let's suppose it was a collect, so
you're deep in the dungeon at that point), do you immediately say,
"That's all I signed up for, let me leave the dungeon before you risk
my hard-earned xp by pulling any more mobs?"

Or earlier, if the mission is going well so there's lots of time left
and only a few more collects or kills needed to win, do you insist
that everyone med/heal up to full before the next pull, or that the
puller take all the time needed to get single pulls even though the
party has been handling doubles fine till now?  In short, do you
insist on telling everyone else how to run their characters so as to
reduce your own risk?

The point is that there are lots of things other characters do that
create some amount of risk for yours.  Different people will have
different views of what constitutes an acceptable level of risk to
expose other people to.  (And part of that is that they'll have
different views of just how risky certain actions are, as this
discussion has also shown.)  Your position has merit, but your
adamancy seems arrogant.
