Our guild on Drinal did it yesterday - a newbie pk race from Qeynos to FP.
Great fun - only three finishers out of seven starters, and I came third!
Might have got second place if I hadn't waited for a while in Kith for
daytime.
Did it all unsowed, and it only took an hour. Thats less time than some
trips by boat :) (boat vent thread above)
