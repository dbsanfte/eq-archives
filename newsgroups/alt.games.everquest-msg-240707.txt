5 of us were down there a few days ago leisurely killing Juggs and Trak wasn't
on track (or Track wasn't tracking Trak. Say that 3 times fast.). 

We got within sight of Tolapumj when the Druid said "Hey, Trak is up!" Just
about then the Enchanter's health dropped like a rock. We survived the Evac.

The last thing I remember seeing before the evac were some really, really big
teeth.
