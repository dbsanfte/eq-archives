Interestingly, when I first pre-ordered SoL from amazon.co.uk, my order
status showed as "Release 7th Delivery 10th". I checked back last week after
Verant announced the worldwide synchronised release, and my order status had
been changed to "Release 3rd Delivery 4th". I looked again earlier today,
and it was back to "Release 7th Delivery 10th".

Perhaps Amazon just found out they aren't getting them early after all, or
aren't getting enough to satisfy the pre-orders. My order was placed on 24
October, pretty soon after it was available to pre-order. If they aren't
getting enough to fulfill orders that old, there will be a lot of
disappointed people!
