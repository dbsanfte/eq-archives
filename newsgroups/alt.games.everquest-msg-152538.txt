Oh my GOD no.  My demon of thriftiness would insist I visit EACH ONE
before buying something.  Then I'd spend the rest of my EQ life
wondering if I'd missed a good deal by leaving - maybe 5 minutes later
someone put something in that other bazaar for half the price the
others are selling at!

Bad enough I do that last part in the *one* bazaar.

The problems I can see here - some morons seem to think they can sell
ruined pelts for 1pp each (yeah, I know, go figure).  Now imagine they
can just leave them there forever - and there are more and more morons
appearing each day, and they also think orc pawn picks are solid gold!

Alright, I'll stop.  But still :)  I know nothing about programming
but wouldn't keeping all that information stored *all the time* take
up an awful lot of space when multiplied by every player in EQ who
wants to sell something?

Not to mention you already get long enough lists of stuff sometimes
that you don't even see certain items up for sale.  I can only imagine
this would be aggravated if you made it so everybody had 24-7 selling
ability.
