Yes, I cancelled my EQ account and now have a Dark Age of Camelot.

Last night, I got to do my first 3+ hour named spawn camp in DAOC.  I can't
express to you how fun it was, especially when I had to fight off the
kill-stealers because we had ALL been waiting 3+ hours.  Unless this turns
out to be a one time abnormality, I won't be renewing my DAOC account.

Frankly, I won't be playing anymore MMORPGs that can't get more creative
than these artificial progress inhibitors.
