Yup, Paludal, definitely.  Problem is it gets a bit crowded but if you can
get a fair group and go deep into the caverns it won't be so bad -- just try
not to die or you'll have a hard time getting you corpse back...  After 24,
Marus Seru, most definitely.  Kill Stonegrabbers.  Then Mistmoore at about
28-32.  After that I don't know b/c I'm only lvl 31 right now :)
