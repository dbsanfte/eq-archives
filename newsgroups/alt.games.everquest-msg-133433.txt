I installed netscape 6 on my previous machine and found it to be
intolerable bloatware with no redeming new features and wanted
to force me to learn what looked like new ways of doing everything
for no reason.  Since I keep up with Windoze updates, I have
more than enough of this in my life.  When I got the new machine
I happily installed 4.7 and left well enough alone.

If 6 lets me pretend I'm using 4.7 somehow, and adds new features
without torturing me with a new system of use, I suppose I should
try it again.  After all, this system is much faster and has far more
memory, perhaps I won't notice the incredible bloat so much.
