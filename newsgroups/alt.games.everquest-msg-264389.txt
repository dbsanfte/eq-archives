Yes of course. But if the enchanter is freed to nuke some, is that worth 
the 6.25% the monk is missing out on?

Even if the enchanter nukes don't compensate for the 6.25% dps, they 
definately shift the balance of this equation. ie if the enchanter nukes 
only account for 5% of the 6.25% the tradeoff for 'insurance' is now 
1.25%.

Unless the enchanter nuking can actually exceed the 6.25% lost dps... in 
which case you actually end up further ahead with the enchanter nukes. 
Toss in the reduced risk of wiping and its a no brainer.

Plus without the extra mobs in camp there will be a reduced load on the 
cleric too (as the puller/tanks won't have to absorb the extra unslowed 
mobs for the few seconds it takes to lock them down, which ultimatly 
adds another opportunity for 'inefficient nuking' by the cleric. =) 
Between the enchanter and the cleric nuking, I'm comfortable that there 
is at least a decent liklihood that this more than makes up for the 
small loss of puller dps.
