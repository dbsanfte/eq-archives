    I'm just guessing, but he's fighting an ice burrower, one of those worm
things in Western Wastes. Anyone that's fought a big worm-model mob knows
the bounding box (the area you can actually hit) on one of them is small,
and buried inside the mob. So I imagine he had a lot of moving back and
forth, trying to hit the damn thing.
