I know Sony doesn't like use of 3rd party software with EQ, but I remember
reading a post about a plugin for Winamp that allows it to be controlled
using the command line interface of EQ (you type a command into the chat
window and instead of effecting EQ it effects Winamp to allow you to change
playlists, or play MP3s, ect...).  What was this?  Does it still work?  I
remember reading something about Sony approving of the program since it
doesn't effect EQ in any way.  Was that also true?  I wish they would
eventually give the option to use the game music or use a playlist file
instead of the in-game music (still be able to hear background sounds of
mobs and other, but instead of area music play the playlist).
