That information has been false for over 2 years now.

No, really, I'm serious.

I think a lot of folks here know how much I like the rogue
class.  I've played rogues (almost) exclusively, and
DEFINATELY as my only serious characters for over 3 years
now.

Coin/item loot USED to come from a separate pool.  If
a rogue was bored or masochistic, he could theoretically
pick a billion plat from the same orc pawn, albeit in
denominations of copper coins.  Then kill the orc and
loot the 2 copper on his corpse.

No longer.

Pick anything.  Stand there and pick it all day.  You'll
pick it down to 1 coin of each denomination of whatever
loot it had.  An orc pawn may be carrying some copper,
pickpocket it for 24 hours, your last successful attempt
will have DEFINATELY been 1 copper and when you kill
it the corpse will have 1 copper left.  This is following
a million "unsuccessful" picks.

A Shralock orc in Kithicor may be carrying some silver
and some copper.  Pickpocket it for 24 hours, your
last successful silver pick will be 1 silver and your
last successful copper pick will be 1 copper.  When
you kill it the corpse will have 1 silver 1 copper left.
This is following a million "unsuccessful" picks.

An orc medic in Highpass Hold may be carrying some
gold, some silver, and some copper.  Pickpocket it for
24 hours, your last successful gold pick will be 1 gold,
your last successful silver pick will be 1 silver, and your
last successful copper pick will be 1 copper.  Kill it and
the corpse will have 1 gold 1 silver 1 copper. This is
following a million "unsuccessful" picks.

Hopefully you get the idea.  This is not up for debate.
This is not wishful thinking.  This is not fantasy.  This
is fact that anybody with a rogue over level 10 should
have figured out already.  This is fact:

PICKPOCKET LOOT USED TO COME FROM A SEPARATE
LOOT POOL BUT THIS WAS CHANGED AND ALL LOOT
NOW COMES FROM THE SAME POOL!!!

Sorry to shout, but I don't want you to get another rogue
a bad rep by spreading misinformation.  The change was
literally yearS (yes, multiple of "year") ago.  This was
changed around the same time that it was coded to not
allow you to pick magic or no drop items, or Disarm a
magic weapon onto the ground (as in, wouldn't it be fun
to get a monk to train Tormax to the WL zone line while
you and he then proceeded to disarm that Horn of Hsegra,
scoop it up, and zone?).

It's just the way the game evolved, for good or bad.  It's
just the facts of pickpocket today.
