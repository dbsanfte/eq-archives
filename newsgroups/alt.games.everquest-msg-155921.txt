}Okay, but *you* have to be Mr. Pink.

Dang, what is it with eq newsgroups?  About a month ago I watched The 
Usual Suspects for the first time, right before the whole "page 8" deal 
hit, and everyone was referring to it.  I just saw Reservoir Dogs for the 
first time like 3 days ago...

Are you people monitoring my viewing habits, or what?

And yeah, I'm fine with being Mr. Pink.  Buscemi is such a whiner.
