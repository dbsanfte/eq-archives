As cheap as it is, RAM is a great upgrade when it comes to bang for the
buck.  I'm a little over-RAMd with 544meg, since my processor is only a Cel
300a ( OCd to 450 ) and my video is a 2.5 year old 32meg ATI Rage Fury.

I'm doing my best to hold out until NwN gets released before I upgrade, but
I don't know if I'm going to make it.  I'll probably buy a 1gig ( fastest my
mobo will take ) to hold me over, and then a GeForce3 right at NwN release
to get it as cheaply as possible.
