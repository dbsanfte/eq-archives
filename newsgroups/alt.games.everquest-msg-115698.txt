 That's not that big of a mistake. Most of the mobs we take on these
days are red cons to us. I'm not even sure the triggered Faydedar is
level 60. I know the real one is since all the other wandering Kunark
Dragons are 60 but I thought the triggered one wasn't as high.

 He will despawn after awhile if he's not aggroed. I think it's an hour
but can't say for sure.
