Sometimes it can get tricky to get the NPC to give the quest.

For the bard mail quests the keyword are Interested and Mail.

Saying "interested mail" wont get you anwhere, but saying "i am interested
in delivering your mail" will get you the next quest. The phrase "I am
interested in eating your mail" will also work.

Then keywords for next sencence wil be Mail and City name.
Again, "mail kelethin" will not work, but "yes, i will deliver your mail to
Kelethin" will work. And "No, i will not deliver your mail to kelethin, ill
eat it instead" will also work.

Thats one of the quest you can have a LOT of fun with saying the wierdest
things to get it.
