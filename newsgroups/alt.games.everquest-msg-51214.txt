Excellent post which addresses what I have seen so far with only a
couple of months play in the game.  When powerful gear becomes
available to players of an inappropriate level then gameplay becomes
easier.  The game is dumbed down.  The game I play today where gear
can be bought for a song and items such as bat wings sell for a
fortune (5pp a stack, imagine that!)... I imagine that this is quite a
different game from the one all you old timers played a couple of
years ago when EQ was new.  At level 13 there is no reason for me to
go to Crush Bone and camp the throne room.  I don't need anything
those guys drop.  Bought better stuff in EC with the proceeds from a
couple of hours of lion hunting.   Seems to me that this is an
unforseen side effect of a poor game economy model, and I think it
diminishes game play.
