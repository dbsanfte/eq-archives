This is the same experience I've had with the cleric class, there's a 
large array of things you can do, often a more effective use of your 
mana pool than healing.  But most of the time, what people want from you 
is healing, and they usually bring the other tools to the party on 
classes who are more, well, expected, to do those things.  If you're 
feeling lazy, you can in 90% of cases sit and heal and do as well as 
anyone expects you to.

Being able, when the balloon goes up, to play all the myriad other 
tricks of the class, doesn't take away from the laziness of the bulk of 
the time.

I'm hoping that wizard is similar, that I'll be capable of significantly 
more but able to deliver whats expected of me in normal situations while 
wrapping the handles on swords or sorting thru reciepts or filling pay 
envelopes.

Another factor of the cleric, in this regard, was that soloing meant 
half a minute of action followed by three minutes of sitting to recover.

SK soloing was similar, except that there's a big difference between HP 
and Mana; to recover mana you sit on your butt and do nothing.  To 
recover HP, you sit and punch the bind wounds button every few seconds.

I'm hoping that as a wizard, I'll be in the same boat as a cleric 
insofar as soloing goes., burn thru my mana on a kill, then sit quietly 
out of the way and recover, giving me plenty of time to do something 
else.  Oh, and eventually, to find that to actually be an effective way 
to get exp; on a cleric or SK, soloing is really pretty slow going.
