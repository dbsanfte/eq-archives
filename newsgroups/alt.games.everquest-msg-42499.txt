TwoHead,

You are correct, the high levels do have some what of an envious stance in this.
But there is a suttle difference between the two groups of envious people.

TCC is a restriction. It is a limitation. It is designed to restrict people from
doing something they want to do because other people are envious of what they
have and can do.

The lack of TCC is not a restriction. It is not a limitation. It is the freedom
to do what you desire as long as you are work to that goal. Want to camp an
item? Well, get the resources that you need together when it is free and go camp
it. Nothing stopping you. No restriction on level. If you are low level, get a
group and go get the item. If you are high level, go get the item. No
restrictions to your desires.

That is the difference between the two envious stances. One is a restriction due
to a few people being envious. The other is a lack of restrictions due to a few
people being envious.

The sad thing about this story that I see is that all of those that favor the
TCC are being so short sided in their views. Every single one of them will
quickly find themselves outside of the range that can get these items long
before they ever get a chance to go for the item. And they will be out of luck
just like the rest of them.

The "true" newbie will not have the oppertunity to get these items when they are
of the level necessary and will have to wait a long time before they can get the
means to get them with the multiple characters and dual accounts. Remember back
when you were a newbie? If you were a wood elf, were you exploring Upper Guk at
level 15? At 16? By 20 or so, you would not be able to get many of the items you
so desire without buying them.
