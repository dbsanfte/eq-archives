I am not really making choices in that case, I am simply following the 
program that was put into place when the universe was created.

Green is a physically measurable property of light.  There is no error 
involved, either the light has that physical property, or it does not.  
If we discuss what color the light looks like, then, there is no right or 
wrong, if we discuss what color the light is, then, it is green, 
regardless of what color any given individual percieves it to be.  It has 
nothing to do with majority opinion, it does have to do with agreeing on 
what the definition of green is.  If our definitions of what green is do 
not match, then, obviously, it will be difficult to come to any agreement 
on whether or not a light is green.
