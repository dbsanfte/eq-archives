Heh. One of the computers where I work picks up noise from the *mouse*.

For myself, I can only say that I am astonished and somewhat terrified 
at the results of this evening's experiments.  Astonished at the 
wonderful power you have developed, and terrified at the thought that so 
much hideous and bad music may be put on record forever.
