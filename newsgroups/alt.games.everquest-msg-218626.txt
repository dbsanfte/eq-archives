- Find Feature added.  This will create a mystical indication of the path to
take to find certain people.  This feature works in the Bazaar and in newbie
zones and cities.  In the Bazaar you just click on the merchant you seek in the
Bazaar window and click the Find Trader button.  For all other uses, just hit
CTRL+F to open the window, select someone on the list and click the Find
button.  This will locate any Bazaar trader or any NPC with an alternate name,
such as (Spell Vendor).  The exception is that it will not locate NPCs in the
Wayfarer's Camps.

Can someone explain this?  Can't quite figure out how to find the NPC's in the
starting cities...  LOL

Just made a Vah Shir BL alt and this would be REALLY helpful... hehe
