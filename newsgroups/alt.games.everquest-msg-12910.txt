Whether something sucks or not is totally in the mind of the person saying
it.

Post level 50 a necromancer's role in raids dramatically changes.  Instead
of being damage dealers they're relegated to being support instead.  Since
many necros are rather antisocial this forced socializing may be considered,
to them, as "sucking."

If you play a grouping necro with only the group in mind then it probably
wouldn't "suck."
