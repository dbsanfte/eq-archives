Sort of. Actually it will boost you to a certain range depending on the span
between your levels. If the level difference is extreme, you'll wind up at
MentorLevel - 4, and in those cases where it's close you'll be at
MentorLevel - 1. I forget the actual breakpoints.

It's a great idea that allows players of any level to group together and
still get experience that is roughly proportional to their level. Also, you
can't use it to enter zones that have a level requirement you don't meet.
