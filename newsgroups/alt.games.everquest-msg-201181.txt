The only tripe I see is you intentionally trying to mislead in your
original response, and then trying to worm your way out of it in the
follow-ups.

>Fact: I was taking down 2 Large Zelniaks

Soloing "multiple reds" is not the same as killing more than 1 red per
bar of mana. Which is what you implied in your first post. You
subsequent replies do not address the issue within the context of the
thread, and avoid the point on contention entirely.

You didn't include any context in your first post, and your reponse to
my query didn't address my questions which were based on the original
context of the first poster (the power of a level 28 necro) and your
first response ("My druid was soloing multiple reds at a time at that
level.". )

The thread is the context. You have made unsubstantiated claims, and
your "evidence" was based on spells not available to a druid at level
28. If you were not specifically referring to a level 28 druid, then
the mistake is yours because the original poster was referring
specifically to the soloing power of a 28 necro. I won't waste any
more time quoting your exact words, because you seem to have a problem
remembering what you wrote.

>Thanks for the recap of this thread to date, now try actually replying.

I'll reply to your "question" just as soon as you drop all the crap
and admit that you made an unsubstantiated statement and then
backpedalled when called on it. You are the one making statements out
of the context of the thread, and then trying to win an argument by
taking it off topic. Better luck next time.
