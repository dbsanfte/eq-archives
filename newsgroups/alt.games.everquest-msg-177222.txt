I can only comment on the rogue aspect. I have a 54 rogue.
I have a blast. Admittedly I have decent equipment so I can actually act as
a tank when no one else is around.

You don't want to be the main tank though since you are loosing all your BS
damage until the mob is running. I can sneak/hide through mobs others can't
get by because you may be going where you would need invis and invis to
undead (our hide works on both). Also it does not drop unless we do
something to drop it.

You are dependant upon groups, but a group can consist of only you and a
shaman/druid/cleric., again you would want another tank for best results.

At higher levels, people will want you for your DPS (damage per second).

Clerics in my opinion did not offer as much to do in the long run (started
upon release). Now clerics have other options than just healing, though that
is what groups will want you to do. Personally I would not play a cleric
unless I was 2 boxing one, so I could do something the rest of the time.

One character you might like is shaman. They have bufs, heals, and
eventually a pet. You can solo if the mood grabs you and most groups want
you. Even at low levels your slow helps as do the dots. I have a 54 shaman
as well and I enjoy playing him as well.

Bottom line though is every class CAN be fun, if you let it. Try em both to
about 20, head to Pauld Caverns in the teens and you should get a pretty
good indication of how the classes work.

Last piece of advice, if this is your first EQ character you are picking two
characters that everyone will tell you how to play even if they do not play
one. This is partially true with every class (there is always someone in a
group "who plays a high level X and knows better") but cleric and to a
lesser extent a rogue seem to be high on the "helpful" comments from the
peanut gallery.
