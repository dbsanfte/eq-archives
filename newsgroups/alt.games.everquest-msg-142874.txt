   Does Taellaar have the ability to cast Divine Aura?  Because that's
the only thing that keeps Teapray alive.
   Anyways, no.  I don't really have much desire to read stories of my
husband engaged in any male/male action.  Or any action at all, for that
matter.  Yeah, I know.  I'm uptight.

to read it.
