Most people I see using it do so in mockery, not intending to be taken
seriously.

When some relatively valueless item drops, we often refer to it as l33t, for
example, or when we are killing a low level mob required for someone's epic,
we'll claim we are there for the phat l3wts.

From time to time, someone I don't know will send me a tell along the lines of
"wil u rez me plz".  This does not warrant a reply.  On the other hand, when
my buddies send me the same sort of request, I know them well enough to know
that they are merely yanking my proverbial chain.
