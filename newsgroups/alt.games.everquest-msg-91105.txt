Don't worry about the barroom - at the top of the stairs on the left of the
house (when facing it from the zone tunnel), in the closet there is usually
a crazed that pops there.  That's where I got mine with the help of a kind
druid.

Nope, the "a skeletons" are not that deep in and were easy for me to do as a
22nd level paladin.

Not really - as a level 22, I managed to complete the quest in a few hours
after the "fix" patch - granted with the help of some kinds souls.  One
shouted in BB that the piece off the goblin (forgot what part) was rotting
away and come and get it if anyone wanted it.  There was no way even in a
group at 22 I could have gotten it (or would have been a very bad fight) and
a very nice druid ported me into Lavastorm (I play on a PvP server so going
through Neriak would be certain death) and than babysat me while I cleared
things up but we were only in Najena for about 15 minutes before the hilt
dropped.  And of course the 30+ druid who dropped the crazed when no one
else was in Unrest - but in a good group at 22 would have been possible.

Am I happy? - of course!  Nothing like a few good procs of the ghoulbane to
lay waste to an undead :)
