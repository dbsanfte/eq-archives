I priced my Newbie Justice armor at about twice what a reasonable
price would be, and priced Jugs of Sauces at 1pp each, and have sold
from both suplys on occasion. Not because I'm actually trying to sell
them, but I've run out of room in my bank (tradeskills) and so I drop
them in the 4 trader bags I have. I'm really just storeing them until
I need to use them for some reason, but if someone comes over and buys
them at the outrageous prices I've got them at, so much the better.

The moral of the story is that on occasion there is a person with more
money than paitence, and they may buy something that otherwise would
be completely outrageous in price.

Oh, and as an aside, I'm a master smith so if you still need any
banded armor send Ceod a tell. I'll make it for you for the cost of
the materials. (Or if I'm in a good mood, like I just sold 300 spider
silks, I may do it for free.) =)

If you have broadband, just leave the computer on while you sleep or
go to work. It's more difficult to do with dial up but can be done, if
you have a second line and are the only person that uses the computer.
