Here's how everything is:
* TEQIM - Trillian Pro 2.x plugin, yes it requires pro 2.0, because
anything prior to this does not support plugins for mediums (meaning
it supported plugins, but you couldn't make a plugin for it to connect
to another service, like EQIM)
* EQIMu - Text client, console mode.  Runs on all versions of Windows
as well as linux.  You run it, and instructions are given as to how to
connect and log in.  Once logged in, usage is 99% the same as it would
be in game.  ";help" shows ; commands, ";1" talks on channel 1, etc. 
The main difference is that your ";buddy" list actually shows you
buddy status changes.
* EQIMd - IRC *server* (emulator).  Also runs on all versions of
Windows as well as linux.  It emulates an IRC server, so that you can
connect to it with any standard IRC client (mIRC, BitchX, X-Chat,
etc).  Once connected to an EQIMd server, you enter commands to log in
to EQIM.  Once logged in to EQIM, you can use standard IRC commands to
join channels, send tells, etc.  Any number of people can use the same
EQIMd server to log into EQIM.  However, do NOT connect to advertised
or public EQIMd servers, because logging into EQIM through EQIMd sends
your (encrypted) password through the EQIMd host computer.  In other
words, only use EQIMd servers you trust not to take advantage of
having your encrypted password.

So... to set up EQIMd on your computer so that you can connect to it
with an IRC client... you run EQIMd (this explanation is for Windows),
pick your poisons (irc port, password, irc-op password, etc) and hit
Start.  Minimize it.  Open up your IRC client, and connect to server
"localhost" (if you set a password in EQIMd, make sure the IRC client
is set up to use it!).  Once connected, read the message of the day
for instructions on logging into EQIM and basic EQIMd usage.
