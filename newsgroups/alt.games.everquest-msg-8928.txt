Felt like I was getting caught up in the leveling grind, so I decided Friday
to do some dungeons and have some different adventures.  Threw together a
pickup group of mid 20's to go fight in Najena...  Group was kinda helter
skelter and we wound up in a few places over our heads (even with a full
group).  Luckily a high lvl cleric gave us all a rez (very nice guy to port
in and help us).

Since Sol A was nearby, we decided to give that a shot.   Man O' man, just
the entrance spawned like 7 or 8 gobs who were pretty tough.  I wound up
falling into the lava :-(  and spent another life getting corpse out.  We
never got passed the doorway.

Went back to Najena Sat. with a better organized group and we spent alot of
time killing BoneCracker and Ogre Guards.  That went really well and I
actually managed to get my level back I had lost on Fri., and pick up the
remaining bronze pieces I needed for my complete set   :-)

Although, I didn't even come out ahead in exp. it was still alot of fun...
and very different fighting in dungeons.
