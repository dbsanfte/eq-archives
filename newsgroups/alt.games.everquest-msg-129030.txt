What if we have it all backwards?  What if "god" and "heaven" are where we
are going regardless?  What if there is NOTHING TO DO?  Just live, make
choices, learn from your experiences, and grow.  Anarchy?  Yes, but if it
doesn't really matter anyway, and all choices eventually evolve into an
acknowledgement of results, then wisdom could intervene.  If you throw
yourself from a building it isn't the judgment of God that you die, it's
just a natural result.  Ever action has a reaction, and if we begin to live
our lives with intention, knowing the results of our actions, or at least
the possible results and stop trying to follow a set code of laws that
involve guilt and judgment, wouldn't we all be better off?  This would drop
out the arguing and militant fighting that comes along with religions trying
to say they have it "right" and others have it "wrong."

Morality:  If it benefits you and the world around you, DO IT.  If it hurts
you and the world around you, DON'T.

Could be argued that who is to decide these things, but I believe that deep
down inside we all know what will hurt us and what won't.  Doesn't take a
God, or a ten commandments, or even Jesus himself to show us what that is.

Just my opinion, I could very easily be wrong.
