I'm really happy with this new addition.  Of course it pertains more to the
Bard's attention IMHO than for any other class, but it's pretty welcome.
When I've had umpteen buffs thrown on me, a couple dot's from the mobs,
etc...it's a little tough sometimes to keep an eye on your song icons that
seem to patch holes in the spell effects box at random.
Now if only they would give us another instrument skill...say maybe a piano.
No Bard could physically carry it, but it certainly would look cool to whip
out a piano and sing "Leave On" in the middle of combat.

Sean...
