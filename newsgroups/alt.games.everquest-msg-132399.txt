Well, my best guess is that the Accord will get better MPG and break less 
often.  Accord parts are probably more expensive, but then you factor in 
that I'm much more likely to get a warranty on a new car...

What I'd probably -actually- do is look at how much I could sell either 
car for today, take the one that sells for more, sell it, and buy an 89 
Camry for 3K.  Then go on holiday in Europe with the change. :)

}Dangit, you blew my plan.

Oops. :)
