I've been using eq.gamepressure.com and eq2.ogaming.com.  Allakhazam's EQ2 
site is ok.  The eqtraders EQ2 site isn't too bad, they've got as much up 
to date as they can and they get regular reports from EQ2 producers.  

Don't really know of any others but then those have been good enough for me 
so far.
