As far as I'm aware they don't have Ring spells (self-only) for anywhere in
Velious except Iceclad...at least, castersrealm doesn't list them.

Ring of Iceclad and Circle of Combines (Dreadlands) can be found in gypsy
camps (NK is probably most convenient).  Other Velious Circle spells are
found in Wakening Lands (beware Wuoshi).  RING of Combines is found at least
at Kelethin druid guild.

All other self-ports are in WC, and group ports in Toxx.  PRETTY sure I'm
not missing any....
