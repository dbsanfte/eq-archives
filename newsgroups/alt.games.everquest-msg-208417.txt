Your understanding is incorrect. There is no end to EQ save when/if
the day comes that SOE closes shop on the project and shuts down the
servers. "End game mobs" refers to mobs that are the most difficult
challenges currently in the game and require a full raid force of
level 61+ players to bring down (and a LOT of tactics). What happens
when they die? People get xp, loot, and bragging rights. Then the mob
respawns in a few hours/days/weeks.
