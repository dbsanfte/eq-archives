There is no extra advantage I know of just from it being plate.  For 
two identical pieces in terms of AC/HP/Mana/Stats/Effects I'd go for 
the cheapest or the easiest to get.  As far as I know weight is 
unimportant unless you're a monk.  If there's not much difference on 
those scores then whatever looks best ;)  

I wouldn't expect the situation to arise often though.  In general gear 
from the same places that is equally difficult to get the AC won't be 
the same it will be Plate>Chain>Leather, and stats will vary somewhat.
