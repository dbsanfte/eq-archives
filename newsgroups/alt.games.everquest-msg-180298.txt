I don't hate EQ because it lacks a feature I'd like to see, you can't make
everyone happy especially with software.  Although I will admit the panning
does lack in getting a good close up without (as you mentioned) getting
close to a wall or something.

SoE seems to be putting alot of working into improving some of the smaller
things in EQ, so maybe this is on their list somewheres.
