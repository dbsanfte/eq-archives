When I did that quest I found out that not all the merchants are on the same
faction. Some liked me after doing the quest but there was a lot that still
didn't.  Also, since then some one told me they nerfed the quest some how or
maybe it was just the item you get from doing the quest.  Not sure how true
it is though.
