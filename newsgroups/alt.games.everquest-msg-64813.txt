I ran into the "Local File IO error" on one of my XP boxes three times with
the same file while downloading, each time having to restart the download.
Finally, I opened the "EverQuest" directory and found that there were
actually TWO identical entries for the file (can't remember its name now)
mentioned in the IO error line. Duplicate file names are a no no on any file
system and shouldn't occur.  I deleted one of the duplicate names and
restarted the download. Didn't encounter this particular problem again.
