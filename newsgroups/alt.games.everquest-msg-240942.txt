Got in touch with a guide... after 4 hours. He said he'd pass it on
up...

I'm logging out tho for the evening...guide said "I may have to
repetition next time I log in if it wasn't resolved.".

Frustrating as hell, but no point taking it out on a guide.. that's
what usenet is for :p. Hope its resolved soon though... I miss my
stuff... though at least it wasn't my main.
