Nothingk in Dreadlands will affect your VS faction, only parts of
Kaesora, Karnor's and (all of?) Charsis will as far as I know. 

If you take the PoK book down to OT, you can stay out of agro range
and con the golem that's pretty close to there. If he isn't KOS,
you're fine in the outpost. 

Only other option I can think of is to have someone else buy it for
you.
