I'm not going to argue whether acronyms are words or not. that wasn't my
point. my point was: CIA, NSA, USAF, and DoD most certainly ARE acronyms

the person I responded to said they weren't. and I was indicating that that
poster was incorrect in that regard.

if you're going to argue whether or not an acronym is a word, take that up
with Merriam Webster, not me. It's their definition I quoted.
