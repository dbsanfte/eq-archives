A month ago I tried to do this quest with a cleric friend (cidric).  I think
I was more interested in it than him but we managed to do the first symbol
quest and most of the second.   Second involves a drop in unrest from undead
brewer and then off to oasis and kith.  Sadly, he lost interest about there
(I wanted the booze supply)  We found most of our information in Allakazam's
but under the discussion part of the beastiary section.  Try searching the
undead brewer in unrest.
