Hell, if you have so much RAM you can place the texture cache in a RAM
disk, the easiest way would be to write a DOS batch to copy the entire
EQ directory to RAM and execute the program from there. As long as the
RAM drive is a valid drive letter, EQ doesn't care where it runs from,
and it writes the texture cache to its own directory. We're talking
about having at least 3GB of RAM for this to work, though...
