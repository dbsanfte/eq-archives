I think I could crap plat for a week and still not be able to afford a
horse.  But yeah, I think a horse might be the anti-sadness. heh

Friday night, EQ down and can't think of anything else to do; that's ok.
When I do get on, I got a horsie!

I hate to do this but it reminded me of my favorite bad joke.

What does an old horse say when it's fallen down?

Help I've fallen and I can't giddy up.
