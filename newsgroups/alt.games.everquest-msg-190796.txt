    Well I have to say pullers aren't exactly enamoured with the conept
either...

    Yes in my 40's I realised that every cleric I was grouping with had
CHeal and wasn't using it because we tanks simply lacked the hitpoints. I
found that turning up with Aego where possible therefore made a huge double
contribution to the group - far tougher tank plus cleric heals moved from
expensive to efficient.

    Well if a group is fear kiting successfully a cleric is in fact made
redundant. Less a matter of keeping in range to heal and more a matter of
not having any damage to heal. However, I've yet to be in a full group (been
in many full or 5 person groups that lacked a cleric or even a serious
healer) that was willing to fear kite, which is a real shame because a group
consisting of say a shammy or chanter, a bard, an sk/necro and 3 DPS melees
would absolutely annihilate mobs. SK/necro could pull after fearing, leaving
the DPS members to complete the kill.

    I feel at least the example above, if perhaps not the whole concept,
would be a bandaid solution to the basic lack of balance between classes. As
an SK being accepted into groups more because of the fact that mobs
slow-flee earlier than because of my other abilities, especially ones that
actually require intelligent input from me, would really suck. My
desirability in a group over a really crap SK would be diminished.

    If they're not viable for grouping 61+, whether they can solo or not, it
needs to be addressed.

    I would agree with both of those statements, however once again it was
an example illustrating a point, not an attempt to paraphrase grouping and
looking for a group. Pre pop, warriors are usually more desired in a group.

    I'm all for that but you'd have to be adding a serious amount of agro
per taunt. At 52 I've got a spell that's a one second cast and a few seconds
recast that adds as much agro as hitting the mob for 400 points. One more
level and I get one to add to that that does 450. One or two of those is
enough to keep the mob on me through a cast of slow and other debuffs and
snares by other members of the group. Taunt would need to be adding serious
amounts of agro to compete with that. But then, we dont need it 100%
competing, and I definitely don't want it 100% competition, all we need is
for warriors to be a viable tank for pop again, if indeed they aren't now.

    Yet he's better at it than an SK or paladin, and adding a burst of
damage would both increase his agro abilities and serve the more obvious
purpose of hurting the mob.

    My raving and foaming at the mouth sort of behavior in this thread isn't
about preventing warriors from being viable, its in response to people's
insistence that warriors be better than SK's and paladins at:

    1) dps
    2) tanking
    3) agro

    Making them the tank of choice for both raids and ALL grouping
situations, for the sole justification that SK's and pallies can solo -
badly. It's flagrantly unfair and I've spent a huge amount of time
reiterating that simply because it never seems to sink in, and as soon as
one person goes quiet about it or steps back from the extremist view that
warriors should basically erase the knight classes, someone else steps up to
the plate and lets fly with the precise same bullshit. I'm worried that SOE
might actually be listening to this attitude and will either nerf knight
classes (the easiest thing to do) or improve warrior agro management to the
point where they're ahead of knights - rendering my class and my brother
class a very second class class.

Cheers,
James
