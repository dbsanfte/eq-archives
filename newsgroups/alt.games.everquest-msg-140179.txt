Just wanna see whether I'm going in the right direction equipment-wise.  
here's my Ally's profile:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/userinfo.html?char=244451

(And if you want to hear a "today was a GOOD day" story, look at my 
equipment :D)

I got yelled at for concentrating on stats ;) so here's a "how'm I doin, 
boss?" post.

Also, planning on upgrading shoulders to mrylokar's vambraces (that'll 
take a bit of work as they're about 2k, but I'm getting nearer to 
handmade backpack level, and I've found spider silks and pelts sell 
nicely in the bazaar), and the sebilite scale mantle to a tattered 
mantle (as soon as the price goes down again - typically when I didn't 
have any money, I saw them as low as 75pp, usually around 100, 150.  At 
this moment 2 people are selling one - 350pp, and *1k*pp (insane? yes).  
I'm willing to wait, I have things to sell anyway.  One thing I was a 
little unsure of, I *was* wearing boots of scale but I switched to 
Kylong Boots.  Lost me HP though, which seems... kind of backward.  It's 
a 3AC difference though, so...

Also, weapons-wise, when I feel like working on other skills I'll switch 
the spider fang for an ebonwood cudgel, or a polished granite tomahawk 
(which I picked up without even realizing what it was :) was just 
killing the gnolls as I ran through HHP for a bit of extra faction, and 
- ooh, a named gnoll, wonder what he drops... OOOH, str buffing 1hs!).  
Should I bother with hand to hand?

Annnnd finally, pottery is getting close to 200.  I can't think of any 
reason why it *shouldn't* be one I GM at, but if anybody has any reasons 
not to... (only one I can think of is that I'm agnostic, and I think 
that prevents me from making *any* of the religious items, right?)

Ryou
