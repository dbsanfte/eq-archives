Pet healing aggro is vanishingly small.  Only thing I've ever gotten
aggro on by healing a pet were adds when I was soloing.. and even that,
only early on, when the pet had not yet sufficiently annoyed the other
mobs attacking him.

But I guess when the AE damage is the only thing he's taking, and its
very large, ignoring a couple hits would make a lot of difference, and I
could reapply the guard so as to avoid the next one.  With some mobs,
this only hits once every 30 seconds, predicatably, so Guard would be a
full minute worth of AE protection... if its duration is that long.

If we are talking about something that would flat out kill him when it 
hit, and is infreqent but cyclical, it would probably be worthwhile. 
People rarely heal pets, saving the mana for PC's, I find, unless its 
-me- healing my own pet.

Same complaint.  I did about 50% LDoN thru level 55, then cut down to 
where I spend about 10% of my time in LDoNs.  Thats a lot of points to 
someone my level, where I'm seeing 22 points or so per success.  And 
I've never done a single Guk mission, pass -nor- fail.

Splendid
