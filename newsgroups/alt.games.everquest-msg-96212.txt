I usually kite with:
Solon's (charm)
Consonant (slow/snare)
Fufills or Chords (dot)
I usually don't fear myself because I do want my pet to take damage.  Easier
for me to finish them off after.  I personally only fear unwanted adds, as I
don't like chasing mobs around and potentially running into more mobs.  As
long as the mob your charm is beating on is slowed/rooted you should be ok
and not have to twist 3-4 songs.

Happy Barding,
SEAN...
