It's called genocide, which would be kind of ironic, considering that
Israel claims to be made up of people who escaped the same thing happening
to them.

There probably wouldn't be that many Israelis left either. Such 
a threat would spur more suicide bombings, if there was any chance
of the Palesinians getting hold of nukes (either through another
Arab country or by stealing from Israel) then they would attempt
to use them.

Most likely even the USA's unconditional support of Israel would
crack in that situation. But probably not until there was a high
body count already.
