My biggest complaint is that the bazaar and barter zones are separate.  That
dooms the barter zone to be underutilized I think, but we'll see.

My secondary complaint is that the new bazaar zone is needlessly complex.  I
literally had to zoom the map in and pay very close attention to it to find
my way back out.  I'm sure after I've been there a few times that won't be
much of an issue, but I didn't need any map at all to find my way around the
old bazaar on day one.
