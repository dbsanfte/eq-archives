As a young Ranger, archery is mostly worthless.  Use it to pull if you
like, and possibly to help when soloing.  But a Ranger will not be any
good with a bow until at least level 55, and really not til level 59
with a bunch of AA's.  Until then you will almost always do more
damage with your swords, clubs, and daggers.

As for common mistakes...

-At your level, you are pretty much just as good at taking damage as
anybody, but as you level up, you will become kind of a paper tiger. 
In your 50's, the difference between your defensive skills and
hitpoints and those of Warriors, Paladins, and SK's will be very
noticeable.  The problem is that while you aren't all that good at
getting hit, you are good at making the mob want to hit you.  This is
a massive topic to cover: agro control.  You may want to start another
thread.  But let me just say that even at level 17, you will find that
people are already going to be bitching at you to stop taking agro. 
(Meaning stop making the monster attack you instead of someone else). 
Like I said, you are just as good as anyone, at that level, taking
hits.  However the Ranger stigma will still apply.

-Forgetting to snare.  Wait until the monster is around 50% health,
then make sure and snare it.  Forgetting to snare can create all kinds
of problems, and in certain places will kill your entire group.

-Don't break mez.  Remember that casting a root will also break mez
(at your level).  Your roots do damage, which wakes the monster up.

-Be careful with damage over time spells (AKA DoT's).  Right now you
have a spell called flame lick.  If an enchanter is in the group, put
that spell away or be very careful about casting it only on the
monster that you should be attacking.  A damage over time spell makes
a mob essentially unmezzable because it keeps hitting the monster
until it wears off.

That's all the "do-not's" I could think of at the moment.


So what is your function in a group?  Outdoors you will be great at
pulling.  You get spells (Harmony and Harmony of Nature) that make it
so that monsters will not attack you unless you attack them or get
right on top of them.  So if two are standing next to each other, you
can harmony one and pull the other back to your group.

You are a snarer.  You will get the best snare spells in the game. 
(long duration and low mana cost).  Use them wisely.

You are a tracker.  Use track and use it often.  Get your skill up as
high as you can and learn how track works.

You are a damage dealer.  You will not do the most damage in a typical
group but you will do more than Paladins, Shadowknights, a lot of
Warriors, Necromancers, etc...

You will be getto croud control.  (The person who seperates the
monsters so that only one is attacking your group at a time.)  If you
have no enchanter, snare a monster and run it away from the group. 
Root it.  Now he is parked until needed.

You will get some nice buffs later on.  SoW will be your first great
buff at level 30.  You will also get some nice spells that increase
melee damage output for your group.  (attack buffs).  Damage shields
as well.  A reasonable AC buff.  A hitpoint buff that will stack with
other hitpoint buffs.  (Assuming no Beastlord or Paladin is around.)

You will get a few utility spells, such as the ability to see through
the eyes of monsters.  This allows you to look around in areas by
jumping from monster to monster, seeing what they see.  You can
sometimes explore an entire zone using this spell, without leaving the
entrance.
