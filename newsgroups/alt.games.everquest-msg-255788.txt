I've barely been following this because it really doesn't relate to me 
but I have to disagree with what you just wrote there. It is NOT *time* 
that determines whether one is a power gamer or not. Time is a factor, 
but it is not *the* factor. Being a "powergamer" is much more about 
playing the game at the very limits of the envelope than it is about 
logged hours.

I easily put in 20 hours a week on EQ since I started playing a few 
weeks ago, but a) I'm level 12 b) haven't left the immediate areas 
surrounding freeport and c) have anything but "uber" stuff (check the 
magelo link in my sig). I promise you, if you took a true powergamer and 
let him play for 10 hours, versus me playing for 20 hours, the 
powergamer would leave me in the dust.
