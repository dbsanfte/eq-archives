A great way to get a wicked item for only 2-10 pp is to run the Library Book
quest for the Testament of Vanear that has stats +10 wis +10 mana and is used
in your secondary slot.  The mob you need to kill is llevel 16 so you might
want to get a partner to help or wait until 19 level spells.  Dont need to do
the erudin part of it unless your into serious roll playing.  Just give Moodoro
Finharn 2gp for the book you use to combine the two page parts.  Read about it
on allakhazam's way cool web page (make note of the level 40 smuggler you need
to time to avoid!!):
