    Not in my experience. When I did that camp for XP, I'd skip looting
anything but the money bugs, and I was one happy cleric. (Back then most
folks hadn't figured out the "always drops gem item" thing yet, the change
was new.)

    Yup, the named beetle in that camp drops it.

    Nope, but there's more than the wandering Krup in that camp. Clear all
the way down to the door of the Crypt, you'll see more. If they had a rogue
they could pull the undead frogs from just behind the door - those are
Krups, too, and I have seen a RBG drop from them.

    Yes, agreed. But those mobs are sitting within bowshot of you, and it's
not like anyone else is killing them.

    Nec Jail isn't what this type of farmer wants. He doesn't want to wait
for his items to sell to make money, he wants guaranteed income. Money bugs
are as guaranteed as anything in the game. I agree, though, especially
because the Iksar also frequently drop gems from the lesser gem table. When
we did that camp, I used to exclusively loot them, back when Iksar blood was
only good for Iksar cultural. I made quite the haul recently on selling
Tunics made with those old bloods.
