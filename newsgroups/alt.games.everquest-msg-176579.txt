Well yeah get at least one maxed, preferably the one you have the best
weapon for.

Maxing ALL weapon skills is actually one of the most overrated things
in EQ. If people would think about it, they would find it makes more
sense to max a weapon skill AFTER you get a decent weapon that uses
it, not before. If all you have are rusties in a category, don't
bother. You will actually annoy less people by doing it later.

The only exception would be to do your best to raise one of 2hs or 2hb
as you go, because they take longer to raise just in normal fighting
(because you're not dual wielding).

Raising the 1h weapon skill is EASY. You can go from zero to max in a
single session even at higher levels. So again, max the skills of the
weapons you use, and worry about the rest later.
