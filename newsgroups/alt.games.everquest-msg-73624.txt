This totally ignores the return on investment. If my character is
level 30ish, the amount of time it takes to *run* to a place where
people buy and sell isn't even worth what I'm going to get for an item
like that, not to mention the time required to actually sell them.

Personally, I don't enjoy buying and selling at all. Until the items
get into the kiloplat range, it's just not worth the time. Even when I
was on my first character, slaughtering dervs and there was a *market*
for derv rings, it wasn't worth the time.
