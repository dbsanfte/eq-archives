Tasselhoff Burrfoot (sp) was a halfling.

No they did NOT. Halflings (and the town of Rivervale) look and appear
as they do in Tolkeins world. Their interactions within the world of
Norrath (EQ), and the lore associated with the race in-game are
definately NOT based on Tolkein.

No, you are using an extreme and missing the point. The EQ Ranger is a
Warrior/Driud Hybrid. It is perfectly logical that any race that has
Warriors and Druids could develop the hybrid Ranger. Just because YOU
don't like the idea, doesn't refute the logic.

There is no "right" or "wrong". They write the code and develop the
game. They make the rules. Your bias against halfling Rangers is based
solely on YOUR opinion.

No they do NOT make as much sense, and again you are using extremes
that do not apply. Point of fact is that Verant could add the
combinations you mentioned in the next patch, and they could rewrite
the story line to include them.

And the Human monks DID complain. They were jealous  just like you
acting now.

Verants game, and Verants storyline. You can take it or leave it, but
it is not your place (or mine to judge it).

There were halflings. Just because they were not modelled on Tolkein
doens't invalidate thier existence.

It is pointless to contiue. You are biased by jealousy and race/stat
envy.
