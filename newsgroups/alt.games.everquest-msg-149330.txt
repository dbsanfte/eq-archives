Well, waddya know, I never actually tried this, Will have to test it
out, as it sounds great.

Yup. Still on easy camps I'd be more inclined to kill them faster than
wait for taunt to actually work. I've always got AEtaunt if someone's in
trouble, and dual hates mean they aren't hitting on the chanter for very
long. Still a nice trick I didn't know of before. WIll add it to the
arsenal. Thanks.

Our chanters swear by it in VT, though admittedly, they usually have
someone right a rightclick do it to save slots.

And if the monk's pulling, FDs, and is still in range of the song...?


> Its situational.

That was really the point I was trying to make. What may be classed as
'defining' bad play, could well be a valid tactic in some situations.
