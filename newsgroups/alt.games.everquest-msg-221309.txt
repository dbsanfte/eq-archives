You misunderstand.  Or I didn't make my point very clearly, or
something.  What I meant to get across was that having a higher HP
does matter, and the erosion of the Warrior HP advantage by gear
and buffs needs to be reversed.  Warriors should have enough more
HP than equivalently geared knights to make healing more efficient
and to make survival of damage spikes more likely.  HP is one of
the key advantages in the EQ combat/healing system, and Warrior HP
should be enough better to make a difference when a fight requires
multiple CHeals (not necessarily a CHeal chain), or when fighting
a mob that is unslowable or mitigates slow, or when fighting a mob
with such high resists that it often cannot be slowed quickly (and
that's a fight where a Warrior/knight working in tandem to keep the
mob off the slower would be cool, of course you'd probably need a
spare knight or two for when the Warrior fails to taunt the mob off
the knight...)  Anyhow, the idea is that superior ability to stand
and take it should be part of how Warriors counterbalance knight
advantages to be equally attractive to XP groups, as well as a big
part of what makes the Warior the ultimate raid tank.  Superior HP
is better than superior mitigation because HP also apply to spell
damage.

I like your idea of reducing the offensive penalty for /disc defensive.
the penalty's main function is to make the /disc useless for the
overwhelming majority of non-raid encounters (regardless of what they
intend the penalty to do that is its actual function in game).  And
reducing the penalty will have only a small effect on raids (the MT
will generate a bit more hate from weapon damage, procs won't change)
it would then give the Warrior a little something extra to offer an
XP group.  It could work well as part of the solution to the balance
problem.
