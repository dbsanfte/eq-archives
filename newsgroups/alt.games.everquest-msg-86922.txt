Yep, though it may not have alwasy been this way.

Everyone needs a key.

As far as I know you have to port, gate, or TL out.  Maybe there is a 
zone-out, but I haven't seen it yet.

I honestly don't remember, but if there are mobs here there are two of 
them, and they're light-blue to 59.  I *think* there are 8 mobs that spawn 
in the zone-in area, but they shouldn't be close enough to aggro.

Oh, and if you're on the Innoruuk server, Howling Stone is the worst zone 
in the game.  It's a deathtrap, developed by some evil Verant programmer 
who likes it when people lose their corpses.  If you're on any other 
server, Howling Stone is a great place, well worth the time and effort to 
get your team equipped with keys.
