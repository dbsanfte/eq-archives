My 61 enchanter recently dinged Dire Charm, and I've been getting
used to it.  I really enjoy the soloability it lends me, and I've
taken advantage of it to go to some out-of-the-way places like
Acrylia Caverns and Crypt of Nadox.  I've begun accumulating
some questions:

I tried to DC a particular mob a few times and got the result
message that it was resisted.  I didn't get the "mob too high"
message, just the resist message.  Can DC be resisted just like
any other spell?

In general, how does warrior-mob DPS compare to cleric-mob DPS?
If it's anywhere close, it seems like a cleric pet would be a
bargain, because they CH themselves.

If I DC an enchanter mob that itself has a pet, what happens
to the pet?  Does it aggro me?

Will a DC spellcaster pet ever cast beneficial spells on me?

Thanks.
