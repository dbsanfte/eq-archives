There's a huge difference between setting a timer on a dungeon so
people can't go afk for hours and what you descibe above. 

When people start talking about having to use tracking or Eye of Zomm
so they can scout a dungeon to finish it in time then we're in a whole
different ballpark. My faith in SOEs ability to get the balance right
for high and low DPS groups on something like that is zero. They've
failed miserably every time they tried it up to now, why should I
expect any better from this?  

Based on their track record, I'll go ahead and make a prediction now.
These dungeons will be extremely hard based on tight time limits when
LDoN first comes out. People will start gravitating towards the high
DPS classes just so they can finish them, much frustartion, wasted
time (which is, after all, what SOE wants with any given expansion)
and bitching from the players will result. Finally, 3 to 6 months down
the road, they'll relent and increase the timers on all the dungeons. 

So, until I see evidence to the contrary, I'll stick by my original
comments, leave it to SOE to fuck up what should have been a really
nice expansion for the casual gamer.
