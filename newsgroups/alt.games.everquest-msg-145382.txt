Lull is similar to Harmony in the same way that Chaotic Feedback
is similar to Manaburn.  :-p

For Lull line to be useful you need social mobs with low (very low)
MR, in a place where pathing is predictable and convenient (i.e. they
head straight for you), and that are not quite far enough apart to
avoid chaining without a little help.  I found exactly one place like
that:  FM Giant Fort.  There might be others, but if there are I'll
bet nobody knows about them because nobody uses the spells.  I've
heard of Paladins using Lull on mobs specificly to pull them, which
tells you just how valuable an agro reducer it is.

Kaev <--- who used Lull-line to single-pull hundreds of FM Giants,
and quit trying elsewhere when he tired of the trains.
