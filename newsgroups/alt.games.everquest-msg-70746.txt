I presume you meant "Wis" instead of "Mana" in the above
formula...


>With Wis greater than 200:
>Level*42+(Wis-200)*6-(Wis-200)/5

Wouldn't this be clearer as:

  Level*42 + (Wis-200)*5.8

Three things of interest:

   1.  The "Level*42" is the amount of mana earned
       by the first 200 points of WIS.  The (Wis-200)*5.8
       is the mana "bonus" for having WIS beyond 200.

   2.  The amount of mana earned by your WIS under 201
       depends on level -- the higher your level, the
       more mana each WIS point earns you.  However,
       the mana earned for each WIS point beyond 200
       is independent of level.  A level 1 Cleric
       gets as much extra mana for pushing his WIS
       from, say, 202 to 204 as does a level 60 Cleric.

   3.  The amount of mana that any level character
       gets for each WIS point over 200 is the same as
       the amount of mana that a level 29 character
       gets for each WIS point below 201.
