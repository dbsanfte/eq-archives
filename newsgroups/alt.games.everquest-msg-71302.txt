This caster yells YEE HAW!!! Now I'm not going to get poked for binds or
guilted into 'em. I've ALWAYS felt that mellees ought to have some way
of binding themselves. And I've only charged for 'em with my first
caster who had the ability and no money. Tiru has never charged for 'em.
Maybe I *will* play a hybrid more often.
