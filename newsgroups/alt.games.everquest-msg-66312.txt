All classes can solo effectively up to level 10 or so.

Pretty much to begin with all you can do is nuke when you can, melee when
you can't, and have your pet do as much damage as possible, hoping the
critter'll die before you.

I gotta tell ya though, enchanters are a grouping class.  Sure, you CAN solo
(primarily) to 51, but you'll be hated in groups because you won't know what
the heck you're actually there for.  If you want to solo because of limited
time, I'd recommend you check out magicians, necros and druids.
