    Only if you don't factor in danger. A lone wizard with KEI will still
get smeared if he lets the mobs he's quadding ever catch up to him, or if he
gets adds. With melees in the group, you have someone that can take a bit of
pounding after a taunt if the casters ever get in trouble. Lower XP (reward)
over time, but also lower risk of dying.

    Now, to be fair, many people take a more global look at the issue. They
look at total net XP per unit time, including deaths, because to them there
is no longer any real risk from death except lost XP and lost potential XP
doing the trivial CR. And that argument has a lot of validity, as the KEI'ed
person usually does come out ahead of the person that groups even including
CR times and cost of getting a new KEI/res. It could be that with
graveyards, open outdoor hunting grounds, and all the other factors in game
that future rewards will be determined on a time vs. reward basis. But from
a traditional risk/reward standpoint, there are clear tradeoffs in going
solo.

    Even those that don't start in a guild end usually end up in one. And
once you're there, you develop as fast if not faster than casters. Everyone
strongly believes "a melee is his gear", and loot rewards are usually judged
accordingly.

    Very bad analogy. As I point out above, high-end guilds live and die
based on their melees. Guilds aren't one warrior, ten clerics, twenty
wizards, and some support casters to make it all work. If anything, a better
analogy would be the Tortoise and the Hare. Melees are the tortoise: they
start slow, they level slow, but by the endgame most of them have a very
solid spot in the roster of a guild. Casters are the hares: they level fast,
but when they get close to the endgame they get shut out because a lot of
what casters bring to the table doesn't stack. Compare and contrast the two:

    Rangers, rogues, and monks all bring high DPS to the table - they stack.
Warriors don't stack as well, but solid redundancy is required for success
so they get picked up in high numbers. Bards have enough utility that
there's usually more than one or two that can be used on a raid, but not
much more than that. Paladins, SKs, and BSTs are mostly used for specific
roles (buffer or puller) in which having only one is OK - they stack poorly.
Paladins and SKs also suffer because one of their roles, offtank, can also
be handled by a warrior, and you need lots of them around anyways.

    Clerics stack well given that encounters are designed for multiple
healers. Wizards bring high DPS to the table, so they stack. ENCs and SHMs
are like bards in that they have enough roles that having more than one is
useful, but you don't need many more than that in the average situation. DRU
and NEC aren't really seen as high DPS or terribly good utility beyond a few
spells, so they get left out. They also suffer because as long as you have
lots of clerics, you don't really need DRUs or NECs. Mages used to also be
in this category, but with PoP advances they have a bit more DPS they can do
and are beginning to be seen as stackable.

    So, if you were planning for the endgame, what class would you be? WAR,
RNG, ROG, MNK all get guild invites. BRDs get in because there's so few of
them that make the endgame, and there is some demand. Same thing with BSTs,
likely because of how new the class is. PALs and SKs get shut out. Casters?
CLR, WIZ all get guild invites. MAGs are in the same position as bards, as
are ENCs. DRU, NEC, SHM all get left out. Guess which caster classes are the
most popular at lower levels? DRU, NEC, SHM. Doesn't sound so good for the
casters now, does it?

    Anyone, even a new player to the game, can get FBSS haste, 0.5-level
ratio weapons, and enough +HP/AC gear to survive fights starting at max
bandage point. Especially when you figure that many low-level mobs in places
like the old world were tuned against melees that would be using Fine Steel
weapons and Langseaxes.

    It's not as important to XP over time as health regen rate, except for
one thing: total HPs determines whether a melee can or can not solo, period.
It's like mana pool with casters, only the default mana pools casters get
are usually always sufficient to solo.

    My warrior would routinely bandage up to higher than 50%. It's quite
easy: bandage to 50%. I'll use my 47 WAR as an example. She has 2500 HPs
roughly, 500 of that from "direct" (+HP) gear. So at 50%, she's at 1250 of
2500. Now, remove all your +HP gear that doesn't also have +STA on it. That
accounts for roughly 350 of her 500 direct HPs from gear. Items like fire
opal rings and black sapphire earrings usually lead to the bulk of a melee's
+HPs coming from non-STA gear. So now she's at 900 of 2150 HPs after
stripping down. Bandage to 50% again - 1075 of 2150. Now put the +HP gear
back on - 1425 of 2500 HPs, or 57%. You can also take off STA-enhancing
gear, but you don't regain HPs from STA when you put the gear back on so you
need to figure out if you gain or lose by doing this.
