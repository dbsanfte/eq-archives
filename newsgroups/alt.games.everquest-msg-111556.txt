Average with FRAPS 30-50 with all models on in low-poly zones (eq
old-world, Kunark, Velious).

With all models on I get about 8fps at that location. The bazaar is
the WORST zone by far for me if I have all Luclin models enabled. If I
turn most off it runs run (20-30fps and smooth).

Definately not "a lot" better. I don't think the problem is the
cards/drivers. The graphics engine in EQ is bloated and demands more
memory and bandwidth than any other game in high-poly zones like the
bazaar.

This will happen with the 8500 as well if there is a lot of people in
a single spot. For example if I run up to the tunnel in EC my FPS will
drop to single digits for about 5-10secs. Then come back up to normal
levels. My HDD doesn't thrash so it is not due to new textures
loading. My guess is that the part of the graphics engine that
retrieves textures from memory is not efficient or is horribly
over-taxed.

If you were using an older set of drivers, then it is possible that
the 8500 performed worse. I am 100% sure that an 8500 with the latest
drivers would outperform your GF2MX in EQ, but NOT by very much. The
problem isn't the card, the problem is EQ.
