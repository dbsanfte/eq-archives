lol, I was so complaining about that same thing when I got in the game. I 
*wanted* it to all go to another window, that's how I had it with the new 
UI (I never used anything special in the old UI). I was saying that I'd 
wished they could have made it so I could click 'Melee' to make everything 
in that submenu go to the window rather than clicking one by one.
