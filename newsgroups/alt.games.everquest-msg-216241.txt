Two things I think you've missed.

1)  Healing must equal the damage taken by the tank.  Drastic increase in
DPS reduces the amount of damage taken by the tank, allowing a wider
selection of healing choices.  Thus, rogues do not come out so short; the
DPS a rogue adds gives you additional flexibility in your other options.
Witness my last LDON group:  Rogue, Rogue, Paladin, Shaman, Druid, Bard, all
levels 52 to 56.  Healing was not an issue (even though the paladin was only
52) because the mobs died so fast to the rogues.

2)  You left out da bards, save for an honorable mention in CC.  (Guess what
class I was playing in the above group. /grin  )  You mention that LDON is
the expansion for the generalists, and left out the greatest generalist of
them all.  Pacify, group haste saving the shaman mana, damage shields,
pulling with a 30% slow to take the edge off until shaman slow hit, cure
disease/poison, manasong, mezz, charm, tracking - bards give you the
flexibility to do so MUCH.
