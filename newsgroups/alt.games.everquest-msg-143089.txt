And some people don't.

The E'ci public raiding channel is a very active one, with people constantly
joining it and leaving it, checking in and seeing if a raid is in progress,
etc...  and the one time I left /announce on before joining the bazaar
channel, I nearly went LD from the "Player_01 joins the channel.  Player_02
leaves the channel." spam.

Also, some people play with 5 or 6 (or more) chat channels running....
