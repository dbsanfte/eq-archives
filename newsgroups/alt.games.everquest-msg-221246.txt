While you were busy doing that, my druid would have already ported.

Actually no one requires help from a necro that much, especially one
they can't understand. No one has any reason to speak iksar. You
mention roleplaying, but roleplaying is playing a role that exists. In
the world of norrath there is no point in learning other languages,
they are not needed in any quests or anything throughout the world and
everyone on a regular server starts knowing common. 

So really it is they who are roleplaying correctly and you who are
breaking tradition.

The roleplaying should have an in game point, which makes sense in the
world of norrath that we PLAY IN as opposed to some idealized world of
Norrath which they have never made.
