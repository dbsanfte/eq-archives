One thing to watch out for: downtime.  EQ has *way* more downtime than DAoC,
or pretty much any other game that came out since EQ.  The downtime in EQ
isn't *too* bad, *if* that's all you've ever known.  However, once you play
any later game, you'll find yourself wondering why you are sitting on your
ass so much in EQ.

I can only play EQ now when I have something I want to watch on TV, or a
book I'm trying to read, so that I can have something to do during the 10
minutes of medding after a fight.  I have an UltimateTV, which helps quite a
bit here, since I can watch TV while medding, then pause the TV, kill a mob,
sit down to med, and resume the TV show. :-)
