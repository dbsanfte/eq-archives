Have you typed "UseUmbra=FALSE" in your eqclient.ini file, under the
subcatagory [Defaults] ?  Everything for me was ultra choppy until I did
that.  Now the choppiness is more of an occasional occurrance, rather than
the norm.

This isn't a total cure-all, as the other night in Oasis, all of a sudden,
everything got really choppy again for no apparent reason, and stayed that
way the rest of the night.  But places like Freeport are now practical to
visit again (it was a pain spending half an evening's gaming session just to
get to a bank due to the ultra-extra amount of time it would take to slog
and wade through city zones.)

Less populated servers might be of some help.  If you have Luclin installed,
the new character models do take up more memory, thus areas with more folk
can be more choppy.
