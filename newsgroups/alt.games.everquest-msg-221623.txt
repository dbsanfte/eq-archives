Yes and no. If the DPS is high enough, the damage taken is lessened by
the sheer speed of kills; this can be a plus. However, and you really
need to understand this, in situations where you are fighting
hard-hitting, long-lasting mobs, beastlords will not be able to cut it
without a very very good cleric. BLs don't, compared to tanks of equal
experience, have many HP; about half what a warrior has. Our AC isn't
great because we are a leather class, and our damage mitigation isn't
stellar. Most beastlords learn early on that they are, at best, paper
tanks, and laeve the real mobs to the real tanks. In 'speed kill'
situations, however, we are more than adequet. We have very nice DPS,
especially if you count the pet, and enough HP to handle a few blows. I
still think that in LDON, a group of 3 beastlords, two necros, and a
chanter would be the absolute best out there. Hell, drop the chanter,
add another DPS class of any variety, and you would likely STILL be
fine.

In the right situations, I will tank. However, don't expect me to tank
in, say, PoV, or BoT. There, I am a short stopgap till a chanter or real
tank can peel it off me; a BL dying is better than a chanter or cleric
dying, IMHO. Yes, I die a lot, but better me than the cleric!
