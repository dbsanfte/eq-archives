Strangely, the Stien is now up over 250pp on the MT server.  In fact a
study of the history of Stein prices is one of the more interesting
reflections of economics in the game.  Early on, it was difficult to get
and prices were high.  Then people worked out how to do it relatively
easily, and farmed the heck out of it since it was a way of making tons of
money with little effort.  Prices dropped and dropped, until it wasn't
worth the effort involved.  For a while prices remained down there because
the things were still plentiful.  But now, they are so little farmed that
they've become rare again, and a new generation is discovering that they
too can make a killing with relatively little effort... the addition of the
POK portal system, in particular, is a massive time saver.  The needle will
doubtless swing back again, though, since that new generation will also run
supply up well past demand, while demand will drop off as the new
generation of customers all get their own stiens and don't need a second.
