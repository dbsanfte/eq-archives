We killed trak a long long time ago (when killing Vindi was a big thing for
us) with <18 people, no shaman for buffs, no necro (no casualties either!)

3 groups isnt difficult to find.  When it was a guild priority, you could
expect 20-30 people there every pop ready for it (not just my guild but
others)

Also remember it needs a melee force to fight through the juggs to get into
Traks lair
