Bards have a similar effect in a song... affects the bard and everyone
in his group in range by randomly short range porting them in a random
but never uphill direction.

I used it to go from Aviak Penthouse to the ground a lot when I
was young, and later to get from top to bottom of CC without having
to run the tunnels invis or fly down past all those mobs... I'd start the
song, jump into the air, and appear on the bottom almost without
fail (occaisionally I'd appear on a lower level ramp instead of all the
way down.)

Its also fun in certain zones as a massive run speed boost, twist
selos with this song while running down slope, and every tic
you get thrown ahead a few hundred yards.  If you thought
bards were fast on selos, you should try racing one using this
added advantage!
