I'm guessing you mean "within" here, please correct me if I am wrong.

EQ roughly<real roughly> uses the same old advancement and skill system as
D&D or AD&D.

As such, there is no comparison<for example> between a level 14 druid with
SoW, Stinging Swarm, etcetera, and a level 10 druid. There is no comparison
between a magician with a level 4 pet and a magician with a level 8 pet or 8
and 12 respectively.

The problem is a lot of shall we say, "uninformed", people tend to say
people such as myself who have been playing D&D type games for over a
quarter of a century now don't know what we are missing.

Simple fact is *everyone* knows exactly what they are missing. That is,
someone with a level 14 druid<for instance> trying to kill our level 10
*anything* because it is not about a PvP encounter so much as exploiting an
imbalance in the a system designed for team play vs PK.

It isn't a game when the outcome is preordained. Make it a game by having a
50:50 chance of the outcome *not* being preordained and I would bet 1/2 of
the buttmonkies on what passes for PvP servers would quit. The reason most
of them are there is *EXACTLY* the reason why everyone else isn't.

If you find it exciting to fight a twinked character 4 levels above your non
twinked character, all I can say is I will volunteer to kill you on E'ci
whenever you want some excitment. Just dust off any character you have 4
levels below one of mine and we can go at it. That way, neither of us will
miss the excitement.
