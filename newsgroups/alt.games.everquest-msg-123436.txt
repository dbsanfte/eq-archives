Ahh, the old Fishing Pole of Confusion... a favourite weapon of many
Newbies... including myself on more than a couple of occaisions :o)~~~

I can't beat Jazz's example in one shot... have to switch to Dual Wield...

My first ever char... Human Ranger in Surefall... fell into the moat and
drowned.

After deleting that one, and playing the tutorial and Reading The F***ing
Manual... I tried a Human Warrior in Freeport...
He actually lived long enough to get out of the newbie garden... but stalled
trying to go from EC to NRo. Why? Because Shady Swashbuckler /conned red to
him and I didn't fancy my chances of a CR in a pitch black tunnel :o)
