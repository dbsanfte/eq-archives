Another neat trick- you can use perl style regular expressions (regular 
expressions are basically text patterns- and perl is king of regexps) in 
your score file. You can use them in any header that is downloaded *before* 
messages are (IE when you get new headers, not when you click on a header).

For example,


    Score:: 600
        Subject: empty

automatically adds 600 to the score of anything with my name in the 
subject.

    Score:: 1000
        From: lawson

will add 1000 to Monuals posts.

If Monual posts something with my name in the subject, I will get a post 
with a score of 1600.

Spam filters:

    Score:: =-9999
~Subject= .*[a-z]

This overrides the score and sets it to -9999 (meaing I will not see it) if 
the subject line does not contain at least one lowercase letter.

    Score:: =-9999
	Subject:[Vv][Ii][Aa][Gg][Rr][Aa]|\w\W\w\W\w\W\w\W\w|\w\W\W\w\W\W\w\W\W
\w\W\W\w

This kills ViAgRA, V-i,A.g.r-A, V I A G R A and V..I..A..G..R..A

\w is a word character (IE a letter), \W is a non-word letter (space, 
comma, etc)

    Score:: =-9999
         XRef: alt\.binaries\.pictures\.erotica\.gwar

I don't want things crossposted to that newsgroup (and dear god, who 
*would*?). Note the \ in front of . - this is because in perl regexps . 
matches any single character.

Hope that helps!
