I've been there. I never said all melees are assumed to be loot whores. I 
merely described a situation that happens all to frequently, regardless 
of how personalities are "dealt with". If you have to spend much time 
meddding, chances aren't real great that the loot will just be left there 
for you. Master looting rarely works, because people don't leave at the 
same time that often, and the ML is unable to give you anything more than 
an approximate split of the looted cash on hand - no proceeds from the 
sale of items.

That's my point. Most would be willing to pay in PoK, so why not be 
willing to pay your group cleric for it as well? Sorry, I was referring 
to the tangent on clerics being expected to foot the bill for group 
Temps.
