Cleric and Enchanter.

This duo is nearly unstoppable at higher levels.

The Enchanter Charms, buffs the pet (Dire Charm works best, of course), and
debuffs the target, while the Cleric buffs and CHes the pet.

I've seen this duo take out level 62 mobs with absolutely no difficulty. The
only downside to the duo is the time that it takes to kill some upper level
mobs, so it's not the best for exp, but superior to all others in terms of
stability.
