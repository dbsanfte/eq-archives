     As A player on the evil side let me tell first the belts are a DEATH TRAP
give them in WFP and NFP (bank) guards will hate you more.  give them to Paly in
NFP and the guards in W and E free Port will Hate you more.
     What I am going to tell you the path I used to let Lenny Oger so he can go
to the bank in NFP, High Hold, Tree elf city, High Elf City and allmost Dwarf
also the guards will not attack me in Halflign city By lvl 25

     First you will need the help of someone (LOTS of it) E&W FP

       Start in EFP tunnal UNDER EFP Rouge Guild
       GO to   Harkin Duskfoot, and telll him "What Message" you get a note for
Janam
       Then go to Nestral T`Gaza tell her "who is Rebby" and get a note from her
for Rebby
       Take both notes to Janam and Rebby both stand across from the "Theater of
the Tranquil"
       Return stuff you get and repeat repeat repeat
       raise faction with the Freeport Militia and Corrupt Qeynos Guards allso
freeport Merchants 2 times as fast
      NO NEG FACTION FROM THIS a win win sell easyer no guards killing you and
no one hates you more

      NOTE: If you are KOS to the Guards have a frend take the notes to WFP for
you give you the return note and you turn
      them in it i gave up 3 hours for my oger who the Merchants are WARM to and
the Guards are Dub.

      North Free Port
      After the Rebby/Janam you are no longer KOS to Guards in North RO East or
West Comm go and Kill Orcs (Sell the belts to the ones that do not know better
and make some Plat) the camp in West Comm is allmost allways NOT CAMPED allso
the new camps in Nektulos Forest is allmost not know so allmost never camped.
about 5 or 6 hours killing orcs got Lenny Oger into NFP By lvl 17 Full run of
NW&E Free Port.

   High Hold Pass First Kill Raiders In North or South Karana kill all them sell
the bronze stuff for 5 or 6 hours you will make about 160 plat from the bronze
and Guards in High Hold will let you pass. (based on My Oger) the bard in High
Keep will not let you to bank so part 2 is go to Ocean of Tears loc -1000 -7000
kill Gargoyles when you get a stack of Eyes go con a Bard should be Dub. now you
can go into the bank in High Keep. (allso the eye stack will sells for 2 or 4
each so sell a stack for a big price tag

   Go to Ocean of Tears Loc 500 9000 right out of Butcherblock Mountains kill
"Agua Goblins" this is good with Gnome Guards, Wood Elf Guards, High Elf Guards
and Dwarfs so if ya see Oger in the tree elf city that would be Lenny the Oger.
that would be me.
