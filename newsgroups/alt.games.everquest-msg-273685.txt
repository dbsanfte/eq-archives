I was going to do a point-by-point commentary on your post, but it ended up
seeming a little antagonistic which wasn't my intention. So I'm just going to
add one comment. =)

I feel that you are selling WoW somewhat short in many respects, especially
the 'feel' of the game world. The WoW lore is just as rich to a longtime fan
of the Warcraft series as EQ2 is to an EQ fan (in fact, I'd bet that if you
asked someone who's never played EQ but has played WC/2/3 - they'd say that
EQ2 has shallow, generic lore compared to the rich, deep lore of Azeroth. =p).

I also think that Vanguard (when released) is going to hit EQ2 a lot harder
than WoW, as they're both aimed at a similar market (the 'Must have a
group/grind/endure timesinks' crowd) whereas WoW is aimed more at the
'generic' gamer market. Mind you, Guild Wars is probably going to 'steal' more
customers/potential customers from WoW more than EQ2, so it all balances out.
