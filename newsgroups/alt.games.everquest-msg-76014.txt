   I think there will always be people who have
the begging mentality, and not just in Oasis.
   Here's my latest rude beggar story.  Tealeef,
my shaman, level 23 at the time, and just zoned
across the bridge from S.Karana.  A paladin,
didn't check his level but he was either red or
yellow to me, immediately positions himself in 
front of me.  I know what this usually signifies,
and toss SoW on him.  He says "Thanx.  Heal me,
plz."  I look at his health for the first time 
and see that he's at about a third.
   This pissed me off.  Sow is a pretty cheap
spell, and its not one that non-SoWers can get
for themselves without significant cost or effort,
and is very useful.  I don't mind SoWing people,
under most circumstances.  But healing?  That
takes a _big_ chunk of mana, in this case, 
considering our levels difference, perhaps all
of my mana.  This guy was in no danger of dying,
he just wanted to cut down on his down time at 
the expense of mine.  I do believe that shaman
are better healers than paladins, but this guy
_did_ have the ability to heal himself.
   I said "Sorry, OOM", which wasn't true.  I sit
down for a bit, as does he.  After a minute, he
stands up and starts healing himself.  Then he
runs away, with the SoW that given him before 
he asked for anything at all.
   I bet he spent a fair amount of time in Oasis,
begging for heals and buff at the docks.  
Anything to help him level faster.  After all,
he is the only important person in the game,
right?
