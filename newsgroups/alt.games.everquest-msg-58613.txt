Greetings all,

I'm playing a L16 scout of Tunare (wood elf rogue in other words)
and as such consider myself a force for `goodness and niceness'
in the world of Norrath. I'd probably be playing a paladin,
since I have a real problem doing `evil' acts in game, except that
18 levels and a lot of reading convinced me the class has some
problems.

As a newbie i'm always keeping my eyes open for other hunting
grounds that would be fun to visit. But very few sites or guides
mention the nature of the foe.

For example at the moment i'm in highpass slaughtering orcs
and gnolls. No problem there, members of an evil culture,
highly aggro, and extremely unlikely to change their position.
On top of which they're attacking the citizens and guards of
highpass so I get to be a heroic defender while stabbing them
in the back and going through their pockets.

So the question is which groups you could justify not hunting.
Largely stemming from some mention i've heard about the
aviak's and froglok's (apart from them being good xp). With
the basis being the following.

1) The race is intelligent, in it's home environment, and will
not hostile on the `good' races in the game. Or if the hostile
reaction can be reduced/removed without having to do `evil'
acts.

2) The culture of the race is not bound to an evil god or
some `evil' purpose. 

It's all morally relative, mostly role playing, and open to
negotiation if they're the sole owners of astounding loot :)
On the other hand it might be cool to be one of the few
adventurers who's not got an entire race seething with hatred
at them.

This partly started with the fairies in Feydark. Not only are
they cute, but if I don't kill them they won't kill me. I can
live with that. There's enough hostile stuff in each zone that
I can't see it being too much of a limitation.
