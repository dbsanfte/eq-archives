*grin*
Last time I used harmony was when my DL group had decided to take a
stroll to the giant fort in burning woods. One blue and one flaming
red giant were up, they wanted me to harmony so we could get the blue.
Now, if I don't get close enough to see the spell effect, I don't know
whether or not the spell landed. I harmony the blue giant, go to
harmony the red, can't see if the spell landed, step a little closer,
cast, and promptly get a very angry giant on my tail :)
I learned at a young age (WC derv camps) that harmony and a large
pre-harmony aggro range are a nasty combination, especially when I try
to cast on red mobs. As it was, we almost died, but the forest giant
ancient died instead :)
