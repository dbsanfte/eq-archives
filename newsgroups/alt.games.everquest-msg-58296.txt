OK, I tried playing around with root/DOT some more now that I
have two, and it still doesn't look good.

Normal kill practice: Snare, back up, Combust, back up, Combust...
repeat
till dead.

Root DOT:  Snare, pull up to safe area, root, put both DOTs on,
sit and wait till something wears off, reapply as needed until dead.

OK, so Combust does 171 points for 110 mana, and CreepingCrud
does 183 points for 100 mana.  But it takes only what, six seconds
per 171 points instead of 60!

Further, Ensnaring Roots is only marginally more reliable than the
useless Grasping Roots spell, I'm still lucky to get both Crud
and Immolate on before the mob is moving again.  Even
if the root works perfectly, you have to look at root damage
plus DOT damage compared to root mana plus DOT mana
cost to see the real damage to mana ratio...

If the mob is moving, then Crud does less damage per mana
than Combust does... and since I find root honored more
in the breach than in practice, the mob spends -most- of
its time moving in on me.

I was putting a DOT on at the end of a fight, once the mob
starts running.. But looking at the mana cost difference
between Crud and Immolate, (10 points) versus the time
it takes for the mob to drop (instant, versus up to a minute)
it strikes me I'm better off just killing it now.  No Frenzy based
adds, no snare breaking,

Immolate is much better on mana efficiency... except that it
mostly won't stick to mobs, which chews up efficiency fast;
assuming I get 50% stick (and I don't) thats a real cost of
240 mana for 240 damage, which again is worse than
immolate (where I do get some partial sticks, but still see
an average of 150 points per 110 mana, on red to me mobs)

I read where the problem with Immolate is that mobs get two
checks, one against Fire for the damage, and another against
magic for the AC debuff, and if either succedes you get no
stick.

Assuming an equal stick rate (which as I say, isn't the case
as I observe it) but root not working, now you get 180 damage
for your 120 mana, which again looks a lot like the 171 damage
for 110 mana off of combust... only it takes 60 seconds to
deliver instead of 6.

In a group I might be more interested in Immolate for its AC
debuff component, and the fact that its a big enough taunt
to keep the mob chasing me while my friends beat it to death...
but the damage component just doesn't seem worth the
effort.

Maybe this gets better at Drones of Doom?
