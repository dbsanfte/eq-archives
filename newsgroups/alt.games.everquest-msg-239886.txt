Actually, with what others are sort of saying, unless you're up there
at like level 56+ you may have a hard time finding groups in the old
zones.  I've spent a long time on my main ranger and then decided I
wanted to play some rogue twink, which was level 35ish.  Couldn't
really find any groups, but those that I did find were all crawling
around LDON zones.  So the majority of the time spent on my rogue was
power levelling myself with my enchanter.

If you do reopen your account, I do hope you have good luck and are on
the right server. =)
