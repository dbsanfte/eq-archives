I don't even think SOE checks most guilds most of the time.  On the Drinal
server, there are a plethora of worthless 3-4 member guilds that have open
recruitment and don't do anything but /ooc for open invites and Bazaar
traders.  (By worthless, I never see more than 1-5 membrs on at any given
time, and they're all in different zones with a large level range.)
