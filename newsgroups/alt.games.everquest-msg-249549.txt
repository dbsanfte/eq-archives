Well, you get full xp for killing them hte second time, so it seems 
reasonable for them to come back as tough as they were the first time.

The Freak Lt.s and Bosses that seem to have about a 25% chance to 
revive will hop up with 100% health and endurance, so you definitely
want to wait for their corpses to vanish before moving on, otherwise
you may have one at your back.

The other day we completed a mission and all but two of us had clicked
out of the mission (when you meet the mission objectives you can choose
to be teleported out to the mission entrance so you never have to hike
out of the "dungeon", though you can also stay and do clean-up if for
example killing all the mobs was not one of the objectives).  Anyway,
the tank and I are about to leave when the boss revives himself and
starts whacking on us.  We managed to take him down again for another
nice chunk of xp.  So just because the mission ended doesn't mean you
can turn your back on them.
