63/64 spells drop outside of HoH.  Make the effort to get in HOH and you
could enjoy greater drop rates.

Im sorry.. but im really failing to see your PoV here.

Sleepers Tomb dropped end-game weapons for probably 2 whole expansions
(maybe even 3)  You got these weapons with 1 group.

NOWHERE could you get a better weapon with 1 group than ST.   Thats because
ST loot was your "reward" for killing the first broods and getting keyed.

Oh ok, im sorry you thought I meant i solod it.  Yes your right, my guild
killed it, with me present and helping.
And what did I suggest to you?  Get YOUR guild to go kill the dragon too if
you want in.  I dont fool myself into anything.

And like already pointed out, theres a "solo quest" means of entering HoH
too if your guild is too small to kill the dragon.   Or you could ally with
other guilds.. whatever really.

You don't just demand and expect access to higher tier planes though, and
certainly not if your not in one of your servers leading guilds.

I never said Im an exceptional player.  No I dont think my guild tag makes
me "better" than you.

Am I entitled to more than you because of my guild tag?  Well from the
sounds of it your guild isnt making the necessary effort into advancing in
PoP, so yes, I think I am entitled to something your not because we put the
required effort in, complete the various timesinks and so on.

Or maybe they are putting in effort in PoP now, but they didnt put effort in
for the last 3+ years.  I've no doubt loot from AoW, Cursed/Emp/VT, nToV etc
helps a lot when it comes to passing trials and advancing in PoP

The reason i got my primal a year+ ago (and a lot of my guild) was because
we made a collective effort to kill all/as many FB dragons, and then to wake
up and be raiding ST EVERY 2 days at 7am EST.

The reason we and others can get vexthal loot is because we completed the
horrid timesinks required (emp ring = timesink, melee banes = timesink, vt
shard farming = timesink)

> VP was end game for Kunark.  HoH is not.  Slight difference there, champ.

And im sure there will be other zones that make HoH look like a gimped zone.
Whats your point?

> Yes because only people whose guilds can kill AD are putting effort into
EQ.

Which other tier trials have you attempted after passing PoJ trials?
Killing A'D isnt the only route to the next tier, but he is 1 route.

Oh I agree with the skill thing, top guilds don't have across-the-board uber
skilled players (they do generally have a significant number though).

What it does mean though is collectively they put a LOT more effort in than
the average guild

And dont delude yourself that everybody in a "top" guild is just an average
player that gets things they don't deserve, or didnt put the time/effort in
to get where they are today.
