How can you possibly make that logical leap?  You have basically said
that all religion is basically the same, and even an avowed agnostic
as myself can't agree with that.  
I agree that religion has had at least a hand in the majority of
conflicts in human history, but that doesn't negate the fact that
religion has also been used as an instrument to improve the human
condition more than any other single influence.  I think you're
placing yourself in an unwinnable situation, basically arguing that
people who are religious are illogical, and Sanjian has exhibited
nothing but logic and restraint.
You expect people to respect your right to not be religious, but I'm
not seeing you offer that same respect to those who do believe.  Sure
there are some things with the Morman faith I have serious issues with
(grew up in areas that were 30-85% Morman), but the good their
communities do is irrefutable.  
Until you're willing to accept the scorn and disdain done by any and
every non-religious person in the world, you really can't tar all
believers with the same brush.
