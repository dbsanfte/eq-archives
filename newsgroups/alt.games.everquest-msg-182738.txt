If the fighting is going so well that the cleric barely needs to heal,
then the HP buffs aren't needed. Period. It's not that the tank needs
it, it's that the tank is obsessed with the idea that he should never
be without it, period. This is a common mentality among tanks that
don't really know their abilities well - if they're fighting, they
think they need HP buffs, even if it's glaringly obvious that they'd
be in no danger without them. Plus the fact that the Talisman buffs
cost the clerics money. I'm sure that if the tank had provided the
component, then he would have gotten the buff whether he needed it or
not. Asking a cleric to waste a component on an unneeded buff, that's
what's wrong. Not lying about not having the component to cast it.
Waste your own fucking money on unecissary buffs, not the cleric's.
