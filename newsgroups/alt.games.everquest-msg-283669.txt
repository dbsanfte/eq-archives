It's a great idea, the problem of course is it defeats the exact purpose 
for which the stones were introduced, which means you have to question 
why the stones were added and if the game overall is better or worse for it.

When the stones were added, in PoP, the game was already top-heavy, 
people who wanted to get from A to B could, unless you were a lowbie, in 
which case you couldn't 'quickly' start achieving things in a group any 
more, because there weren't any groups in your home city or your 
starting newbie area to play with.  Sure, there were some lowbie 
characters lfg, but they were spread out all over the place.

Player density at the low levels meant you couldn't form groups.  In a 
grouping game, it was driving people nuts.  The books were a direct 
response to that issue.  Allow low level characters to get from their 
starting city, to any other starting city and hence, group together with 
other low level characters quickly, efficiently and start having fun.

They didn't abandon the idea of getting keyed to use ports, look at LDoN 
Magus travel as an example.  That was after PoP.  But since the starting 
level for LDoN wasn't 1, they felt it was ok to encourage people to have 
to get 'keyed' to actually use the portals.

I enjoyed getting it on my first two toons who did it, but after that it 
was merely another chore that got in the way of having fun.

If you only ever played one character, ever, then getting keyed for 
stuff would be fine, because you'd only ever do it once.  And it assumes 
there are other people at your level who also need the key and can do it 
with you or who you can group with, without getting the key if 
necessary.  Neither of those conditions is true enough any longer.
