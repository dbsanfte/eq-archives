LOL, not I. I'm looking for a replacement for EQLive, failing that 
then I'll retire from online gaming. I have no interest at all in Doom 
3. The fact that I found CoH mindless and boring is simply my personal 
opinion and should not be taken as what I think of people who enjoy 
it. The game was quite obviously not for me from the start. Others 
enjoy it immensely, and I'm quite happy for them. The more people who 
enjoy various games makes the whole community strong through fostering 
competition among game designers and we all win in the end when we 
find a game that catches our interest.
