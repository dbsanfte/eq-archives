I mostly play a 65 necro with 91 AA. After putting the usual in Runspeed and
regen, I did Pet discipline. Pet hold command is invaluable not just on
raids (I've blown my share because pet aggro'd), but solo'ing too. Example:
If I'm running around say Veksar looking for a pull, I don't want to get hit
and have to worry about the pet sprinting off to find me and get stuck in
some funny pathing, etc. I can run the mob back and sic the pet on it on my
turf :) Got First title. Then, I put AA's into Casting fury to be able to
land Critiacal blasts with nukes a couple in mental clarity (basically
flowing thought 1) and natural durability for STA based Hp increase and .
Got Second title.  Then I did newer AA, Planar, GoD and forgot about getting
third title. Not really worth it for a necro. I got Wake the dead 1,
Critical affliction 1 (DoT's get a chance to crit), Pet crit 3, Casting fury
3, Pet Flurry 1, Theft of Life 2 (ex heals), runspeed 4 (nice), Pet Feign
death 3 (really nice),  Swarm of death 1 (total waste, imo) and most useful,
Suspend pet 2. With Suspend Pet 2, you can not only keep your pet if you
need to go invis, but you can have a fully buffed (buffs and items) second
pet "waiting in the wings". A 65 mage guildmate has only really mentioned
Casting fury for the nukes, Pet Crit's and suspend minion AA's as ones he's
happy to have, but I'm sure there are some we haven't compared notes on.

Anyway, a bit lengthy, but I hope a little useful. GL!
