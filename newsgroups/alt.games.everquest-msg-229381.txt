I think you misunderstand whats being said here.

If the caster steals your money and doesn't buff you, then you are 
likely to kick up a fuss, using shout/ooc rant boards, guild chat, and 
so forth, to the extent that the caster becomes unable to make an income 
casting buffs (or failing to do so, in this case)

All that in exchange for saving a minute or less worth of medding, and 
for getting over on you to the tune of what, 25pp more or less?

Now I'm not as sure as all that that its quite that easy to ruin a 
caster's business.  And I think the obverse is -also- true, that should 
a caster buff you and you then don't pay him, that he can equally use 
the same sort of chat channels (plus maybe a local enchanter's channel 
or something) to tarnish your rep so you won't be able to get buffs in 
the future from anyone.  And what did you get, a two or three hour buff, 
tops, assuming you don't die, saving an average of 25pp or so?

Its in everyone's best interest that these transactions go thru, both 
have something substantial to lose (future business, future buffs) and 
very little to gain (a free buff, a little mana, 25pp or so both ways)

Splendid
