Assuming your DSL modem doesn't do NAT, you will want something to create 
an internal network for your 3 machines, or purchase 2 more IPs from 
Bellsouth.

You have at least one option that doesn't make you buy more IPs with the 
hardware you have now:

Dsl Modem <----> XP machine <----> Hub <----> Other 2 machines

For this setup, your XP Machine will need another NIC ( Network card ) and 
you'll need to set up masquerading of some sort ( MSoft ICS [ Does XP Home 
do this? ], WinGate, etc ).

If you buy a router, then it will be like this:

Dsl Modem <----> Router <----> 3 machines

LinkSys 8-port routers are at $100.00, now.  LinkSys and NetGear are the 2 
names you typically hear when talking about home-use DSL/Cable routers.  I 
personally own 2 LinkSys routers, but if all you want is for it to work, I 
would recommend a NetGear.  People can argue all day about which brand is 
better, but it's hard to argue the point that LinkSys owners have a higher 
percentage of problems with EQ than NetGear owners.  Both are easy to set 
up ( ever for the technically challenged ) so I'd go with the one that is 
proven to have fewer problems with EQ.

If you care about the in-depth features of the routers, then you need to 
research it further, but I'm guessing you just want it to work and not have 
to hassle with it.
