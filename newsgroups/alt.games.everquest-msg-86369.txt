Two Handers seem to proc more often than 1hders and I'd agree with Jeremiah,
slower the weapon the easier it seems to proc.
I've had upto ten procs off of Felhammer, 46 delay, in a fight (and of
course have had fights with none at all) but with Zealots Incarnadine, 35
delay, the best I have had so far is about 5.
When I was dual Wielding Yaks the best I could hope for was around 6.
