Again though, that is an issue with not breaking mez properly, not an issue
with the equipment per se.  Sure, uber equipment could make it so he can
save from an improper break, but, that is not the initial problem.  In a
case where this is occuring, I would recommend one of two courses of action,
boot the warrior, or root the mezzed mob.

The Rogue/Ranger/Monk all have options for reducing their aggro
significantly, and should be using them.  You are right that a warrior will
have a tough time stealing aggro from them, if they are bound and determined
to hold aggro.
