Your chance to proc ON A SPECIFIC SWING would be higher.

It's the same principle as if you had one green jellybean and some
number of red jellybeans, the odds of you picking out the green
jellybean by blindly putting your hand in the jar are higher the fewer
red jellybeans that are in the jar. But that doesn't mean there are
*more* green jellybeans!

See you are right. But no one has said you proc more per minute, only
that the odds of proccing on a specific swing increase.
