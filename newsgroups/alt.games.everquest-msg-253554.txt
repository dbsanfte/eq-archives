Did I mention 215kmiles on $1500 in repairs?  Hard to beat that level of 
reliability.  Thus, hard to talk me out of Fords without massive 
contrary evidence.  Looking on the web for similar pickups, I didn't 
find anything approaching the $15k I spent, either.  Actually that was 
$15382, which was $317 more than I paid for my last F150 9 years ago.

Arguing truck model, though, is like arguing religion, you never know 
who you're going to offend (perhaps the parrots don't talk about trucks 
either).  I wasn't trying to get into that tangent, but rather simply 
observing that at a time when you'd think people would be looking for 
more fuel efficient options, Ford seems to be doing away with the most 
efficient thing they make in my category.

Funny old world.
