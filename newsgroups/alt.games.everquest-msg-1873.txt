I have seen some whacky things happen with foraged food on low-level
characters.  I think it is some interaction with the code that gives
you free starter food at levels 1-3 when you die.  In any case, I have
seen foraged food disappear when a low-level character died.  It
should quit doing that at level 4 I bet.
