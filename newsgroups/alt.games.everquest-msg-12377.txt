Yeah i remember my first night of EQ...started a Dark Elf SK...after wondering
around the town for close to 3 hours trying to find something to kill..and
going to NPCs and thinking they were players...a nice guy says "This your first
chracter?"..and suggested i try a human paladin..Boy and i was about to hit the
cancel button hehe...then in freeport mangaged to get on a boat only to be
killed by a pirate...over and over...and soemhow i got a troll sk to 45...odd
