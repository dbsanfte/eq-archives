Hehehehe... I see you understand.  =)  Truly, it's quite mind-numbing.

Ah.  To tell the truth I never checked.  Cleric undead nukes pale in
comparison to Condemnation, and the undead dots are useless to the point of
being silly.  Admittedly, I haven't tried the new PoP undead dot, but I
don't expect it to become a regular part of my repertoire, either.

Yeah, we had a couple of gates, and one that was annoying (hello, seven new
mobs).  There was lots of cajoling by our officers for everyone to pay
attention.  I settled for sticking in "The Fellowship of the Ring" and
listening to the audio commentaries while healing and buffing.

We did that the second time, and it worked a lot better.  Hopefully next
time the clearing will go much faster now that we've learned our lessons
about a few key spots.

Hehehehehehe.  =D

D'oh!  I didn't know that.  Good to know.  =)

We had a wizzie accidentally click on that orb for no good reason, and he
had to sheepishly ask to be CotH'd back in.

As an aside, on Sunday we went back in and cleared some of the side boss
mobs we'd left up the day before.  One of them was off a room with a
spinning sword in the middle.  I asked, "What happens if you click the
sword?"  I was told, "Go ahead, Monual.  Try it."  So, knowing that I was
risking getting ported off somewhere and dying gruesomely, I clicked the
sword.  All that happened was that it stopped spinning.  I reported this,
and was told, "You broke the sword!"  =)  In truth, I have no idea if the
sword has any purpose at all, other than to stay there and spin.

Hehehe.  I deserve that.  On Sunday I bound myself in UP.  I fear to bind
anywhere near VT, though, in case Rumblecrush finds me and deathloops me.

I actually remembered you talking about how annoying it was to run into
Rumblecrush while trying to make a naked CR to VT.  =)

Hehehehe.  Them were funny.

/shrug.  Dunno.  I think it was because the antechamber was a convenient
place to CR if we wiped to her.

Debuff AHR?  Dunno, not my department.  =)  We have two very good shamans -
each an officer in the respective guilds that make up our alliance - and
they usually do a good job with the debuffs and whatnot.

Just one.  Ironically it was a monk, who took a good-natured ribbing from
the rest of us for not practicing his safe-fall skill.  =)

We also had one of our clerics recover her concentration mid-air and cast a
Complete Heal before falling back to the ground.  I tried to duplicate her
feat but never could.

*Ouch*.  Never seen that; I can imagine how utterly annoying that would be.

:D  Goot point.

Hehe.  Fortunately, our guild leaders seem to recognize that good loot is
needed by everyone.  Yeah, usually the officers get the first of any new
uber-loot we uncover, but that's all right with me because they usually go
the longest without new loot anyway.  I was surprised that none of our
officers wanted that Essence; perhaps they were truly going on who would get
the most utility out of it.

Sadly, I usually don't get mana regen items any more, since my FT12 is
higher than most of the rest of the guild.  Is it my fault I spent so much
time in CT camping those darned boots?  :)  Still, I fully understand their
rationale; better to shore up someone else's FT than max out mine.  That
will also probably put me far down the list for the Essence.  But that's
fine; what I really lust for is the Mail.

I had to have someone tell me what Vengeance was during the VT raid.  I can
clearly see that it's not cleric loot at all; in fact, I often marvel that
items like that are marked CLR-useable when no sane guild would award one to
a cleric.

We're also talking about parking mage bots to bypass some of the early
content.  The problem is that we have no mage bots; all of our mages
actually play the game.

Thanks, James.  =)
