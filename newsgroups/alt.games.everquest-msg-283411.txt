Yeah it's mostly useful to finding a lost member especially if the
find path leadership "encounters mysterious force" and no tracker in
group to hunt down the wayward adventurer.  My guildie ranger is very
glad because she was tired of helping track down lost peeps.

There's a number of people on EQ forum that is demanding refund of
leadership points since the find path to pc is now useless with the
map.  I find that laughable, spend those points in what?  hmmm.. most
people I know got the find very last and as a result nothing else to
buy.
