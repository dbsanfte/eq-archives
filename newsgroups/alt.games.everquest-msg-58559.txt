All the examples you give are mostly RP though. The same question
could be asked from the evil perspective and characters could
choose to `cross over'. Heck, it would be sort of interesting to
have amiable status with orcs :)

The real point is to avoid travelling there while in a group with
KoS folks. I imagine it doesn't take many `oops' to get you in
the badbooks. Likewise, as in the druid in the PoG, don't in any
way aid other adventurers hunting in those regions.

(The faction system is quite intricate, and at this point still
totally baffling. I couldn't even do the DF belt quest in freeport
because I had only the barest notion of what all the faction hits
meant.)
