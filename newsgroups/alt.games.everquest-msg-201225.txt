I'm sorry to tell you the answer is no...

I'd still recommend the series.  1-6 are great.  7, 8 and 9 are
not as great, but still entertaining.  10 is a real snoozer, and
I think you could actually skip it and just read some quick
summaries on the web.

Theoretically he intends to conclude things in 3-4 more books.

After book 10, though, I'm in no hurry for book 11 anymore.
