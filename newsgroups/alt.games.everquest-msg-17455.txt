It'd probably be farily hard to exploit, seeing as how you'd have to
time dying *just* as you zone.  What are you going to do, stand at the
zone line getting the hell beat out of you and hope that you time it
correctly?  The odds would definatly not be in your favor of being
able to pull this off.

That being said, this exact same concept was once the foundation for
many a corpse duping bug.  If you died while zoning, there would be a
chance of you zoning out alive, with your dead "body" still waiting on
the other side of this zoneline.  This is probably why they won't dare
try to fix the new bug that popped up since then.
