I'm getting ready to buy a new PC...  I'm sick of the lag I'm getting
whenever my clip plane is above 5%.

So when I head into best buy and do that "build your own system"
thing...  which video card should I go for?  The ATI Radeon, or the
GEForce cards?

Anything else I should get to enhance the "EQperience?"

(Also, and somewhat off topic... let's say I go with one card over the
other... what if anything, will I be losing?  I also want to do some
video editing (I've got a seperate video card for capture, though).)

Thanks all...

-J-
