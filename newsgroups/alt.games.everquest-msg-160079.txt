<snipped all> (which is allowed in the netiquette)

Shamelessly copied from: http://www.html-faq.com/etiquette/?toppost

One reason why top-posting is so disliked is that those who do it very rarely
bother to snip any of the preceding post(s) - they leave masses of quoted text
trailing underneath their (frequently very brief) reply. This is very wasteful
of resources, especially for those with slow dial-up connections, or those who
may be downloading to a laptop from a mobile phone. It is a habit which many
people get into when using e-mail (when it does have some logic to support it,
especially when the e-mails are taking place within a large organisation), and
which they carry over into news without realising that the two mediums are very
different in their nature, or that there could be any other way of doing it. The
days when people were required to lurk and learn for six months before posting
are long gone!

The next reason is that it is actually logical that the question should come
before the answer. To quote a poster in another newsgroup:

A. No.
Q. Does top-posting make sense? (note from Daedalus: see how the answer is
topposted to the question. Now imagine 20 messages topposted like this, would
anybody be able to understand it?)

A third reason is that it is often better for a reply to be interleaved with the
quoted text, paragraph by paragraph, as each individual point is answered.
Imagine if this were to be done with the reply before the quote, rather than
after it!

A fourth reason is that, although there are some groups where top-posting is
tolerated or even encouraged, it is generally discouraged, and it is good
manners in any social situation to go along with what the majority are already
doing when you arrive - e.g. not lighting up in a non-smoking room, or
complaining about smoke in a designated smoking area, or stripping to the buff
in a convent, or hugging your overcoat around you at a nudist camp.

A knock-on effect of this is that the content of a top-poster's post is less
likely to be given attention than if they had posted in accordance with custom
and practice in the group.
