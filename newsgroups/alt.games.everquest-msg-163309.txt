No question about it. Your free to sell off any of the EQ CD's that you
have. All you buy with the EQ CD's is access to the game. However, the
account that you create when you log on to the Sony Servers is a totally
different beast, and is in no way ( legally ) related to the EQ CD's. You
may argue that you are "Buying" your account with you monthly 12.95, but
your argument would be baseless. All your 12.95 a month does is rent you
server space on the Sony Servers. Any and all content ( your account, and
any characters on that account ) are still legally the property of SOE.  In
a stricty legal sense Sony is just letting you use thier stuff, but
retaining full ownership, and any property rights associated with it.
