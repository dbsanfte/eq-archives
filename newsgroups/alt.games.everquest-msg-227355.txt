Because they are likely still monitoring, looking for people who are 
'trying to cheat' perhaps to put the account on a watch for future 
exploits, perhaps to identify people who should have their character and 
assets audited, perhaps both.

<snip rational argument>

The shaman epic situation is a bit special because its grossly 
inconsistent. Repeating quests for faction is an accepted and required 
aspect of the game. I would challenge SOE to fix the quest so that parts 
cannot be skipped, and lose the 'too much faction' bandage, precisely 
because it is inconsistent with the rest of the game.

Other cheats from pathing bugs to plat dupes are consistently called 
cheats. Exploiting pathing bugs, item dupes. etc is *never* a normal 
accepted and required part of play.

(And to be fair I myself have made limited use of pathing bugs, when 
running at low health for example, I'll dodge left knowing that the mob 
will fire off to the right for a couple seconds giving me a much better 
shot at making it to the zone... but really, can I reasonably be 
expected to deliberately eat a death??) But I've never sat in the middle 
of one levelling off the fact that the mobs never get to me.
