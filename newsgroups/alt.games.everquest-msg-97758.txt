    Couldn't both be accomplished at once? I know, it's Verant, we should be
cynical - but couldn't it? Damnit, am I the only sucker in town that wants
to believe that this time they not only get it, but have the will to
implement what needs to be done? I hated the idea of changing the mid-range
dungeons - until I found out they're refurbishing all the low and mid-end
zones. I can give them this one chance to show they love EQ as a game, and
not as a profit centre, like we do - can you?
