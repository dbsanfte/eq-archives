Where does he now spawn? In the first room with the step,
or the attached room with the Dark Elf?

I was using hit and run tactics along with judicous use of
snare to pull to the nearby Sol B zone. I'd then let the
other agroed mobs go back to their spawn points and re-zone
with my target standing there waiting.

This was at 38, it was a battle but possible. I just never
saw the High Shaman, because I wasn't sure which was his
place holder. The maps show him where the Dark Elf now is.
