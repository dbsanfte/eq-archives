Wha...?

Complete Heal is a level *39* spell.

The big deal about 56 as a cleric is the 96% rez. Plus the proccing
hammer and Yaulp V, if you want to try battle clericking.

None of these change the basic mechanics of playing a cleric. (Anyone
who thinks soloing a 56 cleric via melee is a viable option is invited
to try it.) The normal exp group is still stand, CH, sit down, with the
occasional burst of smaller heals in the event of adds or aggro on
group members other than the MA. (*)

The main thing to change high-level play as a cleric is the Planes, where
MOBs hit fast and hard, a slower becomes almost mandatory, and if somebody
other than the MA gets beaten on they need to be healed *right*now* or
they will die. (Insane healing aggro used to be a problem as well, but
this was fixed a while back.)

        ...Ronny

(*) OK, so I'm simplifying a little. Shoot me.
