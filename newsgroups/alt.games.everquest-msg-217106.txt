Note: I was talking about the normal random named here, not
assassination targets. 

Working under the assumption that the trash mobs in are about as tough
as the targets for an assassinate on normal difficulty, tanking them
wouldn't be a problem if their slow mitigation wasn't too bad. 

A Boss mob that hits for 1300(?) would be tough if his slow mitigation
was more that 25%. Hell, for our group he'd be tough even if he didn't
mitigate slow <g>.

That's what I wasn wondering, if a bard could lull pull there it
would've definitely made things easier.

Pally isn't nearly as good a pure tank right now as the SKs, she's
working on SU3 before her defensive AAs while the SK has all of his
AAs in tanking abilities. 

I'd much prefer to have a SK pull and tank, given the lack of DPS in
the group trying to win the adventure isn't an option anyway but I'm
hoping if we could take down a named or two in two hours and get some
decent gear upgrades for people that won't ever see VT or Tier 4. 

There is some flexibility as to classes but I don't see who I'd
replace with a DPS class in that group, at least until we gain some
more AAs and experience doing the hard stuff. 

Thanks for the info, 

Frank
