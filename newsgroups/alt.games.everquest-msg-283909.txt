I sure agree with this.  There's nothing better than being able to walk
in to pretty much any starting city at indifferent.  My High Elf was
screwing around in Nektulous and I wanted to buy a few things...why not
go to Neriak?  I can be a Dark Elf if I want, and since I'm agnostic,
most of them are indifferent when I look like an Inky.  (A few were
dubious, probably because I didn't follow CT or Inny or something).
