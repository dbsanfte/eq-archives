    Been in a guild that had this happen (my first, the all-dwarf guild),
and been in a guild that made the transition. If you want to prevent it,
there's a few things you can do:

1) Raise the minimum level to join - say, make it 36 or higher. The key to
getting a guild that sticks together is to get a guild that does things
together that are useful to everyone involved. By closing the level gap
between highest and lowest members, you ensure that you can at least do
SOMETHING with a fellow guildmate other than chat and PL them.
2) Start active raids. LOTS of active raids. No, more than that. Make sure
they're fun events (fun usually equals good XP, phat lewt, or seeing
something they'd never see otherwise), so people don't feel burdened raiding
all the time. Raids eat XP more often than not. By slowing everyone's XP
gain rate, you ensure people who begin close in levels stay close in levels.
You also reduce contact with "outside influences" that could steal your
people.
3) Make sure all of a player's alts are with your guild. You can keep track
of them better that way, and take people aside to talk to if they're lagging
behind "the pack" because of alt time. It doesn't have to be a
confrontational, "level with us or begone!" sort of thing. But use emotional
pressure: "I miss you when you aren't around, I'm worried I'll leave you
behind, aren't you tired of killing the same low level mobs over and over,
we're having so much FUN - come and join us....."

    Do I agree with this? Lord, no. I left the all-dwarf guild when, after
everyone above me, and almost everyone blue to me had left, the guildmaster
wouldn't allow members' alts to join so I could continue to chat with my
guild friends even when not grouped with them. As a high-level unguilded
cleric I get all the sales pitches from top guilds, and I tell them not
until I'm 60. I'm worried what will happen when I hit 60 and they all come
calling. ;-) But I will tell you, the above three points are common to every
successful guild I've seen stay together over time.
