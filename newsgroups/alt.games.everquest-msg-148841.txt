Nah, takes all the fun out of it for me at least. What I would like in
a game is the ability to do quests, big quests, and all types of
things solo from level 1 and on. I don't want to just buy a character
at like level 60 and just have AA points to work on. One reason is the
equipment you have would probably be crap, the next would be that
these type of characters would be false level 60's which would not be
prepared for all the raids and crap other people are counting on you
to be ready for if you're in a group, and 3rd if you can just buy
level 60 for 30 bucks there's no point in playing the game. If they
ever did that I think I'd just quit, I didn't spend hours upon hours
upon hours exp grinding and group searching as a wizard, on an
unstable connection therefore non soloable, just to be slapped in the
face by some money making ploy that is taking place of them fixing the
game so it's not so boring to get from level 50-60. They need to make
solo a very important part of the game for exp and grouping just a
good way to take out many higher level mobs for maybe a bit more exp
but mainly very good equipment and such. Erm so I guess to answer your
question no I wouldn't. :p
