i was told to forward ports 1024-7000 to my PC..

forwarding those didnt work.

however, i have to assume ports have something to do with it, because when i
forward ALL ports to my computer, I can log in.

me and my friend are at different locations, both with broadband, and the
same style "PC to RT314 Router to modem" connection.

he uses DHCP though, while i use Static IP.

it has always worked for me until recently though.
