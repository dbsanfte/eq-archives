True enough.  I admit I used the "no loss" conversion more when I was
in my 30s.  Now that I'm farming Hill Giants in Rathe, I do go to the
gem vendor in that zone and convert coins to rubies.  I then either
eat the loss on selling back the rubies, or put them up in the bazaar
for just a shade less than what the NPC charged me.  (Frankly, I could
probably get away with charging more than NPCs, which is really weird,
but I'll settle for not taking a loss. :-)
