Because its Annie and therefore some people will be compelled to
defend her regardless of her actions?

She may be a "nice person" but that didn't stop her from telling me I
didn't know what I was talking about, that I didn't know the
definitions of words, that I was flapping my cock around, that I was
trying to tell people what to post, that I was lying, and that I was a
hypocrite, now did it?

Good thing she's a "nice person". Someone else might have been
expected to defend themselves.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"

- Dolorous Edd Tollett, "Clash of Kings" (George R R Martin)
