I installed a fresh copy of Windows, then checked with Spybot and AdAware to
get a baseline, then visited Allakhazam's EQ1 and EQ2 sites several times.

Result: no spyware.

The only thing you'll get from that site is the usual cookies from the
banner ads.  They do have banner ads from third party ad networks, and
so those could conceivably try to install real spyware.  However, those
same ads will be on many other sites, and so if your computer is so badly
configured or administered as to allow that work, you'll be so infested from
general web surfing that you would not be able to notice anything extra from
ads that happen to be on Allakhazam's pages.
