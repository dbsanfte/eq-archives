I just did this last week with my cleric.  Had a group comprising of a
58 Necro, 53 druid, 54 warrior, myself as a 55 cleric and a 52 Ranger.
5 person group.
I practiced the run 3 or 4 [dozen] times first.  Then I did the
turn-in and immediately fired DA and ran like heck.  The group was
waiting by the zone and we took the priest down pretty easily.  We are
far far far from Uber.  So far that I'm still quite nervous about the
Ixiblat attempt this coming monday!

I got in a few stuns, but mostly focused on keeping folks healed and
some nuking.
