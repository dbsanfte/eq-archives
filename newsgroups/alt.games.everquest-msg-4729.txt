I have a female half-elf ranger, and no matter what I wear, I can't seem to
cover my naked ass!

I've tried Leather, raw-hide, even Mammoth hide leggings, which appear
visible on a wood elf, but not on me!

What do I have to wear that will be visible, or better yet, what do I have
to do to make what I have on - visible?
