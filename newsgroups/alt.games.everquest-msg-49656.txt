First I'd like to thank everyone for their comments :-)  It's already
helped me in getting my Enchanter's spell casting skill up!

I have one follow-up question that is somewhat related to the original
topic:  Grouping.  Here's the snip that sparked my question:

How are points awarded when grouping with different levels in a group?

If a mob is green to me but blue to someone else in the group, do they get
all the exp points, or do they just get their share (e.g. 1/4th in a 4 person
group) while I don't get any?

I'm wondering this because last night my 7th level enchanter grouped with
a nearly naked 3rd level druid carrying a club... we fought orcs and the
druid still got xp (though I don't know how much).

In the other case, let's say the mob is blue to me and red to the lower level,
how does the splitting work?  Is there a formula somewhere?

It would be helpful to understand the reasoning and formula behind it
in order to know how to better arrange a group.

Thanks for any info :-)
