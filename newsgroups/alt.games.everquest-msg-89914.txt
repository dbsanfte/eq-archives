Ranger warrior combo?  You need to find a zone with high blue animals, and
snare/fear kite them.  Iceclad might actually work with the cougars there,
just pull them down to near the dock first with either a bow, or snare,
then, if you pulled with a bow, snare them, then fear them, and both of you
can whack away at them while they crawl away from you.  Recast fear as
needed.
