SOE blew it.  The <60 versions are on the gnome in
the bazaar on test - but not on live.  The 61 version
is quested, but no one has seen the cohesion gem
drop yet.  The only way you can get a summoned BA
item atm is to have a 63+ mage who has the spell
Summon Jewelry Bag get one for you, because it does
come in there.
