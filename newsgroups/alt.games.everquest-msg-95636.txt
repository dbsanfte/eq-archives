No clue at your uber level.  At my level, my pooch can often do more
or similar damage as an untwinked melee character, plus the damage I
do.  Kind of 1.75+ melee all rolled up in one package.  That, and a
subset of the shaman line of spells ain't bad.

I ain't gonna say its the class of the future, but 'tis a fun class to
play if you're not racing for the end-game. (just imho - I know
there's already a shit-load of lvl 60 BSTs out there.)
