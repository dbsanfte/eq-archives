This assumes that there are zones.  What if the game is zoneless?

Also, I doubt the kiting trick would work.  I'd expect the mobs to have at
least three states:

    1. Idle

    2. Engaged

    3. Returning

It would only be while in the "returning" state that they would have the
special no-aggro behaviour.  When being kited, they would be in the engaged
state.

Finally, if they are being kited, wouldn't the anti-KS rules apply, and so
even if you can pull one off, you wouldn't get the credit for killing it?
That would go to the kiter.
