I second this notion if it's just the two of you.  The experience
won't be insane (especially for the 44), but it will be steady and
there isn't too much danger if you're looking for a safe place to
level.  Can get a bit crowded at prime time, but there are tons of
mobs so it's not usually a big problem.

Dreadlands I found too laggy and spiders have a habit of creeping up
behind you.  And two people do not usually a dungeon party make.

Another possibility though might be Rathe Mountain giants, although I
have to insert the caveat here that I've never tried them with a melee
character.  Seems to me with a cleric to heal you and root (or fear,
if you have some form of Snare) the mob, you should be ok.  And you
probably know the loot on them is quite nice.  Go at off-peak times if
possible.
