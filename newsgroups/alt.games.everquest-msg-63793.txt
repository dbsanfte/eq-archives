People join the armed forces with high ideals. When it comes to fighting,
your own skin will tend to take priority over lofty national goals. The
japanese in WWII being spectacular exceptions.

5000 years of warfare is mostly conscripted peons who would have run as far
as they could in an actual battle if doing so wouldn't get them killed by
the mounted folks on their own side for cowardice-in-the-face.

The "higher cause" throughout the history of war has been one of the
following:
1) Those guys have stuff we want, let's go get it from them
2) Those guys are trying to take the stuff we have, let's stop them
3) Those guys have a wierd idea about god, and must die.

These ideas are things only really thought about by the Nobility/Generals
in charge...footsoldiers have much more basic ideas about the nature of
war. In DAoC, because death is a nonpermenant thing, you can die and say
"well, I did my realm good" (at least, until 3 days later when the other
realm takes back whatever you just captured)...I doubt many soldiers have
died saying "Well, my high ideals are better served now"

No, historically, most soldiers joined the army thinking "Why did I have to
be passed out in a gutter when the press gang showed up" and "how can I get
out of this alive".
