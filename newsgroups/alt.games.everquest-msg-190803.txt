Ok basically being as it's irrelevant - SOE isn't going to fix something
that nobody actually cares about, I wont give a full reply. But the basic
gist of what I would say is:

* You are overestimating the difficulty, although possibly not by much,
depending on what IS logged now

* "impossible" is a four letter word.

* the cpu impact of logging is not anywhere near as brutal as you seem to
think
