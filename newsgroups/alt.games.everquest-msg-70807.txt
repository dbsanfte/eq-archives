For what it's worth, the highest rogue in our guild solo'd it. Balls of
solid brass or brain of solid bone? You be the judge. But he pulled it
off. The really shocking part was that he solo'd his way all the way to
the nightstand and found that the book was NOT there. DOH! So, does he
gate out to try again another day? Nooooooooo. HE CAMPS THERE!

Camped back in ten hours later, somehow stayed alive to get the book,
then gated out. I think there's a certain insanity requirement you have
to pass when you join the rogues guild.
