Hi Carsten,
You can do a similar thing, in order to raise your skills during 
fighting, by defining two-lines hotkeys for each combat/magic skill 
and for spells: the first line will be a skill to raise (eg. Sense 
Heading) and the second one have to be your regular command (eg. 
Attack, a spell, run... a command you use very often during 
fighting or XPing).

So each time you use one of these commands, you also practive a 
non-fighting skill. Ideal to raise the later abilities you got in 
your levels
