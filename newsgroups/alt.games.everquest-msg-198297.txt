That's one thing I love about a shaman main.  I get the benefit of being 
very desirable for groups, or, when I feel antisocial, I can go solo in 
quite a number of places.  When I feel like having mindless easy soloing 
fun, I go to FG and tank shrooms (many of which are still dark blue to me 
at 61).
