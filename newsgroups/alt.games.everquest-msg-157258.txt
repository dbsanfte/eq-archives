Well, there are a number of explanations.  The most obvious is that
you are wrong on both counts.

First, you are wrong about the value of small arms, both in terms
of the effectiveness of one man and in terms of the effectiveness
of an insurgency armed primarily with small arms.  

Second you are wrong in the claim that you have "better" freedom of speech
in Australia.  In fact, you have hate speech laws, more restrictive
defamation laws, and a more active censorship movement in academe.
In particular, the Racial Hatred Act of 1995 prohibits all 
offensive public acts based on race.  The pending anti-espionage
bill provides many more restrictions than anything envisioned
by the US Patriot Act.

There is no explicit right to free speech in the Australian 
Constitution.  In fact, attempts to create an explicit constitutional
freedom of speech were unsuccessful in 1942, 1944, 1972 and 1985.
The 1992 High Court opinion held only that political speech was 
protected, not speech in general.  Moreover, some kinds of 
political speech are not protected including, oddly, encouraging
people to fill in their ballots incorrectly.

Both the US and Australia have idiosyncratic limitations on
speech.  However, the lack of an explicit guarantee
of freedom of speech and the lack *either* an explicit
or implied right of free speech for non-political speech
makes it hard to argue that Australian speech is better
protected, particularly in light of the Orwellian speech
restrictions in some areas of Australian academe.

But thanks for playing.
