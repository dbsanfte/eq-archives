They oughta go with something along the lines of Dan Day's suggestion
to add triggerable epic mobs that <are> epic.  If you could follow a
set path to trigger a significantly more powerful version of Ragefire
in some suitably out-of-the-way location (you think he's upset when
you accost him while he's out and about in Skyfire?  wait'll you see
how he feels about having his afternoon tea interrupted!).  That way
the powerful guilds would have a way to get their clerics the epic
without bullying everybody else, the almost-powerful guilds could
ally to the same effect, and the "regular" Rage camp would be there
for the more ordinary immortals.
