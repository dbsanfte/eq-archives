It's supposedly fixed, and a friend's guild did it recently and it went 
without a hitch.  We had a problem with that waypoint, though.  The General 
was "swimming" ( stationary ) on Pirate Island, about a 15 second walk from 
his end-point.  We talked about it for a minute and then I told the raid 
"This is about the time Xalbus will go LD anyway..." and 2 seconds later, 
Xalbus ( the guy doing his shawl ) did go LD.  My suggestion was to have 
the monk with us pull the General closer to the camp and FD when Xalbus 
logs back in, but someone petitioned it and a guide showed up right as 
Xalbus got logged.

The guide cast a debuff on the General then mem blurred him about 10 times 
and the Dorf continued on to the ending.

During the escort, I had to blur the General 2 different times, and ( 
luckily ) he didn't warp back to his starting spot.

All in all, it was a crazy event - the most chaotic one I have been party 
to.  I combined my 5th shawl last night and can't imagine the stress Xalbus 
was under worrying about having to do all those armor combines again if 1 
thing went wrong on the escort.
