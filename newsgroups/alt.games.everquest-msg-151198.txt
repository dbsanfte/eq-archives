Hmm. I was, like most people, scared off from AO by its release. I
also didn't think much of  the idea of mission boxes and I still hear
nothing but complaints about technical problems.

Unlike most other people though I was also afraid of its spec
requirements. My computer whined when I zoned into Dawnshroud,
squealed in pain when zoning into Bazaar, and any time I came near
Shar Vahl or thought of making a Vah Shir the sound would miraculously
come on and say "What are you doing, Ben? I'm sorry, Ben, I'm afraid I
can't let you do that. The mission is too important for me to allow
you to jeopardize it." AO had spiffy graphics, I think my poor
computer might not have the moxy to handle it.
