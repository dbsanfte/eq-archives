If this is EQ2, the numerous posts about people losing
quests/abilities when zoning might be the cause of it...and, if so,
I'm glad it's being looked at. Even if they don't know what's causing
it, taking down the servers when there's a bug which causes damage to
earned abilities strikes me as a Good Thing.

Which would you rather:
a)Play for hours and then find it all wiped by a bug?
b)Not play, but not lose anything?

If this is about EQ1, then, I have no comment. :)
