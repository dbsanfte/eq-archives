Everquest is very much an international game.  In the game itself, I've
spoken to in, or overheard folk talking in German, French, Spanish, Arabic,
Japanese, and probably Korean and Chinese.  Those were just the languages I
could recognize.

English isn't everyone's first language, and there's no requirement that one
has to speak/read/write English before posting in any NG.  Quite a few can
read English, but don't feel comfortable enough with their secondary
language skills to write in English (just as I can read basic French and get
the gist, but wouldn't dare try to post anything beyond the most basic of
phrases in French, as I am confident that I would butcher even that, and
embarrass myself.)

BTW, almost half the French stuff I see posted here is spam aimed at French
speaking players....so you aren't missing that much.  But the genuine
players who post here in other languages do not wish to piss others
off....they're after information, just like most of the rest of us.

EQ and this newsgroup are part of the internet, which is an international
community.  You cannot spend too much time on the net without running into
other languages.  English is not the only major language on the net.  Other
very important internet languages include:  German, French, Polish,
Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Russian, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Finnish,
Turkish, and Arabic.  Learning just a bare smidgen of one of these other
languages can expand your internet horizons considerably.
