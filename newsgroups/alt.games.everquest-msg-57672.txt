The stat bonuses on crafted are crap compared to dark forge and now, there
is Sentient armour, for all the troll and ogre warriors that need to bump up
their intelligence :�)

On the subject of twinks, spend some time in EC and you'll see everyone and
their dog makes an SK twink...then gives up 20 levels later (evil character,
no self invis till 30th blah blah) I've managed to get some nice items cheap
thanks to this repeated trend :�)
Most people stick with warriors (in fact, often the warrior is the original
character that was put on hold while something more interesting, challenging
or effective, is played to high level)
