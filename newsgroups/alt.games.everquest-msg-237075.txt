> Doh!

> Anyone else?

I had lots of the falling out tree episodes, having been born in Kelethin,
but drowning in Crushbone was good time as well... Especially when

I am in water, lower level, swimming [ barely ] in a blind panic as two orc
Centurions who obviously have taken swimming lessons are beating the crap
out of me... I am trying for find a spot where I can get back on shore and
end up in a corner facing a steep cliff where I promply die.

Upon returning to this location, wondering how I am going to get my
underwater body without drowning, I can see clearly it is not there.  I was
sure I was at the right spot!  I search up and down the river, naked and
trying to dodge orcs, and with the help of a higher level I had never met
before, found myself.

Or rather, found a toe...

By drowning/dying while swimming into a corner of two walls, I fell into the
wall and my body was inaccessible, except for one toe sticking out of the
wall on the very bottom of the river.

DOH!

If you are going to drown, do it in the middle of the river...
