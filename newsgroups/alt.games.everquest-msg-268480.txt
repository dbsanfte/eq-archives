The RP servers (of which there are 4 or 5 now) have strictly enforced
naming policies, it's just that somewhere over 1 quarter of a million
new names were made in the space of a couple of days.  Given the number
of people I've already seen complain about changes, I'd say they're
policing as well as they can.  

Interesting note, do you remember when EQ made a big deal about hitting
100k concurrent users?  WoW hit that first night.  Something like
250,000 units sold through in the US (and it released in Korea too). 
This is not a WoW is better than sliced bread yadda yadda yadda
statement, but rather just a "wow".  That's a heck of a lot of
population to absorb in a couple of days.
