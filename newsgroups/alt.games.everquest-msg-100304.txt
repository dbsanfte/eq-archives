I would like to remind Verant that Magicians are masters of conjuring 
elementals to fight by their side.  Sometimes the elemtals take the form 
of monsters to make things a little more interesting.  This is our 
primary form of damage dealing.

Magicians need monster upgrades.  The first day Everquest was released 
our top-level pet was level 49.  Fine for back then.  Since that day not 
a single pet has ever been received that has gone beyond level 49.  Not 
one.  Some are a little tougher than or original, but that is all.  Even 
our epic is level 49.

Every person playing a magician realizes that our existence revolves 
around our pets.  Not nuking.  Not summoning people.  Pets.

We need to start getting pet upgrades.  Currently at level 51+ magcian 
pets are too weak to effectively deal with the higher level mobs.

Honestly, I would be happy if Verant would just remove some of our 
"summoning" and nuking capability and simply improve our elementals.  If 
I wanted to be a nuker I would play a wizard.  I find wizards too one-
dimensional to play and tire of melee classes.  Only the magician is 
entertaining and my pet is amazing.  Other classes love to see sexy 
armor and awe-popping weapons; I love to see a powerful elemental.

Please improve our elemental handling capabilities by improving our 
elementals, our elemental healing spells, our elemental buffs, our 
CONJURED attacks, but please please stop giving us junk not relevant to 
our mastery.

I am ELEMENTALIST.
