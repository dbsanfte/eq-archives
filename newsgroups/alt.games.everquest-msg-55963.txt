Do what I did.
Map the "/", "*" and "+" keys on your number pad to be the first three
user-defined hotkeys. Set up a seperate panel of hotkeys for Group battles,
Solo battles, Charming, and Travelling. Put the songs you wanna twist in the
same first three positions on each panel. I also have my melee slots and
instruments on each panel too, so I can twist them as needed too, although I
do that manually with the mouse.
Someone told me you could set up macros for twisting songs using the
socials, but Im not sure how it works.
I dunno if this is better than your present set-up, but it works for me!)
