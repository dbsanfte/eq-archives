Bad clerics do things other than buff and heal, inappropriately
Average clerics do nothing but buff and heal
Good clerics do things other than buff and heal, as appropriate.

Take, for example, the wily Cobalt Drake.  Face one down
with a cleric who thinks buff and heal is the job description,
and you are in for a bumpy ride indeed... 500point AOE
that also annuls those precious buffs right off you, another
description of your condition would be toast.

Chain stun, on the other hand, and the drake gets off
only one or two if he's lucky.

Fear, and the drake has even less to say.

Root... and you just found one of those "inappropriate"
clerics!

Lets go to Karnors.  Welcome to the spectral curate.
Lets try tanking it with Joe Averagecleric.  This isn't
going too badly, we are staying more or less healed,
the cleric's mana is slowly dropping, but heck, the
mob is almost... fully healed.  hmm, we start over,
only cleric is now at 60M.  Ok, he's healed again,
cleric at 20M.  20M? Takes 40M for us to get this
guy down to the point where he Cheals!  Jane
Supercleric walking by sees we are in trouble, hangs
out, casts exactly one spell, a level 5 stun, just as
the mob starts its CHeal cast... and we kill it.  Joe is
OOM, we are all almost dead, and Jane, who really
should get the credit for the kill, is down so little mana
that she can't even see the difference in her manabar.

Sure, there are other people who can do those jobs,
maybe even do them better than a cleric. In an
ideal group, you'll have those people and can
safely rely on the cleric as backup.  But what I was
saying is, the job of the cleric depends on the situation,
the group composition, and the battle plan of the day.
What if you don't have that ideal group?  What if you
did but someone is on soda break, OOM, LD, or
simply not good at -their- job?
