Uhm...go back and read the thread again.  I did not suggest that guilds give
that information out on their website or tells.  I sarcastically asked if
the person in the raiding guild expected people to be able to find it out
that way and thus relieve him of the need to tell them if he is likely to
have time for LDoN.

My point is that it is each players responsibility to figure out if their
guild obligations are likely to interfere with a group they join, and tell
the group, rather than expect the group to notice their guild tag, and
assume that people in raiding guilds might be called away at any moment.
