I don't think it's your place to tell group mates what buffs they should or
shouldn't get as long as the request is ANYWHERE NEAR reasonable.  A ranger
who asks for an enchanter's shitty 10 STR buff spell might be asking for it
because he NEEDS it, and unless you want to give them the third degree
before casting it, just cast it and stop being so argumentative when it's
extremely cheap to cast.

I'm not saying you should keep pallies and rangers buffed with Insight or
Enlightenment if all they're doing is meleeing, but if they're pulling then
it's somewhere "near reasonable" for them to ask.

And if someone asks for "zing," (stamina refresh) DO feel free to ask them
what their STA is, and educate them that if it's 100+ and they don't need to
jump, they also don't need the zing.  At that point, ignore all further
requests...if someone else wants to waste their mana for no reason at all,
it's their problem.

Before Luclin I'd conveniently miss requests for Insight/Brilliance when I
knew their WIS/INT was above 190 and they were never out of mana as it was.
That's an option for ya, too. :)
