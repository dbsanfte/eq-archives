I highly doubt there's a file on the client side that has any "important"
info...IF there was, it would basically ruin the game, because of the
cheat/trainers that could easily dupilcate stuff on a local
machine(Diablo).....Also, look at it this way, you can log your account on
from any computer with EQ loaded, and all your stuff is there, characters,
everything...client downloads it when you log in.....

I'm not saying you can't cheat...I believe you can cheat in any game....it's
just not as easy as your tech guy is thinking....
