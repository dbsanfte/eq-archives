I've never understood why SOE leaves bard songs working this way.

Rather than encouraging customers to develop medical problems such
as carpal tunnel syndrome, why not let bards play multiple songs

Maybe let them only sing 1 song at first, and maybe 2 starting at
level 15, 3 starting at level 30, etc.

Why make them keep clicking?
