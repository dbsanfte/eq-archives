The basis of the story is that your homeworld has been utterly destroyed.
Fortunately you had a huge mothership created that has hundred of thousands
of people in cold storage, as well as research facilities and construction
sites.  So your goal is to fight off the enemy forces that are trying to
finish you off while at the same time trying to find a new homeworld.

You have the usual: research trees to enable better weapons and ships,
construction of more and better units, harvesting of resources, etc.  What
really makes it stand out is that it's all in three dimensions - you don't
do things on a flat plane.  Indeed, if you do, you won't possibly succeed.
You constantly have to adjust your perspective around all three axis to
acomplish anything.

Plus the graphics were good for their day and still hold up well now.  The
music was nice and mildly creepy, giving you this feeling of being alone in
a vast empty space.

The thing I liked the best was setting up formations.  Your ships could be
set up in a variety of formations - defensive, offensive, box, whatever.
The formations, too, were truly three-dimensional.  I liked creating swarms
of little ships, setting them up in the "claw" formation, and watching them
wreak havoc on the bigger enemy ships.  =)

Highly recommended if you're into RTS games.
