On my 5th set, my low level char had to sit for several 
hours watching red con Zephyl running by many times taunting 
him. I targeted him and read a book, occasionally watching 
the screen to see if the target box had cleared indicating 
Zephyl had despawned. Then it was a matter of killing the "a 
drake" once before Hasten motored by. There's a spot near 
the Feerrott zone line where Hasten stops to catch his 
breath, so even a char without SoW can run up and hail him. 
You can safely sit on the mountain side watching down the 
valley for the fast moving black spot approaching.

Hmmm, didn't try two chars in sequence, but several years 
(wow, it has been that long...) ago, I got JBoots for my 
Necro and Pally one right after the other with a friend 
hailing Hasten to keep him in place while I logged out one 
char and logged the other. The "hailer" was holding the 
second rapier.

I have a couple of extra rings on my Necro and Pally, I'm 
going to try two exchanges and see what happens.
