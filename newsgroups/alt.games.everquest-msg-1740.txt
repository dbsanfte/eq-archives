Both sphinxes(pl?) are stationary; Zazamoukh (the one you'll be near) should
not be aggro towards you.  As far as the route, follow right wall through
the Innothule Swamp.  Once in the Feerrott, keep invisibility on at all
times, there are wandering Bouncers in the zone.  Follow the left wall to
the river, then turn right and follow the river to the stone bridge (not to
be confused with the fallen pillar).  Cross the bridge and follow the road
to the Rathe Mountain zone.  You'll go straight, rather than left, at the
first intersection, on your way to the Rathe Mtn zone.

Be sure to con that sphinx, it was aggro towards my troll warrior, but you
should be ok.
