>How many EQrs with PS2 will play both Everquest games?

Well, I signed up anyway but I don't currently have a ps2 or broadband
adapter. I plan to get both.

If I had the ps2 and broadband adapter, I'd certainly play the beta.
The beta would decide whether I played ps2 eq but it might be one or
the other. PC eq is pretty long in the tooth, very outmoded, mires me
in a sea of downtime and "work." If I played the ps2 one and it was
the EQ I wanted, I'd jump ship. The same is true of SWG, EQ2, world of
warcraft etc.

I'd like to leave EQ1, but even after three and a half years no mmorpg
maker can give me  a reason to go. Verant hasn't even done it yet
themselves.
