You have to have some time sinks, and not all of them are bad. EXP
lost due to a death is simply part of the risk/reward system. You can
generally make up the loss in the amount of time (or less) that a long
CR would take. The best part is that you get to actually play the game
(ie hunt kill mobs) while doing it.

I could definately go with what you describe above. They could add a
confirmation message (similar to a rez) that gives you the option of
taking the EXP hit and having your corspe summoned to the "safe" evac
part of the zone. You would still have to travel back to your corpse
(assuming you were not bound in the zone), and face any dangers
involved in the trip. It would go a long way towards encouraging
players to explore dungeons at all level ranges instead of taking the
common outdoor safe route to 50+.
