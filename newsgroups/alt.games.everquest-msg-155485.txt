How is this bad?  I mean once you zoned with the pet you had to rebuff it...
now you just cast the spell that you'd use to buff it anyways... to me this
seems easier than having to summon for 10seconds, and then apply buffs.

I don't see how having a pet after you zone is anything special to "draw
alot of people" to play beastlords... The thing is a gimp until you level
buff it.

Please help me understand why you are upset.
