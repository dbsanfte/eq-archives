Well, if you want a count of how many of whatever class are in the
zone, just do a /w shadowknight.  It will give you a list of who the
shadowknights are in the zone and at the bottom it does usually
something like "there are 12 players in Qeynos Hills" or something
like that.  You get a bit more chat spam, but that isn't that big a
deal.
