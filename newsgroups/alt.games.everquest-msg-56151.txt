IIRC high indifferent was the first that i got the stein not, you need
to raise faction (paraphrasing obviously).  If you can get a wolf form,
turn in lizard tails in the shadowknight guild.  You can also do the
bread quest from the karanas, turning in the bread to Innkeeper Gup
(sp?) Who is over near the merchants who sell fletching supplies. 
Wolfform will make you indifferent to Shadowknights, the Ogre guards and
Clurg, you will still be KOS to the Warrior guild and the shaman guild. 
Doing the stein quest will quickly raise your faction, once it will give
you the item.  My druid (in wolf form) is now Amiable to the SK,
Merchants, Clurg and guards, and Dubious to the Warrior guild, haven't
been back to check the shaman since getting killed the one time.  I am
also glares threateningly not  scowls when not in wolf form to the
guards.
