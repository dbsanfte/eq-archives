I've got my own computer (that I paid for) that I lug back and forth, my dad
has a cable modem that I've got networked up to 4 computers (3 when I'm not
there), but it stays there, and I'm too spoiled by it to be able to stand an
analog modem.  I really need to get a job so that I can pay for a cable
modem at my moms myself, since she seems to think that I can't afford it
otherwise. (I'm very conservative with my money)
