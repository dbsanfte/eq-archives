Okay, so this has nothing to do with the subject. I currently have a
31 mage on one account, and a 55 cleric on another. The sheer damage
produced by the mage's firepet's damage shield, combined with the
clerics 15 point damageshield dropped nearly everything in under a
minute up to this point. But the guards in Highkeep, while giving off
an amazing cashflow and decent exp are starting to become a hassle now
that the cat has been let out of the bag. 

Where should I hunt to level the mage? Exp isn't at all a
consideration for the cleric. I've tried Rathe mnts and hill giants,
but it's so overcamped and the exp just isn't good at such a low level
anyway. Also tried GD and the giants there, but it's kinda slow
(though the faction is welcome for my cleric). Any suggestions?

Another question, I've been told that the best pet for tanking is the
earth pet, and that the best all-around is the air pet. Though I've
tried both, I still keep going back to the firepet for his
damageshield. The cleric's HP buffs make HP of little matter when
deciding on a pet. Is there any advantage to the earth or air pet?
Because it doesn't look like it to me so far. Root is no problem,
cleric has that, so that's a benefit that doesn't really help the
earth pet.

Thanks.
