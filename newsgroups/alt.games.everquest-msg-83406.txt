No, that has no bearing on a purchase decision. Verant has a product
they  are selling. If I don't like their product, I don't have to buy
it. My like or dislike of their product has absolutely nothing to do
with my impression of how the manufacturer cares about me as an
individual.

If I want to eat a big mac, I don't care if the burger flipper cares
about what I think. I just want the fucking burger.

But if the title is buggy, the stupid gamers DON'T get to play, and
that is something they DO care about. I think your whole premise is
wrong. Buggy titles get thrashed by the masses, and the sales suffer.
Quality products that give people entertainment are what sell.

Profit and the public perception of quality are already related in a
feedback loop. There will be no profit, if there is no quality, also,
there will be no quality, unless there is profit (with a few fluky
exceptions).
