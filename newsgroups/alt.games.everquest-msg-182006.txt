Hi,

Today I went out and got the Gold Edition after trying out the Classic
version last week.  I had all the expansions checked when I installed
the Gold Edition.  When I go to the graphics options I see a new
screen now with the Luclin models.  Then I noticed that none of
the models in game seemed any better.  And when I tried to make
a Val Shir it gaveme an error saying that I needed the Luclin upgrade.

What did I do wrong?  I thought installing over my old game would be
ok to keep my account and player etc...

Thanks

Jesse
