Karana server about 3 weeks ago.

The great fish off.

Yeah i know sounds dull, but it was actually a greeat laugh,.

Over 200 people sat at the docks near fv fishing for all they're worth.

The gm's playing chars named aptly for the occasion, ol'reelin,fisheye even a
few bait masters handing out poles etc.

There were a few teething troubles at the start - namely they under-estimated
the turnout and ran out of bait fast, but other wise a nice way to waste a
couple of hours.

Winners were judged on the weight of the fish caught, and i think it was the
top 10 who got prizes, nothing spectacular, a few items with eb charges, a
couple of collapsable fishing poles etc.

Not what most people expect from an event but for an off the cuff attempt at a
little amusement to break the usual grinding it made a pleasant change, now if
i can just get my skill up a little higher perhaps i can improve on my 5th
place at the next one. =)
