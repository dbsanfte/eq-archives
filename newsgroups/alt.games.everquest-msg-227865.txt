PoD flies are good, the other PoP charm option is the nightstalker camp in
PoN.  For chant-kiting the golems in PoV or big frogs in forest area of PoS
are good, steady exp.  Haven't tried the ae kiting, check out www.eqdiva.com
maybe they have a guide.  I hear it's dangerous and you need good equip.
