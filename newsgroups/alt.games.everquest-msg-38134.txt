It started with a "D" ( I think ), and had some character screenshots and
some water, and that was about it.  Based on an "evolving" world or
something... you start out as a baby, have parents, etc.  All the terrain
was supposed to be randomly generated, -everything- was suposed to be
ramdom...  Damn, can't think of it.  All PVP, if someone killed you you
were -dead-, game over, birth yourself again.

Was it called "Dawn?"

No matter, really.  It had -way- too many inherant flaws in its concept.
