I can answer that. ^_^  Because you would be a hopeful fool who likes to
tell herself that the folks doing EQ2 are somehow a different species from
the folks in charge of EQ.  And for the moment...man, it sure *feels* that
way.  But I fear that the warm relationship the community currently has
with the EQ2 devs/cs/etc. will start to cool off once the game is live.

I do understand what you are saying. It's a valid concern, and not an easy
one to express.

I can't speak for EQ...I've cut my ties to it very thoroughly.  EQ2...I'm
confident that it could survive CoH.  CoH is a helluva lot of fun but I
don't think it immerses many of us as much as we want to be
immersed.  That and at the end of the day we start missing swords and
dragons and whatnot.

Wow is another story, because many have commented that WoW and EQ2 have a
lot of similarities.  EQ2 has a major weakness going for it, which is the
crappy rep of SOE compared to the good rep of Blizzard. WoW could survive
on sheer anti-SOE-sentiment alone.  Game mechanics are pretty
similar...both are quest-driven games.  Both are trying to have very
content-rich, engaging worlds.  I couldn't tell you which one is doing it
better if I had a week to become an expert in both...we really don't know
until the games are under way which mechanics are superior. EQ2 has some
advantages in the area of character customization and a greater choice of
races/classes.  Not to mention the subtle but powerful advantage of the
voice-overs.  Hearing characters speak to you....well, it takes immersion
to the next level in a way you don't expect until you experience it.  

I'd like to say "may the best game win", but my honest prediction is that
both games will succeed enough to keep going strong, and the real winner
will be determined by how the games continue to be maintained and built
upon.
