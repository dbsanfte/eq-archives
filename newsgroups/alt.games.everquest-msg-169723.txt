I have done it, but again, its cost prohibitive to buy charged items in order to
exp kill, and going and hunting in a no exp zone in order to get a few of these
(they drop infrequently) really kills your total exp per hour figures too.

I haven't seen mobs that I can kill by melee fear kiting in POP in any
reasonable time, either, even if I had snare.

I did manage to kill an undead in POV solo this morning, by blind kiting; cast
flash of light, run ahead of mob, cast undead DOT, then back off till flash
breaks, repeat.  With the mob unsnared, this was nearly impossible to pull off,
they tend to run out of DOT range before it goes off.  Funny part was I also had
my pet on the thing, apparantly its aggro is low enough that the mob rarely
turns on it... but during the long portions of time while I was unable to stick
a DOT, my pet did hardly any noticable damage.

Every day I think about making a cleric of innorruuk, because they can get a
clicky snare item.   Not a good one, but ANY snare would make a huge difference
in my ability to solo.

Hmm, I think I'll break down and go do it right now.   Or I could play my bard,
probably that would be more fun.

I've spent at least half my clerical exp gathering life soloing... raids almost
never resulted in exp, until quite recently, so you could discount all that
time.
