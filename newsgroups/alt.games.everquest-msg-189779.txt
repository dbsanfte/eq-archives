I think a lot of the problem with this nerf is that it really does take away
the bility to do what a lot of enchanter have been doing since they got
their first charm spell. Soloing

At my level I now tend to get overlooked, groups prefer the slow of the
shaman it seems - so now I wont be able to solo either, well to be fair I
will be able to solo (with greatly added risk) but wont get any / much xp as
I wont be able to compete with the dps of the pet - a 6 second cast of 675
dmg doesnt amount to a whole lot of dmg :(
