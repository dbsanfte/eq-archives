Abysmal Sea is THE place to fish. With 206 fishing skill (200 plus the
modifier on the Brell Fishing Pole from the Fisherman's Companion), I make
1k per 10 stacks of bait. That takes me a little over an hour.

The fish are worth a lot per pound. Plus I get a Kitin's Key every two
stacks of bait. I give the keys to Kitin in return for an Essence of Troll
that I sell to an npc vendor for 57pp.

I don't remember if fishing is level limited. Even if it is, it's worth
doing. You can use the time between casts to skill up your spell skills.
