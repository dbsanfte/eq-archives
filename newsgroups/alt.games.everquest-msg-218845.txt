> > You have answered the wrong "why".

Oops, I finally understood your intent, Kaev, sorry.  "Why did SOE make it
so that a 52 cleric could be effective in a high-level group while a 52
warrior can't be effective?"

As to that... it all boils down to Complete Heal.  The original programmers
had no idea when they made this spell exactly how unbalancing it would be.
If they had to do it all over again, we wouldn't have a Complete Heal at all
and clerics would be a completely different class.

You have to understand, though, that clerics have had to pay the price for
this at well.  We can't tank.  We can't solo.  Our nukes are slow to cast
and drain our mana.  We get by far the worst of it from damage mitigation
that's given to all plate-wearing classes.  Clerics have been shackled to
Complete Heal and forever will be.  At least tanks get to run around and,
y'know, *do* stuff.  Clerics are escorted to a safe place and told to stand
still and cast CH.

So don't begrudge us the fact that we had it easier finding groups and
leveling up than other classes may have.  We pay for it in other ways.
