Multiple combines, we know it doesn't work to our cost. i.e. put in some
stacked items and combine by mistake.

Trade skills are a pain to raise level but hey that's the game and is not my
whine.

What I would like would be for Verant to implement some help for Trades
within Trades

An example

Wu's Armour.

Okay so you spent hours killing Crags for their silks, found an Enchanter to
do your vials, you now need the heady kiolas

1 bottle, 2 saps and one water click combine and then click into inventory.
6 clicks. Whole stack equals 120 clicks, that's a lot of mouse and
nerves/tendons abuse.

I would like it so that once you reach master (skill 100) for these kind of
item you can put in a stack of bottles, two stacks of sap and a stack of
water. click combine and it automatically runs a script against your skill
and hands you back on your pointer exactly what you would have combined
doing them singly.

I don't think it should apply to the actual final combine of items but for
the tannins, kiolas, bonings etc I think it would be a good thing
