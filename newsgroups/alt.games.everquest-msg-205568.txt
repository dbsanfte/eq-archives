IMO, for a good dungeon crawl you need a nice underused dungeon, some 
kind of stepped progression, and enough mobs to keep you occupied.

Dalnir in Warsliks Wood could be ok at your level, maybe a little too 
easy for a full group.

Kaesora is another good crawl, and doable with a good full group of 
level 40s.
You can also get one of the pieces for the key to THE best dungeon crawl 
in Norrath, Howling Stones.
