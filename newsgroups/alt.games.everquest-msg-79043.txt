Oh Biz, you're making my heart break... I'm nowhere near your level, of
course, but those are some of the reasons I play as well. Sometimes I go in
to get my summon skill up and just give the food/drink away... sometimes I
go buff people. This is probably why I'm only 18, 3 years after release!
It's probably why it took me so long to actually level to 18!!!

thanks for posting this.
