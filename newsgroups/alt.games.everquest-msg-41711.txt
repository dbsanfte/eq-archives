You can get your corpse yourself easily.

First method:

1. Get a map of Nektulos (www.eqatlas.com).

2. Create a Dark Elf character.

3. Log into your main character.  Type "/consent soandso", where
Soandso is the name of your Dark Elf.

4. Log into your Dark Elf.  Go find the corpse.  Target it and use the
/corpse command to drag it away from the guards.

Second method:

1. Get a map of Nektulos.

2. Create a Halfling rogue.

3. Log into main character and consent the rogue.

4. Log into the rogue, and go get the corpse, using hide and sneak so
the guards don't clobber you.

Halfling rogues are very good for this because Halflings get hide and
sneak as racial skills, so you have them at level 1 with a skill of
50.

The Dark Elf will be quicker (don't even bother trying to turn in your
guild note...as soon as you enter the world, just find the nearest
guard and whack him.  You'll respawn in Nektulos).  However, the rogue
can easily drag the corpse to the East Commons zone, which will be
more convenient for you.  A level 1 Dark Elf can have a lot of trouble
getting from the bridge to EC, because of the young kodiaks, shadow
wolves, and skeletons in that part of the zone.
