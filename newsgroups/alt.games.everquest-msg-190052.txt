Interesting - just today I noticed that I had lost 3 items from my
body. And I have recently been trading (and crashing!)  I have logging
on and have just checked the logs and there is no reference to me
selling them in error or anything.

They are not very important items - so I wont bother to follow up,
unless you are trying to build a case!

I will be interested to hear how you get on though - just in case it
is an important item next time (though I may be best leaving critical
stuff in bank when trading  until resolved).

Cheers
