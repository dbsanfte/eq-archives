Infinite amount, Qeynos has no direct involvement with Neriak. Killing
Qeynos Guards will improve Corrupt Guards and Bloodsabre factions it will
likely lower something difficult to improve, like Steel Warriors.

Killing Halflings will give you faction with Dread Guard Outer but I don't
know of any mobs/npcs that give you Dread Guard Inner or Dark Bargainer
Faction. There are quests to do these but you need to have a little faction
with them already to get a result from them.
