Ok sorry for all you experienced players who probably think this is a little
bit simple but I have always created a bst player for ease and the fact I
can play a little of nearly everything (casting, melee etc.).

When you begin you have a dagger, everywhere suggests put everything into
h2h so I have always followed this advice. With polished Ulak I manage to
cause damage of about 20 max per hit with a skill of 150 - I recently used a
new character and decided to put everything into piercing so with 20 skill
points at lvl 3 this I am already damaging at 6 max.

Are different skills better for causing damage than others if so in which
order. I appreciate the weapon and skill level contribute - the reason for
this is that I wish to get this new character as high as I can with maximum
speed without questing this time to about level 9, and at level 9 I have
found it more benificial to put training into magic skills for maximum
casting

Any help would be greatfully appreciated
