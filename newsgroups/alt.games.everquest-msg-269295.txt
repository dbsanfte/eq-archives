Harvesting is easy. Go to sunken city. Fish the nodes near the wharf (it's
required that you leap in the water, for no adequately explored reason, but
equally odly, you can fish whilst standing on a non-existent underwater
platform). Run a bit. Harvest roots and vegetables. Almost every node will
be one of these when you zone in. If you are lucky, noone else is foraging.
This is your chance! As the root/vegies nodes are removed, they are replaced
by useful nodes, like mineral and trapping and even collection nodes. Moths
sell for 3 sp each, so collections are a good money spinner, if you are
alone in the zone. I'm not sure about shards. Some people put the moths up
to sale for 3 gold but i don't know if they actually sell for that much.

However, should someone else be there, and they aren't fighting anything,
then wander around. See if they follow you. If so, you have picked up a
leech. That person is uninterested in harvesting, because that is work. They
want to reap the crop you have sown, and there's nothing you can do about
it, except leave and re-enter the zone (hoping to be in a different
instance) or try another zone (i find there are mob groups that can wipe me
out in the other harvesting tier 1 zones, although there's the odd mob i can
actually xp from solo).

If you are alone, i give it an hour or maybe 2 to get the skills up to 20
for everything except trapping, which seemed a little tougher. Mining and
the one for vegies went up to 40 when trapping was around 20, and 20 is all
you need for tier 2. Tier 2 is (for me) commonlands, which is vast,
interesting, rich, full of xp groups or places to solo, and it has great fun
things like the griffon ride... i just don't know if i can finish the shard
quests which now dominate my journal. :P
