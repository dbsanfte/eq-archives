Yellow is always 1 or 2 levels above you.  3 levels is red, always.

The amount that is blue changes with each level. (not sure what it is at
30).   Increasing from 3 levels below you at 5, to 15 levels below you at
60, then shrinking to about 10 levels below you at 65.


Also of note is that this *only* indicates level.   As you increase in
levels, white con's and above become significantly harder, relative to the
players that are killing it.  By level 30, you're not really meant to be
killing anything above a blue, unless you have a good group.  (Severe
twinkage and kiting strategies not withstanding)
