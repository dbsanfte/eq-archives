I had a brainfart last night and couldn't figure out how to sort tracking
by distance again after tracking by name.  I know /tracksort worked in EQ
but I tried it and /sort but they didn't seem to work. Anyone know? TIA

I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate. And I
can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never expect it.
