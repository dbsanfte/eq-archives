I just picked up a lovely Spell Haste IV piece in the cage portion of
the Saryrn fight last night.

It appears that the minimum duration is still 3.0 seconds - it just
also works on 61+ spells, which Spell Haste III did not when I was
wearing the Frostreaver cloak.

Now, BoR seems to work on every spell regardless of the level of the
spell - but there is also a minimum casting time of 3.0 seconds on
that as well.  At level 64, here is my usual raiding spell list (I
don't have the exact times with me, since I'm at work; I can merely
tell you if the spell is affected by BoR and my Spell Haste IV item).

Spell Slots: 
1. Complete Healing - Unaffected due to exemption
2. Supernal Elixir - Affected; original casting time 4.0 seconds
3. Supernal Remedy - Unaffected due to casting time (normal time is
1.8 seconds)
4. Condemnation (yeah, I know) - Affected; original casting time 6.5
seconds
5. Petrifying Earth - Unaffected due to casting time (2.5 seconds
normally)
6. Symbol of Kazad - Affected, original casting time 5.0 seconds
7. Ethereal Elixir - Affected, original casting time 5.0 seconds
8. Divine Aura - Unaffected by ANYTHING due to casting time, 1.0
seconds

I have four spells in my normal raiding bar that are affected by BoR
and Haste IV - I'll take it! :)

In grouping I have even more spells that are affected by these, so
again, I'll take them! :)

Note to those who would scoff at my spell bar - sometimes I have a
Stun (Tarnation) or a group heal (Word of Replenishment) substituted
for Condemnation - but nukes have saved me by dropping a mob that was
on it's last legs too often for me to not want SOMETHING offensive on
my bar.  Except in very specialized fights like AM in PoFire, I never
have DA and DB loaded - if one isn't enough, two surely won't be in
most cases.
