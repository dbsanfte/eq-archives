Hmm, my friend lucked out then, either he got a GM who spoke
Norwegian, or he got a GM who hadn't read the naming policy.
He petitioned his first name, Julenissen (Santa Claus in
Norwegian), and got it changed. Good thing, too, kinda hard
to beat THAT name for silliness.

Of course, GMs interpreting the various policies in a consistent
manner just about never happens anyway, so you might as well try
to petition it if you don't like it. Wouldn't hurt to do it during
off-peak hours though, no need to annoy GMs during peak.
