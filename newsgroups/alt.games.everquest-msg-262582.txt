Utterly and completely unjustified.  We could have toasted Japan in six
months and been done with the whole thing.  Hell, if we hadn't been making
the stirrings of war, the Japanese may never have tried that whole Pearl
Harbor thing.  Even they knew it could seriously backfire, though I'm sure
they never guessed how badly.

If you ever wonder about the power of the threat of nuclear weapons on the
collective psyche, here is a historically warrior-cultured country that was
so shocked by a military act that they rewrote their constitution to disarm
their military and make any practice of war unconstitutional.

Nuclear weapons are all the defensive military a country ever needs.  Who is
going to try an actual invasion if they know that their own country will
cease to exist behind them?
