Tested with lightstones awhile back and yes, they sell for more than the 
book does, so the warrior is losing money and experience.  The 
experience at 14 probably isn't too bad, either - I handed in about 6 at 
level .... 9 or so I think, and got over halfway to 10.  That was a nice 
surprise in addition to the money it made :)
