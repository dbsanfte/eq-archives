....Picking adventurer doesn't have any effect on how far you can
level your tradeskilling or how you do it. You get past level 3
exactly the same way. In fact, as far as I can tell (if you're
referring to the little dialog at the bank when you first get your
room and such), there's no effect on -anything- whether you pick
adventurer or crafter.
