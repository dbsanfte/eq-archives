You think Paladins have great AC?  If a class was picked entirely on AC on a
raid the Warrior would win over the Paladin any day (unless he was a really
poorly equiped warrior).  Paladins CAN tank, yes, but not as good as
warriors, so why would you want a Paladin at a raid rather than a warrior if
it comes down to tanking?  Or a cleric if it comes down to healing?

As you say, sure if you got good friends and all that or are a powergamer
then maybe you get to go along, but I will tell you it is not because you
have anymore use in a certain area than another class.  On a high end raid,
there is no type of ability that a Paladin has that cannot be better
performed by another class, be it damage output, tanking, healing, mob
control or whatever.  The only thing we come close to another class is mob
control, and that is only because we have the hitpoints to take the blows
while we are positioning it etc.  For that reason a Paladins main role at a
raid is usually to take care of adds, not a essential role, seeing as other
classes could do it, but while they are using their abilities to the full we
are left with doing what other classes don't have to because they have a
superior skill in a certain area.

Yes and sure if a Paladin is played well then he can be a great asset to a
raid, more so than a warrior who isn't played well (or cleric for that
matter).  That is not the point I am arguing.  The point is there is nothing
about us as a CLASS that makes us desired on high end raids.  If Thunder of
Karana was changed to say have a 30sec recast time, and perhaps upped the MR
check somewhat, then it would not be overpowering at all.  But apart from
not testing it properly to start with, Verant now do not even bother
thinking about the replacement effect, and give us a spell that is
worthless.

What Paladin in their right mind is going to waste their mana sieving the
mana of a mob at a ridiculous ratio (4:3 - enchanters is at least 2:1, and
does a lot more at once), that is going to have very little effect on its
overall mana pool of probably more than 10,000 (someone calculated this is
about what Vox has), instead of doing something more productive? (although
once again on high end raids perhaps this casting this spell would be more
productive - excuse the sarcasm).

Your point is a well played Paladin that knows his role is always welcome on
raids - I agree (well in most cases, there are some guilds that will not
recruit Paladins).  My point is our role is not all that great, nor is it
essential for our class to fill it.  If Paladins can tank good then why
don't we just take Paladins instead of Warriors?  No, I am not suggesting we
do.  I am suggesting that give us back a class defining skill like ToK was,
something that gives us a reason to be at a raid for more than just making
up numbers or because we have friends in high places - but because we are
needed.
