Fine.  Great.  But it IS and advantage for any caster that has it.

Ok.  What are we arguing about?  My original point in this is that
druids are one of the best solo classes out there.  One of they things
that makes them good is the fact that they get a lot of spells that
cover a broad range of abilities.  Now, taken individually, none of
the abilities in and of itself is all that great, but taken as a whole
it makes a druid class relatively easy to play.  But since druids have
such a nice bag of advantages, they have to have some disadvantages.
One of which is the fact that they aren't the best at anything, which
makes not strictly necessary in a lot of high end encounters.

Now take another class, say monks.  They get a nice grab bag of
abilities.  FD, mend, a metric buttload of damage dealing prowess.
They can solo decently, but they can't do a lot of things that make
the game a lot easier.  They make up for this by being very welcome in
groups.

Is one class better than the other?  Nope.  Do I enjoy one class more
than the other, sure.  That is NOT a slag against monks, just personal
preference.

Sure they do.  Gotta farm the phat lewt.  :-)
