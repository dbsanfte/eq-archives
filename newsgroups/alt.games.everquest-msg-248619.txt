Very odd. I'd set up in the bazaar yesterday morning before work, went home
at lunch, was still connected. Came back to work, and when I got home almost
5 hours later, I was still connected. Played all evening, didn't get
disconnected once. Set up in bazaar before going to bed, still connected
this morning (although the servers came down about 20 minutes after I got up
this morning).
