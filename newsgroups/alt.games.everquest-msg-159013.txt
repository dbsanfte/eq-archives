I'm dubious to that faction, but i was told Yvolcarn and azureake would jump
in if you attack wyverns? Can a monk/druid combo fight wyverns or are they
kite-only mobs? If Yvolcarn and azureake don't invite themselves to the
party, it could be fun, far less laggy than jaggedpine, but i want to spend
a while there first, and then maybe cobalt scar (on that provision!)

Thanks for the advice.
