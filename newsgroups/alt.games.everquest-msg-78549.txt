I do the same thing.  I was playing an old arcade game on MAME with my 
older brother when some younger kids came up behind us and were like "Oh, 
that's a game like was on the Super Nintendo."  We just laughed and 
thought, "Ain't nothing wrong with that.  It's more fun than some of 
those 3D games you play today."
