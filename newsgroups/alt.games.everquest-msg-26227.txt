Only problem I see is that every time I swim up against the zone in FV, it
drops me under the world, and pops me into the safe spot on land not far
from the bridge to FV.  I use this all the time to get to FV from the ship
rather than wait the interminable amount of time for the ship to start
moving after zoning.  If this happened, not sure where you would end up with
autorun on.
