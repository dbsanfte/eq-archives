This is correct other than the gender. ;)

No clue about this one.  It makes sense though as when we used to
kill Doomshade it was via someone spotting the DMs were chanting in
zone which suggests they do it more than once per spawn.

This is correct.

I'm guessing that when you kill Doomshade the timer resets and she's
not triggerable again for 3/7/insert_actual_spawn_time_here days?
