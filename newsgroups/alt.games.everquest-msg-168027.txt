Well actually Statue is easier than Vindi for a lot of reasons, but ok.

Vaniki isnt a cov faction mob (or even a dragon).
Zland is also the one first brood who doesn't give a negative CoV faction
hit

Stay in PoF and PoH the rest of your life then.  Don't ever look ahead and
risk a few deaths to progress as a guild.

JaZZ's guild killds Trak and VS, and other random epic mobs.  Killing those
means you can kill Velk (who drops one of the best wizzy robes, period..).
Dropping velk implies you can kill Vaniki and Bob.

Dropping velketor easily (farming him) means your ready for Vindi.

Dropping vindi easily (farming him) means your ready for Zlandi.

And so on and so forth.
