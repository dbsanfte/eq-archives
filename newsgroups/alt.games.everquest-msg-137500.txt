Sure there can.  It's called 'hate crime legislation'.  Usually, once a 
law is passed, I'd consider t legitimate, if it isn't blatantly 
unconstitutional.

Yes, exactly.

}Considering that all cases of first degree
}murder have motives, how can we say that one is "worse" than another?

Like this:  "one is worse than the other".  It's no different, really, 
from the distinction between murder and manslaughter.

}If you can declare a "hate crime," then we're not handing out stiff enough
}sentences to begin with.

Well, that's as may be.  But it seems to have successfully been declared 
anyway.
