From the shadows, the mysterious Beebo
<beeboYOURHEADFROMYOURASS@email.com> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

You have no right to play in any privately controlled game you want.
That is a privilege given to you by the people running it. They can
ban you from playing for whatever reason they want, including no
reason at all, as long as they're not discriminating based on race,
religion, etc, and the burden of proof for that is on the guy
complaining.

I won't touch the rest of the chaos in this thread with a ten foot
pole, but I thought I'd address that little tidbit. You do not have
any right to play Sony's games. It's a privilege afforded you by a
private company, just like riding a ferris wheel, going to a hockey
game, buying a game in a computer store, etc. You break the rules they
set forth (being too short for the ferris wheel, smoking in the arena,
drinking soft drinks around the computers, none of which is illegal),
they'll ban you. Breaking the rules isn't illegal (that's what's meant
when people say when they mention the EULA is not a legally binding
contract), but neither is banning you. And the only legal precedent
set so far in mmorpgdom supported this, as Tim mentioned.
