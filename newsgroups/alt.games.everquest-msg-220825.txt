That might come down to my lack of dex at this level. When I try
working with my swarmcaller, what usually seems to happen is that I'll
wait half the fight for it to proc before switching it out. ... by
that time the mob would be dead if I'd used a regular weapon <g>. 

I was eyeing a wavecrasher in the bazaar last night, slow might not be
as good but at least I could keep up DPS while using it.
