Would never happen on Prexus.

All 3 elemental guilds are pretty reputable - you can be certain a ninja
would never get in any of these.
Id even extend that to the top 6 guilds - all have pretty solid recruit
systems to stop assholes like this getting in.

If you have a bad rep on Prexus, the highest guild who would take you in, is
currently dipping into nToV... killing broods, Vindi... etc.  Thats a long
long way from Elementals (or even AoW/Agnarr/Bert for the top 5ish)
