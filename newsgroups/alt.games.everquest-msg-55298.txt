As a pally, I pull with the cheapest arrows I can find (1 silver per arrow)
because:
- I can easily use 50-100 arrows if I am pulling for a long time and I can't
afford expensive arrows for that
- I usually have SoW when pulling and most of the time, it makes me run
faster (or at least at same speed) than the pulled mob. So range is not so
much a concern.

It is a good idea to use arrows for pulling but don't waste your plats in
it! Keep them to upgrade your equipment...
