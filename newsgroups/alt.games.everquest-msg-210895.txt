While you can kill mobs via those methods, far and away your most productive way
of soloing is something I like to call "lets you and he fight", charming mobs
and using them as pets, or better yet disposable pets (kill target, then break
charm and kill nearly dead former pet) or better still swarm kiting (have pet
battling several of his buddies, breaking charm and killing as with the
disposable plan, then picking next mob out of the pack to get chewed up again)

Can't do any of that though at 12 or 18...
