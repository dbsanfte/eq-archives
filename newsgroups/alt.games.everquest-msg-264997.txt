For the record, this seems to be an issue primarily for those using the 6800 
series (and then mostly with Ultras and not GTs). At least, that's my read 
of the various posts. The problem is described as having to do with the 
interaction of the nVidia chipset and the EQ2 shadows code, and the 
recommendation of the devs is to turn shadows OFF while they are sorting out 
the problem with nVidia. I've had better performance since doing this, but 
I'm not convinced this is the sole reason because overall graphic 
performance is still better on my ATI board, which can't be right.

And of course, not everyone is having the problem (which complicates finding 
and fixing it).
