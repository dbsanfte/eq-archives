My rogue just hit 24, I'm pretty happy and enjoy playing the class.  I've
been in highhold / highkeep quite a bit lately, decent xp though it can be
tough getting in a group as the goblin area is so small and always busy....
also waiting on the spawns sucks to no end.

That being said, I decided to head back to my home area and check out the
dungeon of Najena (sp?)  It was pretty interesting, I poked around a bit
hidden/sneak until I noticed to tentacle terrors; I didn't want to push my
luck so I went back to the entrance.  This zone was completely dead, as
it -- I was the only one in the whole zone.  If there are XP bonuses now in
dungeons, why are these things still so under populated?  Surely there have
to be better places for players in their early/mid 20's than bumbling around
in Oasis.  Are most dungeons in the original lands dead?

Secondly -- I'm not sure how many of you have played a rogue, but I was
offended to a large degree the other day.  In highkeep fighting goblins, a
player in the party sent me a tell (after looting a mob) saying "You're a
very good pick pocket"  WTF!??!!  I almost lost it and booted her right
there.  I have *NEVER* used pick pocket on the mobs I encounter while
grouped.. in fact, my PP skill is probably still below (10) -- why should I
even work on it?
