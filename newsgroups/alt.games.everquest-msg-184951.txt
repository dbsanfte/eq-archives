Bzzzzt!  You are missing out on what can make the most fundamental
difference in both the taste and the alcohol content of mead by throwing
that Fleishmann's yeast crap in there. Spend the extra dollar and get
real yeast. If you like high octane mead, go with a good champagne
yeast. (Can result in mead that's close to 20% alcohol by volume. I've
made a bunch of it.) If you prefer the lower a.b.v. stuff you can get
any of the other types, like red wine yeast, flor sherry yeast, etc.
etc.  

We have twenty five gallons of mead in the basement aging at the moment
which was made in five different five gallon carboys. Each one used the
same water, the same batch of honey, everything identical except a
different yeast was used for each. Now it's a couple years old, and I
can tell you, each of the five is an entirely different drink easily
told from the others by the most inexperienced taster.
