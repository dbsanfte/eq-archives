Having suffered some deaths on mid level characters lately due to idiots
training high level monsters to the zone line, I have to say in almost every
case SoW is *NOT* the best solution.

I have never asked for a SoW for a corpse run. A SoW is inappropriate in a
lot of cases. To me, it<Selo's too> can often mean "I'm an idiot and I plan
on running in a straight line through every monster for 3 zones and the
train will be everyone elses problem."

It would be much better to be traveling invisible in almost every case.
There is a problem with invisibilty spells not lasting long enough, but that
is something VI should take care of. Do something like tie the duration of
invisibility to the weight you are carrying. Monks of couse would get the
bonus more often during regular game play, but really, who cares?

The only exception is undead and high level monsters that see through
invisibility, and once again if VI changed the code to allow for low weight
being carried => increased effectiveness, it wouldn't be a problem.

The current situation is you need a 9+ Shammy<who are out on the edges of
the game world> or a Druid that is at least level 14 that is standing around
your bind point when you happen to die. The situation I am talking about
would mean a level 4 enc or 5 druid or 8 magician would be added to the list
of people able to help you with corpse recovery.

I have noticed a lot of uninformed players, I am assuming 12 year old types,
that don't quite have our handle on the game. They see people yelling for
SoW's for corpse runs and think that is the best way to do one. Even simple
things that we take for granted like draging your corpse to a safe area,
they just don't get. Nothing funny then to have some poor kid you have just
SoW'd and camo'd try to loot his corpse at the feet of the mob that had just
killed him.

At some point it does become our responsibilty to educate them. It can be as
simple as changing "Need SoW for corpse run" to "Need SoW and/or camo for
corpse run".

The added benefit for me is I will die a bit less due to griffon and hill
giant trains if people are traveling invis.
