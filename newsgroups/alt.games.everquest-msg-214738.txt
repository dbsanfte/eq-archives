A few posts about it not being the best item.. I have to say I love it, and
it was worth every plat I paid for it.  I agree it doesn't have a great
damage to casting time ratio.. but it's manaless...  267 damage every 10
seconds for.. well, ever.  Go on a raid, a mob that takes 3 minutes to
kill.. chain nuke, 6 casts a minute, 3 minutes, 18 casts at 267 damage a
cast, 4,806 damage(.. minus a resist or two, maybe that's still a nice
number) (I don't get resisted that often with it.. even against ice giant).
Ok, you could be cannibalizing during this time.. true, but that costs you
health and it costs somebodies mana to heal you or keep regen on you, or a
long time to regen naturally.  Plus, it just makes things easier.  Killing
giants in Rathe.. cast a pet, sic the pet, nuke to death.  Because of the
long casting time, it gives the mob time to 'forget' about you, so you don't
piss it off to come after you as much.

Just my two cp.
