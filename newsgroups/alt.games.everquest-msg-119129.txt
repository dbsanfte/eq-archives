It doesn't matter that it's not a public channel. The rules don't
specify that it's only disallowed in public chats. (Incidently,
technically /gu is public. "private" channels would be tells).

Anyway, I know of people petitioning language in /gu but not reporting
and getting the response that nothing can be done because no /report
was submitted. (The petition coming shortly after the rampaging idiot
was booted from the guild)

All that proves is that they can log guildchat. They might have been
prompted to "turn on" logging (if the logging isn't full time active)
by the fact that it was such a major first-time event they were
attempting.
