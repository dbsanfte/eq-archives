And, if every person removed a few bricks, there wouldn't be any left to
drop.

There is actually a good argument for at the very least reducing meat
consumption significantly.  It requires far more in the way of crops being
farmed in order to feed animals to be slaughtered for our consumption than
is required to raise crops simply for our direct consumption.  Given this,
it would be possible to actually reduce the amount of farming, and still
produce the same amount of food for direct human consumption.  There is also
the health issue, it is, in general, healthier to eat a primarilly
vegetarian diet.  All that being said, I'm a hypocrite, I eat meat, and I
enjoy it, however, I do know that there are perfectly valid arguments for
why being vegetarian is a good thing.

The other consideration, aside from whether  it's a good idea to be
vegetarian or not, if it makes him happy, why do you care?  It's not like
he's trying to force you to stop eating meat or drive your car or anything.
He made his choices for his reasons, you have made yours.
