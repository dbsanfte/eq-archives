Might be tricky coordinating with you what with you being in the UK, but, 
if I am available when you want to give it a shot, I can probably snag a 
few people to help out, being as you are on the same server.

I will say that after doing it last night I would be comfortable doing it 
with a smaller group than I had.  Be sure to bring along an enchanter, or 
an FDer, as you will need to aggro the General at times to stop him for a 
bit, then dump the aggro.  The information on eqtraders seemed to be 
accurate regarding what the waves consist of, their rootability, and 
mezzability.  Wolves were all mezzable, giants were all rootable.

We had two druids to kite the extras while we killed two at a time.  A 
couple of rangers to harmony and/or kill mobs pathing through (druids 
would have worked fine for that), and to add DPS vs the mobs in the 
waves.  One cleric, one enchanter, and a few assorted other classes, 
wizard, necro, shaman(me), monk, paladin and warrior as the MA and OT.
