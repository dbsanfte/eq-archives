you would think that after a year of my playing and patching
and my buying of new expansions that sooner or later the 
damned game would load without the cursor sticking.  yeah, i 
keep the mouse moving like a madman, but tonight, 5 times the
cursor is stuck in the left top corner of the character selection
screen.

so do you all just live with this, or is it just a few that have    	
the problem and why are we having it?


sure, i can go for a week with it never sticking.

sorry just felt like bothering the rest of you with "my" problem.
