This is NOT a good twink weapon, with a 45 delay and a damage cap of 20 below 10 it
is like having a 10/45, which is why a Runed Totem or Staff of Observers is a much
better twink weapon. Even with the 10-20 damage cap of 30 the Icegrinder is worse,
but post 20, definatly a nice weapon.

Same thing applies with 2HS, Axe of Iron Back is a wonderful twink 2HS, much faster
than some of your better weapons.
