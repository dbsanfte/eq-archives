Only problem was that everybody in the Warrens was 14+ besides me  (this was
pre-Stonebrunt)

This is why my druid wears a bracer of the hidden (insta cast right click
see invis, must be worn to use), saves a spell slot and only costs 1 wisdom
(replaces a thork bracer), which I've got 198 more of anyways (Hooray for
Eboots!).  Really useful to spam the hell out of annoyances, and keep a crap
buff up for dispells (not that I hardly ever get dispelled at level 32), as
well as placating the "buff plz" people, and I throw a see invis in with
every sow I toss out.

I've got a DE cleric at level 3 in nek, I basically created her to demo the
Etched Iron armor from Stonebrunt, It'd work a lot better if I could get the
BP/legs, as it is she just has DARK reddish/black arms/wrist/gloves, some
cheezy knockoff out of the Warrens of the Black Iron/Alloy Crown out of
Runnyeye and leather BP/legs.

Place still sucks though, too easy to get lost with no path to Neriak, and
even Ultravision can't help with the darkness of the forest.  (and yet my
wood elf druid can see there fine with infravision, WTF?)

As far as I've played an Iksar, the exp penalty isn't that bad, and with the
regen, necro's can get exp a whole lot faster because they can keep Lich up
longer and have more mana.  And as for sub-par int, there's a metric assload
of +int stuff out there, 200+ int is a whole lot easier than 200+ wis, my
level 12 Erudite necro has 168 or so int (base 140), and about 50 +mana, my
level 32 druid has 198 wis and about 100 +mana, and the necro isn't even
overly twinked, just a ring of frost and obsidian bead hoop I looted with my
druid, for all of 6 int and 10 mana, at level 12 my druid didn't even have
125 wis (base 115) and +mana items were a pipe dream, although, granted, I
did loot about 12 wis and 40 mana off the Halloween GM events, while my
necro sat in the freezer (should've gotten stuff for him too, oh well)

I know Half-elves can't be necros  =P  but a half-elf necro would be really
cool
