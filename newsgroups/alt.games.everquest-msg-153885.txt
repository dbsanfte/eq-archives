    And they don't raid the targets that make such obsession mandatory, so
their opinion means squat. Because they don't have to deal with the
consequences of their opinions, like key people lagging out at crucial times
because you've taken a dozen more people along than you should have.

    This is a misunderstanding on your part. I'm not calling these players
jackasses. Rather, I'm pointing out that your solution to the problem -
"take any old healer that's lying around with you" - won't work, and won't
be done. We already take people who are playing "redundant" characters and,
if we need clerics, make them play clerics. And we're one of the most casual
uberguilds you're going to find on any server. The other raiding guilds,
even on our server, are a LOT more strict about who gets recruited and who
goes on raids.

    Nobody likes losing over and over. They end up giving up, or making the
adjustments needed to win. The people in uberguilds all have that basic
drive - to see all there is to see, and win at it.

    Again, you've misunderstood. I'm using the term "jackass" in the same
way I'd use "any old". I'm not implying that druids are jackasses. /sigh
