They were up earlier, logged off for a few hours due to a friend coming 
over (i know, RL is a scary concept, but happens once in a while), and 
now it seems down. If i finally manage to get through login screen all 
servers are listed as up, but tried both Veeshan and AB (am european), 
no responses from either the last 20 min. No info on the network status 
pages yet, and chat too crowded to get into, get kicked back to login 
screen.
Oh well, they got 3 hours before i have to attend a EQ wedding :)
