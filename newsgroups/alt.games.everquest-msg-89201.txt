If you get a bard, you'll need a tank... monk is not a tank... just ask one.

Druid makes most sense there to me, SoW, Snare, DD, Ports, HEALING. Although
as I mentioned last time you asked, Druid healing has several levels where
it just does not cut it. Example, at level 18 the druid can only heal for 29
points, this is at a level most tanks will have 400-500 hp, so if your tank
gets down to half (say 250hp) it will take 9 heals to get him back to full.
In comparison, at 18th Clerics can heal for roughly 80 points a heal. Tank
is back to full in 3 casts. At 19th druid gets healing for 80 points, but
does not get another healing spell until 29th. At 19th Clerics can heal for
260 or so. This problem repeats itself every few levels. Your spell is ok
for you to be healer only 3-4 levels at a time.

Having said this, I would still go with druid. Having a bard will be a great
asset. more mana for the druid (after 20th) more health for the tank between
fights (and a bit during). Maybe go with paladin as your tank for extra
healing and LoH.
