Finally got it to work.  Yes, I remember this from the awards.  Asked
in the newsgroup at the time if anyone else had seen it.

One extra question, how do I get it to save a copy of the movie to my
hard drive?  So far, all it'll do is play; I can't seem to get it to
save a copy, and can't find the file in my temporary internet storage.
