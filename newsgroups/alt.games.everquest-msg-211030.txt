Get real... if Windows came with a manual that said to press the "Stop" 
button to bring up the Stop Menu, and then under "proggies" right click 
"utilities" to bring up the calculator. Would you say ... "Learn how the 
system works and stop taking everything it says literally?" or would you 
say Microsoft needs to get its act together and write a manual that 
reflects the actual process.

The conning system 'works', yes, provided you *know* what it *really* 
means. But players shouldn't need a hundred hours of experience and/or 
an outside explanation to correctly interpret the simple phrase: "You 
would probably win this fight."
