Yeah I don't get it either. Looking at those names though they seem to
be in the RP vein, kind of a problem really that a person could come
up with a nonsensical name like Remf which would actually seem fairly
fitting yet it must be some kind of an acroynm for something I guess
that I am not familiar with so verant would change it? Really such a
policy is a bit too anal for me. I could see like changing someone
name if it was the "F" or "C" word or something obvious but possibly
accidental acronyms or obscure historical figures is getting pretty
ridiculous. The obscure historical figure thing actually happened
where some guy picked an rpg sounding name out of thin air and a head
GM on the server he was on changed it, when asked why the GM said
something like "As I am sure you well know, so stop pretending you
don't, that name is what one of Genghis Khans lieutenants went by." ,
or something nutty like that.
