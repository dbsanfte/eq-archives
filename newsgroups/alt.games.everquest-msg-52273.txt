Hello all.  Thanks for the information so far.  I have changed the router
out for an SMC Barricade and I am still having the problem.  I made the
machine I am playing on the DMZ host so it is fully exposed.  I am going to
check to see if maybe Bellsouth is blocking incoming ports in the high range
for wierd reason.  If anyone has any other ideas of things to look at please
let know.
