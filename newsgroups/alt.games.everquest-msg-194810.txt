It's not that rough, I have made the run numerous times in the dead of 
night with low level characters (level 1 and up).  I have died twice (once 
at level 15ish, and once at 26ish), but, that is the exception, not the 
norm.  The mobs generally don't path high up on the walls, unless someone 
pulled one there.
