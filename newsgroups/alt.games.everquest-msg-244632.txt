The guild policies may be questionably draconian. If the raid guild 
*gives* you time off, and you choose to enjoy that time off playing 
tennis at the park the guild can't say boo about it if you don't show up 
for an unannounced raid. If you decide to take that time off playing a 
LDoN then the guild *must* respect that to all intents and purposes you 
are *NOT* available. A guild that doesn't isn't worth being in.

No. The group should not have to put up with that kind of crap. If you 
are in a hardcore raid guild. Ask your guild in advance if you have time 
for a LDoN. If they say yes, then its settled. They have committed to 
living without you for an hour+... you might as well be offline playing 
tennis. If they say no: don't go on a LDoN there is plenty of other 
stuff to do.

There should be no reason to leave w/o warining for a raid. Ever.

And possibly the entire guild, if they're the self absorbed idiots.
