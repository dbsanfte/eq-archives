Does make me wonder why they are considered "popular" members of the
group?

Here is actually what I said in that post:

Oh give it a rest .... you and some others seem to insist on this
ridiculous
convention in this particular newsgroup (I have not met another
newsgroup
that is as rabid about this practice)... since you are not moderators
just
killfile the top posters rather than seeming like the little boys you
appear
to be.

When I posted almost a year ago a number of references on this matter
about
top posting and the fact that it did adhere to "Netiquette" some of you
were
reduced to vitriol and abuse. Just let the top posters alone or ignore
them
if it offends your sensibilities.

I used Lance's post to point out the futility of abusing top posters a
la Bizbee et al.  I agree he is a lovely guy. In the first paragraph I
was talking to Lance and the second to the newsgroup in general.

He actually didn't post for 2 days.

I have not lied .. no one has put up a set of statistics to shoot it
down as a lie.  Some have visited the groups and posted their opinions
not statistics.  Some even supported me by saying they were top posting
groups, Wharf Rat is one that comes to mind and I am sure there were
others.

Because of his non-archving I can only go on my memory where he joined
Sisson in his abuse.

Gratuitous? ... true is the word.

I return to my first answer in this post.  Why are Sisson, Bizbee and
DarkTyger considered to be popular in this group.  They invariably have
nothing to contribute except vitriol.  Dan Days expose of Bizbee is
perhaps the best example of detect work I have seen on this particular
character.

How and why does this group consider any of these three to be "popular"?

I do not believe I was rude to Lance wouldn't even call it a flame
really. The whole lot of flames came after I posted my list of
newsgroups not after this post.

This is not a democracy it is newsnet ... if it was a democracy George
Bush would have sent in the special forces to take out Bizbee, Sisson
and Dark Tyger.

The one about Bizbee is illustrative of his abusive nature. which also
extends to top posting

No one else posted data, or analised mine that I am aware of  .. I was
the only one.

Hard call with his "no archive" but I have pointed out Dan Day's list
above.

Bizbee adds nothing but abuse and vitriol to this newsgroup I am still
amazed that you consider him to be popular (jaw is still dropped to the
floor).  I am more amused by his target's response which is mostly in
line with my thoughts on him.  You may also note that although he says
he is not the author he does not quote a source tich tich.

With a one line response to one part of a clearly defined thread I have
no problems with top posting .. at that time I was a top poster ... I
am not now unless I am in a hurry.

Bad manners hmmm ... I think not vitriol against the abusers likely ..
bad manners ... why because I defend my self from wrong slurs?

I pointed out in an answer above that the "bottom poster being caned"
was the only one I had ever seen taken to task in these NGs.  Caning
does not have to involve abuse.  In this particular post, if IIRC, the
worst it came to was "who do you think you are telling where I can and
cannot post" ... a cane in my view but not abusive.

And if it had been a bottom poster getting caned I would have said the
same thing.  My view is that there are bigger fish to fry in the sea.
If you do not like seeing top posting kill-file Just like Annie does.
Yes the onus is on the reader to do so but it is the reader's
sensibilities that are offended .. simple solution .. kill file.

Leave them alone and kill-file I think work together ... I find that
totally logical if it fits.

Please tell me where I have backed down on any statements I have made
apart from the one that Ben Sisson had switched off his achiving .. I
apologised on that.

Neither and "cheap shots" are the words.

I will leave you with Dan Harmon's view on top posting just for
interest.  I have not seen Dan posting for a long time but he was a
regular here.
