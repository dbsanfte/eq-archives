And hell levels could never be fixed, remember?

If you leave the box of your experience to date behind and think of the
problem within the confines of the Planes ~only~ (as was suggested in an
earlier post), the problem is managable.  Not only is it managable given the
existing parameters of Norrath, but you could even argue that it may not
exist at all.

The Planes are new territory ... they can be whatever they need to be to
suit the circumstances of the designer's ideas.  Given that, and ~if~ you
confine those changes to the Planes only, the 60 cap no longer needs to
exist.  Again, this assumes that that no character higher than lvl 60 be
allowed on Norrath or Luclin without being stripped of the powers they have
attained in the Planes.

Agreed.  My thinking, though, is that they have the opportunity to do
something major here, and when you consider the events of the past week they
seem to be setting it up.  I'm probably all wet.

But what if I'm not. :-)
