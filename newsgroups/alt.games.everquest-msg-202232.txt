<<<Hi,

My name is Elhea, Little wizzie erudite lvl 18 on antonius Bayle server.
Today, I would be lucky because I can log in EQ. But, 2 Week Ago, I was LD
in Paludal, and due to missing time, I couldn't log before today.And what is
my surprise when I arrived on Select character screen ! I was naked !!! :-(
I'll try to contact GM to explain this but they don't want to know anything
:-( I know that's a mistake not to go back after LD, but I'm newby in EQ,
and don't know corpse stay during a fixed time lootable ! After, corpse
disapear !

My question is this one : Anyone could tell me how to find a not bad
equipment for so few money ?

thx for advance

Elhea the unlucky wizzyGirl>>>>

I hate it when that happens but the good news for you is that you are a caster.
 If this happens and you are a melee(fighter) you are in big trouble but as a
caster, and especially as an Erudite Wizzy, you don't really need gear that
badly to survive.  If you're soloing you're gonna be rooting and shooting
anyway and you won't need any gear to survive that.  You'll have enough mana
naked to survive and just keep saving your money.  In groups the bad guys
should rarely be touching you anyway or you're nuking too much.  I know it
seems horrible now, but just keep saving your money.  Won't take long to
replace everything you've lost and you'll soon have much better stuff anyway. 
Good Luck!!
