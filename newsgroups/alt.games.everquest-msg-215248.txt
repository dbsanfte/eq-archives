I never found one in Cabilis, but did in PoK as Jennai mentioned.

HeHe you were almost correct! I got my corpse and it was right where I
thought it was. For the life of me I cannot figure out how I missed it
when looking the first time. I knew it was on a point of land close to
the water and across from the path back to Cabilis, I'm sure I ran past
it several times, but didn't see it the first time and luck, bad,
finally caught up with me. I positioned myself right near the fallen
Iksar statue, where my second corpse should have been, but the rod
pointed me towards the first corpse. I'm quite happy Iksars can swim
well as the Swamp has a lot of water as swamps often do! I looted the
first corpse, then used the rod again to find the second one. I got a
message that I had no more corpses in the zone. Do corpses have to be
looted in reverse order? The rod I found cost me around 7pp and some
gold and I used 2 charges. I'll have to send Gwydon over to Butcherblock
again and hunt some Goblins. I like 3-4pp and often double that for some
kills!

Nice trick, noted!

I'll make a hotkey as soon as I log in today! Have the entire day off! I
don't know why SOE put these spawns within those higher level creatures.
It certainly makes it nearly impossible to complete the quest while they
still give experience. I spoke to a SK after my corpse run, and he was
having the same problem. He needed Froglok Raiders. A lot of them
apparently! They roam near the obelisk, also among very red roamers. He
had far worse luck than myself, as he lost a level in the process of
collecting less than half of the needed items for the SK quest. I need 4
bucklers, but SK's need 10, if memory serves correct, pages or something
similar. My guess is that SOE's intent in placing newbie quest creatures
among reds is to teach you skills you will need later. Time will tell as
I seem to have hit a wall at 18 with my characters.

As I said, I thought I knew where it was, even tried noting it on a map
as I died, to no avail. I HAD to have run past it several times!

All good advice! Thanks for taking the time to spell it out!!
