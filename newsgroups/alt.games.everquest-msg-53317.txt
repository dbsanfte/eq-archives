1)   Twice now, while root/Dotting a mob to death, when the root wore
off close to its death and I stood up to recast root if needed, the
mob was no longer in front of me.  I managed to find one with
tracking, but the other I could not though I did eventually get the
message that ensnare wore off.  

2)  I went to Permafrost to try and obtain the mammoth hide cloak.  No
one was there late last night, and I was too tired to try for a
potentially long boring camp. So I camped by the boulder.  I logged
back in this morning and someone else was there.  I camped.  I logged
in just a while ago and my position had changed, close to coordinates
0, 0 near the entrance to Permafrost.
