I'm not suggesting it, I'm saying it flat out.  I personally know of
several shaman, enchanters, and clerics that so vastly prefer knights
as tanks in PoP that they will happily pass over a warrior.  A guildie
of mine recently shelved his 55 warrior because of the difficulty he
had finding groups.  Granted, he's a insomniac like I am, so you do
have to take into account that it's not all that easy to find groups
at 3am, but still, he did alright for the other 55 levels.
