I agree with everything you said here. My point is that, whether the 
cleric agrees or not, if a group member feels they need, or merely want, 
a particular buff, and...

...they are willing to pay for the components
    	- and -
...mana is not an issue

...then the cleric would just be childish to deny them. To do so would be 
imposing their own opinions on others for no reason other than the fact 
that "they're *your* buffs, by god".

Then again, I do very well agree that mana is seldome *not* an issue.
