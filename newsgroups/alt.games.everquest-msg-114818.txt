    Heh. The thing is, I shouldn't be at 4168 then. Prior to the patch, my
max HPs was 4108. After the patch, I got 30 HPs from my Grieg boots being
upgraded, and I equipped Centi Toe Stew (only changes). Equipping the stew
gives me 30 HPs to my max possible, and 60 HPs to my current total from what
I can tell.
