I am not rich. infact my computer is the only thing I have that is nice, I
actually took an injury (minor) at work and stayed with it despite how
uncomfortable it was, just to save up. it wasnt easy but I have a nice

start saving up too maybe you can afford something nice that you've been
wanting.
