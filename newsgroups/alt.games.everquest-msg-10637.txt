Either they can't, or they can and don't want to. Sometimes they say one,

No argument there. It will be nice when we have more options in online

any good when they do come out? Hell if I know.)

> BTW did you ever send a feedback or an email to Verant about this

Of course. "In this zone on this server at these coordinates at this time,
this happened etc. etc."
It's important to provide specific details when filing a bug report.
