This is your quote;
"Roleplaying is acting."

This is Raph's quote;
"They don't have any "role-acting" which is what a
lot of people tend to think of as "roleplaying."

Read Raph's 4 definitions and see which one is the
only one to mention acting. 

Acting, or lack thereof, was central to the whole
discussion.

And now, you wish to extend the definition to
anyone who plays Pacman, presumably.

Why?

It reinforces the point, it doesn't detract from
it.
