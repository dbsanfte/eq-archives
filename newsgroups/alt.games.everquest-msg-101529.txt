>>> I'm sure if he ever read anything in this ng,  <<<

I'd be content with him reading the ng before posting ... maybe then he

A: we already know about price increase
B: we don't care

Sometimes I wonder if anyone reads the ng before posting, or do they just
hit "New Post" as soon as they log on.
