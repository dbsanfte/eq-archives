HaHa, I was in oasis with my lvl 20 ranger, and this 16th lvl guy starts harassing me and stealing my kills with his group, so what do I do? I track down an SG and train it to them, and damn it, I died, but it's not like I didn't know it would happen, but it pisses me off just the same, no way to be happy about it, ecept that he and his whole group died.
