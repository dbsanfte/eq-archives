From the shadows, the mysterious Annie Benson-Lennaman
<anniebenlen@stopthevoices.yahoo.com> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

>     As the cleric, I cannot just wander away to catch a bird. Lenny types out
>"Gotta go, bird in the house!" and tries to catch it. The bird, predictably,
>doesn't appreciate that and flies off in the direction of another curtain
>rod.... this one on the far side of the hot tub. Lenny takes off after it..
>along with 4 of our 5 cats.

At my family's home we would have just let the cats take care of it.
They look so relaxed and calm when they're lazying about but man when
