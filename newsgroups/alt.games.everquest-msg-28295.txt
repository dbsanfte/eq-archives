Greetings,

I am using an ISDN connection from my home now.

My solution may be a bit different than you are envisioning...I am using a
3com IQ modem for my system.  Instead of "sharing" the isdn through my
machine, I ran a phone line from my wifes machine's 56k analog modem to the
second port on the ISDN modem.  I get 64k (57k or whatever the actual
connection rate is) via the ISDN to my machine and typically get 53-56k on
the analog for the other system.  This is attributible to the benefits of
using a digital line as the source for the analog dialup.  I have no
problems configuring both machines to use anything and if my machine is off,
the other system can still dial out.

The techies out here may have other solutions, but this setup has been very
reliant for me.

Take care.
