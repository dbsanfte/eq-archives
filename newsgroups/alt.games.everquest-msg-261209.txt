Guilty!  running ME and have the eternal night problem.  the online
techie decided that having "agp texture acceleration not found"
under the display tab in dxdiag was the problem.  I'm trying to fix
this problem.  From what I've been told, I need to make sure my bios
is updated and then update my agp driver.  Since I've got an asus MB
everyone suggest an intel driver utility.  
What bother me about this is it worked before the OoW release.  
Oh well.
