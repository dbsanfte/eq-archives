Not that I disagree with you fundamentally(this time), Dennis, but come to
Central Ohio some spring break and tell that to the folks in the River
Valley Local School District, who after a significant rise in rare cancers
and blood and bone-related diseases a year or two back, found that an area
directly adjacent to River Valley High School had been used to dispose of
radioactive waste from the very plants you're touting 20 years ago. Those
who did the dumping *thought* they had done so responsibly..apparently they
were mistaken.

You're correct that coal and oil powered plants pose a far greater risk to
the environment at large due to air pollution. But, who makes the decisions
on where to dump nuclear waste? And, who informs the Little People of those
decisions? They apparently didn't deem it necessary to let the kids at River
Valley know...
