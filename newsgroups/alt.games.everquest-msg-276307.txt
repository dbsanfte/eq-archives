Sorry - I didn't mean you can tell the difference now, but that
the game designers could make the difference obvious if they
cared to.

Sure. Real money's more important. But it's all based on time
doing some sort of activity, unless we're talking about the
independently wealthy. I don't much care if someone gets
enough money to buy Super-Item X through working in the game
or out of it.

But if they can buy the items with money from inside the game,
how is that any better than with real money? As I understand
it, there are ways in most games to make money without really
overcoming any significant challenges.
