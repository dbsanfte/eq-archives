I'm going to bed now, but it was a productive first day. Yes, very stable, 
very smooth, I didn't see any problems anywhere. Granted, the population was 
low, but it was one of the smoothest game days ever, certainly better than 
any time in beta. Tomorrow will be a better test, but if it goes as smooth 
as today, this wil be a record setting smooth launch.

I was *not* able to get my desired name of Winterfury, the name filter 
suggested it might be "reserved or naughty". Since I was one of the very 
first logged on and saw no Winterfuries of any kind, I assume there's 
something about my name that they don't like.

So, Redbeard the Dwarf reprises his Beta1 role and becomes my main.

I got out into the market right away with App III spell upgrades (4sp) and 
managed to hit Artisan 9 before logging. I should hit 10 and start down the 
road to Scholar in the morning. Completed my Citizenship Quest and dinged 
Adventurer 7. Tomrrow I head out to Antonica to greet the masses who should 
be arriving throughout the day.
