This is interesting.  I *was* with bigpond but recently moved to a real isp
and therefore completely different DNS servers are involved but the problem
is still here :(  Also, if it was DNS related wouldn't it happen to both
machines at the same time?   There is only one link and the router sorts out
what machine gets what packets based on it's NAT table.  I'm guessing EQ
traffic is UPD and therefore lost packets are not resent, something is
interupting the UDP packets but only to one system.  What could cause this
within the OS?

When the machine is rebooted the other machine stays connected so I still
have the same leased ip number and I'm still on the same subnet.  But
rebooting the problem machine (sometimes several times) often solves the
problem.  Then both machines can happily EQ away for hours or at least until
system 2 locks up - but thats another problem...

I know this sounds odd but I suspect it is one or two particular player
models that trigger the packet loss/break-up.  Usually the problem occurs
straight away but sometimes I can play for hours and  it only happens after
another player enters my field of view or when someone zones in.   It use to
occur very rarely but happens much more frequently since Luclin.
