> I did mine and it gave a confirming message...

But the message is useless:

- if you did the movelog at 3.05pm (before the original scheduled start) it
gave the confirmation message)
- if you did the movelog at 4.05pm (after the original scheduled start) it
gave the same confirmation message
- if you did the movelog at 7.05pm (after the rearranged scheduled start) it
gave the same confirmation message

and I bet if you do a movelog on Tuesday after the movelog finishes, it will
STILL give the same confirmation message.

Problem seems to be that the command doesn't even know if a movelog is
scheduled, let alone whether any data is actually being recorded. You would
think that the default behaviour would be to tell you that there isn't a
movelog taking place, and that part of the enabling process would be to
change that behaviour.

People asked why the movelog couldn't close early when it is full. Simple:
they need to process the list to see how many are Europeans, and (if
necessary) to remove any non-Europeans from it.

My group of friends and relatives decided not to /movelog after the
rearranged start, having gone to great lengths to get 9 accounts /movelog'd
at 4pm. We thought that if they couldn't even get it turned on properly, the
chances of us all making it to the new server were pretty slim and that it
was more important to stay together.
