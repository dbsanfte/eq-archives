I repeat, she successfully FD'd out of all manner of other mobs in the
same zone, just to see if her FD was broken.  ONLY the "a cyclops"
gave her trouble and they did so EVERY TIME.

She clearly knows how FD works, (which is something I don't, so
I can't comment directly on your Auto Attack issue) as I've seen her
FD mobs all over Norrath and parts of Luclin

Also, a GM claimed that this was a feature.
