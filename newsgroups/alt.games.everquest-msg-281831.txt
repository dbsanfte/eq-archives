I think ya got to pick one or the other - either ya try to get all Time 
flagged and forget the Ele progression or just go back to square one and do 
the Ele progression. Id suggest you take the guild back and do the Ele 
progression and get everyone flagged for Time - then call the guild Time 
flagged. It will take some doing of course, usually you have to kill each 
twice to get the guild on the same page, but its worth it to rezero 
everyone.

Id also suggest you take a bit to think about recruits to your guild, 
require the flags ya dont want to go back for etc. Backflagging can go on 
forever if you dont take a stand somewhere.

Just my opinion - and Im often wrong.
