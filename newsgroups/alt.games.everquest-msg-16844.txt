Make leather paddings for blacksmiths.  The recipe is pretty simple and can 
be accomplished even with a small Sewing Kit.  The ingredients are farmable 
by newbies, and the end result stacks, weighs 0.1 each and sells for 5pp 
each.  You can even buy the ingredients off a vendor and still make a 
healthy profit.

Combine 2 Spiderling Silks to make Silk Thread.

Combine 1 Silk Thread with one Low Quality pelt (can be Wolf, Cat or Bear) 
to make Leather Padding.

Make a bunch of Silk Thread before you start combining it with the pelts to 
get your tailoring up.  Silk Thread trivials at 21.  Combining spiderling 
silk never fails, take advantage of the skillups in tailoring while they're 
free.

High Quality and Medium Quality pelts can be made into the Low Quality 
pelts you need.  Early on, ask the blacksmith you sell to to make you a 
Skinning Knife in trade for a leather padding or two.  He might even just 
give you one for free, if they like to keep their padding sources happy and 
productive.  In your sewing kit, combine the Skinning Knife with a HQ pelt 
and you will get the knife back and a MQ pelt.  Do the same with a MQ pelt 
and you will get the LQ pelt you need for padding.  Don't do that with the 
HQ bear pelts, though!  Sell them to tailors for 20pp or 30pp each so they 
can make the 10 slot weight reducing backpack.  But go ahead and do it with 
HQ and MQ Wolf and Cat pelts, and MQ bear pelts.  MQ pelts are also used to 
make studded leather armor in tailoring, and HQ cat and wolf pelts are used 
for reinforced leather armor, but I don't think there is much market, if 
any, for these armors.

Ruined pelts are used for cloth armor only, and named pelts (like Shadow 
Wolf Pelt or Misty Wolf Pelt or Puma pelt) are used for other things.  
Neither can be used for Leather Padding.
