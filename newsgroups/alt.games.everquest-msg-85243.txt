Not sure why you came up with 20/40...switch them around and you've got a
Gore run.

You only need cleric, shaman, druid and enchanter buffs to cover the gamit.
Ok (using my revised numbers of your numbers), 40 warriors, 20 clerics, 4
shaman, 4 druids, 1 epic enchanter...if you have 2 necros handy you can
probably replace a couple shaman or druids.

Cool, so you immediately jump to one of the most difficult raids from one of
the easiest?  I'm talking about MOST raids, not specific ones.
