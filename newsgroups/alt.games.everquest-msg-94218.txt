Are you really saying this?  Do you really mean that when you're running 
to zone, with a train behind you, and there are people at the zone line 
you stop, check on the mobs, and then type a warning in say?
Do you get pleasure out of training people, or do you honestly not 
understand how the game works?  As soon as you zone, the mobs drop you off 
of their hate lists, and if they haven't aggro'd anyone else, they wander 
back to their spawn points/wandering paths.  By stopping to check on the 
mob status, type out a leisurely warning, and then saunter across the zone 
line, you're pretty much ensuring that the mobs will get close enough to 
the people to aggro on them.  If you wanna be anti-social, just fucking 
run, don't be a dick and train people too.
