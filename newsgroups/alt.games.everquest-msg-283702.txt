The recent thread about Feign Death included some mention of
using audio triggers to let you know when FD fails, or when
a spell hits you and breaks the feign.  It occurred to me that
I haven't seen much discussion of audio triggers in general,
so I figured I'd start a thread on it.

I've found AT's to be an incredibly useful addition to the game.
There's just too much text flying by; even when I direct some
of it to specific chat windows, I tend to miss stuff in the heat
of battle.  So I've set up about two dozen triggers that let me
know about various things.

In general, I use the audio to warn me when something happens
that I didn't cause.  So for instance, spell fizzles/resists are
NOT in my triggers, because if I'm casting a spell I know to
check quickly for those messages.  (I have them in one of the
low-traffic chat windows, in a nice distinctive red.)  And so
far, I've gotten by almost exclusively using just the original
set of audio files supplied by the game.

I use some of the more alarming sounds for urgent events such
as a mob going Enraged or invis fading, and quieter sounds for
stuff like my spells wearing off.  And I have a few that are
just for information, such as when someone sends my bazaar mule
a tell and gets my AFK response; if I'm actually near the
computer, the audio trigger alerts me to look at what they said.

There are also short-term special cases, of course.  On a raid,
the RL sometimes recommends using a trigger that watches for some
key phrase telling folks when to act.  And when I was camping in
Karnors recently, I found that spectral curates passing by on
different levels (nowhere near line of sight) would sometimes
pause to Complete Heal the mobs I was fighting, so I triggered
on "spectral curate begins to cast" to know if one was in range.

Anyway, those are (mostly) general thoughts.  Here are some
specific phrases that I trigger on, and my choice of audio:

Alert3 (for urgent stuff; the first several cover various forms of invis):
	You appear.
	You feel yourself starting to appear.
	You become visible.
	The mystical foliage vanishes.
	Your shadows fade.
	You feel a bit dispelled.
	has become ENRAGED
	canceling auto-follow
	The item has dropped to the ground!

Alert4 (something I just tried has failed):
	Sorry, but you don't have everything you need for this recipe
	<myname> has fallen to the ground
	You are no longer feigning death
	You need to equip a shield in order to BASH
	You can't fish without

Alert2 (stuff I want to know about but usually not urgent):
	has worn off

Alert5 (player-player interaction I would sometimes overlook):
	'Hail, <myname>'
	invites you to join a group
	is no longer enraged
(yeah, the last isn't player-player; I use it as an all-clear after
the "has become ENRAGED" trigger, and usually there's no hailing or
inviting going on at that point!)

Tell2:
	tells the group,

Thump:
	tells the guild,

Thump2:
	You have become better at

The only trigger for which I made my own audio file is one that
triggers on any mention of "Complete Heal".  This fires when a
cleric has a hotkey announcing the cast, or if "Spell Awareness"
tells me that a PC or mob is casting it.  The audio announces
"Complete Heal in 8, 7, 6..." and gives me a pretty good idea of
whether the spell is going to go off in time.  (Or, in the case
of a mob casting it, it tells me how long I have to interrupt it.)
