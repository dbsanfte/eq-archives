I'd forget you are a caster, basically. An sk is a melee type first,
so forget things like int. Stuff like sentient armor is pretty darn
bad these days, even for a newbie. For what you spend on it you may as
well get good stuff you'll be doing well in at 55. 

Go in the bazaar and order gear by price and look for high AC stuff.
Like a barbed ringmail at 30 ac and 50 hp is great. Get some other
great HP stuff, like velium fire opal rings or whatever. 

For legs, the cheapest good ones are probably acrylla or something.
They have nice ac. Get a good damage to speed main weapon, and a good
shield with high ac and possibly HP as well.

The nice thing about the SK is you can probably go for AC and HP and
you'll end up getting some int and mana on stuff anyway. There are a
lot of affordable pretty good things like that for sks and paladins.

Do a search in the bazaar for haste, then order them by cost. I'd go
for something affordable with good haste and ac on it. I think the
sash of the dragonborn, or whatever that one is called, is good. Its
the one with 24 percent haste but I forget the exact name.

This is my sk alt here:

http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=527219

I've gone mostly for AC and HP, while it still ends up with an ok plus
mana and more than enough int and mana for casting stuff in game.
My only regret is that it isn't an ogre, since at 42 the racial regen
is not a big deal while the ogre's superior stamina and not being
stunned from the front would help.

That scepter of lightning weapon is good, but was cheap as dirt.
Probably because its fairly common and has a recc. level which means
its not so hot for real low level characters. Its still fantastic at
40 or 42, though. 

Jagged bone hoop is another fantastic item for the price. I think I
paid 200 plat for it.
