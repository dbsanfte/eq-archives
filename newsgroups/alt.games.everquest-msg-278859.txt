Sony has an online FAQ which has proven to be helpful a few times. I
have had times when going LD would come for days or weeks and then just
go away. A typical solution is to try to disable the different
peripherals until the problem goes away. You  might even halve the
memory (i have seen posts that claim EQ crashes more with more memory);
or maybe one of the dimms is bad.

LD problems are the more frustrating.
