And one more thing about this silly racist comment you make...

When Great Britain and France declared war on Germany because Poland got
invaded, your country was too busy patting itself on the back about the fine
war memorial you made for Hitler...

You got owned by Lithuania, then Lithuania got owned by Russia.

In the last two world wars you have done nothing to help in any substantial
measure:

Bottom line here is I really don't care... The sacrifices other substantial
and significant nations make decide the fate of the world. It would be nice
if Sweden was part of them one way or the other, but sadly that isn't the
case.

I made a comment about how as time moves forward, lesser nations gaining
control of technology will lead to problems of misuse. Which is a FACT.

You suddenly felt personally offended as if I said, "As technology moves
forward, Sweden will lead to problems of misuse.".

Furthermore it's almost as if I said, "As technology moves forward,
Barbarian X will misuse it!".

Before you come screaming out of the peanut section, waving the Swedish flag
at me like it means something other than neutrality (if not shame and
sadness), while contesting the sacrifice of lives and effort made by those
who fought for your comfy environment in Sweden, I would read up on your
countries own history and figure out if you were personally, or even your
county, was ever attacked verbally to begin with. It will certainly save you
and your country some public shame.
