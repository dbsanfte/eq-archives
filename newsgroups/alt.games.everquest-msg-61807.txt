You cant hold a camp from another place.
When i was camping the Hermit in SK, i got overburdened with FS weapons, 
and had to do sell run to Centaurs. Only thing i could do was to wait 
untill someone made a camp check, answer Hetmit camped, and then run as 
fast as i could to Centaurs to sell and gate back.
If it was taken when i got back, well, bad luck.
