SAVE THOSE POINTS!

I split the bulk of my save training points between Feign Death and Instill
Doubt and I'm glad I did.

I have a lvl20 human monk with both skills mastered.  A lot of players will
tell you not to bother with Instill Doubt but as a soloing monk it comes in
very handy.  At this lvl I normally get around two ID's off during a fight.
You get to do a little Fear-Kiting  :)
