Indeed, and would have been completely unacceptable.  The recount, however,
also proved Bush to be the winner.

Not true.  The Supreme Court is pretty much balanced.  Renquest, Scalia,
Thomas, and Kennedy are strong conservatives, and O'Conner is anybody's
guess.  Nobody can figure out what that girl is going to do.  Even if it was
5/4, that would not be "dominated," and because it's 4/1/4, there's no
veracity to that claim.
