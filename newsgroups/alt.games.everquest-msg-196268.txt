Chip chip and more chip. I think I saw a dwarf who did 5000. You will
have to empty Kurns Tower. Yell for me on the age channel, and I will
help you out.

That is the canonical method. I hear you will have poor SK faction, so
watch out! I think thats greenmist, I can't recall. Killing the
escaped frogloks is good, turning in the shackles to the toilmaster
helps, and I have been kiting the guys in SONH.

I dunno, bone chips sounds like the best way short term. Maybe do some
Necro skullcap parts that occur in outpost, if you have enough VS
faction. There are two parts in the Overthere.

Rites of exhonoration allow you to get your newbie stuff, and may help
faction.
