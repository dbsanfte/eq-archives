The word is spelled gnoll, not gnol. Just being picky on spelling is
all. ;-)

I don't actually know the specifics of the quests. All I know is all
of the new drops that were added in the Qeynos area are for those
quests, similar to the quests that have been added for Dark Elves (In
Nektulos), Halflings (Misty Thicket), Gnomes (Steamfont), and Freeport
humans/half-elves (ECommons/NRo). Gradually, all of the newbie areas
will eventually get these quests for the "local" races.
