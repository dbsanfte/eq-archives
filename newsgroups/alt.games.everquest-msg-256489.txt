There's augments with ratio restrictions that help out slower weapons
more.

This is flat out wrong. Proccing is determined independently of delay.
A standard proc rate weapon with delay 75 will proc the same (on
average) number of times per minute (2 with max dex and no WA) as a
weapon with delay 17. This has been borne out by Steelwarrior parses.
(The only exceptions are very marginal or rare - ie two different
procs can't go off on the same attack, and given normally the ratio of
attacks to procs is so high this requires hours of nonstop combat
parsing to even be outside statistical margin of error to notice.)

Well the obvious conclusion would be: play a melee longer and see how
ldon augments and proccing work. :-p

You know you can sell the augment back now, right? It's at a discount,
so not 100% of your points back, but it makes upgrading easier.

Or is this still only on Test? I never know when things fail to go
live....
