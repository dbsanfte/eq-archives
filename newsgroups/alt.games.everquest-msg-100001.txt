I've had it set to off since it went in.  Great feature.  However it does
annoy me now when I notice someone inspecting me... but then thats since I
only notice the obnoxious ones.   Like they will walk directly up to your
character, stop while standing almost directly on top of you, and sit there
staring you in the eye, so to speak.    Move back a few spaces to get a little
room, and they follow you and stand right in your face again.

Next usually comes the "What is X item you're wearing?  Stats?  Where did you
get it?  Can I buy it? I have 2k!"
