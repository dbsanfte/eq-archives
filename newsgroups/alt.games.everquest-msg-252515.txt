I got this spell back at 44 or so, and it was a really nice thing to 
have considering I tend to lean towards pet healing instead of nuking 
anyway.  Sadly, it doesn't scale up as you level, and by my mid 50s it 
was only something I used if I was in "and throw the kitchen sink at it 
too" mode.  If I get Planar Renewal it will be even worse, since that 
spell has roughly a 4.1:1 ratio

Yep, I never bothered going after this one since it was at best a mild 
increase in haste and would soon be superceded by my next haste.

When you consider spells like Temperance and Stoicism, I think mages 
really got robbed with this duo of spells.  Then again, its quite 
possible that other classes got far more worthless spells, the people at 
SOE have never been very good at balance.
