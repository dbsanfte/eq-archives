So how is "playing a Jedi intended to discourage powergamers?"  Anything
they can do to discourage a player who is willing to spend six+ hours a
day playing to optimize his ability is going to have a far worse impact on
someone who only plays six hours a week.

The only "reasonable" assumption I can see that would support your
statement is that a powergamer is far more likely to compromise his
integrity to get power than a roleplayer.   (For example, a "good" Jedi
played by a powergamer killing something "good" to get items or whatever
where a roleplayer wouldn't do it.)  And, frankly, that's a VERY bad
assumption.  People do that in EQ because the faction system has no
real permanence;  they wouldn't do that in SWG if it does.  And, if they
did and found they could no longer "advance" because of it, the
powergamer is far more likely to delete and recreate a character (or
simply buy another account) and not do it again.  Your roleplayer is
simply stuck due to an increased "bond" with the character.

As far as the "any powergamer who steps away" comment goes, the
only assumption from that is that roleplayers don't "step away."  And
that's ludicrous.   A powergamer will be surrounded by other
powergamers, probably within minutes of creating the character.
A roleplayer might be as well, but that's not going to give him any
additional protection, just the same amount.   As an example, I'm sure
a good number of my guild will move *intact* to SWG, at least on a
trial basis.  That's probably 20 or so people who will start playing
SWG as a team from day one.  Sure, a roleplaying guild might do that
as well, but how's that better?   Arguably, the powergaming guild is
going to start off faster and stronger, providing their members greater
protection.
