I did notice one thing.  Once I received a temporary ability, it was I think 6
flash bang grenades.  I figured, cool, I'd save them until I really need them.
That ability went poof without me using them about an hour later.  Other than
that, all good.  So many things are done right, maybe I'll write up a list
sometime.
