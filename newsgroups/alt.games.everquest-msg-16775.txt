2 options.  Find a friend and hand items to them to hold for alt character
or drop on the ground, log out and log back in with the second character to
pick it up.  If you use the second option, find a nice quiet spot that is
distinctive (inside abandoned buildings is good or the top floor of an inn
works well, who wanders around there?[famous last words]) to do the drop.
There is always a chance someone will come along in the 45 seconds between
drop and log in, though.
