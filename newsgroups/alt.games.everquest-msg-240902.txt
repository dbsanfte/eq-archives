I take it you did not read the post that started all of this flaming.
To paraphrase I asked the group why top posters were abused in this
group and then sited groups which I participate in which are primarily
top posters.

I was then rounded on and abused (primarly by Sisson, Bizbee and Dark
Tyger) called a f...tard and other names for asking what I saw as a
valid question.  Despite contextually posting others jumped on the
bandwagon calling me a top poster (which I am not and continuing the
abuse).

I included statistics taken from my groups over a period of 2 days
which showed quite clearly the majority of posters in those group were
top posters (in some cases this was a close call but in all top posters
came out on top pardon the pun).

At no stage did I defend top posters or any type of poster.  I did the
post which you refrred to which was an attack by one of my groups on a
bottom poster to show relevance to my contention that they are
primarily top posters.

My orginal question (why does this group abuse top posters) was quite
neatly sidetracked by Sisson, Bizbee and Dark Tyger.

I could have coped with any number of answers such as:

1. We are the original net nazis.

2. The group does not believe in freedom of speech, thought or deed.

3. Because it is netiquette and we follow a set of non-existant FAQs
which proclaim it. or even.

4. Because

I got none of those answers and instead got attacked without
provocation.

I know but I aim to ensure that visitors to this group do not get
burnt, like I did for asking a vald question,  because primarily people
in this group are helpful with the exception of the "Fab Three".
