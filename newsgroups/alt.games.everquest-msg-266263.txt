Your download speed : 4984759 bps, or 4867 kbps.
A 608.4 KB/sec transfer rate.
Your upload speed : 3536512 bps, or 3453 kbps.

I think my real speeds are actually much higher than that (I should
have something around 60 Mbps total up/down available at this location
and only 12 or so are being used at the moment. Not sure this utility
can check that high. The router connecting the office to the backbone
limits me.)... I'm at work though, and I work at an ISP =)
