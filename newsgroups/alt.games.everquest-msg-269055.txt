Another question is, for every complaint, how many incidents went
unreported? A lot of players felt that reporting KSing did no good,
since the KSer has to be caught in the act and often gets away. This
creates an illusion to a lot of people that GMs and Guides simply
didn't care about KSing and nothing would every be done about it, so
reporting it is a waste of time. Others, while frustrated by KSing,
didn't feel it was worth the effort to complain. Another thing I've
faced is an attitude among many players that player disputes should be
sorted out between the players rather than "running to mommy", so to
speak. I'd estimate that the complaints that came across our "desk"
were but a fraction of the incidents that actually occurred.
