Could you hack the XML of the new UI so that one macro button trips
another after completion ? (I'm not sure if this is possible, but could
you have it that when the button un-greys it trips the next button ?)

Then with some thought you could set up a chain of macro buttons.

Not sure what the point would be, but I bet someone could find a way to
make it do all their trade skills or practice divination spells.

(ok so the custom skin would be no good for normal use, but that is what
/loadskin is for)

Any ideas ?

Jim
