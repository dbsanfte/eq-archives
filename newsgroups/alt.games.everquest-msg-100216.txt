  If you're really into EQ, you probably should buy the expansions, or at
least the ones that your system can run alright (if your system was built
within the past 2 or 3 years, you should be alright).

  From the Kunark expansion, you get access to another continent with areas
suitable for characters of just about any level.  You also can play an Iksar
(lizardman) character.

  From Velious, you get access to another continent with areas suitable for
level 30ish characters and up, and a better user interface.

  With Luclin, you get access to moon Luclin which has hunting areas
suitable for characters of just about any level range.  You also get access
to the Nexus, which is a good travel aid.  It also allows you to play a
beastlord character (new class) or a Vah Shir (the cat man race.)  Also, you
get access to "alternate advancement" skills for level 51+ characters.
Luclin also includes texture upgrades for original EQ zones (and older
expansion zones) which make the game look considerably better in some
places, plus new character models for all of the races, and elementals
(which you can switch on or off depending on your taste or what your system
can handle).

  Any expansion will allow you to advance past level 50.

  Those are the main advantages, though there are a few others.  Expansion
zones tend to look better, tend to be more sophisticated, and often have
better loot than comparable old world zones.  Once you get in a guild (if
you're not already in one), you may find that a lot of your guildmates like
to spend a lot of time on Kunark or Velious, and you don't want to miss out
on raids, and other grouping activities because you don't have the
expansions.

  If you think you're going to continue playing EQ over the next several
months or years, buy the expansions... if you're not sure, you may want to
hold off.
