If your car has a flat tire and a broken tailight are you happy if just the
broken tailight gets fixed? I know what I would do if I was in control to
both druids and shamans , if they do more than this I will look at them a
bit weirdly if they do less I still wont be satisfied. Pretty much I figure
this is how everyone feels about the subject who is not involved in it. What
we disagree on is how badly they are broken. If it where up to me I would,

1) add a healing spell at lvl 44 that cost 500 mana and healed 10k that had
a 12 second casting time.
2) fiddle with the healing spells for both non cleric priests so that they
made some sense between levels 30-60. Keeping it so that while clerics where
always ahead the other two never fell behind more than 25%.
