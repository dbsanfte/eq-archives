If they're smart they'll do what Blizzard did for the WoW signups and have a
start-time and end-time for applications and make it VERY CLEAR to everyone
that it won't matter when during that period you sign-up, your chances are
all independent of timing. Failing to do that will undoubtedly cause a web
server overload as the start time approaches.

That's if they're smart.
