I know from a later post that you're running WinXP.  Since I've had zero
problems with my Linksys that I've been running for about 2 years and since
I know that XP has built-in firewall software (though I haven't bothered
fiddling with it since I don't trust MS that far), I'm thinking maybe that
maybe that's the problem.  You might try disabling it.

Stolen from WinXP help:

To enable or disable Internet Connection Firewall
Open Network Connections
Click the Dial-up, LAN or High-Speed Internet connection that you want to
protect, and then, under Network Tasks, click Change settings of this
connection.
On the Advanced tab, under Internet Connection Firewall, select one of the
following:
To enable Internet Connection Firewall (ICF), select the Protect my computer
and network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the
Internet check box.
To disable Internet Connection Firewall, clear the Protect my computer and
network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet
check box.
