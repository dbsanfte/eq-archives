Though I will always need someone to flip my burgers and collect my 
garbage from the curb, it would be just peachy, and quite appreciated I 
might add, if those services could be rendered by people who give a crap. 
I just don't understand people who have no interest in doing well 
whatever they do. There is a serious lack of pride prevalent in society 
today, yet those same apathetic ingrates will be some of the very first 
to criticize or run self-promotional smack on others.

Sorry, but if you're unable to pick up my trash on Monday mornings 
without leaving a portion of it scattered across my driveway, then your 
"d00d i r0xx0r5 n roo1 j00" rings pretty hollow. Games are a diversion, 
not a superior substitute for your pathetic life.

Sorry. /tangent off
