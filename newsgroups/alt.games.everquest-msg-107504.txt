}You are also forgetting haste. Melee classes usually have haste items,
}most clerics don't (I hope). Also, would the shaman or chanter cast haste
}on the cleric?

Yes, I would and have hasted the cleric.  I've even been known to give 
them Boon of the Garou.  It makes the cleric happy and amuses the melees.  
That's precisely what my mana is for.

Sure, for some, this game is all about making the most absosmurfly 
efficient possible exp or raid group.  More power to them.  But a little 
fun won't kill ya.  If you want to sit there and whine about how the 
cleric shouldn't be meleeing, that's gonna make me want to leave the group 
a lot more than the fact that the cleric is meleeing.  God, whining bores 
me.

As to the haste item, if the cleric is planning on meleeing and he happens 
to have one, it would be a good idea to equip it, wouldn't it?  What? 
you're afraid he's going to manage to taunt off you?  Does your warrior's 
equipment suck that badly?
