In my opinion, "balance" would ideally mean that either of the three tank
classes would be equally preferable in an exp group, with warriors still
being MT on raids.  If you make warriors essential to an exp group, it is a
nerf to knights.  I don't see how it could be seen any other way.  Knights
would be relegated to DPS, and would rarely if ever get any groups at all.
Deja-vu all over again :-)

So making a warrior essential to every group would not fix the situation, it
would just reverse it.  Also keep in mind that things that are not
necessarily essential to the game, can often be seen as essential - for
example that other thread about tracking.  Tracking is seen by many players
as essential in the situations that were discussed (Seb key, checking if a
raid mob is up, etc.) and so no one does those things any other way.  The
point here is that if warriors are again seen as the best tank, then no one
will do things any other way, and warriors being essential to groups is a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

Also, making defensive discipline more useful or essential would have no
effect on the pre-55 crowd (there are a few of us left), and in my opinion
any fix should work across all levels.  Perhaps they could add more
disciplines for warriors, at lower levels and with short re-use times.  It
would almost be like spells, only they obviously wouldn't use mana.  Anyone
care to point out what obvious flaws I'm missing with that idea? :-)
