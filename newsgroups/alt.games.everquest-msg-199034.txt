    What is the end use of this coin, though? If it's "buying stuff for the
main/alts in The Bazaar", then have the bazaar merchant buy stuff with
profits and pass it over with the shared slots. If the target character has
reasonable JC skill and the bazaar merchant has top CHA for buying, you
could pass gems and silver bars through the shared slots and pay 5% penalty
on the transaction. Unless your character is constantly making small
purchases of services from other characters, it's not a huge issue.

    I tried to simulate the results of the gear selection by looking in The
Bazaar for items that fit any race of a given class, and cost 50 pp or less
each. It was very close to bang-on. If the choices are uneven across class
lines, it would be because the choices available to classes are uneven. For
example, there just isn't a MoSS-alike available to paladins. The best
weapons I found in the bargain bin were a Crystalline Blade, Black Alloy
Bastard Sword, and Centi Warspear. So one of the knights is going to come
out ahead of the other.

    That was a little odd. Perhaps each class had a person shopping for
them, and they went to different servers to shop? I know I was able to find
a Lizardscale Cloak for 50 pp on Quellious when I did my simulation.

    Was food and drink included in the kits? Could just be that no
consumables were included.
