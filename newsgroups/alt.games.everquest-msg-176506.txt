    Hello,

    I have been toying around with a Beast Lord. I have played several races
for the first few levels to get a feel for them. One thing that hasn't been
immediately apparent, is keeping the dagger and learning piercing, or just
concentrate on hand to hand. Which would be best? Also, will other fighting
skills be needed later on? Thank you

    Grey
