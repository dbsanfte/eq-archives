Hehe, thanks for the advice, sometimes a pain to be a big guy in the
dungeons.  An ogre and I were fighting with a necro in Befallen (unshrinked
mind you)... and the necro ran ahead and aggroed a room.  His pet stood in
the doorway happily punching away while we stood there wedged like the 2
stooges.  Needless to say it got ugly for the necro.  Next time, we shrink
or we don't go.
