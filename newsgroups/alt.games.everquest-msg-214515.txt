I've only done one run through a LDoN dungeon so it's hard to make any
reliable estimates but I don't think you're gonna need high DPS to
finish it. 

  The group I took in was SK, Pally, Cleric, Druid, Enchanter and
shaman; 6 of the worst DPS classes out there although since it's a
weekly exp group we do have a lot of practice working together. Group
was 65 with an average of around 40AAs and mediocre gear at best. 

We got what I gather is the toughest quest out there for a low DPS
group, kill 60 mobs in L Guk, actually more like 70 mobs since you get
trap spawns that don't count towards the 60 mob total. We got off to a
very slow start because our enchanter couldn't zone in intially (he
was on a computer where he hadn't downloaded LDoN dungeons) so 15
minutes into the adventure we only had 6 kills. We came reasonably
close to making it, 53 out of 60 when time ran out. I'm pretty sure we
could have made it w/o the initial distractions. ... we did complete
it after the time limit had expired and got 13 adventure points. 

Our low DPS group seemed to have a couple of advantages, the main one
being that we didn't waste any time trying to split mobs since we
could handle 3 or 4 pretty easily. Since we also had evac, the one
time we got in trouble we evac'd and were back killing stuff within
about 2 minutes. 

High DPS classes will make things easier though, replace the
druid/pally in our group with a Mage/BST and the crawl would have been
trivial. I don't work that way, my groups consists of whatever friends
are online at the time but I can see where the high DPS classes are
gonna be in demand for pickup groups. You're either going to need high
DPS or a group that's used to working together to finish the
adventures, low DPS pickup groups need not apply.

I'm pretty sure that everything (single group) has a 90 minute time
limit now (longer for raids). 

Some general comments on what I noticed. 
- FD pullers might not be required, but they're nice to have. Not
because you want to pull singles but because they can bail out of a
bad pull if they get more than 3 or 4. 

- Unless the group is seriously Uber, crowd control of some type is
gonna be required. One of Enchanter/Bard/Shaman is a good thing,  more
than one is probably overkill. 

- Moving efficiently as a group is a must and something our group
needs to work on. 

I do have one question for people, I asked for an adventure intially,
turned down the one that was offered and it wouldn't let me ask for
another one. I made someone else group leader and they were able to
get another mission. Is there any way to pick and choose what type of
mission you want to run? 

Rgds, Frank
