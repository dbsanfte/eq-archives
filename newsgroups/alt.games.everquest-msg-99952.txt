If your group jumps off a cliff, do you hold their hand on the way
down?

I was playing my lvl 13 cleric grouped in a derv camp in NRo when the
puller made a bad pull. Of course we all died. Upon retrieving our
corpses, a druid in the group tried to harmonize and it was resisted
resulting in another bad pull. I tried healing the druid which aggro'd
the MOB onto me. Again, we all died. After retrieving our corpses
again, the druid did the same thing, again resulting in a bad pull.
This time I didn't partake in the masacre and I was the only one left
alive. As a result, I was shunned from the group, branded a coward,
not to return. Not that I was all that glad to be in a group that
didn't know how to pull anyway.

I want to hear from people and what their opinions are on this issue.
Should a cleric, knowing that the MOB pulled in can easily wipe out
the group, help out even if it means the death of the cleric? In my
humble opinion, the puller should have a sense for what the group can
and can not handle and upon making a bad pull, should lead the MOB
away from the group to die like the warrior they are instead of
risking the life of everyone in the group.

Thanks for your replies.
