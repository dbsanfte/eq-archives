And dont forget the Giant Fort there,nice place for mid
twenties,easysingle pulls and a safe spot inside left up the hill at
south entrance.

Tried the Brutes in the tunnels to Dalnir 2 weeks ago,spawn has
changed,no more easy single pulls,and they added 3 roamers in
the tunnel,old pathing problems still the same,and Brutes add out
of the blue,really a bad place now.
