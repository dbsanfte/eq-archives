}HEHE, OK yeah Consumer Reports..They know all. 

No, they don't know all.  But I don't know of anyone who publishes the 
results of more rigorous and thorough tests af a vehicle's reliability.

Accord has been finishing near the very top of the heap for years now.  
That means less time fiddling with things and taking it to the shop. Now, 
compare that with how often things tend to go wrong with cars that are 40 
years old, and how much more effort you have to spend fooling with 
carburetors and whatnot...

Heh.  By my standards, any of that is looney. :)  I've never paid more 
than 3K for a car in my life.  Given a choice of the Accord or Crvette for 
free though, I'll take the Accord on the grounds that I'll be able to get 
many more miles per dollar out of it.  And, as I recall, has more room 
inside.  It -would- be a significantly harder choice with a Mustang than a 
Corvette, though.  But that's just personal taste.

Not that much, unless they suddenly become collectible, which I agree is 
unlikely.  However, -today- it would be more useful to me than the 
corvette, and therefore worth more.

By the way, did you notice you seem to be arguing for keeping the old 
(EQ) over settling for the new (EQ2) in this part of the thread?
