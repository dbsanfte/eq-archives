: I haven't played EQ since at least last fall. I have begun playing again 
: in the past week and heard talk in the EQTraders chat two nights ago of 
: a 500 trader limit in the Bazaar. I had gone trader mode a few nights 
: after resuming play and hadn't had any problems, I assume my server 
: (Cazic Thule) didn't have as much population as these other peoples' 
: servers and thus we didn't hit the limit.
: 
: That same night I heard them talking about it, however, I tried to go 
: trader and was unable due to the limit.
: 
: Is Verant planning to increase the limit or create another nearby zone 
: for trading? I can imagine the 500 trader limit is very annoying to 
: those who rely heavily upon their trading characters. I can't say that I 
: blame these people who have a second character just for trading, 
: considering they're paying for another account and are helping out the 
: game's economy (generally).
: 
: I'd love to see something done about this though.

They should fix it *right* and not require your presence to sell
stuff.  Requiring you to idle your box overnight to sell stuff
was a stupid design choice.
