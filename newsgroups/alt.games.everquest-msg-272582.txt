It's not an academic question for me, either.  A few years ago, I found 
a dup bug.  I verified it, filed a bug report, and sent email to SOE 
customer support.  I then waited.  Nothing.

A week later, I got a GM on chat and demonstrated it to him.  I filed 
another bug report, and sent another email to SOE CS.

I was then suspended for 7 days.

Four months later, the dup bug was finally fixed.  By that time, other 
people had discovered it, and you would find level 1's all over the 
place busily duping items.  The economy was devastated on our server, 
and it's never really recovered from it.

SOE can find their own fucking bugs as far as I'm concerned.
