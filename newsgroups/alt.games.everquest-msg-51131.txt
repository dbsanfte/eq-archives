Having switched to NAV recently from Macaffee, I would say the Mcaffee
is worse, and the way Mcaffee is now, it doesn't scan your boot
record/system files on startup any more etc.  part of the reason I
switched.  Mcaffee had gone to a web based system.  I bought into it for
the first year, when they said they wouldn't be supporting the old
Mcaffee I had anymore.  When my subscription ran out, I switched to NAV
and am much happier.
