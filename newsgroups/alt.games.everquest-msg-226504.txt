Certainly, but you also don't know what/how much was said before the
whole group got started. I kinda doubt that it was as simple as the
bard saying 'ok, I won't pull' and then running off to pull. Although
with the bards I know, it might have been that simple, it's second
nature for them to run off and line up more mobs when the one in camp
is down to half. Asking them not to pull is like asking me not to
slow, often it's just done out of habit. 

The only reason I spoke up was that comment about the bard not being a
team player because he wanted to pull. I thought that was kinda silly,
I wasn't trying to be too judgemental about any of the rest of it,
especially w/o hearing both sides.

I consider their CC as part of pulling and I don't think their charm
works on even a normal 65 adventure. At least the bard I group with
never uses charm in LDoN and he loves to charm everywhere possible. So
you're left with (over)haste, mana regen and a little DPS that you
loose for a little while if the bard moves out early to pull. Seems
like a good tradeoff to me.
