This isn't going to be the answer you want, but here it is. I had the same
issue that you did, same graphics card. (Bare eyeballs in sockets sound
familiar? Character names only displaying when viewed against a 3d sky?).
 A ProSavageDDR is not supported by EQ, so if you go to tech support, expect
to be told you're out of luck. I had to go buy another video card. I bought
a GeForce2 MX400 64MB. Costs 33 dollars or so, last time I checked
www.pricewatch.com . Not the best card by far, but will certainly hold you
over until some extra $$ trickles your way. If you look closely, you can
find free or lost cost shipping most of the time. And....(the silver lining)
you'll free up some system RAM that your onboard video was using (Oh, and
the GeForce card is better performing too)
