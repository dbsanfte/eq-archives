Agree on that one. You will remove a part of the usefullness/cash making 
  if eveyrone could get a port from NPCs, but binds are a whole 
different story. Think i got 15pp in total on binds so far, all 
donations, would only be reasonable if you could pay a NPC maybe 10-25pp 
for a bind instead of shouting for one for 15 min at WFP gate.
