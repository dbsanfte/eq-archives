The thinking, based on dev comments, is that the newbie armors are:

1.  Overpowered for the mobs that are hunted
2.  Will detract from people learning tradeskills (since
there will be no market for their wares until much later)

NOTE - this not *my* reasoning, but what I've gained of the
devs.  

Also, and this is my opinion, I think it's not going to matter
much.  All the extra stats and what have you were important while
powering up in Luclin zones - they won't be in the old world.

As far as what to wear - I first started my bard on Mar 18
of 1999 - I remember distinctly not getting out of leather
until level 15 or so.  That wasn't awful then, and the mobs
hadn't had their melee ability affected like they will on
this server.

Banded - The trivial levels on this stuff are way lower than
when I payed 1pp per AC.  It is more than good enough into the
20's.  Trivials range from 95-106.  I can't remember what that
makes the effective range to make it, but it's pretty low.  

I'd expect that, with the ease of mail quests (shared bank anyone?
Haven't tried it yet on the test server, but I'm thinking it might
work) and the vast knowledge base out there regarding skilling up
that we'll see banded for sale within 24 hours.

Bronze - if you're a shorty or a semi-shorty who wears plate, here's
your best bet.  Remember this stuff drops like candy in Unrest, and
will be cheaper than banded per AC once people start hunting there
(which is about when you need it).

Sol Ro armors - these were good enough in the day, and I expect they'll
be good enough now - get these in the 30's and 40's.
