The problem isn't so much that they're getting aggro, it's how fast they're 
getting aggro.

Example: we went to take down Gorenaire today.  I decide to /disc trueshot 
and plink away.  MT grabs aggro, so i start firing.  I hit for (don't 
laugh!) 38, a miss, 100, 128 all while slowed (so firing once about every 
10-12 seconds with a twisted longbow), and suddenly I have aggro.  If I had 
taken 4 swings with my windblade I would have outdamaged that by a long 
shot and not pulled aggro.

So yes, this seems horribly broken to me.
