Hi,

It often falls upon my shoulders to maintain the loot order withing our
groups.  The order ranges from simple (alpha) to "loot until 5pp or FS"
or "alpha loot, but then alpha for FS".

I'm tired of having to track this crap on a piece of paper and wondered
if there was a Winbloze/Linux util that I could run on my second machine
that would allow me to input the group's names and then just click when
stuff happens, thus always knowing who's loot it is?

Any pointers to where to get a util like this would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Mike
