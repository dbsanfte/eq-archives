One time I was riding the boat from Freeport to Butcher Block and my husband
needed help with something.  I knew I was almost there and didn't want to
miss the stop, so I asked him to watch for me and take me off the boat when
it arrived.  Being the total EQ duufus that he is, he watched me sail right
by.   Grrrrr.  So then I had to ride the boat all the way back to FP and
then back again to Qeynos.

Will I miss boats-no

However, that being said, the big boat that goes to Fironia Vie is really
cool looking and everyone should ride it at least once.  The big problem is
that the rides take too long and there is nothing to do on the boats.  If we
could practice fishing, or casters could practice casting it might ease the
pain.  Otherwise-ditch them.
