>And really, why is staring at a static spellbook any worse than
>staring at a static landscape?

1. If playing at higher resolutions (like 1024) the spell book screen
still displays as a 640x480 object. This makes all of the text in the
chat window much smaller, and harder to read.

2. Colors that are easy to read in full screen mode with a
semi-transparent chat window, are impossible to read in "Spell-Book"
mode against the yellow parchment background.

Removing the Spell Book would not hurt the game, or give an advantage
to lower level casters. EQ plays the same (except for specific
tactics) for a caster at level 1 as it does at level 60.

Champions of keeping the book, are simply expressing sour grapes. They
feel that everyone should have to suffer the same as they did. Just
like the Hybrids who whined when the EXP penalties were removed.

Everyone hates the book. That point is NOT in debate.

Cheers
