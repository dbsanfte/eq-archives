Not really - You also never did Gnomer or Uldaman from your responses 
(low level instances, and if you think pile on and attack works on
Thermaplug, you'll be racking up some repair bills)

It just doesn't seem like you ever did any of the excellent dungeon
group content.  Arguably the best stuff they did - until TBC that is.
The group content in there is excellent.

Nothing above ground requires more than that, but that's the casual
friendly nature of it - no grouping required for almost all non-dungeon
quests.  Maybe a quick group and nail an elite, but nothing complex.
