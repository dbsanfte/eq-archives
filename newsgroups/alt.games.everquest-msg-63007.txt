As a field tech for Pacific Bell, I can tell you that there a a few things that
can suddenly cut your modem speeds down aside from line errors.  Two most
notable causes are that your local carrier has changed your cable route from
straight copper to either pair gain or DAML.

Pair gain (just a project name really, might be called different things from
place to place) is the use of fiber-optic, coax or other broadband system to
get dial-tone to your general area, switching back to copper to distribute to
your street, then home.  Adding the extra steps of going digital to analog
signal tends to slow things down.

DAML (digital auxilliary main line, if I recall correctly) works like poor
man's ISDN.  It takes two phone numbers and turns them into a single digital
signal that can be carried on a single copper pair.  A remote unit is placed at
the house, translating the signal back into two services.  Again, extra steps
translating digital to analog and vice versa will slow things down to 28.8 at
best.

Changing services to these forms of equipment is done all the time at the
discretion of the local carrier depending on the need for facilities.  The
recipient of a POTS (plain old telephone service) line is only guaranteed a
modem speed of 9800, that means voice only and anything more is a freebie.  The
only way to guarantee internet speed is to pay for the appropriate service
(ISDN/DSL/T1, etc.)

Granted, these are not necesarilly the cause of your problem, just the two most
common.  It could be a bandwidth issure in the trunks, so on, ad nauseum.  Just
so's you know, even at 19200, youre getting twice what youre guaranteed.
