Of course, assuming that the intended word was "misapprehension", then, 
it was used correctly to begin with, merely misspelled.

In fact, when I put "misappresion" into m-w.com, I get two good 
candidates for the intended word, "misapprehension", and "misperception", 
either of which would have conveyed the intended meaning reasonably well.
