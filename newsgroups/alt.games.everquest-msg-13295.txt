Agreed. There is, IMHO, a certain amount of responsibility that goes along with
the Druid's god-like abilities to kite. If I and/or my party are sitting there
between fights for whatever reason, and a kiter pulls a mob through our spot and
it aggros on us, I really dont' give a good rat's ass who was doing what to whom.
If it's attacking me or my casters, it's now mine. (Assuming *we* didn't
attack/taunt it first which would be KSing.) If we are too low to take it on,
we'll run and take it up with the kiter in question later. If we are able, we'll
kill it, and if the druid complains, he's free to petition.
  Feel free to kite all you want, but keep your little charges under control and
away from others when doing so, or be prepared to lose your mob if they aggro on
your uninteded victims.
