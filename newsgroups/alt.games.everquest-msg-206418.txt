I believe that SOV and SOL both also include these levels, but that if you only
have "classic" you top out at 50; I -didn't- hear anyone say that (or see on the
box) that POP or LOY included this ability.  LOY would work with 51-65 disabled,
but POP would be pretty weird, other than the POK part, being an underpowered
level 46-50 character would be an odd way to experience tier one zones.

Remember when people used to pay the unimaginable sum of 100pp each for tailored
backpacks, so they could fill their bank slots with them for the 16 extra
slots?   Course with SOL you could buy 10 slot trader bags for 1pp each so that
became easier... well LOY adds 8 extra inventory slots, thats potentially 80
extra storage spaces!  What would people have paid for 80 extra spaces, given
that they were paying 800 pp just for 16?

This is a nice tool, better for officers than for the hoi polloi, but really
everyone in a guild can benefit from the ability to see the rest of the guild at
a glance with some useful information about it.  Alts are hard to keep track of
for more than a couple friends.

>

You gloss over this one, but to me its the "killer app" of LOY, like Luclin's
Bazaar and POP's POK books, combined with a good set of downloaded maps this is
a great time saver, letting me move across zones with abandon instead of using
the contorted and dilapadated (and apparantly not intended for general use)
coordinate system and /l'ing my way around.  The reason its so great is not the
maps themselves (frankly, offline maps off EQatlas are better looking and more
informative) but the fact that your current position is marked with a cursor, or
better still at high levels of sense heading, an arrow showing not only your
current position but which direction you are facing.  No guesswork, no fudge
factor, but instant and responsive information.  And the map scales at a whim,
so its useful for crossing large distances -and- for finding an exact spot at
close range.  Plus I can annotate the maps with my own notes, again placing them
precisely (assuming I can stand on the spot I want to mark).

Now the cartography system itself is admittedly sheer drudgery to use, so if you
-don't- download maps the system isn't really worth much, I'll admit.  But they
have enabled the system for various newbie zones and cities all around Norrath
for everyone and included maps, so its easy to play around with it and see what
its like before you buy, and finding maps online isn't hard at all (I downloaded
a fairly complete set in just one 10 minute download on my 56.6 modem)

Aye, this is pretty handy... I do wish it did a seperate log for each character,
especially since it insists on logging the dialog from everything from bats to
dragons.

This is true of the old /lfg system too.  Enhancing a system that too few people
use, to make it even more work, doesn't seem to have been a winner.  How about
instead giving us 1 point of exp per second while our lfg flag is on, but
subtracting 6000 points every time we decline when offered a group?  I know, I
know, thats impractical really, but how -do- you force people who are looking
for a group to just put the flag on?  I'll tell you one thing, fix the bug that
turns LFG off every time you zone!

While this was true until recently, now for the POP enabled there's a very nice
charm that gets better the more flags you have, and you get it for free just by
getting at least one flag.  Reportedly the single group versions of flags work
just as well as the raid level ones for this, and are achievable by solo
players.  I'm amazed not to see people auctioning to sell flagging, since one
person can flag himself and 5 others, and a flag is now worth a nice piece of
hardware in an otherwise almost certainly empty slot, or an upgrade to the POP
charm you already have.

This strikes me as the lamest race in the game, with mediocre stats for the
classes allowed, a racial ablity that consists of the ability to hold your
breath underwater longer (but who really spends time underwater without an EB
item anyway?) and little in the way of special equipment, frogloks are pretty
much half elves with different graphics.

OMG are you kidding?  Cleric spell Temperance, Aego for the under 60 set, and
since the recent change, the ONLY long duration HP buff for the under 45 set.
Shaman spell Stoicism, Torpor for the under 60 set (and for level 60+ that don't
have incredible luck or 100Kpp to spare) this spell is game altering for shaman
44 to 58 or so (whenever they get CHeal lite, which might work better for
canni+heal mana regen).  I can't speak for other classes, but for these two at
least we are talking major upgrades unless your character was 60+ when LOY came
out.

I was in this boat too for quite a while, but when I ran my shaman up I made a
point of trying them; Gunthak is a -great- zone for 35 to 45, with lots of
single pullable mobs that don't roam around so you can set your own pace, I was
happy here solo, with a partner, or with up to a full group.  Admittedly the
loot isn't anything to write home about, but better than what you'd see in
comperable Luclin zones, averaging 5pp per mob and a few little goodies, my
favorite being the one charge clarity item... too bad thats lore and not
stackable!  Dulak is a bit harder, you actually have to work to get singles
here, but its higher level, fun fighting, better loot (including the old
"planar" gems) and here's where you get the key elements for those level 44
spells.  Both Dulak and Gunthak have the same sort of high ZEM that made Paladul
and the POP zones so outrageously popular, too.  I haven't tried the other LOY
zones yet, the one thing that really sucks about them is that the access is off
of Stonebrunt, so unless you have a porter, from POK thats Tox, Paineel,
Warrens, Stonebrunt to cross just to get to Gunthak, which is the gateway to the
other zones.

You'd think they'd have learned from Luclin and later POK that we really want to
be able to move quickly to and from our target zones without having to beg for a
port or include a porter in the group.  Not that I have anything against
porters, but I have the same problem here as I do with the effort to make
enchanters and bards desirable again by stopping the KEI gravy train... there
arent any porters my level LFG most of the time!

This I'll grant you, they don't seem to be all that different from creatures
already in the game, different graphics but same combinations of basic abilities
and HP/AC/melee capability.  I'd have loved to see some mobs with very low HP
but ultra high DPS(have to be spell immune of course), or some that cast MOR on
you, or bard mobs that actually twist songs, or... well, different combinations
of existing abilities, and new abilities mobs elsewhere don't have.
