I don't know how you managed to rate that exception, I'm not aware of any
exceptions that were made. Perhaps you got into late beta and they had
relaxed the requirement? Dunno, but it wasn't exactly paying to get *into*
beta, it was paying for the discs (3) (a distinction which many people
failed to understand). Come to think of it, there was a buddy program
whereby people who got into beta could invite a friend of their choice into
beta. Perhaps you were one of those and maybe those weren't charged.

But yes, the vast majority of beta participants paid for their CDs.
