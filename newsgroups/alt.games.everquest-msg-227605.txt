Your face and your fingers look like the things you should focus on
upgrading first.  Prices are so skewed right now i can't tell you if its
affordable but the Valorium Rings of Gallentry are magnificent especially if
you can farm the components and know someone that will do the combine.
Elysian death mask for face is a nice upgrade that i've seen for sale off
and on in the bazaar.  Crystal spider eyes are nice and usually cheap.  If
you are getting kei then you have 20 points of wis to play with to get more
hp/sta/ac/ whatever.  If the numbers are correct for your equipment that is.
Crystal chitin shield is nice, you might find an upgrade for 9k or
less...maybe the shield that drops from wuoshi (never remember names of
things).
Final suggestion would be obulus death shroud but again i'm not sure on
prices.  Its mana pres 3 which works on 60 and below.  Wonderful item as
well with decent stats.
