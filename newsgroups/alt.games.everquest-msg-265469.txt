In line by 7 and out by 7:45.

Because polling places change with the wind it would be hard to keep up
with the changes. I didn't say impossible, but since voting on *any* issue
is a local matter, most of these changes would need to be made at least
yearly. Probably a money/lazy factor more than anything else. My buddy here
at work is going to vote at lunch (bad mistake if you ask me) and couldn't
get the Manatee County website to work at all. Imagine if the whole country
was looking at the same DB? Pandemonium.

Here in FL after the last vote they "upgraded" the websites with this
information. IF you can get them to work.

Kinda makes you feel warm and fuzzy, huh?

CNN has a pretty good site. Last I checked there were no results but that
figures as the polls only opened on the WC a few hours ago and they
probably wouldn't update till they are at least open there.

Why not? They are more community centralized then county or state (public)
buildings. They can't (or shouldn't) harass you within 150 ft anyway so
it's not like you're voting for Jesus (as some here in the southland would
so much love to do).

See above.

Why so? After the hurricanes down here there were many churches that opened
their doors so that other denominations could worship in their building if
the building was damaged or destroyed. While I'm not religeous at all
(agnostic), I don't believe there is a conspiracy within the church to
affect voting. They have too many other problems to get mixed up in that.

Wouldn't bother me a bit. As long as they don't harass me it's just a
building with voting machines in it to me.

Again it's no big deal. They are more centralized to the community.
