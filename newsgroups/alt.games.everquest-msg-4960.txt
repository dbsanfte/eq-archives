That's where you're wrong.

Any place that real people congregate and interact, even virtually,
is a "real" place, because there are real people involved and real
rules of civil conduct still apply.

As I've always said, there's absolutely no difference between
someone getting their jollies behaving like an asshole online,
and actually BEING an asshole.

Anything else is just a cheap excuse for not thinking you still
have to behave well.
