   Ok, to be honest with you, I agree with you that the guy was a jerk, who was
using your misfortune for his gain.  And I believe that in similar
circumstances, 99% of the "nice" people playing the game would have tossed off
that nuke to save you, if they were not oom or afk.  It would have cost him
nothing to do what you asked.  In similar circumstance, I might put this guy on
my "don't lift a finger to help, ever" list.

   But still, my opinion is that he was under absolutely no obligation at all to
help you out.
