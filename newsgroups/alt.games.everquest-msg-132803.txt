So obviously, since not all parents will feel the same way, we better not 
even try in a public arena until an age where it's safe to assume the 
parents are dead?  Is that what you're saying?  So we'd better not 
accidentally include any artices about AIDS in, say, Newsweek, since 
someone under 30 could get ahold of that, and boy, wouldn't his momma have 
a cow?

You're dodging the question.  At what age do you think it is reasonable 
for children to be exposed to these ideas by an educator?

}Surely you are not advocating the premise that ALL kids are ready at
}the same age??

No, don't see where you got that at all.  But I think that there are parts 
of the issue it would be safe to discuss with even a two year old.

Well, there's no denying you are in company, at any rate. :) I'm reminded 
of the classic line about, "If all your friends jumped off a bridge, 
should you, as well?"

Your spelling asn't particularly bad until you got deliberate about it.  
Your punctuation has an odd habit of multiplying at the ends of sentences.  
It makes you sound so startled by everything.
