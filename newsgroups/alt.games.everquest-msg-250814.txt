And that is the $64 question.  What made them think for even a heartbeat
that going live with the DX9/Collision upgrade was a good idea?  Everyone
involved knew they were buggy as hell.  After 5 years (over 2 or 3 of them
with 2 accounts) I haven't played (or payed) in over 2 months, and I'm
on the verge of walking away completely -- the DX9 fiasco was a huge 
motivator toward that.

Wish I could remember which summit report it was in, but one of the
Devs is reported as saying they wish they had never called it EQ II.

100% agreement here.

They pushed the upgrade live with bugs that were known from the days 
of the GoD beta - 5 months before.  That smacks of arrogance and 
incompetence.
