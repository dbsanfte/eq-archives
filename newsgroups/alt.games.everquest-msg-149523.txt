    Black Panther also has more total stat points. They're in useless
things, but you know how people get about stats. I still see people wearing
freaking Serp Bracers, or that new Serp-like bracer that's AC 4 but with big
STR/DEX, or silken cat-fur girdles....

    There's still some pieces that sell well. I can move just about every
reinforced mantle and studded sleeves I make, because those are very good
for specific classes (monk and druid) but not so good that any moron could
figure it out (like the 10 WIS cloak).

> Here is what my monk is wearing at level 55:

    I'll contrast with what my monk has. I won't say the level of my monk as
a courtesy to John. ;-)

> Arms:      Azure Sleeves            AC 12, Wt 0.6

    Those are the standard monk arms, and are pretty cheap. Higher end is
the Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves my monk has (Wt 1.00. +16 AC, +6 Str, +6
Sta, +6 Dex, +5 vsCold, +25 HP).

> Back:      Steel Threaded Cloak     AC  9, Wt 0.3, +4 Str, +3 Sta, +1 Dex,
+1 Fire, +1
> Cold, +8 HP

    Steel Threaded is the Twilight Seas quest armour, and it's really
exceptional stuff in most slots. Most people just get a Spider Fur cloak for
back slot because it's so damn cheap. My monk, an admitted HP freak, has a
Shimmering Terror Hide Cloak (Wt 0.00. +8 AC, +4 Str, +4 Dex, +50 HP) which
is surprisingly cheap given the stats. Do a monk, back, HP search in The
Bazaar and you'll see that there's a lot of cheap stuff out there that's
surprisingly good.

> Chest:     Acrylia Reinf. Tunic     AC 14, Wt 0.7, +10 STR, +10 STA, +6
WIS

    Same as my monk. If the price on this is still too high, those Spore
Covered Tunics from Netherbian are about as good as you'll find and they're
dirt cheap (as in, you can find them on vendors cheap).

> Ear1:      Earring of Command       AC  6, Wt 0.5  +3 Str +10 HP
> Ear2:      Vah Shir Claw Earring    AC  5, Wt 0.2, +4 Sta +6 Dex

    I go for HPs, again, and have two Electrum Black Sapphire Earrings. It's
up to you - my monk's AC is in the 940's, which at his level is very good,
so I don't focus on AC but he's Iksar and has that bonus going for him. EBS
is also lighter (I use the weight elsewhere).

> Face:      Horned Beetle Mask       AC  6, Wt 0.1, +4 Str, +3 Sta, +6
magic, +6 Poison

    I go with Crystal Spider Eyes (Wt 0.00. +8 AC, +3 Wis, +3 Int, +35 HP,
+35 Mana). Acrylia Reinforced masks (Wt 0.10. +7 AC, +3 Wis, +4 Cha, +6 HP)
will likely be dirt cheap on your server from people skilling up tailoring
with them - might look into that. This is a slot you really can't mess up
too badly.

> Feet:      Acrylia Reinf. Boots     AC  9, Wt 0.7, +6 STR, +6 STA

    These are good. I have Shimmering Terror Hide Boots (Wt 2.00. +10 AC, +4
Str, +4 Agi, +4 Dex, +2 vsMg, +2 vsFire, +2 vsCold) and have been thinking
about going to Acrylia Reinforced to lose weight. I do a search for good
monk feet every time I'm in The Bazaar, and there's not much out there.

> Finger1:   Velium Fire Opal Ring    AC  6, Wt 0.1, +65 hp
> Finger2:   Velium Fire Opal Ring    AC  6, Wt 0.1, +65 hp

    Standard.

> Hands:     Silver Chitin Hand Wraps AC 10, Wt 1.0, +3 Str +3 Dex +3 Agi +3
Magic +3 Fire
> +3 Cold +3 Poison +3 Disease, Haste

    I have these too. For your purposes, it would be cheaper to go with a
FBSS for haste and use Acrylia Studded Gloves (Wt 0.40. +7 AC, +6 Str, +6
Dex) or Gem Inlaid Gauntlets (Wt 1.00. +8 AC, +3 Sta, +3 Dex) in hands.

> Head:      Crown of Froglok Kings   AC 12, Wt 0.5, +20 fire, +20 cold,
lighsource

    Ditto. The alternatives that are as good are all pretty expensive,
although if you want cheap stuff there's the Executioner's Hood (Wt 0.20. +5
AC, +4 Str, +9 Dex), Acrylia Studded Cap (Wt 0.20. +7 AC, +4 Agi, +4 Dex, +4
vsMg), and Acrylia Reinforced Skullcap (Wt 0.20. +9 AC, +4 Str, +4 Sta, +4
vsMg).

> Legs:      Acrylia Reinf. leggings  AC 10, Wt 0.9, +4 STR, +5 STA, +2 WIS

    Same as mine. Gatorscale Leggings are also pretty good here.

> Neck:      Spider Fur Collar        AC 10, Wt 0.0, +7 Str, +7 Cold, +7
Poison

    Same as mine. Ulthork Collar (Wt 0.50. +7 AC, +30 HP, -30 Mana) might be
cheaper, but I doubt it's that much cheaper.

> Shoulder:  Acrylia Reinf. Shoulders AC  8, Wt 0.4, +5 STA, +10 HP

    Same as mine. The Drolvarg Mantle used to be the standard monk
shoulders, and it's OK but it's heavy.

> Waist:     Spider Fur Belt          AC 10, Wt 0.0, +5 Agi, +5 Dex, +40 HP

    Same as mine, see hands for alternate configuration with FBSS as haste.

> Wrist1:    Steel Threaded Wrist Wrp AC  9  Wt 0.1, +3 Str, +3 Sta, +1 Dex,
+1 Fire +8 HP
> Wrist2:    Acrylia Reinf. Bracer    AC  8, Wt 0.3, +3 STR, +3 magic

    Both these are excellent bracers for a monk. My monk, because I can
tailor, has two Shaded Hide Wristbands (Wt 0.50. +12 AC, +3 Str, +3 Int, +3
vsMg, +3 vsFire, +3 vsCold, +3 vsPos, +3 vsDis) but those have a recommended
level 40 on them. Since you're a human get Symbols of Loyalty to Vox and be
happy you can get such cheap wrists. =)

> Range:     Curfang's Heart          AC  6, Wt 0.2, +3 Str, +5 Sta, +5
magic, +5 disease

    I have a Goranga Idol (Wt 0.10. +8 AC, +3 Sta, +4 Dex, +25 HP) here. The
Grail of Justice (Wt 0.50. +5 AC, +3 Str, +4 vsMg, +10 HP) is pretty cheap.

    I didn't see mention of weapons. Beg yourself a Goranga Spiked Club (Dmg
12, Dly 23. Wt 2.50. +5 AC, +2 Str) in Maiden's Eye, or have the monk camp
out beside where you're XP grinding and pick it up when one invariably
drops. It's Primary only. For offhand, a Fighting Baton or a Knuckle Duster
should both be cheap and effective. H2H weapons are horribly overpriced for
the stats/ratio, so to practice that up just use your fist. For 2HB I use a
Bamboo Bo Stick for skill practice, and a Fungus Covered Tarmok Staff (Dmg
30, Dly 45, +7 Dam:Disease. Wt 2.20. +25 vsDis) that I found on a vendor for
6 pp as a real 2HB.
