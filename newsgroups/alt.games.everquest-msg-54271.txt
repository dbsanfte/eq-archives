No trolling involved. I am simply stating an opinion that a lot of people
seem to share in. If they did not then this would not be a highly debated
subject with so many on the side of not wanting to be inspected. We all know
your stated and selfish reason for wanting to inspect as you have stated.
Like I said it shows a lot about a person that takes so many liberties.

Yes you can fart or belch but it is still considered rude to do it. =)

Same principle here. The simple fact that this causes enough players concern
should tell you that "maybe" it is not the "right" thing to do. Verant has
changed it's policy on a lot of things and I would be interested to see if
they will change their design on this. Maybe if enough players do /feedback
or post to the forums at station.everquest.com then maybe.

Yes I do have inspection notices turned off and yes I do my ability to
inspect others turned off now but "if a tree falls in a forest and no one is
there does it still make a sound". I believe it does. You do not. I have no
problem with your belief. Why do you have a problem with mine?
