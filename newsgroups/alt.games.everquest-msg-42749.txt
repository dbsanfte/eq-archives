I saw a necro duel a cleric the other day,  the necro was hard pressed to do
any damage because the cleric feared his pet repeatedly and interrupted his
casting with stuns.  This wasn't a serious duel (it was between friends and
no one was killed), but I suspsect that if it had been serious the cleric
would have wiped the floor with the necro.
