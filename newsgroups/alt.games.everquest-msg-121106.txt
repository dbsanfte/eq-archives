From what I can understand, Verant disabled all versions of the Tutorial
specifically to prevent folks from using Mr. Stembler's program.

Last few times I attempted to play with the Tutorial 'for old times sake,'
it didn't work.  Some error messages about 'a device attached to the
software not working' and 'file is linked to a missing export
MSS32DLL..blahblahblah.'

Snooping around Sony's EQ boards, I seem to recall reading some vague
reference to it being disabled to prevent folk from using '3rd party
software to explore zones offline.'
