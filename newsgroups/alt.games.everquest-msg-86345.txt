    I was out looking for a hunting spot in DL to pl a warrior with a friend
one night. We decided that the main areas were too camped (KC spawns) so we
decided to move away from there. We went to one of the brute caves I think
it was. As we were running there lev'd I said "I wonder if Gore is out and
about tonight". My friend laughs and says.. "no she never comes this way.".

    I am sure you can fill in the blanks here...
