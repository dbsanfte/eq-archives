True.  Also, the concept of quests means that there's not as much instant
gratification in EQ (compared to UT or Quake).  Could be that's one reason
why UT and Quake are overrun with kewlkidz.  Just a thought.

Heck, last night I was standing by the POD lift when someone started
chatting with me.  Before long, I realized we'd been chatting for anout 30
minutes about realtively non-game related stuff.  Frankly, that was as much
fun as running around splatting orcs.  It was a different kind of fun, if
you know what I mean, but things like that are definitely a part of what
keeps me coming back.
