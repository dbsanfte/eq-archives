By the same token the firearm murder rate in NYC (which also has very
restrictive handgun purchase laws) is much, much lower than it was in
1977.  So please don't be drawing conclusions on the effect of the
laws based on an obviously disfunctional city.  Washington DC is also
the same city that returned Marion Barry to office after having him
caught on tape smoking crack with a prostitute.  Hell, DC is fucked up
enough that you can use that as an example of why democracy is a bad
idea.
