So if I want a crowd, I should go for one of the races with an obvious
choice (i.e. wood elf, halfing, troll)?

Sounds like I just picked poorly for my first try.  I'll go try a human
bard or something and see how Freeport's hopping.  I know that FV will
have -less- people than other servers, but you need -some- people to RP.
The NPCs don't care if I hail them in 1337sp33k or not.
