1) As I pointed out he's nearing the end of easy soloing for a Warrior
at L28 already.  He's not likely to reach "raid ready" levels without
grouping.
2) The OP was asking about _both_ group and solo opportunities.

I think my other posts to the thread have covered all this.

Either you guys were incapable of communicating simple concepts, or
you were dealing with a sub-chimp level intellect.  Either is a sure
recipe for disaster no matter what classes are involved.

There is no reason to dump on a L28 who likes to solo some of the
time.  Let him have his fun.  Don't project the failures of your
past onto his present.  He's a long ways from raiding and the
attitude his post shows suggests that he'll do fine in most any
in-game situation.  Whatever troubles he has will be learning
experiences, he's just not likely to be in any way comparable to
your retarded chimp example.
