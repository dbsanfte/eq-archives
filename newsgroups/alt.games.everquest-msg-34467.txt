Not sure if making a deal and not following through would come under the
anti scamming provisions. My story anyway.

Was hanging out by the Saucer and saw someone killing fish. Told them I
would pay them to kill one for me. They killed one with their fish mule,
came back with their main. I Iooted the fish, turned it in for a The Band of
RL, paid his main 20 pp.

Everyone was happy with the deal. I didn't have a free slot for a fish mule,
20 pp was a good price for the ring.

I think there is one other way other then the regurgatonic to get the fish
or taking a chance on the barbarians in the fishing village from going
aggresso. Something like using the wolf<Frostbite?> to track down someone to
get them away from the barbarian camp then killing him. Not sure how
involved it would be, never done the quest.
