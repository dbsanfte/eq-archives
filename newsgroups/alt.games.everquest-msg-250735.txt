For AO, my recollection from listening to the people I knew who tried it (I
didn't) was that nearly everyone thought it was a great game, but that it
was massively buggy.  Hence, the predictions of likely failure.

Of the people I know from MMORPGs, both from real life and from my EQ guild,
I see a lot of people now moving back and forth between games.  They try the
new games when they come out, and then go back to their "main" game.  But
then they come back to the other games.  E.g., pretty much everyone I know
tried DAoC, and most eventually came back to EQ.  And a good number of those
eventually then stopped EQ and had a second run at DAoC.

I think we'll end up with a half-dozen or so strong MMORPGs with a fair
number of people bouncing around between them.
