Seriously, Graeme, or are you exaggurating with a bit of manly barbarian
pride?  I could see 1950 heal +75% slow > 2950 heal, but in terms of pure
mana efficiency and power...4680 heal as well?  *looks a bit dubious but
still open minded*

For that matter, how often do you actually get a 75% slow in PoP these
days?  Or is the mitigation not as common as it was made out to be?

(I still haven't hunted yet in PoP, you see...computers couldn't handle it
before, and I haven't wanted to start until I was confident I knew how to
play my class again. )
