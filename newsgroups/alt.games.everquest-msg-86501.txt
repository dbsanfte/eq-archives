I think it is something we all should be getting, since even in beta Verant
said that the $10 a month would be for support, updates and all that other
stuff.  Now they say to get all that we gotta toss them $30 more.
Think it'd be a better idea to up the cost from $10 a month to $15-20 and
allow Legends idea be on all servers, heck now a days MMORPG's cost $13-15 a
month anyway.
