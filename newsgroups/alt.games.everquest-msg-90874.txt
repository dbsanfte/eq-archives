That's SUPPOSE to be one of the weak points for the class though.  And
it's really not all the big a deal.  And most of those weaknesses can
be mitigated through the use of things like SoW potions and/or gear.

of Velious, and I can't count the number of times he's died on one
hand.  It just requires some patience and planning.
