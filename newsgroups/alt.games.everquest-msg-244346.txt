I have my main Aru, and between 2 accounts I have 1 of all 16 classes.

I have been chipping away in the mornings on my alts under 30 ... 
yesterday got my baby chanter to 20 =) I work on my main, my berserker 
and my ranger when my game husband is online with me. When I get all my 
baby alts to 30, then I will concentrate on getting them one at a time 
to 60. I figure my main and 2 main alts will get to 60 without any 
special work on them in the course of regular playtime=)

I set up my warrior as my trademule in bazaar because I really dont like 
playing her, so she isnt really getting played=) but I do have her=)
