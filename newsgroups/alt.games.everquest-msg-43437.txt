    Verant considers all the mobs that, when killed, give BN hits to be
bugged. According to them nobody should have BN less than indifferent, and
they will reset the faction. I agree with you - there are ways to get the
faction back, so make it a real faction like the rest. But VI disagrees.

    As a side note to that, I remember one of the first people to try and
solve the original Vox Tail Ale portion of the Warrior's Epic couldn't do
one step because he had somehow borked his BN faction, so he didn't feel
what he did was the right step and someone else solved it before him. Was
that the infamous Thogg that had that happen to him? He's lucky he didn't do
it, anyways - finding out that there was a long quest for Vox Tail Ale that
involved killing Faydedar AFTER Vox Tail Ale was put on a ton of vendors
must have been a massive letdown.
