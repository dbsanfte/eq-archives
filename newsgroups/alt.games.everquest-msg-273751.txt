Right, no need for antagonism. My points are nothing more than my own 
observations and opinion. To someone who favors WoW over EQ2 my comment 
about Pepsi vs. Bordeaux is not going to go over well, but that's how I see 
it. I tried to come up with a way of communicating my personal sense of 
great satisfaction from both, while recognizing that both satisfy something 
different. If you worked for Pepsi, you'd take great pride in that comment 
... Thanks for showing some restraint, though, it's one of reasons I prefer 
to post here rather than c.s.i.p.c.r.!

That's a fair point, I wouldn't argue against it. I don't know about selling 
it short, I've been exposed to both the WC lore and EQ lore since the 
beginning and throughout all of their lifecycles, so I'm aware that there's 
a body of lore there supporting both. I just come out feeling that there's 
more depth and continuity in the EQ world than the world of Azeroth. It 
won't surprise me to find that there are other views on this. ;-)

I agree that Vanguard is going to hit EQ2 harder than WoW because both games 
appeal to the kind of gamer who seek significant challenge and depth from 
their MMOG. Blizzard is interesting because they make both types of games. 
Starcraft and Warcraft appeal to many hardcore gamers looking for serious, 
challenging play (just look at the Korean obsession with Starcraft and the 
competitive ladders for both RTS's). And then look at Diablo, one of the 
most fun games I've ever played, but not anywhere in the same league when it 
comes to challenging game play. With WoW, Blizzard seems to have taken the 
Diablo approach: fun as hell, easy as hell. The only real challenge I've 
seen in this game that taps into significant player skills is the PvP game, 
where only the best will be able to consistently dominate. Other than that, 
it's probably the easiest MMOG I've ever seen in terms of just surviving and 
leveling up. The biggest challenge I see between me and level 60 is my 
ability to schedule game time. The goal in EQ2 is different, it's always 
been about the gear, and the primary obstacles standing between me and 
attainment of the many tantalizing items dangling out in front of me, are 
quests that are challenging to approach, to figure out and to execute 
against. The vast majority of our guild's organized activities revolve 
around figuring out how to execute against the many Heritage quests that 
will yield up the goodies we drool for.

I understand your comment about EQ2 and grouping, that's a well-known bias 
of the EverQuest universe with upsides and downsides. I've gone both ways on 
the point, initially leaving EQ because of it and then returning to it after 
experiencing the alternative. But grinding? Oh, come on.  In EQ2 I never, 
ever feel the need to grind. I spend 100% of my game time doing quests and 
*almost* incidentally killing things along the way. I can't remember ever 
feeling the need to grind monsters simply for experience. I'm sure some 
players do, but I don't see them here. WoW promotes grinding pretty openly 
because the goal in WoW has always been to level. This makes sense for the 
PvP game where levels will be mandatory, but I'm not sure what's going to 
happen to the players who hit 60 on non PvP servers. What will be left for 
them?  Blizzard has always openly promoted leveling as the goal. Even in 
beta they had a contest where the winner was determined by who hit the 
highest level during the period! There's your formula for promoting 
grinding. Fortunately, the combat mechanics of WoW are so damned fun that 
grinding isn't so bad. I love playing my wife's Rogue character, it's 
clearly more fun than playing her EQ2 Rogue, big kudos to Blizzard for once 
again doing what they do best: making it fun. Don't sell that short. :P
