Your logic: yes. Your logic was consistent. 

Your assertion that raiders, the group you are in, actually make up the 
majority of the playerbase, seems to defy reality though. Even generous 
estimates of active raiders to active casual accounts leaves you 
outnumbered 2 to 1. 

But that's another thread...literally. :)

To the OP: No he's simply not being rewarded for accomplishing NOTHING 
worth rewarding.

Oooooh you a beat 20th level challenge at 50th level... 

No prize for you! Get over it. 

In a similiar vein: I make a big deal out of it when my daughter "goes 
potty" on her own, and even give her treats. My wife on the other hand 
gets nothing for her efforts in that regard. You apparently call that, 
in your own words: "punishing her for having accomplished something"? 

(lmao... just the idea is cracking me up... )
