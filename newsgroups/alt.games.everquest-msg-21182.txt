I was in a group that could best be described as an incinerator two
nights ago. Druid(me), monk puller, enchanter, mage, necro, wizard.
(Was unforunately forced to leave when a thunderstorm hit, we were
rocking) I had another group last week with two wizards, another group
with every flavor of caster except cleric ...and now tank heavy groups
feel sluggish by comparison :)
