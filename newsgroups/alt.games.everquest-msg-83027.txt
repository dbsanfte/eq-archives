Ah, yes.  I remember petitioning that lame-ass name.  I believe I was on 
the N. Ro. Plat at the time and you were pulling Spiders, and screaming for 
help when they got the best of you.  Saved your ass then reported your 
name.  I should have skipped the former, but I'm an all around helpful guy.

Unless that -wasn't- you, but how many other halflings have that name?  
Probably none, now =)

If you want to get me back, report my Necro's name "Pheilmi".  Tell that 
that it sounds like "Feel Me" and it's offensive to you.  I've been wanting 
to get that changed for a while, now.

kicksyaindachips = clever.  For a 6-year old, maybe.  4-year old, probably.
