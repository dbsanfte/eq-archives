This problem used to come and go for me when I used ICS. One patch its be
fine, next time no go, had to resort to direct dial and copy much like you
have said. Well, cable finally arrived and I went with a router, sine then
its worked but there is some kind of bug with EQ and ICS since the original.
Wish I had an answer but just wanted to let you know yer not the only one
that has seen this. :) best of luck
