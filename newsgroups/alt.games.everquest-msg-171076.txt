Well, he was.  His interpretation of the Bible was somewhat unusual, but 
he did acknowledge Christ as an anointed one.  Next you'll tell me the 
Amish aren't Christian. :)

}Christians.  I want him to give me an example of that, because as far as 
}I've ever seen or heard, Christianity is very much favored in the US as 
}far as the 1st Amendment goes.

The violation technicaly fell under the 2nd amendment (and some others), 
but I think the primary basis for the breach was disrespecting their 
rights, protected by the first amendment, to practice the religion of 
their choice without federal interference.

I think it's the closest to a legitimate example you will get. :)
