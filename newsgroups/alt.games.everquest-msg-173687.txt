The Gflux+CoTH is how we did most of our CoM stuff.

go next to the house with the goos, gflux the
unlevitated mage, and he r- clicks a lev ring at the
top of his arc, then just walks to the spire on
the roof, invises, and runs to the ramp.  The rest
of the party can pull the 2 wandering goos off the
ramp, then the mage CoH's the raid up - take out
the first house, and GFlux the mage to the top of
the 2nd house, where he CoH's again.

We have succeeded in pulling the reaver to the ground
before - but it's not easy.

The mage piece isn't triggered - just a random drop
off Neh.
