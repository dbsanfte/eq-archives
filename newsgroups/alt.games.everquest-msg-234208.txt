Because, the post the paranoia comes from had absolutely no sources
to back it up. It more or less rambled on about every possible
exploit/bug theory that anyone has ever thought might happen.
Basically they did the equivilent of saying the moon landing was
faked, "because it was faked! I KNOW IT!"
If you are going to say the moon landing was faked, you have to back
it up. This is the same thing.

The fact that it was typed by someone who likely has not graduated
from grammar school yet made it more unbeliveable. It looked like it
came from some poorly educated person who has an axe to grind,
possibly because they got caught cheating in some way.
