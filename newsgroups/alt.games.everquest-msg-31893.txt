Fear kiting is a very effective way to hunt.  However, your
fear is restricted to animals.  While your snare is more than
adequate (not something I can say about SKs) your fear
isn't all that good, and really restricts the mobs you can
fight in variety... and in loot.

Partner with a cleric of several levels lower than your own;
you'll get a much better fear that works on any mob you want
to go after.  As a cleric, my favorite partner class is a ranger;
particularly after level 30, they can -find- the mobs, bring em
back snared, and do outrageous damage to em once I fear
em.  Course they are made of tissue paper when it comes
to getting beat on, but between a cleric and a ranger, we
have plenty of spells to prevent that from happening in any
outdoor situation.

I fought side by side solo with a 45 ranger for a half hour
in COM at level 39, then partnered up with him for
another half hour.  Body count:  First half hour, ranger
three, cleric three.  Second half hour: thirty kills for
the partnership.  Because of the level discrepency, I
got only about three times as much exp as I did solo,
while he got about 6 times as much.  We also each got
five times the loot we would have soloing.  (this is a funny
situation, mind you, not an ideal place for a ranger to
hunt since the prey wasn't animals, and one where a
cleric could solo effectively by selectively picking on
undead... in a "normal" situation, we'd have seen the
starting lineup run more like "ranger, 9, cleric 1"...
but the partnership would still chop 30)

Many people thing "Full Group" or "Solo" are the only
choices, but very often you'll find that "Partner" or "Trio"
are the most effective choices out there.

If you are working strictly on animals anyway, try partnering
with a rogue.  He'll do -astounding- amounts of damage,
you should easily go thru mobs in less than a quarter the time
you'd do it solo... and in less than an eighth of the time
he'd do solo (if he can manage it at all, solo, since his damage
output (with the exception of BS) is lower than a rangers, and
he has no way to avoid the pounding like you do.

Cleric/Ranger/Rogue -really- chews up the scenery.
