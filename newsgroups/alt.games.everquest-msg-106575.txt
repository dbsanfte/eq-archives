Okay, first of all, I agree with you to a point.
I rarely use /ooc (like I said, only if I have an "out of character"
question that's not gonna end up in a friggen argument/discussion/etc... I
use my /guild for that.), but when I do, I like to keep it short.
I agree that it's a friggen pain in the ass to have sixty conversations
screaming down your chat window... but in that case, I take the initiative
and either watch closely for purple text (/tell), or turn that channel off
entirely.  Hopefully, if there's a HG standing behind me, whoever wants to
alarm me has the common sense to use /tell instead of /ooc.  If not... oh
well, dumb of me for not paying attention anyhow or sitting in a bad place.

I'm not looking for an argument or trying to stir anything up... just my
2cp.
