My level 3 (now closer to 7 in a very short timespan) gnome SK had a
blast with the skellies near Ak'anon. Kill one with the help of
harmtouch, die to the next, kill another, die to the next, kill two
without dying... haven't had that much fun in EQ in forever. If I'd
bothered to upgrade my directX and graphic drivers, she's the one I
would have been playing this week.
Oh, and she also has the 2hb, earring and bow from what others left
behind :)
