Are there any useful pages on the current tribute system? When i search on
it, either i find pages full of the pre-nerf values, or just pages full of
"GoD tribute nerf suxors" posts.

I was really hoping to find a decent way to get some of these points as I
bought the expansion, and apart from the tradeskills zone there doesn't seem
much in it that's useful to me. :P
