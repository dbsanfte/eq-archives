Atlas was a new feature added about a year ago.  The in game map has 2
tabs, one showing map of the zone and other showing Norrath, Loclin, 2
parts of Planes, etc and you can click on it to get detailed area
showing zone connection lines.  Click on the zones and you can view
the zone.

It has been useful when I had to help a lost soul half a world away
without having to be in the zone or using z printout.  Also no more
guessing how to get from zone X to zone Y.
