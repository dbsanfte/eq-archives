It's a good hook. It's what I'm after...

There was a post about goals on the beta board... let me dig it up... (note
when he refers to a 'dungeon' he's talking about the static
caves/fortresses)

 For years now the developers have given the cryptic answer "To Live in the
Star Wars Universe". Many people get this and have wanted to do just that
for well over 20 years. However "Living" in the universe is too vague for
some gamers (heck, most people don't quite understand what the "point" of
living in the real world is - I'll give you a hint "to be good to one
another").
So for the goal minded folks out there, here is the "Point" of playing SWG:

1) Learn the basics of the game for a while so you don't appear to be a
newbie.
2) Accomplish all the different types of missions, from the quick and
straight forward Mission Terminals to the multi-legged and more varied NPC
static quests. You may need to travel beyond your starting city to find the
more involved ones.
3) Gain enough money to buy (or gain enough skill to make) a good weapon and
other equipment that suits your character.
4) Finish a themepark such as getting all the way to Jabba's Throne Room.
Beat at least 1 "dungeon" on every planet.
5) By doing factional missions or joining battlefields, gain enough faction
points to rise up through the ranks in the Empire or Rebellion. Make enough
points to try out all of the perks.
6) Join a Player Association that fits your play-style. Help others members
to accomplish their unique goals and they will help you with yours.
7) Keep tabs on your Badges. You want to get over 100 of these to consider
yourself a success in SWG.
8) Spend all of your skill points to master several professions. (Be sure
you surrender some skills and learn new ones to find the character
combination best for you)
9) Search the galaxy to find the spot you want to call home and build a
house there so you can leave your mark on that galaxy. (Be sure to furnish
it as an empty house doesn't count)
10) When you are done with all that, work on figuring out how to unlock the
Force Sensitive slot. If you can do that (and very few of you will and it
will take several months, at least), then repeat the process with your new
Jedi character until you are able to get the Jedi Master title.

When you have accomplished these 10 not-so-easy steps, you can say you have
"won" the game". There you have it. But please note, this list is subject to
change as we add new content such as player cities, player vehicles, more
quests, and full expansions.

Now, of course, feel free to substitute any of the above with other
activities you enjoy in the game, such as becoming a famous entertainer,
well-sought after crafter, always in demand doctor or highly feared bounty
hunter. Or just have fun exploring, fishing, dueling, getting married,
attending parties, meeting new people, helping people stuck in step one or
even hosting your own events for each other. Definitely try to Role Play (it
isn't hard, you don't have to act goofy, just don't bring real world
conversation into the spatial chat).
