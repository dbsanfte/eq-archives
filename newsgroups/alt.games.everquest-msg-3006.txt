As I understand it there is a boat for good races,which leaves from
Butcherblock and boat for evil races which leaves from the Oasis.

     I am a level 25 paladin human, I am currently in the Oasis of Marr and
would like to try this way if possible

        have read you can take the raft to Ogre island in Timouros Deep and
then swim  east and catch the boat to the Kunark Mainland.   I have the map,
but it is not clear how risky and how difficult this is to accomplish.

      My question for experienced travelers is... Just how risky and
difficult is this? or would you just reccomned taking the long way around by
traveling from the Oaisis to Freport, then to Butcherblock and then to the
Kunark mainland?

    If you have used the the Oasis route as a good race character, do you
have more precise instructions.
