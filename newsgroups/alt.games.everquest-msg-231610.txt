Here's my list of 'Things That Don't Stay on Trader Very
Long':

A vial of prismatic dye - 40plat to 100plat per vial, with
most pricing between 40 and 50.

Swirling shadows - 50plat/each

Any dye/temper/tannin - 50plat and above. At 50plat, dyes will
sell out almost immediately. Tempers and tannins vary more in
pricing and how fast they sell, but still can't seem to keep
any in stock for more than a day or two.

Celestial essences - At 5plat/each, these go quickly, too.

Class 2 Steel Point Arrows - When fletching for skillups, I
would place stacks of these on my trader at 1plat or 1plat5gold
and would also sell out quickly.

Rallic packs - 750plat to 850plat
