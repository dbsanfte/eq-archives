well everything back to normal again today i have noticed that the
build version on the game has changed from 1.6.1 to 1.7.1 seems to
have corrected the issue lets put it down to gates of discord messing
up some peoples systems and now they have ironed out my bug although
it took them a while and they wont admit shiiiiitttt!!

hope you have your prob fixed to george.
