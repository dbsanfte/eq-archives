/disagree

Blue stuff gets harder as you move up.  Most stuff I fight solo now 
leaves me with a *lot* of downtime.

<nitpick> But what if you're a guildie who solos?  All my characters are 
in a guild, but I've never grouped with anybody *in* the guild.  I've 
seen a few do it but it's not something we go out of the way to do.  
Granted, we're a very *small* guild, but since we're in an alliance of 
guilds, any raids that happen, higher levels are likely to be invited in 
on.</nitpick>

That much, I can agree with.  Which is why occasionally, when I'm not 
trying to find a new way to make money so I can up my tailoring, I still 
look for a group :)
