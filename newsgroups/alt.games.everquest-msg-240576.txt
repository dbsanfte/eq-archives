}best soloer of:
}druid, necro, bard?

Define 'best'...

Assuming a person who knows their class inside out and backwards, and is 
willing to devote full attention to what they're doing:

1) bard
2) druid
3) necro

Assuming a lazy putz like me, where best means "most soloable while 
watching Law & Order" :

1) necro
2) druid
3) bard

}best pet?
}necro v. mage in a dual?

If it's just pet vs. pet, my money's on the mage, but I think it would 
depend very much on what level the necro and mage are, and which pet the 
mage chooses.  If the pets' owners are allowed to help, my money's on the 
necro.
