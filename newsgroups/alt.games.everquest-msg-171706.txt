Lots of people may not realize this, but you can get skillups in
research from training at your guild beyond 21, unlike other
tradeskills.  Since there isn't a whole lot to spend points on past
specialization, it's feasible.  My necro's around 65 skill, and I'd
say at least 35 of the last 40 points have come from necro
guildmasters rather than in practice skillups.

HTH,
