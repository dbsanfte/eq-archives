As the other people said, that is the point. There IS NO LORE ONES. SO
since there are no lore ones, there are no "Pre-Nerf" since there was
no "nerf." 

Some people in my guild had trouble grasping this when we were
explaining it also,

"But when you saw them in the trade window you'd know that they were
LORE, so only dumb people would be scammed!"

"no, thats not what we are saying, there IS NO LORE ONE.. the scam is
that there is a lore one so these non lore ones are worth more"

"yeah but like I said, you can just see in the trade window that they
are lore so the person is lying.."

"NO, THERE IS NO LORE ONE SEE>.. !!%&#*( !"
