Worst anyone can say about Kerry is that he Might be a disaster... we 
already know Bush II -is- one.  I'd vote Bush I over Bush II... he was a 
little clueless but he wasn't -bad-, his son on the other hand is not 
only bad, but every time we turn around we discover that he is worse 
than we thought, but has been lying to cover that up.

I never thought I'd be nostalgic about lying over oral sex with 
interns... but compared to killing and maiming tens of thousands of 
people (thousands of them Americans) and lying about why, well it seems 
positively saintly.

Thus my wistful wishing Carter was a realistic choice.  Man, if there's 
anyone on the planet who fits your bill, he's it eh?

Best ex president we've ever had... Might the intervening 25 years have 
turned him into a potential great president as well?  I guess we'll 
never know, because I can't imagine him running, heck, he might not even 
be around in 4 more years.
