I copied this from a prvious post to this newsgroup:

Druids can have up to 6 dots going at once, but they
must be of different types:


Type 1, pre-50 fire dots:

 1  Flame Lick AC -4, 24 damage in 8 ticks for 10 mana
 29 Immolate AC -18, 240 damage in 10 ticks for 120 mana

Type 2, pre-50 magic dots (swarm line):

 14 Stinging Swarm 117 damage in 9 ticks for 65 mana
 24 Creeping Crud 210 damage in 10 ticks for 100 mana
 34 Drones of Doom 340 damage in 10 ticks for 141 mana << ES vambraces 8 second cast
 44 Drifting Death 650 damage in 10 ticks for 200 mana

Elder Spiritists Vambraces:

Type 3, post-50 fire dot:

 52 Breath of Ro AC -21, Fire -31, 920 damage in 10 ticks for 250 mana

Type 4, post-50 magic dot:

 53 Winged Death 1287 damage in 9 ticks 350 mana

Type 5, epic Nature Walkers Scimitar:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3571

 Wrath of Nature snare 60%, 1650 damage in 30 ticks, Instant cast

Type 6, Sporecaller:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10569

 Choking Spores 570 damage in 10 ticks

Shaman and necro dots will stack with most of these (necro dot/snares
including their epic will overwrite our epic, not sure about sporecaller
effect's stackability)
