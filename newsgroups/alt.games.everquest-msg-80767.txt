Oooooo... good points on both accounts. (How early was that post? Can I
use the coffee excuse?) Yes, definitely taking my advice and *admitting*
to a GM that you are sharing your account, even with your son, would be
monumentally stupid. Forget I said it and consider me summarily flogged
with a wet noodle.

As to 'time to let him take responsibility for his own actions' well,
yes. Also true. I guess I was feeling an uncharacteristic overlfow of
kindness at the moment, but in normal mode I have to agree. "You broke
your toy in a temper tantrum? Ok. No problem. Go mow some lawns till you
have enough money for a new one and come see me."

But as to Biz's (snipped) point about logging........ YES. Keep logging
off at all times, and if you find sections of time where logging was
turned off and you know the kid was online, ask questions immediately. 
I can only picture the horror of going to log on after work and finding
yourself naked at your bind point and your corpse having fifteen minutes
left on the rez clock twenty zones away.
"Where's JOHNNY??!!!??"
Hrmmm.... he seems to have left the house for a while.
