OK after all the bull shit nerfing and changes in game how do you feel
about it all.

Sales of POP are not what they (Sony) thought they would be.
People leaving because they can't solo any more.
Nerf this and nerf that.
But yet they are a few thing that do work.
So what's your take on it....

Is this the beginning of the end or the start of a new game.
