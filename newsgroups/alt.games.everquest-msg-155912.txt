What makes a rogue?  I think it's either the insatiable need to see 
what's behind door number one AND door number 2, or the compultion (sp?) 
to lend a weary travel a hand carrying his/her extracoinage and loot.  
Then again, maybe that's just my justification for our (rogue's) actions.  

Uh, did I ramble?

Balanof, 20 (AND A HALF!) rogue, E'Ci
