Issues involved are...
something about textures for every zone.

also, the workaround discussed talks about the
'advanced' tab.........well.........
my 'advanced' tab is 'grayed-out'...wtf

I wanted to post to their tech board, but I got tired
of trying to get past their  graphics, javascript, etc , etc, so I posted here.
Perhaps their site does not like Zonealarm.

All comments welcome.
Happy Patching
Tequila
