It goes even deeper than that too in the case of publicly traded companies 
that have to report to a board of directors or even in the case of private 
companies that are funded by VC.  In these cases the word is that (and this 
is an example), that we will spend 6 million on developing and marketing 
this product.  We expect return no later than X date.  In those cases the 
pressures of the sales department, marketing department, and every other 
department but QA and development is saying we go on this date 
regardless...
