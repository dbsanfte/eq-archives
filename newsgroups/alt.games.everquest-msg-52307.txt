This would be a valid argument.  Almost irrefutable given all the facts.

That's the point.  Valuable to whom?  You?  Fine.  Then to you, that was
money well spent.  Valuable to me?  No way.  It's worthless to me.  So, I
could call you an idiot, and by your line of reasoning, I would be right.

Your time exists and if that time is enjoyed more because of the money you
spent then that is generally considered money well spent.  The same could be
said for any time consuming form of entertainment.  After a play or a
symphony you don't have anything to show, but you did enjoy the time you
spent.  If you spend more money for better seats and thereby enjoy the
performance more then that is money well spent too.  It doesn't make you an
idiot for spending more money to see the same show.

Jeopardising "my" future enjoyment?  Again you impose your standards of
enjoyment on others.  A person's ability to enjoy a game in ways in which
you do not does not reflect a deficiancy in their intellect.

Now, if you are refering to the overall detriment to the game as in economic
saturation, well this is a valid point to a seller, but not to a buyer.  It
is not an EQ customer's responsibility to study and comprehend the
intricacies involved in a video game's economics such that they are aware of
the detriment they might cause to the game if they buy some extra platinum
pieces.  Being unaware of these detriments, or even not caring does not
reflect an  IQ of less than 25 which is, by definition, what an idiot is.
In fact, I'll wager that there are a number of EQ players who are aware that
buying platinum pieces is against the rules, who are aware of the reasons
why, and who don't care, yet still have IQs higher than yours and mine.

A great many people of respectable intellect thoroghly enjoy doing these
things.  You still seem to be unable to accept the fact that many people
enjoy things in ways that you do not.

Why does it annoy you?  What position?  EQ isn't a competition between the
players to see who has the best equipment.  Some of players have made it out
to be, and that is fine, but it is not that way by design.  If this game, to
you, is a measure of social status reflected by the equipment your character
wears, and you are annoyed that other players have an advantage over you in
this regard, then it sounds as if this annoyance you feel is a personal
issue.  It has no bearing on the idiocy of another player.

agreed

> Play it as intended or not at all is my advice.

I do not find this to be sound advice.  I once read a post by a member of VI
(I apologize I can not remember who) detailing the many aspects of the game
that have evolved due to players playing the game in ways that were not
intended by the designers.

I realize that by saying "Play it as intended" you mean "Don't break the
rules".  However, many people do not agree with the rules, and my point when
I entered this thread was that though Lokari may agree with the rules and
disagree with these players, to point a finger at them and simply call them
"idiots" without even stating a basis for her argument is very childish and,
I feel, beneath her.

 You don't know if these items will mean anything to "me" or not.  You don't
know what does and does not satisfy the "hankering" of another player.
Obviously it is pointless and self-defeating to you, and that is why you
don't do it.

The term "idiot" has become trite and it has degraded, to many people who
are of limited vocabulary and debate tactics, to simply mean that "I don't
agree with you".  It is used as an attack on a person by insulting their
intelligence.  However, what I find ironic is when I observe a debate as a
third party, it is generally the one of less intellect and whose argument is
less sound who resorts to the term.  It was once part of a classification
system that I don't think is even still in use, but the term is still
flagrantly thrown around by people who don't feel that their argument can
stand on its own and feel it gives them some added advantage to attack their
advesary in a debate.
