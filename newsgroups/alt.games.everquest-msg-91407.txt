Don't worry Biz, it 's is not just your own opinion and ego I consider
irrellevent but also my own. My moniker changes whenever I have to reset up
OE or build a new main. My last here was Arakai I beleive. I have been
following this NG off and on since inception, and even had the displeasure
of your ascetic company on the RCGUO beforehand.

Not that that means squatt anyhow - well, only to the wank "I am a regular"
crowd.

Either your newsfeed is fubar'ed or it is something a bit closer to home. If
your going to get bogged down in pedantics and/or looking up crap at google
at least do it right. Of course _why_ you feel compelled to perform such
pedantics is another question. Anyway -  it is you time so you can do
whatever you want with it, anything that keeps little Ron out of public
toilets and childrens playgrounds is a worthy enterprise I guess....

Like I said, 95% percent of the trees in this forest is only good for
woodchipping. I don't put myself in a different basket than anyone else...
