To me, Palindrome's post merely points out that Schadenfreude's claim
that traffic is down in this newsgroup because people have moved to
online forums is false.  I'm not seeing any reference to one game
being better or cooler than another.

*Your* post, otoh, shows a pretty deep-seated insecurity about playing
EQ.  You need to just relax and enjoy your choice of MMO and not worry
about whether it's the most popular one or not.
