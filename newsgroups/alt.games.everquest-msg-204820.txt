Definitely my recommendation as well.  I have heard of mages reporting 
that it has worked for them since the changes, but I also know from 
personal experience with 3, yes 3, mages with fire pets that it can fail 
miserably as well.  My last guild has done the encounter successfully 
several times, using two clerics, and two tanks(61+ 
SK/Paladin/Warrior/Ranger), anything beyond that was just gravy.
