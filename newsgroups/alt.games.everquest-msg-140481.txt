First i tried their "move these newly changed files to your UI dir".
Thought that was odd because i never changed any of the files they 
listed and supposedly if they are not in the UI dir the game reverts to 
the default for those files.

didn't help.

Then went to the ui_charname.ini for that char and switched to use default.

didn't help

any guesses?
