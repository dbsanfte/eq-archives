Hi all,

In a group last night I was hesitant to root mobs with my 37 cleric , using
instill (L19), because the sucess rate I had with it on similar mobs (dark
blue con) in the area was low. One of my group mates suggested using the
lower level root spell instead, following which I had almost a 100% root
rate (albeit for less time). Was the previous failure rate just bad luck or
is there a significant difference in the ability of mobs to resist these
spells? I assumed that a low level root spell would have less chance of
success against a  higher level mob.

Thanks,

Andrew
