    It was a complete surprise to me when I realized I was done.  I had
finally found a class that was my main, after about oh, two years of alting
around.  I had finally gotten her to a (much) higher level than I had
gotten any other character.  I was beginning to go on raids, and get decent
equipment.  And then I realized that I didn't really like raiding, and
wasn't too hot on the higher end content in general.  And, I was sick to
death of the lower end stuff.  I thought I just needed a break.  It took
quite a while before it actually sank in that I was completely done.

  Same here, of course.  But I admit, it does feel sorta wrong to stay
active in a newsgroup that devoted to a subject that I have no active stake
in.  I was active in usenet for a few years before I entered the AGE scene,
but even now that I've stopped playing EQ I've had little desire to return
to my old haunts.  Maybe as more and more old timers move on to other
things I'll feel like leaving, but right now I can't see that happening,
nor do I look forward to when the day does come.  I don't want to have to
find a new home!

   I should have given my stuff away.  Lenny stripped down everything he
was interested in saving (including Gumdrop!) but there was still quite a
bit of fairly nice mid end cleric stuff.  Now, its as if I had destroyed it
all.
