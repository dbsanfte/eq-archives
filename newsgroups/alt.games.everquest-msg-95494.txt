I have to agree with this statement...  I have this little thing
called -pride- that prevents me from going up to someone I don't even know,
and asking for hand-outs...  I remember when I first started playing this
game with my Druid over a year ago...  Here I am, in Qeynos, lev 3, killing
rats, and snakes and such... someone just up and gives me a velium
scimitar...  Granted, it takes forever for the effect to proc, but still, it
helped me quite a bit, especially when I got to around lev 11, and began
hunting wisps...

Point of it is, you tend to get gifts when you are looking like you are
trying to fend for yourself... going up to a stranger, and begging,
generally horks people off... :)
