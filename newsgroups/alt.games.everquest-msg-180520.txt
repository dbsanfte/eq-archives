Is there anyway to spend your AA points and NOT get the title - Ive been a
single single named character - no last name and never wanted one - been
Cladari for over 3 years on Q server and want to stay that way.

But when I invest my AA points Im going to get that dumb (to me) title - is
there any way to avoid it ?
