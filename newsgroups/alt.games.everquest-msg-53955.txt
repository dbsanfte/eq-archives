I'm thinking no on both, unless you mean 60 as in a number of 60
necros farming vox which is possible ;) A single 60 necro? No.

What I heard about the WW dragon was a 60 warrior and a cleric with
the pernerf cleric BP DUOING it. That one very good equipment tank was
enough with the cleric doing the complete heal on the bp when it
could.

Any single character can't, they'd beat down too fast in melee and
summoned etc.
