He better hurry and killfile himself then, since unless this is a newsgroup in
killfiling, he just posted off topic...

Oh wow.... I didn't even notice that when I skimmed his message ;)   Hilarous.
He actually went through with it and complained to mindspring, and they told
him he was a twit and should get bent. ;)  (and then he was stupid enough to
come here and share his humiliation with us all)

Almost as funny as the whole Avenger publicly getting dropped by his posting
service thing.... but I don't think anything could really top that.
