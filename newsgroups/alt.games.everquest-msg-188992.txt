if u got a friend with eq, try copying his everquest.exe file onto a cd and
copying it to your system, if that doesn't work, then there is 1 file which
prompts the download of the expansions on the patch select screen. I'm not
sure which file, if it isn't everquest.exe, but im sure some of the
smart-arses here do.
