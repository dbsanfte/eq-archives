You can solve all your problems by binding in the firepot room in TD. To get
to nexus you jusy gather shadows and go to the kelethin firepot. 5 seconds
after you zone into GF youre out of range of the guards (I think they are
only dubious anyway) and 5 mins later your at the GF spires.

Getting back is easy, gate to TD, firepot to freeport. Theres a few charts
of which firepots go where floating around. Its in the sw corner of TD,
underneath the ocean floor. I like to bind on the top of the spires so I can
get to the rest of TD as well. You take a fair bit of damage when you fall
down (100-200 pts iirc).

Enjoy the swim, Id be tempted to do it naked to save messy cr's.
