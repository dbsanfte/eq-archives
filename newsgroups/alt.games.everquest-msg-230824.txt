Since the nerf the extra AC Iksar get means more than ever and stam is
the way to go.

You realize of course if you mean to dual box that monks are no longer
able to take hits like they once did, just a heads up if you intended
the monk to tank. Of course if you have a large budget to twink (200k
or more) you could just as well go with human monk. USed to 2-box a
druid and monk combo up to 60 untill the nerf hit and and druid heals
just didnt cut it after that. Think I deleted the monk in disgust a
few weeks later...A druid SK pair would seem the best now or even a
bard pally if you want something different. Heh ahh for the good ol
days....
