Hey, I have no problem with what anybody chooses to drink or not drink
as long as they are enjoying themselves. (And not driving afterwards and
running me over.)  My only issue in all that was DT stating that
martini's were for the taste impaired. Fooboy likes his closer to the
"glass of gin" type martini, and that's fine if that's what he likes. I
just happen to like the more traditional fifties/sixties style.  Call me
old fashioned.

(No, I did NOT say that I *was* and old fashioned. That's an entirely
different drink.)

Oh, and nothing wrong with wine from a box if you like the taste and are
pretty much just looking for a buzz. I've had it and some of it's quite
alright. For dinner out on an occasion, I'll go for something pricier,
but that's just me.  Of course, given a choice, I'll often take mead
over any type of wine. Problem is we have to make our own because there
are almost no commercially made meads out there today that aren't
complete and utter ass. Might as well be coolaid with honey and
everclear in it.
