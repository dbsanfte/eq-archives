Hello,
I am wanting to know if anyone has some experience with EQ and a Linksys
wireless router BEFW11S4 working OK together?

Any thoughts about their setup if you don't mind would be helpful?

EQ and my linksys router BEFSR41 do very well together at the present but
one of the routers port had gone and we now have a laptop in the house and I
wanted to move up to the wireless......

any comments would be welcome.
regards,
Bill V.
