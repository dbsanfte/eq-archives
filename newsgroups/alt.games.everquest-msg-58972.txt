Dennis, a word of advice. Don't comment about something when it's
painfully obvious that you don't know what you're talking about. You are
basing your opinion on PvP as you've experienced it in other games - as
such, your comments are relevant. Unfortunately, you obviously haven't got
clue one how DAoC is handling it.

Hint: It's so unlike traditional PvP it's actually very fun.
