So using less CPU in background sessions is exactly the opposite of using
even less CPU in background sessions...   gotcha.

"don't render 3d" was the comment.  Not "limit framerate".  And if you don't
think there's a difference, you should be bitching about how the EQPN
developer is trying to rip people off by selling something that you already
get in the free version.  But of course we both know that your statement is
completely false.

Only useful for multiboxing...  or setting autorun and checking a website,
or setting yourself on autofollow in a raid/group and locking the screen so
your kid doesn't mess with it while you fix dinner, or, or, or...   you have
no right ever hitting alt-tab, because you obviously have no concept of
multi-tasking.  =P

What you are seeing the impact from is the added "sleep()" that lets EQ give
up cycles, not the framerate limiter (you could have really seen this in
pre-hide bazaar, where your framerate would have been below the limit
already).  Once you actually leave your character doing something, limiting
the FPS is only useful to a point, and isn't nearly as useful as limiting
the rendering to a frame a second.
