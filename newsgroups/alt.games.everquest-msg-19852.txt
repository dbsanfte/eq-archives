Geez, and here I am gloating at having 80 plat in the bank :)  What level 
is it worth getting exp rezzes at (assuming you have to pay)?

Really? I never find ANY.  Uhhh... of course I've always been too 
cowardly to go down any lower... *cough*

I like grabbing all the weapons I find, then heading back to Halas or G 
Fay and handing em out.  Every once in awhile I also slaughter bear cubs 
by the dozens and hand out newbie armor in Halas.

Eeeee those things are a pita.  The spiderlings often drop *nothing*, so 
making silk cord is a royal ... well, yeah.  PITA. :)  That combined with 
the rarity of HQ bear skins means I still haven't been able to try a 
tailored backpack - god knows what my reaction will be if I fail 
(hopefully I won't - bags seem to succeed very ofte-- no wait, I'm 
jinxing myself. Bags suck! I ALWAYS fail!  Yeah...).  Gnoll patches are 
nice though - common enough drop that I can practice tailoring by going 
in there and killing enough.  The first 4-combine is trivial now but the 
second still isn't, and I still have the third and fourth to go after 
that... btw - the Commons always seem to have tons of large/giant 
spiders.  At least in my experience.
