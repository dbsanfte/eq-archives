Well, you may be thinking that, but it's coming off as you're talking about
something that won't happen as if it already has. Yes, I know VI does not
have a stellar track record, and they have reneged on certain other quotes
(like the ones Bizbee pointed out). But I don't remember seeing people
talking about how bad horses will ruin EQ before the announcement that "yes,
we will have them after all".

This was the main point I was yelling about. But, no more yelling, I've had
my caffeine. And now I must get ready for work.
Yeah.
