I don't think it was her intent to end up with more loot for herself.   I think
Frank is right:  if you are going to single out the clerics where will it end? 

We had a guy ask for all the jewels one night for his jewelry making.  So
another guy jumped in wanting wanted all the words.  Then another person wanted
some specific drop - I think for smithing???  The group leader decided
everything would be sold.  I agreed.
(Before I got temperance I always insisted on selling the peridots as regular
loot.  Since I use them every time I play now I gladly accept the dots, (when
offered), but I never ask for them.  Now I'm going to insist they get sold with
the rest of the loot.  (How many peridots have I seen dropped?  Less than 10 in
20+ levels playing in LDON.  140 plat total.  Big woo.)) 
Everyone has to make decisions on their play style.  If I *couldn't* afford to
pay for dots I wouldn't cast those spells unless the reagent was given to me up
front.  Period the end.
