Yeah, but thats largely because Tailoring is an enforced solo
pursuit - it doesnt matter if you're tailor to a super guild, or
a lone tailor, if you do well, are fair and post to eqtraders folk
will bring you materials and you'll get to skill up.

Not everyone can muster the force required to go get uber_toy_324983
the moment they want it, and as a result while for YOU the results
from improving tailoring may not be time worthwhile, for others it
may be very very worthwhile indeed.

Not to mention the fact some folk enjoy tradeskills, and the interactions
with other players a reputation as a good, honest, high skilled tradesperson
can bring.
