The little tree there at 1500 500 where a single orc spawns is the right 
spot. I usually sit right there, that way the spawn pops and hits me and 
doesn't run away. No need to run around and kill the other spawns in the 
area, just that one orc. I camped Faelin Bloodbriar for 6 1/2 hours. I was 
dissapointed when I read Allakhazam because people said she was a pretty 
quick spawn. Apparently she wasn't for me. I wrote several poems about 
Greater Fay and orcs in the time I was sitting there..most of them were 
pretty pissed off poems too. LOL
