My cousin's wife's sister's brother-in-law has a very similar system
and had been having a very similar problem.  Recently the frequency
of the "lag spikes" has decreased dramaticly.  Can't say why it's
gotten better, too many changes, but his current config is:

All new models off
Medium Textures
No Sound
Texture Caching Off
Running via EQW under Win2k Pro
Usually has either Netscrape or his second EQ account also running

Yes, the OS is different, but the hardware is very similar (same
processor and system RAM, his Geforce Ti has 64MB DDRAM).


He <thinks> it was killing the sound that helped most, but did not

investigate thoroughly and so cannot rule out either the use of EQW
or the practice of running a second application accessing the 'net
(second EQW/EQ or Netscrape) as having somehow been the agent of
(favorable) change.  Or it could just be the luck of the Irish, who
knows?
