HEHE close but not on the mark.
A Classic Vette or Mustang or any classic will retain and increase
it's value if keeped in good shape. Consider the fact you could buy a
68 Mustang Cobra Convert back in 68 for $5000 with full options.

Technology alway decrease in value as time goes on and becomes cheaper
to buy new.
How much is that old 486DX worth. 
You can get a new PC for Less that what you paid for that 486DX if you
bought it new. My Amiga 1000 back in the day cost me $1200 now I can
get one on ebay for 100 bucks.
