I saw what well-equipped warriors were capable of before the nerf, and it
was
disgusting.

I saw what well-equipped rangers were capable of before the nerf, and it was
disgusting.

I saw what well-equipped rogues were capable of before the nerf, and it was
disgusting.

Pretty much as i figured . You bitch about monks when what you really hate
is that others have been more sucessfull then you and acquired better
equipment. It is testable and verifiable that monks where underpowered
before the nerf. I just hope that sony will realize that listening to the
likes of you is ruining them and that actual testing might be in order.
