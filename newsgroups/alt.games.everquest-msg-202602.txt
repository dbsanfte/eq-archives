Here's where I found help:

I copied the question from the forums at Sony.com

http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/042599.html

Every time I start EQ on my Win 98 comp, I get the message "Download size
exceeded for Distribution (New Textures for Main}. A list of these files has
been saved to )EQ_Missing_Files.log}"
I dont get this message on my Win XP comp, and I am wondering how to get these
missing files that EQ says Im missing but cant seem to download. 

Any suggestions or answers?

2 things with this error.
1) Put Luclin CD#1 in and run the "REPAIR" function. If that doesn't fix it,
proceed to step 2.

2) Make sure that all of EQ is installed to 1 folder. Double-click on MY
COMPUTER and select VIEW or TOOLS and then select FOLDER OPTIONS. Select the
VIEW tab. Find the HIDDEN FILES section and ensure SHOW ALL FILES is selected.
Hit APPLY and then OK. Double-click on your C: drive. Double-click on the
PROGRAM FILES folder. Double-click the folder named INSTALLSHIELD INSTALLATION
INFORMATION. Inside will be several folders and each folder has an
alphanumerical code. Find the folders that end in DEE4 and delete them. Once
deleted you should be able to install EverQuest as normal.
