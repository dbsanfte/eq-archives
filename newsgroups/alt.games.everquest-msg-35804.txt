I have to disable Norton System Doctor (something like that) before playing
EQ, or I have intermittant problems, like locking up after the character
seletion screen and having an unresponsive mouse. Half-Life used to open at
odd times also, but I just removed that.

That seemed to make things work much better for me, so I'm curious as to
what scanner you're using.
