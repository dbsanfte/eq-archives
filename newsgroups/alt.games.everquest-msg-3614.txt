Hopefully you do it with friends so you at least have somebody to chat with
while you wait. If it's a mob with a known spawn point and placeholders, if
you know the exact timing of the placeholders you may still be able to kill
some wanderers in between to pass the time.
   When we camped the riptide spear at BB docks, I think it took five or six
hours. But there was plenty of conversation, and aquagob placeholders kept
coming up out of the surf to gank, so it wasn't so bad.
  I've made four tries at camping High Shaman Phydo in SK so far. Longest was
eight hours. And no idea about where/when he or his placeholders will pop
next, so afraid to go get banged up fighting random mobs.  This one is a
*true* PITA.
