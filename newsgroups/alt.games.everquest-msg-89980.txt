Made my `newb' status overly clear I guess. Is there some reason/logic/exploit
as to why this functionality was disabled? I guess it could be used to count
the number of people on the server, but that's a really aggressive response
to a marketing problem.

I use LFG, though I count as noise to the 50+ crowd :) To an extent it's
the same problem seen from two different sides. One a group seeking new
members and the other a player seeking for groups. It would seem to be
to no ones loss to have both options open.

Although I guess the first approach favors a `surplus' situation. A group
seeking a specific character and level. Whereas the other approach allows
a character to approach a group, and is more useful when groups are rare.
