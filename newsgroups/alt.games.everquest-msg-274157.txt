It's interesting that those who find such fault with things like this are 
all but unable to enjoy anything that doesn't move them farther down the xp 
track.

There really is more to EQ than merely levelling. Criminy, in a fantasy 
adventure, do you think the characters would just run in willy nilly and 
take a stab at a dragon just to see if they could kill it? Heck no, they 
formed battle plans and contingency plans. When you go in with no plan for 
getting out, sometimes you won't get out.

There's more to the experience that running in, smacking the attack key and 
waiting for phat lewtz to drop.
