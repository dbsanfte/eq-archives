A critical point you may have missed is that very few classes are
*required* for raiding. The truly essential classes are really only
cleric, enchanter, warrior, and monk. For some raids, bards, rogues,
mages, and wizards have a critical, but very limited, role.

On any given raid, most classes are going to fall into the "are also
welcome" category.
