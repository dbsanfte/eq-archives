Update to this. Tried to help some guildies get through tonight and when
they finally got to him slow stuck. Unfortunately the enchanter missed
the multiple times I repeated how important it would be to get the mob
slowed asap with a low 60's pally as mt so slow didnt land until the
pally dropped. Unfortunately I'm finding in our case there's a reason
some ppl still aren't flagged and it's because they don't listen well. I
must have said keep a buff slot open at least 20 times in the 4 or 5
tries we made at the trial and still got elixers not taking hold
constantly. After a discussion about horse models and and targetting
with the enchanter where he logged out to turn off models, we still had
2 more failed attempts before the pally mentioned he found it hard to
target the mobs because they were inside caster's horses. The rogue must
have asked him to use F8 a dozen times as well. Sigh, frustrating
evening.

Another goodie. Started ch as soon as the pally engaged. His health
dropped faster than it took for ch to land. Asked him if he had lay
hands up, he says ya but you'd called heal so I didnt use it. Is it me
or wouldnt it make sense when you saw yourself at 5% hp and still no ch
to use it?
