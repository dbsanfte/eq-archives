Well.... having just done this fight, let me leap in with some advice.  =)

First of all Ragefire is a Kunark dragon, which means he doesn't have as
many hitpoints as a Velious dragon.  With that in mind, he's pretty easy to
take down.

For buffing, make sure to have around for dummy buffs up before you start
doing serious buffs.  For RF, dummy buffs include Reist Cold, Poison, and
Disease.  Make sure everyone has Reist Magic and Resist Fire buffs as well
as all the usual buffs.  (HP, AC, ATK, etc.)  Everyone should have as much
resist gear as possible - blue diamond bracers and the like.  If you're
standing around feared all the time, you're not much good to the raid.

Tell your casters not to bother nuking the human form of Ragefire.  He has a
lot of hitpoints but is still easy to kill.  Just let your tanks beat him
down.

When the dragon spawns, have all your melee folks back off out of range of
Ragefire's AE dispell.  Only the Main Tank should be fighting the dragon at
first, building aggro while the healers keep him alive.  Everyone else
should be well away, trying to keep their dummy buffs up as long as
possible.  When the Main Tank calls for assist, make sure all the melee's
engage at maximum melee distance - only the Main Tank should be very close
to Ragefire.

There's nothing terribly difficult about Ragefire; he's basically just Naggy
with more hitpoints.  Just keep the Main Tank alive and have the casters
nuke when he gets low on health and he'll fall easy.

If you have access to a Manaburn wizard or two, even better.  This will make
the fight very short.

A single group that consists of a tank, a cleric, and four MB wizards could
kill Ragefire easy.  When I did it, I had about six groups of folks that
were mostly at or slightly above 55, with a few 60's scattered here and
there.  Ragefire fell easy.

If your force is composed of experienced raiders who know how to wait for
assist and know how and when to heal, Ragefire is not at all difficult to
kill.  If you've participated in a couple of Vox/Naggy raids, you'll know
all you need to know about how to kill Ragefire.

Good luck!
