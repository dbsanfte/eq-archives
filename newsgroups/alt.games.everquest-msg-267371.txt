If your going to put a filter rule in for "EQ2" then you can add one for 
"EQII" as well. Don't expect other people to change the way they post just 
for the convenience of your filter rules.

It's this level of pathetic pedantics that get's peoples back up and causes 
us to think "screw you hippies" and not bother labelling at all.
