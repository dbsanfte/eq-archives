A great example of those is the class quests. I did my Mystic class quest 
tonight (again, I had also done it before on Beta1) and it was quite fun. My 
mission was to prevent the ritual raising of a dead hero who had been 
captured by some undead in Vermin's Snye. As with all class quests, it was a 
solo instance with a long lockout timer preventing me from popping in and 
popping out. I had to fight my way to the door leading into the instance, it 
was pretty buried deep in the dungeon. As I entered and walked down the 
hall, I could see pairs of blue and even skellies lying in wait on either 
side of the hall hoping I would pass by close enough to aggro both and wake 
them. After dispatching the first pair, I saw that there were two additional 
pairs of skellies to walk past. Also there was an even con roamer who 
traversed the entire hallway, thus threatening to become someone's add. As I 
moved down the hall watching for the roamer, I timed my fights to assure 
that I was always fighting only two. When I had a clear shot at the roamer I 
took him out too, but he respawned pretty quickly and I eventually learned 
to stand at a spot that his path did not get close to.  I then took out each 
successive pair of skellies until I finally made my way to the end of the 
hallway where it curved sharply to the left, revealing 3 blues all in a 
close line, and on the other side of them, the boss and the raised dead 
ritual about to get started.

One of the blues had a single down arrow. I decided to take him out first, 
but didn't think I'd need to Slow him and it would be better to land Slow on 
one of the larger mobs that would be beating on me (Shaman slow can only 
affect one target at a time). I did this and then stuck a DoT on him as well 
and tore into the down arrow blue. Meanwhile the 3rd skelly was busy 
Interrupting my casts and beating on my ass ... somehow I managed to get 
enough of them cast that my first target went down and soon after that the 
second and third. The battle got a little hairy and I was forced to blow my 
Eidolic Ward (a no cost, no time Ward with a long recast time), but in the 
end I prevailed and closed out the night with my Mystic title and spear 
reward in hand. My actual title won't be displayed until I reach 20 (I'm 
only half way through 19 now).

Yep, I definitely agree with your sentiments above and find these me vs. 
many fights to be compelling and fun, when the event is clearly tuned with 
that in mind (as all of these solo instances obviously are). I look forward 
to more of thse ...
