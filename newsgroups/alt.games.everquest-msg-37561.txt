Hehe, keep notes on the usual idiots too.
Had a level 1 guy sitting in GFay and bothering everyone and calling people
names. After 5 people got tired of him we talked in OOC about reporting him. 2
min after i get a tell from a guy with a name spelled 1 letter different from
the idiot telling me that he is a GM and is on the problem.
NOT a smart thing to do when your not even anon, so everyone can look you up,
and youre even in the zone, so report that guy for impoersonating a GM (think
thats a bannable offence, right), and the other one for general harassment.

The next day a druid with a 3rd name resembling the 2 others wanna buy some of
my Wood elf cultural armor. I do of course remember the 2 other idiots from the
day before, and refuse to sell to her. Last thing she said was that she would
just buy one from one of the others sellers.
Ahh, how i love being the only one on server making cultural wood elf armor, and
got the 2 people that are working on it on my friend list, so they can be warned
too.

Thats the stuff that make one happy you have a jerk list.
