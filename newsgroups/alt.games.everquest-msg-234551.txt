I really think its too early to call. The time to make such newsgroups
seems to be when lots of people are in the beta and think its pretty
good with lots of EQ2 posts showing up here.

Yeah, EQ2 is a totally different game from EQ. Its as though some
other company is making an MMORPG, set in a fantasy world. It could be
named "the clown's big red shoes, MMORPG" and have no references to
everquest or names, be the same game, and no one would say it was
Everquest.

For the most part I notice people using usenet less and less anyway,
unless you have some real big multi-subject more general group like
comp.sys.games.ibm.pc.roleplaying or whatever. I've seen groups go
from lots of daily posts to nearly none. Many modern younger gamers
don't use Usenet at all.
