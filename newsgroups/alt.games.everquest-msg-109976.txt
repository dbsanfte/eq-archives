I think they thought it out as far as it needed to be thought out...you can
only estimate a limited number of possible problems using special mental
powers.  Actual use of the boats was probably the only way to know how much
trouble they were really going to be.  The only thing that irked me was
making an alternate form of transportation didn't hit top priority once it
was known how unreliable they could be.  Probably something to do with
"class balancing" (read: McQuaid) and druids/wizards kept them from putting
in portals sooner.

Nevertheless, I do hope they keep them around and switch them from
transportation to entertainment vessels and go with the portals for real
transportation.

It's funny though, if you think about it. We all know how big EverQuest is
because I'm sure we've all relied on our own two feet for getting around,
and relied on the boats to get us across oceans, at one point in time.  Who
hasn't been playing on one side of the world as a relative newbie and then
decided that the other side of the world was the place to be and just
started running, to arrive at the final destination an hour and a half
later?

Newbies won't be experiencing that anymore...it's going to be all about the
portals.  I'll still do it once in awhile, for old-time's sake,
because...god I love West Karana.
