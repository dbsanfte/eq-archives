I've been away from EQ for a couple of weeks. I just connected to find that
my character has a sword through his neck.......... Is this some sort of
punishment for not playing for a while!!!!!!!!

I took a couple of screen shots just to prove to myself that I wasn't going
mad...

Anybody else experienced this sort of thing?
