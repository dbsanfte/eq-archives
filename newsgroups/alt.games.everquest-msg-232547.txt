After playing on Discord (and loving it!) I rolled up a
character on Sullon Zek the other day. Decided to go
with a Halfling Druid for a couple of reasons. One, it's
the same class/race combo as my main on another
server so I know how to play it inside out, even though
it probably sucks for PvP. Two, I figure HFL / DRU
is enough of a "kick me" sign, it should make playing
there eventful :)

My first thought of the server is that it's quieter than I
imagined. I guess I was thrown off by Discord where
the harsh perma-death rule led to a constant stream of
lowbies (I actually preferred those rules, I think). I
guess it shouldn't have surprised me much that the
population is weighted away from that end of the
spectrum.

Levelling up was no problem, with virtually the zone to
myself. Took a tip from those I did see and made myself
anon, and from my time on Discord, I bound /who to
a direction key so I can see when a PK'er was in zone.
A couple of times, a warning went up in /ooc to avoid
so and so, and being "safe" at less than level 6, I naturally
went to look... its eerie how a player going about their
normal hunting patterns can take on a different appearance
when you're the intended prey :) Saw a couple of skirmishes,
but his attempts to kill players always seemed to end with
no success. As I was sitting in the RV tunnel, I saw the eye
of Zomm (?) come floating round the corner, rooting for
potential victims like a fox in a rabbit hole. Very scary :)

Most people who would've tried to kill me moved on
when they saw my level. But there was one time where I was
battling a large wood spider for newbie armour drops... he
just stood there staring at me. I thought "what are you doing?
Waiting to KS me?" then it occured that he was probably
waiting for my health to drop to move in on me! I looted
up and ran out of there, even though I was still "safe". Later,
I cursed my paranoia, maybe he was just waiting to see if
I needed help...

maybe not :)

With a swing of the club, late last night, and after a few hours
total played, my plucky little druid dinged level 6, and I logged
out for the night. Something tells me life is about to get...
interesting ;)
