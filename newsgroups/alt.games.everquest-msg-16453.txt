Actually, you can list the most important stuff you have in the bank in one
or two of your unused command hotkey slots. At least it saves an inventory
slot (not that I would care since I play a Monk). I use this technique for
simple quests reminders and it works well as I don't have to store any
information on paper and risk losing it to the housecleaning monster ;)

On a related note, I also use a synchronized handheld (Pocket PC). It's
better than a notepad, since I can just copy paste entire chunks of text
from NGs or websites as well as zone maps, and just check it out without
leaving the game. Yeah, I know, it's too easy but I like the idea of not
killing any more trees than necessary;)

You can keep your copy of Myst:Riven, as my religion forbids me from playing
this crap.
