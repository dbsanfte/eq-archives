Two cats.  Or four.  

  We "officially" have two cats, both girls.  Skitty, who talks ALL the
time, 13, and Velly, who will pounce on ANYTHING, 6 months. 
   Then there are the 2 boy cats from next door, Blackie, the mellow,
and Whitey, the sly.  We starting letting them in when they were kittens
because they were so darned cute.  The neighbor's forbid them from
coming inside their house.  Predictably, they started spending more and
more time in our house, and soon seemed forget that they ever had
another family.  Add to the this that our neighbors are less well off
than we are, and have 5 kids.  Sometimes, they use our water or phone
because theirs gets turned off.  Getting the cats medical care is out of
the question, and the two boys had never been to the vet.  We took them
in and got them vaccinated and neutered, and pay for thier yearly shots,
plus whatever other medical needs they have (Whitey has gotten burrs in
his eye twice, cost $100 bucks a pop to get them removed.  Ouch!) 
Officially they are the next door neighbor's cat.  But in reality, they
are ours.

Annie <--- Wonders how many cats she _really_ has.
