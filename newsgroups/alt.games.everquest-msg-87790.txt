Level 40? Blink Blink. Ever try the terror hall solo at 40, the queens room?
CC goes to 45-48 easy. Orcs are green at 40 maybe.

CC is much better than Dalnir I think. While a 40 mage wont be able to
sell to the NPC merchants there you can still bank. You would need
the 'sneak' skill or be a bard/chanter to alter your faction with the merchants
to sell, you can always bank at a banker even if you are kos.
The loot is excellent in CC as well.
