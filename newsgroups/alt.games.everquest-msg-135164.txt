Druzzil ro was over 400 when I last checked. Hooray for adjustable clip
planes.
The crashing between bazaar aand SH is a worry tho, I suspect im going to
find myself under the world one of these days (like has happened twice
before in different zones). Fortunately both times so far I had soe on so I
didnt fall.
I even had to zone over to sh to sell stuff to npc vendors. It was taking
about 10-15 seconds between hitting "sell" and the sale completing.
With all these people logged on overnight, and with the large amount of data
sent in such a busy zone, I wonder if verant are starting to wish they had
implemented offline trading instead. It must be casting them a lot of
bandwidth/money.
