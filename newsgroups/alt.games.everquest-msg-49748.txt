Managing a guild is not for everyone.  It is easy enough to make a list of
things you *think* would work well, but practical application usually turns
into something else entirely.

For example, just taking your #1 rule below...  It is a good rule, and we
have the same for our guild.  However, we also let prospective new members
know that the average level of our membership in EQ is upper 40s.  How long
do you think it will be before some level 30 member of your new guild is
here complaining about your guild and the fact that all you level 50 people
don't know anything?

If you are one who is concerned about getting help with loot and xps, you
might want to try and join a guild that basically advertises that as one of
their "virtues".  On the Cazic-Thule server, we have a guild that does a
thing called the "six-pack", where they kill 6 dragons in one day.  You may
want to find something like that.

Personally, I feel a guild is better at bringing people together with more
or less the same "game playing value system", for lack of a better term.
