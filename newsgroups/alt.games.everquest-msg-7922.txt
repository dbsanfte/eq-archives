It's true that the giants do give better quests, but they are an order
of magnitude harder than, say, the dwarf ones - which are pretty
darned good anyway. Bits for the dwarf quests are dropped in Kael,
bits for the giant quests are in Temple of Veeshan...


Depends on what level you are/how good your friends/guild are, but
it's probably best to start with dwarf faction and worry about giants
later if you want to.
