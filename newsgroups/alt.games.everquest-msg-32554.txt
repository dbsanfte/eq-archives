This is the clincher for me. There are hundreds of message and discussion
forums out there and he picks Verants own, where they clearly have authority,
to flame them.
And i seriously doubt it was criticism as no doubt Verant is aware,
constructive feedback from it's customers can only help them improve the game.
It must have been along the lines of "I di3d 4nd thi5 GM would'Nt FucxInG ReZ
m3. You GUys Suxxorz. AnD h3 ch4ng3d my fuckin n4me 'wantsomedrinks'. Fuck U
Verant U fucking N4zi BasTaRds" as I can think of no less that would achieve a
banning and to post this in their own message board is monumentally stupid. You
got fucking nerfed LOL.
But maybe he was unjustly banned, so TC post your entire message here and we
will give our informed opinions.
