The first month of DAOC is free after you spend the inflated number of
dollars buying the box.  Check it out.

It would be stupid of anyone here to say you'll enjoy one game more than the
other.  I WILL say that it's my opinion that DAOC is EQ-lite.  Costs more
per month and offers a ton less content (I would say it offers damned near
NO content unless you're really really really into RvR).

I don't think graphics on DAOC is any better than SoL.

I played DAOC for over a month since release.  I just got damned tired of
trying to figure out why I should get my level 16 to level 17 when there was
zero to look forward to as a caster.  You CANNOT say that about any EQ
caster.

And the death penalty in DAOC really sucks.  Damned depressing.
