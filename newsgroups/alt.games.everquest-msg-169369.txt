Bullshit!  Perhaps lame, mindless, lazy, ignorant types believe that crap
but anyone with a brian would know if enough voices demand change then
change will come because its all those 450,000 tiny little $12.95/month
payments the stockholders so want that really hold the power to any and
every improvement in service that might come.

Well, I most likely could "enlighten myself" if I chose to read their legal
BS that attempts to slant everything in their favor and deny the consumer of
any rights, but I see no reason to waste the time chucky....  Only 2 options
are there... yes, your correct, because of the very mentality displayed
here.  How about all 450,000 or so account holders clicking the not accept
button next time?  Think that might wake someone up at SOE?  I'll bet at the
next board meeting there would be a bit of discussion given to it.  Perhaps
even a re-thinking (most likely at first a re-wording) of all that legal
"strip the customer of all their rights" crap???  Which, by the way, isn't
actually totally defendable if litigated.  Consumers do have legal rights.
They just have to know what they are and demand them is all.

So my "friend".. stuff it!
