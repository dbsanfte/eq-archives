Well, time to once again look terminally ignorant........
What movie are you all talking about? We installed the kunark version on both machines,
and have since added SoV to both. When the game kicks off I get the EULA, followed by two
black screens with logos (Sony and VI, I believe) then the static picture of Princess FV
where I log in with station name and password, then to server selection, then the static
picture of all the little inset screenshots, then the game. (This is from memory, so I
could be off a bit.) But I dont' ever recall seeing a movie of any type.
