I play mostly on the Ayonae Ro Server and was witness to some weird goings
on just the other day. I logged in and jumped on my War who was grinding xp
in the Dreadlands, when everyone was commenting on the strangest thing! No
mobs! Not a single one, anywhere near the KC zone which is normally crawling
with the little buggers! We had to pull from near the tunnel to the spire to
even find something close to a mob!

What other "oddities" has anyone else seen in EQ?
