Take a wander over to butcherblock (southe end of west wall in greater fay)
and beat up on some dwarf skeletons, giant snakes, and anything else that
cons blue (target the monster and press c). You should be able to make it
through to level 9 on thse monsters. go to www.eqatlas.com and print off a
map of butcherblocck would be a good idea.
