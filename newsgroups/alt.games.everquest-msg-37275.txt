If you mean by original poster the one that started this thread, that's me.
Re-read my original post.  No where in it did I set a price for a rez nor
did I say I was going to nor did I say I was going to advertise for
business.  What I did say was that higher-level clerics recommended I go
/role or /anon and reply to only that specify  what they're willing to
donate.  Last night, other clerics suggested I expand that to those saying
they'll donate, though not mentioning an amount.
