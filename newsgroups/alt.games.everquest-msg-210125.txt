the game's physics has a problem with the z axis . . . bolt spells used to
give double damage when the z-axis (is this the word?:) declanation is just
right, but they chagned that.......and yet, mobs can hit players from under
the world, and a mob standing up a steep slope can hit the player, but the
player can't hit the mob (like in oasis when hurt orcs run up that pillar on
the highway)

that's the issue, it's not that the game is designed to prohibit it, it's
just a side effect of an old engine

and it would be nice if it was adjusted for......higher ground is always an
advantage in warfare; firing from an elevated position is it's own tactic

but anyway, *sob* give me better dps with archery ! *sob*

i've found that this isn't the case-- double attack makes a 30/40 2hs
outperform a 30/38 bow by a longshot (ooh, so punny ~)

and not to be a complaint whore (hey, it's usenet), there's a very annoying
issue between client/server refresh rates or soemthing, because often i'll
press ranged atk to find nothing happen, then the button springs back up
very quickly (i'm not the only one, right? happens on all my chars)

so what i think is:

exactly....

and double attack =)
