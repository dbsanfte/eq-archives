Do you mean in game resolution or Windows resolution?  I play on a laptop
and a PC.  They're both at 640 480 in the game.  The PC is at
1280x(something) for windows res, and the laptop is at a fairly low res.
The laptop is the one that stays in full screen mode when in the inventory.
The PC doesn't.
