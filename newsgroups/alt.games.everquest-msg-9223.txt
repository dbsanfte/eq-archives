Actually, there's at least one critter in Velious that's very low level.

The giant guard in Kael as you first enter through EW cons WHITE to my level
1 ogre shadowknight (created for corpse recoveries).

Of course, he's got a very high magic resistance, has probably 1000+ hp and
hits like a dickens but he IS level 1. :)
