That's not a Chevy, it's a Suzuki with a Chevy nameplate pasted on it.  I 
had the Suzuki version of it, Swift GTi, 100hp from that dinky little 1.3 
liter twin cam 16 valve engine.  The car was an absolute blast to drive, 
great gas mileage, even with me driving it full out 90% of the time.  The 
one issue with it was that when I did need to take it into the shop for 
work, it was usually in the shop waiting for them to get parts from 
Japan.  Twice, they ended up cannibalizing a new car for parts as it had 
already been 3 to 4 weeks.

I'd be hard pressed to buy something other than another Mazda at this 
point, I drive a Miata, have for 10 years now, the car has been rock 
solid, is a dream to drive, gets 30mpg with me driving it.  It's had the 
brakes done once, still on the original clutch, at 126000 miles and going 
strong still.
