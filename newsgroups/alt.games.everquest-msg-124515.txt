Oh, it's a big chunk of cash for my guild too.  We're far from uber.
But like I said, we haven't even been able to sell those 3 BP's at 3K
each yet.

As for Yeldema and the weaker WW dragons, go on, have some fun :-)
Plenty of them can be done by one or two 55+ groups, and the faction
hits from killing 4 or 5 of them can be made back in a night's Kael
Arena fighting.  You get some nice necklaces & the chance at 55/60
spells and dragonhorn armour.  Plus, like I said, it's fun :)
