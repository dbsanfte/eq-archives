Damage bonus.  In the main hand, there is a level-dependent damage bonus 
that is added with every hit.  So faster hitting means the damage bonus 
gets applied more often. 

Mainhand weapond should be compared not with dmg1/dly1 vs. dmg2/dly2 but 
with (2*dmg1+bonus)/dly1 vs (2*dmg2+bonus)/dly2.  Further experimentation 
shows that the '2' varies as your ATK becomes obscene, but this provides a 
much better first approximation.
