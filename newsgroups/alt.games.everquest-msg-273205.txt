Has anyone ever been able to do this. All i get is not online, which is
strange since i'll logged into eq2 and eq1.

according to the FAG it's eq.<server name>.<pc name> if you want to chat to
someone in eq1, for eq2 it's the same format but the prefix is eq2.

If you've had this working, let me know.

Thanks.
A
