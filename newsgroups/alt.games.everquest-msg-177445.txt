Yes. Provided you have installed and registered The Planes of Power, the
podium books will take you directly to the Plane of Knowledge. From there
you can get to other zones, such as Rivervale, Queynos, Oggok, or Luclin
(places such as Shar Vahl, or the Nexus--Requires The Shadows of Luclin).
Makes traveling around a lot faster and usually a lot safer since the books
are located just outside of the actual locations, except for the Nexus.

Clicking on the books without The Planes of Power ports you to the safe
place in the same zone.

On occasion, someone zones using the books and is immediately aggroed. This
occurs because someone trains to the book and zones, just as the unlucky
soul comes through. Rough.
