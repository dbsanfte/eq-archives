Well, they should give you a credit for unscheduled outages.  My cable
company, phone company, and ISP all do, why should Sony/Verant be any
different?

Who cares that it would be a few cents, the point would be made (and at
43 cents refunded to 450K subscribers it works out to almost 200Gs out
of Verants pocket) to Sony/Verant and you can damn sure bet that
unscheduled outages would happen less frequently.
