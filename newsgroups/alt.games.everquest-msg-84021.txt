--Ask anyone of the poor clerics who spent 70+ hours camping that
fucker in SolB how they would feel, knowing it was broken.
--Ask anyone who's completed most of an annoying 30+ hour quest, only
to discover the end MoB doesn't exist
--Ask the poor shaman whos spells don't ever drop anywhere, and are
giving away NToV loot just to get one.
--Ask anyone who has max Ally Whisperling Faction, only to discover
that it does them no good because the parts to the key haven't been
put in the game yet, or the quest itself is broken.

This was more or less a query to see if anyone has seen any of this in
the game, not the bitchfest you assumed it was.

But since you brought it up...would you keep your programming job if
you released a product that was missing some of its code?

Also:  I highly dobut it's only these four items.  These are just four
items that this one person knows about.  What else is there?
