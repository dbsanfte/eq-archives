I hate you. Where did you get the legs from? I can't get this friggin Zorash (censored)

They kind of are. We Iksar aren't the STR/STA boasting Ogres that most people
go for. Dunno why they all go for this. If I made a warrior I'd go Ogre, 
as warriors (like clerics) have a definite role in the late game. But it
doesn't really have much impact on SK's. I still hit quite hard as Iksar :)

I know that. You have to educate people somtimes. I recently have seen a
group where an SK applied and the leader *insisted* on a warrior. The SK was
a full total twink with uber armour and weapons, they still would not take him.
Some people are clueless.

More or less the same for me. Most notice I hit for 115 and have a 140 DD proc.
That normally makes them forget any strange ideas about SK's, especially after
I just lightningfast taunted a mob off a caster as well :)

I am and I'm going to take him up to 60. I also have fun with him (and I think the
changes to our looks are great. Dreadscale looks like we're some space marine
corps now .. I love it :) ).

Plane raids are fun as well ... I look forward to some Fear raind where I'll
be most predictably the only Iksar SK ... looting the Iksar SK only greenmist
stuff :-)
