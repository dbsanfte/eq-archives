Oh, I agree. What snippets I've heard it sounds like the code has
become a spaghettified nightmare. Having done maintenance coding for
such works in the past, I can appreciate the daunting task this can
impose. Change a menu item here, but oh look! Some hotshot know-it-all
coder put some piece of streamlined assembly over there for some
completely unrelated feature and now that the specifically referenced
offset is different, accessing that menu now causes a crash! Or data
corruption!

At the same time, it also tells of poor coding and documentation
practices in the past. Possibly continuing to this day. If they're even
remotely like EA, they probably do a bare minimum of testing to meet
some pretty unrealistic goals. This always leads to poor documentation
and sloppy coding. If they've been doing the cost-cutting measures so
many software companies have done, they lost their best and brightest
able to keep up with these sorts of things and kept the mediocre
programmers who can make things work - sort of - but may not
neccessarily fully comprehend certain subtleties of coding. [As an
aside, I would fall into the lower ranks of mediocre programmer side
myself]

Not saying Sony is any better or worse than other software giants out
there right now, but at the same time that's nothing to be proud of
either. Given the development life of EQ, it's mediocre quality
software, and that really says something about the state of software
today.

I recently started playing "We <3 Katamari", been revisiting "Metroid
Prime" in preperation to start "Metroid Prime 2", and been looking over
some of my older code in hopes of actually possibly perhaps some day
finishing one of my numerous projects :)
I think I wore myself out with Civ, Civ2, Civ:CTP, CTP2, and Alpha
Centauri. I'll ocasionally look at FreeCiv.

Been playing for about two years. Wife's been playing for almost six.
I'm still pretty into it, despite what they've been doing to it to make
it "better." Wife's pretty burned out now, though. We're looking at
maybe trying EQ2 and WoW this upcoming year.

Me and my stupid lizardman requirement...

Xiphos - Also, it's always fun to occasionally get back to basics with
the Wizardry series :) 1 and 6 through 8 are my favorites.
