That's why I like this group so much :)  At it's core it's a group of 
people with an excellent knowledge of the game who are willing to 
explain the how, where, and whys of EQ.

I do my best to help out the true newbies of EQ, the very few I see 
these days.  Most recently I pulled some cats off a poor struggling 
pally (oops, sorry, paladin ;)) in EC and bandaged her up, noticing she 
seemed awfully bare.  I inspected her (newbies aren't old enough to be 
offended at my not asking ;)) and saw that she was still fighting in her 
guild robe with her guild weapon.  I gave her my centi ss.  It was all I 
had on me decent for a paladin, but I'm guessing that at her level, it 
probably gave her a great edge and made what I humbly consider the worst 
stage of the game (EC levels suck :p) a bit easier to get through.

I'm also happy when I find someone who has never travelled far beyond 
their own home.  I pick them up and we go for a nice tour - I usually 
take them to the moon, as it's just fun to say "oh yeah, travelling off-
world now." ;)  I can hardly wait until my necro gets to higher levels.  
My very first experience with a tour of Norrath was with a Necro, and 
DMF + spires = headrush *g*

Ryou (of course, when they're 7 levels older in Oasis, I'll be ambling 
through with a spec pet just to hear the screams ;))
