No GM in thier right mind is going to *warn* or *chastize*(OMG I PLAY EQ AND
MOM'S HERE...SHIT!) someone who is twinking or powerlevelling when they have
other dipshits to deal with in the game that are far more of a problem then
twinkers or powerlevellers.

Think about it friend...Let's pretend for a moment that you are a GM
Brandon.
You get 3 petitions and you're only allowed to deal with the 2 most
important ones...which of these is more important here?

1) Ishva hasn't spawned in PAW for 3 days...
2) A 50th lvl mage is being a total dink and cursing in /ooc and /shouts and
ksing all the newbies in black burrow...
3) A 52nd lvl druid is powerlevelling a barbarian warrior at icy orcs..

Just use your head here...there are better things to do then to bitch about
what you're jealous about Brandon...get over it and move on or find a new
game.

Plain and simple...it sounds to me like jealousy at it's best. OOOOO the
little green monster known as Brandon.
He's a loser therefore he cannot make  friends on EQ to powerlevel him.
Since he can't find friends on EQ to powerlevel him, I'd have to assume he
can't find a friend to transfer items for him to lower level characters so
he CAN twink them.

Nuff said....
There's nothing sexier then a 1st lvl barb shm in full totemic ..... =)
