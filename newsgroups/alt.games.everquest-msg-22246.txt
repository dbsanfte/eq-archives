I recommend +2 full plate, a +3 or greater large shield (which basically
makes you INVULNERABLE to missile weapons), and the Sword of Roses.  I
have my rep at 20 and this is pretty much my gear, so you can see that
it works well for justice.  Of course, you could use this gear if you
were evil, too, but you do mention wanting justice, so I am assuming
you're talking about a good character.

I haven't even run across a gun in BG1 or 2, but it would be useless,
anyway. Everyone is immune to normal weapons, and where are you going to
find +3 .45 rounds for anything approaching a sane price, anyway?
