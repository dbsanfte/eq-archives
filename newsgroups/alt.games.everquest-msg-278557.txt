WoW seemed to have a pretty good balance of this with instances. Most of the 
"good" items do require groups. I play WoW and usually group for quests etc. 
it is just more fun, the fact that I CAN solo if I am on for 1 hour that is 
nice.
If WoW had the LFG features that EQ1 had then it would greatly increase the 
number of groups I would get. It is hard to travel around looking if there 
are people looking for a group for instance1 when I am on a character too 
high for that in another city all together.

The LFG window in EQ1 is probably the thing I miss the most. It is simple to 
look and suggest an alt to someone looking for people.
