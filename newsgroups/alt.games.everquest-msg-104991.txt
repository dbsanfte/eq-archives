    Our rogues are pretty good about controlling aggro, and we need the
extra damage output when only 25 people decide to show up. Again, if you get
add aggro, die in place. Oddly enough, the guild seems to have the most
problems doing pulls to the room with the trap in it before the Itraer
room - almost always one wipe or near-wipe, no matter how many people come.
And they aren't even pushing mobs into the trap anymore.

    Learn what her weapon drops look like when she holds them, and scout her
beforehand. Her non-weapon items (mask, neckpiece, ranged slot item) are her
best drops, so if she isn't dual wielding she's worth bagging in our
experiences.

    I was surprised we got a clean pull. The puller had to train a whole
buch of rockguards around for a little bit before we got him solo. And yes,
the race to debuff (including Cripple) is fun.

    On our first visit since I asked the guild to add him to the target
list, we got BP, cloak, and one of the junk items. Seeing the stats on BP
and cloak convinced a lot of people that he's worth doing, especially
considering how fast he dies after everyone gets to Umbral. The random plate
drops are good rewards for our recruits, too.
