My point on intellect could use a bit of rephrasing, perhaps.

It does not really take much to post flames. Why else do you think there are
so many scathing racist flames? Flames are obviously meant to enrage the
person it is directed towards. Your flame, however, has not appeared to
enrage anyone.

You've been on this board longer than I have, so I'm certain you know that
Bizbee and Dark Tyger have this sort of 'natural' scorn in their writing.
The responses you see in your thread are normal for them.

I've learned in life that you can't really change people, as most have no
interest in changing. Arguing with logic, reason, and sometimes even threats
does little more than annoy your adversary. It is the equivalent of talking
to a wall.

In retrospect, I don't think I've -ever- changed anyone's opinion on
anything terribly important. No matter how many good points I made, or no
matter how many times I've brought up something they couldn't answer to,
they always kept the same state of mind - there was just no desire for them
to change. Your situation is the same.

Heh, if they were not around, other people that share similar qualities
would be in place. I wonder if that is that your purpose?

Reading your posts, I'm inclined to believe that you have a bit of the
'Walter Mitty' syndrome, as well. Admittedly, this is the first thread I've
read from you, but that's simply how first impressions go.
