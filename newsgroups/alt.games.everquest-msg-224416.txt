Just had a look at EqCaster and it seems to depend on the spell in
question, the 'pure' cures work this way but the newer hybrid ones
don't.

Disinfecting Aura does the following if I'm reading the benefits
correctly:

1: Removes 10 Poison Counters
2: Removes 10 Poison Counters
3: Removes 10 Disease Counters
4: Removes 10 Disease Counters

Abolish Disease on the other hand does:

1: Removes 36 Disease Counters

So... Disinfecting Aura would cure a moderate Poison DoT and a
moderate Diease DoT but not a severe DoT of either type while Abolish
Disease would remove almost any diease based DoT in one cast.
