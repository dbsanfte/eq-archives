Of course you'd make SK/Pal less desired for exp groups, that
would be the point.

SK/Pal/Warriors constitute the "tank" trio of the game.  Most
groups want one of the above.  For a long time, most groups went
with a warrior whenever possible, SK/Pal were definately a
distant second choice for the job.

These days, the shoe is on the other foot, most groups want a
knight, and will take a warrior only once they've exhausted all
the other choices.

A "balance" fix would put warriors up where SK and paladins are
now, in rough parity.  Currently you rarely see someone saying
"darn, no shadowknights, lets give up and take the paladin" or
vice versa; for their job the two are relatively interchangable;
they get aggro quickly, hold onto it very well, and sponge up
damage with the best of them in most circumstances.  Yes,
paladins and SK come with different skill sets, so depending on
what your group lacks one or the other might be preferred, but in
the end this averages out.

I'd want to see warrior differentiated from the two knight
classes, so simply increasing their aggro abilities might not be
the answer, thats a potential trade off you make in picking
them.  But in final analysis, its a very important one; if
everyone in the group is forced to play more gently in order to
allow the warrior extra time to get aggro and to be more careful
not to steal it from him, then he's essentially holding back the
whole group; wait an extra 10 seconds to slow and you waste a
bunch of healer mana, nuke less often and your casters are doing
less damage per second, use less effective weapons and your DPS
guys in the  back are also less DPS than they could be.

Whatever the solution, though, the answer to your dilemna lies in
the words "too much".  If warriors are boosted too much, we're
back to warriors first, SK/Pally only if no warriors to be
found.  If warriors are boosted too little, the current situation
prevails.  But if they are boosted just right, then the holy
grail, "balance" is found.

For what its worth, here's my solution: boost their aggro some,
perhaps by fixing Taunt so it works more than 1/3rd the time
(this is the sort of fix that made Pacify usable, the spell
didn't change at all, but instead of only working 1/4th the time
it now works 9ths the time) and give them better damage when
tanking; probably by dramatically increasing their riposte
frequency.  How can you do this when other classes also get
riposte?  Well, how come ranger track is sortable?  How come
Rogue hide and sneak lets them move invisibly?  After all, others
have the same abilities... on paper.

What they shouldn't do is add some new discipline or AA ability
or in any other way address the problem in a way that only
affects high level warriors; the class needs a boost from level 9
up.  They "fixed" the cleric solo problem and relatively low
stackability problem in a way that really only helped from level
56 up, and the "up" was level 60, then they added more levels to
the game so their big fix now applies only to 56-60.  (I'm
talking about cheaper UHOF plus summoned hammer (56 spell) plus
Yaulp V/VI)  Clumsy and didn't help the 1 to 55 people much at
all!  Later they added desirable camps with very high DPS, which
has made the cleric desirable again for a while at all levels
where he's a better healer, but eventually mudflation will kill
that fix, leaving the cleric third class healer again since no
real fix has been put in place... and changing the group exp
bonus has meant that inability to solo well means less than it
once did; that fix is more permanent.
