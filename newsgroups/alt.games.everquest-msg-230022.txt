    The list of recipes is long enough that I don't see people finding stuff
that way, at least not for old quests. And given how vague or misleading
some of those clues were, good riddance to the old quests. For new quests,
either make the required tradeskill item a post-250 trivial (and thus
unlisted), or do what the Grand Oracle quest did and have the quest giver
hand our crucial components as you progress with the quest. So you can try
and pre-gather stuff, but you can't do the combine until you reach the
correct step (by which point you should know the recipe anyways).

    I'm looking forward to it, although I can see the problems now. One,
skill-mod items. I have a smithing skill of 220, but I'm wearing +15% gloves
for an effective smithing of 253. Do I see the same recipes as someone with
220 skill, 250 skill unmodified, or do I see more than a 250 unmodified
would see? Two, searchability. If all we get is an alphabetical listing by
primary product, it's going to be cumbersome to use. But it still sounds
like an improvement over the current system, and I have to admit I'm looking
forward to finally finding out what the scaler is used for!
