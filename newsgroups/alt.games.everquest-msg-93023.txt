I shouldn't be replying since I have no experience with the
VR features of EQ, but...

If don't suffer from any disability that prevents you from
typing (meaning you just have never gotten around to
learning to type well), taking up EQ might drive you to it.

I know at least a couple players who have learned to type
just because of EQ's communication demands.

If you are prevented from typing at all, I recommend trying
out any VR you pick up in a lightly trafficked IRC chat room
first. This is a good analogy to communication demands of
EQ.
