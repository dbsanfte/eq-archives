So, in that case people who refuse to fight (on morals) when called up to
war are wrong?

People who eat pork are wrong?

People who eat beef are wrong?

Why can't religious people just accept that that their religion is their
<own> choice, you can't force your religous morals and beliefs on others?
Any person with even a passing knowledge in history (and present day
politics) will know the worst atrocities of man occur directly as a result
of religious tension and that theocratic societies have been amongst the
most repressive on earth.

I think if you wanted to tackle the horrid task of trying to determine what
is "universally objectionable", then the first concerns you would have to
throw out the window is religous ones, then the second thing would be <all>
your own convictions. You would have to approach the task from a completely
clean slate, which I think is beyond the ability of humans anyway...  : /
