I have a level 11 (almost 12) wood elf druid.  I spend plenty of time
soloing because sometimes I just want to play by myself.  The problem I
am having is with my tactics.

Right now when I solo, I mostly go after things like orc centurions and
giant spiders in West Commons.  They generally con blue to me.  However,
fighting just one orc centurion or one giant spider generally leaves me
almost drained of mana and sometimes low on health.  Fighting even a
single orc legionaire, even if he cons blue to me, forget it.  I'd be
dead meat.

I must be using incorrect tactics.  So I'm here to ask for advice on how
to solo better.  What spells to have memorized.  Etc.  Also any advice
on how to minimize "down time" would be appreciated.  When soloing, the
game is just too boring, because I spend all my time meditating for
mana.

Thanks for any advice.  :)

-Ed
