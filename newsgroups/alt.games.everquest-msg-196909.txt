I'm assuming you have all the research spells up to your level (I 
hope, haven't check the lower level ones), but I know all but 
Tepid Deeds (24), Feedback (29), and Allure, Paralyzing Earth 
(49) are available in the PoK Libarary. Check around a little 
gnome illustionist, they're on various vendors around her.

I may not be 100% accurate but I know these spells sell real well 
when I make em and put em on my mule in the bazaar (100p ea). 
Others I had to sell for 15p to undercut the vendors in PoK.

Also, you really want to get your research up. 1) to avoid greedy 
enchanters such as myself. 2) Some of the high end Drop only 
spells are now researchable, but only with a high research skill 
(and the components are more pricy then lower level research 
spells, due to higher level of mobs dropping em). 3) With LoY, 
ONLY Int casters can make the special spells for other spell 
casting classes. Not sure on that trivia but I was 200 when I did 
it and still failed on someone elses combine (thank goodness for 
understanding good sports). He WAS going to pay me 50 plat for 
the combine (I didn't take it, I'm greedy but fair).

Not all of the spells are available in PoK, you still have to 
hunt around for some. For a darn good list of where and who, 
check out EQ.Crgaming.com and for research lists and combines 
check out that site and www.eqtraders.com.

Hope this helped.

If not, Feedback, Allure and Paralyzing Earth are only a mere 
100p each, check me out in the bazaar.  ; )
