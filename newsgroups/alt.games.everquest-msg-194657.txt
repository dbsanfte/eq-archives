Well, died, but got this part of the quest done.  I decided what the
heck, I'll try to slow her, pull around the boat, sick pet, and camp.
Unfortunately when I slowed her, it aggroed all 4 of her even though
they were nowhere near each other.  Ooglyn, Ooglyn, Ooglyn, and Ooglyn
proceeded to tear myself 52 and my 49 pet apart.  Couldn't keep em all
rooted long enough to gate. =(  Was bound in POK, rand back, lucked
out on the boat and was back within 15 minutes, looted my corpse,
buffed and swam to spawn point underwater where fortunately, I caught
the NPC's to finish this part of the quest.  As a matter of fact,
surprise, surprise, there were 4 of each of the NPC's including the
final Greater Spirit.  Made for some interesting screen shots.  Funny
because every time I said my lines, all 4 answered and tried to give
me the same item.  What a screwed up quest.  Ah well, short of losing
a bit of exp, I'm on to the next.  Already have the items for the
shield, so I'll get that turned in and on to trying to find someone to
help me with the Black Dire.

Thanks for your suggestions =)

PS  Kept my invis to animals up the whole time and none of the sharks
aggroed, even the dark blue Killer Sharks.
