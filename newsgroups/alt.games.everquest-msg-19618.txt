I think you missed his point.  The law in California is written so that you
can't argue your way around the law.  If they specfically said an open container
of alcohol, that would not cover an open container of siad with alcohol in it.
Hence, most states use open container laws.  And yes some states have been known
to use it in other cases, exampe CT, Open container of hot coffee spilled onto
the drivers lap, hits 2 parked card and telephone pole.  Please down to open
container, instead of wreckless driving (or something like that).
