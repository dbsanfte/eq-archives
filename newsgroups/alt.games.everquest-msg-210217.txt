Warrior's role is to absorb and mitigate damage, which they are the 
undisputed kings of.  They make the most efficient use of the clerics' 
mana.  Imagine an SK with 5khp needing to get healed every 3500-4k points 
of damage taken, vs. a warrior with 6500hp needing to get healed every 5k 
points of damage.  25% better use of cleric mana.

My numbers here are based on a 65 dark elf SK with decent gear and 150ish 
AA and a 60 ogre warrior in just about equal gear and no AA, but I think 
you see my point.  I also group with a 65 dwarf warrior that's approaching 
7500hp mark.  In an XP group situation a properly geared warrior performs 
just about as well as a knight in terms of mana required to keep everybody 
in the group alive, especially if the puller can get the warrior some good 
aggro.  Key phrase in there being "properly geared."  In a raid situation 
where the mobs hit hard and fast there's absolutely no question you want a 
big beefy warrior in there with defensive discipline up taking the hits.

The downside being that of the 3 tankly classes, warriors are worst at 
reliably generating aggro so are very very gear dependent.  You are right 
in that SKs (and Paladins) are much better at keeping aggro.
