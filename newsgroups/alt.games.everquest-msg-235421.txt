I know I have to upgrade my computer and I'm in the process of doing so.
Already bought a new 128Mb GeForce FX 5800 graphics card, but its agp and my
old motherboard had no agp slots. So I also got a new motherboard. Problem
is my computer, which was state of the art when I bought it, has no parts
except the hard drive which are compatible with the new computer parts and
its taken me 2 months to save up and buy the 2 parts I did get. At this rate
it will take me another 3 months before I get the DDR ram, CPU, case and
fans in order to have a new working computer. I was hoping someone else had
had this problem and knew how to solve it so I don't have to wait 3 months
to play. I've already downloaded the new drivers for the graphics card and
installed them, but didn't help.

Looks like I'll just have to wait until I get the new computer. Thanx for
trying to help, it was appreciated.
