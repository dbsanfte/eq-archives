Topposting is not common practice.

Another Arch Convoker here (if you don't believe me, ask any lowland elite
member) and I must agree with Mairelon. Concussion and built-in aggro
reduction is key for wizards (that's why those pop pants are so extremely
good for wizards; 1 sec clicky concussion). You won't survive a summon on
any decent mob, rune or no rune. Mages and druid simply can't nuke as much
as wizards because of the huge aggro we get.

Quadkiting is a totally different subject and pretty much useless when you
get lvl 65 and your decent nukes. Plus grouping is way more efficient for
exp these days anyway (you would know if you bothered to read patch
messages).

Considering you are talking about quadkiting as your normal exp and "bigger
mob" I take it are about lvl 50 or so and in a guild just barely taking down
Kunark Dragons?
If not, you probably are responsible for half the wipes of your raid, if not
all, because of your lack of knowledge of the game.
