Ok, didn't intend to turn this into a legal debate and or flame war...

just thought it would be 'of interest'.

Let me see, where to start. First of all, I don't condone breaking the law,
and despite the  non binding property value here, I think he most likely
would be found to have broken some law here. This was sent just before I
left work and hastily typed.  (I don't bother with newsgroups from home...
my connection is too slow... I mainly post during lunch break (like now) but
I felt like popping that in when someone sent it to me in mail.)

On the other hand I have little pity for the plat sellers, because some of
them (at least) are the lowest forms of life on the planet. I know one of
them (Used to work with this woman. Got her fired, and she deserved it, and
not for what I'm about to describe here. The day after she was escorted out
I got delivered a sexual harassment suit by her lawyer.) She always tried to
get me to sell her Tyas... Tyas would be a gold mine, she can get premium
dollars for characters with early 'born' dates and long playing times. Give
her a week to PL him to 65 and drop some AA's on him and away he'd go.

She constantly regaled me with tales of her exploits... literally. She scams
plat. She scams gear. She runs casinos and drops carrier when she gets a big
mark. If there's a dupe she gets a new account, does the dupe like crazy,
the washes the plat through 2 or more new accounts on the way to be hidden
away on inactive accounts that she will pay to reactivate when she needs it
to fill an order.
She macros, she ninja loots. She even claims to have stripped trusting
people in her guild blind when they gave their password out in guildchat or
on guild message boards, and then helped them with some (lesser value) gear
to help them out when they found the damage. (the compassionate one...)
She'd time the strip when someone else was leaving the guild in a huff.

I know all of these people are not like this, but quite frankly I don't want
to associate with either of these types. I'm not throwing parties for the
scammer. I'm not throwing a wake for GOM either. I will admit the remark
about Yantis being in somewhat poor taste.

As far as the legal situation, I am not a lawyer, but I think this guy will
take some form of punishment for doing what he did, assuming a prosecutor
wants to mess with a $3000 case involving virtual property. I know of an
analogous situation one of my neighbors went through, but it's not exact and
in legal terms analogies can break real fast.

Short short version was he rented a room in his apartment out in college,
guy skipped out on the rent, small claims court judge refused to render
judgment in his favor because he didn't have the right to rent the room our
in the first place, it was specifically denied that he can rent the rooms
out in his contract. He was able to pursue legal action on the bad rent
check he got from the guy though... it doesn't exactly make sense to me, not
being a legal type, but that's how it drew out. I understand the other guy
spent a weekend in the county jail and had to pick up trash for a week, but
my neighbor never got his money.
