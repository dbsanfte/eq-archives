I'm all for challenging authority when the authority is wrong, or is
trampling on my rights. I don't see that applying in this case though.

The venue (a single online game) is extremely narrow. The game world
is the property of a private entity, not a government. The rules of
the game are simple and clear, and following them is not a burden. The
rules are designed to maximize the enjoyment of the majority of the
game population. 

The OP deliberately attempted to circumvent the rules. He was caught,
and received a 72 hour time-out. Given the full situation, appeals to
the time-honored concept of challenging authority fall completely
flat.
