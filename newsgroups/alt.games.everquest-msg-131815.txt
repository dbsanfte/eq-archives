Aye, that's where the faction work comes in.  If you do the 'can I help 
with the dishes?' quest, and slaughter the weeds in the garden, eventually 
you can get to where you're still only indifferent if the illusion drops 
anyway.  Heck, I came within aggro range of my ex mom in law a while back, 
and she didn't attack even though we've been divorced for two years...
