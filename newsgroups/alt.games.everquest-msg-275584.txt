I might have been unclear, but I was just commenting on other posts and on
the fact that they seemed to me rather unilateral. Personally, in this case
I didn't challenge anything, and wouldn't have had any reason to do so,
since I do not play online, and I do not insult people - there might be
exceptions, but they are really extremely rare.

What I find quite striking, in fact, is that the discussion has (almost)
completely ignored themes like "the wisdom of their rules", for instance; or
questions like "Should the money a person pays to play buy also the right to
have a say in the definition of the rules and/or of the procedures to
implement them? and, how far, exactly?" Or: "are there customer's rights, in
this business model? can they be defined? is there something that needs a
redefinition, some improving, some discussion at least?"

Even if the way the OP presented the matter wasn't directly conductive to
this - in fact, it was possibly an hindrance (and even if he didn't
personally come out as a very likeable character,so to speak), IMHO these
(and several others, of course) might still have been interesting directions
for the discussion to take; and I dare say that not so many years ago
(here's where my age come into play) several people would have proposed a
lot of sub-threads of this kind.

It didn't happen, and almost everybody seem to think that the matter is
obvious and uncontroversial. I have learned it with some surprise, accept it
as a piece of reality, and will still beg to differ. And cannot help finding
it all somewhat indicative of the present social climate (for the very
little it may be worth, of course!)

This, BTW, is just to make my position clear. I do not expect that many
people find it interesting nor propose to open a discussion on this. And
still respect those who disagree with me.
