It wasn't supposed to be a very productive weekend. I was supposed to spend
Saturday
running around town, getting new anime and a few snacks, then catch the new
Harry
Potter film. Maybe around 7pm get a little shard farming done before a guild
raid.

  Instead I got a Halls of Honor kite group early, around 10am, and ground
away at
Ada's AAs all day. Took catnaps during med breaks and long battles. Relied a
lot on
Flaming Sword of Xuzl; in long battles, it's worth as much as an extra
Sunstrike. Ada
managed to grind out 5 AA points before I did log to get DVD's and snacks.
  When I got back, I dutifully checked around to see if there were anything
useful I
could do. It was now around 10pm; the guild isn't big enough to raid these
days, so I
was free to go join someone else's. Whaddaya know, there is a guild farming
BoT
key pieces in Storms...and they don't mind helping Ada get here Storm Taarid
Bone!
  (Cue stupid joke about how "Adastraea Gets Boned".)
After the raid breaks up, I gather all of Ada's quest pieces from the bank
and do the quest,
finishing with a report to the dwarf in PoK. Ding! 6 AA for the day.

  Sunday after church I'm free to grind again. I get a promising BoT group
and most of
another AA when the entire group decides to pick up and join an open Terris
Thule
raid that has achieved critical mass - 48 people. Since this will be good
for another raid
AA, I'm all for it. Off to the Plane of Nighmares...
  As we meet at the zone in to PoNb, we have 60 people in the raid. But a
signifigant
number have not completed the hedge event; and some who have, seems to have
their
flags screwed up. Quite a few have to drop out for being unable to zone in
to PoNb.
They are good-natured about it, too; no one makes a nuisance of themselves
in the raid
channel trying to get us to wait for them to fix their flags or finish an
impromptu hedge
event, which they just called...no, everyone wishes us well and hopes to get
in on the next
raid. Man, where did these nice people come from?
  Many thanks to the guy who posted the Tales of Loral for giving me a
heads-up on the
battle. Our field commander, Tenchi, also explained it to us, maintained
discipline effectively ("IF YOU HAIL THE PP EARLY, YOU HAD BETTER HAVE AN
UNKNOWN ALT TO PLAY!!") and led us up the valley through all sorts of lame
Protectors of Terris. Along
the way someone linked a warrior-only breastplate with jaw-dropping stats -
over 300 HP
and such. I'm not sure if it dropped from one of the Protectors or was
someone linking
what they got from the Plane of Time version of TT; I didn't see a message
saying it was looted, but was probably too far away.
  And then...Annah appears.
  Annah was the person - a guy, and I think a male toon - who "organized",
if you could
call it that, last week's screwed up Xanamech and Behemoth raids. Since
then, he's been
regarded as bad luck. Tenchi and friends gave him a lot of abuse, fearful
that his mere
being in zone might give us bad luck and cause us to wipe. He explained
"this isn't the real Annah, I'm his grilfriend...only he didn't tell me how
rude people were". The raid chose
to regard this as a feeble ploy to get us to tone down the rippage, and
ignored it. Personally
I would have given him/her the benefit of the doubt; I didn't say anything.
Bad luck can happen to anyone, but Annah's incompetent management was what
screwed me out of
a PoI factory key. But I won't abuse him over that; I just hope he learned
something out it.
  Annah eventually logs. We are ready at the dome. We go in and engage.
Tenchi's scouting
of the event indicated butterflies would pop when TT was down to 80%, and
again at 75%.
It was more like 70% and 65%, but we handled them. I  was slow getting out
when she hit 50%, and got debuffed; but someone MGB'ed C5 right after, so I
was good to go. I soon
ran out of mana and had to med. The gargoyles came to life; our designated
kiters had
some work to get and keep aggro on them, they kept coming back to the
raidforce near
their mistress. I managed to scrape together enough mana for a final nuke;
then she was dead,
and we went to work on the gargoyles. They proved manageable, and the
celebrations
began.
  Adas got another Ethereal Parchment off of TT; the gear she dropped went
to luckier
rollers. She hailed the PP, got her flag, and went back to PoK for her AA.
Her first Goddess
kill! The Queen of Nightmares, dead to the power of Love! Her dreams will be
beautiful from now on...
  More grindage got close to another AA that day. A few more, and she will
have her
coveted Mistress title and some crit power. After that...more than likely,
work on Rabotev,
who has many vital AA's to earn. Though I expect grinding to 59 and selling
Protection
of the Cabbage in PoK during those off hours when no one is selling C3 will
be some
sort of income...
