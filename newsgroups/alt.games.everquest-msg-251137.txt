For socializing, yes.  For a varied and challenging combat, no.

My Paladin can stand in Darkness Falls and farm seals at a pretty decent 
clip, while taking part in conversations on broadcast and alliance chat.  
There is no way my Tanker in CoH can do much else while fighting, less of 
all follow an extended conversation.  And other archetypes are even worse 
off.  Think of single-pull as a kind of crafting ... farming, basically. 
CoH has NO form of crafting, so you socialize at a heavy cost.  Good or 
bad?  Depends on the type of player.
