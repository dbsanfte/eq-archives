Armor part was in one of the more recent patch messages.

The DEX helps the weapons process.  The main reason I want the extra
HPs on the pet is for solo.  The 60+ pets enrage for 10 seconds when
their HPs get below 10%.  Don't want the pet to go from 11% health to
none on one hit. I have seen my pet go from 10% to a sliver of health
then hang on for 10 seconds more because they enraged.  That's lots of
time to heal, start summoning another, or get out of Dodge.

The Amulet is Royal Amulet of Takish-Hiz MAGIC ITEM Weight: 0.7 Size:
SMALL Slot: NECK  AC: +9 Dex: +8 Cha: +4 Fire Resist: +10 HP: +30
Mana: +45  Classes: All Classes  Races: All Races  Slot 1: Type 7
Focus Effect: Reagent Conservation III.  The mana and HPs are nice
enough.  The CHR helps you with merchant prices and perhaps with your
65 charm spell; can't speak from experience regarding that spell yet.
Toss in whatever augment you like.  
 
Seems I snipped a bit too much.  Normal level 60 LDoN wins get you
about 50 points.  Hard LDoN's get more points and better exp, but less
forgiving.  I don't do hard adventures with just any level 60+ pickup
group.  If I haven't done normal adventures with them before or they
are not in my guild, I won't do hard ones.  

One of the npc merchants in EC sells Elemental Draw for about 150 plat
-- same merchant that sells the pet shrink as I recall.
