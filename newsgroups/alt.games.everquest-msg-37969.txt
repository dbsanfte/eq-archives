You could try Oasis, South Karana, East Karana, North Karana, Lake of
Ill Omen, the Overthere, Warsliks Woods, the Warrens, Lake Rathe,
Beholder's Maze, Rathe Mountains, for outdoor zones. For dungeons, you
could try Permafrost, Najena, Upper Guk, Unrest.

yes, there are rogue quests that require high pickpocket skill. If you
have friends you can group with, they shouldn't mind too much.
Otherwise, see if you can come to an arrangement with the group; you
don't get any loot off mobs in return for your pickpocketing, or offer
to /split what you make through PP at end of hunt. Usually, most people
are playing alts and couldn't care less if you pickpocket or not, but
it's a good idea to ask first.

Yes, most nice players who play rogues feel the same way. Luckily, the
skill raises pretty quickly, really. Good luck.
