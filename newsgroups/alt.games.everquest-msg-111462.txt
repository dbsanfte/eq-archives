Actually, if he has a winmodem (or whatever they're calling the software 
modems these days) not having enough CPU could be causing the problem.  
There are a number of problems with winmodems, and they are exacerbated by 
applications which require all the resources your computer can free up, 
like EQ.  Unless you *know* that you have a hardware modem, borrow an 
external modem and see if the problem goes away.  If so, replace your 
winmodem with a real hardware modem.
