/petition them, then the GM shows up to whack their peepee,

There are many places to play. Actually, I can't even remember the last

Big whoop. What's to stop them from contimuing to harrass me?
Death isnt permanent and its not really a punishment at all. What if they
KS from me and I can't defeat them anyway?
