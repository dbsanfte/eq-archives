It used to be that you could disable the ability to inspect a player
using right-click by typing the command '/inspect off'.  Now if you
type that, you get a message saying that's not something inspectable. 
I suspect the /inspect command is now related to the traps or chests
in the LDoN dungeon and not related to inspecting players.  So is
there a new command to control player inspection?
