One thing which doesn't often get mentioned when discussing class
combinations (at least I don't see it much) is how incredibly useful
the pacify/harmony line of spells are.

My wife and I have played an Enchanter/Beastlord duo up to 62 and, more
recently, a Shaman/Necro duo up to 54. Pacify makes such a difference
to where and how we can hunt. As the Shaman/Necro we often have to
leave mobs which we'd really like a crack at because we have no easy
way to split them and know that we can't handle 4 at a time. With the
Enchanter's Pacify not only can we split camps but we can use it to
bypass mobs we don't want to fight to get to the ones which we do.

Of the three healing classes it's only Shaman who don't get any kind of
pacify although, as I'm sure your're aware, the cleric's line is more
versatile than the druid's as it doesn't have the outdoor-only
limitations of harmony. I think Pally's get Pacify too don't they?

On the subject of which duo, I'd heartily recommend either of the above
combinations though neither really fit with your current thinking of a
healer + tank.

Whatever combination you choose I hope you have fun.
