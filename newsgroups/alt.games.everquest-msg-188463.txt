| I don't know if you know this but the US economy is based around

|
| Not necessarily. In the cases mentioned missiles struck non populated

| interests. The nations involved had a choice to either say "Yeah you
| go guys! kill those terrorists" or to say "thats an act of war, if we

| would fly? Ultimately the world court, ie public opinion is what

| Again, friends and allies can disagree. It doesn't make them enemies
