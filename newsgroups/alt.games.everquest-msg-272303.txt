IMO your 2HS is perfect, you'll be very happy with this all the way to 60.  WMBS is no
longer the top tradable 2HS, but it's (I think) only 4 from the top ;->

The top tradeable (but unfortunately attuneable) 2HS for Knights appears to be Edge of
Envelopment, which is a rare drop off of Chimera Deathbringer in WoS.  Average Bazaar
price on these bad boys seems to be around 50k.  The recommended level of 66 means that,
at 50, you should wait a while before wielding it.  I have an EoE @ 60, and honestly my
DPS is not all that much better than what I was doing with my WMBS.

For 1HS, consider Blade of Disruption.  I've been seeing them for as little as 9k in the
Bazaar.  One of those, with the SBS (or Tae Ew Shield @ 51), makes for damn near 2HS DPS,
and you can still bash!  Watch the proc though - if you're on a raid where you're not MT,
a wayward stun too early in the battle could get you aggro.  The recommended level
shouldn't slow you down too much, compared to the output of your existing 1HS weapons.

For 2HB, consider Devastating Maul.  Should be nicely affordable and works like a champ.

Make sure that you get your weapon skills up to your level cap for maximum efficiency.  I
suggest that you camp Erandi Natasu, by the little pool on the way to the Hole in the
Paineel newbie area.  He is level 40, but interestingly enough should con high blue to you
at 50, drops nothing, hits like a complete wuss, has a short respawn timer, and gives
great skillup experience.

Best regards,
