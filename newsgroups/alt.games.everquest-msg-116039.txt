That brings up a good question. If you wouldn't call it "mob", what is the
proper term for it?  I've only heard the term "mob" might have originated
from "mobile" as in "mobile creature" or something like that.  What was the
original/proper term?  What is it referred to in the original style games
such as D&D?
    If you or anyone else could give some background information on any of
these terms, I'd be interested in reading it.
