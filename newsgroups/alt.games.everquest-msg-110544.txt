Piggybacking onto your reply James because I don't see T. Rose's.

I can't speak for the lvl 60 buffs specifically, but PoTG does stack with
shammy HP buffs, and with cleric Symbols and such.  Saying that no druid
buffs stack with other classes buffs is flat out wrong.  There are stacking
issues of buffs from various classes.  My shaman has buffs that won't stack
with some buffs of other classes as well.  I rarely use my AC buff because
there is usually a better one available from some other class.  I almost
always use Harness because it stacks with most, if not all, other HP buffs,
including the druid skin buffs.
