Nope, not even sure who they are.

I'm just going on what these people have told me. They never have their
facts straight and that's why I'm here trying to find out what the deal is.
they call me up in a panic telling me how EQ sent them some message telling
them how they have to basically scrap their systems in order to keep
playing.  Other places I've read up on have nothing but FUD on them and no
facts. Trying to discern the two is a challenge as a lot of people are PO'ed
and confused. As EQ keeps my pocket from being completely empty, I in no way
would discourage anyone from playing it, but I don't need to be pushing
hardware upgrades that aren't needed on people who don't have a lot of money
to work with.
