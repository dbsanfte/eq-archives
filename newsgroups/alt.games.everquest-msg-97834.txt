Ahh, a new version. Time to go test if the one time i got GM summoned 
show up now (some friend had a wedding in Lake Rathe, and gave out booze 
BEFORE telling us that is was up on top of the tower, up the ladder. It 
is NOT possible to get up a ladder while dead drunk, not even at 200 
tolerance. GM summoned me after waiting a few min)
