great, and I can tolerate someone else "feeling" that they were creative
even though they were not as creative as "I" could have been..... there was
no harm to anyone in having someone run around with a silly name like
wantsomedrinks, and a GM would have spotted that eventually

how about this, being helpful...... yanno, like your website.....

you couldnt have tried /tell wantsomedrinks you know you may want to
petition a GM to change your name as it may end up being done for you
anyhow, and at later levels you wouldnt want to start a new identity

see, something constructive... but what you have done is alienated yourself
from a game personality (like em or not, you're all on the same server)
