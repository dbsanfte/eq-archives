AAAAHHHHHHHH!  I understand now!  I suppose that since I don't hang 
around w/ 60+ enchanters at this stage, and (most important) am NOT a 
caster, it doesn't apply to me (at present...been thinking about starting 
a caster-not decided on race yet).  A lowly 20 rogue would have no use 
for it, eh?

At any rate, I thank you for the information, and will go back to my 
reading of the wit and wisodm that is this group.  Ta-ta
