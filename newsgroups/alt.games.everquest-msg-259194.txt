I don't know, I was basing this entirely on your post, which seemed to 
indicate you were using the pet's beta nuetral faction in order to pull 
singles somehow.

I don't think this will work if the pet attacks something which is 
social; the other mobs will add in defense regardless of the faction of 
the attacker.  However, it might work to single pull mobs which are KOS 
to all, but specifically -not- social.  You could send pet in to attack 
  a mob and then back it out to the group with only the target 
following, while perhaps nobody else would be able to get in range to 
pull said mob single, due to a large aggro range and pull area geometry 
preventing LOS without getting close enough for the mobs to all come.

However, another obvious way to accomplish the same pull would be for a 
monk to prox aggro the room, pull out to a long site  line spot, and 
have someone tag while he goes FD.  The mobs won't add because they 
aren't social, and they won't attack the tagger since he's out of aggro 
range.

This is merely an alternate approach to the same problem, if I'm 
understanding it correctly.

I don't see how thats a problem; strategy is about overcoming the 
enemies plans with superior plans of your own.  If the hard thing about 
a fight is the adds, you have several options; one, tank em all.  Two, 
CC em so you can fight one at a time.  Three, single pull to avoid adds.

Three is the most effective way of doing this if the mobs are difficult.

Honorable is something for your concience and your personal chivalric 
rules.  You could, for example, refuse to ever kill or help to kill any 
mob which is Ally faction to you.  I did that, and eventually ended up 
quitting the characters in question because the guilds I was in kept 
making a fuss about that.  However, to violate that rule would not be an 
exploit, it would just voilate my personal code.

Exploit, however, is an actual violation of the rules of the game; for 
example, it was until recently possible to cross Siren's Grottoe by 
logging out in a corner, then logging back in, two or three times and 
you'd appear at the succor point.  This worked because the game had 
trouble figuring out where you were supposed to be, and gave up and put 
you at the safe spot.  This was using a game error to your benefit, and 
was certainly an exploit.

It seems to me that the mobs in the strategy you are discussing are 
acting just as you would expect, knowing about faction and about pet 
faction and about such things as social and "help your buddy" aggro 
types.  I can't be sure, because I'm not certain I understand exactly 
whats going on, but if I'm right about how it works, I don't think its 
an exploit, I think its a tactic.  It might still feel dishonorable to 
you, which is fine, figure out how to do the fight without using it, 
just like I figured out how to cross SG without using the corner 
exploit... eventually (because I'm not as stuck on not using exploits as 
I am on not breaking my -own- honor code)
