Figure 1-2 hours, with a bard doing triggering and pulling for the 1 hour
figure.

Pull and kill the gardener, follow the left wall and kill roamers in your
way. Turn in perfect cherry blossom to drake, move to NW corner, pull iron
warders at doorway and in room. Move in, kill roaming iron warder in north
corridor, take corridor left to garden, kill mobs in the way to the bathhouse
to the west. Set up camp at entrance to bathhouse and kill goblins there
plus 1 roamer iron warder in your way to kirin grandmaster. I invis to kirin,
hail him, run back into bathhouse and stand inside bath to spawn Nethran,
named goblin. Pull him to group, kill him, loot thingy which I turn in to
kirin. Group moves back east to corridor north of the staircase room.
I single pull one of the guards in the pair guarding the eastern route of
the corridor, while group dispatches it and the other of the pair I run
upstairs to the library (NE-most room upstairs) where I DA in, hail the
librarian to spawn scroll thief, then I run back out and fade.
Clear the rest of the iron warders guarding the corridor until you get to
the first guarden, then I single pull the scroll thief there which is very
easy because he's mezzable. Dispatch scroll thief, loot scroll, all move
back to kirin grandmaster. You can invis through by passing between a cherry
tree and the bridge to avoid see invis pair of iron warder, but someone
usually manages to aggro them so might as well clear them.

Turn in scroll to kirin grandmaster, who turns aggro, kill him and mission
won. The only mobs that con white or higher to a level 70 is Nethran and
the grandmaster, and both spend most of their time casting so they don't
require much healing.

Free from memory so can be somewhat inaccurate.
