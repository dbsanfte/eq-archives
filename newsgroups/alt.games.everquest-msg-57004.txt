I know he misses the server, but either way - if he does take a break he
WOULD feel better about it later. I know the feeling of going where I used
to go or where I used to meet friends, I miss those times but then I realize
I should move on. I dont try to forget it, but eventually it fades out.
Doing something else completely not related would help you feel better alot
easier
