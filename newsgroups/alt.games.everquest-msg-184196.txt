Not at all. That woman is completly a fraud who is exploiting her son's
death for money! If it was a minor, it would be a little different, but even
that would be partially bad parenting. People who blame games like Quake and
Grand Theft Auto are idiots. Personally, I think those games relieve anger,
instead of taking it out on the real world. When I'm mad, I go shoot some
people in a game, not in real life.
