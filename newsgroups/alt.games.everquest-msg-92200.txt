My God, you mean they are out to make money? They're not doing it for our
benefit? NO! I always looked upon as some a parental guardian to me, I
always thought they had my best interests at heart *sob* you mean, all those
monthly subscritpions have not been put into a trust fund for me?

You Fucking Nipple. Why do Verant offer a premium service and charge more
for it? So they can make money, they see a market and exploit it. Why do
Microsoft charge for new OS when all XP really is is a few thousand bug
fixes and a new GUI on Win2k, should be a free patch but they charge you for
a whole new OS, why?Because they can, because people will pay (well,
companies will, people will copy it) and because they are in the business of
making money...I don't come to work because I know my company needs me, I
come here because I like the money they pay me, funny that and the company
doesn't pay me because it likes my sense of humour, it pays me because I
provide a service, the more beneficial the service the more they'll pay me.

So why didn't you sell your accounts for the retail price? Because you KNEW
you could get more, you knew people would pay more and they did.
