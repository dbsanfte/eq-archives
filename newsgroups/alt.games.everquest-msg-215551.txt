Just as with regular chat channels, they are player created, and there's no
official list.  There may be a list of some that are kept constantly up by
players, kept somewhere, hopefully someone will respond with its location
if there is.  But you can create your own serverwide chat channel, and you
can close it down; potentially there are millions of chat channels being
created and destroyed every day.

To join a serverwide chat channel (or create one if it doesn't already
exist) just type /join serverwide.nameofchannel

Often channels are given passwords, either to keep out the riffraff, or
more commonly to prevent someone else from taking over control of the
channel; in the latter case, the password is usually the same as the name
of the channel itself, so if /join serverwide.nameofchannel gives you a
message telling you there's a password needed, try /join
serverwide.nameofchannel:nameofchannel

One channel thats always up is serverwide.age:age, thats the
"alt.games.everquest" channel, where you can get annoying banter like you
see here, only live.
