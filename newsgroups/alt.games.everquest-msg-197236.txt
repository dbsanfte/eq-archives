Oh, ok, I think of Slow as a Slow, like I don't think of CHeal as a Heal, I
think of it as a  CHeal.  It is in the general Debuffing category, its
just...well its Slow, its actually useful and important if melee is going to
happen, as opposed to taking 5 points away from mob Str or something silly
like that.  Mmmm, Slow.

Yes but when you label a buff swap slot, you've stopped talking about "what I
normally have memmed" and start talking about "the list of buffs that I swap
in to this slot".

But I've agreed with the analysis that states I have to stop being lazy and
keeping this memmed.  My druid always kept SOW memmed, but as a shaman I'm
finding the slot real estate too valuable, I'm going to have to swap it in
and reapply frequently, in a more annoying version of the
TBoot-before-every-pull plan that my non SOW casters use.  I was hoping for a
decent spell layout that I could keep up all the time, but its not going to
happen, there's too many jobs to do in even the simplest pulling situation.

Yep.  Curse you SOE for making me unable to sleep thru the mobs!
