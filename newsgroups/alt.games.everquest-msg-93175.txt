What I enjoy doing lately is not being anon in gfay and just not
responding to all of the hilarious tells my 55 druid gets to:

1) powerlevel me, plz?

2) port me to wc, meet my friend, buff and sow us both and
port us to surefall glade, plz?

3) bind me, buff me, sow me.

I take screenshots of some of the more funny ones.

My alternative to being non anon, usually for 2 hours watching tv
while afk, is to simply respond with "no" and nothing more. People
just can't handle that.

To anyone who says, "oh yeah, well someday you might need help!" Yes,
but when I do I ask in the proper way which is to ask in /ooc instead
of personally telling people and putting them on the spot. This is
especially true if you see someone you know is a cleric or a druid but
they are anon; they are anon for a reason.

I tried the donations thing before, even to the point of buffing or
teleporting someone for donations or "Paying Well for ..." but what I
came to find out was more often than not the donation was not even
worse me zoning and "Paying well" turned out to mean 10 plat. Forgive
me, but if you know I'm level 55 "paying well" is not 10 plat. "Paying
well" would be 500 plat. I think what finally did it was going to sow
a newbie who offered a donation and gave me 3 copper... i mean come
on.. thats like tipping a waiter with some pennies.

I think I'm jaded and their the ones who jaded me.
