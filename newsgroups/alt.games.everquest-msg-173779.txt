Most clerics won't have it because its not a priority.  If the guild
does *need* it, they'll go get a few copies and give it to druids
usually, then to shaman.   That may have changed post-ICheal,
but I doubt it.

I camped RC myself, just to have it.  Never have cast it.  ("Camping"
it consisted of having my cleric logged nearby with my wife's mage
(pre-hammer days) while my wife's druid and my monk were in
Echo Caverns.   When she saw it up, we just signed on our mains,
killed it, and signed back on the alts.)   I never expect to see RGC
unless I can find some bored guildies one day who'd rather go get it
than rack up AAXP somewhere in PoP.
