In EQ1, here's basically what the expansions did (from memory, so might have
some details wrong):

1. Kunark.  Added a new continent.  Raised the level cap from 50 to 60.
Added a new race.  Added new spells and items.

If you did not purchase the expansion, you could still use the new spells
and items, if you could get someone to go get them for you.  I don't recall
for sure, but I believe you could not level past 50 unless you had the
expansion.  Note that many good items are no drop quest rewards, and so some
of the Kunark items were only available to people who actually went there,
which required getting the expansion.

2. Velious.  Similar to Kunark, but no new races and did not raise the level
cap.

3. Luclin.  Similar to Kunark, but added a new class in addition to a new
race.  I don't recall if people without the expansion could play that new
class.  Also added the Bazaar, which made a huge gameplay difference, as it
basically killed trading anywhere else.  (I don't recall when the level cap
went to 65...I think that was Planes of Power, but maybe it was Luclin).

(Somewhere in here...I don't recall where...they added alternate
advancement, basically a way to earn points that could be spent on special
abilities.  At high level, these were very important).

4. Ykesha.  Besides the usual new lands, and a new race (I *think* this was
the one that made Frogloks a playable race...), added an in-game mapping
system, and more bank slots.  (This pissed off a fair number of people,
including me, who think that expansions should not change gameplay, and if
they do change gameplay, should only do so in the expansion areas).

I think it was LoY that added better guild management tools, too.

5. Planes of Power.  I think this raised the level cap to 65.  Added new
areas.  Added the Plane of Knowledge, which had free two-way ports to nearly
every city and the Nexus, making it so people with this expansion could
travel much much much better than those without, so even if you had no
interest in the new areas (and they were for level 60+, so a lot of people
had no interest in them), this was an essential expansion for most people.

This also added "raid groups".  Even if your guild wasn't anywhere near
ready to do Planes of Power zones, there was a lot of pressure to get the
expansion for this.

6. Lost Dungeons of Norrath.  Added instanced dungeons and basically a
mission system that used them, with a point system based on accomplishing
the missions.  The points could be spent for items from special merchants.

I stopped playing around this time, so didn't pay a lot of attention to the
expansions that followed, but I think they continue in the same general way.
Somewhere in there the level cap rose again, to 70, I believe.
