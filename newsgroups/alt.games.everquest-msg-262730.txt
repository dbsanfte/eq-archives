'The argument at hand' was actually that the gaming companies sell items
instead of it being done by shady corporations.  Unfortunately one person
mentioned epics, and suddenly all and sundry are using this a reason against
the company selling items - why the hell would they sell things which are
currently no-drop on almost all servers (no idea about FV) and require a lot
of questing to get.
I think for now it is pretty safe to assume that if SoE decided to go down
this road their menu would look pretty similar to the current sellers.
I have bought most of my gear in the bazaar (legitimate plat) and am still
working hard at progression to get the later No-Drop gear in the higher
zones.  I have kept a bazaar trader up on a second account for a good deal
of time, costing me cash - I could be in the same situation had I spent that
cash on the gear and left more available in the bazaar for others.
I have no problems with people buying equipment, I do have a problem with
people blocking certain mobs indefinately, and of course buying levels which
will affect me when I find myself grouped with them.
Saying that I would not feel the need to chuck more of MY hard earned cash
into EQ, and I'd imagine my Missus would be inclined to agree.
