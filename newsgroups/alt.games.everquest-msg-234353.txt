Did I miss something, I always assumed (never tested it) that once a
pet was on a mob's hate list it will agro other mobs. Or are you just
hoping that you can hit 'pet hold' fast enough so agro doesn't chain? 

I know that when I pull with Spirit Call the mobs will agro as soon as
I cast the spell, not when the pets get there. Always assumed it was
the same way with real pets.

Strange, any idea why lower lvl pets would have less agro in that
situation?

Interesting discussion but I think there's something here that I'm
still missing. Gonna be gone for the weekend but looking forward to
picking this back up on Monday.
