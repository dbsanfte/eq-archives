(That's what I get for trying to remember the details from memory.)

Creampuff perhaps, *I'm* not soloing him.

Not raid-level, certainly, but not soloable by a 43 cleric. If he were
*that* easy the spell wouldn't be selling for 3000pp a pop. And it's not
so important to me that forming a group for that purpose is worthwhile.

I might go back and whack on him when I get my proccing hammer,
but that's a loooong way away yet. Root/nuke tactics are not terribly
effective on stunning MOBs.

        ...Ronny

(who tried the shopping quest for the first time last night and figures
he can exp twice as fast that way as by soloing. But it's slower than
grouping.)
