My guess would be Nightbane.

Are you are referring to the people trying to "bring down" the rotations 
when you say they are raising hackles?

The pre-pubescent mentality that gets exhibited in EQ never ceases to amaze 
me.  For some reason, the higher the level and more ubah the guild, the 
more you see it.

I'm sure it has to do with the people that are like this don't get the 
attention they crave in RL, so they have to try to get it in the gaming 
world.  Very sad.

Karana is a great place to game because of what the rotations allow.  There 
is 1 major problem with the rotations, and they had better get it fixed if 
they want the bints to stop what they are doing.
