At one point I had a similar problem with Kunark.  It turned out that with
installing this and installing that I had files in two different locations.
One was in \program files\everquest and the other was in \program
files\sony\everquest.  I uninstalled/reinstalled one of them and made sure
it went to the right place and that fixed it.
