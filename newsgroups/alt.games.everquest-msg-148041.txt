Ick.  Wurmslayer is an outdated weapon, weight is so outrageous
that clerics used to have to keep 'zing' spells memmed.  At this
point if someone hauls out a wurmy I just let em suffer, this is
one of the "hey look how flexible clerics are" duties I am glad
to forgo

I do agree there are better choices for weapons out there, but
was trying to work in his "pick between these" question... only
I broke that too, but I only wanted him to spend 5pp.
