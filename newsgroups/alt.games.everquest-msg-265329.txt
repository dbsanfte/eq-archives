A quick question for those who are participating in beta.

With the way XP debt works in EQ2, are folks being leery of grouping with
people they've not grouped with before?  I have this mental image of a bunch
of non-guilded people sitting in a common area spamming LFG, but not wanting
to group with a player who's an unknown quatity so as not to incur the
incremental XP debt that (as I understand it) comes with a total wipe.

I'm a bit concerned that this sort of thing might lead to a "get guilded or
get lost" attitude that would make it hard for the time limited gamer
without a guild to find a group.  But I freely admit that I might be reading
too much in to the XP debt thing.
