Unless Verant patched the Lake recently, there's no such item as a Sarnak
Ring of Station, I just took that as a typo on the original poster's part.
It's the Sarnak Earring of Station that was the primo melee earring
pre-Velious.  You're right about the price though, 10k would have been
steep even before they became outdated.
