    How many inventory slots do you need to fill, not counting toys? 20.

    How many inventory slots does a caster need to fill, not counting toys?
20. They have the exact same DKP pressure as you do, although you do have a
wider variety of toys you can get.

    Our guild is officer award, not DKP. Officers, from what I've seen,
don't count spells as a loot award unless the spell is very unique, like
Marzin's Mark off High Priest.
