Funny Bazaar story:

My wife was making and selling star ruby encrusted steins, and making quite
a good living at it.  She and the other people selling them were all at the
same price.  Life was good.

Then someone else showed up undercutting her by 50pp.  She drops her price
by 50pp.  The predicable price war happens.  The machine her mule is on is
next to my desk, so every 5 minutes (or so it seemed) she was asking me
"What's the price on the steins now?" and would tell me to lower the price
if necessary.

Eventually, this guy got so into the price war that he started selling the
steins for LESS THAN COST.

So I bought them all from him (about a dozen) and sold them myself.  Made a
tidy profit.
