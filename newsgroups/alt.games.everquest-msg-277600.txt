When they revamped MM, I think they moved various quest-related NPCs
out into LFay?  (That's what they've done with other zone revamps,
e.g. moving mobs from Droga to FM, and I know I've seen some Splitpaw
named mobs in SK.)  Did they include some non-named MM mobs as well?
If so, it's probably still fairly easy to go on a rampage for faction,
though of course you may have more trouble finding other groups of
players fighting the mobs so you might have to do all the work. :-)
