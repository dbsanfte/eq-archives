Never show them anything when they are also having you show them stuff
in a bag, in fact never show anyone stuff in a bag at all.. do it one
by one no matter how irritating. People try to set you up to have all
your spots filled so something drops via trading with bags.

If you are not selling the item though, and they ask to see stats on
some worn item after inspecting you out of the blue, you really could
just say "no.. and I'm not telling you the size of my underwear
either." Maybe they will get the point.
