Is that why they used to say if you wanted to raise your Iksar faction
you should start doing the Trooper Mozo bone chip quest when you were
dubious to him instead of waiting?  You could kill sarnaks, goblins
and outlaw Iksars to raise your Legion of Cabilis faction (Trooper
warrior guards including Trooper Mozo) to dubious but you still were
KOS to the Crusaders of Greenmist (Crusader SK guards) so you had to
do the bone chip quest to raise Crusader faction.  Supposedly if you
waited till you reached maximum faction with the Troopers before
starting the bone chip quest you wouldn't be able to raise your
Crusader faction from that quest.  Is that now fixed so you can now
raise your Greenmist faction even after maxing out your Trooper
faction?
