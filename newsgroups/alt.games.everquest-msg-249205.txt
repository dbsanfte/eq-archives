Best? Butcherblock (I assume thats where you are), East Freeport via
boat gnome, West Freeport, East Commonlands, West Commonlands,
Kithicor Forest, Highpass, Highkeep. Though odds are you will die in
either kithicor or highpass, you'll at least be nervous the whole
way....

Fastest? Butcherblock, Plane of Knowledge, Misty Thicket, Rivervale,
Kithicor Forest, Highpass, Highkeep. Skips most the dangerous parts
(zoneline in Kith to HHP is just a few feet away from RV zoneline) and
is much faster, if far more boring.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
