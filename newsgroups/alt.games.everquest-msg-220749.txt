You want to spend an hour killing fire giants just to see whether or
not Naggy is up?  Have you ever farmed haze panthers?  I could get
several good drops before you even found one Haze Panther.  You want
to take a small raid force in to the towers to find out that there is
nothing up that anyone really wanted anyway?

How do you define extraordinary effort?  Enough of an effort that *no
one* ever does it?  Most people will go out and beg a tracker to run
to these zones and check track before they would spend the time
actually making this "non-extraordinary effort".

Ever killed the though horror in ME for those gloves he drops?  You
want to run around ME looking for it?
