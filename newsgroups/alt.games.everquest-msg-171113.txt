Now, I never said I did not think he was Christian.  But various Christians
have different definitions of Christianity and I've met very few who think
David Koresh was a Christian.  I'm not Christian myself so I prefer to pass
on this particular point.  You do have to take into account that although he
considered Christ the anointed one, he also considered himself to be Christ
:)

Hmm... as I understood it, he was abusing kids and building up a private
army... that may have been just media propaganda though, correct me if I'm
wrong.  If I was mistaken then yes, he was denied his rights... but if I'm
right, then there were legal reasons completely aside from his religion that
caused the confrontation, although it could be argued the the federal
government went too far.
