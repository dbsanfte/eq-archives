These are AA related.  Everyone who puts at least 6 AA in "general" gets the
Baron/Baroness title.  After that, when you put 12 points into archetype, you get an
archetype related title, and then there are more levels when you get large numbers of
points into class related AA (you can only put points into archetype when you are a
baron or better, and you can only put points into class AA when you have your
archetype title)

I have, I'm afraid, little clue as to what titles go with which archetype or class, I
don't pay much attention to the whole thing, and would turn my own title ("baron") off
in a heartbeat if I could.
