I think the redesigns are pretty nice.  I see the same negatives you
do, though.  If I made much needed upgrades to my PC, I wouldn't be as
bothered by the hardware lag, but I can't complain, because my PC is
seriously outdated.  I agree on the lack of new content, though.  If
you're not going to add new content to draw people there, why on earth
would you have your folks working on a redesign?  I like that they
break walkthroughs.  I don't think Allakhazam and its ilk have
"ruined" the game, and I use them liberally, but mysteries were a big
part of why I loved this game the first time I played (a friend and I
spent tons of time investigating the broken quests of Kurn's tower
before they finished the iksar progessive weapon/shackle quests).

And yeah, pullulate is a word...I had to look it up :P

1. to send forth sprouts, buds, etc.; germinate; sprout.
2. to breed, produce, or create rapidly.
3. to increase rapidly; multiply.
4. to exist abundantly; swarm; teem.
5. to be produced as offspring.
