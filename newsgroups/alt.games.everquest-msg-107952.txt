There is no EXP penalty for Erudites.  There was originally a 10% EXP 
penalty for ALL INT casters.  It has been effectively eliminated close to 
2 year ago.  
Barbarians have a 5% racial penalty.  Ogres have a 15% racial penalty.  
Trolls and Iksar have a 20% racial penalty.  Halflings have a 5% racial 
bonus.  Again, there is no EXP penalty for Erudites.
