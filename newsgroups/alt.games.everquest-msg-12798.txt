The new improved Runnyeye is also full of the green mist which it wasnt
before. Inm addition you get regular messages of affectsa on you mental
state degenerating to the basic animal nature of survival (you can feel
nothing except the urge to hunt and kill), and notes on the physical
adjustment of the caves...slimes appearing etc. (note none of the messages
affect how you are in Runnyeye or Karana, they seem to be minor tone
setters).

Add to this the fact the new mobs include a big collection of fngus
creatures then the plane of decay seems to be involved ghere.
