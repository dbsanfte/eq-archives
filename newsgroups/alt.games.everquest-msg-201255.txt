I think PC has turned into what Lake of Ill Omen used to be like
before Luclin came out.  There for a while it seemed like LOIO was THE
place to go in your 20s and thus attracted a larger amount of
idiots/jerks, enough so that often people referred to it as "Lake of
Ill Manners".  Then when Luclin came out and eventually word got out
that you got much better experience in PC, everyone gravitated there. 

(it used to be the LOIO population was somewhere between 75-100--rough
guess--on a weeknight U.S. time; the last time I checked one weeknight
there were maybe about 20 people--another rough guess)
