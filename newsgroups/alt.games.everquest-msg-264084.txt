Leo. Bud. Keep your day job, heh. I think you are spot on with your thinking 
but man, I'm waiting to hear you propose permadeath next (remember the 
original Middle Earth team over at Sierra, they were fired over that one). I 
would sign up in a minute to play the games you describe, they sound great. 
But I don't believe the market wants logic or even cohesive game design, 
they seem to want a heavy dose of Instant Gratification served on top of 
Effortless Achievement, with a side of No Waiting. You should found the 
School of Logical Game Design. You'd have like two students. Everyone else 
would be attending classes on "Optimal Build Orders for Current Generation 
Fantasy RTS", or "Instant Travel Design Philosophy: Shrinking the World".

I'm in a similar bucket. I'd love to design a game sometime but based on the 
reaction I get from some of my posts on the things I do like, I think I'm 
just in an different minority than you. But still a minority.

Which is why I sent in my application today to apply for the Washington 
State Bar exam. I've lived here for years and never bothered to, but I 
finally got around to it. Apparently they don't give reciprocity with 
California (and get this: the reason is because California doesn't give 
Washington reciprocity lol). Exam is in February, let me know if you know 
any good Bar Review courses around town. And you know which bar I mean ...
