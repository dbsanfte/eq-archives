Ah, druid ring beggars.  Anyone under 25 at a druid ring gets the cold
shoulder.  I'm obviously at my keyboard and I'm just as obviously ignoring
them.  I don't take off running...why?  Are you AFRAID of them?  Are you
ASHAMED of playing a druid?  Are you afraid they'll call you bad names?

Why let them get to you in this way?

Me?  If they sit down in front of me (I have inspection messages turned off)
just looking at me stupidly and are low level I'll just stare back at them.
Then the "Hail" message.  Oh boy, someone learned where the "H" key is!  I
don't answer.
"Hail" again.
I figure pretty soon they may get to the point, or if I'm feeling especially
generous I'll go looking for that "H" key myself.  Hey, I'm a friendly guy
after all!
Then they ask me for a sow.  How anti-climatic!  I thought for sure we were
going to get into a serious debate about Halflings versus erudites!

Ah well.
