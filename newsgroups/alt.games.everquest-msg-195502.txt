I missed that, sorry.

So, about normal gearwise for a melee in those days, at least as
I remember it.

That I do not understand.  But I've only been playing a Shaman very
recently, perhaps they were a lot weaker back then.

Well, it was kinda like being a cop, long stretches of boredom between
brief moments of excitement.

Silk prices seem to be dropping, but yeah you get pp much faster
now.  It is even easier with a caster, especially if there is
competition.  I've been playing a baby Druid on an old server,
just to see what it's like.  By L7 I had an Icepaw Warclaw (or
whatever it's called), which is a 9/24 magic slasher.  He is now
L9 and has a better AC and far better weapon than Kaev had back
when he made L9.  It was pretty weird, killing willowisps by melee
with a Druid at L8 (stupid new red-con message almost killed him,
pulled with Flame Lick and did not realize that I had not started
attacking for several rounds).

Heh, I'm too damned clumsy, I've fallen at the spider bridge twice even
without anything chasing me.

I'm assuming you're advocating killing the live guards there.  I never
did, so was thinking in terms of fighting the ghouls, which proc root.
And I never have fought at zone lines much with any character, it
seems too cheap.  I love doing dungeon crawls, holding ground is fun,
pulling mobs into ambush can be fun too, but dodging back and forth
across a zone line just feels totally wrong, I haven't done it in
years.
