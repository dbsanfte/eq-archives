What the manual is referring to is the beg ability that everyone gets
innate, you go up to an NPC and if you get lucky you get some money, not
lucky, you get dead real quick (FYI-do NOT beg from guard at orc lift in
Gfay).  The manual is not encouraging you to beg from fellow players.

 Any time I'm in a newbie area and someone asks an obvious newbie question
and gets shot down in shouts, I'll send them a tell soothing them and then
track them down and buff them up, if a ranger give them advice on stuff to
do,  if I have anything I was gonna store on my alt I'll sometimes give to
them.  I had some good experience in Gfay when I first started with people
who gave me good advice when I asked so I try to give back when I can.  I'll
even make a special trip home and sit around the newbie lift helping out for
a day.  I'm partial to Gfay cuz that's where I started.  When I started a
Vah shir, I worked on the quests and learned a few of the starting quests
for them, while I was there I helped some newbies that were brand new to EQ.
I still talk to them even tho I no longer play my vah shir as often.  If you
are nice to people they will be nice to you.  Don't respond to idiots who
shout stupid stuff.  You can put them on ignore and not bother with them
ever again.  Don't forget this is a family game and some players will be
younger than anticipated, they are way immature and don't care about
etiquette one bit.  Just ignore the idiots and if you aren't having fun in
one area, go somewhere else, there are plenty of other places to go at any
level.

Good luck
