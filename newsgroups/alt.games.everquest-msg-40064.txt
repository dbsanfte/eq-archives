As a cleric, I have (so far) three roots; root, enstill, and immobilize.

Root is cheapest, enstill costs more, immobilize still more.

Root lies in the middle in terms of max duration and cast time,
enstill lasts the longest but takes the longest to cast,
and immbilize casts the quickest but also lasts the least time.

Which do I cast?  Well, it depends what I'm doing; if I'm
root parking mobs that need to stay put for a long time and
noone is going to bother them, enstill.  If mana is of the essence
and time rooted isn't all that important, root.  But....

Immobilize casts faster.  So I almost always use it.  Yes, it
costs three times as much mana as root, but heck, I live.

Here's the thing, if you are using root and nuke tactics, every
time you hit the mob with a nuke it gets another chance to
break root... so long duration isn't an issue unless you are
end up needing to med up more mana in order to start nuking
again.
