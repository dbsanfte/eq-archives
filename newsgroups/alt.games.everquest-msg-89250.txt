Hmmm... I guess I have to shift my point of view a little:
I think we do not need any more classes in this game.
There is one game I know of that has a real bunch
of race/class combos, which is Wizardry (7), which
also has ninjas, samurai and monks, and it just shows
that the most important thing for a fantasy game
(if not for any game) is the atmosphere and storyline,
notï¿½necessarily in that order and not necessarily
as two separated points. Wizardry 7 was the
best rpg I had ever played up to that day, though
the downtime didn't make it my favourite one.
Ultima Underworld came close, though.

And then there was Might & Magic 3 -
Great Engine, talking about playability
and fun. Forget parts 4 & 5, but then
came 6, 7, and 8 (didn't get a chance
to play 9 yet - is it out?) - this game had a really
cool atmosphere and the story was awesome,
especially in 7, where you could choose sides.

The best way to improve EQ imho is to
create(/modify) zones with(/to have) an atmosphere like
the crystal caverns in Velious for example, or even
more so the 2nd story of the tower of Frozen Shadows
in Iceclad (haven't been farther yet ;) - or - can you say
"Unrest"? :)

Then they need to create several "grey zones" between
good and evil realms, where the good and evil npc's
regularly fight for the zone and the players can help
their faction to win the battle, and after that the zone
(including merchants) is on the faction of the winning
party - until the next fight :)
Would only be fun if you didn't lose faction in such events.

And how about escort missions? Close but not quite like
the ringwars in Velious? I once did something like that
in a GM event - didn't stay online long enough to get
a reward, but it was more than worth the fun alone:
Try to escort a spoiled "royal" (her cousin was married
to some minor prince, I think) high elf brat from South Ro
to he Docks in East Freeport, with her continouusly
stopping to admire the "cute kittens" and then asking why
they would bite her - running down a dune and not
understanding why she would tumble down and get injured.

More GM-controlled events maybe - other than just
senseless slaughter of players til they finally succumb
to overwhelming force.
I haven't had laughed like in that event I described for a long
time... Well - now, of course - those laughs are more common,
my guild is the weirdest bunch of cool people I have ever
found in EQ :)

Just some ideas...
