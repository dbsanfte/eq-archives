I use a NetGear MR314 (replaced with, I believe, the 814) wireless router. I
have had absolutely no problems with it. I have four systems attached to it
(2 direct desktops, one wireless laptop, one wireless PocketPC). The two
desktops run EQ, usually at the same time. I have never had a lag,
disconnect, latency, or any other problem.

In fact, when my wife and I are in a group, and we zone with others, we
usually arrive first and have to wait for the rest of the group to arrive.
