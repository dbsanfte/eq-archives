Yesterday, I decided to turn off all the new models except for the
three that my character himself uses.  I was amazed at the improved
performance.  The time needed to change zones was cut in half, and all
the choppiness I've been getting was gone.  It's kind of a shame
though because I liked the new models.  They definitely aren't worth
the performance hit I've been experiencing though.

I haven't had a chance to see what it's like under raid conditions,
but I'm guessing it will be a huge improvement there.

Oh yeah, just for reference, I'm running a 1.2 Ghz Athlon, 512MB RAM,
and a GF3.
