The new graphics engine has degraded performance for me to a more or less 
unplayable state, and I'm pretty tired of all the bugs it introduced. I 
guess I just don't want to pay to be a beta tester anymore. So, I've 
canceled my account for now. May come back later, may not, depending on how 
some other MMOG's I'm interested in turn out. I don't have any "stuff" 
worth having so don't bother asking. :)

Cyas,
