This was a work-around for an exploit related to FD. You used to be
able to return to the same character almost immediately if you went LD
and wound up at the server screen. Apparently, if you /q'd out while
FD, then logged back into the character, you would have a corpse on
the ground with duplicates of all your items. Seems they couldn't fix
it so they did this as a work-around.
