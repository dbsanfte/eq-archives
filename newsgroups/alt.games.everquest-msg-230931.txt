Yep, this was CODecay, also a teir two zone, people are chatting about 
how much AA exp they are getting and I'm thinking to myself "I'm doing 
that well on Real exp!".  Fantastic really, this is the first character 
I've taken thru 60 since POP release; my cleric did most of 60 pre pop 
knowing that the additional levels were coming.

A lower level mage guildmate asked if I'd gotten any spells he should 
buy from me (I think he'd have liked me to give them to him, actually, 
but I need to recoup the money spent on parchments to try more) and I 
said I'd been a fool to buy any at all, my advice is to keep an eye on 
parchment prices, buy them when they come up cheap, and do hand ins till 
you have most of the spells for your class, only buy the ones you need 
to fill in.

This is of course terrible advice in that it kills the market for spell 
resales; who's going to buy my common extras if everyone follows the 
same plan.  So I'd only give it to friends or guildmates; fortunately 
there don't seem to be any other high level mages in AGE on FV.

Some days I care more about that than others.  Wrote most of it late at 
night, till I got too sleepy to finish, did the rest on waking up; 
neither "about to get keyboard tattoo" nor "what am I doing up so early" 
are condusive to proofreading.

Umm, I should note that I didn't get killed clearing, it was somewhat 
later while we were killing reavers, Lord Rak popped, they told the tank 
not to aggro it till we were ready, so of course he did, and.. things 
didn't go too well.

Since I don't have enough of a buffer to stay 61 till rezed, I was 
forced to fall back on my mere level 60 prowess.

I can do another 100 hp or so by adding in a full set of focus items, 
right?  I hardly ever bother doing this, its such a pain because the 
items are lore, but since the 61+ focus items have identical AC and HP 
(and mana) as the 50+ lot, I can summon a full set of the lowbie ones to 
bring along.  Full plate, belt, weapons, full set of foci, lev ring... 
anything else I can summon to bump it up a notch?

Heh, I've yet to see him enrage, hasn't ever been that hurt before. 
Nice to know he can, I'll have to play with that some.

Again, I ask, what would make me go for Fist or Kedge over the 61 blade, 
on the surface they look pretty much identical (performance wise).

Should be easy to check melee increase, just give one to a level 4 pet 
and kill newbie zone mobs.  10 damage should mean max hit of 20, if he's 
doing any more than that he's using the elemental damage.

I've also heard that these don't proc for low level pets, anyone know 
the level of pet that they will proc for, and what that corresponds to 
in terms of caster level for each class?  For example, the druid pet is 
what, level 29 (although the druid has to be level 56)?  Is that high 
enough?

Oh, so its set damage per level, but the amount goes up from 61 to 65? 
This would mean at 61 its only 1580 damage, so doing the same math, 3.57 
damage per mana, actually worse than Shock of Firey Blades which I 
calculated on same assumptions as 3.68 damage per mana, on the other 
hand at 65 its 4.51 damage per mana, nice indeed (if not outclassed by 
even better spells by then)

Ahh, that makes much more sense, I thought the cost was incredible for a 
group spell.  Well, I'm happier this way really, as my main use for DS 
is either soloing or on just the MT plus my pet, and a group DS won't 
hit my pet.

No idea what quest you are talking about.  I imagine soloing dot casters 
would want this item, I'm talking about in exp groups... or raid groups, 
but I've been on very few raids with mage so I can't say about that; BA 
seems to be one of the least popular mage focus item lines.

I'd love to see a rundown of percentages with hundreds of spells handed 
in.  Which ones are rare, which are common, or is it really all the same 
chance and just a streaky RNG?

Splendid
