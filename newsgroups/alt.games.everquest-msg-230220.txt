Hmph.  I had to get myself killed the other day cos I had a train of Orc 
Legionnaires (that's weird, BTW, since when did Orcs speak French?) 
snapping at my heels all the way to the Crushbone entrance...  And when I 
get there I find a trio of low-levels hanging around in the tunnel, bless 
'em.  So of course I had to turn round and take my train back out into the 
zone where they'd have time to chill out after murdering me (which they 
duly did)...

Nobody's fault, mark you, I'm not complaining, just one o' them things.

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
