You can try Guildmagic...I have gotten one email from some guild that 
was recruiting on my server that originated from Guildmagic.

Or you can look around at the people you group with..are more than one 
of them in the same guild?  Ask for web addresses for thier guild and 
find out about the guild.  Don't jump for the first one unless you 
really like that person.  You may get stuck with a group of people you 
can't get along with.

Your server may have a guild listing page on it's official website.  Is 
there are an official site for Rathe?
Try putting the server name and the word guild in a websearch. Worth a try.
Or you can just stay guildless for a while.  If you stick around enough, 
people will ask you to join thier guild, or you can ask to join.
Good luck
