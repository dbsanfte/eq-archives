2 points here.

First one I'd have to disagree; it may actually be a correct
determination that his need overrides theirs.  It's a situational
call.  For instance, if 3 people are injured in an aircraft and one of
them is the pilot, then his need for immediate medical attention
almost invariably should override the needs of the other 2 people.

The second one I will agree with.

Never said anything about someone else providing.  Lance's basic
premise was that Need = Greed; if you need something, you're greedy.
I'm saying that it's possible to need something without being greedy.
That L40 warrior needs a weapon.  That doesn't make him greedy.

(Yes, he may *also* be greedy, but *needing* a weapon doesn't
automatically make him greedy.)
