yeah, i realize all that.  But..I've been thinking of sending in the 
money next month, I'll have a little extra from a windfall then.  Now, 
I'm not so sure I really want to.  I feel that the unauthorized downland 
and installation is a way to force my hand and I don't like being forced 
to do anything.  I've put up with the popups for a while, I'll just have 
to be more vigilant and turn on my pop up stopper programs before I go 
to that site from now on.
