You know what? It's people like you, who seem to have nothing better to do
with their time other than to pick on someone after a few spelling and
grammatical errors, that scare people away from Newsgroups. This is meant to
be a place for sharing information about a game we all seem to enjoy. I've
been playing EverQuest for about a week now and I still have so much to
learn, yet people have always been more than willing to advise me when I
ask. Leave the guy alone and do something more constructive with your time.

I didn't see any part of the post asking you to read it.

Stevie.
