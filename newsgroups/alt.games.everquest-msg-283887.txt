I find this an interesting comment since most people I talk to in-game
have the same opinion; no need for healing in an LDON, just DPS.

Personally I have found this to be accurate in the extreme.  Our
normal group consists of:

warrior
berserker
bard
wizard
necro

Not a healer in sight and we own LDON's.  So fast sometimes that we
beat the lockout timer (that was a shocker the first time it happened,
I didn't know there was a lockout timer).  Our personal best was 19
minutes, no healer.  Heck the necro didn;t even use his weak-ass
heals, though the bard did sing his regen song alot.

My point is that the traditional concept of a "balanced" group is
thrown out the window when it comes to LDON's.  But you do need alot
of DPS.
