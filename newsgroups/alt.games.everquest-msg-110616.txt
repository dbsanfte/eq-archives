Hehe, have you seen their druid suggestions? They say agi is nice for
every single race, so a 65 str and 95 agi is told to add 25 points to
wis and 5 points to agi. Hey, who cares about encumberment if you have
100 agi? Bah. (My druid added 20 to wis and 10 to str instead :) )

Anyway, if you should want to get some agi gear for your wizard (even
though they are right that you'd never get good ac on a wizard no
matter what you do :) ), advisor robes and crystalline robes both have
+2 agi, silversilk leggings have +4 agi, kobold hide boots have +3
agi, wolf fur slippers have +7 agi and +20 mana. Loam encrusted armor
has a fair chunk of agi on several pieces as well.
