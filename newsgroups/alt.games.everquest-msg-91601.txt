No because it's not true. The whole point of Sleepers, the *reason* VI
programmed it that way, was that they wanted an action to have an impact
on the world for once. 

VI have stated that there is no quest to re-capture the sleeper, nor are
there any plans to implement one in the future

Sleeper was awoken on Zeb over 3 months ago. I know, because I was the
MT. "Last �% of the gaming experience"? You mean missing out on a select
few phat items? All of the warders in ST had generic dragon models you
can see wandering around WW any day of the week. 'Participating' in a
dragon fight in ST, is much the same as 'participating' in a dragon
fight in ToV. MotG and Prog are still there. Primal is still there.
First Broods are never killed on Zeb for their keys any more. Seems more
like a 'dog in the manger' attitude to complain about something you're
not working towards and aren't ever likely to experience yourself?

If it's not specifically about missing out on 'phat lewts', please
explain how you missing out on farming a few generic dragons, was more
important on what we would've missed out on if the sleeper was still
sleeping? Missing out on releasing a uniquely modelled dragon, into a
specially run script run across many zones (something no other mob has
ever done), revealing previously undiscovered history between Norrath's
key characters, including an epic battle between the Sleeper and Lord
Yelinak.

>and the chance of getting some
>Primal.

Primal still drops in ST. The only things that don't drop are the warder
specific items. 

SoDs will no longer drop, but there are several superior weapons out
there already. By the time you get there, there will be even more.
Gnome masks were a toy, with no actual benefit other than looks.
