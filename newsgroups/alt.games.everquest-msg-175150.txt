Sorry but all that is written is not so . The only evidence I will accept to
change my mind is actual sniffer data :) Preferably ones installed above
motionless mixers near factories or cities .

Also the only pollution those articles are bitching about is carbon dioxide
which is one of the absolute tamest of pollution compounds. Global warming
tied to such emissions is still hotly debated among climatoligists and the
carbon dioxide theory of global warming completely fails to explain such
phenomena as the warming tempature on mars.

I will however gladly endorse the building of nuclear power plants thus
allowing the shutting down of oil and coal power plants reducing carbon
dioxide emission dramatically in the US.
