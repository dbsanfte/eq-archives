Simple:

Get in a group around peeps your level of different races. Set up a hotkey
of a phrase of some sort (any phrase, doesn't matter what). Then have
everyone turn on their native tongues, and just repeatedly hit the hotkey I
suggested. So long as the peeps you're "language bombing" with are around
your level, you should see significant language skill increases for the
respective tongues. Hopes this helps.
