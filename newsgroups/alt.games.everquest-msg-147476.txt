Over my my playing Everquest ive gathered a few things which i find 
useful to have in my backpack.
I was wondering what others carry around with them and maybe couldnt be 
without?
I realise this question depends on a lot of things. How much cash you 
have, what level you are, what race and class etc
But id be interested to know what other people like to always have with 
them
I have things like a compass and +charisma item, sow potions, spell 
components etc
