Paid a visit to the newly Liberated Citadel of Runnyeye, yesterday. I
thought I'd have a look around, hoping to pick up some black alloy for some
friends, figuring they'd be no one in there (520 players in total on
Bristlebane at the time)
Everything looked different from what I remembered so I grabbed the new maps
and set about looking around. At 43rd I still get aggro'd by many of the
goblins a lot of which are casters and dished out plenty of damage. I died
once while in there. Did gets some black iron and black alloy (got a black
alloy girdle which is actually better than what I was wearing, LOL, I
haven't worn an item I've looted since BlackBurrow) I was the lowest level
in the zone for most of the time only becoming 2nd lowest when a 21st Pally
entered as I was leaving.

I was wondering, has anyone here actually hunted there for exp? From what I
have heard it's only been used by players farming the items and I believe
that a group of mid to high 20's (30 is meant to be the zone limit altho
Lord Picklaw is blue to me) would really struggle in that dungeon.

Personally I'd rather it was a little easier (I maybe wrong about how tough
it is for a full group but there is plenty oppotunity to get add after add
hunting there and I was often on the verge of death) and they had used the
Warren's looting rules (of course this would have meant I'd have got no
Black alloy but I'd rather that than see 2 50+ camping the King room)

Any comments
