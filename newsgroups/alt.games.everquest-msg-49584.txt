Are you kidding?  The snow bunnies are great exp from 3 to 5 solo,
I'm sure a group of first and second levels could take em too.  Get
a bind in Kael Drakkar and have a blast.  Helps that you lose no
exp dying at under 6th, of course, since the mobs you are evading
while hunting the wily rabbit are certainly able to kill you simply
by glancing in your direction....
