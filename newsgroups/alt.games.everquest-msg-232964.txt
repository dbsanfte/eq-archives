 We clear it in one day. Actually, all the guilds in there (4) are now
down to a one day clearing. A Japan guild (Actually it was a joint thing
between two different guilds, so I'm curious as to how a co-raid between
2 guilds works with Time's instancing. I think it's more raid specific
than guild specific though so they should be ok) just got in there and
they're trying to figure out what to do. So in reality we have 5 guilds
in Time at the moment. 2 other guids are only Rathe and Rathe/Coirnav
away, respectively. Things will get a little more interesting when that
happens. Especially since one of those is also another co-raiding
situation. And they regularly have more than 85+ people on their raids.
So they'll be in for an awakening if they think they're going to zerg
their way though Time like they did all the other encounters. I guess
they'll have to figure out who to leave behind when they squeeze their
20 cleric squad through.

 We don't really have the problem with finding targets outside of Time.
We're taking it a little easier now that we actually made it to Time and
'won' the game. It feels good not to have to log on everyday for once.
We hit some of the gods if they're up. There's also LDon raids. Although
most people are coming around to despising LDoN raids. I know I am. Who
ever came up with most of those should be fired. Although rumor has it
that the person who was responsible for the LDoN raids is the same one
who designed the GoD raid content. I hope GoD raids aren't like LDoN or
we'll probably have a lot who quit the game at that point.

 As far as the bugs go... There was a problem with GoD beta people a
couple weeks ago where it would mess up the instancing. At least that's
what we were told by the devs. Other than that things work fine. 

 The main problem with Time instancing has to do with ending it
properly. The guild that kills Quarm should free Zeb to end the instance
the right way. Otherwise it keeps running, which could be a long time
and screw up other people. Mainly those in opposite time zones, like
Japan guilds. 

 Each instance is roughly 13.5 hours long (1 hour Phase 1, 1 hour Phase
2, 1.5 hours (not certain) Phase 3, 4 hours Phase 4, 4 hours Phase 5, 2
hours Phase 6 (Quarm)). And this time is cumulative. So if a guild plows
through it in 6 hours, and doesn't end it properly (by freeing Zeb),
that means their instance keeps running 7.5  more hours until it times
out. So anyone going in there at that time would go into the previous
guilds instance after phase 1. Which would be an empty Quarm lair.
However, this also works both ways, to the clearing guilds disadvantage.
Say that they get to Quarm but are losing too many people so decide to
call it for the night. And they still have 7.5 hours on their instance?
Guess what? Yeah. The next people to come in can theoretically 'steal'
your instance if the time hasn't expired yet. Meaning they could end up
at Quarm just by clearing Phase 1 (Actually not sure about having to do
Phase 1. Although I'm fairly certain they'd have to do it). They
probably wouldn't be able to kill him, but they'd have an opportunity to
at least attempt it a couple times and learn some things about the
encounter before they've actually earned the right to do so by
progressing through the rest of the Phases.

 So, to summarize: Time is instanced. But it's not fully instanced like
LDoN. If SOE would go ahead and do that it would really end most of the
problems people have run into. I'm not sure any server has 7 guilds in
Time yet. But we are close to that point. Hopefully GoD will get the top
2-3 to leave. But I doubt it. Unless GoD loot makes Time loot loook bad.
But I doubt that will happen. So in the meantime there's really too many
loots in Time to ignore. A full clearing yields 44 loots. Not as much
once you do it awhile and Phase 1 loot starts rotting. But that's only 5
items which leave 39 left. 39 decent loots are  really worth the 7 hours
or less it takes to clear.
