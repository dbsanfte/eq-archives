Dan, you really need to put aside the notion that dungeons are the 'final
frontier' or are 'where all the veterans go'  in EQ or where all the 'smart'
people go (to paraphrase you above).  Your tone is rather insulting to
people who like playing outdoors rather than indoors in dungeons.
Personally I've had a belly full of single-player, first-person, dungeon
rompers over the years and find endless enjoyment hunting in the absolute
myriad of Everquest's detailed and visually attactive outdoor zones.

Mild flame I guess, nothing personal, I just think that there is no need
insulting the huge number of 50+'s out there that have never stepped foot in
a dungeon and enjoy hunting the many vast, rich, and detailed outdoor areas
EQ has to offer.  Does this make them unskilled in group efforts?  I think
you know that's not true at all.

Let me stand by for 10 minutes in a high level dungeon as each class plays
their part and I will guarantee I won't see any character do anything I
haven't already seen practiced in good pickup groups outdoors.

Extra skill/more 'smarts' to play a dungeon enchanter?  a bard?  a warrior
you say?  Complete and utter hogwash.
