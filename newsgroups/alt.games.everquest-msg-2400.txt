What is the exact formula for determing what percenatge of full experience
you get when killing a mob
SOLO.

  Exactly how does the mob being  3, 4, 5 levels above or below you effect
the amount of experience you get.

       It seems I get experience from some monsters  /con  ing green.
What is the formula or do you have a link to a site.  I could not find one


In GROUPS
Also, How does the level of other players in my group effect my experience.
I know if they are many levels above or below me, either my experience or
there's goes down.

Filling out a party give you a bonus.  So even though there is one more to
split the exp with the bonus makes up for it.  What exactly is the bonus %?
