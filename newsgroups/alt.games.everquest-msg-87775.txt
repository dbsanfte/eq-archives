Ya know, this whole fiasco has shown me that no matter how old or
*experienced* you think you are in life, there are always lessons to be
learned.

Watching the 2 Canadian skaters talking to the media about this in an
interview I saw last night I learned something else that I had perhaps
forgotten somewhere along the line;  It's not win or lose it's how you play
the game (or for some, it's just *being* in the game).

Sale and her partner said basically 'shit happens' and they just love figure
skating.  I was as angry about it as you, maybe even outraged at what
transpired that evening - and then to see them sitting there (and I do
believe honestly) saying that you have to move on and they're in it for the
skating - well, for me those words were more inspiring in light of what
they'd been through than the most flawless skating routine performed by any
collection of the best skaters in the world.

Cheers to Canada for offering up the world a class act like those 2 skaters
who, inspite of the crooked judges and under-the-table tradeoffs, manage to
remain in-love with their sport and know who really won the gold medal that
night, with the rest of us.
