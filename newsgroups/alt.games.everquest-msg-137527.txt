Where is the thievery here? You can't be serious. It doesn't have to
be against the rules to be wrong.

Duh, no, who is VI? Blatant rhetoric. The social aspect is *far* too
integral to the game for this kind of departure from common decency.
You know it's not yours, and it's easy to determine if someone is
coming back for it, yet you are perfectly willing to relieve someone
of their property against their will. Sounds like theft to me,
regardless of the *official* policy. Verant doesn't impost moral
restrictions. It's up to us to do that.
