See my response to the other guy for why I think druids should get cheal :p

In answer to whether we take complete idiots , yep we do. In our defense I
think most other high end guilds do as well . The trick is to keep enough of
them focused on the task at hand and not doing something stupid . Kicking
people out , making them wait for rezzes, laughing at there complete
incompetence over guild chat , remarking to all the people dead well that
time it was X who killed everyone. All of these and more are used and
required to keep the idiots paying attention. Oh and every once in awhile
each of us is an idiot :)
