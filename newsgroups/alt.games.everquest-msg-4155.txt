You were absolutely not in the least bit wrong. If someone wants to
lay claim to a spawn, the *only* way they can do that is to actually
be fighting the spawn. Sending some lackey to stand there staring at
it doesn't mean squat.

>they couldn't say they were camping him all day.

Even if the enchanter had been standing there all day, if *he* wasn't
going to attack Dyllin, then you were perfectly within your rights to
do so.

I hope they did petition you - I'm sure some guide would have gotten a
real laugh out of it while telling them what idiots they were.
