Hi All;

I'm trying to help a friend by posting a question here. He's a 63 chanty
just starting his epic. He does very little reading and knows I enjoy
reading and learning from the EQ Newsgroup. He asked me to help with this
question.

In Burning Woods he turned in the 3 items to the Jeb Lemused mob. Got the
coin. He turned in his 3 things and while doing the dialog he accidentally
skipped over the question/dialog concerning the Enchanters Bag and didn't
get the bag. He still has the coin. Does this whole series have to be done
again or is there another way to get the Enchanters Bag or does he
absolutely have to have it?

I hope I phrased the question good enough for you to tell what part of the
epic he's in.

Thank you all in advance for your time and help.
