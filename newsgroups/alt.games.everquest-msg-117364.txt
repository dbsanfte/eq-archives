It's a very tough and arduous quest to get these items, you have to trek to
far away places, and give some NPC hard earned plat in order to receive
these items.

Check out www.eqtraders.com, look under tradeskill supplies, you will find
where you can complete this quest.  For the Velium bars, the only place is
Thurgadin, for most of the other components, there are suppliers in most
cities.

Oh, and don't give them the plat, they are merchants, and they will happily
sell you the components.  Velium bars cost 260ish plat as I recall.
