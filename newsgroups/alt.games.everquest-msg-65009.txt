<<snip report of bard songs being broken>>

I've found that certain zones have working bard songs.  I had no
problems in Akheav Ruins, other than some really long lag-freezes.  It
appears that songs that affect mobs work regardless, and it's just
buff songs that don't work.  I suspect that it is related to the group
buff problems all casters are seeing.  The will be rolling patches
tonight, hopefully fixing this issue.

ack!  selos broken, bard in trouble!
