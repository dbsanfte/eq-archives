Check your sense heading and /locs in OOT, you'll find that when you get 
on the boat in BBM and zone into OOT, you'll be on the west side of OOT 
heading east to get to Freeport.  I imagine people would start griping 
if they stealth switched it to the correct orientation.  Been around at 
least a year and a half, proly since the beta days, but that's all I can 
vouch for.
