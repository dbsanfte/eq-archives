I thought he said where is Thurgadin..not what is it?.  Reasonable question
to me with all the new zones for the 30 to 50 crowd now.

Besides I am one of the EQ'ers who does not have the Vellious expansion.
And am sure there are more just like me in the 400k subscribers eh?

Not everyone are cool and own all the expansions like you Jazz, lol
