I hadn't thought about that.  The LoS issues with FoT were enough to make it
just an occasional tool instead of my bread and butter nuke.  With the LoS
issues gone, and the fact that you could also save mana on rains, evocation
makes a tempting choice.

Some things going for conjuration

1. Your conjuration nukes give you two resists to work with, assuming you
get to 65 and get both Black Steel and Sun Vortex.  In addition, they cast
faster than FoT and Sun Vortex has a slightly better damage/mana ratio than
FoT (IIRC).  They also cost less mana, so if you're in the position I was in
sometimes - basically OOM and trying to get another nuke off ASAP, you
should be able to get BS or SV off quicker than FoT.  Because they use less
mana, a resist is also less costly with your conjuration nukes instead of
FoT.

2. Your 60 and 64 pet heals are conjuration.

3. Item summonings are conjuration.  While they don't take up a lot of mana
individually, doing a number of sets can suck up a lot of mana.  You
probably won't be doing these summons in a hot situation, but they may
increase your downtime before you can get into that hot situation.

4. Mod Rods are conjuration.  If you or people you group with use them
regularly, then you're saving a little mana on a regular basis.

Those benefits to conjuration aside, I would probably be changing to
evocation except for one thing - SOE is perfectly capable of letting bolts
work as is for six months or more, then changing them back to the old way
with no warning.  They did that with pet-canni, left it in the game for
years, had a rep go to the mage boards and say they had no intention on
changing it in the near future, then changed it three months later with no
warning to mage community.  You can certainly do the quest to change your
specialization back to conjuration at that point, but I did it once and
maxxing your specialization again takes a long time.
