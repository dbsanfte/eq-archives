I know they say they fixed the faction-loads-slow-on-zoning bugs, but
perhaps they didn't catch all the cases.  For those that don't recall those
bugs, basically what would happen was that after you zoned (or logged in),
sometimes your character would enter the world before the server had
received your faction information from that database, and so would figure
your faction based purely on race/class/religion.

So, for example, if you were a non-Iksar who had worked hard to get non-KOS,
and camped out next to the newbie guards in, say, FOB, you could find that
when you logged back in, you were KOS again for 10 or 15 seconds.  Once the
guards aggro, it doesn't matter when the faction information finally gets
loaded...they don't say "Oops...my mistake.  Sorry about that" and stop
attacking. :-)  Worse, if you had a slow system, your character could enter
the world and be killed by the guards before you even got control.  Even
worse was when someone would bind near a guard that had been KOS to their
base race/class/religion faction...nasty death loop.

At one point, Verant fixed this by changing it so that for a short time
after zoning, you were indifferent to everything.  That was interesting.  My
DE Wizard normally can't buy/sell in the Ogre home city (they have no
problems with Dark Elves...but those stupid Ogres won't deal with Wizards!).
However, if I would zone in and run straight to the nearest merchant and try
to open their inventory, it would work if I got there during the
"indifferent to everyone" phase.  This leads to obvious exploits.  Want to
do a quest that requires indifferent or better, but are only dubious?  Bind
next to the quest giver, and do the quest steps immediately after gating.

I don't recall what happened next, but I *think* they undid the "everyone
indifferent" kludge, and instead fixed the communication between the
database server and the world servers so that the faction information wasn't
delayed.
