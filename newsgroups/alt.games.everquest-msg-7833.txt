I suppose I could take a lesson from the bizbee school of kill-filing.  All
I would have to do is make a big, public stink about putting some "moron"
(anyone that disagrees with me I reckon) into my kill-file.  Of course I
would then have to follow it up with some boisterous chest-thumping heavily
laden with hypocrisy.  You know, anything that makes me look like a complete
fool for kill-filing someone else for doing what I was doing all along
should work.
