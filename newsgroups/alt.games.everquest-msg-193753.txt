Sounds like it's time for him to /guildremove.

Guilds certainly make things easier and usually make the game more 
enjoyable, but you have to find one that suits you well.

Some people like guilds that raid every night, some people like more casual 
family style guilds that only raid once or twice a week and help each other 
with quests and such.
