    Ok, let's. Druid chaining WF, 172 DPS. Wizard chaining Draught of E'ci,
181 DPS and a minus 50 resist mod (so the DPS gap will end up being even
bigger than what the raw spell data predicts). Wizard outdamages druid with
cold nukes, period.

    Again, You Are Wrong. If you're talking about damage over time, Draught
of E'ci does more damage chain-cast than WF. If you're talking about max
damage on a single cast, Ice Spear of Solist or Ancient Destruction of Ice,
with Iceflame of E'ci up, will both land for more than WF (1560) when they
land for max.

    They must have said that after Kunark came out, because in the original
game, you had the second best Fire nuke and not by much. Magician's Lava
Bolt, 810. Conflagration, 622. Druid's Starfire, 612.
