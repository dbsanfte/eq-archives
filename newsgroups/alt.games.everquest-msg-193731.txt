If it's not too late, I would switch to a DDR memory platform. It
should be cheaper and will be more "future proof". RDRAM is going the
way of the dinosaur, and it is too expensive. In fact I believe there
are regulars in this group that have had huge hassles upgrading RDRAM
machines in the past.

Switching to DDR might also allow you to buy 1gb of RAM for the same
price or less.
