I have the exact opposite view . I believe that the dragon kludge was one of
the worst decisions that they ever made . I see that decision propagating
now and if there is any chance of slowing there headlong plunge into such a
despicable unrealism I will take it.

If a mob drops loot representing more worth than the effort involved then
nerf the loot or raise the difficulty . If people are standing around all
clamoring for the same mob then decrease its spawn time , make it triggered
, or increase the number of them .

If you create items that anyone would want and dont let players who are
entirely capable of getting them in the normal course of events then you set
the stage for squabbles . The problem with vox and naggy was that the loot
was exceptional and the spawn time was extreme . A much better solution
would have been to decrease the loot percentage and  increase the spawn rate
. A naggy spawn every 8 hrs that drops just one item would be FAR preferable
to the garbage they have now .

If you create items that anyone wants and only low players can get then one
of three things happen . The items act as a transfer payment from older
players to younger players allowing younger players a far easier time of it
and thus ruining the game for them . The older player will kludge around the
rules in someway going to great additional trouble . The player will say to
hell with it and either do without the item or quit in general disgust over
how things are going .
