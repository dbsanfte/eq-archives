He's not off-base; his complaints are largely valid for the low-end game.
It's something we ignore because the low-end game is over so quickly,
by our standards, but if he can play the game for twenty hours and find
nothing to hold his interest... there is a problem.

Being unable to figure out how to play... I raised that as an issue
because much of the variety between classes is poorly documented, affecting
his *perception* of the game. In planting the hook of EQ addiction,
perception is vital. My point about the high end was similar; he saw the
game as dull *because* so much of the content is only visible at the high
end.

Basically for the part of the game that he saw his points were valid, and
telling somebody that they have to play for another two months before
they see the interesting parts is just silly.

...and I got a little tired of everbody sassing the guy when he had a
point. I don't agree with everything he said, but I *do* see how a
completely new player could see things that way.

        ...Ronny
