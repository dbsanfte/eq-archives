My necromancer just got a dual wield pet.  I ran and bought a couple
of 1hs (cheap) swords and armed him with them.  During a particularly
bad pull, lost my pet, feared the mob, cast new pet, then finished off
the mob.  It seemed to me that the new pet hit for just as much
unarmed as the dual wielding sword swinging pet ?   Is there really
any diff when arming a pet with weapons ? And last, does your pet take
on the stats of a weapon, meaning I could raise his AC etc with
particular weapons ?
