I've been trying to get this quest done for some time.  I finally have 5 of
the bard pieces (ceramic dagger sleeves) made up and ready to trade to the
other 4 classes for their parts.  But I haven't been able to find anyone
doing this quest!  If there is anyone on Saryrn doing the sonic wolfbane
quest please let me know, either here or in game.
