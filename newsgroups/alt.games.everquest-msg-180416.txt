 A friend of mine has a weird problem with his autojoined chat channel that
we all share. When he first logs in he isn't joined but when he zones he
joins the channel. What's most frustrating is that it seems to drop and
rejoin when zoning again, so when he travels he's only in chat every other
zone. It's more than our private chat channel too, happens with our
server's 'auction' channel as well.

 Anyone else seen this behavior? We've tried a couple things but this has
basically not changed since they added the channels, or the first patch
thereafter.
