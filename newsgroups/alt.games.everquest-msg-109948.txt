We're also 99.999999% sure that the AA skills are also fake. 41 points
at L55 is about as likely as the equipment. So, now we have the
advertised equipment and AA skills being fake, we're left with 'taking
his word' that there's a character at all.

Take a look at the auction:
During my time in everquest I was among the "uber" guilds, hence how I
got all my gear. You'll be a welcome addition to any guild, slaughter
anything you wish, and blow people away with your ability to solo. Want
something in KC? Go solo it. Right warriors can't solo...until now. I've
been doing AA points for the past month or so and have racked up quite a
few. 

Hell, I could be wrong. He could be a L55 warrior who got the pick of
items from a L60 uberguild who secretly killed Lord Seru without anyone
knowing. He could've soloed for a month with his non-top-end weapons and
gotten 41 x L51 in a month at L55, without deciding to get the MUCH
bigger improvements from levelling to L60. He could've chosen to put AA
points into metabolism, first aid, and lung capacity rather than
durability. He could've just made up the equipment and AA levels in the
hopes that someone would hand over $300 without actually inspecting his
character.

On the other hand, the CHARACTER might be fake, and you fell for a
troll...

Mr Occum needs a shave, methinks...
