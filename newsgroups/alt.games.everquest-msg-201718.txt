Ours was a high tension group.  It started from one guy always trying to hog
the loot.  He had gotten real lucky early on finding an overpowered hammer
and ever after that he got grabby with the loot piles.  If we questioned his
taking what had not been agreed to he would respond with something like: "Do
you really want to try to take this back from me"?  The 2 of us couldn't
physically take him on, but eventually I managed to incite him to attack a
dragon he had no chance against.  He was buried not ressed.
