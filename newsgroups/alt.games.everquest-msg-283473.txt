Well ok but it seems like making it easier to raid the Kael Arena or
something.  At this point who is going to bother?  And the way they
made it easier seems even more out of whack, considering they just
allowed you to bring more people in to the instance (and allowed you to
add them after you start).  Now that loot is old and anyone who can put
together a 50-person raid isn't going to bother with LDON.  I could be
wrong of course but it seems to me that at the very least, if you
wanted to encourage LDON raiding you would either make it more
rewarding (attracting raiding guilds) or make it easier for smaller
groups, since the only guilds that would benefit don't have quite so
many level 65 or 70 players available to raid.
