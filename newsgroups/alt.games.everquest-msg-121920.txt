Seems to miss people that the idea of creating a virtual fantasy world gets
kind of ruined when that SK infront of you has a name that reads Sacrifice
Your Soul or the Bard is called Did you spill my pint.

What I'd like is for an extended/unlimited /filter for names where I can add
/filtername Sakruhfice and I'll never see the name instead it'll just show
Class or Race and Guild. I'd never bother another GM with a time wasting
Name pertition again and I'll never have to see them (or deal with them)
again, maybe an idea for EQ2.
