I think one of the things we forgot to discuss was internet connection.
I've got a AMD 1900+, GeForce 3, 512 DDRAM, and yup, I lag, but thats
because i'm playing on a 56k modem.. none of mine nice equipment is gonna
make up for the bad connection =0(.

PS - Hopefully I'll have cable in the next couple of weeks, but I live out
in the middle of the woods, so except for my bitching they weren't really
planning on putting it out here.. when I moved in I had to wait a month and
a half for them to get me one phone line let alone the 3 I have.
