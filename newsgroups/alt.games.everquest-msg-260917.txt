I haven't bought OoW yet... and the task system is the main draw at this 
point. theres enough content I havent done that I'm not itching for more 
yet... but the tasks sounded like a nice way to mix things up with my 
many alts.

Today, I was hanging out in MM camping the pages for greenmist with my 
sk alt when a 32nd level BL zoned in; we got to talking; and it turned 
out he had been tasked to kill 10 deathly ushers, and collect 4 
moonlight essences.

That's not even sensible. Deathly ushers are fairly common, but are 
located around mobs that, among other things are variously: higher 
level, nuke for 250, root, are highly social, run at low health, are a 
long way from a zone line with dozens of mobs between you and it... 

No solo BL is ever going to take 10 of them in any reasonable time 
frame.

The task itself I think could be a fun diversion for a group, but its 
nuts to suggest its a solo system. Too bad only one person in the group 
will derive any benefit from the new system... killing it for groups. 
(Unless theres more and groups can -jointly- do them???)

That's just one example... but it follows what else I've been hearing. 
Nuts... I was kind of looking forward to OoW
