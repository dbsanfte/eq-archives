Why even bother doing anything like that? It would accomplish nothing
to offset any increase in AC cap by decreasing its effectiveness. May
as well leave it alone. I thought the suggestion was just to increase
the AC cap.

That's what I meant - would do more to close off a group to other
classes. The theory of the "holy trinity" would be further reinforced.

That's a good point. They did mention that they would like to get away
from the "sic the warrior on the mob and start healing like crazy"
strategy though. I think it would be a good thing if they could
accomplish this without ruining other aspects.

Well, I wouldn't say they should be as good at it as wizards, but less
effective doesn't mean ineffective. I can't imagine anyone wanting to
play a class when all they are wanted for is mod rodding. That's yet
another level removed from the actual fight. The tank beats on the
actual mob - the clerics heal the tank - the mage hands out rods to
the clerics - "is the mob dead yet? Anyone? I can't see what's going
on...!" Boring.

I think that only applies to those who can't enjoy grouping unless
they do so in what they feel to be the most efficient combination
possible.
