I don't think I even knew rogues could "steal" on my monk, until I was like
55+

Of course my monk didn't loot shit for god knows how many levels anyway (at
least 40).. it was a catch-22.  My gear was pathetic, so it weighed a lot.
Because it weighed a lot, I couldn't hold any loot /sigh    So I went a lot
of levels with no gear, and maybe 1kpp in the bank.

Of course ince I got 60 and above, my weight is about 15 under my limit, and
I have a 75% coin weight reduction.

> Something along the lines of "Stop! Thief! <Eiri>"

Wee!  I don't group with random rogues anyway... but all mobs should do
that.  Stop stealing poor noobs money.

I've tried PPing red mobs (city guards) with a skill of 0, never got that
message though!

SH is mapped to my arrows keys, thats always capped.  Hmm, maybe I should
replace that with Sense/Disarm trap, the skill is seriously lagging behind
(Disarm trap is at (5)).. trouble is, its page 2 of my hotkeys (aka
non-everyday use, so I never press em.

Lock pick..  bleh I haven't even looked at that.  What I forsee myself
needing -
Max lockpick, Max Sense trap, Max Disarm trap.
Whatever PP skill for epic.
Max BS (Hmm anybody know if chaotic gives skill raises?  The amt im
tanking.. BSing from the front would be great for skill-raises)

Want it nerfed?

Wish I knew why I could buff a green to me pet, but the same buffs are "too
powerful" for me.
I WANT avater damnit!

1hp and 1hs are most likely maxed
1hb is zero
Archery is 60-odd
Throwing is 4 (I worked on it last night *g*)
BS is 160? (Forgot what I said)

Pet raises defence skills?  I didn't think it helped any combat-only skills?
Thats why bots and pling rocks tho... its one thing im surely streets ahead
of every other rogue for

Nah not really.  Pretty much every other mob, I get agro within a second or
2 of pressing attack on mobs like that (possible tripple attack for over
100/hit, fly kick (possible 3 special attack combo w/Wus), maybe a proc
(could be 2, i duel wield proc weapons) for 150 each (maybe 200 if i crit
nuke).. of course thats if it didn't kill the mob before he could even look
at me :p

Remember these are 30-40 mobs

You want your defence up?  Stop evading :)
