ooooooorrrr, it's people playing out a fantasy in a fantasy game,
having fun with it they way they choose to have fun. Even if they're
not full-out RPing... It's a game. Some people think it's fun to play
out the fantasy. Might as well dump on people for letting their
characters in The Sims get married. *shrug*
