I realised after that grouping with my druid actually just slows the druid
down, so I'm probably best off selling his gear and twinking something that
would complement the druid. Would a warrior be a better prospect? I realise
monks are probably off in large groups, where another tank can take aggro,
but I only have two accounts and people often don't know how to group with a
2 boxer (i.e. don't pull the fight away from the healer, you will die,
because follow doesn not work reliably ... I've had my druid going in orbit
or heading into infinity on a tangent!)

Alternatively I could replace the druid with a warrior to draw aggro, and
just hope i can always find other people who will heal, port, and buff me. I
have a guild, but they are too low level to group with, (I was trying to
find a guild for months, but most are for 60+ or 30- level guys) and I like
the guys enough to be willing to go it alone till they catch up a bit.

Or I could just focus on getting a xp machine druid up to 60+ so that I can
join an uberguild and get the monks epic, but it's so dull compared to the
pre-nerf monk I started this game with. I grouped with a 60 monk pre-nerf
for a while in permafrost who had really great no-drop gear, and we fought
dark blues (to a lv 49 druid) with some success. Maybe I should just bite
the bullet and accept that a high level monk is only playable in an
uberguild that raids a lot and is willing to develop their gear. There's not
a heck of a lot better gear I can buy before paying 10K+ per item. That
takes about a month. Is that what everyone else does?

I tried killing hg's but the number of loot-stealing rogues was just
ridiculous.
