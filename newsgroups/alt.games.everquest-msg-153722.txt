Manaburn was (and still will be) the best option against something that
needs to die NOW...

The only mob I've seen it be truly useful on is Sontalak.   He has
moderately low HP, and outputs enough melee / AE damage to rip a good sized
raid of level 60 to shreds, if he lives more than a minute or two.   For the
other hard encounters, it was only useful due to the "nearly limitless
supply of mana" that constant Mod rod 2's gave.   You could throw it out for
an early zero aggro boost of damage, then by the time you were modded back
to nuking level of mana, the tank would have enough aggro that you could
nuke normally.

Other than Sont, it was only "useful" in the sense that it allowed a
ridiculously small group of people to kill something.  Even without
manaburning Kunark dragons, they're just not hard enough to be a challenge
to a decent sized or high leveled raid force.

There aren't any such mobs in the game.  (yet)

About the only thing that will "increase" their damage output near death is
enrage, which only lasts for 10 seconds.
