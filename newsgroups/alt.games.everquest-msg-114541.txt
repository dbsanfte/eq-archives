Leveling up isn't much of an accomplishment, and certainly nothing to
trigger a celebratory mood among strangers. There's nothing different
about the kill that made the ding sound than the kill immediately
prior to it.

There's nothing self-absorbed or cynical about not caring if someone
just made level 3, or 12, or 40. It's not like gaining a level is a
rare event, or even a surpassingly difficult one.
