Nope.  Where do you get the idea that I "get in their face"?  And do
you really believe that a single-line of polite chat text directed to
a specific person is "the pushiest manner possible"?

Not interested in arguing about your strawmen DT, please stick to the
subject at hand.

You're stretching beyond the bounds of ordinary logic here.  The two
are not reasonably comparable no matter how much you care to thrash
and twist about.

um, no.  It's your opinion on whether <you> feel that I'm rude.  By
your insistence you cannot define that behavior as rude from another
person's perspective.

No it is not.  The closest analogy in "RL" would be the difference
between a shout and a quiet aside.  Most people in RL would find the
shouter extremely rude, quite the reverse of your contention.

Another strawman.  This time you try to put words in my mouth.
Starting to feel just how hopeless your position is, eh?
