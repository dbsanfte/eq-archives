Yes.  Why even have sense heading as a skill then?  I also thing they should
give everyone 200 in bind wound right off the bat too.  Matter of fact *every*
skill that every race / class has should be automattically at 200.  Takes the
tedium out of the game.
They don't care about the carpal tunnel syndrome of 4000 arrow combines but
sense heading has got to be fixed???
Bah!
