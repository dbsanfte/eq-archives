I applaud that last statement. I am lvl 24 now but at lvl 29 and 34 i will
charge for ports. not outrageously like some on Zeb but a minimum fee. My
thoguths behid this are that I am more than likely in a group or getting
into one at that moment. If some sends me a tell directly and asks for a
port he/she/it will have to pay. The only exceptions being a CR. How can
someone pay you when their corpse isnt even on the same continent? lol If i
am being the port monkey of the day I am there for a reason. More than
likely I am porting around because i either need money for spells, armor, or
whatever. I am think 5pp a seat wouldnt be too bad. Thats 25pp for a trip.
Now in the case of dangerous Zones this fee will go up, and i think that
that is fair. Of course in the more dangerous zones you will have higher
level characters any way and if they are going to Velious, and are over lvl
45 they should have a bit of money anyway. along with that charge will be a
Lev if you want it and anything else i might be able to provide. I have
people now who want to pay me for Invis. That one's free. its only a
miniscule amount of mana after all. There's my 2cp worth. Get the flame
throwers out.
