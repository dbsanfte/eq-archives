Ha...got one better... my Pally on EMarr, the very second he spawned as a
new character... before he had half a chance to even think of destroying his
Tome of Discord, equiping his candle, or reading his Newbie Note, got hit up
for money by a beggar.

Took a while for me to convince the beggar that I, as a brand new lowbie
that just spawned for the first time two seconds prior to meeting him, did
not have any money to give him at all.

The beggar walked off in a huff when I told him that he should be giving to
me, since I was lower level than him.
