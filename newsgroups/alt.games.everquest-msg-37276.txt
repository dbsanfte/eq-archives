I'll be as nice as possible with an asshole such as yourself.  I spent my entire
EQ day yesterday proving my point, and I wasted prime hunting in ToV.  I don't
plan on wasting any more time to please the likes of you.  You say I'm full of
shit?   That's an opinion, and like I said, yours just doesn't matter, so kiss
off, and good day pussycat.
