I've seen smaller guilds get bad raps simply for having the audacity to
stand up to the bigger guilds (I use audacity here as in how the bigger
guilds look down upon the smaller guilds).

For example, no matter what we did, we were always wrong.  Ragefire camp
being the best example of this.  We sit there for a full week, no pop.  When
he finally pops a bigger guild rushes in, trains us so we're busy for a sec,
then engages the dragon.  We bitch saying we've been here for a week and
were here first, they say "Camps don't exist".  We bitch about it on our
server board, everyone agrees that "Camps don't exist" and we get blasted
for being "newbs".

Next week.  We don't bother camping him.  We hear he's due, we pour in and
wait to be the first to engage.  The guild that was there bitches, we say
"Camps don't exist"... all of the higher level guilds that did this same
thing to us spring to the "camping" guilds defense.  The server board blasts
us AGAIN for doing the wrong thing, even though it was exactly what those
hypocrites wanted us to do and said was the proper way to do it.

Next week.  We camp him again.  A very very high level guild on the server
has one person, a single cleric that logs in a few hours before he's due.
Few minutes before hand, 2 manaburning wizard guildies of his log in next to
him.  Rage pops, we engage, we kill human form with no interferance, dragon
form pops, they nuke and KS it, their cleric loots.  We are blasted on the
boards for not having the sufficient damage to out KS them.

Later, after this guild dispanded... I became a part of another guild.  Very
big guild.  What did we do?  I remember one particular instance where there
was a guild prepping outside the entry to Fear and in the proccess of zoning
groups in.  We all ran in the portal, right infront of them, and commenced
to kill everything in the zone to get at the epic mobs inside.  Would that
guild have bitched had we been their size or smaller.  Hell yes.  Did these
guys bitch at us because we were a bigger guild than they?  Nope.  In fact
they THANKED us for trying to leave a few mobs up (even though we didn't
leave jack).  That discusted me.  I couldn't stand the hypocricy any longer.
I quit that guild.  No idea what I'm going to do now.  Can't stand getting
stepped on in small guilds on my server, can't stand being a hypocrite by
being a part of the big guilds on my server.  My server is just fucked plain
and simple.  Too much competition, everyone is cut throat.

The bottom line is, if you're in a big guild, you're right.  No matter what.
No matter what you do, no matter how underhanded, as long as it was done to
a smaller guild.  If you're in a smaller guild, you are wrong, no matter
what.
