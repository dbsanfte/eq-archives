But that is EXACTLY what the bazaar is good for...  instead of searching for
one particular item by name, you search for items that match a certain
criteria.  For example, you could search for Dark Elf, Necromancer, chest
slot, INT items with a focus effect.  Or you could search for something
broader, maybe necromancer usable foot slot items with +mana.  I think the
reason people haven't been recommending many specific items is because it's
hard to say just how cheap lower to mid-level gear has gotten since the
bazaar went live.
