Hrrm... <grin>  Starting with a semi-clean slate here. ;p


In a -file- there are -records-, think of the physical -file- as a filing
cabinet and then from there the many records in it.  When you open one of
those records in the filing cabinet they have nothing more than a piece of
paper in it with -fields-.    Such as "customer name", "customer phone
number," etc.

With that said.  In the world of programming there are proper names for such
fields which determines what can be placed into them (ie. data type).

STR, STA, DEX, etc   are all stored as a field type of "Byte."   A "Byte"
field type can ONLY store any integer number (ie. without ANY decimal point)
between the numbers of 0 and 255.

So you see, whenever they load the value of your WIS, CHA, INT, etc it can
only be from 0 to 255 (on the positive scale ONLY and without ANY decimal
points) of integer value.

They do this simply because a Byte is faster (when adding to, subtracting,
accessing, etc) than say, an "integer" type, which CAN store negative
numbers, but, also can store from -65536 to +65536, because of this
procedures/functions on such numbers are "slower."

So, in order to keep math quick (ie. keeping WIS, CHA, STA, etc stored as a
Byte) they would need to add a Boolean field within the programming to
decide whether or not CHA is beneficial or not, or whatever.
