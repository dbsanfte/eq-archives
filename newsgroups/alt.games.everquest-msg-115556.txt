 Even factoring in a DS I'm fairly certain I will outdamage a Ranger in
toe-to-toe combat. Toe-to-toe combat being what we're talking about here
if you're going to bring damage shields into the discussion. A damage
shield doesn't help you when you're kiting around mobs shooting arrows
at them.

 It is ancedotal and doesn't prove anything. That's one fight. That
Ranger now needs to heal himself and then med back those heals, another
damage shield and two Calefactions whereas the Monk hits mend, throws on
a couple bandages and pulls the next mob. Not to mention all mobs aren't
created equal so the monk may have gotten a spider a level or two higher
with more HPs. Unless you parse it you don't know that you did more
damage. You just know that you killed a mob 7 seconds before they did.
