I'm not talking about "where did that one go" I'm talking about "which 
of the seven bodies here have I not looted?  Remember, much of the time 
when something dies I'm not anywhere nearby to see it fall, and they 
tend to fall in the same general area even though I'm not using guard, 
because I pull new mobs up to the already fighting pet.  If I don't 
clear the bodies out then it might take me several run up and click 
actions just to get the cash off the one that just fell.

I do think that turning confirmation off on destroy, for the sake of 
this kind of camp, would be a good idea, though, it alone eats 
substantial time when I'm destroying an average of two items per body.

But now your mule has to get to the oggok book, zone to feerrot, survive 
the run thru there to the RM zone and then hoof it back to the 
hilltop... instead of just hitting a lizardman with his hammer till it 
gets him to OT, waddling over to the bank (with SOW on you can always 
move regardless of encumberance) and then gating back to position, no 
risk, and much shorter time.  Or so it would seem to me.

More than that, sometimes 5 are dead before I even get around to looting 
them, I never let anything go for 7 minutes... I'm just trying to 
imagine the pile I'd get if I never cleared any of the bodies of their junk.

One HG yes... but 3 at once?  MSII pet with the same DS has a lot more 
HP and hits a little bit harder for the same mana cost to summon, plus 
is a much better deal in terms of canni, which admittedly doesn't matter 
much if you aren't doing canni.

I did hang onto my torch, though, in case baby fire pet ends up making 
more sense.  I think if I'm soloing HG or something like that he 
probably does, I know he was a much better solution for geonids for 
example, in part because of his emminant disposability.
