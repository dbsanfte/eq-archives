Mainly because the suggestions being offered by the vocal ones are
completely unbalancing.  People like hughes aren't talking about fine
tuning, they're talking about making druids as efficient in groups as they
are in soloing.  And they're doing so in the most shameless, bold face
manner possible.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
