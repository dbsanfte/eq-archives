I dunno about the hot spots stuff.  Some folks posting around on the
Emarr boards talking about the better exp not being there.  The thing
is, they're not posting the actual levels of the characters used,
though they said they were doing it solo, how many mobs they killed,
and in what time frame.  But I'll save the actual judgement for when I
go PLing my rogue twink over in Dulak again.
