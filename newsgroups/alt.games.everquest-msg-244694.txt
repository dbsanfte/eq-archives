Guild I am in has set raid nights and start times, and you are expected 
to be there, if you are online.  This does mean that you know what your 
time limits are though.  We take what raid targets we can get, usually 
not too much of an issue, there is a lot out there to choose from at our 
level.  Currently working towards emporer in Ssra, and some PoP targets 
to get elemental and Sol Ro access.
