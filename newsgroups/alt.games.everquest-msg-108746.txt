Yup, it's nice and quiet there. My druid is 6. Group as much as you can, and
be flexible about what kind of group you get into. Definitely all of the
higher end folks all play together and everyone knows you. Reputation means
a lot on Test.

But generally, you can be the only one on the Kunark Express in prime time.

The only time playing on Test is ugly is when all of the other servers are
down.
