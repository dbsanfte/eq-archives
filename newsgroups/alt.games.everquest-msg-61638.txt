The new version of my log parser is now up at http://www.cws.org/~pasketti .

Lots of changes on this one, and I'm sure that SoL will make me have ot
release a newer version...

Joe D

The major changes are:
TOO MANY TABS!  Instead of all the report tabs being accessable from the
  main screen, they are grouped under the new "General", "Damage",
  "Benchmark", or "Pets" tabs on the bottom.  This reduces screen clutter.

Program no longer slows down drastically as it processes more and more
  data.

Now understands "My leader is Soandso." for pet tracking, in addition to
  "my leader is Soandso".

Fixed problem with program bombing if there is garbage in the log. I hope.

Added global merchant data file so that merchant data can be shared between
  characters.  It's a text file, so you can even share data with other
  players by appending their files onto your own.

Program will now generate report even if it doesn't know who you are, ie
  there are no "Soandso saved." lines in the logs.

Added "Sanity Check" option to disable timestamp sequence checking, and
  checking of extra "Soandso saved." lines.

Moved the "Messages" box to one of the report tabs to make better use of
  screen space.

Added "Deaths" report, to tell you how, when, and where you died.

Added "Other Damage Output" and "Other Damage Taken" reports, that list
  the total damage done/taken by other players or mobs, not just yours.

Added "Fishing by Zone" report.

Removed merchant inventory from the "Merchant Items Bought" report, and
  added it to the new "Merchant Inventory" report.

"You have been healed" messages now processed correctly.  Heals are now
  reported in the "Misc" and "Level Stats" reports.

Old faction names without spaces in them now added in with their new
  equivalents that have spaces in them.

Added option to ignore old-style spoofable loot messages.  Default is
  to ignore them.

Another silly sig.
