Of course they should be obligated to ! Both carrots and sticks and
incidently picking up fallen people are funded with money stolen at gunpoint
so all of it should stop unless charity funded. But even so the problem is
cheapest to handle with treatment. The numbers are in and they show that
reducing drug users is done cheapest by treatment by a HUGE percentage.
Leaving aside the freedom issue, which is actually the most important to me,
if your gonna steal my money to reduce drug use dont waste 90% doing it the
wrong way damnit.
