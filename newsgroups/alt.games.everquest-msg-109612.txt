}OK, I see what you and DT are saying.  My point, and I believe that kaev is
}making this point as well, is that there is a good and evil outside what we
}believe.  In other words, we can be doing things we think are good, and
}still be doing evil.  Someone else can be doing something that we think is
}evil, but is actually good.  It goes along with the idea of subjective
}realities and perception.

In this case, what we believe about good and evil can be equated with how 
we perceive good and evil.  Err... well, I can't figure out how to put 
that better.  But the point is, if there -is- an absolute good and evil, 
outside of what we individually perceive and believe to be good or evil, 
we will have absolutely no way of seeing it.

It's like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, with which I'm sure you're 
all familiar.  The basic idea is, if you're trying to measure exactly 
where something is and how fast it is going, there is a lower limit to the 
product of the accuracies of the measurements.  The reason for this is, 
the very act of measuring the position and momentum of the object is 
sufficient to change the position and momentum of the object.

In the same way, if we try to determine whether some action, belief, 
whatever is good or evil, there is no way to do so without relying, at 
some point, on someone's perceptions, and the resulting determination is 
inherently colored by those perceptions.

It doesn't do much good having a Complete and Accurate Real Division 
Between Good and Evil, if there's no way you can completely and accurately 
determine what it actually -is- without subjectively coloring it.  So it 
really doesn't matter whether there is such a beastie or not.

I'm just glad my own personal "whispers of Good" seem to give me a fairly 
accurate guide.  It will never agree with -everyone- else's though.
