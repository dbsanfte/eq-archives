Well I got sick of casting imaginary spells on the supermarket 
auto-doors so I signed back up.

Noticed that of a friends list of over 100 on my server, nobody was ever 
on. Guild was dead. Only ever saw one other person from my guild - a 
bazaar mule I didn't recognise.

Movelogged to another server and applied to an EP guild there who 
actually raid in my time zone - 3 times a week!

They accepted me as a 'casual' member as my flags suck (previous guild 
rarely managed more than 30 people in a raid and didn't get that far 
into EP progression) and I've been on every raid since, bar tonight.

I'm not bored or tired of it yet, which is good cos it hasn't been going 
that long. I've enjoyed seeing new content and they seem like a nice 
bunch of people but the flavour of my old guild seems missing - and I 
miss it.

I also miss the friends I used to have, but I've made some new ones and 
will make more.

Cheers,
