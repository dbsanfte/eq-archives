I use macros mainly to keep things in character

For Rosewhite, a halfling druid

You look a little peaked, %t.
/cast 8 (best heal)
/pause 80
That should fix you right as rain.

Thing won't hurt as much if you have a thick skin.
/cast 7 (best skin)
/pause 70
That should be of some help, %t.

/em sighs tiredly and pulls a wolf's tail from her pack.
/em repeatedly smacks %t about the face with the tail.
/cast 5 (spirit of wolf)
/pause 70
(this for when I give in to people begging for sows. When asked, I say that
all of this ritual is just for my amusement.)

/kneel say makes a polite curtsey before %t.

/em kicks %t in the shins.
/em mutters, 'You old meanie.'

/em pats %t on the hand. 'Aren't you the dear thing.'

For Graham, human cleric

In the name of Rodcet Nife, be HEALED!
/cast 8 (best heal)

The gods grant you courage, %t.
/cast 6 (courage)

/em calls down divine wrath upon %t!
/cast 1 (best evocation)

/em shakes his head sadly.
Oh, ye of little faith.
(used when a spell fizzles on a PC target)

My warrior uses a macro to tell others that a critter is getting taunted. I
change this pretty often; variations have included...

/em mocks %t's sense of fashion.
/em makes rude remarks about %t's mother.
/em points out the flaws in %t's philosophy.
/em says to %t, 'That's what you get, voting for Nader.'
