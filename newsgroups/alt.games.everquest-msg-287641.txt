I don't know, as I have only taken one of my characters up from
45 to 50 in the past 12 days. The rest of my characters are below
40th. The hot zones have an extra 25 percent exp until July 25. I
have noticed more players in the game recently.

Hmm... I got a brand new character to 30th in the past 32 weeks.

You might check the official forums, lots of returning players
with old armor and stats, and they are benefiting from the
defiant random armor drops. Lower Guk is supposed to be an
instance and a LIving Legacy area until the end of the promo.
