Hehehe... just so ya know, my own stories started on the now-defunct
drinal.net, where I started posting stories about my adventures in my 20's.
That was when I thought anyone above 50 was a god and Sleeper's Tomb was a
mystical paradise I'd never see.  =)

Interestingly enough, my first "raid" with Knights of the Wolfpack took us
to Mistmoore.  This is where we learned not to let badly-injured mobs go
wandering away.  =)

My biggest weaknesses are - dashes and; semi-colons.  In fact, whenever I do
any creative writing, I usually have to go back and eliminate about a
hundred semi-colons.  =)

lolol

He definitely needs to learn the things you mentioned.  I wouldn't
necessarily remove him from the guild for a first offense, but I *would* let
him know that raids are never, ever about getting XP.  They are for loot or
flags or something that accomplishes a goal that the guild set.  In this
instance, your guild was learning *how* to raid, which is quite admirable.
If you can get "the kid" to understand that that was the goal, he may be
more receptive in the future.  If not, he'll leave the guild, join another,
and find that their raids are exactly like yours, and maybe *then* the
message will get through.  =)

Pulling huge green trains can be quite fun.  =)  I had a blast teaming up
with a wizzie to AE nuke green mobs in Hollowshade Moor so I could farm some
smithing components.

That sounds like a fun moment.  =)  Some of the best experiences in EQ are
the ones that end with, "I can't believe we lived through that."

That's a problem even with "uber" guilds.  If y'all can get that down early,
you'll be way ahead of the curve.  =)

Thanks for the journal, James, was fun to read.
