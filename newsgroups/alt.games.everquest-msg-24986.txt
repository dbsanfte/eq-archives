My initial attempts in that direction have been, ... errr...
disappointing to say the least. :-(

We have a couple of good guild alliances already, particularly with
Tiru's guild. Problem is, they are also IMHO, "farm team" guilds. They
have the uber-flight problem as well.  I have no clue how I shall help
form such alliances, as I can't even get into old Seb yet. Perhaps a
certain 53 warrior of our mutual acquaintance will help us with that.

You know you are always welcome, either to rejoin or to group with Tiru
and I and/or any of the other handful of 40+ members we have.

I really have no idea. I don't want to leave at all. That's why I posted
this question here. Tiru and I have discussed it at length. If I can
find a way to hold things together, then that's what I'll do. If our
guild can't get me into Sleeper's Tomb by Christmas, then I may, in
fact, be moving on. Sad, but true.

Yes. We want to keep alts of uber-flight folks in the guild where
possible. It's one possible bridge to forming alliances with established
uberguilds and maybe getting us the training and experience we need to
grow. But our early experiences with some of the established uberguilds
on Xev is that they have a *very* exclusive, non-sharing attitude and
don't want your alts hanging around with "trash guilds".

You'll do fine. Hang in there.
