AO is an interesting case. Here was a game that was more fun in beta than it 
was in release, and most fun in Beta3 -- they screwed lots of things up in 
Beta4. Then of course was the tragic launch that seemed to be affecting most 
everyone except me. I think the reason that I was spared much of the grief 
was because I managed to get far enough away from cities and missions to 
avoid many of the big problems. The two characters I two-boxed (dual 
Traders) hadn't yet been nerfed, so using wrangles and drains I was able to 
cascade my skills up to the point of being able to use ridiculous weapons, 
so I was soloing reds and oranges out in the woods. I died a few times when 
things went south, but the challenge of being able to sustain that 
ransack/deprive chain was fun and got me leveled up pretty fast. I hear that 
Funcom has made a pretty decent game out it since, but I've resisted all 
efforts to lure me back.

How did they wind up handling the spawn camping? Did they stop putting spawn 
points in pvp areas? Talk about noob mmog pvp mistakes ...
