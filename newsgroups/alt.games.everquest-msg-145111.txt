60 enchanters have it worse, there's a LOT less of them than 29+ druids or
even 49+ clerics (56+ or epiced even if you want to be picky), which means
that the few that choose to be non-anon have the burden of so many morons
spread thick on a small number of them.

I've spent maybe 1 or 2 of my 61 /played days under anon or role as a 56
druid, and it's really not that bad in my experience, only in the kunark
grind zones (especially LoIO since I was frequently the only port-capable
druid there before everyone moved to Paludal) did I really have to go
anon/role, and a few newbie zones (gfay and misty thicket mostly)

That said, I specifically DONT run around harassing enchanters for KEI, I
refuse to pay for it, and I hunt just fine without it, I do jump at porting
someone who's trading KEI though, but that doesn't happen a lot, and if I
get ninjabuffed with it I just thank them and am happy at my luck.  It's a
nice spell for sure, but I refuse to become an addict to it.
