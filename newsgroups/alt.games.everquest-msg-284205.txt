The fact that it takes time to hit the target makes arrows perfect for
pulling cast-happy mobs.  You can fire the arrow and then get out of
line of sight before the mob agros, preventing it from casting.

Not anymore, there is a command now for archery called /autofire which
will treat ranged attacks almost exactly like melee attacks.  The main
difference is that autofire will not turn off if you sit or kneel and
it isnt always clear that autofire is on.  (It will, however, turn off
if a targeted NPC dies) You must be careful with it, because you won't
always know it is on when you click on an NPC, which can obviously
cause problems.

Note that fletching is very easy right until you hit 202 and then
suddenly you have to farm.  The best option for most is shadow tipped
acrylia, if you care.  Farming for this is best in Acrylia Caverns and
Shadeweaver's Thicket (condensed shadow).

I used to kill the Nexus Scions with my bow.  They don't summon and are
rooted.  They resist most or all spells though and hit in the thousands
so at least at one point in the game's evolution, Rangers were the only
class who could even consider soloing them and probably the only real
option for killing them at all.  I don't know if you can attack any of
them anymore.  Last time I tried, I was able to shoot the GD Scion but
not the GFay Scoin
