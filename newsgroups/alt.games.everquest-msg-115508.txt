I think it is because the original vision had in mind for cities to be
places where people would meet up to find groups.  Didn't work out that way
on the other servers, so they're trying it on FV.

To really make it work, they'd probably have to dismantle or re-work the
entire druid/wizard porting system.  They put the porting locales too far
away from cities, making places like Qeynos into ghost towns instead of
gathering & meeting places.

Real life commerce would cause cities to sprout up in the
trade/transportation centers, like the stone bridge & spires in NKarana
(especially since the opening of Luclin) and the tunnel in EC (all the
trading, plus druid ring in same zone, wiz pyramid in NRo, any banker would
be an idiot for not setting up shop there....).
