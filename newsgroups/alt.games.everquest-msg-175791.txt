Heh,

Wait til you get to the mid to high level camps.  Especially the popular
ones.  Wait til you camp the Ancient cyclops for days and weeks on end til
your eyes get red, only to see him pop and fall in seconds to a 55 plus
Druid.  Then tell me how nice people are.

For now, Because of the game structure and each zone being based on Levels.
The lowby zones you are hitting is not as crowded.  And I guarantee the
majority of the lowbies you group with at them zones have higher level alts.
They tend to be friendly cause they don't need lowby loot as before when
everyone started on a fresh server competing for the same spawn and camps.
At lowbies, majority of the noobs you hunt with will have alts.  So they
don't really care about loot when you are say, crushing orcs or derves in
West commons. But once you start hitting the mid to high level popular zones
don't be surprised when you start butting heads over camps or someone
decides to KS that named mob you were camping for hours on end.

Not saying everyone at EQ is like that, but to think people are nice in EQ
over UO over one incident.. well you got lots to learn, but do enjoy the
Everquest experience.
