That's quite a contrast to the child-mother "team" Ryou was complaining
about in the channel last night, heh.  It's a shame that so few parents
seem to both take an active interest in their child's on-line activity
and be ready and willing to intervene when it's the child who's getting
out of hand.  It's oh so easy to jump in and defend little Johnny, and
often that's what's called for, but way too many people seem unable to
understand that sometimes it's little Johnny who's the one in need of
correction.
