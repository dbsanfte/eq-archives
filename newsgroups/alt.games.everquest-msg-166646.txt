There is a high level troll warrior on E'ci, in what was, at least at the
end of Velious, uber gear, that has been sold on E'bay a minimum of 4 times,
that we know of...   Not much of a secret that pretty much every time you
see him wearing a new guild tag.... well, you know what happened.

Pity too.  I'm told that the original owner (or was it the second?)  was
actually a pretty nice guy.
