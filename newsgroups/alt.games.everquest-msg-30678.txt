    Yes, it is. ;-)

    Note that this is a pretty slow way to PL usually, as the cleric's
damage output is almost entirely mana-based.

    Gotta watch this. If the twink doesn't do damage before the damage
shield kills the mob, mob goes poof and no XP. Usually not a problem with a
mob that runs, but can be an issue.

>Does this work ?

    Very well. Last night, my 40 rogue helped a friend's enchanter get
through the most painful level in all enchanterdom - 15. I'd beat a random
croc within an inch of death (until it would no longer come back when I sat
down), she would cast her Mem Blur, then nuke it/poke it with her Walrus
Tooth for the kill. She seemed to be getting roughly a blue every two
minutes, as the red Deepwater Crocs I brought her each gave a blue.

>Is this an offence ?

    Nope. Once did the cleric version with a friend in Everfrost - there was
some combination of cleric nukes and stuns that would drop a momma mammoth
to ALMOST dead, then I'd Atone until the /con changed and let her work her
Backstab up. ;-)
