Actually I think they're getting apathy from both ends.

The "casual players" are seeing that it is an expansion aimed almost
completely at the level 60 crowd, which seems so far away from them.   Keyed
zones that must be "defeated" in order... so you'll have to be in an uber
raiding guild to actually see most of the place.  (I know this may not be
the case, but it's the impression that I have at the moment, so I'm assuming
at least some others have it.)


The "hardcore raiders", the ones that this expainsion seems aimed at, are
upset about feeling that they will have to take time off what they currently
enjoy, (raiding) and return to leveling for 5 more super long levels,(even
if Sony claims they won't be super long, we've all heard that before.) if
they want to remain on top of thier game.
