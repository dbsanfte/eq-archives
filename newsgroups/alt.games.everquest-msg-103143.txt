Dunno, I don't feel like doing a websearch (don't know how to find these
types of stories, actually).  But who said they're doing it to defend the
Constitution?  I imagine most of the nut-job SA NRA types do it 'cause
Charlton Heston spoke to them in their dreams or they're seriously pissed
that someone wants to take away the guns that God gave them the Right to
own.

I'm going to assume that, like me, you don't really have anything to back
that up.  But let's say it's true...it's just like the pro-lifers KILLING
people because they want to have or perform an abortion.  In both cases the
killers are ungodly stupid.

Here is the Second Amendment verbatim:

"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."

Sounds to me like they were talking about a well regulated Militia.  Since
that doesn't exist (though is constitutionally allowed and encouraged) the
rest of the sentence is pretty meaningless.  Actually, since I'm PRETTY sure
that sentence makes no grammatical sense at all that's yet another reason to
toss it out the window and try again.

Well, maybe it makes sense...lemme re-write it for clarity:

A well regulated Militia shall not be infringed.  It is necessary for the
security of a free State that the people have the right to keep and bear
Arms in that Militia.

Ok, I'm no Shakespeare either.
