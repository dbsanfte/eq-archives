I hope you mean 2 yellow in 2 hours, cos if you consider 2 blue in 2 hours good
exp for a L30 Druid, I must be doing something wrong...or right.

The mammoths are seriously overcamped, mostly by other druids from 24-30,
however. At least, they are on Karana. I'd suggest avoiding the area, unless you
play at an hour when there are not many people on the server, because the trip
is not worth making, if when you get there you find about 10 people already
there overcontrolling the mammoth population.
