But, I also feel that people shouldn't take baseball or chess seriously
either. Yes, it's fine to put a lot of effort into learning to play well;
but when you think about how stressed out some people get trying to be the
best, then I think it's going to far.

My brother gets very stressed out when he playes EQ. He swears at the PC
whenever he dies. I think if the game is putting you into rage, you should
take a break and do something else for a while.
