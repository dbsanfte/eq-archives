The warnings didn't help people who zoned in AFTER you started your
train. You also left the newbies vulnerable who used the guards for
protection...

Quite appropriate, really. Best to solve problems quietly and quickly.

Two words: Guild reputation. So long as you wear a guild tag, you
represent your guild. You look bad, your guild looks bad.

>Oh, did I mention the guild was an evil one?
>I mean - I am a DEF necro!

Oh, have we mentioned a million times in the past that being an evil
race/class IC is *NO* excuse to train, killsteal, scam, whatnot - In
other words, greif playing? Bullshit like that is what gives the real
roleplayers a bad reputation.

Yes. Sorry, trains aren't "funny". They're a hazard. Frankly, I think
that not only should you have been booted from the guild, but a
/report of your guildchat bragging about the train sent in and
petitioned.
