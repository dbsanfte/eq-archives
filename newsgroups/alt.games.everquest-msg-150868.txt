Same here. Everything seems almost exactly the same. I can tell they were
changed, but not significantly. I still get the same exact color sparklies
and patterns for all the spells I tested. I think one reason people think
the new ones look so weird is because default opacity is 100%, and the old
ones were never fully opaque. I set it to 75% and I barely notice the
difference.

Or maybe mage spells didnt get any radicaly new effects. ::shrug::
