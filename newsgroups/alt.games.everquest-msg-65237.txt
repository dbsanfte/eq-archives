It sounds like IBM had Matrox make them some special purpose cards for these
machines. Computer mfg's will do that, even though the card will say Matrox
it in reality is an IBM proprietary card.
If I were you I'd do as suggested above and get a new case and mobo. If
buying a sound card too is an issue, you can buy a mobo with onboard sound
easily. This seems to be the best and fastest way out of your current
situation.
