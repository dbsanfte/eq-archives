Actually, which part of EULA do you think prohibits this? I just read it and
don't see anything that this violates even in spirit. This is a genuine
question,
I'm not trying to justify anything I just don't see anything that even
mentions this kind of thing at all. It only talks about modifying the
software
which this clearly does not do as it doesn't even run on the same computer.

Unless I missed something.
