Heh, I'm not endgame oriented, haven't been there and may
never reach it.  My 54 Paladin's gear is decent, and I can
tank ok, but a 54 Warrior with equivalent gear (i.e. the
same pp value in Warrior gear) is gonna have significantly
more AC and HP while outdamaging me noticeably.  But I read
a lot of complaints about Warrior viability in the endgame
so the subject catches my attention (a number of the endgame
changes to date have impacted me).

I disagree in part.  It is not a case of "resembling".  My
kit is worth perhaps 40kpp.  A Warrior kitted out for 40k
would be a very noticeably better tank than me.  Only in the
case of Kunark class armor is Warrior stuff more expensive
than Paladin stuff, other class specific gear is generally
much cheaper, especially the 2-handed weapons that give the
best damage output.  Also figuring into this is that a
Warrior can place much less emphasis on MR gear than a
Paladin/SK because they get a (level/2) MR bonus.  So, a
54 Paladin or SK that is comparable in tanking ability to
a 54 Warrior, with equivalent resists, is pretty certainly
a substantial twink.

Now you're talking real endgame chars, or the silliest of
twinks (I have seen lower level guildmates selling off
individual pieces of gear worth nearly as much as my entire
kit, I did not ask what they upgraded to).

Ordinary Monks, who're working their way up, aren't even
close.  But I guess that sorta supports your point in a
left-handed fashion.

I like that idea, a lot.

Alternative:  Have the all/all (or all melee) gear be ok, but not
as good as the best stuff in the game now.  Have something similar
to the Velious armor quests to upgrade it to class specific gear
that <is> specific (i.e. the Warrior gear has a little more AC and
a lot more HP than the Knight gear, which also has mana, Monk
gear would have less AC and HP than either, but have a bonus to
Block skill or something, & etc.).
If the AC softcap is gone there would be a reason for Knights to
go for the upgraded AC gear, even tho it might not have as many
HP as gear in the game now, and you would reopen the Warrior AC/HP
lead.
