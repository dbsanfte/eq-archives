I'm not too sure about that. Having played for over a year on a US server, a
lot of my friends are based in the US and not about to transfer to a UK box.
You have to trade off better ping times for less people that you'll
(initially) know, unless you are in a European guild of course, in which
case most may transfer anyway. I'll probably create a new character on Bayle
without transferring my existing ones.

Having said that, if a lot of Europeans do transfer, I would expect that it
will make Bayle one of the most crowded servers pretty fast :).
