Hey all,
 I got all of the coins for the Temple of Thunder donations quest.
When I tried to return them to Daedet Losaren in South Qeynos, he
returned the box, saying, "I do not need this" but the coins were no
longer in it. I did not receive any XP, scrolls or anything of the
sort. I am thinking of re-doing the quest, something I did wrong?
thanks-  Shnitt, lv5 noobPally, Vaezelle .
