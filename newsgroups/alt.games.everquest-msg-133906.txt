}I gave some examples in a post replying to Lokari.

Next post down, I expect. :)

}Ahh... the Ace of Cups.

Heh, could Rider-Waite have eve foresen Monty Python?  That's a vaguely 
serious question, by the way.

}>Of course, Rider-Waite and Thoth both have a nice weight of History and

}>Rider-Waite that maintained the symbolism nicely but had less 'cartoonish'

}>re-watercolored, basically.
}The colours in the Rider-Waite deck are important.

}meanings that Waite intended.
}This is the main criticism of the Universal deck.

Yeap, it's not a criticism I'd discount.  Maybe it's a personal problem.  
But that bright yellow background in the magician card just makes my eyes 
bleed.  (Ok, yes, slight exaggeration.  But it annoys me a lot. :) ) Which 
is annoying, because in terms of some of what it represents, it's 
definitely one of my favorite cards.

I've noticed that one of the keys to doing good tarot, in some weird 
unmeasurable sense, is being able to be relaxed and focused, and I have a 
lot more trouble being relaxed and focused with Rider-Waite in front of 
me.  There's still about two dozen decks that I'd prefer R-W to, though, 
that's for sure... 

But you're also right in that there's probably anothe dozen or so decks 
that are very nice to look at, but don't seem to have a 'voice'.  The 
Enchanted Tarot deck comes to mind, for some reason.

Symbolism is important, yes.  But I wouldn't discount aesthetics too much 
on its behalf.  After all, you can use the bit of cardstock with the 
picture with the lighter, more pleasing yellow background as a symbol for 
the bright, offensive one.  If one believes that Rider-Waite had some 
divine inspiration that Mary Hanson-Roberts intrisically lacked, you're 
only adding a tiny baby step between yourself and that higher meaning.

And it's possible Lokari might find some other deck we haven't even 
mentioned even more aesthetically accessible.  She mentioned two of the 
better ones, in my eyes.
