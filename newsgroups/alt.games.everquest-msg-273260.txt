Subject: Lag in Stormhold on Everfrost server

Can anything be done about the severe lag that I experience whenever I zone
into Stormhold on Everfrost server. The lag is so great that I even have
difficulty turning my character when there are about 5 or six other players in
area and 4 mobs. It is so bad that I either get killed by a mob because I
cannot I attack properly or I have to zone out. This happens either group or
solo. I have experience lag in So Qeynos but not this bad.

THis lag prevents from even attempting Armor quest 3.
