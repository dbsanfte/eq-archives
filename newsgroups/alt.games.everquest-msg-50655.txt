On DAoC, no plans on trying it myself at this time, still having too much
fun with EQ.  But, most of my guild seems to have vanished since it's
release, MOTD tells me which server and realm or somesuch.  I am just hoping
I don't have to go looking for a new guild now, this one has been a lot of
fun, and quite helpful through some tough spots.
