Okay I am sure this has been asked and answered before but I could not
seem to find it. Anyway I have a little dwarf paladin that has been
running around Butcherblock feverishly trying to kill ogres for the
bloodforge armor quest. Corflunk is ALWAYS around but its his
girlfriend Zarchoomi I can never find. The other day I was there with
my gnome cleric and who should appear but Zarchoomi. Since I was too
little to kill her I stayed out of the way but the slayer let the head
to rot. I picked up the head and now am trying to figure out if I
could give one head with the gnome (who has apprehensive faction) and
quickly log in the dwarf to turn in the other head to getthe armor
piece?  I know that technically I could but will the dwarf  even take
the head from the gnome? Any help, advice would be appreciated Thanks
in advance
