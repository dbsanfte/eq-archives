I have 2 characters in Qeynos and one on the island.  There's a quest you
can do that gives a nice low-level dagger.  The dagger's dual-wield and
useable in either slot.  I gave both daggers to my rogue, err, scout on IoR.
If I'd known what he'd be like with them, I'd have named him Sewing Machine.

One rogue, 2 daggers, each with 12 delay.
