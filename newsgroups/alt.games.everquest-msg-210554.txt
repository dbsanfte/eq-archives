I had the same problem for a while, but was able to work around it by
deleting the eqclient.ini file every time before i started EQ. Yes,
this was annoying (because you have to reconfigure your video options
each time) but at least i was able to play.

This never went away, even with the newest video drivers.. but
eventually I bought a better video card and have never had the problem
since.
