I do understand your delema on not wanting to carry around the truckload of
CP, SP, and maybe GP... but think of the various caster types who are busy
medding.
    I, being a cleric, am often very predisposed to medding rather than
looting.  Therefore I get nada in loot except what is autosplit.  Im not a
loot hound, and if I ever loot something that someone wants...and of course
I have no need on the present character or their need is greater than
mine... it is theirs.
    Is it that hard for a monk to just drop the CP, SP, nad GP?...   the
need of the many outweighs the need of one? (not always the case but eh)
    Usualy, when a monk requests autosplit off (usual more of a command than
a request "Turn off Autosplit") I try to explain the reverse side of the
situation...
    Am I just a pain in the ass caster?...  Should monks just lump it... and
drive on dropping their excess weight?  Should I just shut me trap and
become broke?
    I do belive monks are great in groups.. but dont enjoy the aspect of not
getting "any" loot much less Phat lewt...

Hunt well...

Lew
