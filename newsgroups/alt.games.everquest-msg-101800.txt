Yep since feb 11 1999 and a bit before as well (remember when you
could put summoned food and bandages in the bank and they'd stay)
I've never been on a raid, don't have a char over level 35 (hated the
hell levels)

I see EQ as a fantastic diversion from life. I'm not bitching about
it, I still like the game and play it perhaps 4 days a week.
