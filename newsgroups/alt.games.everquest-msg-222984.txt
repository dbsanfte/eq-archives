We did Rak with 65 mage (air pet), 65 ranger, 65 druid, 65 cleric and
the shaman (don't remember level at the time).  I was able to easily
keep pace with the AOE damage with my 64 pet heal, the cleric healed
the ranger and the druid gave us grief for not getting hurt enough.

As you say, the old firepet method is far too hit or miss these days.
I've seen all sorts of posts on how to get the firepet to use his innate
resist - but I've seen those tricks fail an awful lot.
