The argument against having men be mentors to women and vice versa is
the sexual aspect.  Programs don't want to open themselves up to
accusations of sexual misconduct.  Yes, there are OTHER reasons why
men mentor boys and women mentor girls, but the sexual issue is one of
them..

Now, given that, and given that those in the homosexual lifestyle are
attracted to men and women to women, how would you reconcile the
sexual issue with mentoring???

Do those in the homosexual have some sort of special ability that will
prevent them from becoming attracted to their mentoree???

And we have been talking about Big Brother/Big Sister all along..
That's what the article was about.  Sorry if you couldn't discern the
subject matter that was plainly obvious...
