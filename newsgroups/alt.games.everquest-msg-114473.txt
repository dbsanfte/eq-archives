I really don't mind being inspected.
It's taken me a lot of time, effort and some bloody good luck, (both trading
in EC tunnels and through generosity from others for my skill's as a guide
around areas that they don't know), but my character has some pretty nifty
items now.   I was inspected the other day in Oasis by a group who needed a
tank and one of them though I was a blummen twink!!!   The cheek of it.   I
don't believe in twinking but I don't complain when a higher level character
desides to throw me something they no longer have a use for because I've
either A) Provided them with a service or B) Actually taken the time to
befriend them, (some nice chap once gave me a netherbain chittin BP after we
had a damned fine chat, somewhere in the region of an hour and a half, after
which he decided to port off to Luclin to grab another simply because he
could).

If your character is severly under equipped might I suggest you try playing
the game as a social affair rather than a power-levelling exercise.   We are
all there for the fun aspect of it after all, it's a gigantic 3D chatroom
with things to kill in between the socialising.   Who do you think will give
you a better trade price for a giant militia longsword, a friend or a total
stranger?   If all the high level characters started dishing out the goods
they don't need for small PP's then the price of really good equipment might
eventually go down to reasonable prices, (point in case, velium weapons are
hard to even give away now!) but hey I normally sell stuff I don't need any
more for a whole lot less than I originally paid for it if it's to someone I
know or like.   What goes around..........
