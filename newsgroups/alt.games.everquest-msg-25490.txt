With no copyright information within the document, it does not matter how it
was obtained and/or posted actually.  I could have acquired this information
regardless if I were a previous guide or not, through some other means.
They would have quite a difficult time determining just how the information
was obtained.  Though, it all comes down to the fact that the document lacks
the proper copyright naming procedures to give any validity to whether or
not any EULA rules or otherwise were violated.

Please, do take your home lawyer practices somewhere else, as you are far
from being qualified from passing judgement unto me.  :)

Though, as for the document itself;  give constructive critisism.  You say
it would make a guides life more difficult.  Though, I say if anything, it
would make it much easier or atleast a lot less stressful.  Instead of just
giving my opinion/critisism, I will also provide reasonings or logic behind
these opinions/critisisms (aka constructiveness).

Should the regular "user" read this document, then he/she will have a far
better understanding of what a guide CAN and CANNOT do as per VI.  That way
perhaps then guides will NOT be pointed at when it comes to petition time or
"negative" results thereof.  Perhaps then much fewer people will have doubt
in their minds as to whether or not a guide is doing all he/she can do.
Though, should that guide NOT be doing something he/she is supposed to
actually offer, then perhaps that guide should not be a guide.

If anything, it would point the customer service or lack thereof at VI
directly instead of those that VOLUNTEER their services in order to assist
their fellow Norrathian neighbors.  So, now I ask you friend.  Just how will
the posting of such a document inhibit a guides "efficiency?"

As for suspending my account, etc.  I surely do hope they have a strong case
against me.  I see the service they are to provide a "product" and the
software I purchased is a "product."  With that in mind.  They would have
one dirty fight on their hands if they hadnt had a strong case against me.
:)  Some things that come to mind would be Attorney General, Consumer
Affairs, BBB, FCC (since service is accessed via the Internet) and Consumer
Protection Agency.  Oh yes, what a day that will be.  :)  Take care friend.
Sorry if it had offended you.

I have removed the file to do even further research as to whether or not it
infringes upon any copyright issues.  Keep in mind everyone, that I believe
the document that some may have already acquired to be true and correct, as
was acquired by myself in complete form to the best of my knowledge.
