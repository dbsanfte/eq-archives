It's lack of content.
For example, our guild finally cleared all of ToV North including
Vyemm and Vulak.

We have one more thing left:  Kill the fourth warder.

Once that's done, what's left?

Repeatedly farm ToV North for phat lewts?  I can't think of anything
more dull.

Most folks think that uber guilds are doing what they do for the loot.
The loot is largely a side issue.  The guild do what they do because
it's the next step in the challenge.

We started out with Velketor when Velious was first released, then to
Derakor, then decided...ummm, let's go giant faction since that gives
us more shit to kill (remember, this was *BEFORE* they upgraded the
ToV loot so loot wasn't really the major motivation).  We moved to
Klandicar, Zlandicar, Gozzerm, Telk, Lendiniara, Sleepers, Yelinak,
Sontalak, and finally ToV North...

The loot off these aren't really that critical.  Yes, ToV North stuff
is great, but overall it's because the mobs are there and we want to
be the first on the server to kill them.  *THAT* is our motivation.

After the sleeper is awaken, what's left?

Tunare?  I don't think so.

AoW?  Maybe.

Unless SoL gives us another major encounter to shoot for, a LOT of my
guild will quit not so much from disgust or boredom, but simply
because "we're done".
