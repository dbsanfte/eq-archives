Given that Gnaked Gnomes can make the run from AkAnon to Halas, I suspect
you are wrong about making it past LFay.  You might be surprised at what
enough Gnaked Gnomes can accomplish.  But, worst case, we have a great time,
and don't kill but a centurion or two.

As far as doing it on EMarr, the problem is that too many of the
participants don't have an open slot to create a Gnome in, hence we are
looking at doing it on a different server.
