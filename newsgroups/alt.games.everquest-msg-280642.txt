Trust me, Ubisoft was REALLY REALLY bad. I am in a european guild on Stromm, 
of which about 80% of the 100+ members are in the countries supposedly 
served by UBIsoft. Every single one of them, with one or two exceptions, 
signed up with the US based SOE. And this was long before SOE took over UBI 
servers.

UBI was infamous for bad service, server downtimes, slow updates (often as 
much as 4 months behind the US servers), over charges and numerous other 
glitches.
