Does it give me a CD key for the one I "lost"?  Do I have to turn on my
monitor to play EQ?  Are there installation instructions for ShowEQ?  Where
can I find ShowEQ?  I am only selling my time and not the character which is
property of VI/SOE, which I know because I "do" read the EULA before
pressing "Accept" everytime I play..
