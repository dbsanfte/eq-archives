Warrens is pretty good, and the advantage that you'd have right now is
that it doesn't seem to be all that crowded. At level 8, though, you'd
have a tough time in there without a group. Although, by the time you
make it all the way across Antonica you'll probably be high enough that
it'd be a good zone for you. Just watch out on your trip since, as a
necro, you're going to be KOS in alot of the places you would normally
have to stop. Also, BIND OFTEN. Just nicely ask people for a bind, and
you should be okay, but there's nothing worse than dying on one
continent when you're bound on another.
