   Well, the fact that it is free puts the benefit/cost ratio above
zero.  Thanks for your post.  I was too lazy to learn Dvorak, and I did
not want to go too far in unlearning qwerty.  Dvorak users have a
strong tendency to be Dvorak advocates.  I was hoping that 'etni' might
garner a loyal following.  So far no luck, but the first step is just
getting the word out.
   My experience is that it is a nice product.
