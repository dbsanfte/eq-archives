When I was getting baking up, I used batwings from EC and fish from
WC.  One of the vendors next to the lake in WC sells the fish.  I'd
port to WC, get a backpack full of fish, run to EC (baking as I ran),
get a backpack full of wings, run to the tunnel (still baking as I
ran), then sit down at the front of the tunnel and watch the auctions
while baking, and give free TL's to build goodwill.  It worked out
quite well.
