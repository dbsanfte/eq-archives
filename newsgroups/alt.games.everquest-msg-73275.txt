Stay away from the Radeon 7500.  Unless you are on a budget of less than 100
dollars and find the Radeon 7500 for that price on www.pricewatch.com then
move up to the Geforce 3.  Or maybe the Radeon 8500 if you have a bunch
money to spend.

The Geforce 3s and Radeon 8500 are designed for Direct X 8.  The Radeon 7500
and geforce 2s are designed for direct x 7.  They will run direct x 8 but
you will not get all of the features that 8 offers.  I personally have the
MSI Geforce 3 Ti200 that I bought specifically to help out on the SOL
expansion.  I have not been disappointed.  I got it from a local retailer
for 179 bucks and it came with the game sacrifice.  When I benchmarked it it
scored over 50% better than the Radeon 7500.  I was able to overclock it and
I came within 12% of the Radeon 8500.  Best Buy was selling the Radeon 7500
last week for 150 bucks.  I am glad I opted for the Geforce3 instead.
