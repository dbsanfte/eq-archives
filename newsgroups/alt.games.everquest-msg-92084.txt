No, no, no - that's where all the dumb warriors and everyone goes to hunt 
cougars. Go to the island noone is ever on, the middle one with TOFS on it. 
You'll find out that noone is ever on it because its crawling with shadow 
guardians and gnolls (which are probably KOS in wolf form, don't kill them 
though, they have some quests and stuff).

Now, set up camp on the rocky fringe around the base of the island. This is 
on the opposite side of the island from the gnolls and there are no gnome 
pirates on TOFS island, so it is safe to use wolf-form, and in fact 
desirable since it will increase faction with the cougars - you may find it 
easier to pull without getting aggroed by adds (can't remember if they were 
scowling or just dubious without WF). In any case, its useful for the extra 
speed.

Now, hit yourself up with wolf-form, levitate, and regen, wait until full 
mana, and run up onto the top of the island, grab some cougars with snare, 
and drag them back down onto the rocks. Nothing really paths onto the 
rocks, I don't think I've ever seen an add here that wasn't something I 
aggroed on top of the island while setting things up, i.e. theres nothing 
to interrupt your fun mid-kite. Run circles round your four cougars to 
tighten them up then run them up and down the rocks throwing lightning 
strikes at them - welcome to quad kiting. 35 flew by for me.

Oh, don't do this with Midnight, the named cougar... loads of hps and 
faster than normal cougars.
