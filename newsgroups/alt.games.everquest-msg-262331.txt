>Mind you, as long as the rich are getting richer

This statement is the problem with the entire thinking of the Democratic party.

If you are rich and working to get richer, then you are EVIL!!!  If you are
poor and lazy and do not make an effort to change your life by relying on
government welfare and the like, then you are a "hard working. typical" 
American.

Why is it that that the majority of the elderly vote Democratic?  They fear the
loss of their Social Security!!  Threats by the Dems have led to this way of
thinking. (Which will happen in the next 40 years reagrdless of who is
President).

Why is that when it comes to minorities, that they vote nearly 90% Democrat? 
Because the biggest percentage of their population is on some sort of welfare
and/or government aid.

Ask yourself, when Kerry/Clinton/Mr Democratic party says "The rich will get
richer if you don't vote for me"...what is wrong with that happening.  I know
if I get rich, the last thing I want is to have to pay for more lazy families'
children.

The average American "WHO WORKS" pays nearly 50% of their income in some form
of tax.  Whether it is income (federal/state), sales (federal/state/local),
Social Security Tax, Medicare Tax, Entertainment Tax, Luxury Tax, Capital Gains
Tax, Gasoline Tax, Food Tax, Import Tax, Property Taxes (State/County/Local),
Utilities Taxes, Franchise/Excise Tax, Inheritance Tax, Business Tax, License
Taxes, Wheel Taxes, etc. etc. etc.  What is wrong with this picture???

The "Rich" you speak of pay nearly HALF of the taxes in this country.  Without
them, our country would have to end this entitlement nonsense.  End Welfare? 
Heaven forbid we make people go out and work for a living.  Nothing pisses me
off more than to stand in line at a grocery store and see elderly people have
to scrimp because of our failed Social Security system while a female
approximately 25 years of age with 5 kids pays for junk food with our food
stamp system.  Of course we could never end it because it is all "for the
children" as our Democrat bretheren like to preach.

Completely Amazing!  Tax the people who make our economy grow and when we do,
blame the other party for causing it.
