I don't mean to put down shawl 7... and heck, there are shawls 8 and 9 and 10
to think of too.

If you enjoy trade skills and hunting quest drop items, its a worthy item.
Flowing
Thought one is -vastly- superior to a "half-Breeze"... since it stacks with
breeze,
clarity, or C2, and with manasong, it always makes you regen mana faster than
you would have otherwise.  OK, so not -vastly- faster, but every bit helps.

Still, getting shawls one, two, four, five, and six is going to be a long haul,
even
before going into the major effort involved in shawl 7.  Since he won't likely
be
wearing shawl 3, he can get the seal first, then, if he wants to launch into the

quest for 7, he can get working on toes.  Once he gets two, he can turn the
seal into seal plus three at his leisure.
