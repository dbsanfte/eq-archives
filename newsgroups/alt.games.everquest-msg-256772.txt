Hmm... I'm not sure what its under, but its there somewhere.     I have the
opposite setup, with the "begins to cast a spell" message going to main
chat, and spell results going to my combat spam window.  I didn't set it up
that way on purpose, but I liked how it worked out so I kept it.

I'll look when I log in and see if I can pinpoint which filter it is.
