I have seen the same thing happen when killing the Reclusive Ghoul Magus in
Unrest.
Level 50 druid, starfire magus and root to finish him (160 damge).
Pet is of course attacking me after starfire. An instant after the magus
dies
any nearby ghouls jump the pet. (normally one on the same balcony with him)
Funny as all hell.
Loot savants cap, stand back and watch pet die.
