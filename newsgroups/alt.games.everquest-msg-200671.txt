Well it looks like them made the first step by upping the grouping xp bonus.

I guess what they could do is put an increase on both Mana and HP regen 
when sitting and non agroed (i.e. not during combat) this would reduce 
down time, while leaving fights chalanging. During the fight you would 
have to manage your mana / hps but after when you have no agro you could 
quickly regain back to full strength.

The combination of that an the group xp bonus would however make xp much 
faster to come by, so ZEMs would need to be nerfed a bit to keep overall 
chalange reasonable. Ideally nerf "easy" out door zones the most, 
leaving underused / dangerous dungeons the same or only slightly nerfed.

If they could implement a system where you could quickly recover while 
not engaged (i.e. reduce down time) with out changing the dynamic of 
individual fights then it would work. The problem would be working out a 
system that did this.

Perhaps an ability that locks your character in a sitting position for a 
period of time (meditating) so that you can not interact at all during 
that period (say a minute ?), but you regenerate HPs and Mana four times 
as fast while doing it. However if you agro anything during that period 
you don't get any mana or hp back and you get beaten up for the rest of 
the time.

How are those two slightly different ideas ?
The second is a bit like a monk's mend, but less flexible. Note that 
monks are one of the best solo melee characters.
