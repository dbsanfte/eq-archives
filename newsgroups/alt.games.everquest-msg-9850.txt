Bro (slang shortened version of brother) and man are gender male.  Bud
is shortened version of buddy, gender neutral.  Dude is gender neutral
and has a great many uses in current slang.

Dude (Greetings)

Dude! (Greeting, I have not seen you in quite some time)

Duuuuudde (congratulations on your display of prowess)

Duuuude???  (are you hiding behind the door of my darkened apartment
with a large butcher knife and a hockey mask?)
