Yup. The heads, steins, vials of blood, and backbones the AG's dropped
quite frequently would sell to vendors for 3-4pp *each*. Better, the
blood and backbones were stackable. One could turn over a pretty penny
by keeping one or both of the big camps cleared. 

On the up side, there was a 3rd single-spawn camp that hardly anyone
bothered with. It was perfect for a level 6-10 character to turn
profit and xp.

However, the returns for the drops and their frequency were far too
high for the low challenge the AG's offered.
