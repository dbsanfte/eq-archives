------------------------------

NOTE: We are unable to patch "code" right now because we are in the middle
of making some changes to the basic structure of the game. This will delay
fixes for system bugs and updates (such as Alternate Advancement Abilities
and /commands). Please be patient until we can get these much-needed changes
finished. Because these changes affect things such as the database that
stores player characters, we're taking care to make these changes the right
way.

- Changed the way Circle of Summer stacks with other spells

caster instead of taking it away
