Heheh... One of the reasons why I switched to EQ over AC is that my wife
actually willplay EQ, and enjoys it immensely. Tried for the longest time to
get her to play AC and flat out wasnt interested.  One day though I get a
call at work from her asking me where to find greater Lightstones.... and
the rest was history. She started a beastlord on Torvon, and via some shred
purchases in the bazaar, and LOTS of farming of tradeskill goods shes
outfitted quite nicely.

The wife playing though is a two edged sword..... I switched to Torvon from
Vallon Zek, at least partly,  because she wanted me to be on the same server
as her.... She thought that having a pocket druid available would be a
mighty fine thing......:)
