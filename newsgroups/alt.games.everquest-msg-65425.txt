That's great news!
I was about ready to post a thread titled, "The World is Hollow, and I Have
Touched the Sky."  (that title might ring a bell with some of the older
Trekkers out there.....LOL).

One of my biggest problems was that I was seeing the sky and moon below the
ground in a constant flickering.... had to turn my sky effects off to see
anything without getting a migrane.  Coupled with the black box bug, it was
nearly blinding (totally blinding in the smaller window mode where you see
all the controls...whatever that's called....)  Sounds like it's
fixed...I'll have to check it later tonight when I have time....
