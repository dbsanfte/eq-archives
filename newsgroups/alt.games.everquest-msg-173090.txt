You're right that, in these days, 60+ people can do it without
mage pets -

Only problem with that is that, IIRC, Zymool and his buddies aren't
60+.  They are in the level range we were (mid 50's) when we lived
in CoM.

I don't understand why you had problems with adds.

We just pulled the reavers to the little room behind and to
the right of the TR (the one you come to coming down from
sky level - since we always did it via Gfluxing me up
to the sky level, killing Neh for her key, then coming down).

If the mage positions his pet right, the pet pushes him into
the corner.  Any time an add pops up, it attacks the pet, or
comes down for the mage.  The ranger just plunks an arrow in
it, it comes down the hallway behind the TR where the rest
of the group engages and kills it.

During the course of the fight, only a few adds show up.

Also, doing it that way, we never bothered to clear the TR, 
since my ranger buddy could pull Ghiosk's reaver single
out of there.
