}Well, your book uses a ludicrously loose definition of "flame", then.
}That, or you're simply reaching desperately to save face...

It is a loose definition, I'll grant you.  It is critical of the original 
poster, I don't see more being required for it to be a flame.  If you read 
my bit again there, I did suggest that it was the entertaining type of 
flame, and that I was not criticizing you for doing so... just noting the 
reaction.

Every other post seems to be from you.  So you're responsible for 50% of 
the length... not quite a majority, but it'll do. :)  And you are right, 
the information was very easy to come by.  The method I suggested, which 
the original poster actually used, -did- work, after all.

Oblgatory Spelling Flame:  "necessary".
