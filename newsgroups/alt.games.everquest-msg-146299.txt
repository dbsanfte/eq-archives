The original patch message said the funky challenge based xp only applied to
50+.
In fact I noticed a noticeable drop in my xp rate when I dinged from 49 to
50 last night fighting in a group in Lower Guk (which was easier to get
because the 10 or so 55ish chars I see hanging around a lot were not there,
except for the druid camping the SMR).
of course I was doing all blues. Sigh, guess it's off the Velk's for me.
