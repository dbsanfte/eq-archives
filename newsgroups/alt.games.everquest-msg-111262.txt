Having spent the best part of five levels in Stonebrunt, I would say 
"avoid it" unless you have some kind of animal crowd control (i.e, are a 
Ranger or Druid), or can kill greenie adds so fast they aren't an 
inconvenience. I've found myself juggling up to *eight* feared animals at 
one point. It can get tiresome, believe me... If it wasn't for the 
awesome XP and the great money of the Wakizashi quests, I wouldn't have 
bothered.
