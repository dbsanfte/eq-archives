I would submit the possibility that part of this widening of the gap
you mention is due to the welfare/entitlement system we are
propogating.  I used to work at a bank in college and I can tell you
from first hand experience that non-US citizens are coming here,
collecting Social Security *and* welfare checks, cashing them and
heading back home.
I realize this is a small percentage of the issue as a whole, but the
mentality is not.  In fact it's even worse for citizens.

Of course there are many people on welfare or some sort of government
assistance that would rather make it on their own, but my gut says
they are not the majority.  Too many people in the US think they have
rights they don't really have.  The Right to healthcare, the Right to
an education, the Right to fill_in_the_blank, when all we really have
is the Right to Persue these things, not have them given to us.  I
think too many people miss that subtle, yet important distinction.
