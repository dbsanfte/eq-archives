}since nowhere I've seen online or on the
}high street seems to have any in stock at the moment.

I've been wondering about this fr a while... The curiously British 
expression 'in the high street', does that just mean anywhere you'd go 
shopping, or is it a specific shopping district?  Was there some 
particularly famous shopping district on an elevated street?  What's up 
with that?
