presuming that the new rules follow of 200 int is max for mana.  I
specifically remember reading a patch that implied this limit was lifted.

anyhows, you always have to look at the items in question and the ratio of
mana gained for each item.  At lower levels (under 20th), mana items are
usually better if powerful enough.  You'll get more from jade rings /
bracers for mana over int.  After 20th, very roughly, I found that int / wis
is the way to go for mana over jade.

I normally never bothered to try and figure out black sapphire in this
equation, and have read many that say BS earrings is preferable cha or INT
for enchanters.  Still use the 5 cha 2 AC earrings, as I like the cha on
them, being probably the most important stat for crowd control.

Alot of each item is personal taste and you have to look at each piece over
each other.

My first thing would be to upgrade the plat + 4 int ring to something else,
either the spider fur ring which has 3 int with tons of other stats and
mana, or the + 5 int ring.

you also want CON for wizzies, being one of your prime stats.
