No your first description covers it pretty much. Drinking meths will cause
blindness and death

And yes people still drink it, or at least did, to tell the truth , since
seeing that guy in Oz I haven't seen anyone drinking the stuff, this is
probably due to the likes of "Tennents Super" lager (
http://www.theparkbench.co.uk/superlager/af.htm ) which pretty much tastes
the same as meths with a couple of hundred grams of sugar added to it. Also
likely to make you blind but less likely to be a permanent effect.
