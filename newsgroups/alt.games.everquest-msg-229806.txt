Man, and I just wrote about you and the days you came here from FANG to bomb
the newsgroup.

Read your goodbye over there a few days ago, only to see you coming back
here.  =(

Be sure to insult everyone a few times, mkay?

LoY and LDoN are both available via download.  You can buy them
individually, of course, on CD-ROM.  The last compilation was EverQuest
Gold, which contained everything through PoP, which you already have.
