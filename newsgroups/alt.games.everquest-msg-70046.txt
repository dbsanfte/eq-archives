Thanks, will try that if nothing else. I just hate asking or even paying for
a port because I had a high level friend I used to play with and he was
constantly annoyed by it. I guess I figured that unless someone was
auctioning ports off, they'd be pissed if I asked.

Yup, I know all about camo wearing off in a bad place. It actually did that
to me once in RE, but I was close to the zone edge and made it safely
through. My own personal preference is to not run through Kithicor. I hate
that place. I know, it's a lot of running going that way, but going through
Kith just makes me nervous. Maybe I need to enlist the aid of a cleric ;)


 /auction WTB Port to Surefall Glade Please
