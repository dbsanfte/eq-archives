Considering what I recall my original Amiga 1000 being capable of doing 
graphics wise, I'd have to say that SoE is being somewhat less than 
efficient.  In part at least, the blame can be placed on MS as SoE is 
using DX9 in order to be compatible with a variety of hardware without 
coding for specific hardware, whereas with the Amiga, the hardware was a 
fixed set.
