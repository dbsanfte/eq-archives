Dennis sportsmanship applies to sports not to war. War is a zero sum
game where the loser ends up worse off then he was to have entered the
contest at all.  You go to a football game and your team loses you
don't lose anything. Not really.  In war the results of the final
decision are much harsher and so the rules are defined as whatever
works. This is a Wargame. Simple one but wargame nonetheless. 
It's not a sporting event. It's not a baseball game.  It's a wargame. 
Go into it expecting rules and you will lose. The only rules are those
you enforce by yourself using smarts numbers and raw strength.
