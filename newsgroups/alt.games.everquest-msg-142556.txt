Which would mean going to some out-of-the-way place and mindlessly pharming
green con spiders.

If I can't find it in Thurg bank, its already out of my way!  Going to some
god forsaken place like karanas or kaesora and killing spiders for hours....
no thx

girlf has some kind of tailoring skill (something crappy like 40),  so that
would at least solve the making them issue

ive seen % modifier items mentioned..  what would i pay for a gearlock(?)
or is there something better i can go camp? (i know 1 drops in ssra but
thats something the guild smither is gonna get, i wouldnt even think of
asking for a 170 skill)

also if i used a modifier, what actual skill would i need, to get a modified
skill of 170-175?
