   I take beaks every once in a while, a week off here and there. I still go
to the gym everyday, I still read books, and I have friends still. I only
let myself play 2 or 3 hours in a day though, except Saturday I play all
night long and I don't play at all on Sundays. I don't have regular hunting
buddies I just give a shout and join a group, every one seems to want a
level 52 Enchantress in their group. Ohhhh, as for TV mines about 12ft from
the computer so I watch and play *g*. I must say after a week or more away
from EQ I do at first find it hard to get back into the groove but once I do
it's like I never left *lol*. EQ has saved me money, I used to buy pc games,
Playstation, games, and Nintendo games all the time... a good $200 a month,
now I spend just $10 not counting expansions *g*. Oh, if it matters I've
played EQ since the last phase beta.
