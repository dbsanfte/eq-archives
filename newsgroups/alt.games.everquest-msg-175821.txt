First off I want say that I've been wanting Frogloks
since they brought out those ridicuolous (imho) kerrans.

Nothing a cat can do can beat the backwards flip spell cast!

Secondly, if they are allowing shamans and warriors, then why
not monks and beastlords? Out of all the classes offered to races
why does the monk always get the shaft? Since Iksars the only
races that are still able to be monks are humans and them,
why not more dammit! Frogloks are agile enough, no?

So until then, I guess I gotta be a Froglok Shaman!

FROOAAK!
