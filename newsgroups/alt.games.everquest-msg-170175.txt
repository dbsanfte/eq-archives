12

Run3, INT3 (I had 3 in regen but realized what a total waste of points that
was and took advantage of the "refund" given to us a while back)

The other 6 were spend on ...hmmm...can't find it at castersrealm and I
don't feel like searching it out.  I spend them on the ability that
increases Damage Avoidance (as opposed to damage mitigation).  A friend
thinks I'm nuts and he went with durability...but all things being equal, a
few extra hitpoints aren't going to keep me alive while avoiding a hit at a
crucial time while casting Mezz will have a much better chance of saving me.

> What are you planning to get next?

I'm not sure.  If I'm able to spend the final 6 points in PoP abilities and
still get my new title, I'll toss in whatever is necessary to cast illusions
on friends. <g>  None of the AA are that great to me so I might as well have
fun.

> Do you wish you hadnt bought certain abilitys?

Happy with my choices so far.
