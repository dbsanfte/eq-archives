Well the discussion is ongoing - At http://forums.shadowknight.org you can 
find numerous threads on the subject.

I used to beleive that it was the delay of the pet rather than the damage 
that was affected - but I can't prove it as yet. Whether I give my pet a 
weapon or not, it seems unaffected.

So as of now, I just pass useless stuff over - In the belief that its better 
than nothing.

Happy hunting
