}Seems to directly contradict what PBS claimed before:
}"No HIV-positive character was planned in the U.S. version."
}Now PBS is saying there are conditions that WOULD bring the HIV Muppet

}Hmmmmmm Sounds like planning to me..

(A) As others pointed out, you're conveniently ignoring the word 'if'.
(B) You're also ignoring that the first quote makes no reference to 
    muppets with HIV at all.  They may, after all, tailor their response 
    to this different audience.

Sounds like reassuring people that they will make a plan someday if they 
feel they need to.  And again, you've pointed out a fine example of 
statements that don't contradict.  Reading is Fundamental.
