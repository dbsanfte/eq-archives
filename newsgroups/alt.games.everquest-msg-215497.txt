   Yeah, that was funny too.  But also considered he just in all
likelihood made "don't group with" list of 5 other people.  Sooner or
later, he's gonna want to get into a group with one of you, and get
denied.  Who knows how much experience and plats he may have really
screwed himself out of, in the long run?  And this probably wasn't a
fluke.  This guy will probably be getting lots of player generated karma
during his career.
