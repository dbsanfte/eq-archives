No, you once in a blue moon see some gm event that is hopefully not
the stupid ass "I want to play!" one (which seems to exist to only
aggrivate players) and somehow manage to roleplay in it or help a gm
somehow in some way that gets you a coin. Most players will never see
gm events and very few of those gm events will be a type that rewards
a coin. For the most part GM events on regular servers more or less
mean, RUN RUN FOR THE HILLS! Not sure if all the content people they
hired for Legends, such as the rumored ex person from the Gemstone III
premium service event thing, will somehow trickle over some more
quality events to the live servers (though they would still be very
rare)
