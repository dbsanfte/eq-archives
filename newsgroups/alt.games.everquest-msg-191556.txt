   Truth is NO thay are not smarter. THINK about the ground troops have
reporters showing the bad guys were thay are. Some stupid officer sure
go head film us and send it live to the WORLD. I see no reporters from
CNN reporting troop movements from the other side.

Last time I was in the Gulf we was stoping the ships looking for
smugglers and our CO would be on the 1MC telling us to stop Emailing
were we were hideing 2 or 3 time a week, or we would have our E-mail
shut down.
