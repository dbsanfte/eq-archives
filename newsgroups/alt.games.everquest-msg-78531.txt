Coding it that way should be possible, yes.  Why don't they? Only
Firiona Vie knows for certain.  Personally, I wish they would allow me
to put 20 of each fletching or baking component in, click combine, then
the program figures the chance of success for each set, tells me "you
failed 6 times" and hand me the other 14 successes.  Man my finger gets
sore cranking out fish rolls!!  And that wouldn't be that hard to code
either, for any number of components no less.

For x = 1 to y (where y is the number of components put in)
z = rnd (100)
if z less greater than or equal to skill level then success
else fail
next x

See??
