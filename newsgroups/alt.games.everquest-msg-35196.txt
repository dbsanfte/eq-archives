he wants to be bound before he continues his journey to EK. I assume so that
if he dies, he doesn't have to begin his trip all over again.

he can't be bound in High Pass if that's his intention, since, in order to
get there, he has to go *further* than his destination.

Now, once he reaches EK, it might make sense for him to get rebound in
Highpass.
