Too rare.. infact, since I cannot seem to get one, I believe they should
nerf them as they are too powerful, expecially for the monk type.  I say
retroactive nerf all the way.


PS - Please do contribute to the level 1 twinkage society.  If its twink
items these pissing and moaning newbies want, then I say give it to them.
An Ulthork Hide Tunic will go a long way for a level 1.... more so after
they die.  Heck, anything with some positive stats AND negative HP's will do
the number.  Boy thats a funny site to see a level 1 die.... about 20 times
or so.  Its even more convenient now that they come back with all their
stuff...
