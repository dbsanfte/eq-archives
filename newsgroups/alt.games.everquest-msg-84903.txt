Only against specific mobs.
Hell, I think only against Yelinak.

Statue isn't affected by GB.
Sontalak isn't affected by DB.

Vindicator is the only one in that list where wizards might be
useful--unfortunately for them giant's bane doesn't have that "damn
near zero aggro" that dragon's bane does.  

The sad fact is there's no giant where GB works that you actually
*need* GB.  Tormax is the only one that comes close and he's drop dead
easy when you get aggro control down.
