   Ok, I'll be the dummy that admits that I 
don't know what the difference is.  But I'll
guess.  Harmtouch, from the limited (really
limited) experience I've had playing one, is
a DD spell that does a fair chunk of damage
based on the SK's level.  
    So.... Deathtouch = instant death for the
lucky winner that gets it for Christmas?  And
if so Geez!  Which mobs get it so I can stay
the hell away from them?

Annie  <--- Would be equally happy to learn 
            how she could get it for herself.
