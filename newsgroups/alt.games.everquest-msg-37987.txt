My current SNEAK skill is 113 at level 40.

Last night, I spent about an hour using the SNEAK skill and walking
around Ill Omen with no increase.   This morning, all I did was click
the SNEAK button on and off for almost another hour.

Is the SNEAK skill bugged?   Anyone know what you have to do to
increase this skill?
