I have a fairly low opinion of most politicians . I would trust bush to run
my family buisness and not go bankrupt, gore would go bankrupt. This in no
way says i would prefer him to lead my nation though.

As a percentage of yearly gross national product our deficit is smaller now
than it was under clinton when adjusted for inflation. Also significantly
smaller than it was under reagan and carter. You have just exampled one more
time that 98% of people are completely ignorant of economics though.

Yes a cluster bomb is a large bomb that splits into many submunitions and
thus spreads a pattern of explosions over a large area. The impact of the
individual submunitions is not great but capable of great harm against soft
targets. It is a very effective weapon for clearing out dense jungles with
people hiding in them . It kills well. Since I have already stated my belief
that the job of a military is to kill people and break things I am not sure
what your point is. If cluster bombs are dropped on urban areas with large
noncombatant populations I might even be forced to offer a stiff note of
protest. If they are dropped on jungle areas with a few enemy combatants I
am not in the least bit concerned. Same for napalm, fuel air explosives,
nukes , etc.

I do not see the men of our armed forces as the bad guys, I do see them as
the good guys. I dont trust goverments at all though , especially not mine
since it can have a direct effect on me !

I am not confused. Yes we have spies as well and they indeed aid greatly in
the killing of the enemy and the breaking of the enemies toys. I am not
aware of any of our special forces hiding behind noncombatants. While I
would be saddened to learn the details of how captured americans are treated
I would not be particulalrly suprised by them. I am forced to wonder if you
would be.

Most of the world certainly does kill its people for crimes, most of the
world also engages in torture. It is telling that a few countries in old
europe consider themsleves most of the world though. This would be an
example of math and the other hard sciences I previously mentioned.

china
russia
mexico and other south american countries
ALL of the middle east
etc ...
