Wow, as of 11:45pm PST, the network status page showed all servers
DOWN except AB, Al'Kabor, and Escape from Norrath.  And the patch
info at the bottom said the server were coming down at 4am for 8
hours.  Wow, you don't suppose they finally learned how to update
the page, do you?

Ah, okay, now it's noon and the servers show as UP, but I can't
connect to any of them.  (I can login and get to the server select
page, but the servers shown there are Locked.)  So the world is
back to normal.  Guess I'll take the opportunity to transcribe the
News page from the patch:

*** Items ***

- Keikolin's Mindhaze Sleeves now have a chromatic damage focus
effect instead of a magic damage focus effect.
- Goru's Girdle of the Deceased now has Improved Parry IV instead
of Improved Parry III.
- Increased the damage on Fleshmelter, Lethar's Maul.
- Ice-Striated Iron Orb should now function properly.
- Reduced the weight on hotzone augments.
- Items should now show their appropriate cast times.

*** Miscellaneous ***

- Playing as a shroud that is significantly below your regular level
now gives reduced experience while in a group environment just like
it does while solo.  [I'm guessing this is the exploit that was
mentioned on the forums as getting plugged in this patch.]
- Instruments are now considered one-handed items regardless of which
hand the instrument is in so you can wield an instrument and another
item at the same time.  You cannot wield two instruments at the same
time.
- Healing a pet now generates much less agro than before.  Beware
though, healing pets will still be noticed by NPCs and they will still
be unhappy with the healer if the pet dies.
