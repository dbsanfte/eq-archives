This is what happens when you group with twinks, especially monks. I've had
exactly the same problem before, twinked monk and untwinked Warrior, holding
aggro off a Monk wielding two KD's and wearing an FBSS when you have a
couple of Yaks (This was When Yaks cost over 1k and KD's closer to 8k) is
not going to happen.

What level (my example took place when I was high 30's) and what was the
monk wielding?
I hear of these things happening to new players more and more. When my
friend and I have been p/l alts we have both grouped with new players that
have apologised for their equipment and explained they are new...seems they
get dumped from groups because they can't hold their own with all the
twinks.
