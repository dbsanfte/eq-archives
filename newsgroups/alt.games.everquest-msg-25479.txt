Hey Whittle. A fellow TP player finally.
if you looking to join a guild look us up find someone of you level in my
guild and play with them. if you know your stuff. and you want to join us.
they will get an officer to you.
in general though look up all the people who are online and see what level
they are and how many. at level 20 join a fun social type guild. Some nice
ones on are server are. the one im a part of.

Midnight Unity.
100+ people not including Alts. a guild devoted to having fun and helping
out those lower in level by passing on gear we dont need but they can use.
ive been in Split paw with some people for 2 weeks now so every druid and a
few others 24 and under have full paw gear and Fine steel. if they didnt
have better already. we do have more druids then anything else. close 2nd is
magicians. but everyone is welcome, we are short on clerics and SK.

Silent Moon and Keepers Of The Glade
There both very helpful and friendly people,
often have raids that go well

Crimson Banditos
in my opinion stay clear of this guild of jackasses, the leader is a moron
who tells anyone who has a problem with one of there people to fuck off.
more then one of there members have been rude to more then one of my guild
mates and others as well. Bunch of ninja looters and Trainers, but you can
form your own opinion

The "Uber" Guilds:
Intrepid
best of the best. they hold many server records. First to kill this mob
first to get into this place Etc:
40+ only
House Hydra
40+ only very selective of there people. dont ask them they ask you to join
type
Obsidian Pact
very large very raid heavy guild. There on many servers, not sure if they
have a level requirement. i would think so
Alliance of the Griffin
no level requirement. large. watch out though from what i hear they kick
people out if you even dent one of there MANY rules. as a result there very
organized and efficent.

Race specfic guilds are a bad idea i think limits your classes on raids.
unless you look for other to join you raid from outside you guild. there is
a Small people guld called
The Short Ones
and a Female character only guild called
BladeQuest

When is it safe to run?
if you have a cleric. when there OOM and your tank(s) are down to less then
2 bubbles of health and facing more then 1 almost dead blue each. i find
most people will be fine with you running if you OOM or almost out of
health. and there is no chance of a heal coming your way. Make sure you say
RUNNING! to let them know. ive run into more then a few tanks who think its
there duty to stay till everyone has made it out.
if you run rather then dying most people will be ok with it. ive died a
couple times cuz i was stubborn and was thinking "that mob isnt going to
push me out of zone" died a little won a little.

email me if have any more questions.

The opinions expressed in the preceding ramble are those of ME and dont not
nesscesarly reflect those of the rest of norrath.
