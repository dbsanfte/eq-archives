Yep.  There is a rectangular region in the center of TD that is off limits. 
When the boat zones in, the back half of it is placed in that region.

Why is it off limits?  I have no idea.  If you're outside the cabin on the
rear of the boat, you can jump off and swim around inside the offending
area.  There's nothing there.  Just water and ocean bottom.
