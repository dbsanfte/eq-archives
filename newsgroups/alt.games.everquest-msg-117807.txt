"Formally live" - wearing all your gear?  As opposed to informally
live - standing around in your underwear?

To the best of my knowledge, this isn't a bug.  It's the way the
spell's intended to work.  Target someone, you get their corpse.
Target no-one, you get the nearest corpse.  It's a very convenient
spell when your pet runs off and kills something out of your sight,
especially if you told him to "guard here" and now he's off guarding
some plot of land you don't care about.
