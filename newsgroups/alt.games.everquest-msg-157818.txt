DAoC addressed many of the problems EQ has...All of my friends that played
it have either returned to EQ or just quit.
There is no question DAoC is better written and thought out, it just isn't a
better game. Shadowbane addressing the same problems will not necessarily
make it a better game.

We've heard it all before, as soon as something better comes out I'd say 80%
of us will be off...just nothing has.

What you are suggesting is going to cost VI/SOE time and money that they
really don't need to spend, these patches have been running at these times
since around the release of RoK, people seem to be able to cope with it and
EQ is still top of the pile, even with the release of AC, AO and DAoC.
As I stated earlier in the thread, these patches have already been moved to
3am starts from 8 or 9am ones, allowing an evenings play (assume the patch
didn't break anything) for Europe.
