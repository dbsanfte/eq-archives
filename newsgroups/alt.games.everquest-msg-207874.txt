Just thought I'd toss in one I didn't see mentioned:  Beastlord.
Contributes mana regen, slow, DPS, and a little extra healing.
My Paladin did well duoing with every pet class, and BST's add
two things a Paladin has none of (mana regen and slow) while also
being strong in an area Paladins are (usually) weak in (DPS).
