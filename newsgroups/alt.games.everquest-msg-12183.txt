Definately depending on server, and also on the "memory"
verus "current reality" abilities of the person purchasing
them.

HQ Bear pelts were once valuable because they could
be used to make 10 slot packs which high level characters
would stuff thier banks with, giving them 16 extra slots,
the equivalent of 2 extra backpacks of storage.
As incredible as it seemed to lowbies, paying 100pp
per pack, or a total of 800pp for a full bank of these
things, was deemed well worth it, tailoring was a little
practiced field and the HQ bear pelts dropped rarely
and only on a very limited range of bears.

As the rarity of the pelts was part of the driver for the
high price of the packs, 30pp was no more than a
little high.

Subsequently, though, the drop rate has been fixed to
work as intended, now bears of all sorts drop the things,
though admittedly rarely, so that you can hunt them for
exp over a wider range of levels, in a wider range of
zones, I'd say there are easily ten times as many HQ
bear pelts out on the market.  Logically the price of
them should have plummeted to 3pp each, but that hasnt'
happened.

Second, though, ten slot packs purchasable from
vendors have been introduced, none costing even the
worst cha/align combo characters more than 10pp.
If you want a pack for the originally desired purpose
of increasing bank slots, paying more than this for
a tailored backpack would be silly.

Now tailored packs are weight reducing, and many
people actually use them in the field, so that boosts
their value somewhat, I see them realistically fetching
20pp, even 25pp these days.  Due to the long memory
of players, I see people auctioning to sell the pelts at 25pp...
but I don't see a lot of tailors paying that price.  Even
10pp seems outrageous, but there's the "reward the newbie"
mentality to consider as well.

If people on your server haven't figured any of this out,
prices could be a -lot- higher, but I think you are all
a little wacko.

I've seen people killing bears by the dozen and literally
leaving the ruined, LQ, and MQ pelts to rot.  When
a little effort and some spiderling farming will turn those
into a fairly steady income at an average of 3pp per
bear (the ruineds aren't profitable, but the LQ and HQ
pelts turned into backings sure are) I think you can see
why I'm saying that -that- is where the money is, not
the occaisional HQ and leave the rest to fester buffaloe
hunter mentality.  Add to that the fact that cats and wolves
also drop equally usable LQ MQ and HQ pelts, so you've
tripled your prey finding rate and at least doubled your
"something that's good exp" rate and your workable
zone rates, and you leave the HQ bear trade in the distance.

PS someone recently pointed out that a large bag seems
to make more sense than a backpack, for most characters.
If you are concerned enough about weight to want to
shell out actual plat for some weight reduction, then you
likely can't afford to be filling those extra slots up anyway,
and the bags weigh less than the packs and cost less.
Haven't looked into it, but if you can use a LQ or MQ pelt
to make an 8 slot with almost the weight reduction of
a heavier more expensive 10 slot...well that might be a much
more worthwhile plan, history not withstanding.
