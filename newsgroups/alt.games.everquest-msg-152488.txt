This was an impossible choice.

1) should we stop giving you new content, so the game
stagnates?

2) should we stop fixing things, particularly after we
add a new (and therefore buggy) expansion, so
the game never gets better?

I voted "don't ask" although I doubt that vote will
do any more good than my old write in candidacy
for "none of the above is acceptable" on presidential
and some other offices on election day.

If I had to vote, I'd be forced to go for 1), because
2) included the example of "add mindnumbingly
stupid graphics content that everyone will be forced
to turn off immediately if they want to do anything
other than solo light greens in unpopulated zones"

I honestly think the Shadows option must have been
included to "force" more 1) responses.  You know
that commercial on TV, where they show the
two sandwiches, one toasted, one not, but with
a pile of cash the announcer calls lettuce?

Players clearly prefer that we stop issuing new
content, according to this poll.

Bergh "wants REAL new content, and finds
it henious that they would suggest for a moment
that they stop fixing and revamping old content."
