I think it's more accurate to say that he doesn't fully "get" the game of
make-believe.  The game of make believe can only hold up until mom shouts
up the stairs "have you fed the dog yet, honey?", and then your armor has
reverted to cardboard and your swords are just foam baseball bats again.

Or maybe he gets it, he just doesn't enjoy it anymore.  Which is
fine...but I will personally never compromise on what is my oldest, and
most treasured, hobby.  I was playing dress up at 5 years old with a
wonder-woman mask and a plastic tiara and paper wand and I'm still going
strong today. :D

As one person said on another board...if I want to play games with money,
there is this game that is a WHOLE lot more exciting and rewarding called
NASDAQ.
