What I heard was you have to kill them all within 1 hour for a chance to
start the named cycle

We did get some named pops, it wasn't a proper guild raid though (the leader
wasn't an officer) and we couldn't find our way to the named mobs lol :)

Long pull, but you have 3 mobs instead of 12+ (the 1 roamer, then king, then
queen)

> ramp.  We can rush the king room, recover and rebuff, then pull the queen.

I setup in the corridor after the false wall too.. when I lead or pull
chardok royals though its generally for other (smaller) guilds, so no
kamikaze charging the kings room or anything, I single/double pull his
guards until its just the king left... chardok is such an easy place to
wipeout, and when im leading it i dont have the resources of a guild bank to
pay for a shitload of coffins

Heh on the first pull with my guild of queen (single pull in library) she
got pushed through the wall, summoned everybody and wiped them out lol
