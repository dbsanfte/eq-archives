A fucking joke?   lol please.  I can think of several raids, where if the MA
loses agro you at best lose half your raid, and at worst wipe out.

Ever fought a mob like Statue, Idol, Vindi, AoW, Sontalak?   Believe me only
the better warriors MA that fight, or your c.ring sometime in the near
future.

Any idiot can play a warrior and "be a tank", anybody can be a cleric and
"cast a heal",etc.. not just anybody can tank the AoW.  Not just any cleric
can know exactly when to stun, when to root, when to sacrifice <a group
member> to stop the whole group from wiping, how to heal effectively when
facing a mob (unslowable) that hits for ~1100

How many raids you done where positioning didn't matter?   Whether to
protect the caster from AoE's or not, because I can think of a LOT of raids
where positioning is RAID CRITICAL.

Even gimp mobs like Maestro are pinned into the wall in the TR, Dain has no
AE and is pinned.  For statue/AoW/Tormax we "march" them up and down
(meaning the whole raid can hit the mob from behind and do more damage/take
less damage), and believe me even some warriors can't do this right.

The Itraer Vius is vital positioning, Yelinak is vital positioning (push him
into the water and your C.Ring)  Aary is important, push him round the
corner so he Ae's your casters and nobody is going to have mana.    Vyemm is
*vital* cuz make him face the wrong way, and your summoning bodies to the
zoneline from in the lava after he flung your whole raid

Dozekar is another we pinned in the corner in our old HoT days (along with
all HoT mobs actually)

But your right, mr man of experience from 1 AoE raid.

Out of interest, how many non-aoe raids have you done?
