I have noticed that when I take the boat, my stamina goes down (as thought I
were running) and sometimes the bar drops to just plain zero, but then,
sortof magically pops back up again to full (and this before I zone). We
were talking about swimming (thanks JaZZ, for the great advice!), and I got
to wondering -- if the bar drops and nothing bad happens when you're on
the -boat-, then what difference does it make (so long as your face and nose
are above the water line), if your bar drops down to zero while
you're -swimming- (or paddling)? ( unless you're running from mobs, it seems
not to, to me) But running from mobs with sta going down, THAT seems to
matter. The rest of the stamina bar thing seems not to, though I am by no
means knowledgeable (sp?) with regards to stats and how they work. JaZZ...
anyone... comments on how this works? Does anyone know but the dev leads at
Verant? ;) How come it matters when some dame thing is chasing you, but it
doesn't matter on the boat? Just because the boat is a means of "running",
without the mobs beating on you? Sheesh, I have NO idea. (yeah, like that
was an insight ;) )
