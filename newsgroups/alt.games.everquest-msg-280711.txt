Selos works, as does chains... in fact I've done some pure bellow kiting 
with no run speed modifiers at all, some changes to run speed back about 
a year ago mean that mobs are no longer about 5% faster than PC's, so if 
you start with a lead you can retain it with a little care.

On the other hand, at 30 kiting isn't a very good option for a bard; 
remember, we're looking at the short range DD Bellow and the decent 
Fufil's as the only sources of ranged damage.  With my current drum that 
means
22
22+15
22+15
22
22+15
22+15
22
assuming I don't have to maintain a run speed modifier... but also 
assuming I manage to loop just right to maintain bellows range at all 
times while staying out of melee range.  Admittedly, a huge improvement over
15
15
15
15
15...
But its sure doesn't hold a candle to stacking DOTs.

I'd rather stick to good honest charm killing, even one on one thats a 
MUCH higher DPS, as I get double the DPS of one mob, and mostly I kill 
mobs that are red to me.  Without a SOW potion or something along those 
lines, I'm not going to charm swarm, as I'll end up losing more exp on 
the "whoops" deaths than I will gain swarming... but done right, its 
more like 5 times the DPS of a single mob; and better than anything 
anyone not twinked to the gills is likely to be able to lay down at my 
level.
