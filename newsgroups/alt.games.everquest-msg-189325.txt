In so far as which game to get I would most definitely stay away from
SoE games. They have exhibited as complete lack of concern for
players/customers by generally taking the attitude "if you don't like
it tough". Stick with the newer games/companys out there, they are
still hungry to please customers.

As for EQ its become fairly boring and pointless. Mistakes they made
keep compounding and mudflation has about killed the fun factor. Seems
the only way they fix anything lately is to nerf some class into near
uselessness or worse. The uber guilds get handed the fat loot and xp
tables then those same tables get nerfed when the rest of us get
there. EQ has exceeded its limits and SoE has shown its not the
company we wish it was, no amount of denial will change that. 

Gave my stuff away and deleted the chars yesterday feels kinda sad but
also pretty good. Enough is enough....3 years was too much.
