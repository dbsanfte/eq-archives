Improved Damage focus effects are 1-20% calculated each time you cast, so
no, they aren't all fixed.

When you have a 270 per tick dot, Burning Affliction makes a world of

Improved Damage on 20 point nukes is as pointless as Burning Affliction on
12 point DoT's.  The focus effects work better on higher level (and hence
higher damage output) spells.
