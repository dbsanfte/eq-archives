Invis vs Undead is a nearly useless spell line, zones in which it is
really functional are few and far between, in fact only LGuk
comes to mind.  Normally if undead appear at all they appear in
company with living mobs that are also KOS to all.  If ItU would
stack with normal invis this would be a very handy line, but as
it is, I think I've used it two or three times other than in LGuk

Most annoying are the Luclin mobs which are damageable by
anti Undead spells, but see thru ItU but not thru Invis.

At any rate, I surely don't hate you for having ItU... pity you
for the wasted spell line perhaps, but not hate.

Snare.  Snare is a wizard's prime ability. Root is very very clumsy compared
to snare.  Snare everything. Root only on occaision, and always wince about
the wasted mana.  Clerics with the exception of Dark Elves (who can get
an item with a very poor snare) can't snare and thus are never going to be
wizards.  We also can't evac, succor, or translocate or TL to bind (other than
that glorious self only TL to bind) which frankly are why wizards are invited
along in groups.  Why are wizards and druids basically interchangable?  Because
both classes can snare and evac, and the other details of what they can do
pale in comparison to those.

Clerics can't snare, can't evac, and thus can't mimic a wizard.  Saying that
they can
would be like saying that because iksar monks can forage they are the same thing

as rangers.
