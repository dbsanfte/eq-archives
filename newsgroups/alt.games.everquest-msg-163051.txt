Good point.  For a caster, even a Cleric, I agree it's best to use
the points at the high end.  For a melee though, I've found it much
better to get the skill up into a functional range fast.  Unless
you're grouping with friends who know what you're doing and approve
of it you are flat out cheating a group if you're 40+ and using a
weapon at 35 skill.
