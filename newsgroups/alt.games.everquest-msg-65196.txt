Through all the tribulations of trying to upgrade two machines for
Luclin, I have at least had the benefit of learning some stuff. (Oh,
it's very VERY fucking educational. <g>) In case any of you are still
wrestling with the idea of upgrades and what have you, I have found that
the most important performance factor for the "new and improved" EQ, out
of the three in the subject line, is the video card.

Here's what we wound up with thus far:  Two machines. One is a Gateway
with a P3-500 and 384 MB SDRAM.  The other is an IBM with a P3-600 and
512 MB of RDRAM.  You'd think the IBM would do better, being superior in
both of those aspects. However, the Gateway is now running the new EQ
just fine.  Tiru was able to run into the center of the Gfey spires last
night in the middle of a serious *crowd* of people and turn ballarina
circles and the video kept up just fine. With my faster processor, more
RAM IBM machine, I only *approached the NK spires with *three* people
there, and my frame rate dropped to about the equivalent of how fast I
could have painted the pictures myself with crayons.

The difference? The video cards. The lower RAM and processor Gateway now
has a 64 MB RAM Geforce 2 MX 400 video card in it. The IBM still has a
Matrox Millenium 16 MB video card. This seems to make all the difference
in the world to the new and improved EQ. 

Hope this helps somebody. Be aware of this information while shopping
and upgrading.
