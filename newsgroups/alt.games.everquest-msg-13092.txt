>I'd just like to have a start of poll. How many people here buy SoW potions?

Since I make them at cost for myself (well, for my twinks...dire wolf boots
handle all my personal spirit of wolf needs...I almost never mem the spell
itself), I am not inclined to buy them ;)

>And how much would you pay?

100 platinum for a 10 dose is pretty standard.

Someone did the math, and found out that for the cost of Tboots, you could
have like 700 contiious hours of SoW (which is faster than tboots) via
potions. Relative cheapness, and faster running speed both lead up to
people continuing to buy them.

IVU hardly sells at all. Very rarely you will sell one, but since so many
(what, 5?) classes can cast the spell directly, it is rare to need it. I
keep one in my inventory at all times tho.

Shrink sells decently, but not a huge moneymaker.

The new DS potion has been known to sell, but the rather obscene ingrediant
cost for it tends to cut down on interested parties.

The new field of bone potion is easily the biggest seller for gates, too
bad the herb to make it is not sold in halas or firiona :)

Make no mistake about it...alchemy is a highly effective way to LOSE money.
It is basically impossible to get any high level of skill and make money.
I've spent roughly 20k platinum getting my skill to 151, and I've made back
maybe 2k in potion sales.
