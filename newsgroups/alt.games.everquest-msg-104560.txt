Oh duh, you meant the cleric doing AoE stuff. I thought you meant getting
the necro to multi kite. See how much more interested in Tarre than Tiru I
am?

No, that would require A. a desire to play the cleric and B. going to the
moon.

My machine is not optimim for the moon. I can tolerate the lag for
Shadowhaven/Bazaar/Nexus, but the last time I went hunting with a partner,
someone died before I knew they needed a heal. And when I started a kitty
beastlord- man, Kudos to Verant for the WONDERFUL Vah Shir quests!!- I get a
migraine after playing half an hour up there. Until I get a new machine,
adventure up there is out of the question. (hence the joke to Arolpin about
trading a machine for homebrew)
