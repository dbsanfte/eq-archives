The critter you need is annoyingly uncommon.  The GOOD news is that SolA has
one of the better xp modifiers in the game and there's plenty of stuff you
can kill there for xp.

Back to the bad news:  gonna have to have help.  Good news is that I think
you said you could get guildmates there.  Try to bring someone who knows the
zone (old timers may).  It's the inferno gob wizard that drops it, right?
He can spawn in many areas of the zone (it's just another type of gob so
there COULD be 20 up at once though I doubt if it's ever happened <g> ).
Easiest to get to from the zone in is around the barroom and areas south of
there.

Good news is that in that area:
- Bartender: drops a couple pieces of good stuff for non-twinks
- Err, I forget the guy's name next door but he can drop a couple of ok
items.
- Mage can get a fire gob skin if he's doing his robe quest
- Rogue can get some purse from Lynada (sp) if he's doing the Burning Rapier
quest
- Druids (and a few other classes, PROBABLY war, cle, rng and a few others,
but not pure INT caster :( ) can get a fire gob totem, +10 FR (excellent
resist kit item)
- High Priest drops either an infravision ring or some totem with 50 mana
- Jailer (I think) drops a weight reducing bag.  Not great but pretty good.

SolA is NOT a waste of time at level 33.  The goblins you'll see in that
area are Flame, Fire, Inferno and Solusek (in order of difficultly, easiest
first).  Flamers may be light blue at 33...POSSIBLY green, but the rest are
definitely blue.
