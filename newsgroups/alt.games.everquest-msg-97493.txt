Yes,  I want to thank you for doing this to me
NOT!!!!

You or some one matching your discription did this to me a week or so
ago.  While I CLearly had AFK displayed. I bested the Orcs trained on
me. but I really thought you were a idiot for doing this.

Personally I think you are an Asshole and a jerk  but I just decided
you are not worth my time to type this
