Well I meant grouped with a bard singing area songs.  Recently somebody
in-guild bitched about a bard group member getting him faction hits for mobs
he hadn't hit (was in kael), but a bard replied saying "it doesn't give
other people faction hits anymore"

i also recall a long while back, a rogue was grouped with a bard who pissed
him off (the bard was telling them things you do and DONT do when grouped
with a bard, or you feel their wrath.. bla bla)

So the rogue decided he was going to give the bard a faction hit, he sneaked
into nToV, hit the mob another guild was killing, then ran back to get in
ae-song range.

Stupid, but pretty funny at the time heh (poor Druids in PoG tho, huh)

Btw I ported into WL this morning (about 5 hours ago) and Wuoshi was up
(agrod me) and when I FD'd, nobody else who the AE had hit was on the agro
list.

I recall a wuoshi fight before too, where I only chealed with my cleric,
whilst my monk was FD (so no agro).  My cleric got constantly got hit with
AE's, but again no agro/faction hit when he died.
