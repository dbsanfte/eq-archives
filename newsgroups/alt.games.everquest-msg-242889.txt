When I need cash I do some of the most basic things. Spider Silks can be
very profitable. I go to the Karanas for silks a spider there can have up to
6 silks on each spider. I go to the bazaar and sell them for 1pp under the
cheapest price there. Most of the time its about 7.5-8.5 plat per silk. If
you come up with 100 silks you can have about 850 plat right there. Karana's
are a max lvl of 35-40 so even a cleric could solo there and walk away with
a ton of silks. Its not like killing Hill Giants but its a start.

Also keep your ears to the ground and look for things people need and find
ways of getting them. Another thing to do is looking up good deals in the
Bazaar. Maybe you see a toon selling Silver Chiten Hand Wraps for 2.5k plat
and you know that people are buying them for 3.5k. Its a gamble buying them
but you should be able to turn a quick 1k buying them and turning around and
reselling them. (Prices may very from server to server, and what is hot and
what is not.) What I'm saying is be creative, don't depend on someone to
hand you the loot, make or farm your own loot.
