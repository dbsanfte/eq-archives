I am on The Nameless.  I always find my way back to my GM, but it seems like
forever with all the turns and circles I go in.
When I created my DEF it took me 2 hours to get out of the city to the
forest.  All the rodents had turned green and I was not getting any loot,
maybe 1 whiskers to every 5 rodent I killed.  (this is why I always have
money in the shared section of the bank).
