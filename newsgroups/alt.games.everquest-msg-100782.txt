Actually DL is awesome at that level. Just stay close to the caves near the
druid ring. My 34 wizard was kiting 2 of those Yetis, and when a couple of
guildmates (36 Wizzy, and 38 Druid) showed up we went to the other side of
the cave and pulled craigs, breas, drachnids, yetis, and those
dragvolg(spell check here) thingie, but man they hit hard and are fast even
with snare of em. Got 2 yellow in about 3 hours last night and cant wait
till our chanter guildmate gets on this weekend for some massive exp
grinding!
