Dual wield ?

Carsten already mentioned Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the
Bloodsworn,and dont tell me 2handers outdamage this combo.

When were the last excessive parses to compare dual wield with
2Handers taken? - I bet they are pretty old,from a time when there
were no such weapons commonly available like CHoS or SotB.

Persdonally I ran extended tests with Copper Hammer(20/13 + 179DD) and
Razor edged ShanTok(20/12 ,no proc) against WarMarshalls Blade
Staff(2Hander,28/31, no proc).

Char was my Ranger in the 50ties,victims :) were anacondas in JPF.
Every single time I used the WMBS my health bar dropped faster than
the snakes one,with dual wield I won every fight with always more
than 40 % health.
 
Makes me want to cry,every time I see a Warrior with a 2Hander.   :)

Well,on the other hand its easy to get aggro with my ranger
from the warrior main tank.   ;)
