i would like to suggest

"Gainward GeForce 3 Ti 200"

if you are looking for a GF3.

it has faster ram (4.0ns) than any other GF3Ti200s
its clocked at faster default speeds than other GF3Ti200s
and with the faster ram, heatsinks mounted on the ram, you can actually
clock it to near GeForce3Ti500 speeds.... and a GF3Ti500 generally costs a
lot more.

www.newegg.com has both the 64meg and 128meg versions cheap. $133 SHIPPED
for the 64meg version, etc..


and I would like to second the notion of getting the GeForce 4 Ti 4200 later
this month/earlier next. it will be the best thing then. the Gainward GF3Ti
200 is the best thing now. (and maybe in a month or two, the Gainward
GeForce 4 Ti 4200 will be the best thing)
