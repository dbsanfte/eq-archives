What do you say when someone inspects you?  I don't know how many times I
have accidentally inspected people at the bank/merchants.  If you consider
this rude because you roleplay I understand, and would expect a saying such
as "How dare you inspect the great and prosperous *insert your name here*
may you only envy the ground I walk upon and not my items."  (please don't
steal my quote:) Do you say such a roleplaying response each time you are
inspected?  If not do you just blow up ranting and raging?  or do you just
walk away and ask them not to inspect them?

This is a respond to everyone that thinks inspecting is rude.  So let me
know how you handle these rude situations, and why it is considered rude.

Thanks!  The not so great and prosperous,
