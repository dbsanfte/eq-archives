Can't answer this one specifically, but with most laptop vid drivers
you get the option to tell it if you want it to fill the screen or
not.

Hasn't ever been for me.

No clue.

External!!

I spent a lot of time on the road with my trusty Tecra 8100 (PIII 750,
XGA 14.1", 384mb ram with a S3 Savage 8mb(?) 3d card).  It played
pre-SoL EQ just wonderfully.  Post-SoL (which wasn't installed, but
had to get DX8.1, etc) it struggles a bit, but with the sky turned off
and some minor tweaking it works just fine.  For that kind of machine
your looking at (I'm guessing Dell 8100?) I doubt you'll have any
issues.

The ONE positive fallout from 9/11 is now that I'm laid off, no longer
a road warrior.  *sigh*  I guess that's good, right?
