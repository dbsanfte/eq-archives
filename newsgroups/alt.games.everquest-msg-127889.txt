    Yes, we have. Repeatedly. This guy has also griefed others on the
server, most recently stealing the Broodmother from some poor guy doing his
Kromrif Military Leggings quest. But he just can't be pinned down, and the
switch to a wandering GM hasn't helped. When he first ninja'ed the AoW, he
passed the legs back and forth between his accounts, each time claiming he'd
been duped by the previous character to hold the legs. He then washed their
trade history by selling them to a vendor and buying them back with someone
else. If he hadn't been so stupid as to continue to try and /auction them,
we'd have never caught him. And it took the server GM a week of dedicated
tracing to find the legs - but even then, the "I was duped by the last guy"
excuse was good enough to get him off (and selling the legs to the vendor
washed all traces of which account had actually ninja'ed the legs in the
first place).

    Fast forward to now. Remember I mentioned that a guildmate had tried to
talk to this weasel on AIM, and had his hard drive hacked during the
conversation? Well, the weasel got the guildmate's EZBoard password from
that. The guildmate is an officer. So he got into our EZBoard, then created
an officer EZBoard account for himself, and copied the entire "real life"
section where some members had their names, addresses, and phone numbers. He
trashed the boards so people couldn't talk and warn others, then phoned a
few people and pretended to be the officer whose hard drive he hacked. He
managed to get three people to give him their userid/password "so I can log
you in and finish your Emperor key today" (he could check who had theirs
with our Magelo section). One person he stripped of droppables, then started
very publically delevelling to distract us from the other two. The second
got hold of a GM just in time - he found most of the droppables from the
first on one of his alts, just about to be handed off, and wasn't touched.
The third one hadn't been very active recently, and was just about to go on
vacation (which he told the hacker). The hacker quietly /guildremoved that
one, stripped his droppables (including the gnome mask), spent all his
banked AA points, then started playing him and telling everyone that he'd
grown tired of our guild and left. By the time we got him back from the
hacker, he was wrecked - and the wandering GM, not willing to do the
background check we asked him to do to see that this guy was a real ongoing
problem, said he wouldn't restore any of the items to either guildmate. (The
one that had been delevelled had various items left on the corpses. When he
was given control of the account back, the account was also suspended one
week pending investigation. So all the corpses, and the items on them,
poofed.)

    When confronted in-game, as I've mentioned, the hacker has an excuse for
all occasions. While passing the ninja'ed loot, he was "duped by the last
guy" or "just holding/auctioning for a friend". The gnome mask he apparently
got by trading for it on Legends, then moving it here (despite his starting
to auction it the same day as our guildmate had his stolen). The two
characters he had jump the Broodmother? One only did it "for the faction"
while the other said he'd ALWAYS had Kromrif Leggings (as he put them on
right after the killing). He's also been involved in a couple of Lodizal
incidents during a brief period when he was guilded with a brand new guild,
where he looted stuff "that was about to rot" or which had been "promised to
him" by people who couldn't remember doing any such thing. He's claimed to
be the original owner of each of the E-Bay accounts he has to gain
info/access/lewts (even when everyone knows he's not), and moved two of his
accounts to Legends and back - and changed the names on them when they moved
back.

    What we need is ONE GM to take the time to investigate this parasite and
remove him from EQ entirely. We have logs of conversations with him, we have
a history of where he's moved stuff (he's too arrogant to NOT auction the
stuff after he moves it), we can demonstrate that each of the accounts he
holds (that we know about) was sold on Playerauctions, we have a laundry
list of people he's screwed over in our guild and in others - but we can't
get a GM to take the time to nail this little creep and push him back under
the rock he crawled out from.
