	Aye, pretty unimaginitive stuff so far.

	Basically, because as an SK I've made a living out of making every tiny 
little advantage I can get add up to something significant. I'll get the 
tankers cos they're there, and then if I can possibly consider getting 
further AA's without actually vomiting blood, I will get some 
interesting/fun ones.

	In a raiding guild, another 5% tanking is a buttload more important 
than clicky invis or upping my feign-pulling ability. (although these 
will rock for grouping)

Cheers,
James
