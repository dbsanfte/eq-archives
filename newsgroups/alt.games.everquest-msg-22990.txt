I have a similar problem with a TNT2 card. All other games and applications
work fine. I reinstalled EQ, video drivers, sound drivers, went back to
DirectX 7, and now back to Direct X 8, and I still haven't found a total
cure.

Have you got the latest Detonator drivers? They may help.

If you find a cure, could you post it?
