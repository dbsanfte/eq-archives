Any system like this that relies on the players is wide open to abuse.

For example, <Uber Guild> could get all of its members to favorably rate
each other, getting a massive reputation increase.

Or they could all decrease the reputation of anyone they decided they didn't
like.

Or you could get someone creating a new character just to increase the rep
of their friends.

Or you could get someone with a bad rep giving plat to newbies for rep
increases.
