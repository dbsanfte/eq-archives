But it's no drop, as you say, so the potter can only make it for herself.
Fortunately, pottery is easy to learn and the components are available
with just a little camping, so there's no reason non-casters over L40 or

There's also a Lizard Blood Potion, dropped in Cazic Thule.  It takes
you to the wizzy spire in CT.
