Another one - they've reverted to the same original zone layout but 
updated the graphics since so many players complained about the 
play-school version of Nektulos.

That's their aim - so that people who die in the tutorial pay a small 
price, rather than using it as a way of getting back to their bind point.

Outdoor HoT zones probably have better ZEM's than similar level indoor 
zones.
