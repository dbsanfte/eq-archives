When you updated to the Voodoo 5 how did you do it?

When you change video cards, you should do the following:

* Uninstall old vidro drivers
* Set current video card to Standard SVGA card (640x480, 16 colour)
* Power down, restart to make sure this has taken and it doesn't just
reinstall the old card with drivers still on the disk.
* Power down, swap cards over
* Install NVidia drivers from the Nvdia side 23.11 i think are the latest &
best
* Reinstall DirectX 8.1
* Try EQ now.
