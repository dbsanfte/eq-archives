Of course, I have not fought the warders (I assume you have) but I was
under the impression that primal still drops, etc. and the only things
lost were a couple of Warder specific items that weren't exactly
"balance altering". You may have to work harder or wait longer for your
primal, but it's there. (Unless i heard incorrectly.) How is the zone
"useless"?

More on this below, but let's stop for a moment and consider who it is
you are lashing out at... the Uberguild who wakes the Sleeper, or
Verant?

I think it could be done extensively and still not *force* people into
the Oasis LoIM, OT, DL cycle. They do it because it's easy. Lot's of
other low level content out there.

Now to the point. Who exactly are you blaming? If you are posting an
opinion about how Verant implemented the only content (at the time)
where the players could make a permanent effect on the world, then fine.
Opinions always welcome, and it's a valid point of discussion here. I
also think there's other, better ways such sweeping changes could be
installed. But take a look at the topic line again. We're talking about
content that's already in the game. Verant put the ST zone into the game
in the way it is now. The warders can (if you are uber enough to fucking
pull it off) be killed. And they have a special loot table. Hence, I
conclude that VI *intended* for them to be killed. In fact, if you dig
back in your memory to the Conquest fiasco, VI actually *STATED* (and in
fact, I think it was Brad who posted it to the developers boards) that
[paraphrased] 'We encourage people to keep trying to wake the Sleeper.
We just don't want it done using exploits,' etc.

Now, the Sleeper himself, I'm willing to bet he doesn't even HAVE a loot
table. Why? Wasn't intended to be killed, IMHO. But what he *does* have
is a huge, complex script written for when he's awoken. (buggy though it
may be in some cases.) This *ALSO* tells me that he was "intended" to be
awoken in The Vision (tm).

Take all that and ask yourself.... there's the biggest brass ring in the
whole fucking game hanging there, and you finally got your carousel pony
close enough to try to grab it. Your'e not going to? 

Sorry, but to steal a recent, and wonderful, phrase from Lannella here,
I have to call "excessive boohooism" on your part. The people who hate
the guilds who wake the sleeper are the ones who didn't get to do it.
Also lot's of the 95% of the player base who will never, EVER, get to
the point of even getting keys to ST, say nothing of fighting Ventani
with a chance to win. If you think that waking the sleeper hurts the
game, blame Verant. Not the guild who manages to wake him.

See above. Biggest brass ring, etc. etc.  Sureyly you can't be serious.

You're usually far more of a realist than that, James. Since when has
*any* group of players "shown" Verant anything?

See? Now we're back to opinions about better ways to implement such
world changing content. And I agree with you. None of this, however,
impacts the fact that the Sleeper is already *IN* the game, *AS IS* and
big guilds are simply doing exactly what VI intended them to do in The
Vision.

Bullhockey and excessive boohooism again. Too competitive? Sure. But
that doesn't apply here. How about your guild or friends' guilds that
you raid with, etc.? If you were the last one to gank a particular first
brood dragon, and after a patch you wander by and that dragon's up, let
me guess.... you all start sending tells to other guilds capable of
taking him to make sure they have a fair chance at it, and you sit there
on your hands and guard it until they get their raid force there an hour
later, right? Not likely. You compete. You take what you can get. The
bigger the prize the better. Fact of end game life. This was just the
biggest prize in the game, and moreso because it was only awarded once.

Going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're actually
serious. I guess I can see why you're unguilded. You must hate
competition of any sort. I would suggest this game may be not very well
suited to you. There's lots of competition in it. But unless you can
tell me that you would *never* race another guild to get a big dragon,
or Tormax, etc. etc. when they spawn, then I say your statement is the
moral posturing and boohooism of somebody who didnt' get to Ventari
first.
