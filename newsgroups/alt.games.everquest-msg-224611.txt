RTS a la Warcraft, StarCraft, and Command & Conquer. Not a bad genre, in 
its way.

And to address Moorguards comments about it being like a movie trailor:

Putting a fancy trailer in front of another movie entices people who go 
see the movie to see the movie being previewed. I have no issue with 
good old fasioned advertising.

However, I think the greater perceived 'value' here is the eq2 beta... 
so much so that I cynically beleive they're selling eq2 beta slots and 
giving you a free copy of an RTS (one that is getting lacklustre 
enthusiasm from the RTS community, and is a non-event to the EQ 
community.) So to boost the RTS sales they're bundling it with an EQ2 
beta slot and pushing it to the EQ community.

In other words: they aren't trying to entice the RTS crowd to try EQ2... 
they're trying to get the EQ crowd to buy their crummy RTS by bundling 
it with an EQ2 beta account.

In the movie analogy, this would have people paying 12.50 to see the 
trailer, and possibly walk out before the actual movie starts, this 
pretty much doesn't happen. In contrast, I wouldn't be surprised if the 
majority of LoE boxes they move with this bundle don't ever even get 
installed, never mind played to completion.
