I mourn the days before anime was as popular as it is now, and
japanophiles, as they call them, were a rarity rather than an
annoyance to many. A lot of my old loves that I was viewed as a geek
for eventually became popular... Dressing in black, goodwill clothes,
anime/manga, roleplaying, computers, internet... I wasn't a geek, I
was ahead of my time!

While it pains me to see these things become mainstream to the point
of over-saturation, it does great things for the
technologies/industries involved in some of those cases. Anime's much
more accessable and affordable now, and gaming technology has improved
majorly thanks to the rises in popularity. Guess I gotta take the bad
with the good.
