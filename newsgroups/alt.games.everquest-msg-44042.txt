That is in two years, whereas previously you were saying that in 3 to 6 months
Win9x drivers would be phased out:

Which is a crock. Windows 98 is already 3 years old, so of course development of
drivers for an operating system that has been superceded twice is going to drop
off by the time 5 years has passed, but your timeline keeps switching frames, and
your packet loss is quite evident.
