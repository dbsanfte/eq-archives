I have used it...I usually dont.  Normally I have a monk pulling.

I dont run at all while I am being pounded by mobs, unless my wife asks me
to move some so she can spread out the mobs a bit with mes.  I have also
used fear and entill and then atone for a ghetto mez.  We are a very
versatile class when it comes to what we offer a group, and great having
your input on it BTW.  Nice to have a non-flame discussion about it  :)
