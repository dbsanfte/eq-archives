No, no.  Because you're a self-absorbed twit who cares only for his
own convenience.  Please try to keep up.

Hmmm, so your basic problem is inability to think coherently?  Your
rather anemic attempted flame was nothing more than a whiny complaint
with a bit of name-calling tossed in.

Others are so absorbed with themselves they can scarcely utter
or type a word without making some sort of pathetic attempt at
self-justification, usually in the form of a juvenile attack on
whoever they think is trying to restrict their fun.  Your choice
of insults alone gives away your sad little game.  You start off
calling Bebinn a prude?  Gimme a break, calling somebody a prude
is, to borrow a phrase, the last refuge of the irresponsible.
