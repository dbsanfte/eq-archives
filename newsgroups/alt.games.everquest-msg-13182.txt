    When I went in for my spells, I remember two warrior-looking fellows
inside of Third Gate, between the cleric guild and the library, that were
dubious to my had-only-killed-a-few-Orc Pawns High Elf. Only dubious mobs I
saw, so they may be on IB faction. It would be easy enough to Invis past
that short run, though, with illusion DE still up.
