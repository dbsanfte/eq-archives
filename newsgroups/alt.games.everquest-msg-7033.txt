Yes they are.  Seen em charmed by a druid at any rate...
never seen em feared but then who would?

My last cleric used to hunt the RyGorr oracle there at
the GD Bridge (since nerfed, I hear) and saw many a
heavily buffed up snow bunny pet sent in as "lead"

If charm broke noone cared, since a snow bunny hits
people in their 40s rarely and for a max of 2 points
damage...

On the other hand resists are low on a critter that size,
charm sticks for a good long time, and the life expectency
of a snow bunny attacking the RyGorr is low even if
it does have over 600 hp!  Sucked up the intitial attack
and spell casting frenzy while we got snare and fear stuck
onto the target... oddly snow bunnies often -did- survive,
as long as our spells stuck fairly quickly.  Ah, Fluffy VI,
that was some bunny, think he helped kill 5 level 45 to 50
mobs in a row before he died in an unfortunate riposte incedent
while temporarily off charm.

Never in my EQ life have I laughed so hard, that's the
only problem with this tactic!  Hard to fight sometimes
when you can barely stay in your chair.
