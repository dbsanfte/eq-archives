i think it would be nice to have a /react command.
basically for making macros.
the main use would be if you were medding or sitting and healing and you
wanted to go afk and not worry about being caught of guard.
example macro (just started learning to use them so if a few commands are
wrong cut me some slack.)
first target yourself
/react %target = stand on
/(don't know the command for this but i want target nearest enemy here)
/attack on

the macro wouldn't start until the /react command was true.
so you could leave and if a creature came by and started wailing on you the
react macro would have you attack back until you've returned to finish him
off.
it would have to be an on and off switch though.
i can see forgetting you have it on then standing as a guard walks
by.....whoops your dead.
just an idea i had.
