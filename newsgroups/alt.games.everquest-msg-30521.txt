As  has been said before, a good group in an area where there are MANY
spawns a good group far outperform a solo player. Druids in particular
may be the only exception. Trading clarity for sow with a friendly
enchanter while QUAD kiting is spooky experience for a druid. Wizzies
also can do this if they find an area where enough mobs spawn of the
appropriate type.

I myself have been a quad kiting druid (high end warrior now). Only
one thing to say.... Whats the point? It's a game, grouping and
experiencing all you can is (IMHO) what the game is about. Sure you
can  level as fast as possible, and get to the point where you CAN
perform a role in a Place like Temple of Veeeshan. But if you are a
druid who is going to have you? Don't forget every guild has tons of
druids. And most times they have little use for other classes who solo
often.

The high end game, where most of us either retire or spend ALL our
time raiding is about grouping experience. If you don't have it, you
will be at a major disadvantage.
