OK, let's imagine this setup.  Three characters on an account.  1 and 2 each
have one of a particular LORE item.  3 does not.  What happens in these
cases?

Experiment #1.

Put item from Char 1 in the shared bank.  Switch to Char 2.  I assume that
Char 2 cannot take the item out of the bank.  However, what about opening
the bag its in?

Experiment #2.

Put item from Char 1 in the shared bank.  Switch to Char 2.  Can 2 put the
item in the shared bank, so there are two of them there?

Experiment #3.

Put item from Char 1 in the shared bank.  Can Char 1 then acquire another
one of those items?  E.g., does the one in the shared bank no longer count
against 1?  If it doesn't count, can 1 put another in there, and another?
