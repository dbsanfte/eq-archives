That's not the case at all. Its just the normal price of 15 plat vs. his
price of 70 plat is a big difference for something that takes only a few
minutes to do. Mana IS important to a caster while soloing or grouping. When
he said he was camping something, I never kept asking him to do it for me.
Yet he is level 50 something casting a level 29 spell correct? How much mana
does it take then?

I could of asked for camo/invis 24/7 so I could get to the docks. I was in
the WC area for a few weeks trying to get some druid or wizard to port me.
If its more then 15 plat I refuse it. I dont spam every single time my /ooc
goes off from view, I normally just ask in tells if there is less then 5
druids/wizards there. A lot of people wont do  it for free anymore they
throw a big sissy fit over mana that they regen at what 3 times the speed of
HP? There is a diffrence with the mana and hp example you gave, running out
of mana doesn't make every durn mob aggro you (that will normally leave you
alone), nor are you KOed and unable to do ANYTHING.
