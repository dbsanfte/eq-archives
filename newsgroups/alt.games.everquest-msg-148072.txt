VI says, go forth and kill NPC's of equal and higher cons to get even more
experience.
We go forth and kill the NPC's in DSP, like the ones that sit near the
rockhopper caves.
MMM, great experience since they are 60 or higher.
VI, says whoa you can  not get experience that way, we mean to timesink you

overnight.
