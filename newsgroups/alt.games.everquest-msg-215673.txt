Nope, faction is great in all cases. The one in Erudin wouldn't talk
to my Enchanter - she wouldn't talk to some other guy who was there
also. The voice never told my Dwarf who to see. Logged in with my
Human Warrior and went to freeport. The voice told me who to see and
where and everything worked great. The others, I had to take to WK.

I think the Erudin and Kaladim guys are bugged. Has anyone gotten
either one to work?
