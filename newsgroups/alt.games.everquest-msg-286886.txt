Here�s a sneak peek at the Update Notes for Wednesday morning�s Game Update:

*** Highlights ***

- Legends of Norrath: Legends of Norrath: Oathbound is now live!

Legends of Norrath is an online-only trading card game, based on the 
richly-detailed sword-and-sorcery world of Norrath from the massively 
multiplayer online role-playing games EverQuest and EverQuest II. EQ and 
EQII players have been awarded a complimentary random Oathbound digital 
starter deck. To play, navigate the EQ icon to Legends of Norrath or 
simply type /TCG.  Visit http://legendsofnorrath.station.sony.com for 
more information.

- Claim Window: A new window has been added for /claim subscription 
rewards. When the command is used, a UI window will popup.

- The EverQuest window can now be sized by simply dragging the border on 
the window!


*** Items ***

- The Fan Faire item, Stones of Fortune, can now be claimed.
- The Discordant Seal of Health has had its focus changed to one that is 
more appropriate.  Since this is a slight downgrade, if you feel you no 
longer want this, Go to Caerlyna in the bazaar and give her the 
Discordant Seal of Health and she will give you an Ambleshift's Amazing 
Automated Amalgamator with the parts used to make it inside, and you can 
do whatever you wish with the parts. **Be sure you have a bag spot 
available**
- Changed the icon and in-game representation of the following items. 
For the ones that can be pickup up as a ground spawn, this will change 
how they look on the ground: Tomato, Green Apple, Straight Oak Treant 
Branch, Dry Treant Branch, Straight Treant Branch, Fallen Straight Oak 
Treant Branch, Fallen Dry Treant Branch, Fallen Straight Treant Branch, 
Windwillow Branch, Fallen Rotwood Treant Branch, Fallen Windwillow 
Treant Branch, and Fallen Grovewalker Treant Branch.
- Corrected the spelling of the Eminent Impression Book.
- Made Gothic Ringmail usable by Drakkin.
- Corrected stats on Expert Crafted Gloves of the Attackers.
- Removed an erroneous augment slot from the Hand of Glory.
- Shadowknights can now use the Gloomsteel Blade.
- Corrected an issue with several Depths of Darkhollow skills that could 
not be learned by right-clicking.
- Corrected the required level on the Fabled Crystallized Shadow Tunic.
- Corrected the required casting level on Sphere of Air's effect.
- Certain clickable items from Veeshan's Peak have their recast times 
reduced.
- Changed the "Pained Memories" spell to use consuming thickener.
- Removed augments that fit into multiple socket types from type 3 sockets.
- All silk armor usable by pure caster classes will now have a graphic 
if it previously didn't.
- The Last Blood, Bazu Stone, Discordant Stone, and Chronal Stone have 
all had their lore flag removed.


*** Quests & Events ***

- Xanuusus is now a little more informative about his vague poem.


*** Spells ***

- Sea Snake Venom is now curable with effects that remove poison counters.
- Modified the Frenzied Devastation and Prolonged Destruction AAs. Mana 
preservation effects should again reduce the mana cost of using these 
AAs although now the mana cost will be variable instead of fixed (but 
should average out to the same cost.) Additionally the increased mana 
cost should only apply to direct damage spells and the ability is 
limited to a set number of casts with a longer duration rather than a 
short period of time as before.


*** NPC ***

- The Casino operator will now make sure you do not have the Vibrating 
Gauntlets of Infuse and the Vibrating Hammer before awarding you that item.
- Fixed a bug preventing the door into the Shade King's room in 
Frostcrypt from opening.
- Guards in Commonlands will now attack pumas and lions. Not only will 
this make the area a bit safer, but it should also improve the spider 
population a bit for those seeking their silk.
- Summoned pets for both players and NPCs will now appear at a certain 
range in front of the player. Pets should no longer spawn on top of 
their master.


*** AA ***

- Increased the hitpoints of the swarm pets summoned by ranks 4 and 5 of 
the Shaman AA Spirit Call so that the swarm pets from rank 4 would not 
be killed faster than the swarm pets from rank 3.
- Removed the AA "Frenzied Defense" while we continue to investigate 
issues with this ability.


*** Zones ***

- Re-enabled Manastone usage in the following revamped zones: Lavastorm, 
West Freeport, East Freeport, North Desert of Ro, and South Desert of Ro.


*** UI ***

- New -

EQUI_ClaimWnd.xml

- Changed -

EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml
EQUI_VideoModesWnd.xml
EQUI_AAWindow.xml
EQUI_BarterSearchWnd.xml
EQUI_BarterWnd.xml
EQUI_Inventory.xml

EQUI_TCGStartupWnd.xml
EQUI.xml


*** Miscellaneous ***

- We fixed a number of issues with Legends of Norrath within EverQuest.
- Fixed a problem with transformation molds where items transformed 
could not be linked in the chat window.
- Weapon procs will now only fire on the player's main target.
- You now need to be in full screen mode to change your resolution size 
under the options menu.  While in windowed mode, you can simply drag the 
window border to resize the window.
