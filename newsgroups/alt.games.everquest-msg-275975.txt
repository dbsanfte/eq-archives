I think that was their intent from the beginning.

Putting the barter zone into a completely separate area also allows
them to keep the new barter code separate from the bazaar code. If
something went seriously wrong with the barter zone and buyers launch,
by keeping it separate, they don't bring down the bazaar at the same
time while they work on code fixes. In the month since launch, I don't
think I've heard of any serious bugs being found in the barter zone, so
there should not be any serious bugs in the bazaar after they combine
the two :).
