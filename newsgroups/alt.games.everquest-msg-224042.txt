I discovered recently that a family I knew well in highschool all play,
but on a different server than I do.  They're pretty happy there - they're
in a good guild that suits their playstyle and available time.  

If, for any reason, I suddenly didn't want to play on Lanys, I'd want to
play with them.  At a time like that, $75 would seem like very little to
bring my mage over with his 65 levels, 40aa and several pieces of decent
gear.
