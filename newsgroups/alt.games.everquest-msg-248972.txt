I've been completely unable to get past the patcher since yesterday.  Ok 
there is a big honking patch out but in addition to that I haven't been 
able to connect to http://eqlive.station.sony.com/ either.  Funny thing is 
that the regular sony station site http://www.station.sony.com/en/ comes 
right up.  Anyone else having problems?
