Why do the stupidest whiners so often preface their bitching and moaning
with the highly unoriginal "let me see if I have this straight" expression?
Together with the clumsy renditions of "the pot calling the kettle black,"
unimaginitive Usenet goons seem to be equipped with all the colorful
expressions their puny intellects will handle.

If you ever want to impress people, A Bag Of (nice job, capitalizing the
preposition there) Memes -- and I'll bet you do -- I suggest you stick with
crushing beer cans on your prodigious forehead, because your imagination
isn't ever going to get the job done.
