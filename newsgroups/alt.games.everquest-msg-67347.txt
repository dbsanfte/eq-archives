Who else here keeps getting this same message whenever you send in a bug
report? I feel as if my reports are not even getting looked at. There is
still no mention of any fix for ATI cards and Soundblaster Live. Two of the
most popular cards around... well top 20 anyway.

"We are currently aware of the Installation and Technical problems that
are occurring with the new Shadows of Luclin expansion and the update to
the existing EverQuest game client. Listed below are some fixes for most
of the installation and technical problems. If you are still having
problems, after following all of these steps, please refer to the bottom
of the page, where it has detailed instructions on the files that we
require to further troubleshoot your problem."
