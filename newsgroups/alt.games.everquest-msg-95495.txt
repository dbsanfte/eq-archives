   (Veering wildly off-topic) Doesn't matter. I live in NC now, and
invariably when I get stuck behind a complete idiot, sure enough,
Pennsylvania plates. It was pretty spooky for a while, but now I just accept
it as one of those strange but true things (Like how you can tune in a
country radio station that's broadcasting from 3 states away, but when your
favorite song comes on the radio station down the block gets taken out by a
solar flare or something)
