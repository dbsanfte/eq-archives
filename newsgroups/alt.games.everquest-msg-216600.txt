They do not document everything they patch when they patch it.

The only reason they do ex post facto is to stop all the bitching.

I have to learn how to pull that place, yes. It helps to know where mobs 
aggro through walls, where pathing guarantees an add, the safest and best 
way to break the spawn, etc.

The risk is in the inherent chaos involved in a system of this complexity.

I suppose you've ignored the reports of laying waste to EVERY mob in the 
zone and still falling short of the goal?

Buh bye, you have been disbanded. Any monk pulls that shit with me, they 
can go solo. Any group member period.

Why do you think the monk should? The cleric has a better knowledge of the 
requirements to keep everyone alive and kicking.

By "realize what they're actually capable of" I assume you mean "get 
frustrated trying to give me a clue".

Yes, I do this. I fail to see how this is indicative of whether or not the 
cleric can take another pull. I do this at 80m, I do it at 20m, I do it at 
2m.

In most situations this is fine, and is typically what I do as well. In 
fights where the mid-fight cheal is a must, I prefer to cut it fairly 
close, leaving only 15-20% on the tank when it finally hits. That way the 
mob is that much closer to dying, and I can top the tank off after with a 
cele or something if I am lucky.

HP disparity = less efficient cheals = more mana spent.

Well, I speak from the seat of a 50 cleric, so my 20m is very different. A 
cheal for me, for example, is 13m.

What the fuck are you babbling about?

What I orginally said was that there could be situations where the mage 
would be the best choice of a puller. Run speed buffs and level disparity 
are two of those cases.

I will be sure to mention that to the next tell I get in a pickup group of 
"You are one of the best clerics I have ever grouped with".

I understand maximizing mana regen- I bought a steed for that and put in a 
6 second UI timer. I am saying that is not enough sometimes, and once the 
mob comes in you have x+y total mana, where x is what you had and y is what 
you can gain back mid fight. y is generally limited, so it is best to have 
ample x to make sure you have z, where z is the amount needed for everyone 
to survive.

I have never heard anyone call this "body language". /rude, now that is 
body language. 

I med every second I am not casting, running, or avoiding sit aggro.

Hell, I frequently run ("OK all move up") in 5 second bursts. I loot like 
that too.

Yeah, whatever.

No, that's one CH and a cele. Please stop assuming everyone is 65 in uber 
gear.
