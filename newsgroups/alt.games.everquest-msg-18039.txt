Unfair comparison. Same sort of deal in EQ:

NPC: "Are you interested in undertaking a [quest] for the [ubersword] of
mobslicing?"

PC: "I will quest for the ubersword."
PC: "I will undertake a quest for the ubersword."
PC: "What quest for the ubersword?"
PC: "I am interested in undertaking a quest for the ubersword of
mobslicing."
PC: "What quest for the ubersword of mobslicing?"

PC: "Ah, screw it!"
