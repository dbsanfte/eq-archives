the fact is that my enchanter needs the extra spell slots.  I'm sick of the
micromanagement of my enchanter, and I'm sick of having to swap out spells.
I don't know how many other dead issues turned around to have Verant decide
it was doable, but this is an issue as long as Ermin is around, and I won't
let it go.  I'll be pushing it in Verant's face as adamantly as here, pretty
shortly.

To not start the argument with DAOC isn't better in regards to spell casting
because they allow you more spell slots, shows EQ is lacking in design with
regard to this one point.   let me repeat, EQ IS LACKING!!!

if you think your not better off for things being faster, perhaps you should
become ahmish.  And if you see an Ahmish using a car, they aren't ahmish!!!

Their auction system is currently being updated, because its outdated.  Its
just a question of when the spell system will be updated.

you have 475 K users giving them close to $5 mil + a year now, you can hope
they could keep current among the MMORPG's.

If not, eventually people will jump ship.  Case in point is when I had GM's
in GEMSTONE 3 argue with me about how I should role-play my char and telling
me what I should do instead of blasting  others with the only effective
spell I had 417 - earthquake type spell that could kill.  I had higher
levels thinking it was funny to chastise me by sleeping me.  Effectively
them being higher level meant I had no other recourse except a direct attack
that could kill.  Essentially I don't have the patience for not being able
to play in a game where I'm paying for.  I also don't have patience when it
comes to NEEDLESS micromanagement.  I usually flat out warned people after
they slept me that I would blast them next time they did.  I let everyone
know that I would do this.  This was also after I slept someone lower than
me and they turned around to blast me.  If anyone is interested, I have a
500 K file that displays my last days in Gemstone 3.   If I ever got even
slightly chastised in EQ like I did in Gemstone 3, like being locked in a
cell for even a few hours, those would be my last days in EQ.

I'm going to get to a point where I'm sick of all the current games, and
make a meta game that encompasses them all.  It'll also effectively bypass
all licences and what not, because the game won't be based on any specific
game or title, other than actual experience people have shared from their
games / movies / true life experiences.
It also will allow you to speak OOC and in game in one voice, because it is
a meta - game.  Probably a few years after City of Heroes, Horizons, and
Star Wars Galaxies.
Also interested in having the game be playable in any form.  Whether in
usenet group discussions, RPG form, email, etc.  any form where you have
interaction between participants.  I'm also believe this is the only game
that could have drastic effects on real world situations.  I won't go into
any specific details at this time, maybe in a few years when I hone it
better.  I guess some people wouldn't consider it a game if it had real
world implications.
