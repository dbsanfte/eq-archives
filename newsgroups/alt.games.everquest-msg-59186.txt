Actually I think I know what might have happened, you probably got
attacked by a bear at the same time.  If you get attacked by an animal
at the druid rings in NK, you best hope you are a cleric with divine
aura and a sow up when it happens.  The druids take offense to you
attacking animals, even if you don't attack at all.  Always with bears
and wolves, hit or miss with anything else.  
Most likely the animal aggroed on you at/near the same time, and with
the "surprise" attack by the druids, you missed the battle spam of the
animal attack.

I ported someone there and got killed by Grimfeather, so the NK ring is
not exactly "safe".
