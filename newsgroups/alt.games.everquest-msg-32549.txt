Things can see you. They will not however, go aggro on you if you are
behind them. A successful sneak + hide together will give you Rogue
invisibility, which works on both living and unliving things at the same
time.

Hide does go up eventually. Remember that it's a racial skill for dark
elves, and starts at a skill level of 50 or so, higher than possible to
attain at level 1. Past 100 skill, you'll never fail to hide. Same with
sneak. There are mobs that can see invis (Well, more like X-ray vision,
considering you're not suppose to be in plain sight), or have a chance
of being spawned able to see you depending on your level (Though you'll
mainly have to worry about that 50+).

>- will I be KoS to anybody in East Commons?  

I think there are one or two Dudley Do-Rights about in EC, but they
won't be a problem unless you go poking about unhidden. Killing orcs as
often as you see them will set you straight though.

Hey slick...

Just in case you don't know and for the benefit of those reading: Sneak
behind a mercantile NPC. Then right-click to bring up the Merchant
window. When you've concluded your business, rehide and move away, still
sneaking. You can do this to any NPC merchant, and it's safe too [1].
Using this technique (But unhiding before you hand stuff in) is an
excellent way of handing in faction boosting quest items whilst deadly,
deadly KOS. You'll find travelling around stealthed slow though.

[1] OK, there was this one time I tried to buy the paper from the new
high elf seller and got attacked by the guards facing in my direction
nearby, but for the most part, you will largely be safe when it comes to
using NPC merchants. It sets your faction to dead-indifferent, so have
you charisma above 103 if you want the best prices.
