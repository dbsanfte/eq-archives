Ummm, actually, no, Mesmer is an obscure figure in history compared to
Freud.  I just did an Amazon search on both Mesmer and Freud.  I got 1
DVD, 39 books, and 101 results in zShops for Mesmer.  I got 11222
results in zShops, 1614 results in books, 6 in video, and over 1500 in
tools and hardward (ok, it's possible that this is referring to
another Freud, maybe Anna was a construction worker putting herself
through college).  
Would you petition Tesla or Farnsworth?  Both are probably much more
well known than Mesmer.

Arolpin
sure that someone, somewhere knows that I stole this name
