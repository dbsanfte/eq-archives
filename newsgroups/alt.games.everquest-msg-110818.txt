I'm still unable to find those files.
I've got the newest (actually was same version I had before) version of
EQInside from HackersQuest.com
Can you give me an example of a file that contains the XMI files? And are
you using EQInside to extract it?
When I use EQInside all I see is *.bmp *.wld *.wav files in those other
*.s3d files.
Also, I try to look at the spells and get "Invalid spelldat.eff file."
error.
