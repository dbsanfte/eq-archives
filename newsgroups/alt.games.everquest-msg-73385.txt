Ok, I'm just going to say in advance that I'm not refering specifically to
the fungi tunic (in which it seems that people made assumptions based on
info that Verant said up front would be subject to change), but rather to
nerfing in general.

So, the fact that they were cheated 7K is alright because they have more.
Sorry, but I ain't buying that line.  If you're stiffed through no fault of
your own, then you're stiffed, plain and simple.  It really doesn't matter
how little or much you have.

Of course, there's always the possiblity that that bastard shelled out most
of his money for it, or invested a good amount of time to actually earn it.

So, I'm envious that you have 6k in the bank, and I have somewhere around
200pp.  Doesn't mean I think Verant should nerf all your stuff and steal
half your plat.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
