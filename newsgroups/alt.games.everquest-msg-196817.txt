I just don't see that.  Rangers and monks are not sponges.  Not.  In fact I
find the idea of someone using them as damage absorbtion devices as "wrong"
as you do the idea of a shaman doing the job.

Rangers and monks, even untwinked ones, very noticably outdamage me.  Paired
with one I invariably kill mobs more than twice as fast as I do solo.  What
they can't do, unless heavily twinked, is take a lot of hits.  Monks, once
upon a time, -were- good at this job, but thats been more or less nerfed
away.

Shaman, on the other hand, will spend the rest of their carreers solo
tanking and doing tank mez duty in groups; training one to do that job
doesn't strike me as nearly as out of line as training rangers or monks to
get and hold aggro.

Also, since I'm capable of standing up to the beating, the rangers and monks
can take the rogue position on the opposite side of the mob, increasing
their DPS still more; mob no longer dodges, parries, or ripostes their
hits.  If you have to chose between me doing an extra 15% damage or the monk
or ranger, I think its pretty clear who should get the priviledge of hitting
the unprotected side of the mob!
