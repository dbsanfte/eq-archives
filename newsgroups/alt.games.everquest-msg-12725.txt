Well, on servers, I would recommend mine, Tarew Marr, lots of nice people,
not an enormous amount of lamers, except in the usual places (EC, Gfay,
LoIO, Oasis) and if you are in EC and dont want to see people selling stuff,
just turn off auction, OOC and shout, that should be nice and quiet...

People tend to be very nice, especially in terms of gifts, I've been handed
stuff without asking worth 100 or more plat, only once had to pay for a
port, and that was a donation.

On class/race, pick one that appeals to you, if you like beating stuff down,
go with a warrior/monk/rogue, if you like standing back and letting a pet
kill stuff and assisting the pet, go for a magician or necromancer; races I
would recommend one of the good races (unless you choose to be a
necromancer, then you do NOT want to be human, they have a hard time
starting off in my opinion, gnome is a good choice in my opinion); if you
like helping people, be a shaman or cleric; and if you cant play for much
per sitting, be a solo class like a magician, necromancer or druid.
