I have never seen a pet cast these spells before.  The Child of Wind
that I've been using only invizes himself.  Course he does proc a
bunch, stunning, etc.  Never noticed all those other spells.  Is that
only if the pet is augged?  I am a VERY poor mage, in a small guild
and don't even have VT gear (focus) so the 66 pet I use is unfocused.
