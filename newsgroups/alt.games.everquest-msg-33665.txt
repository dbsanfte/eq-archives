Going to start up a warrior to understand what it is like to be on the other
end of a heal spell and thus hopefully become a better cleric in the
process.  My main (and currently only) character is a 34 lvl Halfling
cleric.  After much research, I've decided to start up an ogre warrior (plan
to max my strength, toss five into DEX to raise it to 75 to eliminate the
penalty, and put rest into stamina).

Meanwhile, my real life best friend has been "slightly" bitching about not
being able to group with me.  We started EQ basically at the same time, but
I have advanced in levels a "little" faster than him.  My main is 34 and his
is 14.  Anyway, he suggested just recently that we start up characters that
we only play when we're both online so they advance at the same pace.  He
really doesn't care what he plays as long as we can start off in the same
newbie area.  Well, I'm now thinking that my
"let's-see-what-it's-like-being-a-tank" ogre warrior might just fit the bill
here and I've read here and elsewhere that the Warrior / Shaman duo is a
very effective team.

My only concern stems from what I've read here in this newsgroup about
soloists and duo-ists.  That being you don't learn how to operate in full
groups by going it alone or just with one other thus when you get to the
raid level, you're clueless, it shows, and raid invites don't then come as
fast to you, if at all.  What I'm wondering is if this is true and, if it is
true as a general rule, if it is true for a warrior specifically.  I can see
it being true for a cleric since managing a group of six is far more
demanding than a group of two (self included).  But I'm thinking it might
not be true for a warrior since I'm don't see how I'd play differently
regardless of the group's size.  Well, I could see maybe not pulling deep
reds because of the lack of another tank, but other than that I don't see
how I'd operated differently ... so says the cleric player that has never
played a tank.

What I'm getting at is this: If there isn't any real penalty for a warrior
to duo all the way up then I'll go along with my friend's wishes and it will
just be him and I against the EQ world.  However, if there is a penalty for
not grouping in larger groups, then I'll be advocating to my friend that we
do recruit others to join us in our Sherman's march across Norrath.

If anything, I can see my friend being the one that will hurt himself later
for not grouping with more people as a shaman, but I know my friend and he
really won't care about that.  Me, on the other hand, think that once my
warrior gets my friend's shaman up to a level that if my warrior was 60th
level, my friend's shaman can still group and get XP with him, I'll then
start playing the warrior more often and not just when my friend is online.
Hmmmm.  How low can a shaman be and still group and get XP with a 60th lvl
warrior?

Thoughts?  Comments?  Suggestions?
