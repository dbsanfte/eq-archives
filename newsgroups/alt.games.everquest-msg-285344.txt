I'll give you the first part; I too tend to think of "tag" as meaning
taking initial aggro.  Of course, that's BECAUSE my thinking is based
on EQ's "rules", which are enforced (to the extent they are) by social
convention and not by the game.  Apparently in WOW the game makes a
distinction based on who does the first actual damage, and thus it is
necessary to have a word to refer to that, and people in WOW apparently
use "tag" to mean this.  /shrug

You did blur the issue by the wording in your original remark:

>>>>>> Come to WOW, once the mob is tagged its yours.

You made it sound like you thought it was being "out dps'ed" that stole
the mobs from you.  But it's not that the person was doing MORE damage
than you, just that he was getting in the FIRST damage.

To bring this thread back on topic, I'll say that I prefer the EQ way.
Sure, there can be buttheads who break the social rules and KS, as well
as any number of other antisocial behaviors.  But at least when people
do play "by the rules" it allows a greater variety in tactics.  My druid
prefers to pull with snare since that means I have more time to cast any
additional spells.  My wizard, when he pulls, uses a debuffing stick to
keep the aggro low.  And I have a chanter friend who gripes about people
stealing his prey because he starts with something like mez, tash, debuff,
slow, none of which do damage.  Sounds like, if there's an equivalent
class in WOW, people couldn't "KS" him there, but only because the
definition of KS is different there.  People could still steal his prey,
but in WOW they'd be playing by the rules!
