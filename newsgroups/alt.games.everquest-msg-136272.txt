Actually it's more "You MUST specialize in the other casting
disciplines..." because you're limited to 50 in your chosen
field until you train ALL of them.

The safest thing to do is to train all of them and then
simply go somewhere quiet and repeatedly cast your lowest
mana cost spell in that field until it reaches 51.  In most
cases, however, you can simply train all of them and go
play normally.  Unless you're doing something extraordinary
the one that will pass 50 first is the one that you actually
should pick anyway.  Just don't train all of them and play
around with True North for a couple hours...  ;)
