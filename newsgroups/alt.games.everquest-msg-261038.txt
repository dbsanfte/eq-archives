Before the OOW patch, my berserker would use one of his abilities, say 
the stun axe, and that would grey out all three types of abilities, plus 
the abilities to make new axes; similarly, making an axe would grey out 
all the abilites.

Since the patch, though, making axes is on a seperate timer from using 
the axe based abilities.

The abilities themselves still share a timer, if I've just stunned then 
I can't snare till all three ability timers pop back up (a situation 
that comes up with appalling frequency)

But at least if I find I'm out of one axe type, I can use the ability 
for the next axe type, then make new axes, or I can make axes and then 
use ability, either way.

Its not a huge boost, mind you, but it is one, and it hasn't, to my 
knowledge, been mentioned.
