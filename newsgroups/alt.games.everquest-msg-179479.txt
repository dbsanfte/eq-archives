Can't test this to be sure at the moment, but a possibility comes to
mind. At least under the old naming rules (before the current "Any name
is ok except SonyCybers" rules) there was a prohibition against using
"de" as a substitute for "the". (e.g. the name "Bog dekiller" was read
as "Bog the Killer" and was a violation and would be rejected.) They may
have stuck a filter for "de" when found in certain locations (e.g. after
one sylable and before another) into the filter.

Just a thought.
