The current thinking is based around two things SOE have said
which are:

1) EQ2 will be out in 2004
2) EQ2 will have a 3 month beta

Given the state of the game as seen at the Fan Faire, I would bet
that beta is imminent. That means EQ2 beta should start any time
between April and September 04 with release being any time
between August and December.

In the sweepstake, I pick August 16, 5 years and 5 months after
EQ live launched. ;)
