Level One mage summoned pets?  I didn't see any, didn't see any listed on CR
either.  There are L1 Enchanter and Necromancer pets... but thats not the same
thing.

Personally I never did get much damage in meleeing, what I did before getting a
pet was stand toe to toe getting beat on with my attack button on, but really
cycling nuke attempts as fast as I could until I or the mob died or I ran OOM.  I
also died a lot, not a big loss since it refreshed my mana bar for me; the level
1-3 hell for mages is really just as easily 1-3 zerg tactics training.  For a
while after this I continued to tank a good deal of the time, needing to protect
my Fist of Bone improved pet, plus getting Defense skill ups.  But I never did end
up doing anything resembling real damage with my untwinked weapons.  Soon enough I
was walking around with charisma steins in both hands all the time, to save time
vendoring trash loot; no weapon needed since I really couldn't hit for more than
.001 DPS.

Splendid One, 36 Gnomage
