Ahh, yes...

I think it was 3rd Warder in Sleepers Tomb...

A small guild went in with about 18 chars and almost killed the Warder...
Verant expected that encounter to be a 30-40+ char raid.
The guild was using CoH to stop Clerics being summoned into the AE breath
when they collected enough agro from CHing the tanks... something about
CoHing the clerics down to underneath a bridge where the Warder couldn't
follow, and where the z-axis difference made the Warders' AE useless.

Verant argued that it was intentional exploitation of terrain/pathing
The guild argued that because they'd already wiped out, it wasn't a 'sure
thing' exploit... just 'creative tactics'.

Verant invoked 'Rule #1'... "You're in OUR world now!" and disbanded the
guild, suspended everyone taking part, and (if I recall) banned maybe 3
people.

again... terrain/pathing exploitation... warning goes on your record, then
suspension... eventually banning for those terminally stupid enough to not
realise they didn't get away with it the first few times they were caught...
and they do still keep getting caught :o)

uhmmm... I dunno about that.
Using already existing bugs/loopholes available to everyone isn't quite the
same as breaking into the code and creating whole new ones just for your own
advancement... but that's just MHO :o)


> anyone know what happens?

For code hacking? I'm happy so see those caught get instantly and
permanently banned from every Sony/VI product forever...
There are enough regular problems for the code-mystics in San Diego to sort
out and fix... without some cheating scum creating more and possibly
delaying something that might benefit an entire class :o)
