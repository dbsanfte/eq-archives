Please can someone help me

Yet again I have ventured into the wailing caves and cannot find Spider 
Soulspike.

Also I am in the bottom chamber reached with large orc key and have pressed 
a button on door - it says something about a gem in a tapestry but still no 
Garreg Stonccrusher and I am getting serious grief from Averus Justarius 
about not saving his father)

Can anyone help
