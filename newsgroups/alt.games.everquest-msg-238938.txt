I've known some Halfling clerics.  The ones I've met have been 
very nice people on average, which goes a long way toward dispelling the 
bad reputation Asslings as a whole tend to end up with.  The one real 
problem with them, that every Halfling cleric I've met complains about, is 
that they get @#$%! sick of being asked for a SoW... :)
