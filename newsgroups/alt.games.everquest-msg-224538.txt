I hope this will improve the gaming experience for the melee classes.
Especially the Warriors.  I heard countless times from casters that melees
are boring to play.  That all you needed to do was hit auto-attack and walk
away and then check back to see how the fight was going.  Changing it up to
allow melees to have special attacks that were non-Discs would add to the
flavor of the game.  I do not know if this update will add something like
this to the game but it would be cool if it did.  Even add animations.
Casters have very sweet looking animations for their spell effects.  How
about adding something out there for the melees.  Like when a melee
successfully dodges then you actually see the dodge on the screen.
