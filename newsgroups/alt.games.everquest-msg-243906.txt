Nah... it really was worse in the old days.    The spawn rate on them isn't
too high..   in those days it took a whole group to kill one, and the spawn
just wasn't enough to keep a group killing.   So they would just build up
and gank the lowbies.

Nowadays any level 60 passing through can easily solo them, so they don't
build up in the same way.  (How many level 60's passing a hill giant won't
take the 20 seconds to solo it for 10 - 40 pp?)   Also less people are
hunting the low level spawns there, so theres less chance of them spawning.
