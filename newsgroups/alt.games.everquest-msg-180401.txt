There are 2 ways to play a Beastlord.

1.Pet Cleric. Pet fights you heal, go Iksar for better Wisdom.
2.Melee. Fight beside you pet. Go Troll. HP/STR

Weapons:
Go 1hb 2hb Piercing and H2H.
H2H,1hb for fast dmg
2hb for raidsituations (slower hits=slower dmg on DS and reposte...)
Piercing for Emerald Skinning Knife (Summons lvl/4 Bandages as proc) 
great for soloing, and you dont have heals with Enchanter


I would say: Haste BST and slow mobs is the way to go.
BST are great soloers. with Bind Wound and their Little heals (I didnt 
had alot of downtime solo)
Slowed mobs with a Hasted Beastlord + Pet will not do alot dmg.
And fighting the mobs is more fun than the Rune/DS or Charm/Mez/Memblur 
tactic. I would say with straight playing, you will ding BST to 50 in 
about 4 days /played (did it in 8days with alot of traveling, bringing 
Skills up etc.)

Have fun...
