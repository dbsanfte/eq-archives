They get WoG to boost AC.  At the higher end, shaman buffs aside from Focus 
and sometimes Boar are not used, the stats are maxxed or close to it 
anyway.  Of course, there are nifty new buffs now that will buff over the 
cap, including a stamina one, but, OTOH, you can increase your buff slots 
with AA also now.
