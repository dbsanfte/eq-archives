Simple, as I posted some people are silly and use fictional characters
for names a lot more than you think.

For example, say son's name is drizit and someone elses account name
is drizzit. Say both have the goofball password drizit99 and the son
accidently types two z's in the account name - boom

It would normally be very uncommon but with people using fictional
characters as possibly their login and password, its more common.
