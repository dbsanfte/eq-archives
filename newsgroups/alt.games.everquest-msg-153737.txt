I rarely rarely see mages using rods to up their damage output.
Most raids I go on, anyone using rods for any purpose other
than clerics getting mana for heals and mages getting mana
to make more rods is subject to raid ejection.

Rods are in too short supply to waste on pathetic mana to
damage conversion, when a CHeal gets you 5000+ hp
for 400 mana.  Find me a nuke that comes close to
that level of efficiency and we will talk.

Actually, I can't see using mod rods much during a fight at all, if
a mod rod means 360 mana once a minute.  360 mana per
minute is a joke in terms of what I'm spending during a fight,
which is on the order of 2000 mana per minute.

So you suggest a 100 mana per minute alternative?  Thats one
twentieth of my consumption rate.  Again, at that point who cares?
I'd use it, mind you, but it would be about as important as my
Donals BP (free CHeal, once every 5 minutes per customer)

OK, you want a cleric, who's damage output is about 40 DPS according
to some sources, to instead keep you healed so YOU can do an
extra 10 to 40 dps?  Are you sure this makes sense?  After all, when
the fit hits the shan, I'd rather have the cleric get beat on than a
fragile little mage...

RoZ should get the same "suicidal pet" boost that UHOF and SoX got,
althought I don't think mages are going to get "two pets at the same time"
boost, so the thing will nonetheless be little more than a curiousity.

Bergh "UHOF when it cost 600 mana" Brelltender

ps: well, that cleric DPS did include pet and MoR, which could both
be cast and then forgotten while cleric kept you healed, so it wouldn't
be a full 40 DPS reduction
