100% mana, what's that, I'm happy if I'm at 40% most of the time.  Last
night I was in CoM with a Monk, Warrior, Rogue, Paladin, and my other pet,
Zibarab.  I was buffing, slowing (the tougher ones, the easy ones went down
too fast to be worth bothering with), sharing crowd control with the
Paladin, and I was the primary healer as well.  I did insist on some
meditation time when I was oom, and the Paladin did what he could to help
with healing and buffing.  I would always warn them when I was getting too
low on mana, and sometimes the pulling would even stop.  I had a blast, and
we had zero deaths.
