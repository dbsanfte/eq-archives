But at a cost of  420 mana. Why not get 1980 damage in 20 ticks for 400
mana.
Or even more damage err longer damage for less mana using focus items.

Perhaps the mana inefficiency is why they allow the stacking.
I  have noticed I can stack DoD over DD but am wondering if the DoD
overwrites the DD without a message. We can refresh a Dot before it expires.
I didn't test if it stacked or was overwritten.
