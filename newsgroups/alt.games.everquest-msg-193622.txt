My monk finished the Tynn Shackle (and Whistling Fists) at level 51. I 
got a druid friend to help me, so got a full round of level 54 druid 
buffs, including DS, before entering Cabilis to beat up Glox. He died 
when i was at 80%, without using mend, i would say a decently equipped 
level 48 with a DS and a few buffs can do easily.

Rinmark is another matter, hes a LOT harder. Got another full round of 
druid buffs and had the druid ready for heals if needed, but managed to 
take him, was at 40% health, using mend and stonestance.
