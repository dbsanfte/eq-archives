How many CDs did you get with that? Because I have the same thing, and 
as PB said, it consists of Kunark, which includes the old world, and 
Velious, in 2 CDs. In what sense the Trilogy is supposed to be 
different is what I don't understand. Maybe the old world will come in 
its own CD, now that it includes a bunch of newer zones.
