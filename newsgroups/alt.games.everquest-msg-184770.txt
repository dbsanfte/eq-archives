    On Saturday a druid with The Irreverent tried the turn-in on your server
(Quellious) and no Faydedar spawned. So either the dwarf was close to
respawn, someone else had got in and done the event in the small time
window, or the GM has permakilled him while investigating the bug.

    Other epics are much, much more restrictive in terms of how many can
come into the world per day. Consider yourself lucky.
