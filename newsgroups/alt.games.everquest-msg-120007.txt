Wizards are balanced in my opinion. Ports to the moon are downright stupid
for everyone. 100,000 dammage vs some mobs is plenty , 30,000 vs normal mobs
is not uncommon and even 20,000 instantly will do just fine.

You solo better than druids already if your not a complete schmuck. I
suggest you try the not to get hit. Wizards need at most a long casting low
mana usage dammaging spell set.
