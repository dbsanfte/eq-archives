Resists generally aren't needed on planes fights and such.  In Hate for
example, the only good resist will be magic, which will keep you from getting
Grav Fluxed at the first camp by the banshees.  Other than that, nothing uses
an AE attack.  In Fear, only the golem Terror uses an AE cold attack.  All of
the others are melee and death touch (unresistable) only.

You usually need them for high level single mob encounters, and in the very
end zones where all mobs have a 400 point AE.  Dragons mostly.

Your goals should be:

 1. Unbuffed simultaneous resists of 80magic + 100fire or 100cold or 100poison
or 100disease.

 2. Unbuffed simultaneous resists of 100cold + 100fire.

 3. Unbuffed single resist of 120 fire/cold or 100 poison/disease.
