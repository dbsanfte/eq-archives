Ahahha. Actually I'd say extracting as much time as possible.
Basically in a society where mmorpg play is prevelent it has the same
negative effects as a drug (losing job, not getting a job, doing
poorly in school, lying about the time spent playing to spouse/others,
saying you can quit playing at any time yet you don't, avoiding real
life events or time with real life spouse/friends to play the game
instead, etc)

Luckily the number of people playing them is still a small national
average so our society does not just fall apart (the number of
continual EQ subscribers is about that of my city in Nebraska, 450,000
or so.. of course that is spread over the entire world.) $9.89 a month
is nothing for a game you play for 2 and a half or 3 years,
considering that you save a WHOPPING TON in not buying single player
games at 49 bucks a pop during much of that time. I can't remember the
last time I bothered to get a single player game while previous to
getting the mmorpg bug I'd buy one whenever I finished one.

Original "fletching sucks" rant deleted since most people know how bad
trade skills are:
