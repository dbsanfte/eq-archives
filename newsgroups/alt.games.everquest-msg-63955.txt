The picture shows a card with a fan, although they do state that the
picture might not match the actual card.

Add in the cost of shipping, and the hassle fo receiving shipped
goods, and the annoyance factor if you get unlucky and get a dud and
have to return it...and I'd say it's better to just go down to Best
Buy or Circuit City...you should be able to get a GeForce 2 MX/400 64
MB for $99 at one of those places.
