i don't see anyone laughing,

and i don't see the point of being an asshole in the conversation
either


i own the software because i paid for it

i'm allowed to use it in any way that isn't prohibited by the law

the law is something like:

Title 17, US Code
=A7 106. Exclusive rights in copyrighted works

Subject to sections 107 through 122, the owner of copyright under this
title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the
following:

(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;

(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;

(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to
the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental,
lease, or lending;

(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic
works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to
perform the copyrighted work publicly;

(5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic
works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works,
including the individual images of a motion picture or other
audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly; and

(6) in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted work
publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.






i'm not going to hire a lawyer to figure out that there's nothing
wrong with bending the use of a product i paid for to do something
else privately, not-for-$

but you read that and tell me what's wrong with my private server idea



here's a better analogy: my private server is fan fiction
