I would say there are 2 good places to farm acrylia.  1.  Dawnshroud Peaks.
The sambatas drop it about 1 in 10 not to mention a bunch of other junk.  2.
The BEST place by far is Scarlet Desert.  The Bloodtribes are in this zone.
they are directly across the zone from Twilight Sea zoneline.  There are
hundreds of these little guys it seems.  I see acrylia drop about 1 in 5
here.

I'd recommend SD to you becasue you are higher level.  The bloodtribe have
their own faction.  it can only be lowered not raised.  If you've never been
to SD before, the other aliens will regard you indifferently.  I'm sure
you'll be amiable to the cheetahs, but watch the sunflowers and
lightcrawlers.  They are a pain.
