    Ah, him! I remember him from a long, long time ago, when my first guild
did an all-guild raid on Mistmoore. I was part of the "top level" group, and
we went up the tower and camped him. One Chestplate, and since we were
pulling other stuff to the tower we also got a Diamondine Earring. Boy, did
we think we'd struck it rich!
