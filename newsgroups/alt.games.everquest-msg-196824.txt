But its so easy!  And well lit, no rain, no night, no fog, no nothing,
always a sun blasted plain.

Yep, moving certainly makes some sense, its an easy enough zone to solo in
waiting for a group, and people keep joining in, I just need destinations to
lobby for moving to.

Sadly, I'm underwhelmed by DSP, did it a fair bit with my bard and in
retrospect I'd have been far happier somewhere without the choppy stop
motion effect that zone seems to generate.  Likewise I'm staying out of BW
and WL and Warsilks as much as I can this time, other choppy zones that come
to mind.

In retrospect, instead of "hmm, this isn't going to work we should run", I
should have said

INNIE! I JUST TOOK 20% of my health, thats like three of you casters dying!
RUN!

I rarely have HOV or even BOA, KEI vendors have no fixed cost and are
currently happily buffing me up on 25pp donations (even throwing in haste as
a bonus) while few clerics seem to work as vendors, and I'd definately feel
bad not at least doubling their peridot cost.

MS is an odd zone anyway, the mobs don't really hit all that hard and they
are all pretty close in level, the only exception I've found there would be
this Roethe guy.  Went in with my 57 bard and killed him, he was cyan to me,
and an easy cyan at that.  A bit diffferent for a 27 shaman, even though the
shaman had more HP at the time than the bard did!
