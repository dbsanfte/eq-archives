Ladders now cast root.

I got ladder stuck in Lower Guk, next to an angry and unfeeling
Corrupted Gnome explorer. He was less than happy with my mere
presence, so he and his buddy decided to whack on me. When trying to
get up the ladder, I got the notorius ladder root.

What was worse, was when I did the CR for me and my friends from GuK I
got ladder rooted in upper guk. Since I pissed off the ghouls so
badly, for the first time, I am only glowered at there.

I could hear a faint froggy laugh though at my perma-stuck position.
"frooock fr-fr-fr-fr-ooooak. Look at that Tierdal, fr-fr-fr-froooak"

It was followed by chuckles from the halfling druid who rescued me...
