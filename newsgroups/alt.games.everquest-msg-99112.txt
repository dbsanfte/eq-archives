Would prefer a heavier damaging 2hder but can't really think of any that you
could go after yourself.

Another Cougar Claw, maybe.

Fine, Rygorr Gorget (Rygorr Fort in EW) or Spider Fur collar (500pp) if you
wanted an alt but that's a nice Pally item.

> Face:  Silver Ruby Veil - Str 4, Wis 4
Id recommend something with AC. To buy, Antlered Mask AC7 +3str +5 agil +2
dex (from Kael) or Sarnak Hide mask AC6 +5 str (from Karnors) you're a bit
low yet to hunt these, prolly want to be close to 50 as a melee in KC. To
loot yourself the Dented Brass mask AC4 +3str from Goblin Archeologist in
Permafrost.

> Head:  Helm of Ro - AC 13, Wis 8
Blessed Knights (Twilight Sea, Quest amour) maybe but nothing really springs
to mind otherwise.

> Shoulder:  Adamantite Epaulets - AC 9, Wis 7
Would go for more AC and melee stats than Wisdom here, Crested Spaulders
from MM (still wearing these at 52 <sigh>)  Blessed Knights (Twilight Quest)
Pauldrons +11 AC +3 Str +1 Dex +3 Wis +1 vsMg +5 HP +5 Mana

Cheap buy Jagged Bands, normally under 50pp ea AC5 +3 str. Don't go for fire
emerald rings unless you're an Erudite and really low on strength...platinum
fire and velium fire wedding rings are best for tank classes.

> Wrist:  Serpentine Bracer AC 1, Agi 9, Dex 3, Hardened Kodiak Bracer AC 6,
> Str 3
With some help you could do the Hero bracers quest (you'll need good Steel
Warriors faction) get another Kodiak Bracer to be rid of the serp one for
now. Crustacean Bracers are good but hunting the Othmir is not always a
great idea for the faction hits (sell for under 200pp) and of course the
Bracer of Scavaging (as mentioned by Dan) from Warslik, Iksar bandit lord,
which is within your capabilities.

> Arm:  Fine Plate Vambraces - AC 10
Vambracers of Ro, Rygorr Sleeves (EW at Rygorr fort) Crustacean arms for a
cheap buy (no improvement on AC there tho, just stats) Not sure on stats of
Blessed Knights Vambracers

> Chest:  Breastplate of Ro - AC 20, Str 4, Fire 10
Blessed Knights BP +22 AC +8 Str +3 Dex +5 Wis +2 vsMg +2 vsFire +2 vsCold
+20 HP +10 Mana
For more AC you can prolly pick up EB BP (ac25) for under 500 or less now.
Not really one of your weaker spots, tho.

> Back:  Dire Wolf-hide Cloak - AC 7, Str 5
Fireclaw's Carapace (40th level dd proc'ing Umberbulk in Echo Caverns) this
is his common drop but bring friends he is mean. To buy Spider Fur Cloak
(500pp) AC10 +4str/sta +6vs Cold

> Feet:  Charred Boots - AC 6, Agi 3, Poison 5, Fire 5
Eww Fineplate at least, Ro if you can (Blessed Knights obviously as well)

> Legs:  Greaves of Ro - AC 13, Sta 6, Cold 10
No immediate suggestions, Blessed Knights Greaves are better but again, this
isn't a weak spot.

Grats on the roll :�)

> Hands:  Sebilite Scale Gloves - AC 12, Agi 4, Int 4, Mag 2, Disease 2
Gaunts of the Black (sell for 500 and less) drop off named orc in Rygorr
(Firbrand the Black or something, these are the common drop, Dark Ember the
rare)

You'll want a couple of levels on for the Blessed Knights armour quests. The
quests aren't hard as such but getting the right mobs to spawn can take some
doing. Haven't looked at what is required for BK armour but if any parts
drop off Shadows you'll want a couple of friends, at least, to help(one to
chain heal you and another nuker will be good, the lifetaps are nasty and
the Named ones proc a lot) they are undead but don't think they are a walk
over. Many of the items are worth getting for Paladins, the warrior ones are
a bit poor imo but I think the Pally ones are a much needed improvement on
Ro armour.

Another thing to consider, not sure if you are in the level rat race or not
but if you can make some plat, Deep Water armour is very cheap (obviously it
has some pricey parts to it and the BP and Legs are going to be very
expensive) helm is about 700pp or less, Gaunts around the same and arms I
have seen for 1k, boots are also cheap (2k ish from what I remember) so as
you approach 45 you may want to take some time to slow down on the level
rush and do some Hill Giants or other money making spawns. Of course you
could just rush the levels, get into KC and see if you can get some
yourself, not sure how common DW is, Singing Steel and Tolans always seem to
drop when I am there :�/
