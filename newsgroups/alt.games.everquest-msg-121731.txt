No, you have to be in the zone.  However, one person could go to Permafrost
and zone in and check Vox, rather than bringing a whole party to fight their
way in to see if she is up.

A guild looking for something to do can send 4 or 5 people who use ShowEQ to
quickly check out the situation in 4 or 5 dungeons, and pick something for
the guild to do.

I started to write something like that once, but never got around to
finishing it.  The idea was that computer #2 would monitor the EQ log file
on computer #1, watching for zone changes and /loc output, and display a map
of the current zone, with the location of the last /loc marked.
