"You put in your time"? It's a game, jackass, not a job. NOTHING on
the account belongs to you. A good lawyer could nail you for fraud for
selling something which is not yours to sell, I'd wager.

Read the EULA. If they really wanted to take the time to do so, I'd
wager Verant could nail you for contract violation.

Get over it. You spent two years paying for entertainment. It no
longer entertains you. Move on. It's a source of entertainment, not an
investment. If you felt the time was wasted, no one was forcing you to
put the time into it.
