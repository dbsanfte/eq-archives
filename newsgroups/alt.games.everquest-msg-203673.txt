Newbies would be level 10 before they had 1k for the level 10 potion, and
level 25 before they had 10k for the level 25 potion.  It would be a pretty
safe bet that these would be almost exclusively used by twinks.

Something similiar was added to DAoC recently: if you have a level 50
character on your account (50 is the highest level in DAoC), you can start
new characters at 20.
