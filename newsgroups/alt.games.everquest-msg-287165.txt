"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately
 explained by stupidity."  [Robert J. Hanlon]

To be fair, even if SOE did set up an automated or minimally manual
banning of this spammer's accounts, the spammer could just create
new ones, and the main result would be massive churning of the user
database.  A better solution would be some way to prevent trial
accounts from sending the spam at all; LOTRO did that, and gold spam
has mostly vanished there.  (Actually, I think LOTRO banned tutorial
characters from sending to most channels, including tells, and it
takes long enough to go through the tutorial that it's not worth the
spammers' efforts.)  But in EQ, a level 1 trial-account character is
able to zone into POK and interact with "regular" characters, plus
preventing such characters from using the NewPlayers channel would
sort of defeat its purpose.

Speaking of the LOTRO spam, though, my recollection is that the site
that was doing most of the spamming there is the same as the one I've
been seeing in EQ, so I really doubt it's SOE doing it, unless it's a
*really* devious plot!
