Incorrect.  I think I see the problem here, you really don't see
logically.  Let me elaborate so you can see where you went wrong in your
thesis.  If we take the assumption that Velious was added specifically
with the intention of adding high level content as a given (which is
pretty safe since VI said that's what they were doing.) we can surmise
that the developers felt there was a need for adding high level
content.  There is a direct relationship here, a need for the content
provided by the expansion.  Trying to relate the addition of high level
content to a lack of  concern or desire to please lower level players
does not find support in the simple fact that Velious was designed to
add  high level content.  The fact that the expansion was of a high
level nature neither proves nor disproves the theory that VI has no
concern for low level players.  As such your statement attempting to
relate the two concepts made me laugh, as does your insistence on
reasserting the point.
