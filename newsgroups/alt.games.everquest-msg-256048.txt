If you are in a pickup group attempting to charm kill I can see you getting
killed lots.  However all of the folks in my group are used to it and know
what to do when charm drops, keep the charm pet snared always, have /shield
chanter hotkeyed, stun, chain snare on pet from ranger to get agro and move
it off someplace for recharm.  It's not as difficult as you make it seem.
