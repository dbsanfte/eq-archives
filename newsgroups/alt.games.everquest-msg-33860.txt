Drop from Sand Giants in NRo, Oasis and SRo.
Guess you need them for pottery, on Veeshan i (when i made wis deities)
payed 15-50pp for them, offered 15 to sellers, but if they said 50 i
would buy them.
ï¿½f you ask nicely in Oasis or the Ros you can maybe get some for free, i
got a lot for free when sitting at Oasis docks and shouting buffing for
free, or for Sands of Ro donations.
Several high level people gave me some without getting buffs since they
didnt need them.
