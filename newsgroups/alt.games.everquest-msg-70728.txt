Wow, given that allakhazam redirects you to castersrealm for the calculator,
that would be very surprising.

Either way, it's a fairly trivial exercise to back out the formula from the
calculator.  I used the castersrealm calculator that I got to via Allakhazam
Classes page.

For a Wis caster:

With Wis less than 201:
Level*(Mana/5+2)

With Wis greater than 200:
Level*42+(Wis-200)*6-(Wis-200)/5

In both cases rounding down.

I believe that the formula for Int casters is the same, replacing Wis with
Int.
