I'm assuming you're about the lowest level member of the party going and
the rest are all Seb veterans, yes? If the answer to that is no, I'd
advise not going. he he. Assuming the answer is yes, then just stick
with the group, keep your eyes open, and listen carefully. Also, be very
mindful of the cliffs and such on the walk down, particularly near jail.
If you fall off the ledges into the water far below you're going to wind
up, in very short order, looking extremely silly and dead.  And the CR
wont' be any fun at all.
