I still use slam with my shaman in a pinch.  I've stopped a few CHeals from
happening that way.  Last one was the Burning Priest in SD, stopped two of
them with slam, when the cleric's stuns were being resisted.  Mind you, my
slam is not something I count on, being as my skill level in it is pitiful,
but every little bit helps.  It seems unlikely that my Pally will ever hit
20, I am currently concentrating on my Warrior twink, and a new Enchanter
twink.
