I have Kunark, but not velious. what is the difference in the two
interfaces.

Also, when i hit F10 to change the screen mode, i have to keep all the
settings at
640 480 otherwise the graphics cards, (geoforce 2 gts) takes a couple of
seconds to
change resolution, and if and I switch mode too oftion the game just locks
up.
I understand that u can have the window mode(non transparent) as a small
rectangle in the centre of the screen when in 1024 768 but that is hardly
ideal.

If EQ could fully support higher resolutions, in all screen modes, including
1280
1024 for example, it would improve the look of the 3D graphic.

dont know what they got lined up so maybe all these probs will be fixed
