I'm sure they wouldn't remove them...Nerf them maybe but not remove
entirely.
They've already put in a playing time alarm, I can imagine an enforced time
limit set with "Trader" status after which it logs you off.
Personally I'd rather they upped the price by a dollar or 2 than drop the
Bazaar. Although I spent a lot of time buying and selling (i EC) and made
plenty of cash from it, it is much nicer to be able to pop into the bazaar
when you want to get an upgrade for an item. Maybe not so much for the Mid
to High levels but for lower levels it leaves much more time to play.
