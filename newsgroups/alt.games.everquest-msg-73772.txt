Perhaps you should have refered to that part, because it clues you into the
fact that I'm no longer talking about the fungi tunic, but about nerfing in
general.  Funny how leaving out a line like that changes someone's entire
argument.

Except that I said nothing about such speculation, nor is it relevent, as
we're not talking about the fungi tunic situation anymore, as stated in the
above referenced statement that you ignored.

Again, completely irrelevent to my point.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
