252 x 5% = 12. 6. So your meditate is 264.6, boy, that calculator
everyone gets with windows is useful sometimes. Basically its like
being at a higher level of meditate. Its not going to be something
you'd notice for the most part unless you had several plus 5 percent
items. This is why, as you mention the cloak being otherwise good, I'd
not get ANY of these percent items for the percent alone unless the
item itself was good.

Bingo! Well, I'm going to hazard a guess that 5 percent means 5
percent! GO FIGURE! ;) If it was 5 points it would say plus 5 points,
not 5 percent.

They've never explained that. I'd imagine you can go over cap though
because otherwise since meditate would be maxxed for most people
getting uber items with a plus percent it would be pretty pointless
for them to have it.

Verant has never stated that either. I'd ASSume so.. for one thing
there are not many of them in the game and you'd not want to sacrfice
slots with better items for a lot of them even if you had more than
one.

Exactly, its works the same way.. hmm that really makes 5 percent
skill items much nicer than I originally thought..

>goods worth of work and time.  

Exactly, especially if the guy from verant who is the tradeskills
designer is right and ONLY your skill in the trade determines success
while the highest of your wis or int is only for chance to skill up.
Maybe as the designer he doesn't know (I'd find that hard to believe)
but if he is right it makes these items seem even better since you
have a 5 percent higher chance of success when piling on wis or int
gear is not going to help.

Yes. If it increased your skill 5 percent while using it your skill is
increased while using it. That would make an item trivial therefore no
skill advance. I guess you've hit on a reason a person might want to
remove the item.
