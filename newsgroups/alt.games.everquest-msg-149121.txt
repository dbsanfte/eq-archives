I hate to say it, but you're dead wrong on this issue.  If they don't like
you, they have the right to deny you an account.  They're allowing people to
pay them for access to a private service that they own.  Because they own
it, they have the sole right to say you aren't allowed access.  They could
use whatever reason they wanted to and it would be legal.

If you want a real-life analogy, take a look at the Masters golf tournament.
There are people who are upset that the Masters is held at a private country
club that doesn't have any female members.  Many organizations, from NOW to
the LPGA, have placed pressure on the country club to admit a female member.
The country club has adamantly refused to do so.  And guess what?  They have
the legal right to refuse.  The NOW and the LPGA could sue the country club
all they wanted to, but because it's a private golf course, they'd have no
legal basis.

This is just incorrect.  I don't know how to put it any other way except to
say that you're confusing the constitutionally guaranteed rights of freedom
of expression to mean you should be allowed to go anywhere you want.  Read
the Constitution carefully, and see exactly what it allows you to do.
Freedom of expression, a right to a trial by a jury of your peers, etc.  But
not a right to go wherever you want to go.  Not a right to take whatever you
want to take.  And if I give everyone an ice cream cone except you, the
Constitution does not guarantee your right to get an ice cream cone.
