    The issue of guilds killing every Ragefire spawn to stockpile containers
on cleric twinks. The way the quest stands now, you can only deal with
Ragefire if you've done the entire rest of the quest to that point. Now, any
group can kill him for whatever reason they want.

    That would cause the same problem as before - people rushing to hand in
the pearl first, so they could attempt Ragefire. It would be even worse,
considering that with a random Ragefire also being in the game that people
in Skyfire wouldn't know if it was a triggered Rage or not. Imagine handing
in your pearl, then finding some other guild killed "your" Ragefire. And no,
a guild that wants him won't believe any number of people /ooc'ing "About to
spawn Ragefire, he's ours, really!"

    That's the whole point of making it No Rent: reduce the number of people
who would kill the random spawn for the cleric container. Reducing the
number of people who'd kill him reduces the tension.

    The idea was that the once combined, the box would be No Drop but NOT No
Rent. So a cleric would have to drop between when they looted it and when
they placed the pearl from Sol B in and hit "combine". Not a huge worry.
Unless they feel that players doing the quest out-of-order is remotely "as
intended". Even if the cleric DID lose a box, no worries. They still have
their pearl, and can just kill Ragefire again.

> Besides that, they want to make it less bottleneck causing.

    No, they don't. Before, Rage spawned two to three times a week if Nag
was cleared. Now, he spawns.... two to three times a week. NO bottleneck has
been cleared, but a ton of new players have been added who can compete to
kill Ragefire and get something useful from it.

    And every guild with ANY clerics online can be called there to get the
twink a box. Why bother for a twink? Well, they'll need a Sprinkler someday
anyways maybe, and you can always justify the effort by selling the Cloak of
Flames you hope drops.

    The only reason fire giants had to be cleared before was so the campers
wouldn't be killed by them. It didn't help spawn Ragefire. Indeed, some
people camping Ragefire left them up in order to give themselves time to CoH
a raid force in before another guild could bust through and hand in the
pearl.

    Are you kidding me? If I WANT my epic, I'll stay the 72 hours in
Skyfire, same as Sol B. Because if I don't, someone else WILL take him. The
camp hasn't ended, just moved.

    They relaxed your bottleneck. They have not done so for clerics.

    You seem somewhat confused. Handing the pearl to the guy in Sol B
doesn't spawn Ragefire anymore. Ragefire is a totally independent spawn,
appearing two to three times per week. Think of him like Sev in Emerald
Jungle for the warrior epic. You know, Sev the permacamped dragon? And the
warrior epic isn't worth half what the cleric epic is to a guild. So, given
that now MORE people can kill Ragefire, and he doesn't spawn any faster, how
do you come to that conclusion?

    Yup, it blew on servers where it was a competition. On my server, by and
large a Ragefire camp was respected as long as you were clearing the fire
giants and weren't sitting on Zordak for hours, waiting for help. That
courtesy will not be extended to an open spawn. I don't care HOW long you've
been sitting in Skyfire, if I have the people there I'm taking that dragon.

    Unless they engaged Ragefire and started kiting it around the zone,
waiting for help to arrive. Just like Lodizal. Ragefire IS the new Lodizal.
