Heh.  Actually I guess he's probably not as camped these days, since
Warriors, Rogues and Bezerkers can just buy ornate guantlets, for a 30%
spell haste instead of this (usually) looooooong camp for a 20% spell haste
item.

Much the same way that our little group has found Drusilla Sathair up 2
times in a row now, where she used to be permacamped.  100hp Aura of Battle
item, that can be worn in 3 slots, still sounds damn fine to us non heavy
raiders.

I don't know of anyone thats done tests, but I'd be willing to give odds
that we're on the "non-hybrid" classification, so it's both stopping your
attacks and resetting the delay.   Of course, with a fast weapon and item
plus spell hastes, it's probably under a second of difference between
resetting the delay and resuming it.  The interrupts making you click 2 or 3
times is what kills you there.
