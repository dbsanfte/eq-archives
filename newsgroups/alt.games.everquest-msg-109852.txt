I have used /follow many times and have never seen it switch the state of my
run/walk button.

I have played a variety of characters, and never seen a difference in run
speed that had anything to do with Agility.  I have seen the evidence
presented by various folks that have done actual timed tests with characters
that had different agilities, with the result that Agility has no effect
whatsoever on run speed.  When you are injured you do slow down, you also
lose Agility, both are caused by the injury.  I have a pretty decent agility
buff available to my Shaman, and whether I have it cast on myself or not has
not affected my run speed one bit.
