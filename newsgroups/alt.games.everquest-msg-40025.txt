She can cry me a fucking river about how badly she was treated. She
volunteered to be a guide and work for free. She obviously continued
being a guide for quite some time because she was afraid to give up
that little bit of power she had in EverQuest. She's so elitist that
she probably enjoyed the suffering. It made her feel better about
herself. She is proof that anonymous power-mongering on the internet
transcends gender.

Oh, and making fun of people by calling them 'd00ds' or 'l33t' or
whatever pasty-faced acronyms elitists use on the internet for people
who are not as smart as they are is just as annoying as being one
yourself. Adding crack cocaine references only makes it worse.
