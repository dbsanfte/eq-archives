What is included in the EverQuest II preorder package?

The EverQuest II Starter Kit includes:

The full game's unparalleled character creation tool, which allows you to
create & save your characters
Unique account key that will grant your character a pair of Journeyman Boots
for an extra burst of speed
Special EverQuest II content including a behind the scenes video, exclusive
MP3s from the soundtrack, and the official trailer
Fan Site Kit for building your own EverQuest II website
The E3 demo movie with narration by Scott Hartsman
The first chapter of our lore series telling what has occurred in the 500
years since EverQuest took place (to be continued on everquest2.com)
System scan that evaluates your current hardware configuration
Special offers for incredible savings on PC upgrades to enhance your gaming
experience
Where can I purchase the Starter Kit?

The Starter Kit will be available through major retail outlets in the US, as
well as many online retailers including the Station Store. Generally
speaking, most retailers who ordinarily sell preorder discs will be carrying
the EverQuest II Starter Kit.

When will the Starter Kit be available?

The Starter Kit will be available for sale as soon as retailers receive
their shipments. The official start of the preorder campaign is August 2,
2004. Some retailers may offer it sooner.

Will the Starter Kit be sold outside the US?

Yes. The Starter Kit is being distributed by certain retailers in the
following countries:

Canada
UK
Germany
Australia
Austria
Scandanavia (Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland)
If you live in one of the countries listed above, check with your local
retailer to see if they will be distributing the Starter Kit.

If I have an existing preorder for EverQuest II, will I be sent the Starter
Kit automatically?

Distribution of the Starter Kit is determined by the retailers who carry it.
Sony Online Entertainment does not control how retailers offer the Starter
Kit to their customers. Ask your retailer for details.

Are there multiple versions of the Starter Kit being sold by different
retailers in the US?

No, there is only one version of the EverQuest II Starter Kit being sold in
the US. The full game will be available in several different configurations,
but there is only one preorder kit.


Is the Starter Kit being sold internationally exactly the same as the one
sold inside the US?

The special offers for savings on PC upgrades will not be included in the
Starter Kit sold outside the US. Other than that, the packages are
identical. The Starter Kit is only available in English and will not be
translated into other languages.


Are the Journeyman Boots the same item that appeared in the original
EverQuest?

Our Journeyman Boots, sturdily crafted by Hasten Bootstrutter, do not offer
the exact same run-speed enhancement as the originals did in EverQuest.
While quite useful, the speed effect will be a minor enhancement that does
not unbalance gameplay for those who do not own the boots, and it is not
intended to replace the more powerful run-speed buffs that certain classes
cast as spells.


How many pairs of Journeyman Boots will I get?

The Starter Kit gives you one pair of boots. They can only be given to one
character per account, and cannot be traded or sold to any other character.

 I heard that the skins of certain races were recently redone. Will the
Starter Kit include the new skins?

Yes, the Starter Kit includes the newest versions of the character skins.


Does the Starter Kit include every character customization option that will
be in the finished game?

Our character team may include additional customization options in the
finished game that do not appear in the Starter Kit. You will still have the
option to modify any characters you have saved once you load them into the
finished game. Your choices are not final until you name the characters and
they are saved on our servers.


Will the Starter Kit be made available for download?

We have no plans to offer the Starter Kit for download. The primary purpose
of the kit is to generate interest for EverQuest II at retail outlets.
