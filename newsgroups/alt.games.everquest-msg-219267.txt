Eh.   Even before the changes to the newbie levels decreasing the experience
needed for 1 - 10, and eliminating corpse runs for those levels, it was
still less than one evening's play time to log in and, with nothing more
than your newbie sword, play up to level 4.   You didn't even have to leave
your starting zone in most cases.

I mean, I don't mind that this guy is saying he prefers UO to EQ.   Both
games have different strenghts, and I can well see how someone could prefer
that overall.  But making the comment that he has given EQ a fair chance
because he played for a year (while his results in game suggest a /played
time of more like 6 hours over that year) seems... well, misleading is the
nicest characterization I can find for it.
