Matt,

Fair assessment.  You're right, it's not a bargain.  But, that is how much
they're going for.

I could just sell the $20, $30 and $50 ones...But, the DSP-500 is really that
good.  Actually, any binaural DSP headset works great. Plus, it's the holidays
and is a decent gift for gamers.

I could also suggest the Andrea NC-1212 Pro Gamer Headset - $39

Thanks,
