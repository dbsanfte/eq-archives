No problem on my AMD 4200+ dual-core.  My guesses for what might cause this on
an upgraded machine that had no previous problems:
  1) heat problems, especially if you changed video cards and your case isn't
     well-cooled.  Try running it with the cover off and see if it happens.  
  2) driver problems, especially if it isn't a fresh WinXP install, and/or if
     you upgraded video card along with chip (and probably mobo).  Check
     drivers for EVERYTHING, especially video and sound.
  3) power problems, if you changed to a greedier chip or gpu and
     didn't upgrade the power supply.  No way I know to diagnose this other
     than trying it with a bigger PS.

I've not heard of any problems on dual-core chips per se.
