The reasons for Everquest's collision coding decisions have been well-known
for quite some time now. They are not bugs, they are intentional, and are
unlikely to change until Everquest 2.

Allegedly, food having differing effect times was part of the plan from day
one, but could not be encoded for one reason or another.

Why you would whine about a change players have long asked for is beyond me.
It's a wonderful change that simply makes sense.

Whine for a living? Verant has never told players that type of information,
and they've not done so for a reason. It's amazing you assume that reason is
because players - the people who pay them - are at the bottom of their
priority list. Stupid, even.

They want the players to figure the stuff out, just as they want players to
figure out where new items are sold, what various trade skill recipes are,
and how much experience various mobs give.

But please, don't let me interrupt your whine.
