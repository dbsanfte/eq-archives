Actually, I spent a lot of time listening to people in my guild complain
about this problem, but I never experienced it.

Yes, I do use a customized UI (thank you T.King).

I logged in in the Bazaar, popped to Shadeweaver, booked to PoK and then
Erudin, zoned to Paineel, Warrens, Stonebrunt, hunted a while, then popped
back to Shadeweaver.  Never a bobble.

The only problem I did have was that I normally play in 1024X768, but when I
came in I was in 800X600.  Reset the system to my standard, and never had a
single problem.
