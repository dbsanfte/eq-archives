I'm using the video card in another machine and i turned everything on
except the luclin models and social animations and it's fine.. so I'm back
to the drawing board. I assume it's something to do with the cpu,
motherboard or ram, but if i replace one i basically have to replace the
lot, so I'm down to one pc. :P

It's runnign w2k server which i'm using for training, and that's not great
for games no matter how you tweak it, but it'll have to do.
