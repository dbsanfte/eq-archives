Why I left SWG for EQ:

SWG is easy and yet unbalanced. They really encourage PvP, but it's 
terribly FUBAR.

I went for an entertainer/image designer/musician, and achieved Grand 
Master status in all three within 4 weeks. After I did that, and earned 
enough money to buy any outfit I wanted... money is so easy to come by 
that everything ends up being really cheap. I never killed anything.... 
but I still became a millionare within 6 weeks.

And if you indulge in PvP, it's terribly unbalanced. One person with the 
right skill set (like say a medic with poison skill) can kill 100+ 
people over and over. Sure, they can kill him, but he just repops and 
does it over again, and gets more points for every PvP kill. There are 
PvP guilds that are griefer guilds on most servers.

Regular fighters also have trouble finding medics and entertainers to 
heal them. Do tip your healers- their whole game is keeping you healthy- 
and they are playing for interraction with you.

They were still trying to develop "battlefields" and "dungeons" when I 
left last month. As well as fixing everything.

Last I knew, death had no penalties- it was just a pain in the butt.
