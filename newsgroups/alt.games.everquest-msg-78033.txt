Annie... thank you!

Just got back from my 3rd viewing of LOTR. I'm going with a girlfriend again
tomorrow night. She can't get enough of Strider/Aragorn and I can't get
enough lof Legolas, so we figured we'd go together and giggle mindlessly
(like I haven't done in 30 years) Gods, this movie has brought out the worst
in me....

Or maybe the best.
