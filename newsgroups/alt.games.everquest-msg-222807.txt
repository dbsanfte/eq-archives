I think people are misinterpreting the data here.  50% Griefing
doesn't mean that half your motivation is to grief people, or that
it's your primary motivation (assuming it's your highest number.) 
What it means is that, among the people who took this survey, you are
perfectly average.  If 2000 total non-griefers take the survey and
then you come along and once got revenge on someone, you'd score 100%.
 Since most people don't grief and are against griefing, low scores
are going to be commonplace.  50% means you, like most people, are not
a griefer.  Even 75% may not reflect actual griefer tendencies. 
Remember - the numbers are only comparing you to the other
respondents, not to a base set of answers.
