Speaking of bad ass AoE it is a good idea to keep a close watch on your
Allah faction. Once that is hosed you can't even take a piss in the Qeynos
sewers or play a round of golf on Hollowshade without getting serious aggro
everywhere you turn. I wonder whose idea it was to have AoE attacks on level
one mobs anyway?

Where is Absor Omar Mohammad Omar Mohammad Mohammad Mohammad Omar these
