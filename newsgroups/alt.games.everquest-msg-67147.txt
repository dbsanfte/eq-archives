Uhm, whenever something is transparent (Sword blades, shadow wolves of shamas, etc), I have
trouble. All solid things appear nicely on screen, but the transparent objects are
either correctly visible at some distance/angle to them, or they get messed up. Either,
their background is totally over them (making them totally invisible .. in
case of my shaman pet, I only see the nametag), or partially visible, if as smaller
background texture covers parts of the transparent thing (I could for instance see
a paladins solid swordhilt, then his blade (transparent) was invisible, till it hit
the horizon of the landscape, where I saw the rest of the plade, as the 'sky' horizon
texture did not overlay the blade, but the 'ground/grass' ones did. I have this
problem since they changed to the DX8 stuff. Does anybody have similar problems?

I run a GeForce 3 card on Windows XP with the newest NVidia drivers of yesterday
installed. The machine is an AMD Thunderbird at 1 Ghz with 512 MB of ram,
no SoL installed (just Kunark & Velious).
