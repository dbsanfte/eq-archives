That is good advise, although I've probably maxed out the right-click items
I'm likely to obtain with an eye of zomm bracelet (every mage should have
this - quest is super easy) and summon companion belt (great for pet
positioning in LDoN).  There are a couple of right-click DS items that I
could realistically obtain - either the Robe of the ArchMage (casts the 25
pt DS) or the Elemental Legging's of the Prime (assuming I could afford the
ornate pattern, casts the 45 pt DS).  However, I have LDoN gear for both my
chest and leg slots, so I'm not going to wear those items.  It they are
clickable from inventory, then they have some value, but overall they're
probably more trouble or expensive than they're worth for a DS item.  There
are other items - a malosinia mask, for example - but these drop off
raid-level encounters as far as I know.
