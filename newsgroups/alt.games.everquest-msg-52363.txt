On your own, no, you are going to be KOS to several ogre factions.
You need to cast alliance on someone who is on Clurg faction, and
you won't be able to do that while KOS to the faction of the other
two in the room with him.

If you can get someone to pull those two off, you might be
able to pull it off, I'm not sure just -how- KOS you are.

If you can get wolf form, you might be able to do it that way,
the ogres seem to be pretty much indifferent to that.

Traditional wisdom states that only a DE enchanter can do
the quest at 8th level... alliance is needed even in DE form,
and that DE Enchanter can put on human form to get the
compendium in the first place.

Without help, I think this is correct, there are several people
who can pull it off by 15th... but not at 8th.
