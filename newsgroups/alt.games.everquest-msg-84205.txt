As Jimc so aptly demonstrates the time between forage refreshes is so
insanely long that you'd not want to do that if you ever had to hit
another hotkey. 

You are likely thinking the use would be to forage while you are AFK
watching tv or something. Problem: you'd not be able to get the first
forage in your pack via a macro which would mean it would stay on your
mouse button and not allow another one to be there.
