Ah, now the light dawns; I didn't take this into account at all, of course
in my defense we don't have much by way of fancy disciplines on the 
Combine server yet, no AA and only the discs found on the sole warrior 
discipline tome vendor in Freeport.  As an SK, this means I have 
Fearless and Resistant.

I wouldn't be surprised if this got nerfed, but I also wouldn't be 
surprised if it took them another five years to get around to it, since 
it really doesn't seem to be used much; it was the high visiblity of 
Team Gore manaburning kunark dragons in single group that got that one 
hit with the nerf bat.

Berg, 60 SK, Combine
