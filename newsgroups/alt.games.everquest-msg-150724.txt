The formula for up to 200 is Level*(INT/5 + 2).  So, 173 total INT gives 878
Mana plus 20 gives 898.  What is your spell specialization area?  200 is
just a bit over 1/5th of that, so it should take a bit over one bubble to
cast the pet.  If your specialization is reducing that cost at all, or you
have any focus items to reduce the cost, then that could explain it, or,
it's pretty close to just one bubble as it is, and may just look like that
on the screen too.

As far as what is wrong with the calculator, it is asking for your total,
modified intelligence, not just the amount of the modifier.  235 mana is
what you would have if your total intelligence was 39, with modifiers.  You
should put in 173 for your modified intelligence to get the correct value.
