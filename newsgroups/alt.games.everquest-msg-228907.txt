For a more serious answer:

It cost your cleric a peridot to cast Virtue, so just to give him at a
minimum their own costs back 12 platinum.  This is appropriate for a cleric
you're grouping with, or on a raid with.  Giving him/her a peridot in return
is also considered acceptable, if not preferable.

If you're hiring a cleric to drop a Virtue on you before you go out to group
or raid without them, I'd consider anything less than 20 an insult.  Face
it, they're sitting in PoK to make money, not to be a buff service without
compensation.  When I buy a virtue, I usually give the cleric 50 plat.  I
have in the past done 30 and a peridot, or given them four or five peridot
and no cash.  Never got a complaint.
