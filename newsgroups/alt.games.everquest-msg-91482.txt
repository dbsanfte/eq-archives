If you think *that's* funny, how about this one:

[Tue Feb 26 00:28:17 2002]
     You slash orc pawn for 89 points of damage.
     You have slain orc pawn!
     Your faction standing with Death Fist Orcs could not possibly get any worse.
     Your faction standing with Death Fist Orcs could not possibly get any better.
     Your faction standing with Death Fist Orcs got better.
     Your faction standing with Death Fist Orcs got better.
     Your faction standing with Death Fist Orcs got better.
     orc pawn says 'Aaarrghh!! The Deathfist shall hunt you down. 
          My death will not go unnoticed. '

First it couldn't get any worse.  Then immediately thereafter, it
couldn't get any better.  Then it *does* get better, three times in a row.
