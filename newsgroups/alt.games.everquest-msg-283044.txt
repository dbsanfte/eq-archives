Greetings,

From IGN: http://tinyurl.com/k255z

"Rashere has confirmed at Fan Faire that the level cap will be raised
to 75 with the next expansion. 

"There is a rumor of a new starting city as well, but no mention of
where that might be located. It makes sense that a new starting city
would follow from an expansion release where you can go level from 1-
70 (75 now!) in the same expansion."

Travis "Rashere" McGeathy was the lead designer of at least the last
two EverQuest Live expansion packs.

Best regards,

Tim ==
