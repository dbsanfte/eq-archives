A flag is a label on your character given to you when you complete an
event..

For Example.

To get into the Plane of Valor originally you had to go to Plane of Justice.
Go to the tribunal and complete an event. On completion you would gain a
character flag which would allow you to zone into Valor and Storms. And so
on. A lot of flagging requirements have been removed from tier 2/3 planes
but if you wish to proceed into the elemental planes you will still need to
follow the entire storyline of flags etc.
