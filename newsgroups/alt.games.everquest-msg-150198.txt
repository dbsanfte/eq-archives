Sorry if this has already been posted by me today, my article didnt show 
on my news server after posting it so i think there was some error.

I recently deleted an old necro character i had as i wanted to reuse the 
character name to start a halfling druid but the server rejected the 
name even though it had accepted the same name for the old character!
To make matters worse it also rejects the name it suggests itself!
I reported this as a bug ages ago but still isnt fixed.
Anyone know any workarounds?
