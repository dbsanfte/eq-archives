Oh, the transaction is perfectly legal.  It's your account, you can sell it
if you want to.  The fact that Verant doesn't like it, doesn't make it
illegal.  On the other hand, Verant is under no obligation to honor the
account after they learn of the transfer.  Again, perfectly legal, but the
terms of the agreement.

The net result is the same, but it's important to be accurate about the
means of getting there.
