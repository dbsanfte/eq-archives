Hehehe.....my chanter does that every time she goes back into Freeport
for spells. I get right near the T of the two hallways and cast minor
illusion. Then i hit F9 3 times. I wait till someone walks by. Every
once in a while people are running and stop dead in their tracks and
turn around. Then I type "Smell me". Its hilarious. I get inspected a
lot. Damnit! Wish they would stop looking at my equipment!!! How dare
them!.
