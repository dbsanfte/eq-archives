If you want to run around playing armies you have to expect some flack.
We have to have some line drawn between what's right and what's not.
Yeah, they probably could have got him, but it wasn't him they wanted,
but the build-up of arms...or that's the story I'm given to understand.
I am not justifying the way over the top reaction, just the fact that
people keep saying innocents, when these people are anti-establishment,
so it's obvious the establishment will use them as an example. If you
don't want your head shot off stop sticking it out the window and
shouting "I have lots of guns!"
All I can say is I'm glad I'm not on the same continent, it's bad enough
having the threat of the IRA over here.
By the way. Where do these assholes get off with their Dial A Racist
crap? Is that all part of the constitution?
