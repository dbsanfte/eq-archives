From what I understand (from reading the lore) the frogloks of Guk and the
Frogloks of Gukta are 2 completely different factions.  The ones in Guk are
still "wary and hostile" because of what happened to them, whilr the
frogloks of Gukta are more trusting/friendly or whatever you want to call
it, so killing the froggies in Guk won't have any effect on your Gukta
faction.  Shouldn't, anyway....
