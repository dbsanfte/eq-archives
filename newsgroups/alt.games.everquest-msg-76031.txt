Ok, let me get this straight... you played EQ for a good while. You enjoyed
it on some level or you wouldn't have played it at all, after awhile (like
me, with DAoC)... but when you were playing, you hated it? Or do you
just -now- hate it, after you've quit? Most people find that 'addictions'
are addictions because they feel good, on some level, in some way. But you
say you hate it -because- it was addicting? I'm sorry... I'm confused. This
seems like questionable logic to me.

I love EQ. I have from the first. I can't play enough to suit me. I still
have a life, and even if that life isn't great at the moment, it has nothing
to do with EQ. Actually, as far as I'm concerned, EQ has made a hellovalot
of crap in my life much *less* crappy. I look forward to it. I look forward
with anticipation, wondering what might happen that particular session. EQ
has added much to my life, and has filled a hole that was quite dark and
deep.

On the other hand, DAoC has done diddly. I tried it. I created all kinds of
characters, played them all for awhile, got disgusted, dis-interested, left.
I still have the game installed (and really need to take it off to free up
wasted disk space), but would no more think of firing it up now than I would
have before it even came out. I have 0 interest in it.

Sorry, OT there. I was just wondering if you might clarify your feelings a
bit?
