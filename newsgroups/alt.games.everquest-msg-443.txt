I am a Ranger of 51 almost 52 seasons of service to Tunare. With regards to
respect I just have to say that if you are receiving none, I doubt it is you
characters class, and more in the lvl of class in your character. I agree
with the bow aspect, but post 50 our archery skills come out ( discipline
trueshot ).  I must be in the 33% because I see nothing broken.

True statement unless you are kiting.

Clerics and Enchanters are almost required in any group above 40 ( some may
say lower   40 is not exact, just there for example purposes )    Will a
ranger beat out one of these 2 classes when there is one spot left in a
group?   No.      Other classes?   more than likely it will be first-come
first-serve.    The only time I have been unable to find a group was when 1)
the group had one spot open and was saving for a cleric/chanter  2) group
was full

Agreed, but look into the discipline areas again.

Lowest damage output?  I once dueled a warrior my same lvl. We agreed swords
only. ( I would not use bow nor magic )  After one minute had gone by, we
were BOTH at 20% health. Knowing that a warrior has more hp that a ranger, i
clearly did more damage.

Well thought out. That would be very nice.

The best advice I can give is to get a Tolan Darkwood bracer.  It summons
arrrows for *free*  ( after lvl 45 ) Your only cost is the 8-9k for bracer
and the time it takes to summon 60 arrows for one mob. (  try summoning
after each mob while you are medding )  saves a ton of time.

In a realistic environment, vertical distances would not matter too much but
then you would have to take into account gravity. Also this can lead to
misuse of "advantage spots"  i.e  you can shoot mob, but it cannot hit you.
knowing verant, this would be messy in the long run.   best to let sleeping
dogs lie.

Fletching would be a nice class only skill.

Nothing to be said about that last paragraph.  Just want to keep it separate
from last paragraph

I think this is more of a wish of the non-hybrid classes as opposed to the
hybrid classes. While it is true that a ranger ( or any hybrid )  lowers the
amount of xp gained for a group. The percent lost by each person in a full
group is  [ mob xp - penalty divided by 6]  What does that mean?   a post 45
group with a ranger will have to kill 10-25 more mobs to gain the same xp as
a non hybrid group.



As a post msg note. This is not meant as a flame, but rather just another
way to view your experiences. This will no doubt draw alot of responses.
Take care all, I hope to see you around Karnor.
