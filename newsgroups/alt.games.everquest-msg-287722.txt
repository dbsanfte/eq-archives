Additional test.

Got a crude defiant club, which is 4 damage but has a 1 magic damage in 
addition.  Gave it to the pet, knowing that the pets native damage of 12 
would beat that of either the weapon (max hit 8 based on 4 damage) or 
the weapon with its magic bonus (max hit 10 based on 4+1 damage).

I hoped that the Magic damage of 1 would beat the pets native magic 
damage of 0, so he'd do max hits of 14... but no, he still did max of 12

Since I'd had the theory that even high end pets could be boosted a 
little by using this sort of trick, I'm saddened to report that it 
didn't work out.
