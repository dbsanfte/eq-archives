Derk/Dark Deathsinger or whoever is for the bards' mail delivery quests and
nothing else.  He's about level 30 and easy to kill but has a long respawn time
so it's not worth it to kill him for experience.

Very rarely some "noble hunters" will spawn in front of Guk.  They're between
level 8 and 15 and can really mess with newbie trolls hunting froglok
fishermen.  They are good race NPCs; there's a dwarf rogue, erudite & high elf
paladins, female human ranger (tough one), and a human male cleric.  Their sole
purpose is to drop Noble's Crests for the first part of the Ogre Warrior
"Nork's Severed Arm" quest.  Turning in the crest gives a crude stein for a
reward and advances the quest.  Trolls can do this quest if they get to amiable
with Craknek Warriors by turning in about 40 lizard tails to one of the guys in
the Ogre warrior guild (I forget which one).

Those are the only good race NPCs that I know of in innothule, but I haven't
hung out there in a while.
