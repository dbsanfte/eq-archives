I'd say PS2 for two reasons.  First off, it has the largest library
out there and secondly, Grand Theft Auto 3 (and GTA:Vice City) is
probably the best single player game I've played in 10 years.

Vice City is the stronger of the two games, but just plain old GTA3 is
pretty fucking phenomenal.
 
That said, I don't think you could go wrong buying any of the three
systems out right now.  The three way competition is a very, very good
thing for the consumer right now.
