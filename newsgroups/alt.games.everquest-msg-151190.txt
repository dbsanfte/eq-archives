  I'd say "good idea".  We can change careers in real life, why not in
EQ?  Yes, make it a quest so people can't go warrior solo, die, rez as a
cleric, then port to town to sell as a druid.  Make there be a
substantial loss of level.... but not as substantial as rerolling.
   It won't happen, but I think it would be a good thing.

Annie <--- Would probably be switching jobs every week, if she could. 
Even though she's happy as a cleric.
