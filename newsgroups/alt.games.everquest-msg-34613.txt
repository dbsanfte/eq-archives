Yeah, 2 groups of tank heavy fairly low-level (low 50s) folks.  The one time
I did it we had 3 lowish level groups and we just DECIMATED the guy...dead
within 30 seconds.

On Zeb I've heard of him being up quite often, and apparently no big need to
rush over and kill him immediately.  After all, the ubers snub druids and
rangers, so you don't have to compete with them. ;)
