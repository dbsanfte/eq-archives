Basically you need to cover all the bases:

1) Damage Output
2) Pulling
3) Crowd Control
4) Healing
5) Stun
6) Tanking


1) is critical. You aren't going to be able to go much of anywhere 
without any dps.

2 and/or 3) is critical if you want to do anything more interesting than 
hunt wanderers and yard trash in outdoor zones. You need at least one of 
these, and preferabbly both.

4) Critical if your playing a melee. Less so if your playing with pure 
casters.

5) Very handy for handling casters. Without some sort of stun you'll 
have a very rought time with cheal mobs, and heavy nukers in particular.

6) Last (and least for duos), if you can get some tanking ability, great.

 From this there are several good duos:

Mage / Enchanter (excellent damage, fantastic pulling, cc, solid stun. 
Modest tanking via pet/charm. No healing, but little need for it.

Shaman/Monk (great damage, pulling, modest cc, decent healing and stun, 
modest tanking)

Paladin/Bard (adequate damage, great pulling and cc, fantastic stun, 
adequate healing, solid tanking)

Shadowknight/Cleric (solid damage, great pulling, weak cc but offset by 
great pulling, fantastic healing, solid stun, solid tanking)
Many others...
...
Your proposal... Druid / BL ... I honestly don't know. You've got 
fantastic damage output, solid healing & stun, pet tanking... but I 
really don't know what you've got for pulling and/or cc I know you've 
got some lull spells, and root available with these classes but I'm not 
personally sure how well that works. You'll be very effective outdoors, 
but you might be really limited in where you can hunt in terms of 
dungeons and camps etc.
