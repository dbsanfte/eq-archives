They changed the log file naming format. Whereas your log file name
used to be named eqlog_Charname_XX.txt with XX being a server specific
two-digit number, now it is named eqlog_Charname_servername.txt.

I don't remember seeing anything about this in the patch message, either.

Rather than renaming the existing log files as part of that patch,
the client simply started writing the new files. So you'll have to 
append the new log file to the old one then rename the old to the
new to get them together.
