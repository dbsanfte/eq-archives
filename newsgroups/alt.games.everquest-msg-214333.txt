It's been a while since I've done this and I'll state beforehand, it
IS a bit risky :), but it's the fastest way I've found to raise Bind
Wound for a melee class without help.

I'm sure every EQ player has been horrified at one time or another
when they suddenly realize that the agonizing sound they are hearing
is themselves drowning and their respective HPs plummeting almost as
fast as they did on that first day of play, before they learned how to
turn off the "a=auto attack" key and inadvertently took a swing at the
helpless looking female NPC while trying to talk to her. Well, you can
use this to get your health down low enough to work on bandaging over
and over and raise the skill very quickly. 

No matter what your HP total is, and no matter what your Stamina is,
once you run out of air everyone dies in the same amount of time. I
believe the number is 8 ticks, again it's been a while, but your HPs
decrease by a percentage once you begin to drown and if timed right
you can get your HPs down below 50% where you can practice the bind
wound skill.

The trick is finding a body of water where the bottom falls away
gradually. Walk out until you're over your head, then turn and face
the shore. Move back toward shore until the water line is visible in
the top of your screen, that way as soon as you move forward again
your head will be out of the water and you can breath again. Watch
your remaining air, as soon as the meter disappears you will hear your
first drowning "glug" ;). From full health I would move forward after
the sixth tick until you get used to it. I used to push it to 7, but
that adds quite a bit to the risk of dying due to distractions. The
BIGGEST risk is "Sony's Law". You know, the one that says the worst
time to go LD is the time you WILL go LD. Once you reach 50% health,
go back in the water and repeat, but remember you're not at full
health, you'll only want to stay under for 3 or 4 ticks or so, you'll
develop a feel for it.

In the beginning I would suggest finding a friendly mage to summon as
many bandages as you can hold. You'll more than likely use them all
and then some. Then again, now that I've written all this out, I'm
probably one of the few crazy enough to do this just to get a few
points in a skill. :) Obviously, the more HPs you have the more
practices you get in before you have to gulp more water, but that
usually means higher lvl and a higher potential risk of exp loss.
