Due to a nasty virus (may it's originators have their entrails gnawed
out by goblins who like to play with their food), which resulted in
having a new HD installed, I did a clean installation of EQ. After
roughly four hours of patches I checked on my characters to see if they
were still there. They were but all their hot keys were gone! Is this
normal or is it a glitch?

Cheers Watchman :)
