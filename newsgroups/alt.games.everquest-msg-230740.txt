My cleric does a LOT of LDON groups and found that some tanks are much better
equipped than others, and it makes a *huge* difference on my mana.  
My ranger has also been in groups where she's played *exactly* the same way and
found that she can't lose agro in one group and can't *get* agro in the very
next one, (same approximate levels in the group, 57, different players.)  
On those situations where I keep *getting* agro I change to my slow crappy
weapons, wait longer to debuff and snare,  and notice that the mobs come off on
the casters *much* more often.  Are these tanks *not* taunting?  They say they
are.  Do they have really crappy weapons?  I've never had the nerve to ask.
