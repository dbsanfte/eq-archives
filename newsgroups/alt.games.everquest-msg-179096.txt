Nope. Just this morning my Enchanter is sitting in the North Freeport bank
meditating up to make some viscus mana on my XP machine. I'm playing around
with my druid on my Win 98 SE machine. I look back to check my mana and I'm
back on the desktop, so it's not just the Bazaar, and that really has me
worried. It could happen in any zone, and in the middle of a fight, unless a
certain amount of inactivity has something to do with it.
