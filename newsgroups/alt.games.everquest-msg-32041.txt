I see a bit of a difference here.

In eq you agree to abide by a code of conduct before
entering.  If that code is unacceptable, don't play.

In real life, you are never given that option, and so
have to decide the thornier issue of whether to blindly
follow laws derived from the puritanical mores of the
founders, or take the risk of being caught and punished
to live the way you choose.
