Yes, but why were they not charged with murder or
assault... why make up new laws to charge them
with?

Why not?

The victim is just as dead. Why not charge them
both with murder, and have sentencing guidelines
to differentiate?

You should be held accountable not only for what
you, but also why you did it.

To voice the message that society finds it

Any reply to this one?

No, he doesn't.

No, they don't have to prove hate just against the
victim, they have to prove hate against a
particular group of people.

Its not irrelevant.

Yes, but is he guilty of a hate crime?

He may also be found guilty of murder, but not
guilty of the other.

They should be voting according to the evidence,
not on their own prejudices. That they do vote on
their prejudices, is not unique to hate crimes.

Of course you do, thats why the legislation has
been brought in.

I don't see what you are getting at.

Are you saying that pedophiles do not have enough
protection under the law?

I don't think it has anything to do with being
able to protect yourself.

I do think it has something to do with actions
that society finds abhorrent.

Does anyone?

I agree. 

And, they should serve longer in jail because of
it, don't you think?

I agree.
