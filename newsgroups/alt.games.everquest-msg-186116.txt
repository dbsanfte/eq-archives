It's funny.... a friend of mine and I started EQ around the same time
this past June 2002, I actually made a return after a 6 month leave. I
have a 53 monk and a mid 40's druid and got and enchanter to 22 in the
last week. I also got a 6 cleric (froggy). My friend has 2 char 60+
and a druid high 40's and a chanter going to break 40 shortly.

When I log on I enjoy the social aspect of the game. I sit, chit chat,
goof around and such and explore... that is my biggest thing. I love
going to new zones and seeing what they have to offer, and of course
to fill out my "zones I've died in" list. I don't jump to the exp
heavy spots and such, if I get exp one night I do, if not I don't. It
doesn't matter. You have to have fun with it, and fun is greater then
anything else.

As I said I have a 6 froggy cleric. Made her the day LOY came out.
What a feeling. Logging in on my new cleric and the zone is like 150+
people.. err frogs hopping all over the place doing the newbie quests.
Head to West Freeport and the sight was amazing... the zone was alive
again, man.... I would have been happy to have gotten my hands on 2 "A
Large Rat"'s in a row. East Commons where the same way. I had 3 other
friends make froggies also, and we ended up picking another two up in
EC and we went to Blackburrow. It was an awsome time!! I never felt
more like a newb in my life, we didn't twink out our chars, much
anyway, and we everyone had a blast.

Its weird, you think to yourself, this game is getting to easy for the
new people coming in, the new subscribers and such. Maybe it's because
we now what it was like when we started out. Maybe it's because we
know that the new comers could quite possibly never get to  feel that
excitment, fear, hair rising up making that first run through Kithikor
Forest, Not getting to see the beauty of the Karanas, the mystic
waters of Lake of Ill Omen, or any of that. 

Just the other day I helped someone in Paineel. They were totally
lost. Not a clue in the world. Had no clue about the inner city ports,
or even how to get out of the city. So I spent the next 1/2 hour
showing him around and helping him out. And it felt awsome. After
talking with him. He had Kunark, he had Velious, and he even had
Luclin and Planes of Power. Did the new interface help him? Nope. Did
the POK books help him? Nope. None of these features helped him out.

I think alot of us forget, that although there are a lot of "new,
cool" features that they are brining into the game. They do SFA for
actually showing them HOW to play the game.
