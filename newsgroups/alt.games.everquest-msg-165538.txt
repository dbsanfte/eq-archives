I am wondering if I can get some suggestions on where I should be in
terms of equipment? My monk is currently level 46. I have put a link
to my profile and if you don't mind taking some time to take a quick
glance, I would appreciate some pros and cons to what I have.

Just a note, I am planning on replacing the Finely Crafted Velium Ring
with another Velium Fire Wedding Ring and the Cougar Claw Earring with
another Black Sapphire Electrum Earring.

Also I have toyed with the Idea of using the Horns of Disciple instead
of the Trance stick, but keep it for 1hb skill.

Thanks
Nightshade
