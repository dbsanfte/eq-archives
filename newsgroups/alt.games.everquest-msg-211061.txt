At the highend game with a boatload of AA you can get it down to like 36 
minutes and it does over 8k damage.  This is an innate ability that doesn't 
require expensive gear.

LoH still remains a gimick as far as I know.  The times I've grouped with 
pallies and they actually use it are few and far between.  I did notice a 
mob in Sol C use it a couple days ago though.  Bastard.
