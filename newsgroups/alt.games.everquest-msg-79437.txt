Ummm, I'll give you a hint, as a bard, I travel by land more than any 
other class in the game.  As a personal playstyle I also travel very, very 
extensively.  While my guild was learning ToV, I was daily running from 
Kael to ToV, which involves travel across the water in Cobalt Scar.  I 
have my swim skill damn close to maxxed, as does everyone in my guild.  
(We owned pre-nerf Siren's Grotto, and learning to single pull the Temple 
was where we really became a tight unit.)  
I have a song, Selos Song of Travel, which gives me selos speed, levitate, 
and invis.  I use it to travel almost everywhere.  With it on, I run above 
the water, so I can accurately judge my speed relative to someone 
swimming.  In every single case, I run MUCH FASTER THAN PEOPLE SWIM.  
Since we're on different servers, why don't you try a little experiement.  
Go to North Karana or something and swim from bridge to bridge.  Time it.  
Then get levitate and run the same distance.  If you don't swim it at 
least 2 and a half times faster than you run it, you don't swim faster 
than a bard runs.  With my drums of the beast I run 158% faster than 
normal run speed.  (This is the maximum run speed in the game, and Verant 
had to put a coding exception in because the drums actually boosted the 
speed beyond the hard limit.)  To put 158% faster in perspective, if 
normal running speed is 10mph, then bard with selos runs at 25.8mph.  So 
if it takes you 3 minutes to swim it, it had better take you AT LEAST 7:45 
to run it, or you are wrong.  Please, log it, hit loc at the start and 
stop of each run, and post your results.
