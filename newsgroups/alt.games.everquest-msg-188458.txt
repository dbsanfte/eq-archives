If you're interested in the quest, I've found Qeynos faction to be among the
easiest to keep up. I've gone from indiff, to dubious, to warmly, back to
dubious, and back up to kindly. If there is ever any doubt, I just go AoE
for a brief time in Blackburrow, and that seems to fix things. You can AoE
the bandits in WK or in Lake Rathe (right as you go to zone into Rathe
Mountains) and keep their sashes for turn ins in Qeynos. The hits for
corrupt seem to not be as much, so I'm just a tad week there, but there are
several easy quests for that too.
