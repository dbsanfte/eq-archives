Yes, yes, us clerics must never think about money.  Shame on us.  We must
never complain when we burn our plat on reagents for Symbol symbols.  Our
time is worth nothing.  The only reason us cleric players bought the game
was to do customer service for other players.  We must never pay attention
to the druids that charge for their ports and SoWs, wizards that charge for
their translocates, or the chanters that charge for their breeze/clarity,
jazzing plat bars, or selling crafted items for far more than what it cost
them in components.

Last night in talking to people that actually play clerics (some of whom
were the same ones that gave the above advice for making money as a cleric),
their points are as follows:

1) The XP rez is the clerics' ONLY service they can sell to other players
and that people are willing to pay for.  We also get this very late in the
game in comparison to sellable services of druids, wizards, and chanters.
It is the VERY rare person that ever pays more than the cost of a Symbol
spell.

2) Being a cleric is expensive.  We need not only spells, but armor and
reagents for spells.  Does anyone give us a break when we try to buy
something because we're clerics?  Nope.  Just the opposite if anything.  All
players assume us XP-rez-capable clerics are loaded with plat.

3) Players are stupid and die all the time.  Everywhere and every imaginable
way.  As a XP-rez-capable cleric, all clerics have told me that at times
I'll get flooded with requests for rezzes if I'm not in /role or /ANON.
Both from the players that die and those in their group and even their
guild.  In some zones, I could supposedly spend my entire time simply
rezzing and medding to rez without a moment's pause in between.  Forget
trying to get XP or loot.

4) Because Verant doesn't make a fair auto-split, tanks get the plat from
loots and clerics get copper.  Groups also whine and complain if the cleric
takes any time away from medding, such as looting.  There's logic there.
Self-centered logic there, but still logic.  Clerics determine the rate of
combat thus rate of XP and loot thus if I'm not medding, I'm slowing the
group down.

Given the above, these higher-level clerics tell me to go /role and /ANON
when playing in a group.  It will cut down on the message traffic I have to
deal with during combat.  And to do it whenever I don't want to be bothered
or don't have the time to spare.  However, going /role or /ANON will not
eliminate rez pleas entirely, because guildies will know what you are and
people who knew what you were in a past group will remember you and send
tells asking for rezzes.

Clerics that don't /role and /ANON tell me that if I don't want to hide my
class, I have to be willing to turn down people and be ready to hear the
pleas and abuse.  Players that put you down because you don't rez anyone
that asks for a rez thus you're "obviously" not playing a true "helping"
cleric.  Ones that argue how little it takes up of your time and never think
of how many ask for rezzes or how it slows down your group or how boring it
is to rez people.  And they say expect the abuse when you refuse to spend
your time (and your group's time) rezzing people but then do a rez for
someone that is offering an unbelievable amount of money for a rez.  Expect
to even get bitching from the person that's paying that amount as they might
have been one that had asked for a free rez earlier.  Expect players
(especially those with tracking) to first drag their or a group member's
corpse to you then ask for a rez and sit there until you give them one.  One
cleric thought that was presumptuous of a ranger and still refused to give a
rez.  The ranger didn't leave.  When the cleric turned to view a combat that
was out of his view, the ranger moved himself and his corpse into that
cleric's view again.  Nothing the cleric or her group could say could get
the ranger to leave.  It finally took a GM to get the ranger to move on.

When asking them how to make money off of XP rezzes, the cleric players last
night said that the previous advice is one way.  I'll get flak if people
realize I'm doing it this way.  Though they said most players won't have a
clue I'm doing it since I'm /role or /anon and am only replying to rez
requests with tells and not advertising myself.  Some said that I should
expand out my criteria to those offering to donate and to expect a wide
range of donations, from a "Oops, I forgot I didn't have any money on my
corpse." to hundreds of plat.

All said not to advertise that I'm willing to rez for X amount of plat or
even donations.  You only get abuse from zones when you do this and this
doesn't stop the beggars from pestering you.  Both in /ooc and /shouts and
in private tells.  Also there are clerics that will think you're not being a
"good" cleric and thus undercut you and offer to rez people for free in that
zone.  Besides, no one willing to donate for a plat keeps that fact silent.

Also if I do play "The Doctor's In", that I should grab a book and read
while I wait for patients.  Do my bills.  Write letters.  Talk to friends
and family on the phone.  Treat it as simply a very low paying job and don't
sweat it too much.  Glance at the screen every few minutes or paragraph read
or written.  To relax and see how I like being a doctor.  Not to do it when
I actually want to play the game but when I can juggle it in addition to
something else.  Also that Lake of Rathe is a good place to do this and to
locate myself away from people so my message board only really shows /ooc's
and /shouts and not what people are doing and saying around me.

Now what I plan to do as soon as I hit 39th is go hunting and questing for
WIS gear to get my wisdom finally to 200.  I've got a nice list of things
that should enable me to do that.  I do plan to do this in /role and, as I
travel through and hunt in zones, I plan to only respond to rez requests
that at least offer to donate, if not specify a specific amount.  I value my
time and didn't buy this game to be one of Verant's unpaid customer service
representatives.  Once I get my wisdom to 200, I plan to start grouping
again for XP and work my behind off to get to 49th.  While leveling, I'll
probably still remain in /role to cut down on the message traffic during
combat as I have a slow reading speed.  If I see someone offering to donate
for a rez while I'm grouped, I will weigh how much that will inconvenience
my group.  If I'm in a fast-pulling group, I probably won't respond unless I
like the person asking for the rez or their offering some ridiculous amount.
If I'm in a slow group, I'll send the donating person a tell that I'll rez
them if they drag their body to me and then patiently wait until I have a
break in play whereupon I'll rez them.  If they then don't pay when they
said they would or not at all if they were going to "donate", I'll simply
put them on my No Rez list and never rez them again ... nor group with them
either.  I cannot see me ever traveling to another zone (saying I'm not
camped right next to the zone line to it) without being offered a lot of
money or it being a guildmember that has arranged two-way transportation ...
and even then I better be in a slow group.  Again, I didn't buy the game to
play customer service anymore than the warrior player did.

After saying all this, do I consider myself a "good" cleric.  Yes.  I help
out people a lot.  When sitting some place waiting for something or other, I
commonly buff people while I wait.  I enjoy doing drive-by buffs.  I'll stop
for a few minutes when running through a newbie zone and give my best buffs
to the newbies for the simple joy of making their day.  When I replace old
gear with better, I commonly give the old stuff away to low-level clerics
that I happen to come across in my travels.  I have never yet sold a single
piece of gear to another player.  NPC merchants, yes.  Players, no.  That I
also want to make money as druids and chanters do, I think that's just fine.
The more money I get, the better gear I can buy thus wear, the better asset
I am to the group I'm in.  In a way, I consider myself a battle cleric ...
minus melee and nukes.  My character is here to engage and fight evil.  He's
not here to do social work.
