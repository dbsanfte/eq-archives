No, the writs increase in complexity as your guild level increases.
Further, the simple solution of having LOW LEVEL guild members do the
writs -- which gives them personal XP, personal status, and helps the
guild -- evidently never occurred to him.

At 15th level, most of the writ mobs are still green, blue, or yellow
to me. I fully expect that as the guild levels both personally and as
a guild, better writs will become available.
