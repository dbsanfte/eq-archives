I have been trying to find out if this will work with all skins or
not?  Though the directions that came with my UI say you need to
replicate the default folder into your custom folder, then unzip the
custom UI in the folder, it would make life much easier to simply have
the customer files in the custom folder.  Also, the new /loadskin does
not seem to work with the UI I use, I still have to do the whole cmd
line thing, /loadskin myui 1......and I've been to lazy for
experimentation :)   Maybe I'll give it a shot next time Verant breaks
it.         I'm running the Abattior skin in case anyone knows the
answers.....
