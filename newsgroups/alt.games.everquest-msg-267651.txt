They are online games the have servers for and support... they aren't 
really massive in that you only have a few players online at once.

Those games are what you get for the $5 station pass, or added into the 
$22 all access pass.

All I'm saying is they seem content to have some things that likely 
don't make very much money at all in a 'holding' pattern.

(I played Tantarus once... it wasn't all that bad for a cheap game)

They don't even make any money on sales... you just pay $5, download it 
and go.
