    At lower levels, when they could/should be in meleeing, they don't have
access to Jaundiced Bone gear. In the mid 40's to low 50's, they in
particular don't have access to the Jaundiced Bone Bracer, one of the best
DPS supplements around for a shaman of that level. It's obviously not as bad
as the poster made out - they won't get "owned" by a long shot, not in
modern Bazaar gear. But it will get tedious. My shaman is a troll (same
regen), and compared with other solo classes I have her levelling is
glacially slow.
