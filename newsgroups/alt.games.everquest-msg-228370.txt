Some may say I was stupid, but I am relativly new to the game and all its
faction stuff.

While in South karana, killed someone called Valhalen nostrolo?? Only killed
him twice, I believe.

Then after collecting all the splitpaw hides for a quest of gem inlaid
gloves? I made my way to Queynos, first time there too.

Met a quick attack from some bards?

Looked at allakazam and now I know I have bad faction with bards, all look
at me threatningly...BTW im only 32 druid.

Cant even do any postal quests, cos as soon as I venture near any bards, I
get attacked, already nearly died at the hands of Silna Songsmith?? in RV.

So, will I ever be able to boost faction back up, and if so, how,?

Thanks, I dont want to die when I visit towns...
