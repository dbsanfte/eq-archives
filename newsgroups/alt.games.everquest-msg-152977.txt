Some motherboards have very strict requirements about which memory slots you 
can use.  It's getting to be less so, but ASUS boards, for the longest time, 
you could only use memory in pairs.  Your motherboard manual -should- mention 
it if that's the case here.  You might also see if anyone else has noticed 
that effect on a message board for the particular motherboard.

I know trying to use three slots always seemed to be the most likely trouble 
combination.
