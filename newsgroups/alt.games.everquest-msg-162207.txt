> Sadly Olaf, that's life in the big city :(

Sorry, but "that's life in the big city" doesn't cut it in this situation.
That reasoning leaves the door open for every prick that comes along to do
the same thing.

If it happened to you; after the name you chose was on several friends
lists, after two years of building an in-game reputation, after 58 levels of
people associating your adventuring skills with that name, would you still
feel it was "life in the big city" ? Or would you feel the need to raise the
bullshit flag?
