I had a strange last night.
I took the boat from FV.  When I zoned (from FV, not into Freeport), I was
no longer on the boat but on an island.
Fortunately, the only other player on that island (he called it Chessboard
Island) was a  wizard, and he sent me on to West Commons.
Is this a new bug, and if the wiz hadn't been there, how was I to get back
where I wanted to be?
