Narrgh, make me redo calculations....

2wis earrings at level 31 = 74(.4) mana each...
3wis earrings at level 31 = 80(.6) mana each...

so the 2wis are better than 10 mana at level 5... ( 2wis = 12 mana at level
5, 9(.6) at 4 )
and the 3wis are better than 10mana at level 4... ( 3wis = 10(.4) mana at
level 4, 7(.8) at 3 )

Hmm... I'm just following the formulae other people post, so if they are
wrong, don't flame me...
