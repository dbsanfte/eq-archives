It can keep summoning you with no useage of mana.  Generally any mob that 
has more than 4% damage (and can summon) will keep summoning whoever is top 
of the aggro list.  Even if you never did anything but get proximity aggro. 
As far as Eldrig goes, it depends on your level and equipage.  If you are 56 
then probably not, but some could.  If you are 65 then you probably could.
