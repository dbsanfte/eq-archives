Yes, I do. I've played nearly 4 years on well approaching 50 different
characters now. I've researched my classes. Yes, I take cheap shots at
uber guilds, too. Why? Because 90% of those that I've dealt with in
any instance have been guilds full of whiney spoiled kids who have
nothing in their life besides Everquest and are obsessed with the idea
that the game is not only a competition, but a cutthroat one at that.

In my experience, mature uber guilds are a rarity (but they do exist).

And, quite frankly, there's more to the game than raiding. If you
think that you can't play the game without the raid interface, then
you're the one who's missing out... It didn't "force" anyone to do
jack shit. Honestly, the #1 reason I've heard people say they bought
PoP for wasn't the raid tool, anyway. Five words: Free ports for all
classes.
