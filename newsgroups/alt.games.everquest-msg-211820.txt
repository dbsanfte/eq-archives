Within reason, it is.  Anyone can take anything too far, of course ... but I
know lots of folks who are "true believers" in one thing or another, and
they're pretty well adjusted people.  Their belief system is just different
from mine ... and that's okay, provided they don't try to impose their
belief system on me.

IMO, there's a difference between 'true believer' and 'religious zealot'.
It's the latter that should be watched carefully.
