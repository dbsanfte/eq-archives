    Lemme go looking for a sec....

    Ok, not yet made. But, going on the pattern from other stuff, I'm
guessing AC 28 STR 9 DEX 3 WIS 7 AGI 9 HP/MANA 60 MR 15. So yeah, better.

    Now you know why elemental smithing is the suck. At least you need
liquefied earths - the other temper component is rarer.

    The pyramid where you do the mud ring. They should be up even when the
ring is down.

    There is none. There's just the price charged in The Bazaar. ;-) If you
see a price over 1500 pp, keep looking. You should be able to get some for
lower if you're patient.

    I believe he's in the field with all the other nameds. That's the
direction he's always pulled from, anyways.

    He has a 125 HP earring? What loot listing gave you that information?
And trust me, if you can pull him out of that field, he's going down. When
he gets pulled to our raid, if I blink I miss him dying.

    But, but, they're tradeskill trees! Must, kill, trees! (I'm also hoping
to spawn the named tree that pops off the trees near zone-in and get the CLR
earring that upgrades Solstice.)

> Where does the froggy pop?

    Go left from zone-in, and down the hill. There's a bunch of frogs in
that plains area, and he pops from one of them. Other nameds I can remember:
Tribal Leader D pops somewhere between Mud and Vines. The rock guy with the
Earthtoned Band spawns on the side of Rock facing Mud. The named mephit guy
spawns in a spot behind where the gator is. The Prismatic Basilisk pops
somewhere between Rock and Mud, based on where I've seen him pulled from.
The named gem golem with the rogue swarm pet spawns in the geonid caverns,
as a trap mob just before you go down into the big round room.

    There was one night, back when they were trying to "fix" PoEarth-A, when
the mini-nameds would pop like every other spawn. And we happened to be
clearing Earth-A that night. ;-)
