Exactly. But you don't have access to the code in a MMORPG. Your
opponent would probably call you a cheat and leave.

In a MMORPG you have no choice, they are enforced. EBaying goes on
outside of the game.

It's not the transfer of the sword that is prohibited, it's the use of
eBay to pay real money for it.

*whoosh* That was my point going over your head.

Yes, and that other person no longer has it. That's called player
economy 101.

Please drop the failed real-world analogies, they make you look
stupid.

It affects that particular player's experience, yes. But so it would
have if there had been no 20 bucks, but just in-game gold that was
handed over.
