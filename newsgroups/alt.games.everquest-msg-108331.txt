This may be true for Druids, but I assure you a Ranger can track someone,
invisible or not- I've done it several times when crossing a nasty zone
while my group was invisible, in order to keep tabs on my hunting partners.
As a matter of fact, the only time I see track not working very well is in a
high lag zone, where the updates may be inaccurate.
Maybe there is a big difference in class skills- not sure, but I've not seen
tracking of mobs or players as troublesome.
