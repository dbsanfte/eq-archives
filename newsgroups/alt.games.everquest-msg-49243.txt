That funny thing is, in the vast majority of your posts you
claim that someone is an idiot and that you are dispensing 
your own brand of verbal justice.  I expected no less of you
this time around.  In fact, you're so predictable it's both
pathetic and amusing.  You're like that sad little Gnoll 
Pup that always attacks you in the back when you sit
down to med.
