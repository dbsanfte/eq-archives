The herbs to make one sow cost just over 5.5pp.  At level 45, with alchemy
not maxxed, around 80 I believe, I fail at making potions around one out of
40 attempts.  I always carry a few around with me, as they are a handy way
to raise cash, it is the only trade skill I have made a profit with, and it
has far more than paid for the expense of raising it.  It has also paid for
getting my smithing to 175.  I started making sow potions at around level 29
or 30, and selling them for 100pp would about break even.  I now sell them
for 90 to 95pp which still gives me a nice profit.
