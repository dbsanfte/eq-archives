Rather than making a list, let me give a MASSIVE general category--1hs
items of lesser quality than the Centi Longsword. It's got a ratio of
less than 2, adds 8 str and sta, and drops far more reliably off of
yard trash in Akheva ruins than current multi-K items like the
Lamentation and Crystalline Short Sword.
