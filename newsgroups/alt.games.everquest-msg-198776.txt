Dawnshroud peaks is good 30-40, loot sucks tho. Crystal caverns is really
good
exp and good loot 30-50.

Weapons are pretty much useless for Casters so it doesn't matter
what weapon skills you have, just use the item with the best stats.
You are pretty much past your melee days. But make sure your dodge
and defense skills are maxed out.
My necro doesn't even have a weapon just hand held items for
the stats.
