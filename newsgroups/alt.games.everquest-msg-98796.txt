Take the short boat ride to Overthere. Doesn't matter if good or bad,
as soon as boat zones in, jump off and run left.  Get on shore around
the gnome npc and bind, follow ocean and zone wall to Warsilk Woods
and rebind. Now you have a whole area practically all to yourself, and
you'll never run out of stuff to kill.  Just hang around the vendor
(will sell to anyone).  The mobs will come to you, no need to even
seach most times.
