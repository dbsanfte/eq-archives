I don't know what your country of residence is, so please note that my
comments only apply within the US (with some potential to be applicable
elsewhere).

In the current political and social climate, it's always risky to make any
kind of allusion to the visitation of physical harm upon someone, and
wishing someone death is certainly that. When it happens on the Internet,
uninformed rumor mongers have the further opportunity to spin it up to new
sensational heights. And given the litigous nature of the American
community, anything that falls into the above category is potentially
actionable on a civil basis.

Having said that, there's no question in my mind that your suggestion is a
perfectly legal and socially acceptable editorial comment about a problem
that is so widespread and visible, I don't think a jury in the world would
hold you accountable for this expression. Actually, I think there's a bigger
danger of getting sued for failure to keep a promise. ;-)

Furthermore, consider this line of cross examination:

Witness:  He explicitly requested that I die and he did this in a public
forum.
Counsel: What steps did you take to protect your life after reading this
message?
Witness: Protect my life?
Counsel: Yes, you've stated that he requested that you die. Were you in
actual fear that you were really going to die?
Witness: Counselor, I have no idea what a nutcase like this is capable of
Counsel: So you took no steps to protect your life, is that right?
Witness: No, I took no specific actions to protect myself, if that's what
you mean
Counsel: If someone threatens your life and puts you in actual fear of your
life, you would take steps to protect yourself, would you not?
Witness: Of course.
Counsel: And yet in this case, you took no steps whatsoever.
Witness: Well, I didn't really think he was serious.
Counsel: Thank you, no further questions.

Let me be one of the first to join you in your editorial comment. Mr.
Spammer, please go away and die. ;-)
