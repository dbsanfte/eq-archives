I have played to level 20 in Albion and level 30 in Midgard.  I've done
quite a bit of RVR with my Thane.

As an EQer I have a level 52 Necro, level 40 Monk, level 40 Shaman and I'm
just leveling up a Beastlord (level 15 so far).

Here's the bottom line: you get a free month with DAOC.  And IT IS WORTH IT
for the price of the retail box alone.  So even if you decide to quit after
your free month you will get more than enough gameplay up til that point.

If you like MMORPGs, buy it.  Even if you don't subscribe.  Anyone who tells
you other wise is a fanbois of another MMORPG.
