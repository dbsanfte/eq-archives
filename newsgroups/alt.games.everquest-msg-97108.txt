It makes me wonder if these changes are what prompted the mini exodus
of upper level people at Verant?  

I spent a while planning my run for Velious port keys.  Made the run
from Iceclad to GD and was planning the run through Kael to WL when a
patch came along that made all my planning a waste of time.  I know in
the grand scheme it isn't a big deal but it changes the experience of
the game. I agree that it is degrading things to a lowest level.  I
wonder how long it will be before the level 10 cap on returning to
bind after death with all your stuff will get raised even higher?  

Oh well, should be interesting to see how all this unfolds.
