But in between patches...WHEEEEE!

Nothing like "oops" loot tables (which always seem to be a "bonus" for
folks that got the software on release day), and finding the pre-nerfed-
but-scheduled-for-nerf-already-after-10-people-have-one loot is GREAT!

(1) Kunark---Jade Chodaki Prod...when my friends saw that I had an
    11 damage piercer, they shit in their pants.  Nothing else mattered...
    the best, absolute uberest piercer in the game for a rogue (outside
    of GM-only FSS drops) was from Fear and was 10/22, no stats.

(2) Velious---Cougar Claw Earrings...wow, this cougar dropped 4...I can
    get FOUR whole ac on each ear, AND for my alts...or, just sell 'em for
    2kpp apiece to the folks that don't have the expansion yet

(3) Luclin---Long Sword of Ethereal Energy, Earring of Blazing Energy...
    neat-o, check out the dmg for this..and it's just my off-hander!!! No,
    seriously, my monk fights naked now...the only armor he needs is
    that ring in his ear....;-)

(4) Power---???...oooooo, not many rogues have a 30/40 piercer yet...
    but check out the backstabs!
;-)
