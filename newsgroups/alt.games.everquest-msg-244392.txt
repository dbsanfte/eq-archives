Hm,Trueshot only works for 2 minutes every 1h7m,while charm
is always available,and there is always a class around,which can
snare.
So the enchanter gets "sick" damage *all* the time,not to speak
of all the nice enc-buffs,while we get Predator as the one and only
buff that is in demand.
Enchanters were always in high demand,and now they are a dps-
class too,I see a great Imbalance there.
Do you really think,if a group has the choice,they will take the 
Ranger and turn the Enchanter down ???

Dont take me wrong,I dont want to complain or be the *best*
class,I play Ranger as main ,cause he is fun to play;when I started 
him,I was fully aware of the fact,that it is one of the weakest
classes in EQ and not in high demand for groups.
I only think its weird,that a developer has problems with Ranger-
archery-damage,while at the same time he totally ignores,what 
other classes are capable to do.
