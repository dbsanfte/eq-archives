Hi All

I approve of the Monster Mission adjustment - there's one timer for
ALL missions now, not a timer for each individual mission.  It means
no more rinse and repeat orc/fairy, lol.  Mind you, people will
probably just camp out to a new alt after each mission and cycle
through their alts.  Still, the xp appeared the same (based on doing
one mission) and an AA per mission still works out good.  I must try
it with a low-level alt to confirm the xp is the same.

The new UI looks good, but after a bit of experimentation I could find
no way to make the horizontal button bars into a bank of 2x5, as they
used to be.  Is there a way to do it?

Oh, some people report their screen res changing after logging in, but
changing it back seems to work ok.

Sadly, the new spell icons are just silly - attractive, I give you
that, mind.  Everyone is SO used to the old ones, and could see at a
glance what the buff status is. Why change it if it wasn't busted...
If they had changed the UI to show the NAME of the spell/buff, I could
see some sort of rationale for the change, but not for simply
introducing new icons just for the look.
