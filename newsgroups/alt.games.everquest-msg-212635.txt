4 groups of lvl 50. Basically try Vox / Naggy for some early raiding
experience IMO.
Aside from that you shoud try doing some of the more fun parts of the epics
to get to know raiding. CoM (mage, shammie, druid, ranger, SK part is rather
hard) is a good one for early 50's. The Hole ((mage), shaman, ranger, sk) is
pretty fun early to mid 50's.

Taking down the Kunark dragons is good for getting some rare spells and some
decent items here and there.

As mentioned before, if you want to do some gear upgrades the best place to
start would be Kael for thurgadin quest armor.
Heck my guild does NToV and can take down the AoW and I'm still walking
around in a thur quest robe (dammit).

Err if you have a good solid force, raid-experienced (they listen to
commands, know how to use clickies, got resist gear set, understand basics
of positioning), a few tactical persons, a bunch of clerics who know how a
ch-chain works (and a bunch of druids/shammies who know how to patchheal)
and a decent warrior (60+, preferably 65+ with as many aa's as possible) you
might start to think about it :).

Like a previous poster said, it's mostly the AE's that eat people up. The
first real mob you need to take down is Aaryonar. He has a nice manadrain ae
that leaves all chars hit by it manaless in a matter of seconds. So you need
to know where to pull aary, where the healers can hide, a melee that calls
the AE, keep the mob positioned so it's out of the walls (so the rangers can
shoot it) and the MT won't go out of healing range and the healers won't get
hit with the AE, etc.

Slowable, yes. Snareable, dunno. They won't run so who cares.
early or mid-50 war tanking? erm right. assuming he misteriously knows how
to keep aggro he would need at least ornate+ gear. at the least. with a
shitload of clerics in the CH chain who all have enough mana to keep a fight
going with a low-dps guild.
SK tanking ntov? could be done. I've read about a mage tanking aary. But
that was a 200+ aa mage with elem gear and a ch-chain of 2 sec keeping him
alive :)
60 sk with neglectable gear would not stand a chance I think. not unless he
has the same conditions as the warrior described above :).

As for raidtargets. check the "Tier list" used for stormhammer. it's around
on most messageboards and it was posted here on the newsgroup a couple of
days ago as well. It has a listing of old world, kunark, velious and luclin
raidtargets grouped per difficulty.
You guild should start with Tier 1, see if you can reliably take down those
mobs then try some tier 2 ones etc.
PoP raidtargets are ofcourse a bit harder but when you get to know the
raidgame a bit better you can judge for yourself if and when you can take
down certain things like TT or Grummus (to get a feeling, my guild is
currently somewhere at tier 7-8 and we needed an alliance with another guild
to take down TT. Trying for Grummus in 2 weeks probably)..
