Try making a new warrior and give him nothing.  Not one single twink 
item, let them earn their own way by the sweat of his/her brow so to 
speak.

I had little trouble soloing my warrior twink into the 50's.  He did 
have a fungie, 36% haste and the best droppable hp gear I could get 
with the plat my Necro had collecting dust in the bank.  I quit EQ 
before I could get him further, making endless alts just was not fun 
any more.
