I am noticing a distinct lack of shaman in the lists presented.  I know that
I would be more limited in the mobs I could solo without gear, but I am
quite certain, that even at my level, I can find places to solo dark blue
mobs without any gear.  Root and Rot with the ability to regenerate my mana
with Cann III and Regrowth mean that the size of my mana pool is not really
very important.  I may have to rot the mobs a bit slower, but I am quite
certain that I could still do it.
