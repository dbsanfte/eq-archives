Considering that i lost around 8 items in tradeskill container use just 
from dissapearings while going LD, there is NO way i would even consider 
using a stationary tradeskill container as a transfer unit.
Especially at the moment, where there seem to be a bug related to 
tradeskill containers (gone from 205 to 226 baking on Misty Thicket 
Picnics, and so far i got 4 more Files in my inventory than i started 
out with, NO clue how)
