Disarm is different from other melee skills.  While most weapon/melee
skills *do* require you to be fighting a mob that is high enough that
you can get exp from it (i.e., "high green", or blue-or-higher), disarm
can be raised by being practiced against ANY level mob.

I should know, when my Paladin got Disarm at level 40, he maxed the
skill mostly on Orc Pawns out in East Commonlands, which were green
to him by at least 30 levels.
