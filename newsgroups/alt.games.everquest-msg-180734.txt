Hehehe,

Just died travelling between Rivervale and HHP.
No-one told me it was unsafe before 10am....(game time)
Any other regions like this around?
I'm a lvl 22 Bard.
Damn HHP too.... if no-one else in in the zone (Happens frequently) it's
damn hard not to get killed at my level trying to travel to HHK to get my
songs.  Any hints / tips?

T.
