As I understand it, from a showeq poster, the distribution of xp is actually
based on Level+5.  So in the first group example, the numbers would actually
be:

The warrior gets (55+5)/( (55+5)+(60+5) ) or 60/(60+65), and the cleric gets
65/(60+65).  Warrior would get 48% of the total xp, cleric would get 52% of
the total xp.

It's only a slight difference at higher levels, but at low levels it serves
to distribute the xp more evenly among the players in the group.  The net
effect is that a lower level player will level faster, despite getting less
xp, as the xp required to gain each level is structured such that even with
the smaller amount of raw xp, it is a larger percentage of the xp required
for the next level.
