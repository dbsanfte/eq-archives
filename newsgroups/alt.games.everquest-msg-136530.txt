Ok help me out ... its been quite some time for me to work on number
crunching .... so what is the formula to figure out Ratio?
and how should one decide which is better for Off hand and Primary.

Is there a Excel spread sheet or some such program I can feed a few
numbers in (damage/delay/primary/offhand/ char level)
to tell me the better to use...
Yeah I have heard of copelands... but am also aware it is very dated
and may not reflect new formulas in the game system now.
