for expensive spells, I had to group where decent loot dropped. Even if you
can get some 5k item. Sell it, and repeat.  Then in about 2 weeks of a good
amound of EQ time put in you can save 20k.

Back in the day Old Seb was a good spot..  it now sucks for good priced
loot.

I got some 65 spells by getting winning rolls on ornate from BoT. I was
lucky to actually loot torpor when I was 55 from Seb though.  =)
