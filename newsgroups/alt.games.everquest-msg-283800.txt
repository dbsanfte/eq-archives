Indeed, it's obvious.

Covetous Subversion
2:  	Increase Mana by 100

Mana:  	300
Casting Time:  	3
Recast Time:  	8

100 mana every 12 seconds, at the cost of 300 mana.
So in 48 seconds, necro uses 1200 mana, cleric gains 400 mana.
In 48 seconds, cleric gets given the mana for one more cheal.

In those 48 seconds, the necro is better off killing the mob quicker so the
cleric doesn't need to cheal that one extra time.

Mind Wrack is a good spell, the many necro's will cast if and when they
can, since it gives the whole group mana.  However, for the necro it's a
net loss of 300/cast.  However, twitching is both tedious and inefficient
and if the necro doesn't want to - then you need to learn to play with
people who don't play exactly how you want.
