Just an FYI. The Jade Reaver is very easy to get compared to the shattered
emerald. In all likelihood you will have plenty of time if you have to appeal to
open newsgroups for help.

Hi everyone, I am presently working on my Ranger epic.  I need help obtaining a
Jade reaver in City of Mist.  No, I am not about to spend 10 to 20k on one since
I dont have that kind of plat.  I'm lucky if I get 1K in the bank at times but
when I do it's normally spell buying time and that deletes it even more.  So, I
am calling on those in Drinal for help with my Ranger epic.  All I want is the
jade reaver, all loot that drops can be for those that help me with this.  If
you have free time on your hand and are on the Drinal server, please send me a
tell to one of my 3 characters.  I'm looking forward to be able to get this
soon.

Thank you all in advance
