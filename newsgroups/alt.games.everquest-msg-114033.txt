Well I finally gave up EQ. It's just no fun when I keep going LD, and on top
of that get set back with experience loss, AND I'm expected to pay $12/month
for this! Look, all I'm saying is -- the internet has lag! When your modem
disconnects from the internet that's one thing, but when you are still
connected and get booted and die -- well, that's just bad game design! It's
quite possibly server overload, but who knows -- Verant hasn't even
acknowledged it as a problem!

All I'm saying is let's make a game that accounts for internet lag! It's not
going to go away! Not when most people have to go through 10 or more routes
to reach the server.

My question is will Star Wars Galaxies account for lag and not penalize us
for it, or is it going to be the same deal?
