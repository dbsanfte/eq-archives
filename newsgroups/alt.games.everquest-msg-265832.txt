    It certainly represents MYSELF as one of those people.

    But if you want NUMBERS...

Such complaints may lie behind the so-called "churn rate" faced by some
online games. "Both Ultima Online and Everquest claim to have over 125,000
users," says Greg Costikyan, a long time game designer and author of the
just-released report "The Future of Online Gaming." "On the other hand,
Ultima Online I think has sold more than 400,000 copies and Everquest about
300,000, which means the majority of the people who bought Ultima Online ...
have decided not to renew their subscriptions. So clearly churn rate is an
issue."

    Let's see... 300,000 boxes sold and 125,000 users... that means MORE
THAN ONE-HALF of the people that bought the game then QUIT THE GAME as of
the writing of this article.  I was a regular reader of the Everquest
newsgroup so I watched that implosion firsthand as well.

    And CHARTS...

RECENT CHARTS
http://pw1.netcom.com/~sirbruce2/Subscriptions2.gif

For ACTIVE SUBSCRIPTIONS (+150,000), the charts tell the story of "Lineage"
(with "Lineage 2" rocketing up quickly) actually having more paying
customers that "NeverFun" (EverQuest).  Ah, the things the kind person who
posted these charts know... that I know... and now... you also know.
http://pw1.netcom.com/~sirbruce2/Subscriptions1.gif

MMOG Active Subscriptions (scaled 0 - 120,000).  So as to highlight the
lesser game subscriptions.

(Very brutal numbers on the "Sims Online" & "Asheron's Call")


    (This is coming out, but frankly, since the play experience and customer
experience with EverQuest itself was so very non-entertaining... I will not
be even considering the purchase of "EverQuest 2".  If they want to let
incompetents like Verant run the show, then frankly I could care less about
even considering the game.)

SUBSCRIBER GROWTH IN ONLINE GAMESGAMEPLAY VERSUS COMMUNITYPopular persistent
world games have had an average life cycle of over eight years. Examples
include Air Warrior (14 years), Islands of Kesmai (16 years), Kingdom of
Drakkar (9 years), Gemstone III (13 years) and MUD II (16 years). Of the
more current successes, Ultima Online is currently in it's fifth year of
live operations, has over 200,000 subscribers and consistently had more
subscribers each year than the previous year until about June, 2001.
EverQuest reached it's two year anniversary in May 2001, has over 410,000
subscribers as of August, 2001 and appears to still be in a steady growth
trend. Asheron's Call has grown to over 100,000 subscribers this year, and
Microsoft is preparing to open the game to new markets in Asia. If these
three follow the historic trend, the life cycle of all three will be at
least five years and maybe as long as a decade.
    [end clip]

    As you can read here, that means by May 2001, EverQuest increased their
membership by 328%, but at what cost of churn?

    [continuing the clipped article]
For example, let's look at the case of the current top PW in the USA,
Sony/Verant's EverQuest, which was launched in March of 1999. In the first
twelve months after launch, the game signed about 280,000 subscribers. In
the subsequent 21 months, they added less than half that, only 130,000, in
spite of shipping three popular add-on SKUs and recording close to one
million total SKU sales. Yes, 410,000 subscribers is nothing to sneer at,
but one has to ask: why has the game retained only 41% of the 1,000,000
retail units sold to a targeted audience? What caused this remarkable slow
down?

Still others have postulated that Verant finally reached the extent of
hard-core 3D, 1 person MUD players. It is interesting to note, however, that
about March of 2000, Verant began instituting player-hostile policies such
as attempting to institute hard drive searching for cheat utilities,
'nerfing' or changing character abilities to such an extent that literally
hundreds of hours of play time for tens of thousands of subscribers was
negated, banning support for eBay auctions of characters and items by
announcing they considered that cheating, dropping message board discussions
for all but the most mundane announcements (and announcing that change with
a message that basically stated "You'll never be satisfied, anyway, so we
don't want to waste our time talking to you."), former Verant VP Brad
McQuaid stating publicly that there is only about nine months of gameplay in
EQ and if you play more than that you need to find another game, and
generally addressing the EQ community in a manner the players perceived as
dismissive, arrogant and uncaring. The churn rate on subscribers flipped at
that time, from less than 30% in the first eight months to about 60% today.

While these attitudes can be chalked up to inexperience and being a victim
to one's own success, we believe it is no coincidence that the subscriber
churn flipped 180 degrees after the above attitudes became apparent to the
community. We believe it is the major reason EQ turned from retention of
280,000 customers out of the first 400,000 American SKU purchasers to only
120,000 out of the next 600,000.
    [ending clip]


    Gee... a PROFESSIONAL ANALYST also notes that Verant was being hostile
assholes to their customers.  Imagine that.

    Granted, they were smart to note that some players will never be
satisfied with anything that any company does to attempt to please them, but
forgot that their main player base had legitimate complaints about the buggy
game design and serious gameplay issues.


    [continuing the article -- but skipping over signifigant observations
why Ultima has a better design]
SUBSCRIBER GROWTH IN ONLINE GAMES

THE PLAYER LIFECYCLE

Players change their own roles over time. Some become leaders and need tools
to help them lead their people; others become opinion makers in the
out-of-game community, while other players create roles they find
interesting for themselves. Each requires different tools and
capabilities,and it is necessary to insure that players have these tools at
the proper stage of their lifecycle; if they have them, they'll help you
increase the size and role of your game community over time.

CONFUSION:
Historically, this is where the most churn develops. New players often don't
read documentation or do online research on how to get the most of out the
game; when they enter the game for the first time, there is a natural
element of confusion. If the subscriber does not receive enough guidance and
human contact during this period, he will most often quit. If the new player
receives human guidance quickly, the chances are very good that he will
become 'hooked' and move on to the next phase.

EXCITEMENT: The player is primarily there for the game, as he now
understands how it works and how to advance within it. At this time, they
are also making personal contacts and learning more about the the game. This
phase lasts between two and four months. If the player makes sufficient
community contacts, that player will generally move on to the next phase.

INVOLVEMENT: This is the longest subscription period of the player lifecycle
and is hinged on community involvement. If the player becomes attached to an
in-game micro-community, that micro-community generally becomes involved in
the meta functions of the game, such as an ongoing story plot, holding team
events, et al. Players who move into the Involvement phase normally
subscribe to the game for a period of years. For example, it is estimated
that 60% of Ultima Online players have subscribed to the game since 1997.

BOREDOM:
At some point, all players will become bored with the game, regardless of
the strength of the community. If they cannot be recaptured through new
content or features, they generally churn out within 2 to 4 months of
Boredom setting in.
