Sorry, but just had to share this! 

2 days ago I decided since my 35 monk was in Iceclad killing cougars, I'd camp
Stormfeather for the Eyepatch of Plunder quest while I was there. Friday I was
there for about 1 hour, getting exp, then logged off. Didn't play at all on
Saturday. Today I had about 30 minutes so I decided to log in and kill a few
cougars, when I zone it.. I see wings flapping and my health bar going down! I
FD, check to see if anyone else is in the zone (mainly hoping no one is, so
that no one can take the kill from me :> ), the zone was clear, so I get back
up and follow Storm around so I don't loose him, put out a "Call of Arms" to my
guild, a level 70 wiz comes to the help, one nuke and I got the 1st map piece
for the quest. Still a good ways to go (need other 3 map pieces) and I know,
it's not cool to get help like that, but when I FD'd SF already had me at 67%
health and I had only done 5% damage to him. I was so thrilled that I lucked
upon Stormfeather which is a 19 hour spawn and is know to skip spawns only
after around 2 hours in iceclad.

As history would have it, my Ranger had the same thing happen, but she was
camped in Iceclad for 2 weeks. She was able to fear kite SF at level 36 pretty
easily, once I got the right spells loaded.
