Simple, kill Tolus and Reskin in EC, Valon and Colin in WC and stick the
boot in on Slate next time you see someone killing him. This will make you
KoS to Militia but give you Knights of Truth Faction back the fastest.
Killing orcs in the commons will also improve faction but remember the
higher level the mob/npc the larger the faction hit, it might take a lot of
orcs, if you wish to do this, sit with one of the newbie groups at an orc
camp and help them rather than holding an entire camp yourself.
Antonican Bards...ahhh well now that is different...Very hard to get that
faction back, although hunting in MM says you get an improvement...I've
spent a long time in there and did not see any improvement.
You can avoid the bards in NFP...not quite so easy in Sth Qeynos tho.
