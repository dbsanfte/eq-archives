AFAIK there is no way to macro this.

However you can drag your primary and secondary
slots and an inventory slot with a bag all over to
hotkey spaces, for ease of swapping access.

Switching out a single weapon for another is a simple
matter of getting the switch weapon on your cursor,
then a single click over your primary (or secondary)
slot swaps them so the original weapon is now on
your cursor and the new one in its slot.

Swapping primary for secondary goes

click secondary
click primary
click secondary.

I did this when trying to help train a relatively
bad weapon skill, keeping the poor skill weapon
in the offhand till my victim is running snared,
when a little extra time to kill won't matter but
I'll have more chances to increase that skill.

Swapping two one handers in for a two hander

one hander on cursor waiting
click primary
click inventory slot with second one hander
click secondary.

Swapping two hander for pair of one handers

Nothing on cursor waiting
click secondary
click inventory slot with two hander
click primary

Swapping offhand only two hander for two one handers

nothing on cursor waiting
click primary
click inventory slot with two hander
click secondary

So, all swaps are three click operations, with the
exception of the single weapon swap which is
one click... and this is why as a bard I really want
a full set of primary slot instruments.  So far
I have a wind instrument and a string instrument,
still need a primary slot drum and brass.
