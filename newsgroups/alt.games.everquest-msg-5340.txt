: They were only briefly in the game. One day a few buildings showed up in
: Qeynos hills and just outside of the walls of Qeynos city with people called
: "rude individual"s. A couple of weeks past and they became "loathsome"...Now
: thier dwellings are empty. Seems though that when they dissappeared, Qeynos
: catacombs was then infested with spectres and necromancers and some funky
: rats that I can't remember thier name(they were all blue to me at 45)...
: That's all I know, hope it helps.

  Thanks. The rats are likely the "Sepsis rats."  Its good to be Agnostic,
very few peopel want to kill me.
