As others have pointed out, Dispell Magic attacks your "lowest"
position buffs first.  Make sure you leave room at the bottom of
your buff list so that that's where the Charm will end up when it
hits you.  The easiest way is to cast a junk buff on yourself, then
all your "good" buffs, then click off (or dispell) the "junk" buff,
leaving a "hole".

Also be aware that Dispell Magic doesn't just automatically cancel
the buff it hits, it seems to instead decrease its duration by a set
amount.  If that exceeds the amount of time the buff already had left
to go, it disappears.  Otherwise, it just shortens the duration and
you'll have to cast it again (and maybe even again) until it knocks
the buff out entirely.

Also, I can't stress strongly enough the value of getting equipment
(armor pieces, jewelry, etc.) that have "+Sv Magic" stats on them.
When fighting powerful casters, it's worth sacrificing AC items
to make room for wearing MR (Magic Resist) items.  When you're
done killing casters, then just switch back to your high AC armor.

Not only will you need MR gear now for fighting Evil Eyes, but
eventually you'll REALLY need it for fighting Dragons and other
powerful creatures (as well as +Sv Cold and +Sv Fire equipment).
Start your collection now.
