I haven't come across any of the new ranger bunny shoes, but I did get
(amongst many other things, including Belt of the Holy Wanderer (now
THAT is a cool name!) after 4 hours and belts ninjaed twice from
friends trying to hold them for me) a ranger cloak last night. The
ranger that came up to it first was wondering who to give money to for
being allowed to loot... result of the damn scalping mentality and
people offering their firstborn for looting rights :/

A necromancer friend got the new 7int robe, but complains that it's
ugly and makes him a mage.
