My first to mention was running through high hold pass. I recently became a
level 36 druid and wanted to test earthquake on trains in runny eye. Upon
zoneing in I ran down the bridge and someone msg me asking "would you please
kill the giant for me?!" I said what the hay, first time for every thing. I
sent an ooc and said "Im about to solo my first Giant who wants to watch?"
Needless to say a crowd of about 20 players amassed as I rooted a Hill
Giant. Next I snared, next I immolated, and next I Drones of Doom. I ran
back to a comfortable sitting distance and watch him slowly die. Every few
minutes I would hit him again with snaring roots and just watch his life go
down. It was great and I got 44 plat out of it. Not to mention a few
cheering fans.
Savior Lanier bows to all.
Druid who will hit level 37 tonight if the servers come back up.
