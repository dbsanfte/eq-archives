That's plan A next time we hunt there, try a preset targetting hotkey.
You can actually see the spawn point from where we set up camp so that
isn't a big deal. The agro range of the stampede is low enough that
you can root the little guy in the middle of the pack without having
anything else agro on you. 

John's strategy of setting up in the pit never seems to work all that
well for our group, even with an enchanter we always seem to get
swamped by adds eventually. ... probably because we just aren't uber
enough to kill things quick enough. The tunnels are easier to pull and
you can stick to Daiku which gives you a better shot at decent loot
(highly polished gems). It's also a nice place for a shaman to pull,
mobs are spaced out and Daiku run slow enough that you I can pull with
Malos and have them (partially) slowed by the time I get back to camp.
