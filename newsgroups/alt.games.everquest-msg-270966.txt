Wrong.  If I'm grouped with someone who knows so little about
how to play his class that it ends up getting ME killed, that
certainly is an adverse affect on MY game time.  I won't tell
people how to play their class, but if they're doing things
fundamentally wrong -- like a warrior who doesn't know how to
keep aggro off the casters, or anyone who doesn't know how to
use Bind Wounds to reduce downtime -- I'll certainly offer
advice.  And if they keep doing the same stupid things despite
the advice, I may decide to look for a different group.  Alas,
finding groups is harder these days, which may be why people
are more bent out of shape about other players not knowing how
to play their class.  (Then again, I'm not sure people ARE more
bent out of shape about it; near as I can tell, there've always
been rants about it.)
