pay attention to the max damage the pet does empty-handed. If you have
a weapon that has a damage of more than half that number, hand it to
the pet (One that you can afford to do so with, that is. ;-) ).
Another good idea is if you have a cheap proc'ing weapon like a Gnoll
Hide Lariat, and your pet is high enough to proc it, go ahead and hand
it to the pet. The damage won't change, but the pet will now have a
chance to stun the mob.

Once you get the lvl 28 necro pet, always hand the pet 2 weapons
whenever you can. Somewhere in the 30's (don't recall exactly.), you
no longer have to hand the pet weapons for it to dual wield, but
between 28 (when the pet first gains the ability to dual wield) and
then, you have to hand it 2 weapons. Carry several rusty daggers
around for this...
