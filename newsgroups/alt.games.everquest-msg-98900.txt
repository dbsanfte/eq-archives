------------------------------

- Contact buffs have once again been disabled for bards to prevent songs
from locking up

- Fixed a bug that was causing the "Soandso begins to cast a spell" message
to not display

- Fixed the bug that was causing the last hit message for another player to
be displayed even if you had other's hits off

- Added more info to the /hitsmode help

- Added another option to the /hitsmode command to allow users to force the
windows to be displayed even if empty

New Hitsmode Usage: /hitsmode <my|me|other> <on|off|m2|m3|m4|m5> <X> <Y>
<COUNT> <FONTSIZE> <HEADER> <BG> <WIDTH> <FORCEDRAW>

Where: <FORCEDRAW> is 1 to force the window to draw even if empty.

- Changed it so hitsmode windows do NOT draw when in "normal" old UI mode
(e.g. spellbook)

- Fixed a bug that was giving bards an error message related to
/targetgroupbuff every time they zone. ("This ability does not work with
bard songs.")
