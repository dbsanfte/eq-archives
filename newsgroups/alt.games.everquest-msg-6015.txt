 Great! I personally run the same card, and LOVE it. :) (Though I am an AMD
fan... *g*)

Hmmmmm.... this MAY be a problem... "CURRENTLY" does this mean a lot of this
accumulates from playing the game? Or is EQ just THAT big? I think her HDD
is a 6.4GB, but she has a LOT on it....I can  probably find her a 20GB or
something, at the shows... after all... it IS spring! :)

Thanks for the info!

me a geek? lol)
