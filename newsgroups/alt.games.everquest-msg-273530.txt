ah yes.. i have been scoping that site out. I know BST up to 22, but
after that is a blank. I will probobly read all the spells and read
which ones are still used and which ones are pure crap.

The first hand me down was a ranger, which was fine because my old main
was a druid. But i never had a shamen, they where never my thing.
