Vexthal crashed, too.
BoT did 2 days running.  The only lag I noticed was zoning/logging in times,
and I do mean SLOW

Agree, sortof.. maybe..
FD currently is too powerful - the most ridiculous of pulls can be
achieved - but it does have a feature (that James made a good case for,
recently) that monks arguably need in a lot of the PoP "20000 mobs per room"
encounters

An AA ability, 6 points, 2 min refresh, should do what rogues escape skill
does (aka what current FD does)
Also, in the same way rogues Hide/sneak was made to trivialise a lot of the
"old" stuff, for another 5 AA's monks should never "fall to the ground"
again.  It doesn't trivialise encounters or make monks overpowering, it just
helps against bullshit deaths - you shouldn't be at the mercy of a random
system.

Ok ok, so I've maxed my offensive and defensive AA's and want something
new... I do think monks need the 2 above skills, in the name of class
balance (at he very least, the "not fallen to ground" one)

I've changed my mind... the new agro stuff owns.  My shaman is 200x more
powerful than hes ever been, right now =p  And chanters.

We did MM on patch day, he went down like any other day (zero deaths till
like 2%.. btw why does a paladin enrage?).  What MM problems did you guys
have?

I know, but its not perfect.  It locks the mouse now until the char select
screen.
