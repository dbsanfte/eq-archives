Ben must be pulling different mobs than us. heh.

Did levels 52 and 53 and the beginning of 54 in SF. Yes, the wurms and
some of the named can have an annoying amount of hp, but mostly we are
pulling chromos, sperm, drakes, and wyverns of both the normal and elder
variety. All are blue, and they generally barely live long enough on the
pull to bother fearing them. The biggest complaint I get is that it
takes too long to bring them back.

Errr... no... wait...

What I mean is, Ben's right. The place sucks. Don't go there.

Ever.
