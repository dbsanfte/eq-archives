Over the holidays I received a gift certificate for Best Buy. So I was just
surfing their site when I noticed what looked like a EQ dream come true. It
is called the Belkin Nostromo Speedpad and I was wondering if anyone has
this and if it would work with EQ? The one thing I hate about EQ is that you
are restricted by the keyboard. I included the link below in case anyone
wants to take a look at it.
