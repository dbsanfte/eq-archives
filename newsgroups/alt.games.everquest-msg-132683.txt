How about, he got it from his mother when he was a baby?  Since that
is how most children are aquiring HIV in Africa, either while in the
womb or while breast feeding.  I guess it doesn't put enough blame on
someone for you, but HIV is a largely blameless disease in the
developing world.  (And should be in the US, but bigotry is rearing
its ugly head.)

You're the one who can't grasp the full implications.  A child can't
grasp the full implications of death usually, but they can certainly
grasp enough of it have a basic understanding.  When a child has a
relative die due to heart disease, and they ask what happened, do you
just ignore the question because you don't think a child can fully
understand how a sedentary lifestyle, with a bad diet, and a genetic
predisposition towards heart disease led to fatty buildup in the
arteries, and overstressed the heart, with a eventual result being a
heart attack, or do you just explain that his heart was worn out, and
he lived a long life, and it was his time?

And if it were Barney we were talking about, maybe a child of 2 would
be the appropriate audience.  However, Sesame Street is aimed at a
slightly older audience, probably 3-5, which may not seem like much
but developmentally it's a HUGE difference.
