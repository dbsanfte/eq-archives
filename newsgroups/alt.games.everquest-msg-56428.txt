    How many guild slayings of Vox have you seen since the level cap was
imposed? Lower-level guilds usually have too much level spread to have the
crew to take a dragon, and if you have enough guild twinks to make up a Vox
raid you go kill a Kunark dragon instead. The guild solution does not work
for Vox.

    Don't take morons? Not always possible. You need to find people with the
right resist gear (fairly easy) in the right level range (tougher) playing
the classes needed to get the job done (moderate difficulty) who all WANT to
kill Vox *with the loot rules you are imposing* (high difficulty). Then get
them all to Perma at the appointed time, with the correct gear on them, and
organized. Assess their play skill? How? Unless you as raid leader grouped
with them all you won't know how good they are - and you very likely don't
know how they'll handle being in a raid situation.
