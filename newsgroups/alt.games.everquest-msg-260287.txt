Yes it does :-(. If you have a Pentium 4 Prescott processor in your 
system, make sure you check with your motherboard manufacturer's website 
for a revised BIOS or you may find yourself with a system that refuses 
to boot after installing SP2. There are fixes if it happens, but they 
are a royal pain in the posterior. Safer to wait for a new BIOS if 
you're in that boat.
