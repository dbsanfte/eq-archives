This is the third time this has happened.The first time with luclin I needed
to update to directx 1.8 or something.Next quite randomly it showed up again
I re-downloaded directx again and it fixed it but that isn't working.
I got a radeon that has been working fine for two or so years now .So what's
the deal?
