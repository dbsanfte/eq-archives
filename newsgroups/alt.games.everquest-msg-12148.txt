Actually, I just started fighting in Velious, and there are some weak
mobs there that should be ideal for working on defence. After getting
bound in Thurgadin I started exploring, and soon discovered the Dire
Wolves in the Great Divide. They are blue to me at 40, but they must
be very low blue, they hit very weakly for their level. I'm a warrior,
so I will have much better damage absorption than you, but fighting
them I typically got hit for 6 damage, which seemed to be the minimum,
and the hardest was under 50 points. In the time it took me to kill
one I would take about 3-400 damage. They have a tiny aggro range,
though they will aggro, and they don't seem to swarm, at least not
that I saw in a couple hours fighting. You could play around with
regen and try tanking one. Another nice, though strange, thing about
them is that they moved rather slowly, using strafing I could outrun
one without SoW. If all you are looking for is defence, faction
shouldn't be an issue, but they give positive Dragon and Dwarf
faction, and two negative giant factions.

The only hazard in the area (near the Eastern Wastes zone) was the
occasional Frost Giant, while they also were blue cons they hit for
over 100 damage on occasion, and I couldn't solo one, though I tried
several times. They also small aggro ranges, in fact one walked right
over me while I was using bind wounds.
