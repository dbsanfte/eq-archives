Has anyone noticed the "kicking" of the overnight merchants? I can leave
my character in merchant mode all day...9 hours straight...and she never
goes down.  But at night, she can't go more than 2 hours before the room
instances are mysteriously "down" and everyone is kicked out of their inn
rooms.

I'm beginning to be really suspicious that they ahve some sort of code
that says "when X people are in vendor mode, shut down the room instances
for 3 minutes". They've said that they did not do offline selling because
they want to limit the flow of goods on the market, so that same reasoning
woudl provide a motive for kicking folks out of their rooms at night.
