That's happened to me a *lot*.  Fortunately it eventually stopped, because I
was replacing no-drop equipment for other no-drop equipment.  =)  Still,
it's tough having your stuff drop in value so much, I empathize.

Hmm.  I think it is, but that's not based on anything remotely resembling
evidence.  I'm sorely tempted to roll a level 1 alt on every server and run
up to the bazaar to check on the prices of Leather Padding just to see what
it's like.  I'll probably look up the price of Heraldic armor, too, just
because I'm a smith and am wondering how my stuff gets priced on other
servers.

If I do this little experiment, I'll let you know the results.  =)
