    Key words, "prior to Velious". As in back when it was one of the few
places one COULD go to hit level 60. As you have pointed out, Skyfire
suxx0rs and it's not like people /ooc'ed "Want to form top of High Keep
group!" Today, it's my understanding that it's beginning to empty out. Velks
is too convenient.

    It's about needless risk, yes. Nobody is going to go someplace where
they may have to sit 30 mins at zone-in LFG'ing their hearts out if they
have to solo the Big Bad Mob at zone-in, especially if they're a class that
cannot solo the Big Bad Mob at zone-in. Because every time they zone in,
they have to face the prospect of nobody but the mob being on the other
side.

    This is different from having a zone-out be far from zone-in. I think
with Seb people got used to the idea of having to camp at zone-in if no
openings were around, or find a DRU/WIZ to get them out, or <gasp> make that
run to zone-out. This is step into the dungeon, Mr. Mage, and get whacked
into paste from the get-go.

    Actually, I didn't. You've listed all four points - read them again.

    No argument there.

>You can start pickup groups practically anywhere for these two zones.

    I doubt it. You have to be in a zone with a viable party LFG with at
least a porter (to get to The Feerrott, if nothing else) being one member.
In most zones I've been in, if you have a group GTG there's likely SOMEPLACE
in the dungeon where you can set up and start pulling. Likely the party
member that suggested "hey, let's go to Hate for XP and no lewt!" would get
a lot of odd stares.

    I should have been more specific. The sirens outside in CS are what I
was talking about by "guarded zone-in point". Unlike Seb, where you can
stroll to the orb and see nary a soul, it's more like Howling Stones (which
I'm surprised you didn't mention in your list).

>Instead of 3 walrusmen with damn near impossible MR
>smacking for 220+ with aggro range the moment you zone in,

    Did you encounter issues pre-change? I was only there the once, but at
level 58 or so I was not in aggro range when I zoned in and I WAS visible
(siren mishap outside with the party's druid losing camo).

    Sticking to the zone wall in TT, you'll see mobs in the distance on your
run to Seb. Maybe. So you will arrive at your XP destination with, well, all
your XP. To get to DN, you need to clear CS (wandering Wyverns etc. possible
if the kiters are slacking, sirens at SG zone), run through/Succor through
SG, then get through WW with yellow-at-60, instakill mobs wandering about.
Just to zone in and start LFGing. And you wonder why it isn't a pickup group
zone? /boggle

>Again, goes back to "too risky".

    Hell, yes. When people go to a zone to get XP, they want to, well, get
XP for the day. Not die en route because Invis dropped in the wrong place,
then spend a half hour just getting back to the body. Never mind trying to
find a res in the Great Unknown.

    Re-read. The target zone can be quite difficult. But the TRIP THERE
CAN'T BE! People won't risk life and limb for a CHANCE to get a group. But
if they can get to the zone and start LFGing without risk, they will go. The
better the loot, the more will go. You know that semi-zone line off Oasis?
Put Howling Stones off that zone line, and get rid of the zone-in mobs, and
the place would be PACKED with folks. You could do that for DN, too, and
same result - packed house. No matter the difficulty of the target zone,
people will adapt.

    And Fear. And Hate. And Sky. And many of the epic encounters. And the
Kunark dragons. And.... There's a boatload of raid-level stuff out there.
Your guild may have progressed past wanting most of it, but frankly at the
level your guild is at you can't really expect there to be much loot you'd
die to have, can you? What I see is "lesser" guilds spending a lot of time
on these areas I mention, "raiding". To them killing Velketor is useful,
killing Lord Bob is useful, going after Zlandicar is useful, and they aren't
single-group mobs.

>Only VP, ST and ToV would be considered strictly raid only zones.


    Come now! ST used to be a single-group zone! :P

    There may be few raid-only zones, but there is a TON of raid-only
content out there. And the same cannot be said of XP-group content for the
post-54 crowd.
