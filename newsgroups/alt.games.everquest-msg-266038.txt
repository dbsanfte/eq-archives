I'm trying to start off on a server with a lot of people around my time
zone, so if i ever do get a chance at raiding, i won't find it'll start at 1
am or whatever. Is anyone organising a server for people in our time zone?
Failing that, I'd like to go to the server that has the people from this
newsgroup, if there's a preference?

DVD ordered. Now to wait.....
