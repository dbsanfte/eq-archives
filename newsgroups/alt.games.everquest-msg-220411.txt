I didn't say anything about it being fun.  OTOH, it isn't painful
either.  Gives you something to do during melee as a lowbie besides
waiting for the mob to fall down.  I agree that given /loc it was
pretty stupid to have it be such a pita to use, and I won't even
mention the incredible cleverness of having SH fail at skill 200
when your compass and map both give your correct heading 100% of
the time ithout requiring an extra button push (well, okay, I
mentioned it).
