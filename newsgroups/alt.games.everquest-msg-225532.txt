When PoP first came out and I got access to PoV through the trials, I
think I got close to 2 levels of experience in 14 hrs in a back caves
group. Granted, we weren't mob limitted and there was almost 0 down time
waiting for replacements, but that is still close to doable now, with
the slightly better exp gain rate with the new grouping bonuses. I was
quite happy with PoP experience because at the time I was really not
into having to spend months levelling to the new max.
