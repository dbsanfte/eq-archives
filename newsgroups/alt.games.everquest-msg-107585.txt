Bullshit.  As another poster pointed out, a right-clickable no reagent
levitate item is hardly unimportant.  People used to sell looting
rights to the cloak for exorbitant amounts of pp (or trade for valuable
droppable items) _before_ the Mage epic existed.  The Mage's behavior,
if things happened as the OP says they did, was inexcusable.  Your
bizarre left-handed justification of that behavior is extemely
disappointing coming from someone who claims to be a guild leader.
