Normal charm dropping is not a problem. My usual setup is to have
wizard stun on break, chanter tash, resnare from druid, chanter
recharm, rewash. Furthermore, you can't resnare a charmed pet.. have
to refresh it on every break. Where good pet tanking goes bad is when
the pet tank breaks while it is tanking a mob. Now you have to pick up
the primary mob with a tank who has been sitting around doing
nothing(because you can only have 3 people on the primary mob's agro
list in order for it to hold agro.. usually chanter, one healer,
snarer) and if its a summoning mob your chanter is instadead.

As per the /shield on hotkey... if your tank is picking up the primary
mob its useless. /shield has an extremely small range without Gates AA
to extend it, for which the chanter has to stay in that range the
entire time it is up or it drops as soon as they leave. Trust me on
that if given a choice between backing away from a charm pet coming at
it or standing still and praying /shield saves them, the chanter runs
out of its range. Furthermore, a tank lasts about as long on a /shield
of a chanter with an amped charm pet as the chanter does. And
defensive and /shield do not mix. You can't /shield while defensive
and it drops as soon as you defensive. Unless of course you've gimped
the charm and not given it mage items, haste, ndt, etc.

Pet tanking.. when it worked decent enough and had skilled chanter it
was fine up to just past the Riddler. I certainly have heard of people
taking it all the way and WS'ing or furiousing the boss, but those
were far outnumbered by the horror stories i've seen and heard of. I
far prefer pet dps. As long as your recharm crew is on the ball you
just walk over mobs with a lot more control of the situation. You'll
need to med in each safe section that doesn't respawn a few minutes...
but that's no biggie.
