I just hit LV16 today (actually hit 15, then went to Highpass for orcs and
stayed till I hit 16...then had to go so I could get some sleep before work
after being up all night).
    Does anyone have any advice for usage of my new line of spells?  I
noticed we get 3 buff spells now?  And feign death?  I assume I don't need
to practice this one, as it is a spell, and if the spell goes off
successfully my chances of successful feigning are always the same (for that
mob anyway, I understand higher LV means less chance)?  Although it doesn't
look like we get many new attack spells (like LV12 did) at 16, what are some
good strategies?  What spells to have memmed and how to use them?
    Until now, here is what I had.
1 - Minor shielding (or which ever LV8 one was, didn't get one at 12).
2 - Convoke shadow (LV12 pet)
3 - Focus death (first pet buff - LV12)
4 - Siphon STR (get at lower LV, either 4 or 8 I think)
5 - Leach life (DoT lifetap spell - get at LV12)
6 - Lifetap (max 45 dmg? - get at LV12)
7 - Clinging darkness (almost always this one)
8 - Gate or invis or sometimes dark empathy...my generally free slot

I buff myself every time it starts to wear off, summon pet, buff pet when
needed, pull with leach life, send pet in to attack, siphon STR to weaken
mob (& give me more STR if it's worn off by now), sit and med until pet gets
low on HP or until need to clinging darkness a running type of mob (desert
madmen, animals), loot corpse and repeat.

What spells should I have memorized now at 16?  How should my fighting
strategy change now?  In groups I would target any engaged mob (one at a
time until all have been leach lifed), and if even or higher con would leach
life, and siphon STR for all to make them weaker & hit less hard in melee,
as well as often have pet attack higher LV cons, and sometimes I'd lifetap
them as well.

What strategies do most use now?  And where is a good place once Highpass
gets too slow in EXP (probably near 20-22?)?
