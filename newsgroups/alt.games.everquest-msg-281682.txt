My main was born in West Freeport, but I'll never call it or East
Freeport  home.  I'm tired of that rat bastard D'Lere and the corrupt
militia.

North Freeport is nice to visit but it's a pain to get to when your
WFP Militia faction is nuked :>

I've not visited Qeynos enough to judge.

I've worked my Heretics faction enough that the city of Paineel
considers me it's ally.  It's a nice place to visit, but I don't think
I'd want to live there, with all the high foreheads and book learnin'.

North Karana feels comfy, but it's damn well overrun with griffons and
lions and their ilk.  But I could see myself growing old in a little
hut by the river near the Scion spires.

However, I'd have to say that the Commonlands are by far the most
comfortable place for me.  I think I should like to live in an Inn in
the East Commonlands, keeping my head out of Sgt Slate's sights.  I
feel at home there.  I miss hunting among the rolling hills and the
tall trees.

Best regards,

Tim ==
