1) soloed a hill giant at 30. (the fact that it took 30 mins is irrelevant)

2) raced someone to a spot and won by an hour.

3) killed a tough aviak without taking any dammage, 3 years and 40 levels
ago (there is a disconnect in a tanks mind about medding time, it also
negatively effects a tanks best friend the cleric)

4) pulled a mob that a tank really wanted to pull before he got to it . And
when he tried to ks it he got laughed at.

5) laughed at the poor tank since he died 14 zones away through treacherous
terrain. Then commented that he had better get hoofing it and that no sorry
you only bought the personal version of sow that is self only and didnt you
call me an ass last week?

6) dragged 4 mobs over a resting tank, or one mob, since any number at all
is a huge annoyance.

7) after both you and the tank yelled for a group for an hour you told him
ah hell im going to go solo, and then you told him yeah I made 400 plats
soloing while you where fuming for the next coupla hours :p
