My Ogre Beastlord made the trip with no trouble. Actually there's a
gnome at the dock in North Ro who'll teleport you to Iceclad. Otherwise
you take the raft to a small island, cross it to the docks and wait for
the Icebreaker to arrive, it's got a wheel of mallets set in front of it
so it's hard to miss, get on board and enjoy the ride.

Cheers Watchman :)
