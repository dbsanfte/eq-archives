I don't think TheTribunal.org is very representative, it's mostly
populated by the relatively hardcore, it seems.

And I know that people do start grouping at lower levels - I spent
half my game time in LDoN from the high 20s (until then I was soloing
pretty much exclusively) to the 40s, and I do see people forming LDoN
groups in the low 20s, too.  Finding a non-LDoN group outside PoP is
usually pretty hard, though, and there are far more people playing >60
characters than below 60.

Yes, there are.  I believe there are a few guilds that will take
people at any level (at least I recall such guilds advertising in
PoK), but even most non-raiding guilds want you to be 30+, or at least
20+.  Unfortunately I don't recall many names.

My guild, Alliance of Steel, is pretty much non-raiding at this point,
and even though this is mostly because we don't have a raiding force
anyway, the intention isn't to turn into a hard-core raiding guild.
I'm not sure we'd accept a lowbie that none of us knows well, though.

Another guild that isn't a raiding guild, AFAIK, is Innoruuk's Dark
Maidens, but they only accept female dark elves, or used to anyway.
Anklebiters United (if they still exist...) only accept shorties, and
wood elf females.

Grey Wolves of Norrath is another "casual" guild, but I'm not sure how
well they're doing - GWoN is a cross-server guild and seems pretty
small on Tribunal.

Norrathian Guardians of Honor used to be a pretty big "family" style
guild, but I haven't seen them around much lately - may be that
they've fallen on hard times, or just not so many playing when I play.
They used to want you to be above level 20, too, IIRC.

However, I play on European times, so I miss most of the action since
Tribunal isn't one of those servers with a big Euro populationq.  I'm
sure there are plenty more "casual" guilds that I'm unaware of.

I'd suggest trying Firiona Vie, if you think you'd enjoy a bit of
roleplaying - there are plenty of guilds there accepting lowbies and
that don't expect you to play heavily.
