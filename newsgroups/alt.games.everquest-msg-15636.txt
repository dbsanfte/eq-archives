Were you a guide to have seen the petitions roll in, or is it just a matter
of seeing what guildmates and groupmates were petitioning about? One could
easily imagine the kinds of things people will petition over.

That's what the women who work the front desk at my office tell me. They
repeatedly inform people of the policies relating to what we do, and
repeatedly get trouble from people over it. They come to me to have me
repeat the same thing I said last week: "Tell them X." They tell the person
in question "X" with as polite a tone as they can must, and the person in
question complains to me about it.

I imagine the guides go through much the same thing.
