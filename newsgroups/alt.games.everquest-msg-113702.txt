Donation, though, has a fuzzy "who knows what it will be" flavor to
it that "pay" does not, and also suggests somehow that the arrangement
isn't quite so sleazy as payment; like paying for dinner and drinks
as opposed to paying for sex.

I personally prefer the more direct "pay" offers and the "fee" offers
from providers of EQ services, the former are indicative of the amount
of respect the buyer has for the service ("will pay 20pp for a 96% rez"
for example indicates someone who's looking for too much for too little)
and the latter lets me make sound economic descisions and establishes
that this isn't some vague personal favor, but a simple transaction.

I rarely pay for ports (I suppose thats a perk from rezing half of Morell
Thule no charge, or perhaps just from being a cleric) but the last time
I did, I hit a bobble.  You see, I asked the young druid "how much
would you like" and he said "whatever you think its worth" so I was
forced to shell out 100pp... when the going rate is clearly around
20pp!   To me, getting from WC to GD in time to help my friend
do the Broodmother quest was worth 100pp... would have been
a lot cheaper if the halfling had named his price though!

While less disengenous, I find "will pay" to be less likely to
garner my attention when I'm feeling greedy enough to Rez
for pay... Will Pay generally means a cheap little fee, Will
Donate much more likely to be substantial.  Best of all
is "will pay Xpp" where the amount is named up front... but
a dangling "will pay" with no amount specified is more likely
than not to be an offer so low as to be embarassing, 10pp
is far from the best return on investment for a high level cleric
blowing his travel time and 700 mana worth of med time, not
to mention (as doctors like to say when explaining their
exhorbitant fees) the time and effort it took to level up to
the point where that rez was available in the first place.

"Will Donate 100pp" is certainly the semantic muddle you
deride... although it serves the same purpose as "Will Pay
100pp" it tries to soften that down somehow but just looks
confused about the ideals behind the offer.  Perhaps they
will donate it to the Rivervale Orphans Fund in my name?
