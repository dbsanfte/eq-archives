And of course, they're busy sharing their hate for you with all their
socialising mob friends.  So you can get swamped if you're not careful.

Classic example is DL, where my monk was last night.  FD'ed a few bad
pulls.  Mobs can totally forget you if they get back to their spawn point,
but in DL, mobs wander around, so it doesn't always happen.  FD'ed some
spiders off, got back to pulling, and for the next 40 minutes, got aggroed
by spider after spider from long distance, because the original two had
been grassing me up ;)
