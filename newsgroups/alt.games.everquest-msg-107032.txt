    Side strafe - it speeds you up a lot with that snare on.

    They're tough if you don't have the resists. They summon, nuke like
wizards (and I mean smart wizards - lots of ice and fire, not as much Force
Shock nonsense), have a fairly hefty DD proc when they melee. They drop bits
and pieces like the shrooms do, and have a random rare drop WIS caster neck
with some nice mana-enhancing stats (something like 7 WIS and 50 MANA). We
avoid them usually, but with a hasted Chaktai quadding them they actually
never get off a spell and go down fast. "Chuck must be singing Elemental
Rhythms - he's hardly being touched by them flowery nukers!"

    All solid blue at 60, I've heard some summon but that might just be the
named. The geometry is what makes it neat - one to three of them spawn in a
cavern below the caller, and one to three of them spawn just outside the
tunnel where the caller is. So you have mobs rushing from both sides,
usually in close fast, and if you AoE stun you hit the Caller and he gets
cross.

    It's worth a shot. The top guilds on my server used to do this for XP
before we had to start camping bits and pieces for quests (ugh).

    I think it's because mushrooms come solo. All the fights you described
have adds. Try some of the non-shroom mobs - they usually come in pairs or
more. I find the bandits come in two, two, then four - you'd like them. :-)

    Give it a whirl, if you dislike it there's plenty of other places (The
Deep/Akheva/ME/Acrylia) to go up there.
