Over slaughter?  You bet your ass you do.    Theres just not enough time in
the half hour afterwards to kill every mob in the dungeon, when you only get
50 kills on the first clock.  Unless you're uber enough that you're winning
the slaughter in 30 minutes or less.

If you're not waiting for a slaughter, then I don't see how this applies to
you?

Not significantly.  Back to back adventures are extremely rare in my
experience.  I end up doing 2 adventures a night, whether they each take 2
hours or each take an hour and a half.

Ok, I officially hate you. : P

While it's a hundred times better than my warrior, my rogue has to wait for
invites now.  Sure there are 3 dps spots to fill usually, but it seems like
I'm competing with half the server.

Freaking paladins.

Again, if your groups aren't sitting there waiting for slaughters, then what
I'm complaining about doesn't apply.
