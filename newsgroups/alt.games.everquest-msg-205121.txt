Yes!  We were HAPPY to have rusty swords!  I saved for four levels to buy my
first Combine Longsword from the gypsies!  And I was HAPPY and PROUD to do
it!  And I had to walk uphill in knee-deep snow to get to the gypsies!  And
then I had to walk in waist-deep snow uphill to Freeport again!  UPHILL BOTH
WAYS!

Sorry, couldn't resist.
