As far as this story about "anyone"s kid goes, I won't be quite as
delicate as either of you. Complete fucking bullshit. The odds of
"accidentally" typing in a station name other than your own and having
it turn out to be a valid one are staggering beyond fucking belief. To
add onto that the odds of the user *THEN* (in ONE try, no less)
"accidentally" typing in an unknown password that is not only <valid>
but is the valid password that <matches> that one out of 425,000
accounts is............

Anyone, you should buy more insurance. Large meteors must strike your
house on a weekly basis. Of course, you could probably afford it, since
your son should be picking the correct pick six lotto numbers on EVERY
drawing with those kinds of odds and luck.
