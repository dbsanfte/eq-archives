Well then, glad I didn't get LDoN right off and play with my litle 
rogue...prob'ly woulda got uttin' and the dorf woulda been mad!  As it 
was, Miznit the Gnome wizard was around 27 when he did his first 
adventure, and that was after several months to "fix" the expansion.

I suppose I'll just learn to live with what I get, as I'm more interested 
in the grouping and xp than whether or not I (we) succeed...although I 
prefer to win the mission over failure or even partial points.  I have 
found that most of the people I have been grouped with feel the same way 
(some are more apt to want the loot/pp than anything else, however)..with 
a few whiners that are pissed if they don't have a 100% success rate.  
And the 2 or 3 that fit that last category (sp?) seem to be the ones that 
have no clue what it means when the cleric, wiz, necro, et al say "I'M 
OOM...DON'T PULL!!!!"  

(Last night's group somes to mind...healer said she was oom, and the tank 
was pissed that his pull with 3 adds killed him and two others, making it 
almost impossible to win the mission.  Then had the guts to say "Hey, 
thanks for the heal."  To which the healer responded "Hey, I told you I 
was OUT OF MANA!"  I groaned and chalked it up to knowing who NOT to 
group with.  Then the zone crashed and we lost anyway...oh well.)
