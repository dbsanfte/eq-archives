The problem with this construct is that at low health, you'll no longer 
be able to share the damage around; the mob will suddenly stick like 
glue to the first warrior to dip below his "low hp aggro" threshold. 
Once that warrior is dead, of course, you'll go back to being able to 
share damage between the remaining 5, but if they were all taking damage 
evenly, then very soon one of them will also get "low hp aggro", 
particularly since your ratio dropped from 6 times a solo warrior to 5 
times a solo warrior... soon to be 4 times, 3 times, 2 times, uh oh.

Now on the bright side, you'll actually do more damage than 6 times a 
solo warrior.  The warrior who is taking the damage at any given point 
gives up part of his damage due to stuns (unless he's an ogre).  This 
won't affect the other 5 warriors however.  And any warrior striking 
from the front will lose some of his DPS due to parry, block and 
dodge... and worst, Riposte.  A rough estimate is that warriors (anyone) 
striking from the rear arc will do 15% more damage than someone in the 
front arc of a mob.

Riposte also blows a small hole in your thesis; those warriors striking 
from the front arc will be taking riposte damage.  Assuming you form a 
circle around the mob, since you never know where it will face next, at 
any given time 3 of you will be in the "front" arc.  Thus instead of 15% 
more damage, you'll be doing half that, or 7.5% more damage... And 
you'll be taking 3 times the riposte DPS than a single warrior would 
take (admittedly, over a fight theoretically 1/6th as long, so only half 
the damage the solo warrior would take this way... but more than the 
1/6th built into your assumptions)

Again on the plus side, when low on HP any given warrior will go into 
crippling mode, slightly boosting his damage output.  I think this point 
  comes before "low HP aggro" point, so if the group is careful about 
spreading out damage, you could end up with all 6 in cripple mode fo a 
portion of the fight.  Indeed, if going after very easy mobs, you could 
deliberately bandage up between fights to just below the "no more 
crippling" threshold (40% hp?) and then do fights where everyone is 
crippling.

Or you could heal =one= warrior up higher, and have him function as main 
tank until he's back down to being crippled, before switching to 
backups.  With this plan you could have all 5 of the other warriors in 
the "rear" arc, thus boosting your damage output by about 5% (two 
warriors not in front arc, so not losing their 15%) and saving 2/3rds 
the riposte damage.

Another flaw: gear and level.  Unless you find 6 warrior clones (or more 
likely make them deliberately) you are going to see differences between 
them.  While this at first appears to mean little, on contemplation, I 
think you'll see that -some- warriors generate more aggro than other 
warriors.  These warriors, then, will interfere with the even spread of 
damage absorption which is key to your plan.  If they also have more AC 
and HP, then this will perhaps even out after all, but if its just that 
one who is lower level yet has a better hate generation (say a wood elf 
with a high dex and a fast high proc rate weapons) then it may get shot 
all to hell, see my "ten little indians" comment above)

At the root of your plan, though, is something more basic.  Yes, 6 
warriors are a better team than one warrior.  But 1 warrior and 5 
-other- classes will in almost every instance be a -better- team.  Most 
classes do more DPS than warriors, -or- are much better healers than 
warriors, -or- have slow and haste.

With slow and haste available, a single warrior can probably outkill 
your 6 warriors. With slow, haste, heals, and a shaman pet, a warrior 
with a shaman friend can almost certainly outkill your 6 warriors.  If 
you wanted to go pure melee, three warriors sharing out the damage with 
3 rogues taking the back end will outkill your 6 warriors, as the mobs 
will die much faster, meaning that each of your 3 warriors will be 
damaged only as much as each of your 6 warriors were before, yet you 
still have 6 people to do the bandaging.

Pull One warrior out to swap in a shaman, or even a druid or cleric, and 
your kill rate would go thru the roof.  Put in a mage and it would go up 
appreciably due to DS plus the mage being better damage output than the 
warrior he replaced.  Put in a necromancer or shadowknight and you'd be 
able to kill things without the down time due to healing; fear kite! 
The list goes on and on, removing one warrior and swapping in any other 
class would make this group better, to one degree or another.

But if removing -one- warrior helps a little, removing more warriors 
helps more.  Replacing warriors willy nilly will get you healing, DPS, 
slow/haste, crowd control, single pulls... reduce down to just one 
warrior and you're in a much better condition.  And often, eliminating 
even that last, depending on group composition and what your replacement 
is, would make the group better still.

Sad but true.  Perhaps the upcoming Openings thing plus the other 
warrior changes will improve that situation.
