He hasn't spawned since beta, except for GM events.  And he wasn't
unbalanced, so much...his home and its pathing along with the aggro-
through-walls-and-irrespective-of-the-Z-axis meant that the level
22 folks hunting at the pond could conceivably aggro him and drag
him to the zone-in to corpse camp everybody for a month...

Imagine zoning into Blackburrow and having Klandicar guarding the
tree or something..
