I am sort of biased here, but you may want to consider rerolling as
a DEF necro.  Night vision + Hide racial abilities more than make up
for the lower int (plus Neriak is just a cool city).  Iksars are great
necros too if you can stand the 20% xp penalty.  As for food and water,
there are many neutral vendors throughout Norrath, plus you can bank in
Ogguk, Neriak, and the OT outpost (to name a few).

Don't get discouraged!  I find alot of my friends trying necros and
deleting them after only about 9 lvls.  It can be VERY rewarding...
in later levels.  Plus, with the pet changes you don't have to worry
about outdamaging your pet, which makes for very mana efficient soloing.

Good Luck!
