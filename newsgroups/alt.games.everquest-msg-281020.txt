Actually, death after hell levels *was* bigger in the old days.  The XP 
loss on death at level N was a fixed percentage of the amount of XP that 
level N-1 required to complete.

So, if the level XP requirements had been, say:

   N-2      80 million XP
   N-1     180 million XP (hell level)
   N       100 million XP
   N+1     110 million XP

(rough numbers for illustration...I did not bother to actually fit them 
to the cubic XP curve that Everquest used back then).

then XP loss on death would be (using 12%, which is what I vaguely 
remember the number being):

   N-1       9.6 million (5.3% of the XP bar)
   N        21.6 million (21.6% of the XP bar)
   N+1      12 million (10.9% of the level)
