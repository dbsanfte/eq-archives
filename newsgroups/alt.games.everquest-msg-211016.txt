The PoK quest IH2 item really isn't worth your time.  The mobs that drop
some of the quest pieces are not frequently hunted, and the named mobs seem
pretty rare.  I have spent about 5 hours camping the stonegraber drop and
have not yet seen the named.  I gave up and got my cleric a Book of Obulus,
even though I would rather he have a shield for pure aesthetic reasons.  As
a side note, two friends of mine(husband and wife) made a Shaman/Mage combo
and duoed their way into the 60s.  At higher levels the use of slow becomes
much more important than the damage from your pet's damage shield.
