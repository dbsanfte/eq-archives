}If there are no mobs nearby, another way you can check to see if hide

}Wiley, you do
}/target wiley
}If it says, "I don't see anyone around here with that name.", hide was
}successful.  Otherwise, if it targets you, it was not successful.

Don't forget, though, that this technique will always seem to fail if you 
have See Invis / SoE / Leviathan Eyes / Acumen / Deadeye / Vision Shift / 
Plainsight / Spirit Sight up, or an item with similar effects...
