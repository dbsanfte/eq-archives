Disclaimer: I've never played a rogue (well I have a level 5 rogue
but that hardly counts)

Rogues are the best damage dealers in the game, bar none.  Only monks
approach their damage output, and even they're significantly behind.
Wizards come nowhere near.

They can move through the majority of the world with impunity with hide
& sneak (although this isn't as effective in some very high level
dungeons), making them superb scouts and corpse retrievers, and decent
pullers.

They can pick locks and disarm traps in several dungeons, allowing
access to otherwise difficult or impossible areas.  Howling Stones &
Sebilis Crypt are two prime examples of high level areas where rogues
are in demand.  Trap disarming is most useful in Velious - Tower of
Frozen Shadow, Velketor's Labyrinth & Dragon Necropolis, for example.

I'd say that makes them fun to play.  It's all personal preference
though.
