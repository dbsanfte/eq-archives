I agree.

However, there are entirely too many lazy beastlords out there who sic
the pet and never look at it again.  I do have to reposition dogdog
from time to time on a long fight or when the MT decides to 'spin' the
mob and my pet ends up alongside the MT.  Heh, then holler at me about
push...  gee, yer both pushing it the same bloody way!

So yeah, I don't think my pet pushes any harder than any other player
or pet.  When soloing, if I'm on one side and dogdog is on the
backside, that mob just plain won't move.  BUT... in a group
situation, the pets sure can look bad - I think mainly because while a
player character is repositioning or out of melee range, a pet *never*
gets out of range - its on a mob like glue.  Perhaps that little extra
bit is all it takes.

But I still think most of it is lazy beasties - if I see all the melee
next to my dog, I know its time to move the dog.
