I'll grant you that, you don't do nearly as much viciously disparaging as 
some of the other conservatives around these parts.

}Ahh, back to the "ditto-head" argument.  Yes, yes, I take my marching orders
}from Rush, I have no mind of my own.

}Maybe you should define your position, instead of letting Farrakhan and
}Jackson speak for you.  Would I be wrong to associate them with liberals?
}Would I be wrong to associate Clinton and Gore with liberals?  How about
}Gephard and Daschal?  Do you claim Dan Rather or Peter Jennings?  If these
}guys aren't your speakers, then who is????  I've listened to all of these
}self-proclaimed liberal spokesmen, and I see little to respect.  If you're
}going to keep denying these spokesmen, then point me to a liberal you wish
}to speak for you, or speak for yourself, otherwise I must assume you're
}playing a shell game with your representatives and your beliefs.

We could make the same argument... Who the heck is your spokesman?  
Associating that list of names with liberals is like associating, say, for 
example, David Duke, Pat Robertson, Clarence Thomas, Trent Lott, John 
Ashcroft, Jerry Falwell, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rush Limbaugh, etc, with 
your precious conservative movement.  Oh, and we can't forget the Bushes, 
the Reagans, Cheney, etc.  Do all of these people speak for you?

}> You'll not tar me with a brush aimed at politicians, because I won't
}> defend the hypocritical bigots you want to use to define "the left".
}I don't use them, Rush doesn't use them, Liddy doesn't use them, and Hamblin
}doesn't use them.  Those who give them voice, either by supporting them
}financially, or by electing them use them to define the left.  Or, if your
}prefer, acknowledge that I am completely correct about the segment of the
}population that I am referring to, and then draw a line and show how they
}are not true liberals.  Conservatives have had to do that for the past
}twenty years, as the leftist politicians have tried to hang every epiteth on
}our heads from fascist to racist.

So turnabout is fair play, eh?

}> If you say "greed is good" you are unChristian.  Period.  I don't

Ayn Rand.  Not, note, that I agree with her, but there -is- support for 
such a statement.

}> person ever in history who has had the luxury to succeed or fail

}> to do with this concept, in fact the freer the market the less
}> chance your personal efforts will have anything to do with success

}While that makes a nice little blurb against global capitalism, it isn't
}exactly correct.  New companies spring up and rise to success all the time.
}New franchises are created, niche markets are filled.  Old companies that
}cannot adjust are bought out by those who can.  When the needs of the market
}are not being met, new competitors rise up to claim their place.

Yes, these things happen.  But they almost never happen unless there's 
enough capital in someone's hands to make an initial investment.

}Even so, your decription is the foundation of monopolies and corruption,
}which are the destruction of a free-market system.  They inhibit competition
}which is the life blood of capitalism.

Aye, but they also are too easily the end result.  Capitalism gone too 
far, perhaps.  Or is antitrust law somehow not a restriction on free 
trade?
