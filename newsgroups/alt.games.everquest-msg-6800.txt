For me....that's my current character.  What makes them good?

well, Clerics have to worry about 2 things: Healing and mana.  The more
wisdom you have = the more mana you have.  Sure, I'm a total weakling, but
having that extra mana is worth not being able to wear the heaviest of
armors.  I'll most likely die whether I'm wearing fine plate or leather,
it's just a matter of WHEN.

Plus, I don't have to work AS hard to get +wis items, I can concentrate a
little more on +str items.

So for ME, the best right now is the High Elf Cleric.
