 I recently had some problems, but it was when I got overzealous and
installed directx8. But...for what it's worth here's something to try. After
installing directx, make sure that you re-install the latest video drivers
for your card (the key is..._after_ you install directx). If you get any
messages about older files being copied, choose the option that replaces
files with the older copy (i.e. don't keep the newest versions). This worked
for me.
