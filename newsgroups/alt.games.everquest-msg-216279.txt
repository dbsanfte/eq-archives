I have a system that is similar, particularly the Geforce video card.  What
I do is alt-tab out of EQ, go to video properties, advance Geforce settings.
I use Reset Defaults and then set the Performance options to High.  This is
eliminates all lag and it is something that I have to do every time I start
EQ.  This started with the LDoN upgrade and I believe it is related to the
DirectX settings in EQ.  Once in awhile I have to do this process twice, but
I don't have the lag problem anymore.

Good Luck
