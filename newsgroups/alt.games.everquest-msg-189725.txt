McDonald's hasn't cooked 'em in lard in quite a while.  What they do now 
instead is inject 'em with beef flavoring/essence/whatever and call it 
"natural flavoring."  The part that annoys me is that they claimed it 
wasn't beef and that several religious factions who would have otherwise 
not eaten the fries believed McDonalds.  Somewhat recently they finally 
confessed that it is actually beef-based.

Give me burger king fries over mcdonald's any day.  Ah, In-n-Out.  One of 
many things I miss about California now living in Michigan.  Still like 
burger king's fries better though :P

What frightens me is when people actually prefer 'em over other places' 
fries in the first place.  The last time I ate 'em (admittedly, years 
ago), they were limp and soggy and nasty anyway.

PS: I've been a vegetarian for a little over a year now (with the 
occasional moment of weakness with respect to free sushi dinners), but 
even before then I couldn't stand McD's fries.
