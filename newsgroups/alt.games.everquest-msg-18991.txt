Two things you'll probably need:  Some form of crowd control (wether
it be 'chanter, bardsong, or plain ol' Root), and an exceptionally
good puller.  Monk/Sk preferable for fiegn death.  Even on the first
floor, you can pull some nasty, nasty trains out of this place.

If you hunt the first floor, then you'll probably want some form of
levitation.  The main chamber is slippery, and will drop you into the
pit at the bottom, it's very difficult for a puller to make it to the
group while getting pounded on without it.  If you're hunting the
second floor, be prepared to deal with caster mobs and damage shields.
Stuns and nulify magic are a must for survival here.

Do not think that the opening hallway is a safe area to pull to.
Sure, you can run to the mirror if you get into trouble, but chances
are wandering Shadow Guardians waiting outside can wipe out your party
just as assuredly as trains can inside.

Other than that, it's a great zone to hunt in. The drops on the first
three floors aren't specacular (although there is a great melee helm
dropped on the second floor), but it's good, steady exp.
