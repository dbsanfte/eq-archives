But completely irrelevant.  You are voluntarily paying Verant to play EQ,
you can stop paying, and stop playing anytime that you feel that the service
is not worth what you are paying.  The IRS on the other hand takes a dim
view to you deciding that you aren't getting enough for your taxes, and
therefor no longer paying them, which can result in some rather bad
consequences.
