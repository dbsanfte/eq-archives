I'd personally go with XP. I use 2000 myself because I'm comfortable with it
and am to lazy to download all the new patches and stuff I already have
saved on my computer

if your gonna go all out (looks like you have money with your system being
built) go 1g and 2000/XP

Personally I'd go Geforce4. It's the 'standard' nowadays and can't really go
wrong with it. the speed difference (think ati is ahead or close to G4)
isn't really gonna be that noticable imo

Sound Blaster Audialogy Gamer is probably what your gonna want. Either that
or Audialigy Platinum.
