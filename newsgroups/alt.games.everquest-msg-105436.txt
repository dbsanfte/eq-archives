As a parent, I cannot imagine a more terrible personal tragedy than losing a child.  Of course, I have the greatest of sympathy for this
woman and what she must be going through.



On the subject of this lawsuit, however, I must agree with many of the other comments here.  This is another example of the "training" we
have all had in our society over the past 20+ years.  At the tutelage of the legal profession (with support from the insurance companies),
we are being taught that we are all "victims," and that:

1. Whenever we have an accident (like spilling hot coffee in our lap), it's somebody else's fault because they didn't specifically tell us
that hot stuff can burn us.

2. Whenever some idiot uses a plane, or a car, or anything else to hurt people, it's the fault of the  plane manufacturer, or the car
manufacturer, or the manufacturer of whatever device was used, because they didn't specifically tell us that someone could hurt us with
these items.

3. If some guy driving home tired from work isn't paying as close attention as he should and cuts me off, he is intentionally and
specifically  targetting me personally to be mean to.

4. If anything bad happens to anyone at any time for any (or no) reason, somebody is a victim of somebody else's gross negligence, and
therefore is deserving of multi-million (or billion) dollar "awards".


Ha ha.  And all this from somebody who thinks the owners of tobacco companies should be cellmates with crack dealers.  (Still, in my
opinion, smokers haven't been "victims" of tobacco companies since the first Surgeon General's report linking smoking to cancer, and the
smokers should have to pay their own medical bills for smoking-related illness)
