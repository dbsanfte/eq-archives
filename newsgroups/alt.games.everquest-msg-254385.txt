All these changes convinced me to reup my subscription for another month to see
what is new...  I logged in for the first time in about 4 months last night... 

First thing I noticed was that my hands had already forgotten how to move in
EQ.  LOL  CoH is mapped differently than EQ so I kept slamming into walls and
backing up when I meant to go forward...  I think people thought I must have
been drunk.  =P

Second thing I noticed was that my buffs all have little timers on them!  Yay! 
I had read about that patch and that was something I looked very forward too.

I use the Defaul UI for my druid and a different UI for my Cleric.  While I was
on my druid I didn't notice the mana thing.  On my cleric, I opened my
inventory at one point to check something and lo and behold, there is my mana! 
At the time I was 213/2973  LOL  Had just finished a rez and a temp and all
sorts of stuff.  The party did a Mana check and I said: "213/2973".  There was
silence.........  Then someone said, "Wow... um... what is that percentage
wise?"  LMBO  

So I went back to saying 14% or whatever and everyone was happy.  I was the
only person in the group however that could see my mana that way.

Maybe the patch today will fix it.  Can you tell me though, What about
Endurance?  Because I also have numerical Endurance on that same UI.  Kind of
shocked me....

It's an old UI I've had forever and never updated...  I just log in hoping that
it still works and if not I'm prepared to switch back to default.

Sorry for the long reply.
