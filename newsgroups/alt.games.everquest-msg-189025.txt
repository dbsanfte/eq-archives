I think that with the resist modifier chopped from CoD, Enchanters are where
they need to be in terms of power. Hardest (or second hardest, if you count
Bards) class to play, thus logically they should have a fair amount of
ass-kicking power. Currently at 51, and am able to die less often
than -anyone- else in my guild, because I've figured out all the tricks of
the class.
