Herbalist pack is not NO DROP, only LORE ! Go get it, you have the required
level, even to solo there.

Evil eye bag is sold 400 - 500pp at EC tunnel

Lion Skin Backpack on a trol rare spawn in SK (killed once cannot remember
name and reduction butTroll conned blue at 23 i think, and reduction sucks)

Crafted backpacks are capacity 10, 10% weight reduction, Giant size.
Trivial at 82 in Tailorism and require a backpack pattern and a HQ bear
pelt.
can be baught for 80 - 100pp at EC tunnel
You can easily do Large pouch, cap 6 size giant 10% W-reduc with a LQ bear
pelt and a silk cord.

There is a purse with 75% weight reduction on coins. This one rocks !
When mobs drops 1pp 60gp 40sp 80cp like HG, u r very happy whit it :)

I lost too much stuff with mage summoned bags hehe, they are great but
dangerous.
Put a postit on your screen when usig summoned bags.
