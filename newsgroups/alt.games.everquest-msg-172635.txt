True, but from your posts it sounds like you're unhappy with the habits
common to human intelligence.

There's nothing modern about diminutives or nicknames.  Humans have used
them as long as they've had language.

Because characters in fantasy worlds are never superficial?  How
unimaginative.

Then how has it been altered or bastardized if it's always been that way?

Most often familiarity or contempt, as I have previously stated.

But they make a decision to use "wizzie" instead of "wizard".  Are you
saying they do so automatically, without thought?

Because you're a human, and humans are socialized organisms.  If you don't
care what others think of you, why post here?

But before that you said:

You were saying wanting to seem cool was solely the domain of people who's
identity is based on posing and clowning.

The world has barely changed; the game has evolved.  The behaviors and
language of the PCs is what has evolved.  You're imagining that the game is
limited to the content served by Sony.  It includes the actions of everyone
who plays it.  Otherwise you'd be playing a single person game.

Then you're chosing to keep a desire that can never be fulfilled, and
stating that desired condition as fact.
