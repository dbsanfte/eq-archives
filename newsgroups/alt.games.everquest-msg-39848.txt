The best necros I have grouped with temp to be real careful with
taunt/aggro, snare realiably, use screaming terror to help a chanter
mez, feed the cleric/sha/chanter mana, and backup heal. Oh... And deal
damage like the badass you are.

In a powerful group, do not underestimate your own power. I had a 59
necro healing me (and keeeping up mind your) in "The Pit" in Velketors
Lab the other day.

I play a 58 Warrior.

Mind you the cleric was AFK, but I made my point, necros are eaily the
most underestimated grouping class. And the least understood. IMHO 2
necros are twice the crowd control of an enchanter (at high levels
anyway), add a bard in for mana and you have a ferocious start to a
group.
