I still count to 8.  Been doing it so long now that it is just part
of my Bard play style.  I do like the cast time thing, and am trying
to get used to using it.

I would like to be able to move it to a better location on my screen
though.  Being upper left it is a bit out of line of site for me
when fighting.  That is what I get for playing in the old screen
style though I guess.
