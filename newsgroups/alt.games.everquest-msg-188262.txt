In some game, don't remember which, a magic user had an enchant item spell
which would create a magic effect on a mundane item.  Using the spell again
would add charges to the item, up to the limit for that item.  This would
seem to be the "proper" solution in game.  Of course, it hasn't been
implemented, but within EQ, you would have to find a magic user with both
sufficient level and type for the spell on the item, who had the particular
capability.  I wouldn't hold my breath.

Cheers,
Eric
