Ditch this unless you want to work up 1HB, if so stick it in off hand
when you're not 100% focused on max damage output.

>Elder Owlbear Beak:  Piercing, 7/23,  +3 STR, +2 DEX, +2 STA, +2 AGI

Bin this.

>Fungusbeast Spine:  Piercing, 13/23, Disease Damage +2

Put this in primary as this is BY FAR the best weapon you have.  It'll
get better once pass 20.

>Centi Short Sword:  1HS, 12/25,  +5 STR, +5 STA

Off hand this.

At level 17 you'll soon have Pierce up to scratch.  Don't worry about
dual wield, it'll raise itself perfectly well during normal combat.
