As I understand it (and fanart falls into several grey areas), while the
copyrighted materials remain property of the orignal rightsholder, the work
itself is property of the artist.  So, while I may not have the right to
sell a picture I draw of the cast of Haibane Renmei, neither could
Yoshitoshi ABe use my drawing without my permission.
