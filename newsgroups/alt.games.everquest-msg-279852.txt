Well, as I understand it (and haven't been yelled at for working it
this way), the MA is the secondary tank and/or the person designated
to tank a second mob that is either unmezzable or no other way to
control it. I may have jobs mixed up, but the way it works (for me,
at least) is that you set up a second hotkey with the MA's name so
there's no fumbling around or extra time taken up by having to manually
type /assist <x>. Which is good if their name is something like
Aeidksoeisns. :P
