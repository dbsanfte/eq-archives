That's not what we're arguing.  I'm objecting to the idea that the guards
are somehow an "immature" way to escape mobs, simply by the fact that they
aren't present in higher level zones (where they wouldn't make sense).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
