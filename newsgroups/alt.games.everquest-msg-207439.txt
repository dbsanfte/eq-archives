Ok let's say its only 1%. That's 4000 people.
With web boards, newsgroups, and quest web pages like Allakhazams
and people sharing info I find it highly unlikely that any quests are
unsolved.

All the quests that 'can' be solved have been.

There may indeed be unsolved quests, but that doesn't mean that they
are solvable by any reasonable means. Either the quest text is too cryptic,
misspelled or just plain not logical.

If there are quests in the game that go unsolved for more than 6 months
then Sony better take a hard look at those quests.
