I will say that I was in FP the other night and someone shouted for a
master smith. When I replied, he asked me if I could make him a
skinning knife. I told him that I wouldn't mind at all, except that
the nearest place I knew of to get the molds for that were in Kaladim.
I had too much going on at the time to make the trip. He begged me to
sell mine and offered more and more until I finally gave in at 75pp.
He had no trouble paying it and walked away happy to finally have one.
I walked away with the amount of money it took for me to plan on
making the trip back to Kaladim for more molds (of which I bought
several :). Everyone walked away happy.

I have sold them in the past for 5 to 10pp on the occasions when I had
extras.
