}Thing is... more than a macro program.. which is designed to just use

}complete seperate windows.

Yea, I just don't think that's necessary.  There are enough hooks just by 
having xylobot look at the eqlog files, and possibly output from ShowEQ, 
for mob /locs.  Why write a whole new thingy if you don't gotta?
