That is my understanding as well. On reviewing the log, it was
definitely a slash for 36 points, in fact it is the only hit above 17 in
the log, so I must presume there had to be some sort of bizarre "hiccup"
in the system. I have many hits of 16 or 17, but only the one higher.
Must be the exception that proves the rule!
