I will never think it's a good idea to let players be mobs on a
general basis, but I kinda like this. The low levels and lack of
communication, zoning, looting while this should remove most exploit
options.  It's sure as hell more  interesting than gems :)


>- Trivial Loot code has been removed from the Stonebrunt Mountains and the Warrens.

/cheer
It might be a win for pharmers, but it's also a win for roleplayers
("Ok, so I am such a badass I broke the magically enhanced bracer of
uberness this little mob was wearing, but his rusty sword survived the
fight just fine" ...riiiight.)
Now, if only they'd lose it on Firiona Vie so my half elf can travel
more freely without worrying about getting this and that drop before
she's too old for it... 

>- Fixed a bug that allowed corpses to get stuck inside walls while creating a phantom

<Montgomery Burns>Excellent!</MB>

Bughunters have really exerted themselves this time, eh? :)

>- We have changed the way the /consider command works and expanded the level range at
>which players are able to gain experience.  We have added a 'light blue' area between
>green and blue.  NPCs that used to /consider green but gave experience will now
>/consider light blue, as well as NPCs of slightly lower level than those greens.  You

It was fun to login on my tropical island and see, instead of half a
dozen blue Spirocs and a ton of green, half a dozen blue and a ton of
light blue :) Killing high green aggros will be much less annoying now
(I prefer using my mana getting exp instead of wasting 5 minutes
meditation time for nothing)

>- Added /targetgroupbuff.  Type /targetgroupbuff on to activate, off to turn it off.

Nice!

>inventory due to a cancelled trade or looting items (and other cases).  This will

Very nice!!

>- Added code that prevents player characters from dropping coins on the ground.  This
>should prevent the loss of coins due to accident or scam.

I don't really see the point.

>- You now see the number of hit points you are healed, and you also now see how many
>hit points you heal when healing others.

Ditto - the only thing this resulted in was promoting clerical envy
when heal hps were tested by non-clerics who didn't know about the 10%
bonus, and discussions about why the message said "heals for x points
of _damage_".
Also, I didn't see the message when I healed others, only when I was
healed.

First part good, second part VERY bad. Anyone with above-racial forage
skill is going to have more food than they could ever need and are
certain to forage stuff even on CRs before they get too hungry. So,
now I am going to take my 200 foraging skill and have to spend even
more time looking for aviak eggs, morning dew and oak bark :(
I can't see 'abundant special forages' being a problem for anyone but
the skill 50+specials that Iksar get, so I hope and pray that the last
part of the message means I'll be less nerfed than them... 

I'm rereading this a couple times and can't get 'more items in zones
that already have special items' to really match with 'more food will
be foraged'. Is it nerfed by adding more special items where several
special forages are food, or is it nerfed by point blank lowering the
special forage rate?

Oh, and I got a fish scale at the GD dragon ring last night.
