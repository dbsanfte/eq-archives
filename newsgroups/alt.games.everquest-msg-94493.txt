For the past two nights, I was camping my Paladin and my
twink Bard near the AoF room.  Just by chance, I camped
out by the zone line last night before the patch.

Phew...

On the downside, though, what I was doing there besides
PL'ing the bard was stocking up on Lizard Blood Potions,
which (since they were instant-cast) made great "escape
from an ugly situation" gate potions, especially while
soloing.

Now, however, I'd be *INSANE* to actually use one (it
gates you into the maze in CT, which would now be
a deathtrap).

So much for quick escapes for my Paladin.  Sigh.
