Correction: You have *dozens* of books, tablets and even probably e-mails by 
now, *allegedly* written or dictated by some creator or another. With that 
in mind, the possibilities are that

a) none

b) one

c) many

d) all

are actually "real" in the sense of having actully been written or dictated 
by a god or gods. Logic seems to indicate that a) is correct, whereas my 
Fortean nature would get a kick out of d) being correct. Christians of 
course tend towards b), but this is a matter of faith, not logic.

As for being unable to 'explain' God not precluding being able to discuss 
God, it's true, in the same sense that not having the faintest idea of what 
I'm talking about does not preclude me from discussing the latest 
developments in String Theory, if I feel so inclined.
