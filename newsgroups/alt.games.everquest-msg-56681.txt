Wolf form will keep the brownies off your case; but the bitch horse doesn't like
anybody in any form. She still attacks in wolfie. =(  I hate that horse too; but
at 52 I can kill her (as long as I'm FoM and resist buffed when I start.) Hint:
her pathing is buggy as hell. There are places where she'll just stand still and
let you nuke her to death, although you may have to let her chase you about a
while till she hits one. And snares and roots won't hold on her; don't waste the
mana on them, just nuke.
