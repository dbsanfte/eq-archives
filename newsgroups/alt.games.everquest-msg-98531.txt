Actually, if you let a crucial skill lag a bit, your master gives
you consignments that are too low to boost your skill.  I was a 
400 something armor crafter getting green consigments.  No worries
about leveling past the point where materials are still easy, 
constant cash stream.  With a Firbolg bard as your crafter, and
extensive knowledge of the NPC's in Tir Na Nog, I was able to 
generate a sustained income (at level 9) that was nothing short
of amazing, if you translated it into EQ buying power.
