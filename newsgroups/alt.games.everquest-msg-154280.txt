FCFS.  What would it have mattered if 6 wizards showed up, or 10 of their
guild showed up (sufficient numbers for rage and VS)

Don't confuse MB and blatent KSing, and dont whine about FCFS if your server
doesn't use a calendar

The mobs they were killing were neither
a) high end
b) needed a lot of friends and allies to kill

VS is a single group or less raid for a high end guild..  remember that next
time you write a cry baby letter to VI. Maybe uber guilds should be banned
too?
