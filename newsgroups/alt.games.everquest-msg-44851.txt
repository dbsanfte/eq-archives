Surprisingly enough it was a gift.  You'd be surprised.  I try my best to RP
when possible, help people out and be a good guy to strangers.  Higher lvl
sks have given me things from a mith 2hander to believe it or not a piece or
two of sentient.   Now I'm not too big on twinking but if it's given to me,
I mean what am I supposed to do with it?   Aye I had some really good stuff
=(  

Thanks for all the pointers guys.
