It seems to me that you're ignoring the fact that he paid to use their
forum. If I paid to go to your house, and was expelled for violating the
rules, I'd have at least the right to dispute your interpretation of the
rules and of my behavior.

On a more general note, I'm quite surprised by the fact that so many people
are quite ready to defend the rights that come from ownership, while so few
seem to care about the rights of customers, users, and so forth... (I'm
referring, for instance, to the long, sad story of the Steam/Valve debate).
It must be an American fashion... :-)

Well, not just a joke, maybe, if I remember correctly some of Mr. Bush
electoral slogans... Sometimes people seem to identify themselves with what
they hope to become, rather than what they actually are.

But let me stop here. I'm already more than OT.
