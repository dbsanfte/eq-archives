Unless I miss my mark, the only inputs to this program are /loc, and the
map.  /loc is a feature of the game, and the maps are readily available, so
it fails the "not normally available" requirement.

All it's doing is automating what a player could already do.  Print out a
map, take marker of some sort, and place it wherever his /loc says he is.
The only thing can see that may be slightly questionable is reading the maps
from the file.  Still, it's not as if those aren't already available.  Now,
if it added spawn points, and mob locations (like showeq), then I'd say it
was a clear hack.

We appriciate (and most of us share, I think) your distaste for hacks and
the like.  I just don't think this qualifies.  All it does is automate
something we already do.
