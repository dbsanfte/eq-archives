Keep agro on yourself and let the rog  get the opportunity to BS (tho if
he's been tanking alot its no doubt a pile of shite, good time to practice
:) ). Tash, slow (if necessary) , etc, give yourself the DS and spirit. so
long as he evades succesfully enough it'll work nice.

If you use the anime then mez/blur method you wanna be doin tougher mobs
than droga, get some nice reds to him to finish off.

11/22 isnt all that bad. Shaded dagger ?:)
