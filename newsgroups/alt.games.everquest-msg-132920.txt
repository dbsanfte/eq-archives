There is an odd thing that happens...try this:
Go invis or hidden behind a KOS mob *before* you target it. Then
target it, still hidden/invis, and it will turn to look at you. It
wont aggro but it will turn. This might work as a way to pull I have
never tried it.


Remember - It's just a GAME damn it!
