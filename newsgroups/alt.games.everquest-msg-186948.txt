Hi,

I just wanted to share some fun with you I recently discovered.
I was looking for a group with my main character (lvl 27 Necromancer) and 
I found a friend who was going to Paws to find a group there herself.

I decided to go with her, and she picked me up in the Nexus, since its 
been two years since I went to Paws, and she's a druid, and would be able 
to shorten my journey bo SoWing me :-)

Once there we quickly found another group looking for members, consisting 
out of a lvl 30 Monk, lvl 25 Cleric and lvl 25 ranger. Quite a nice group 
for going inside Paws and do some hunting.

Once inside however things started to go a bit wrong and our main tank 
(the monk) got quite some hits *quickly* and dropped dead about two times 
before I decided to take another tactic. I still had C3 on me, so I 
decided to let the druid/ranger snare the mobs, and I'd nuke the heck out 
of them, and they'd all go aggro on me. I was running like hell ofcourse, 
but the rest of the group, including my boney, was pounding merrily away 
at the groups back while I was running circles like mad, occasionally 
lifetapping to regain some hits I received, but all in all it worked out 
quite well, until the monk an I got charmed.

Luckily I'm running EQwindow, and killed EQ as quickly as I could ;)


We tried a few other times at the double doors in Paw, but I'm sure as 
hell not pulling, and the monk had some pretty nasty pulls resulting in 
almost insta-death for him, and a zone run for the rest of our group.

After rezzing him with our cleric for 25% xp we decided to go to Rathe 
mountains to hunt Cyclopses and other nasty stuff there.

After running through the Aviak Village, and going in a wide bow around 
an undead Cyclops wich made me almost come in my pants (I AM a necro you 
know...) we zoned into Lake rathetear, and had some intresting little 
squabbles with the gnolls who aggro'ed on our poor Cleric. We went for a 
swim, though I took the boat (kajak?) and went for Rathe Mountains.

Finally there we had a blast killing Cyclopses and Giant Skeletons. Even 
killed a named Cyclops a few times. Too bad we ended with an overpull 
with a Cyclops, his named brother, and two Giant Skeletons, but luckily 
we had our Cleric who could rez us, and all in all it was a fun thing to 
discover this aggro-kiting. It really saved our cleric some precious mana 
healing our main tank. I'd try fear kiting, but in Paws you never know 
which way your target is going to run to, and fear got resisted, and 
lasted too short sometimes as well to be effective.
