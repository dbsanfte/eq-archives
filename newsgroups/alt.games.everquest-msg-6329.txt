  Okay, my Monk is about to hit 16.  My plat supply isn't particlarly
high, but I'd like to afford better gear than what I have now (a
combination of Cured Silk, Netted and Raw Silk).  At my level, and able to
spend maybe 30-50 plat per piece (Wisp Isle, here I come), what kind of
gear should I be looking for?

	Ultimately, it works the way it does because it's the way plastic
exterior transtemporal mechanics function when you're dealing with
omni-dimensional ripple effects triggered at the end of a continuum
packet.		- Kurt Busiek
