That depends on what you want to do with dual monitors.  If you run EQ2 in a 
window, you can have that Window on one monitor, and browse forums, maps, 
other websites, etc online from the other monitor.  But you can not have 
both monitors running EQ2 with, say, your gameplay view on one monitor, and 
your inventory, stats, etc on another.

EQ2, itself, may  be able to stretch across two monitors (again, in windowed 
mode) but that would leave your character split down the middle between both 
monitors.
