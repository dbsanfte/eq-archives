Ok so we eliminate reality and yes my argument fails....sheesh.

Wow dont see how you coulda missed these things, seen prob 1 in 5
fifty+ warriors wieling these. Mine, 54 war, does in fact and have
noticed a few goodies about the weapon.

1. Holds agro VERY well (with taunt of course) even against a 54 monk
w/ IFS (38/40?) and SCHW. Our haste was the same btw but the slower
weapon benifits slightly more from haste. He could take agro with 1hb
but that is never wise from a monk standpoint. One thing to consider
is that warrior base str is almost much higher than monks due to race
and equipment. It does make a difference perhaps enough to even out
the monk damage table. Did have trouble with that pesky ranger
stealing agro though (.
2. It WAS cheap, bottom price on Xev looked to be 10k, now 50k+,
seriously considering selling. That SS BP, or a nice FT item would
look so good on my bard.
3. And heres the good point, my war, with wb, can now solo a bit
better than my nerfed monk. Just standard gear and roughly the same ac
(1080 unbuffed).
4. There is no substitute for the High DPS/ High Mitagation combo in
xp groups. 
5. Lastly there is also no theory in the game, its all hard numbers.
