You are correct, it IS a different game after 50. Its my opinion that
post 50 is the most unbalanced part. Yes - VI concentrates mostly on
the "high level content" because most of the players now fall into the
"high level" category, so they want to continue to provide them with
new content and challenges. Not saying thats a bad thing at all btw.

As we all know, the game was originally released with a level 50 cap.
So the entire mechanics and game world was molded around this cap.
That cap was quickly reached by many. So, whats VI to do? They HAD to
extend that cap. Problem is, the world as we knew it wasnt built to
handle that. To keep player interest, they kept adding more and more
gee-whiz loot and mob bosses and so on. Hence, the end player became
more and more powerful. To counter that, the mobs became more and more
powerful. Its a vicious circle that is spirialing out of control. SO
they keep having to create new encounters that exceed the current
average skill sets and equipment. Of course, to reward those that go
beyond the average, they have to award better and better loot to keep
the players coming back for more. Then... to challenge these players,
harder and harder encounters are needed. It never ends.

Balance is one of those items that is never realized in an online
game. It never will. The only balanced game that exists are the ones
not being played i supposed. Never has there been a period in EQ where
no one has whined or complained about something. Is this bad? I dont
think so - it just shows that the game is continually evolving and
changing - which IS a good thing - or we would all get tired of it
quickly.

Bahh - im rambling....
