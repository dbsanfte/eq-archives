I was wondering if some of the graphic gurus out there might tell me
what the best settings are for a Radeon 9700 Pro video card while
playing Everquest.

Here is my current system:

P4-1.9ghz processor
Intel 845D mobo
1gb DDR SDRAM
ATI Radeon 9700 Pro video card
Turtle Beach Santa Cruz audio
Sony G520 21" Monitor

Here are the settings I'm currently using:

Bios:
AGP Arpiture: 256 megs

Windows XP Radeon 9700 Driver settings:
4X Anti-Aliasing
16x Anisotropic Filtering
Texture Preference: High Quality
Mipmap Detail Level Performance (second notch to lowest)
VSync: App Preference (should this be off?)
Truform: Always Off (should be app pref?)

Everquest Game Settings:
Texture Compression: on
Texture Detail: High
Resolution: 1600 x 1200 x 85 hz
Texture Caching: Off
All Models: On
Social Animations: On
Mip Mapping: On

With these settings the game sure is pretty and for the most part very
playable. The only time I have trouble is when a lot of people show up
at once. The Bazaar, for example, is totally hosed unless I put on the
lowest level of clip plane and even then it's bad. Raiding is also
pretty harsh.

I have heard others say that they can run anywhere anytime with
limited framerate drop but I am not seeing that myself, is there some
setting I am missing?
