You DO take action. the game take over, and do what IT think are the most
appropriate thing to do. Usually its running, but fighers do for example keep on
killing, but dont get XP, and the corpse poofs before it can get looted. My
level 28 troll warrior went LD killing 3 gobbos in IllOmen, my shaman friend was
all right, because i killed all 3 while i was LD.

I have also heard of casters casting spells to defend themselves, should be able
to cast every spell in book, just like when charmed.

The game CAN see if you go LD. But try to think. If im in a fight i cant win, i
just use the /q to go instantly LD and thereby not loose XP. Bad idea.
