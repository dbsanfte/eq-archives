EB is both a chain and a franchise iirc. Franchise EB's don't have to 
carry the same lines the chains do. His may be a franchise that decided 
PC gaming is dead. We have a franchise McDonalds that serves stuff you 
won't find on any McDonalds menu I've ever seen anywhere (Mashed potatos 
and gravy?) and we have a franchise ... urr... one of the media stores, 
I can't remember which one right this instant. It's part of Suncoast's 
empire, because my friend's Suncoast card and gift certificates worked 
there. They don't sell anything but Xbox and Nintendo gamecube games, 
and no music but Rap and Country. (The owner believes he has the only 
game-worthy PC in the county (he's brought it in and we've worked on 
it... wicked geforce 4-mx there buddy), and the Ps2 is dead. I guess 
someone should call all the video game manufacturers that keep making 
new games for it.)
