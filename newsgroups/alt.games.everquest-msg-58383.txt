Heck, put all the Luclin points on some of the more unused zones in the
current realm.

Or better yet, let them do the "wait at the wizzy spires like your waiting
for a boat" thing but maybe add "no wait" portals to Luclin deep in
out-of-the-way zones, I.E.   SK,  Perma,  Lfay,  Stonebrunt,  FV??  Swamp of
no Hope?
