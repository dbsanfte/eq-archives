Submitted for your amusement:  There is an (reportedly Paladin) Ogre and his
girlfriend who lurk in a bar under the EF docks.  My gnome necro is
tolerated everywhere in Freeport (something I'm working to change since
necros shouldn't be acceptable to those folks) and he inadvertantly bumped
into that pair.  They started killing him, he gated.  He was bound at the
soulbinder in EF.  Realizing that this was the same zone and that they'd
soon be after him again, he took off running (unwisely for the desert
instead of North Freeport), but was killed just outside the gates.  Ah,
well, that kinda thing happens.

So he respawns at his bind point.  Just as the pair is walking back to their
bar.  He respawns literally 10 feet in front of them, naked and without
spells this time, thwack, thwack, snicker, snak, dead again.  And of course,
he respawns again in the same place . . .  Now the NPCs are camping *me*!

I broke the cycle by managing to run some short distance away from the bind
point, so the moment he respawned, he saw them walking toward him and he ran
into the Inn, up to the back of the second floor and quickly memmed Invis.
Shivering in that dark corner he felt better, but now he's planning a little
revenge.  (Hey, crybabies, notice that I had fun with it instead of whining
about how unfair life////EQ is.  It's just a game.)
