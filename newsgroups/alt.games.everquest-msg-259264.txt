The sad part is, that is actually one of the better sites selling
information you can get for free. I have seen other so called guides that
have not been updated since 3-4 expansions ago on Ebay.  You have to wonder
about the gullibility and/or ignorance of people that really think they are
buying anything "secret" here.

Came across one a few weeks ago that charged $9.95 just for a list of
links - that oddly enough looked identical to the links list at
http://www.blackslinks.com/
