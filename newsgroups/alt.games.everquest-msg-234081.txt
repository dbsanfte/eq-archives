And they fixed the bug that occurred during a major patch a month or
two ago that eliminated the signon message that you had a reward
waiting and eliminated your reward flag on your account.

After the recent patch, the message returned but /claim didn't do
anything except give a message that the claim was submitted to the
server.

Just tried again to /claim my satchel and it worked fine. got my
satchel. Now need to leave Kurns and do the quest to upgrade it.
