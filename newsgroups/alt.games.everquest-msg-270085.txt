Well, I took a look at macroquest and it's way more involved than it is 
worth to me. I don't want to have to learn to program a macro language 
to automate a bot. In fact the more I think about it the less I want to 
two-box at all. I'd much rather just play the game and have fun that 
way, one toon at a time.

It has occurred to me that one way to maximize the potential benefit of 
the second account would be to do this:

Delete the Beastlord. He's useless.

Delete the nectro trader. He too is useless.

Strip the warrior and move his gear to a newbie warrior on my primary 
account. Bank any gear that has a level requirement for later. Then sell 
sacrifices of him for 200-300k a pop until he's deleveled down to 46 I 
think it is where you cannot sacrifice anymore. I could probably net 
somewhere around 15 to 20k plat doing this.

Do the same thing with the Druid and Enchanter. Sacrifice them all the 
way down to 46 and bank the profit.

Move the enchanter and druid to my primary account. Then deactivate the 
second account and forget about it permanently.

Play an enchanter and druid from level 1 up to level 46 of the same race 
as the ones from the second account. When each hits 46, strip them of 
any gear they have and bank it on the trader then delete them and rename 
the ones transferred from the second account to the same names as the 
ones I'd played from level 1.

The benefit to doing this with the Chanter and Druid is that at level 
46, I can continue to play them up to high levels but they will already 
have their spells up to 65 and 67 respectively in their spellbooks, 
which represents a huge savings in time and expense but takes nothing 
away from my experience in playing each class. And as a bonus, my Druid 
inherits an instant epic 1.0, which while not worth much in it's own 
right, would be useful in jumping ahead a little for epic 1.5 down the 
road. And as somebody above mentioned, the dot it grants might be nice 
in the mid to high 50's until it's replaced by something better in the 
spellbook. And call me silly but I would find some way to max out his 
1hs so I could actually use a scimitar from time to time if I want to.

The account came with 30k. With all the sacrificing of three toons I 
could probably make another 50-75k and bank it. And the savings on 
spells from 46 to 65 would be great. And inheriting the epic would be 
great. But in the end, I would play each toon from level 1 all the way up.

The only downside to this is the expense of transferring two geared 
characters from one account to another account and then later renaming 
those two toons. It's $50. to move two geared toons from one account to 
another account on the same server. And it's another $50. to rename 
them. I just looked that up on EQLive. Hmmm... So it would run me a 
hundred bucks to save on all those spells, an epic and some nice nodrop 
gear each toon has. Something to think about.
