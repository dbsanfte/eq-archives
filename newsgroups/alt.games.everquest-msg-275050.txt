I have seen these small statues in various merchants rooms for awhile, but I 
cannot find which quest they are given from.  The search on Alla2 is down, 
and google only provide locations for her statue in S. Qeynos.

I also seem to recall one room that had 2 statues, although I don't know if 
they were the same statue or not.

Any info on how to get one of these for my room, what quest they are a 
reward for, and any other statues for your room.

Thanks for the help.
