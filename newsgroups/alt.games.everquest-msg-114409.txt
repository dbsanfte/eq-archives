Right!

Don't ever celebrate anything. And for god's sake, don't even think about
being happy for someone else's accomplishment. EQ is all about being a
self-absorbed cynical bastard. Even in the midst of an important event one
must bitch about how it wasn't easy enough, or when witnessing another
person's attainment of a goal, dismiss it as irrelevent becaust it didn't
help *you*.

Anyone who actually enjoys the game (or god forbid enjoys seeing other
people enjoy the game) is a MORON.
