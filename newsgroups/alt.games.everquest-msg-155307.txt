I'm a high 40's mage and I group (3+) 0% of the time - my last group
was pre-level 34 (I do occasionally duo, fairly rare though).

1. I was never more safe in a group than soloing, and, in fact, was
frequently less safe.  The main problem I have found with groups is 1)
lack of proper classes (in particular, no healers) coupled with 2)
"mad" pullers and 3) chronic AFK'ers.

2. I have found group xps stink outside of a zone xp bonus situation. 
I can always get better xps on my own and I actually die less.

3. There is nothing more boring than making idle chatter with a bunch
of people you don't know.  Usually I just sit and try to filter out
all the supposedly humorous jokes and comments followed by "LOL".
