What's the best zone to go to in order to advance
my Smithing kill beyond 175?  And what's the best
"product" to work on?

My Dwarf Paladin can't gate or teleport, so I'd prefer
to find a spot that doesn't require zoning multiple
times between buying supplies and hitting the forge,
as is required for example when buying MQ ore in High
Keep and then getting Fine Plate molds from Freeport.

I have good faction in all "original" world cities
except for Ogguk and Grobb (yes, I actually have good faction
in Neriak), as well as Cabilis, Firiona Vie, and Thurgadin.
