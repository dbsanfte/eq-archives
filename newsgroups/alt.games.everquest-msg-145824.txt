In the patch message they say that harder mobs will give more exp
(yippie!)  But also that lower level ones will give less (BOO!!! BIG
BOO!!!).  Does anyone have the breakdown on what that means?  Do all
blue mobs now give 50% of the exp they used to or something like that?
 Will they add additional blue colors to indicate the experience
penalty of the mob?  Ugh.  I hope they re-evaluate this.
