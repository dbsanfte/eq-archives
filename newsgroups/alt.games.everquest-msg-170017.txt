So, I was twoboxing a 21 cleric and a 20 shammy the other day... The
cleric was healing with the 90-point heal, but she had an Idol of the
Underking (Improved Healing III) So it was healing for 100.

So of course I was seeing the message about the idol glowing with power or
whatever it does, and then I saw a string where that message should be
that was the wrong length.  It said something about the Idol sucking away
my power!  So I checked, and it only healed for 85 points that time.

So... other people with Improved Healing stuff, does that happen often?
Has anyone seen other focus effects noticeably fizzle?
