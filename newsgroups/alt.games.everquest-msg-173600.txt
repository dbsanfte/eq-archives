My recollection (I may be wrong - it's been a while since
I read Eq-bards mailing list) is that the instrument only
helps the hp regen component, but that the mana component
is the same regardless of whether it's sung/played.

G - yes, you can stack it with KEI/32 mana song/SP etc.

Amplification, Cantata, mana, mana, cantata etc until
amp drops and repeat.

Or, for down time with folks who canni/lich -
Cantata/Hymn/Niv's with a good stringed instrument.
