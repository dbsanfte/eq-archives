    You've quoted from two different portions of my response. The "not a
shabby kill rate" part refers to my then level 40-or-so warrior that wears
almost all Crafted, had a Velium Short Blade and a Jarsath Trident, and used
Silver Chitin Hand Wraps for haste (about the same haste as FBSS, but real
stats). Twinked, but not to the point that someone else who wasn't a twink
couldn't emulate her. The only things that made her leave the camp I
mentioned were trains and running out of bandages.

    The warrior in the first part is, of course, a guild warrior and has
more toys than a department store. But surprisingly enough, other than
Primal everything he really uses is obtainable by a level 60 warrior in a
raiding guild (NOT an uberguild). For armour, HoT/Kael/Heraldic. Eyepatch
only has one tough part, Lodizal - the rest is just tedium and jostling with
other people that want the camps. 10th Coldain Ring War has been run by more
guilds on my server than I can name, and shaman DS potions are a viable
alternative if you're rich. Truncheon is a Kunark drop, and tradeable. Heart
of Fungus is a random rare drop off the Caller Quest in FG, which you can
set to low speed and grind all day if you want (and don't want to pay for a
Fungi). It's not just my guild's warriors I see soloing shroom patches in
Fungus Grove, warriors that when asked if they'd like a cleric partner reply
"well, you'd slow my XP down, so no".

    So yes, I do consider warriors to be reasonable soloists. They can't
take down anything big, like a caster can, but they can plow through low
blues for XP like nobody's business. My now-level 45 warrior is soloing in
Dawnshroud Peaks. She is now using the same SCHWs for haste, and has a
Jagged Blade of Mourning (13/25) and the Jarsath Trident (11/22) as weapons.
Her armour is still mostly crafted, with a few pieces removed to add HP gear
(Tattered Shoulders, Crystal Chitin Arms, Dusty Soriz Boots, Skull-Shaped
Barbute). No, not even a Barbed Ringmail BP. She has around 2100 HPs, and an
860-ish AC. She also has a ten-charge SoW potion that my shaman gave her, to
make up for the lack of a bow when pulling (I have a Goranga Idol in
ranged). She plows through large zelniaks (blue, not light blue) as fast as
any of the casters around her, only limited by how many bandages I've given
her (she hasn't raised faction in SH yet). And unlike those casters around
her, passing players can give her buffs that significantly impact her
ability to kill stuff. Jazz - you have a 55 warrior, and access to The
Bazaar to check prices. Does that sound out-of-line for what a "regular,
not-so-ooober" warrior could accomplish?
