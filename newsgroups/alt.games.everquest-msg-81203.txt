|out in today's EQ?

	Class penalties are negated, as you speculated, by multiplying earned EP
to offset the penalty.

	Racial penalties were deemed justified and are still in place.

	EP in groups is divided according to level.  If a level 30 and a level 35
group, the 30 gets 30/65ths of the EP, and the 35 gets 35/65ths.  Class is not
a factor.  There is a bonus for grouping, but it doesn't become significant
until you have many people (5-6) in the group.
