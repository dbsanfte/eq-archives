I've got a 20 bard on FV right now, I can tell you it's a totally
different experience.  From the just of the original poster I think he'd
enjoy it.  I hear very high levels on the market channel talking about
how "raid guilds suck, go away raiders!" all the time.  You can only
have one character on this server, and the loot rules are wierd, you
can't loot any good stuff off of greens, so if you want something from
lower lv creatures your only choise is to pay some newb to get it for
you (unless you've got multiple accounts).  Since nothing is no drop
this is possible.  Because of the single character rule there's not much
twinking either.  It's a fairly low population server, but there always
seemed to be people to group with at the odd times I'm on, probably
because of the roll-playing and almost no one is twinked so they need
help from others ;).  The other annoying rule is no one knows common, so
you can only speak the language (and understand it) of the race you are
to start.  Learning new languages isn't that hard, and there are other
ways around it.  I do have trouble finding groups in areas far from my
homeland since no one speaks my language, so I can't ask them if they
will teach me theirs. :)

I don't play on it much becuase my main is on Brell as well, and I find
a bard really difficult to play due to hand strain, even though I love
it, if they allowed more than one slot I'd play a different character
there as well.
