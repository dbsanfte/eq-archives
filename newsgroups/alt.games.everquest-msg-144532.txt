The reason enchanters are so highely desired on lowbie raids (PoF, PoH) is
basically this -

Your raiding with a bunch of inexperienced people.. and in some cases with a
bunch of complete morons

People haven't all grasped what ASSIST means.. so when the chanter mezzes
and gets pwnt, theres at least another sucker, er enchanter, to cover for
him.

People also have no clue about positioning of mobs, so you get adds that way
too

Your pullers suck ass..  which is to be expected.  When your doing plane
pickup raids your more than likely to be low level, raid inexperienced.  So
the chances of the puller bringing back 10 mobs isnt actually all that
unlikely

The minimum number of enchanters needed for PoF or PoH? Er.. well none to be
honest.
