You are missing something though.  Even if you and the billionaire
start a character at the same time, he STILL has an advantage over
you...he has MORE TIME TO PLAY.  His real-world wealth gives him an
advantage however you look at it.

Think of it this way:  I have a job and a life and a limited amount of
free time.  I also have a garden in my back yard.  I hire a gardener
to maintain the flowers in my yard because I don't have the time.

Who owns the flowers?  Are they any less mine because I did not
actually grow them?  It was my work that earned the money to hire the
gardener.   The flowers are there because I caused them to be there.

Putting it in game terms, if I choose to spend some of my real life
money to buy plats from someone else, how does it differ from hiring
that gardener?  Maybe my limited play time is too precious to spend
farming plats.  I may not have 30 hours to spend camping some rare
spawn, but if I buy an item from the person who HAD the time, have I
not simply hired that person to do something tedious I could not do
for myself?  I earned the money I spent on the item...and it's not my
fault that Sony chose to put the item (in many cases it's an essential
high-level spell) in a spot that requires an army of guildies and a
huge block of time to get to.

If I did not have the job, I would not have the extra cash.  I would,
however, have the extra time to spend in game.  In that sense, EQ is
still the great equalizer.
