A fair amount.  One good place is the National Cryptologic
Museum at Ft. Mead, MD.  The last time I was there, it had
a sizeable display on the Liberty.

Actually, it is relevant.  Regardless of the capabilities of
the ship, it was a noncombatant.  That is what you are ignoring.
This was an unprovoked attack against a noncombatant.  What
about this do you not understand?  The attack against the Liberty
was no different than the attack on Pearl Harbor, and is a
day that will live in infamy for the same reason.

No.  Even in war, it is not legitimate to attack neutral
vessels.  There *are* rules about this.  It was an
open act of war against the United States.

Even were it a legitimate target, which it was not,
the decision to strafe and murder the survivors in the 
water is simply indefensible.

It was attacked because it had observed the Israelis overrun
an air field in the Sinai.  The Arab forces had not realized this.
basese the Arab forces used Soviet doctrine, which the base had been
lostuded strict micromanagement from ground control, the Israelis were
successfully ordering attacking enemy planes to the ground, where they
were immediately captured.  It was a sweet setup.

Because the Israelis feared that our intelligence might be
shared, they attacked our ship and murdered its crew.
