I had this problem.

I run Win 98SE and I had this when using Internet Connection Sharing to
allow me and my wife to play (we had just moved house and we were waiting
for ISDN to be installed).

We tried fiddling with Datarate.txt and all sorts of stuff but to no avail,
whenever I medded (I was the host for ICS, my wife could med okay) or opened
a trade window, the packet loss would shoot up to 70% plus, frequently
disconnecting us unless I stood up frequently (I looked at the lag meter on
my wifes machine to see when I needed to stand up). We could however fight
and run, travel, zone, port etc with no problems, even over a 56k link.

Now we have ISDN installed and we are on separate lines again, I uninstalled
ICS and everything is fine again.

The only thing I could think of was that it was when most or all of the play
screen was obscured (ie looking at the book) so presumed it was some kind of
conflict with the video drivers. I downloaded all the latest drivers
(Directx 8.0a, and the latest drivers for my Geforce2) but nothing changed
the problem.

You have me deepest sympathies if you have that problem, I only had it for a
week and playing a mage under 35 was no fun at all. If you do find a cure,
plet me know in case I need to use ICS again at some point.
