I generally would agree with suggesting a Beastlord as a solo'ing
class.  However, he already has a shaman... Hate to suggest a shaman
take on a beastlord - they will be *very* disappointed at the subset
of the shm spells that come much later in life...

Just my opinion though - I really have no issues with that (but I
don't have a shaman character).
