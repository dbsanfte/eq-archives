1) Yes.

2) Not a clear point - No, almost no one cares about tradeskills

EQ has been on a downward spiral in a frantic rush to cater to the "I 
want to ding 65 when I kill my first rat and have it drop full planar 
armor and my epic" crowd that has come to dominate EQ.

Stick a fork in EQ, it's done.

Too bad WoW is probably still six months away from release. Time to hit 
the cancel button, go outside, and maybe hit the gym to work off the EQ 
butt everyone has been developing over the past four to five years while 
waiting for the next game hit the shelves.
