Bob is an eager boy! 12th Level Nec who has a lot of questions, that
is great.

Let me dip into the well of EQ lore, that is contained in the AGE
heads. Bob, /join serverwide.age:age for in-game AGE help as well.
Make sure we know it is Bob!

Can we come up with cool quests/Items he may like?

Have you done the mask quest in Droga? It starts in PoK with a little
Sarnak BLood.
