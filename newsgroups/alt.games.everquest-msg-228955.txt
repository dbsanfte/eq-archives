At 49, I changed my spec from evocation to conjuration for one reason - pet
canni.  I spent much of my time since then basically wondering if I had made
the right choice because of Lava Bolt, Char, Scars, and Sirocco, Shock of
Fiery Blades and Firebolt of Tallon.  Meanwhile, I used pet canni a lot less
than I thought I would.  When I log on tonight, I'm picking up a ruby and
heading to Ostorm (?) in Lavastorm.  I will be joining the realm of Evoc
mages again.  Given my current playstyle, I probably should have done this
awhile ago, canni nerf or not.
