Hi All

I have been trying test for a while.

The servers are coming down for patching on an almost hourly basis after 
they first loaded the engine.

The best I have seen so far was the PoK library levitating due to the 
ground texture had gone missing.

Finally the Goblin Whelps with very large quarterstaff sized torches. I 
know they wanted to show off the flame graphic. But holding a what 
looked like a flaming tree trunk in just one hand. was silly.

The last time I was on. The crashing had been stopped, at least in the 
Old world. But the sky was still on holiday across the whole server.

So am I getting any of the speed up benefits they were promising

Well on my old abacus of 550Mhz K6-2 and Geforce 2Titanium video card 
and 384MB of memory.

PoK even with only 38 people in it is as laggy as Bistlebanes 190+ 
peopled PoK

The Old world is smoother and less jagged. Signs and textures don't 
flicker as you close on them. But the perception is walking through 
treacle. Smooth yet slow.

Shadeweaver. The effect is amplified you can almost feel the missing 
frames but somehow it all goes by smoothly. Fighting there though is a 
pain. Trying to target anything that is moving is almost impossible. 
When you do start to fight. Visually it seems both sides keep taking 
long breaks then everything catches up again.

If it wasn't for my lagmeter showing almost 0% in both directions I 
would swear it was connection lag I was witnessing.

But it's early days yet. There are still plenty of bugs to go around. 
They even introduced a /rewind command to reverse PC's out of the 
scenery they were getting stuck in.

My best one so far. Opening the door to the bank in Ak'Anon and ending 
up in the wall after somehow running down the inside of the door. The 
world does look funny from the inside.

Oh! /rewind did what it said on the can. It took me back to where I 
opened the door.

No you cannot use it to /rewind a fight your about to lose. (Now I 
wonder who tried that) <grin>
