MMORPGs aren't more expensive than other games to develop.  Take a look at
the post mortems for various games on Gamasutra.  There are a couple of
MMORPGs there.  DAoC, for example, was something like $2.5 million dollars
over 18 months.  That's not more expensive than many single-player games.
There are MMORPGs that have cost more, but that was due to poor budget and
project management, rather than to anything inherent in MMORPGs.
