Well, it was more of a bug they are fixing.   If you looted all items
on your corpse and waited till the game timed out and pulled you off
the corpse (about 2 min) your corpse would be left there with no items
on it, AND, your corpse was bugged so the Rez timer would not count
down.  That way you had more 7 days to get a rez rather than just 3
hours.  So it was really a Sploit (and hell yes I did use it).

Was funny. Id log in my cleric and an long time buddie would send me a
tell... you got time for a couple of rezes?... so he'd take me out to
Tem Deep. and would have a pile of naked corpses on the ground for me
to rez... some with less than a day left... others with the full 7
days.
