  Well, in my case (up until October, anyway--stupid layoffs), it was the 
platform independence. I was working on a product that needed to be able 
to run on Windows NT, various flavors of Unix, and any other oddball 
thing the clients wanted to throw at us. It was a middleware-type 
thing...I won't bore you with the details unless you need a sleep aid.
   The huge standard class library didn't hurt either.
