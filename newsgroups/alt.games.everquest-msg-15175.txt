Strange goings on in the Ocean of Tears. Before the June 5th patch (nothing
to announce, yeah right) I was seeing gargoyles drop eyes at the rate of
roughly 2 for every three gargs killed. This week it's been more like 1 eye
for every 12 gargs killed. Then the other day some hi-level necro comes
along offering me 12p per eye, a 50% premium over vendor prices.

What's up? Is there a new necro quest involving garg eyes so they reduced
the drop rate? VI just decided to cut off the gargolye gravy train? Just my
bad random number generator?
