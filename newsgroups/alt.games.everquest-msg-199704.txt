Turn it around the other way, Graeme.  That one second buys me 30% more
damage for that one spell - but in the time I can cast three Ice Spears, I
can cast four Draughts.  My Draughts do 950, my Ice Spear 1200.  3800 vs.
3600.  Also, the Draughts individually are less aggro than Ice Spears,
allowing me to chain them off with less chance of pulling aggro off that
poor paladin or SK.  If I'm in danger of pulling aggro, make it three
Draughts and a Concussion in the same time as three Ice Spears, less damage
by far but also vastly less aggro.

What I frequently find myself doing where I xp (PoS desert) is dropping
either two Ice Spears or an Ice Spear and two Draughts of Ro on each mob.
With a fairly constant pull rate, sitting on my horse, with KEI, MC1, and
FT1, I can do this without dropping below 70 pct mana at any one time.  This
gives me an okay damage output of 2-2.5K per mob, which I consider pulling
my weight.  When we get a multipull and the chanter is going OOM or the
cleric is saying LOM, I tell the tank to kick taunt into high gear and open
up - 70 pct mana for me in Draughts equals about 8500 damage in 50 seconds
(including recast times).  Is this close to what I can get from Ice Spear?
Probably, but I'd gain more aggro from it.  It ends up in a mob dead fast,
anyway.

Mixing nukes isn't necessary in most casts, as recast time isn't a factor in
the 60s - Draughts recast in 2.5.

Is this the absolute best way to play a wizard at my level?  Probably not.
But it's what works for me, consistently, and it's fun.  Which is what
matters, is it not?
