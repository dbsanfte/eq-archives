What color spells?  And what can you use them for?  My chanter is only 
level 62, so maybe there's something I'm missing, but I quit memming them 
because they have a cap of level 55 and the mobs I'm hunting are higher.

I charm all the time, by the way, normally keeping my pet until I zone out.  
It's dangerous but fun.  My group is used to it and they don't mind me 
outdamaging them once in a while and getting them killed occasionally.  I 
used to charm casters back when I could stun them, but they don't do as 
much damage as melee mobs.
