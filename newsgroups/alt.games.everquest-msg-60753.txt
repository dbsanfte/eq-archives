Allright, I have absolutely reach annoyance-saturation point with the
Soundblaster Live vs. Win2k situation (I get an average of three or four
system reboots per EQ session), and I've decided to do something about
it (of all the fixes offered so far, the only one that has worked with
some degree of reliability is to disable the soundcard altogether),
which unfortunately means throwing money at the problem.

The only solutions I can think of are to buy a different soundcard (but
hopefully one that will output some manner of surround sound), or to
"upgrade" to Windows XP (although I'm not sure whether this fixes the
problems in Win2k, since they seem to share a codebase).

Which solution (if either is a true solution) makes more sense?
