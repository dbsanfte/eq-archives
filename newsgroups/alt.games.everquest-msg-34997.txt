Unless you max bind wounds out at a very low level, the amount
of damage returned over the time it takes to do the binds is dwarfed
by the amount of damage returned by medding during that time and
casting a healing spell.

I suppose if you are OOM, the fight is still going on, and you find you
cannot sit without getting aggro (which forces you to stand up) then
that bandage skill could come in handy... but the odds of all that happening
and bind wounds doing enough healing fast enough to make a
difference seem vanishingly small.

Anyone but a healer, this story would make more sense.  Heck,
perhaps even the "also ran" healer classes might find bind wounds
a handy adjunct.  Cleric, though... learn to fish or something if
you want to spend a lot of time pumping a skill for marginal usefulness.
