I suggest waiting til atleast 16th level before you train a point in
research. Most research spells can be bought in the bazaar, and also most
runes. Some spells require 3 runes to combine.
I managed to combine a level 49 spell with my feeble skill of 54 (lucky
roll), but after you got all your research spells at 49, don't bother to get
more skills in it, as no spells beyond 50 are researchable.

Also suggest you delete your wizard and reroll a mage or druid. As you will
grow to hate the wizard in time, seeing all other classes get new spelllines
that actually work, and we don't. Other classes will get crits etc. Being a
wizard is a waste of time after they nerfed MB, Al'Kabor and added PoT
ports. Only thing the wizard is good for is the TLs after your guild has
raided a zone.
