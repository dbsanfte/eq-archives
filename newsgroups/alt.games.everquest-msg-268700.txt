Basically do all quest the trainer gives you, kill orc boss (grouping
is a good idea for that) and find Ebik's missing parts then leave.

I'm quessing its Ebiks' quest that you are missing that one got me and
isn't very obvious. After you talk to the two people in the beach hut
talk to him on the beach. Find the three items he wants, talk to him
again and you can leave.
