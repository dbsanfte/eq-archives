Try having it in the church in Thurgadin. You only got a couple noisy
dorfs to deal with. Not many passers by. Being a DE i thought the
church in Neriak would be best but not everyone could attend then.

On the other hand, you can try having it in Kedge Keep, The Grey, West
Freeport Sewers or on the Allewesaur Island in OOT. Also, if you buff
everyones FR up real high you can have it right in between SolA and
Temple of Solusek Ro.
