Your epic level encounters sound suspiciously like Kael armor farming
or Fear/Hate raids.

The "current" high end encounters, even if you're not talking about
single boss mob encounter, isn't Kael arena/Fear/Hate.  It would
probably be ToV.  Nothing there is mezzable nor charmable (ok, I lie,
the itty-bitty little baby drakes/wyverns in ToV North might be
dictatable--never really had one of our enchanters try since they die
so fast).

That zone makes enchanters a three spell class:  Shissar + Tash + C2.
Tash so we can double up Tash/Malo/Occulsion and snare the god damn
wurms before they warp all over the zone and bring down the wrath of
god on your raid.

Buffs yes.
Backup healing, not really.

Against big boss mob encounters, shamans and druids can't really do
much in the way of healing damage other than "touching off" AoE damage
(if there's an AoE).

Remember, Velious boss mobs often quad for 600+ and flurry/rampage.
That makes level 60 druid Nature's Touch pretty damn weak in
comparison.  And tossing Torpor on a meleer to heal "riposte" damage
is generally a bad idea.  :-)
