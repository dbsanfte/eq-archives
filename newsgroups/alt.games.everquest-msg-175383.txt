I went from 54-60 in just under two weeks soloing in enforcers and
Punisher's in POJ basement.
Go to the mauvin's hall, and you make amazing exp and amazing loot.
Blue diamonds, diamonds, raw diamonds, ethereal parchments, and other
vendorable loot drops here.

At 54 I HAD to find a cleric to virtue me, but i easily made back the money
i spent on that in one run. It takes a little practice, and make sure to
keep gate up as a panic button, but once you get the hang of it, you can
powerlevel yourself to 60 in notime, and have all your spells by the time
you hit 61.

To get there  from poj, ill try to help....

from graveyard. go down the stairs, take a left or right (its a circle) to
the stairs on the other side.
From here take the hall either way all the way around to the door that leads
to a hall way on the opposite side.
Take a right, and take the second to last door on the left, that leads to a
hallway and some stairs down.
Take a right.
youll pass by a room full of guards, and a then there is a space with a
door, which leads to another door, with an enforcer on the otherside of it.
This is where you camp.

charm the enforcer, mez a punisher, kill the other.
at 55, your mana and enforcer will kill the three mobs in this hallway, then
break charm kill the enforcer, and youll be OOM.

at 61, you can solo all the way to mauvin without running out of mana.

this is close quarters fighting so keep rune5, and berzer strength up
ALWAYS. keep the mob your fighting rooted. and just bang on color stun as
soon as charm breaks.

Hope this helps, its really THE best soloing spots ive found for enchanters
until beckon/COD, and i still use it when i need quick cash.
