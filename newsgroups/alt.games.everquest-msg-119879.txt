GMs are paid employees...and there's like one third of a GM per server or
so. <g>  I doubt if they wouldn't give their precious few GMs the tools
needed to create guilds, and if they do then they would have the tools to
stick themselves IN that guild with no problem whatsoever.

I'll have to ask a guide friend if she knows, but the likelihood of my
remembering is slim. :p
