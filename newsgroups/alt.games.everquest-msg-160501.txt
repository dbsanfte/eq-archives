The grmling mines are easy to solo but unsure of lvl, i was soloing them as
a lvl 60 chanter and we aren't very good soloists. Admittedly after a while
I dire charmed a vampire thing which tore through them like a dose of salts
and I got a fair few windstones. Found a fair few windstones on the cat
vendors also so worth checking.
