Maybe your servers more busy, and they can make enough cash doing it at 10p.
Maybe they just dont think their time is worth as much. Either way, KEI has
to make at least as much money as farming, else I wont be there. Pretty
basic stuff... greedy? lol sorry for not running at a loss so I can KEI you.

Also ignore wont work. No competition. Youd just miss out on KEI and id miss
out on 10p. Bite me.
