As others have said, it makes it almost impossible to balance encoutners for
any group that does not have a slower.   You just cannot design content
which is beatable without slow, but not patheticly easy when you remove 75%
of it's melee damage.

If the mobs are balanced to be challenging when fought unslowed, then
slowing them down 75% makes it an insanely easy, and boring, grind. (See
Kunark and Luclin).   If mobs are balanced so that they are still dangerous
and challenging once slowed... then they have to hit for such obscene
amounts of damage that they are unfightable without slow.   They need to
output 400% of what you think the group should be able to handle in terms of
DPS.  (See PoP and GoD)

Aside from less group diversition, it also means various other problems as a
result.   Sean mentioned pet tanking ability as one.   Charm spells are
another.   Since mobs are doing 400% more melee damage than they really
should, charming them and setting them on another mob is obscenely
overpowered.
