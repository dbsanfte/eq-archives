    I'm now level 61, and the most fun I ever had in the game was around 15,
going into Befallen with my regular group of friends. It was dangerous, it
was pure adrenaline, we needed rescuing 3 times, we had crap equipment and
in hindsight terrible tactics, but it was one of the few times where I've
felt I was actually playing the game. I've had loads of fun at other times,
but that night we ran into befallen I think will always sit at the top. I
hadn't run into a single one of sony's big mistakes by that stage. I hadn't
got jaded about quests that aren't worth doing anymore, or realised that we
would've made our first 25 levels astronomically faster in a zone full of
idiots and alts, or paid good money for expansions that are cool but destroy
all value of the previous content...

    When I finally got luclin and put an alt through PC, my response was
"great, but this is pure bullshit". It trivialises the low end game, and
groups there with no clue whatsoever can triumph, so people learn next to
nothing there. As a 21 chanter I was mezzing 5-6 mobs per pull at one stage,
but couldn't be bothered explaining basic pulling to the complete moron
warrior we had in our group because there was no need and I was having fun
with his massive trains - the only thing that had challenged my chanter's
ludicrous mana pool to date. (he's my smithing alt so he began life with 225
INT) And every melee in the group was whacking on my mezzed mobs. Fine with
me, I'd just recast when they switched targets. Wiping? Who cares? You don't
even need a rez, 2 kills later you've made your experience back.

    I think PC is a significant part of the reason for the "fuckwit factor"
you seem to see these days, where you wonder where the level 55 monk you're
grouping with learned to repeatedly train his groups, or the cleric who
can't heal, or the shammy who wont canni, or... When you make the game too
easy, people never learn tactics. You can kludge your way through
everything, especially with 1 or 2 twinks in the group who know what they're
doing. And when you get from level 1 to 20 in 48 hours played or whatever is
average now, you don't have as much time to learn. Less time, easier
environment = more clueless people making it to their 50's.

    PC needs nerfing. I agree with Lance that it's a great place to PL your
alts quickly, but those of us with the means to PL could do it in a harder
zone. God, PC trivialises the ->25 PL game.

    I met a guy in east commons once. He ran up to me and said "u want to
kill orc"... a brief conversation later I'd decided he was either under 10
or just plain stupid - it wasn't pure language barrier. Later I noticed the
group he was with at the orc camps wasn't doing so well. The only other time
I saw him in the game was in oasis, where he was shouting to the whole zone
"wheres my corpse". I know these pearls of wisdom were written in caps, but
the game helpfully fixed at least that. I never saw him again, and I believe
the reason is that EQ without luclin, at that stage of the game, was too
hard for idiots to play and enjoy. Maybe that's why PC has survived the nerf
railgun - the whole mass market thing.

Cheers,
James
