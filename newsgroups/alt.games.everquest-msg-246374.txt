   I'm probably going to pick up the game tomorrow.  But I dunno what
server I'll be on yet.  I'd love to have a chance to meet and play with
other agers.  Figures you'd all run off and join various servers from the
get go.

   Lenny will be on also.  He's just kinda bumming that right now, it looks
like you can't play a villain instead.
