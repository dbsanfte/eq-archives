You can't see the difference between going and getting an item or
getting a group of friends to go get an item and searching for someone
just the right level to get the item and pl'ing them in exchange for
the loot that drops?  

Let me speak slowly here. The TCC adds NOTHING to the game that cannot
be achieved using already available means. So let me reverse the
question. What is the benefit of the TCC? Does it reduce farming? Hell
a no drop and lore tag will do that and far better. 

Does it limit items to low levels? No because the aforementioned
Powerleveling in exchange for items will occur wherever the item in
question is good enough to warrant it.  

Does it waste valuable bank space (assuming the future quests are
designed like the current ones, ie Crystalized sulfer used in a mid
teen level quest)? Yes unless the quests are designed perfectly and we
all know Verant's record on that don't we. 

Does it place artificial limits on long term players? Yes. 
Are limits a good thing when there is no need for them?

Many times in EQ's history the choices of the players have been
limited in the name of The Vision(TM), yet this is the first real time
that the explanation given has not even a shred of believability to
anyone familiar with the game in any way.
