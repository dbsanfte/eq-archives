>Congrats!  How large is the guild you're in, anyway?

About 40 folks all told, though we usually get about 18 on a night.
Nobodys a hard core exp grinder, we usually take it easy and explore
most of the places that the crowds avoid.  We range from level 18 or
so to 57, although we've had a few that outgrew us, went uber, and are
now 60 and in larger guilds.

As it turns out, we now know the effect of the Propylon is self only,
15 sec cast time gate to the nexus.

So far no druids or wizzys can buy port spells to get there, so its
not a bad effect, but if these spells are eventually purchaseable then
the effect is pretty lame.  It was still a fun event and a cool +magic
neck is always nice to have.
