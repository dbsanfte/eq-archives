I went and tested this; and selos song of travel (bard speed plus invis 
plus lev, which I happened to have memmed) broke charm quite readily.

I can't say for certain that this includes all forms of invis, but I 
wager it does, and that they meant summoned when they said summoned.

But I've been playing EQ long enough to know that you can't just go by 
what they say, you need to go check for yourself before you get into 
trouble assuming that you'll be find.
