One thing I hate about the current eq interface is that, in a battle, it is
just about impossible to see what my other group members are saying.  The
battle messages fly by so fast that when I see a line of group chat, I have
to furiously scroll back to see what it was.  The task is even made more
difficult by the fact that the battle messages continually push the text up
while I'm trying to find and read it.

I know about the options to reduce the amount of battle chat and I use them
all.  That doesn't seem like a great solution since I can no longer see how
my comrades are doing.  There have been times when I'm looking in one
direction completely oblivious of the fact that the other tank is actively
fighting something behind me because I have all the other battle messages
turned off. And when I am fighting, I still get a huge amount of messages
since I have two fast piercing weapons, am hasted, and have thorns.

I think it would be a huge help if they could add a separate window which
only held non-battle messages.  The way I'm thinking is that the normal chat
window would still have all the messages and would be the place people use
to type in messages.  That window would work exactly the same as it does
now.  What they need is an additional window which only holds the non-battle
messages. Stuff like tells, group chat, auctions, etc.  So chat messages
would appear in both windows, but battle messages would only appear in the
normal window.  The chat message window wouldn't need to have support to
enter messages. It would be view-only and just need the ability to scroll.
I think it would even be fine if the chat-only window was just in the
improved interface.

One thing I've noticed about battles is that no one says anything that is
not a message of critical importance.  There is very little talking or
kidding around.  I know that I don't say anything light-hearted during a
battle because I know that everyone in my group will have to scroll
backwards to see what I just said.  If there was a separate window where the
chat messages would stick around, people could hold a normal conversation
during a battle.  Or how about the enchanter who wants us to start hitting
on a different mob.  As it is now, I only see the message for .000025 of a
second before it flys off the top of the screen.

I've tried submitting this to the developer's corner on everquest.com but it
must have gone into a black hole or something.  Does anyone know if they
have any plans to add an additional chat window?
