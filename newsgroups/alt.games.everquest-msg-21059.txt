I have a 27 Wizard on Drinal, and he is both a master fisher, and master
baker. Granted that was done before he even hit 20, so I burned a lot of
"PLAY" time learning tradeskills.

I have found that If I offer 5 fish rolls (weight 0.5 and last same length
of time as a whole stack of breat that weighs 12.0) for Sow, Clarity,
Breeze, etc, I am a lot more likely to get it. Why because I have offered
something useable to the caster in trade.

So learn fishing, and baking, make fillets, or fish rolls, and enjoy!
