My girlfriend and I have been playing EQ for about 4 months now and we
have decided that we would like to start a pair of characters that we only
play with each other until at least lvl 45.  Is it possible to only play
with a group of two and get to at least lvl 45?  Higher?

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what race/class combinations go
best together in a two person party all the way up to lvl 45?
I was thinking Woodelf Ranger/Highelf Enchanter or Barbarian Shaman/Human
Monk.  Any other suggestions?

Thanks in advance for your advice,
Andy
