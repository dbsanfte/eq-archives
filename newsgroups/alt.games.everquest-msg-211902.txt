I don't normally snare unless no one else in the group can.  There's a
60-something ranger in my guild who pulls with it ... I don't see the sense
in it, but he's in his 60's while I'm in my 40's so he may be on to
something I don't know about.

Weps are another issue.  I'm running with a Lammy/Green Jade Broadsword at
the moment.  I know the Lammy generates a lot of hate, but I didn't think
the GJBS was a big hate inducer.

I don't recall ever seeing the pally stun.  I believe I'll bring that to his
attention ... thanks for that.
