It is painfully easy compared to most of the key quests in EQ.

One zone is involved, Trakanon's Teeth.  You need a drop off two mobs,
both of which spawn commonly in the zone, and always drop their items.

A tracker makes this rediculously simple, find a Froglok Forager and a
Froglok Hunter, kill them, loot their medalions.

Then run along the wall to the hand in guy.  This part can be a bit
scary, since you end up crossing a graveyard full of undead, but if you
go in the correct cave, there's a spider web hanging there that the
undead won't pass.  Give the emperor your medalions and get your key.

Elapsed time per person, about 10 minutes.

Its so easy that when a group is getting ready to go to seb and a
potential member says "I dont have a key" the most common thing to do is
to just take the ten minutes and get him one, assuming there's a tracker
in the group (ranger, druid, bard, it doesn't have to be a GOOD tracker)
