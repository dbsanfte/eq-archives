> A simple question. Why do an important raid on a patch day?

[snobby uberguild mode: on]

Well the answer is easy:

Verant/SOE should set up an cental raid site that all guilds must
document their planned raids.   Patches will not be performed on
or around those days.  Guilds are the backbone of EQ.  They should
be catered to with no expense spared.

Also, Verant/SOE should designate one employee to every 5 guilds
to check their MOTD, website, officers etc to make sure that a patch
isn't planned on the day the guild just might do something like 
raid MM for their lower levels.  Cater!

Additionally, Verant/SOE should also log on periodically to each 
area of the game and do a "/shout camp chk!" and if anybody replies 
(except for in DL) then they can not take the server down.

It's a simple as that.  We pay $12.95/mo and *DEMAND* a playable game 
or else we go to DAoC or AC2!  Some of us have 4 accounts because
sometimes we need 3 more Shamans!

;-)

Any word as to what the major malfunction was that forced them
to do THREE patches, one of them during prime time?  Guess it was
such a big problem that they couldn't wait another 5 hours to
put it on!
