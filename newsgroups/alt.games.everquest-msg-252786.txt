At 51, Boots of the Mosquito would be better - they are usable from
the inventory and don't require you to target yourself.  The second is
particularly valuable, saves on the annoying retargeting and
embarassment when you forget.

Hard to buy for pp, though.

Other things, assuming you don't already have them:

Thunderous Drum of Karana, the best droppable drum there is, very
useful when chant-kiting.

Singing Steel Helm (or Holgresh Elder Beads, faster but much much more
expensive), for free Eye of Zomm.  Very useful to scout.

Illusion masks (Iksar Hide Mask, Mask of Obtenebration, Flayed
Barbarian Hide Mask, Mask of Tinkering), which aren't terribly useful
but lots of fun.
