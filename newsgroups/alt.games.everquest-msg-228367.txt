For what its worth, I'm pro world-game , I enjoyed the exploratory
slog of EQ, the pain of death, the size of world, all those
immersive traits, and have now quit after four years.

And I still think you're not only doing badly at explaining
yourself, but doing very well at being obnoxiously rude. Simply
screaming 'I'm right and you're not worth talking to' is only
going to fail to convince anyone reading who isn't already in
your choir. I'd be amazed if it got more than a cursory glance
from any wandering MMORPG devs too.

The problem being that you either police it so hard you have the
objective of 'real world' policing - that of obliterating the
behaviour - such that it never happens, and you just expend copious
resource on it when a gamey rule could just stop it, or you police
it laxly for the 'joy' of it happening and those who hate it still
get ganked, and hate it.

Whatever gap you leave for a real person, caught up in emotion and
rivalry to exploit for justifiable world enhancing vendetta will be
exploited like hell by griefers. Disposable toons, guilds reinforcing
reps, hardcore rule lawyers, whatever it takes.

I dont see how the issues you outlined are worldly though. If I'm
a level 12 fighting a grizzly bear, and I'm at 15% health, and a
level 20 starts to hit me in the wilderness either 'game rules'
spring in to even up the fact he's jumped me while I'm fighting,
or I get ganked, or completely unrealistic immersion breaking 'worldy
game rules' spring in - be they mysterious bounties, sudden appearance
of guards, or whatever.

I think theres a place for PVP games... I'm just not sure they'll
be mainstream. I like the idea of PVP. I like the idea of the
immersion and the risk. But, I remember in early EQ, the constant
ooc screaming on rallos zek of people harranguing one another.

The worldy solution, the immersive solution, is that I get 0wnz0r3d
and die. The problem is, that sucks in a world of nutballs, and
nobody pays to play policeman 24x7 keeping them in line.

'This is a PVP server d00d dont play if you dont want to die'
'omgz0r why are you hunting me?'
'This is a society. We punish murderers, like any society does.'

It wasnt even a 'game' issue or a 'rule' issue at that point, nobody
knew the game well enough to really be pushing the rules issues
that hard, it was a world of newbies. It was, and will be, a player
issue. The griefers and 'tards get attracted to the PVP areas and
turn them into cesspits.

To paraphrase someone else... PVP players keep bemoaning that the
fact nobody wants to play in their world. The reason is because
they've tried that world, and it sucked.

There are turn based PVP games out there. There are twitch based
PVP games out there. They never manage to maintain a world beyond
'look how cool I am' because they end up attracting people whose
escape from real life is to descend into the powerful persona of a
blood crazed murdering asocial psychopath.

Well. Games of any scale do. Small scale games, MUDS, or groups
of peers, or pen and paper RP can survive. But thats a different
kettle of fish to a mass market massively multiplayer systme.

You're really not doing well at appearing anything other than a
caveman who's smacked himself in the head one too many times with
his own club in this post, Ben. And usually, you're far more literate
and agreeable.
