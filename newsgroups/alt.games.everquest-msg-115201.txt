FYI, the Highpass Lottery Ticket is part of the
Paladin-only quest, for the Shield of the Silent
Watch (No Drop, AC 10, WIS+10, can be equipped in shield
or back slot).

Doing the Hallard part of the quest over and over
(repeat 9999 times) again is the most tedious,
annoying part of the quest, since you have to do it
until Hallard randomly gives you the winning lottery
ticket (it's the only one that starts with the
digits "16..."), and he doesn't give it out often.

If you're a Paladin and get this ticket, go do the
rest of the Silent Watch quest, it's a pretty decent
back item, the quest is fun, and has a good story.

If you're not a Paladin and get this ticket, but
know a deserving Paladin, you can use the ticket
to multi-quest part of the quest for your Paladin
friend.  Turn it in to the treasurer (*not* the
banker) in High Keep, and she'll give you a key.
The key opens the locked door to the next quest NPC
upstairs in High Keep, and the Paladin can take it
from there, up until the final turn-in, which
requires the key to be handed in with a few other
items.  Turn the key in first, then have the
Paladin turn in the rest for the shield.

Note:  You'll have to have pretty good faction
with the locked-room NPC in order to successfully
finish the quest (MQ'ing or otherwise).  If he
responds appropriately to his trigger phrase
(something to do with the sky or clouds), you're
good.  Otherwise, don't try to finish the quest
until you raise your faction standing enough.

WARNING:  Since you'll no longer have the key
to the room, you'll be locked *in* after the
quest is completed.  And given how tedious it
is to get that key, odds are you won't be able
to find any players who can unlock the door to
let you out.  Make *sure* you have a druid or
wizard along to get all of you out of the
room at the end.  The quest NPC in that room
is a skeleton, don't end up like him.
