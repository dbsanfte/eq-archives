This is pants down the best name.  It didn't make it past the name filter,
but next time I am PLing him I'll petition and hope it will get approved.
It comes close to violating 2 of the naming policy rules.

3.Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin (e.g. Jesus,
Allah, Satan, Stalin, Angel, Devil, Demon).

and

9. Names containing titles within them, such as, but not limited to: The,
Lord, Lady, Master, King, Knight, Sir, Father (e.g. Sirtallon, Lordeagle,
Mothermaggy, Darksister).

Either one is kind of shady in regard to this name.  I think if I got an
actual GM to talk to and explained the context I would get it.  Chances of
talking to a GM seem slim, but here is hoping.  Thanks everyone who replied.
