    The display limit on a vendor is now 80 items, and the absolute maximum
is 90 items (go beyond 90 and further items are sent to oblivion when sold
to a vendor). Even in off hours there's 6000 items for sale in The Bazaar on
my server. 75 merchants minimum? No ability to search for items except by
checking every merchant? Ick.

    Verant doesn't care if others can sell better than you because they have
better internet access than you, and they never will. They don't care how
much time people can plow into EQ, just as long as the account fees keep
coming in.

    See the display limit above. And that display limit won't change, as
it's the global vendor display limit - changing it beyond 90 requires extra
memory to be added to every merchant in the game. The Bazaar is a wonderful
tool as-is. The only thing I'd love to see extended from the Bazaar engine
is the Bazaar search option. If that was extended so it could search NPC
merchants as well as PC vendors, and was then usable in all zones, I'd be in
heaven.
