Others already explained the attempted proc message.  As to the fact
that you are missing more than before, what weapon were you using
previously? Remember, that there are different weapons skill "types" for
the various weapons you can find. Hammers are either one hand blunt
(1HB) or two hand blunt. (2HB). Most swords will be one or two hand
slashing (1HS and 2HS). There are also piercing weapons.  To hit
efficiently you have to have your skill up high in that weapon style. 
If you were previously using a different type, and you didn't dump a
bunch of training into this hammer's weapons type, then you may be
fighting with a VERY low blunt skill, and not hitting very often. Look
for messages during the fights saying, "You've gotten better at One Hand
Blunt! (47)" or some number. That will tell you your skill in that
weapon type.  The max you can have for a skill is listed at
http://www.castersrealm.com/ under the druid section.
