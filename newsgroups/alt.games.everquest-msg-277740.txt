The ticket is from the Harbourmaster near the bells and is for 1 trip only 
AND, you cannot zone (other than to EL or ZEK) or camp or you will lose the 
ticket.  You must buy it when you are ready to go, you can't keep it for 
later.  The ticket cost 60s.  To use it, you click the 3rd bell on the docks 
labeled "Voyage by Sea" IIRC.

Hope that helps.
