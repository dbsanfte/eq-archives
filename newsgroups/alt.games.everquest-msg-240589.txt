Sounds good to me. :)  I'd bow to other's authority on that.

}And you would still bet on necro even though mage can nuke for 1.4k
}(this is in the case of owners helping out in duel)?

Aye.  How much of that 1.4K can the necro lifetap back before the mage 
gets the next one off without being resisted?  I don't actually know, but 
between that and all the messy dots the necro can drop on ya, I just think 
Dr. Death is coming out on top.

It would be pretty close, regardless, and ultimately it would come down to 
"the one who can play their class better", but I think there's a necrotic 
edge here.  The necro can get back mana and health in ways that the mage 
simply can't.
