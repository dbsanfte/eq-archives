 I actually did a raid with a 55 Necro a few nights ago and I have to say
that I was very impressed with his dicipline. But then again, I also did the
LDoN with a 50 Shammy and regreted it because of his pet skills.
 As far as my 52 SK and my pet, I only cast him when we get restless and
need something to laugh at. He damn sure can't fight.
