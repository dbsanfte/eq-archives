hey,

(sorry)

i had 2gb of ddr 500 ram and wanted to upgrade to 4gb (it was on sale and 
it'll help 2 or 3 of the main things i do with the comp...like multiboxing 
eq)

i bought another pair of the same ram i had ... but when i installed it, the 
system crashes every 10 min or so

what i tried was: changing the rate to 1t, 2t, and leaving it at auto ... 
clearing cmos ... switching the sticks around to rule out any damage to the 
sticks...ripping hair out

i had to take the extra out of the system and it's sitting on the desk ... 
what could be wrong? what do i do?

stats:
win xp pro w/ sp2
abit at8 mobo (supports 4gb)
gskill pc4000 ram (2x 1gb)
(what else is relevant to this?)


thanks in advance
