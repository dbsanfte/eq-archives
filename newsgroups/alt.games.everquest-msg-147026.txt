By "group" you mean a group of 30 people, right?  Otherwise, there's no
fighting to the entrance.  

It's possible to run there solo with invis if you are +CoV and there are no
named up.  I recommend not trying this until you know there's a necro online
that can summon your corpse if anything goes wrong.  And the chances of
something going wrong are fairly high.

www.planeofmischief.com answers most of the rest of your questions.

I fought there some.  Gave it up as an utterly lost cause.  That zone needs
some serious tuning.
