Perhaps true, I haven't done the dungeon time.  But really if no one is
complaining that isn't the issue.  If that is the system in place and it
works, I wouldn't be ranting about it.  I am speaking more to a particular
type of camp and a particular level most likely.  I'm sure jerks come in all
races, creeds, genders, and even levels, but hopefully most will get
frustrated or bored and move on to something else that stimulates them.

I have more a problem with (aside from my prior rant) some one or group
holding a spawn, camping it kill after kill after kill after kill, when
someone else wants a piece of the action.  Now we can be reasonable too.  No
one (lets do extremes) level 1 player should be asking for level 20 action.
Heck, other wise let him get killed just for fun.

I think it is reasonable to, take the Highpass Hold Orcs, to share the camp,
alternating kills in some fashion, or come to a mutual agreement.  I don't
think it would be fair, or at least nice, to camp those orcs for hours and
hours, day after day.

I know the easy answer MAY be just find another camp... or tough.  I would
accept that.  But I shouldn't catch a lot of flack for asking...
particularly if I do it politly (and in full sentencem mind you).

My rule of thumb for myself is;
(1) Whoever was there (and I mean still there) owns the camp, in that
his/her say should carry the most weight.

(2) If it is a group spawn and the pickins are pretty slim elsewhere, it
should not be unreasonable to ask to share a camp or alternate... or agree
on a time to stop and switch up.  But, again, if they were there and they
have been there the longest I will respect the positional authority...
though I may not agree with it.

My big beef earlier was primarily that THAT WAS MY CAMP.  I don't care if
Varant, Guides, or GM's enforce any camping policy.  Just common couresy and
respect should be a basic element.  I was there the longest.  I never
left... I was the right level and prepared to do battle...  Why should
anyone be able to stroll in and KS.  Granted as a level 12 Cleric he didn't
have much chance of that, but still his whole attitude burned me up.

I wish Thornbark nothing but ill luck with EQ and any of his/her other
endeavours!!
