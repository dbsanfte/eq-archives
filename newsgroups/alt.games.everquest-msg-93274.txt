I am just starting my halfling cleric and am beginning to research the 
diety-specific armors and arms that shall be available to me as a 
follower of Bristlebane, the god of practical jokes.  Not sure what I 
will fine, but I think I shall make a few suggestions as to some 
"practical joke" effect type of items that SHOULD be avaialable to 
followers of Bristlebane:

Funny or shocking illusions:  Perhaps rat or bunny as that has not been 
done before.  How about a micro-sized huge monster or a troll of ogre 
for the pure absurdity of it all.

Funny imitated death:  Does not need the feign death usefulness, just a 
look to make people gasp then laugh.  Something like fire engulfs you 
then you knock over for a while.

Being able to turn mobs into funny-looking critters

Super goofy-looking items, or absurd looking items.  How about a "rat's 
head" helm?

Useless stupid-looking pet:  something that would summon a pet equal to 
your level but with one hit point and no offense/defense capabilities.  
Needs to be equal to users level so everything does not aggro on it.  
All that matters is the pet looks real funny

...use your imagination
