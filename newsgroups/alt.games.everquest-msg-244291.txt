Then you would be incorrect. I feel there are two people.. those
people that try to jump up and down on the game to discover
bugs/sploits they can use to generate massive amounts of pp to sell on
sites... and those that use the bazaar and resale of items from in
game to generate massive amounts of pp they can sell on sites. Usually
when a bug/sploit hits, the former and their close friends are the
ones to get the advantage, while the latter are too busy
selling/buying to notice unless they get notified from a close friend
in the first group.

Personally, if you were in the first group.. instead of trying to cash
out before everyone else drives the pp price down, you would be better
served taking that free pp and investing in items bought from the
second group. This is why when the Befallen banker hit you suddenly
saw people buying every Blade Of Carnage, SoD, Fungi, CoF, and
whatever high priced item they could get their hands on.
