Yeah. I mean, I can understand having some sort of eligibility system
to prevent people from only jumping in on one out of ever 100 raids or
something like that, but, 60% minimum is a bit harsh, IMO. I'd say
even 30% of raids is a reasonable amount in a guild that raids
regularly.

Some guilds forget that their members might actually have more
important commitments IRL. You know, family, job, trivial little
matters like that...
