Ah, as I suspected. It was a "compromise" in terms of, "we could take
anything we want, but we'll give you what we classify as a 'shot' if you
do it by our terms."  Then again, if you are a FCFS server, then such an
agreement was pointless. If it's rotation, then otherwise. If it's FCFS
you should have just blocked them.

"Dictat" (lovely if Freudian... he he) but continue. :-)

I'll shut off your dictat .... errr.. agreement right there. Who's to

That's right. The number one and two guilds on the server can.

I'm not saying you can't, James. Just own up and admit that if you're
going to dictat ... err... command everyone how they can try a mob, say
so. :-).

If they split the loot amongst themselves after saying you could have
the loot, then you certainly win on that point, as I said before. You
deserved the loot, so they should pay up. There was no agreement about
them not getting flags, though. They killed the mob and got flags. In
the end, that's what we're talking about. Not any piece of loot.

You're seriously going to take a stand saying who should farm what for
what? It's still for personal gain, whether "personal" means each
member, the guild, or the asshole that's ebaying.

You should say that person should have their account banned. And I'd
support you 130%.

Again. Totally shitty. The people doing it should be shunned, deguilded,
petitioned and banned. Doesn't seem to affect our conversation of their
alliance getting flagged, though.

This is the one place where we *might* come to a meeting of the minds.
What specifically was specified where your guild dictated who could and
couldn't go? If a smaller guild needed some help, where does your guild,
as the rulers of who can and can not go to the elemental planes, draw
the line? If four of their nine clerics lose Roadrunner connection and
two clerics from another guild fill in, does that violate your rules of
how PoP shall be handed out? If they want an ally to help them get
flagged does it? (Oh, wait. Yes, it does. You already said.)

Dunno. First of all, I'm too lazy to go back and search the post history
but 15 months seems a bit long, but let's say you're right. Secondly, I
was in two guilds since Christmas 1999, and just got tagged as a probie
in my third one in January. So yeah, I'd say so. Any other questions? I
was guilded and fighting bigger shit than you could in pick up groups
long beforehand. I remember our chats about that well, James. I also
remember your accusations after I'd already been raiding with my warrior
(before I even stared my current 61 wizard) that *I* was the fucking
reason you joined an uberguild when I asked why you weren't soloing and
bashing guilds anymore. Or does that now evade your uber memory?

Ok. Second best on server. Still Tier one. Excuse the fuck out of me.
Put in perspective of relative server position and power for the content
available at the time, a difference in semantics only.

I'll snip and spare everyone a repeat of the justification. Bottom line
is, if you kill a loot giving boss mob, it's for the loot. If a
"lowbrow" guild does, it's to try to cut into your action.

Zerg my ass. You do what you can with what you have. We've had this
discussion on my server recently. Who determines what the max number for
an encounter is? If your guild only needs fifteen people to do AoW and
25 are online when the mobs are available, do you tell ten to go xp and
fuck you, you can't come? We'll look like we're zerging? No. You don't.
And PoP changes all that. More people on AoW means less people to get
loot. More people on PoP boss/flag mobs means more people to get
flagged. You take who you need to get flagged and you already know that
fucking damned well. (Limited flag mobs like on tier two excepted, of
course.)

I'll ask again, even after all this bullshit. I'll give you that they
owe you some loot. They killed the mob. They got flagged. Why don't they
deserve to be sharing the elemental planes with you? All I hear so far
is a "Fuck, we didn't cockblock them fast enough".
