OK, I got my heat issues from upgrading to an AMD 2100+ squared away.  Now
I'm having a problem with EQ.  I get dropped to the desktop often, and
occasionally my whole system just reboots.  DXDAIG shows nothing.  However,
in checking my DBG.TXT file in EQ folder I keep getting a #628 error.  In
checking with others in game, EQ chat room, and in tech support area of
eqlive.com others are having the same problem.  From the few that have
posted their DBG.TXT file the two constants seem to be the #628 error and
listing the processor as AMD.  This never happened with my 700 Mhz PIII.
It's been happening since I upgraded (which was the day of the last patch)
and others have been getting kicked frequently since the last patch.  It
sounds like there's a nasty de-leveling bug and one that gets you stuck in a
zone as well.
Hmmm....hopefully this is temporary, but if any other AMD owners are getting
kicked more often they should drop a note to Sony about this matter.
Hopefully it gets fixed soon.

Later,
SEAN...
