I still think HP > all, even when you can get Temp.

If you can get Dex to around 120 unbuffed early on, there's marginal 
benefits to getting it much higher, and you can get it higher with buffs 
if you're PLing anyway.

Yes, defensive :)  Same advice as for Dex.

Troll or Dwarf purely because at the end race doesn't matter that much 
and I prefer those two classical races.

You don't need to snare mobs that are social, because they won't run 
until there's only one left, so you don't always need undead.  You could 
for example just pulling enough orcs so that only the last one runs. 
Generally it's a pain though so undead make it easier (although some 
undead do annoyingly run).
