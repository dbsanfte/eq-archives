I don't see it as a nerf. 

If a bard twists Mana(CCC)/Haste/Other in combat the mana song would
only hit once every 3 ticks while the other two songs hit every tick
as long as the twist isn't interupted. This makes the song only 1/3 as
effective as the other songs in the twist. Further it forces bards to
click constantly to pulse the mana durring downtime to get the most
mana regen possible. 

I really hope they put an icon in with the changes. Then I won't need
a "I'm already playing it" macro :-P
