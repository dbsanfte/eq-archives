They are *games*. What benefit do you exactly expect from them, other 
than to entertain you? What are the benefits of movies, or stage plays?

Not me, for one. I'll start, in fact, by challenging the very "more and 
more" premise. The growth of online games appears to be, in fact, going 
flat pretty quickly. Estimates of the number of players made at the time 
Everquest came out have turned out to be *wildly* optimistic.

Actually, reports of the size of the gaming industry, as compared to the 
movie industry, for example, are also wildly exaggerated.

So, the *biggest* game publisher in the world compares well with the *
tenth* biggest movie studio? Fair comparison, right there.

*Whose* research? Made *when*? And even if accurate, which is very 
doubtful, that's what, the cost of a stealth bomber and a case of beer?

Which, again, it's... well, not peanuts, but the bacteria lurking among 
the grains of salt on the peanuts, compared to something like 
professional soccer.

Sorry, but when you say "it's quite obvious", you are no longer 
presenting facts, but opinions, which I'm happy to disagree with. I 
don't necessarily think Western politicians act rationally all the time, 
or even much of the time, and I'm sure the same is true of Thai 
politicians, of which this I would probably regard as an example.

If a game can take the place of someone's "real" social participation, 
then that person's "real" social participation was deficient to start 
with. If the games were that powerful, *everybody* would discard their 
social lives, wouldn't they?

No, actually the *reason* was that person being a bad parent. EQ may or 
may not have been involved. I tend to take the allegations of defense 
lawyers with a lot more salt than your average packet of peanuts (to 
unnecessarily stretch an earlier metaphor).

Actually, as an EQ player, I'd rather SOE invested some of the revenue 
on more free expansion zones and interface enhancements. My problem, you 
see, is that I'm actually playing *too little* to justify the monthly 
fee I'm paying.
