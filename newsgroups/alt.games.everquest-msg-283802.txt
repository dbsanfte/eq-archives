Well the dps of a necro (thinking they are sooooo needed for damage) doesn't 
mean a whole heck of alot when the whole group dies. Let the tanks tank and 
do the fighting. The cleric must be kept healthy to keep the group alive. No 
point in adding to a kill if your cleric is suffering... everyone dies.
