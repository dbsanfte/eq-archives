Just /petition immediately.  As others stated, /report does little at best.
On Drinal, we had somebody in NFP trying to sell their account.  Once people
started /shouting that they were basically not welcomed and was  being
/reported, who basically started /shouting "FUCK ALL YOU *IGGERS!".  A few
of us /petitioned and had a GM there within the next few brilliant
statements by the donkey in question.
That took care of it pretty quickly.  That's the best thing to do.
