Dont let the fact that I might get you nerfed cloud your judgement mister
hunter. My track record for rightness is pretty damn high :p You will notice
druids DID get a heal 5 times better than they had. It was needed.  They DID
take out trivial loot code . They WILL fix monks as soon as they get there
head oughta there ass and actually do the testing.

Its not hard just run a simple 6 man group with 2 pure melee . Try
warrior-rogue , warrior-warrior, rogue-rogue , and the 3 monk combinations.
You will notice which does the best and which 3 do the worst. If they where
a little lazy they could have asked the chanters and clerics first before
they started breaking eggs. As it is they will just have to wipe the egg off
and go on :p
