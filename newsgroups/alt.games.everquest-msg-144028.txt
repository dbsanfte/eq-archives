I'd like to add to your point that if the mob wanted to use the teleporter
to get down there he could have except for the fact that the programmers are
not that good.  That he warped rather than use the porter does not seem like
an exploit.  Just because the programmers did not think to allow mobs to use
teleporters does not say that the mobs should not be able to travel where
they obviously *want* to.  The only exploit is on the part of Verant.
