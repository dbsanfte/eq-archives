I don't know about the most broke class, but my 40 monk sure is poor.  Can't
carry out good loot without a tink bag.  Can't get a tink bag without
getting good loot.  It's a vicious cycle.  Maybe I'm just missing something.
I suppose I can write it off as involuntarily role-playing my vow of
poverty, hehe.
