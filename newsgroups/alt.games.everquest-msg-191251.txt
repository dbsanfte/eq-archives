That's usually a big problem with any app that basically "locks" your system
(like when zoning in EQ) and does a port change at the same time. It's
"supported" by Windows but it's a stupid idea; however, how else do you get
around moving a user to another node in a cluster, you mioght ask? A lot of
people have, and I still can't figure out why programmers haven't figured
out how to assign * one * port to a user across the cluster and keep it
until they log. DUH! It's not like the IP protocol doesn't allow for enough
ports.
