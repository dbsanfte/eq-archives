Hi there,

In the past couple of months I posted questions about upgrading my
computer's video card but through much trial and error have ended up
deciding not to do it.  Instead I will get a computer more suited to
gaming a few months down the road.

My computer has an integrated video card and a  300 watt power supply
that cannot be upgraded without upgrading the motherboard as well and
invalidating my warranty.  I downloaded EQ from my old discs in the hope
I may be able to play them a little bit at low settings until I can get
a new computer.  As I pressed the "play" button I was hit with the
"...cannot find the d3dx9_30.dll file" which I was expecting because I
had gotten this message with my old computer (with a dedicated video
card), downloaded it then, and everything went fine.  My question is if
I download this d3dx9_30.dll file on an unsupported (for EQ) integrated
video card is there a chance it could harm my computer ?  My specs are
below:

HP Pavilion Media Center TV PC m7570n
Intel Pentium D Processor 915 featuring two processing cores,
Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950, 2048 MB Memory,
320 GB hard drive

I actually did contact HP about seeing if I could purchase a card from
them that was compatible with my computer and would not invalidate my
warranty but they sent me a card that required a 350 watt power supply
or greater and I am still in the process of waiting for my refund for
this.  I don't have a lot of faith in them at this point and am dropping
the upgrading of this computer card dilema.  

If my card can't support EQ then I can accept that and eat a month's
subscription to them to find out.  All I want to know now is if this
d3dx9_30.dll  has the potential to harm my computer with the stats I
have shown you.

Thank you for any info you can offer.  EQ people have always been good
to me (well, except for that one druid you thought he owned all the
ulthorks in the Eastern Wastes and told me to "Get Out !" but that is
another story for another time.  lol :))
