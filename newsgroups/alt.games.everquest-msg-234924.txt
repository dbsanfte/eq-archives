I too am on Stromm now.  Very enjoyable!  After two years on an older server
and leveling a tank to 63 I took an extended break from the game.  Now,
after a week and a half on Stromm I am really enjoying the game.  Just that
sometimes the inexperience of many of the players is painful to take.  I
helped a guildmate recover his corpse from The Warrens last night.  Not a
very easy task for a 17th level Shaman.  We had a level 31 rogue with us but
still.  If the rogue got swamped by 9 greens it could end very badly.  What
was totally stupid about the event was the guildie that died was a level 13
Pally.  When I asked him why he was in here he said he wanted to visit
Gunthak.  When asked why the heck he wanted to go there he replied that the
rogue was going ot kill a dwarf that drops a Drum that is No Drop.  I asked
if he was speaking of the Dwarf that sells Lizzard Mounts and he said yes.
I tried to explain to him that it will not work that way.  Then he
complained that he did not have the PP to buy one so he needed him killed.

CRAZY stuff is said in large quantities on Stromm but I am having the best
time ever in this game on that server.
