Yup.  Many of these dead issues came back to life because of current
and future competition, I think.  There's DAoC now, and Lineage is
coming to the US (Lineage is the biggest MMORPG in the world by far,
with about 10 times the subscriber base of EQ, but that is almost all
Asian, so we don't hear much about it).  You just can't get away any
more with telling players that it is necessary to sit on your ass for
15 minutes after a fight, or that an hour of sitting on your ass
waiting for and riding on boats is fun.
