This guy ruined your night.  Yeah, I like playing my main character too.  But
here's what I would have done:  
1. /report
2. /petition
3. make note of his name, class, race and guild.
4. do a /who all guild "xyz"
5. find a guild leader and report him to said guild.
6. leave the zone, life is too short to let one Moron ruin your night.  Play
elsewhere, or play an alt.
7. go to the guilds website later - or immediately, depending on how mad you
are - and E-mail the guild leader with full details.
