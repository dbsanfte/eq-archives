Wizard
52 - Mana Skin - Regen 1 mana per tick

When my wizard heads into anything which is likely to involve long single
fights, or lots of short fights, it's,

mana skin
KEI
lesser familiar
Spiritual Purity (have to get this before mana skin - won't stick with mana
skin up, but can cast mana skin after you have this)
Flowing Thought I ear ring
Horse

That keeps me going.

And even then, I may only get one or two Tears of Druzzil onto the mob.

I'm always happy to group regardless of what buffs I have, and with luck
there's a chanter in the group with clarity or better.  Without any head
buffs though, unless there's a reasonable pause between mobs, I'll be
dropping one nuke per mob at best.

The problem in some instances is self caused - because I can dump so much
damage onto a mob, they die quickly, which means the next one turns up
quickly, and eventually, even doing one or two nukes per mob, I run out of
mana (I consider 10-15% to be out of mana enough to med, I keep the rest
for emergency parking and evac).

Not a complaint - I will play my wizard without any head buffs and love it,
but the group will have to appreciate that I can't nuke everything - their
perception is the key - but just a reminder that wizard spells tend to be
high in mana cost and that those buffs become essential in quick pulling
groups.  Just as Druid/Cleric/Shaman/Beastlord buffs are essential to the
melee characters to keep them moving about.

At low levels - KEI is just terribly terribly funny to have, but I can say
that having spent time levelling characters without any high level buffs or
any powerlevelling.
