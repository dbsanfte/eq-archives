i dont want to say i believe or don't, but i would like to propound an
alternative:

how about, instead of he hacked eq and can deathtouch anything and solo the
hardest things in the game.....he just happens to be a regular hacker who
learned a little inside information, and used it to build a story with some
would-be-convincing details?

we'll see if the loots are 280/280 soon anyhow (and assuming they are,
wouldn't it be more likely he just found a way to read some of the server's
files, rather than actually hack hack hack like on tv? =P )
