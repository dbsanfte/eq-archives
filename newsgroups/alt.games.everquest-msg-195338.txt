Get fletching kit - its relatively cheap for the first 60 points or so and
will get ou a supply of decent arrows that you can make (range range and
more range) as well as upgrading that bow.

Get an orc fang earring - they are dirt cheap now and give stats and ac,
if you are lucky you might find a good deal on a cougar claw earring,
better than the orc fang in all departments plus its a focus item that
stops mana expenditure on low level spells - mine still fires of on snare,
root and flame lick at lvl 44...I guess I see orc fangs for 30pp in my
server, cougar around 100, but occasionally you see a glut and people sell
for 50pp

Jagged band - popular and handy ring for ac and stats.....go find. Should 
be about 50pp.

Splitpaw hide stuff sells dirt cheap these days, so much so that in many
cases its now considered vendor trash and I found out its cheaper to buy
it fro a vendor than in the bazaar a lot of the time so look at vendors
near splitpaw (that'd be SK vendors, the guy in the tower at the NK zone
to SK that sort of thing) - get lucky and you'll see splitpaw there for a
few plat. Its decent ac with resists and stats.

At your level look for AC, AC and more AC really. Your spells will get
ever better and allow you to be self buffed reasonably. Most newbie stuff
seems to be about equivalent to banded with stats, so you really need to
step above that level. Look for items in slots you dont have filled with
newbie armour. Where you dont have newbie armour, and dont intend to get
it - fill those slots. Go to the bazaar, get the fancy items and then go
do a search or ranger items with ac costing up to 50pp in the /bazaar
window.

Look at the items and then work ot the best ac gain to cash expenditure
and buy them. Look at acrylia studded and reinforced items...if you server
is anythin like Antonious Bayle there is SO much of that stuff made by
smiths skilling up its dumped onto the market as dirt cheap prices. that
would fill in gaps.

Get a cheap second magic weapon, velium weapons are a standard at about
10pp each, though there may well be more cheapies from LoY hitting the
market. Possibly get one that isnt 1hs to up your skills with.
