Um, no, I solo all the time at level 65, many others do as well.  I have 
soloed at just about all levels, in zones from all the expansions, 
including LDoN, after completing adventures.  I have noticed no change in 
the difficulty of soloing, in fact, it's getting easier as I accumulate AAs 
and gear.
