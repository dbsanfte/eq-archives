Actually, it's not as bad as you think . . .

the tailor can be the brewer (my tailor can brew well enough to make the
headies) - they only take a moment and about 2 gold total - - the vial of
mana isn't really that big a deal either, because its just a spell the
chanty casts ( i'm pretty sure) --> either way, the cost of both is covered
in the first pp you lay down. AAALLLLLL the rest of the money you spend goes
toward the time necessary to kill spideys ( which isn't too bad either,
considering a smart tailor ::points at self::: will shout bribes into a
newbie zone and buy noobs over )

so in answer, i NEVER paid more than 20pp, and i would never sell for more
than 30pp

i only haggle like this because i gave up reciting poetry for donations
 its NOT begging if i'm an ascetic role-playing a bard) LOL
