Yeah they definetly are, in the summer.  But the winter sucks and there's 
nothing else to do really.  If you take a girl out all you do is waste money 
so stayin home and hackin into your new game can't be that bad.  You're 
saving some money at least.   And sometimes, video games actually KEEP 
people from doing drugs
