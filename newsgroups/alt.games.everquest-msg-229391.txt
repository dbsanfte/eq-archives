Mhh.. I guess I've been barely making the ass-cutoff as (pun intended)
I donate 20pp for KEI normally. In my younger levels, I only donated
15pp, because that was really all I could afford without making a loss
(hunting in DL..). I guess I could pay more by now - I'll change to
25pp for now, and maybe more later on once I finally have my Drogmor.

Another reason by the way is, that when I log on, I need (as in "am
ineffective without") 3 casts:
-Focus Bag (25pp)
-Kei (20pp)
-Pot9 (15pp)
So before doing any hunting I'm out 60pp, which is still a significant
amount of money for me since I'm having a real hard time finding
groups these days - and a soloing wizard doesn't make much cash.

By the way, I keep getting very low donations on porting people. My
porting announce makes it clear that it's for donation (ie, don't pay
if you don't want to - I still believe that's what "for donation"
means) and quite frequently I get nothing. Of course it still kind of
pisses me off if I seriously go out of my way to lend a helping hand
and then get a "thx. c ya l8ter", but I like the "for donation"
approach better than, say, announcing how much you want.

Example (that I've been meaning to get off my chest): a level 56
beastlord who needed a port to PoK in the Rathe Mountains. After I
cast the TL on him, he hands me 5pp and tells me that's all he has.
After I know he's been in the zone for quite a while (because I keep
checking it to make sure it's not getting over-crowded - and anyway
I'd ran across him a few times)... THAT is insulting. I'd rather get
nothing.

Of course, these feelings are in character. In RL, I don't really care
at all. Right.
