I disagree. That is the -worst- way to trickle down raid loot. People 
who can't/don't raid should not have their upgrade path be defined as 
'junk you no longer wear'.

There is nothing fun, adventurous, heroic, or satisfying about killing 
the mighty spiderlings, rathe giants, and what not to buy your hand-me-
down garbage. 

There is no way that should be the only way for a non-raider to upgrade 
their gear.
