I am honestly confused by the amount of negitive reaction that my post has 
got in the frist 3 responces. 

I will say once again that this was a bit of a joke, but I really don't see 
that it would be bad for the game or the player in gerneral and would be a 
real boon to some people.

In responce to Biz "That'd be fun, huh?" comment, well I spend a lot of 
time in the bazzar at the moment, both selling and looking for items. While 
the bazzar tool is good it is not that good, and if there was an easier way 
for me to search and buy and sell, then yes it would make that aspect of 
the game more fun for me. 

This could be done in game or out of game IMO. Since in game what I 
generally do is sit in trader mode looking at the ground and using the 
(slightly clumsy) bazzar tool, then occasionally having a laggy wander to 
find a (invariably half hidden) character on the other side of the zone. 

At this point I get to interact ! I click on them and buy something ! Then 
I sit back down put trader back on and start browsing again. 

Other than the laggy graphics and the walk across zone what would the 
difference be between this and a web page or standalone tool ? (if it was 
going to be a serious suggestion then I would require that people log out 
in the bazzar to use it)

There are some serious suggestions on how they could improve the bazzar :

As others have said turn off pets familiers spell casting songs etc. in the 
bazzar to reduce lag.

Improve the /bazzar tool so that you can do things like :
Have more refined queries, like only list items that give XXX more than 
yyy. (This would be very useful for weapons)

Have the ability to save queries (like you can with spell set-ups), I think 
that half my time is sepnt toggling the drop downs to switch from looking 
for xxxx to looking for yyyy

Add more options into the type box (tradeskills bing the most obvious)

One thing I would love to see would be a WTB feature. Have it so you can 
set yourself up wanting to buy this many of this item at this price. The 
system can check that you have the money and slots available. Then people 
could give you the item to receive the cash.

I can understand the desire for the game to be immersive, but the bazzar 
just isn't and if you made it immersive in any real way it would become 
such a pain to use that people just wouldn't.
