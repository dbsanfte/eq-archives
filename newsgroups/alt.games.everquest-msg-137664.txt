<snip n stuff>

things i used to pay for a port today:

1) nothing.  had nothing in the bank.  needed to make a corpse run.
shouted i was giving free breezes in the nexus, and would like a SoW
from a kind soul.  a very nice wizard came up, handed me a 10 dose SoW
potion, told me to take a drink, i handed it back, and she TL'd me to
gfay.  i couldn't even breeze her.  made my day.  went out and buffed
newbies near my corpse for a while.
2) sold pretty much everything extra i had and scrapped together 20pp
for a port to feerrott.  then realized i forgot to go to freeport to
pick up the bartender's compendium.  oops.  gate back to the nexus and
take the spires to NK after nobody would port me.
3) went afk for a few in WC.  came back and i was in shadowhaven.  got
killed by a damned skeleton.  shouted for a port to WC for a CR.  a very
nice druid offered to take me for free, so when i got there i offered to
give him the HQ bear pelt i had on my corpse.  he accepted ;)
4) ran to freeport and back to WC to meet with a guildie.  NOW i needed
the port to feerrott.  offered a druid 4pp, a breeze, and 14 white
wines.  he took the breeze and the 4pp.  hooray!  i could still get
drunk!

my enchanter now has a stein of moggok to put his 14 white wines in, and
less than 2gp to his name.  looks like he'll be taking the spires for a
while :/
