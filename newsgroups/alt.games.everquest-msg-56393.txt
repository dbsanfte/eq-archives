(sorry if this rant goes everywhere)

is it just me or do druid have the hardest time getting armor and other
equipment.  The halloween event just proved it more....granted i didn't go
to Rathe Mountains but warriors and paladins made out great but druids got a
belt which is so-so at best and a slightly decent headpeice..where is the
balance?  Warriors got items i would kill for, paladins got very good items.

I have to scrap up every copper peice and save and save just to get a decent
druid item...i can't find crap for less than 1k pp except for forest loops.
I prasied the gods when some guy was getting rid of his druid can gave me a
tree weave (ac 25 str +10) for 500pp.  everything else i own i had to camp
places for weeks to get (testaments of vanear, forest loops, dwarven work
boots, cloack of the ice bear).  I find stuff for my friends who
consequently don't have druids all the time, but druid stuff is i think the
hardest thing to find.If anyone has a answer for my problems or
agrees/disagrees let me know.
