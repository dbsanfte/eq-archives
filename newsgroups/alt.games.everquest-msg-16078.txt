Killing treants <tut> So paladin was the right choice for you then, all
goodly deeds and all ;�)
The treants give bad faction, I believe, with the Jagged Pine protectorate,
who the named ones are part of , again, I believe.
I doubt it was the beer scenario as was suggested, it's the normal druids
that get involved in those conflicts and the named ones do not, at least not
until one of the Druids casts an AoE spell that hits the NPC and he starts
beating on, the druid that cast it...odd but amusing to watch.

I agree with all the other suggestions of killing Gnolls in BB and Unkempt
druids, get your faction back, you're meant to be a good guy, sheesh my SK
has better faction than you, by the sound of it :�)
