You're reckoning without ranger spell damage and weapons, which are also, I 
would say, as it should be. Theres a reason we dont get plate, and it isnt
that enduring breath is such a useful spell ;)

Lots and Lots of ranger spells directly affect combat damage - ATK buffs,
DoTs, DD's, Damage shields more easily obtainable haste, and so forth.

Melee output looks like this, I think:

Rogue, Monk, Ranger, Warrior, SK, Paladin

(Where does Bard sit?)

Rogue and Monk are far further ahead of the pack than the difference
between the other classes though. Markedly so.

And tank ability looks something like this:

Warrior, Paladin, SK, Rogue, Ranger, Monk

I'm not convinced of this. Pretty much throughout my career I've had better
weapons than warriors my level; its juuuuuust beginning to even out in the
high end game (level 60) and I suspect the warriors will once again start
pulling away, but thats a pretty small proportion of the "level range",
even if it ends up being a large portion of most peoples playtime. (Which
I would say is debatable anyway).

Also, an interesting thing of course, is that while ranger weapons seem 
inexplicably sucky in Luclin compared to the other meleeists we now have
flowing thought items appearing that are hybrid only in some cases, which
may once again provide an interesting way to close the gap, with more
emphasis on the hybrids "unique" abilities.

Only having fire based DD's of any worth sucks rocks though ;-)

And they're always so comically colourful too ;)
