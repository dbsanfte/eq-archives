If you are concerned by the lack of other players, you should consider
starting a character in either Freeport or Kelethin (greater Faydark). These
area's are always very busy. The easiest character to play, as I've been
told, is a druid. If you start in Kelethin you can become a woodelf druid
and get foraging an night vision from the get go. Also a good point when you
want to develop a trade skill as the Greater Faydark en the East
Commons(just outside Freeport) always have a brisk trade going on. If you
want to make sure you never ever ever run into anyone at anytime start in
Erudin :) I just started my first Wizard there and the place is deserted
(anyone need a silver  malachite ring?)
