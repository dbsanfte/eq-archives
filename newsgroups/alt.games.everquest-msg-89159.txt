Troy, have you ever realized that people (or companies) do not go out of
their way to screw you?

You went LD, maybe SoE's fault  or could be (GASP!) your ISP's fault.

How did you go LD? And how do you think SOE "owes" you something?

It is all a vast conspriacy involving The FreeMasons, Illuminati, & Sony to
screw over Troy Kraus. Weren't you at the meeting?

Right! Its a policy! you would be amazed at the amount of whiners who demand
that mobs should pop on their schedule....oh wait...

And then, without the whining, your mob appears. Do you realize how foolish
the rest sounds, now?

Right. So stop blaming your Evercrack dealer!
