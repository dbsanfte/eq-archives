I seem to have run into something that I am certain others here have faced
and I was looking for a little advice.

I have created several characters. Among them I have a Lvl 14 Mage, a Lvl 13
Druid, a Lvl 13 Bard, a Lvl 12 Necro and just started a Rogue (Lvl 6 at the
moment). My problem is this, I know that as soon as I get the Rogue to Lvl
12 or so, I will get bored again. Every time I get one of my characters to
Lvl 12-14, I get bored with them and move on to create a new one (Repeating
the process every time).

I am finding it difficult to find groups (I am on the Thoelux Paells Server)
Mainly because I play at odd times (Between 2am and 7am Central time). The
only character I was able to find a group for was my Bard, but found it
annoying since So many people have difficulty understanding how a Bard works
(like asking me to cast Selo on them so they can run back to town real
quick). Even if I explain how my character (at the time) works or even
adapting to their play style, Finding a good group is near impossible.

So my question is this, What can I do to help me keep my interest in a
character and keep them going through the ranks. Hitting Lvl 14 for my Druid
would be nice but the monotony of Soloing and medding just keeps me from
playing. My mage is a pansy. Sure, the pet is great but the pet is a lvl 12
pet and I need to take something of equal lvl to me to get decent exp so my
pet gets slaughtered, which means, so do I Plus I run into the medding thing
again. The Bard is my favorite, and should I ever run across a group that
understands how they work and that they are, more often then not, number one
on a MOBs hate list, then I would love to play him more.

What can I do. I would love to have a high lvl character but I hit this
bottleneck and just start a new character. How do you (Especially those of
you with High lvl characters) get past the boredom that seems to hit around
these lvls? Should I start a particular character that does not really
suffer from this bottle neck or is it juts a matter of my having a short
attention span?

I really could use some advice, especially since I will run out of slots to
create a new character on the server that I use ( I would really hate to
have 50 lvl 12 character spread out over seven different servers.


Thank you in advance for your advice and comments.
