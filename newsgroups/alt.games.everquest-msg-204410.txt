Imagine how annoying it is for us that don't have a second account or
trader mules... I trade with my main when he's not in use and it will
be annoying to finish a hunt and trek to the bazaar to see it full. 
As it is, the zone is lagged to hell.  I'd like to see a level
requirement for traders.  No more level one mules named
