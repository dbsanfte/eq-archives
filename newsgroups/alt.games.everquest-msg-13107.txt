I've been reading up on this Conquest banning (and also looked at a
screenshot showing the sleeper AND the giant human) and it seems to me
Verant couldn't handle the fact that the players had managed to
outthink them and make any headway at all in ST before they were
'supposed to'. 
They put a challenge like the Sleeper in the game and then ban people
for trying to meet the challenge, with or without tricks? *rolls eyes*
I won't blame Conquest for trying dirty tricks to get anywhere against
the wardens - and they never even got near killing it. And what's the
deal with triggering the incomplete script to get the guild out of the
zone? Makes as much sense as porting people to Veeshan's Peak and
binding them there...
A reaction to their methods might have been in order, but an
overreaction like this, with triggering the bugged script, banning
players and disbanding the guild? No.
