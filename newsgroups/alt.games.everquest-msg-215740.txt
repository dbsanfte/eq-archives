Ok, looking in a bit more detail, I did get some interesting things.

First, same dungeon, same quest (named we had to kill was identical and
everything), but two different groups.

First time through, we had 6 65's, mobs came out to be around 12k in hp, and
we're hitting for 340+. Named had approx about 100k of hp, and hit for well
over 600.

However, second time we went through, we had 1 63 2 64's, and 3 65's. Same
mobs, same quest, mobs had 11k of hp, and were hitting for about 300+. Named
here had approx 90k of hp, and hitting consistently for 490.

While the dungeons may use higher mobs, and a higher quest standard, I think
those are just templates. The actual damage and hp of the mobs seems to be
directly affected by the average level.
