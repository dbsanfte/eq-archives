If you get out there alone and unsow'd, even at level fifty, there can
be a grocery store checkout line of greens waiting which, if you stand
there and just try to fight through the adds, will take a melee type
down pretty effetively. I wouldn't classify it as a "deathtrap" per se,
but the designers did seem to code an awfully large swath of the local
wanderers to path right through there.
  Of course, once I got j-boots it wasn't nearly as bad anymore, as I
could make the bridge easy.
