The only thing I kite is Gore, Sev, Talendor and a dragon in WW
(Myga?). The chanters deal with the adds or we split tank if
unmezzable.

On a raid, never. Rooting a mob is a good way to get TLed out.

Damage shields are handled by magicians not druids.

Agreed, for the lesser mobs. Against Vindi you might as well use the
bind wound skill. I've had to heal rampage victims on several Vindi
kills. Non-tanks are dead instantly, and the tanks who can take the
abuse have 4-5k hps. Chloroblast just doesn't cut it. Even Nature's
Touch is woefully underpowered at 880 points a cast.

>5. Regen

Agreed. Druids handle the regen since shamans are busy buffing,
slowing, etc.

>6. DoT

Almost never. Dots suck if you have to switch mobs.

>7. DD

I seldom nuke unless there's a cleric in my group. I helped out our
server's resident uber guild on a Tormax kill and did 12k dmg or so.
All nukes landed for full.  Against a properly debuffed mob, both
wildfire and moonfire usually land for full damage.

>8. Succor on bad pulls (with the addition of lessor Succor ALL raid
>capable druids can inter-zone evac not just level 57+)

Succor is almost never used on a raid. If you wipe the cleric that
camped out pops back in and rezzes you. If not it's a coffin CR.

I agree that healing needs to be improved. Most of the other requests
just made me laugh. The people at eqdruids had good intentions but
don't quite understand game balance or scope.
