  Because languages are absolutely useless from a gameplay point of view on
most servers (except for a very few quests, ect. which may involve scrolls
and books written in other languages, which may help if you aren't going to
use a spoiler site to get info on the quest).

  Somewhere on the web site there's a "Fippy's Facts" chart that shows which
languages are the most popular.  Kind of interesting.  On my old main
server, I was Master in a few different languages... Iksar, Teir'Dal, Dark
Speech, Elder Elvish, Elder Dragon, and Halfling I think (in addition to
Elvish and Common, which I knew by default as a wood elf).  On Morell-Thule
I had my human worshipper of Innoruuk learn Teir'Dal for roleplay purposes.
With my new character on Firiona Vie, I so far have not been able to get a
single language skill increment in all of my travels, and I'm fuzzy on just
how exactly language learning is limited on that server.  So far my
character on that server only knows erudite and human, the two languages
that all erudites have mastered by default.
