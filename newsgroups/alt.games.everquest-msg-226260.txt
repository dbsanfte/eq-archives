Actually I think i've been mistaken about the whole thing. I thought I
had been accepted into the EQ2 beta, but it's actually "Lords of
Everquest" ... they're not the same thing are they ? I did apply to be
in the EQ2 beta, have no idea what this "lords of everquest" is or why
I got a beta acceptance email for it.

Cheers,
