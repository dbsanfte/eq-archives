Both of you need room to operate and that village is not the greatest
place for that.  If you are trying to get an ear ring get a differnt
group or wait until you and the necro can fight with out the kite.

The two of you would get better exp in  Karanas and you would have
more room for any type of kiting.

If you really want to get exp fast and safe pick up a rouge for your
group and reverse kite.  That combo can level up to 50 on outside
zones faster than anything you could imagine.
