Been there done that got the damn T-Shirt. I was still a hopeless newb when
Viarra was 50. From 50-55 I learned a LOT hving joined a good guild, and
played a number of other classes up to significant levels.  Although Im sure
that some would consider me a newb still ( farthest Ive gotten in the game
is raiding HoT ), at least I now have a good understanding of the game
mechanics :)
