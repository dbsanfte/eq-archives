If you're just playing on your own or with a group of friends then it
matters not a lick.  If you're looking to join, or currently in, a
guild then it's a matter of keeping up at least enough to be useful
and contribute the guild goals.

I spent about 200p on my beserker in bazaar gear, total, and he kicks
butt.  Of course even as little as 3 years ago 200p was a tidy sum,
but today it's chump change.  Even I, a casual player who only plays
one night a week for a few hours, has about 8k in the bank. 

last night in Echo Caverns I actually got 2 upgrades from mob drops.
That was cool.

Not sure exactly where I'm going with this other than, whatever.  It's
a game and I play as I like, or don't.  To me EQ is the greatest
computer game ever created, but I'm simple too.
