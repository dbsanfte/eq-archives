Not really a reply to you, Lokari, as much as it is to the group in
general. Didn't a couple people get on my case a little while back for
flaming GetsumJ right off the bat, claiming that he was attempting to
become a productive member of this group? I, for one, have yet to see
any of that productivity apparent in this thread. What I HAVE seen,
though, is a futile and juvenile attempt at trolling, albeit a poor one.
Just thought I would point that out.
