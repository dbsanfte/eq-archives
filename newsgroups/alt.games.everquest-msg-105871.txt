Even that wouldn't work, because it won't be listening on any ports.  It
puts your NIC into promiscuous mode, so it sees all the traffic on the
network.

It is possible to detect that a NIC on the LAN is in promiscuous mode, but
they can't tell that it is because of ShowEQ.  There are numerous
diagnostics and monitoring tools one might be running for legitimate non-EQ
purposes that would put a NIC into promiscuous mode.

As more and more people get broadband, and run their LANs behind stand-alone
routers, even detecting the promiscuous NIC will get harder for Verant.
Most common home routers function as switches, not hubs, which means that
the traffic from the EQ is not visible to the Linux computer, making it hard
to use ShowEQ.  The usual workaround for that is to get a cheap hub, and
plug your EQ and Linux computer into the hub, and plug the hub into your
router.

However, there is another way to connect things.  Instead of connecting your
cable or DSL modem to the router directly, connect the modem to a hub, and
connect the router to a hub.  Your computers connect to the router.  Now,
when you want to run ShowEQ, just plug the Linux computer into the hub.  It
now sees all the EQ traffic, but it is on the outside of the firewall, and
so probing for promiscuous NICs won't see it.

Those aren't the dumbest ones.  There have been people who have /petitioned
after a patch broke ShowEQ for help getting it working again!
