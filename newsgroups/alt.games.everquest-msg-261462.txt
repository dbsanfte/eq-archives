Well, OK, I'm getting the message. But most of my AAs have been done solo 
(as have most of my levels). Up until 3 months ago I was leader of a "small 
family-type guild" which had a dozen people plus alts, about half of which 
were 65. I got flagged up to the point where I needed Agnarr, RZ and Saryn 
for EP by doing pickup raids.

I recently transferred servers (to the UbiSoft UK server because I just ran 
out of things to do in my play times and got fed up with raiding to 3am with 
the core US players on the server) and joined a guild who were about to do 
Saryn/TZ/VZ/RZ/MM/Agnarr/Bert for the first time. I couldn't join the UK 
timezone guild on my original server because I lacked flags, AAs, and 
commitment to their raid schedule .... when I looked for new guilds I didn't 
reach the entry criteria for most of them. So YOU may think I'm "uber", but 
I for sure don't.

And to put back some of the snipped context, I've had just one char that 
I've played for over 4 years, so it's been a gradual progression for me.
