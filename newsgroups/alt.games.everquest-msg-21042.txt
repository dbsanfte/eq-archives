    Tons of tradeskill supplies - one lava rock can usually get me 100 plat
in return, for example. Jacinths and Black Sapphires, when they had value on
my server greater than the 180 plat they cost. Magic items by the bushel -
Runic Carver for 6 pp, Loam Collar for cheap, various post-55 spells. And in
terms of XP, I've found bushels of Bone Chips, Aviak Chick Talons, and Aviak
Talons on merchants in the Butcherblock area.
