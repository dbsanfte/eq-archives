There is no way I am going to cast my complete heal any sooner. It costs a 
lot of mana and is useless if you use it as a minor heal. My hot key clearly 
posted that the spell was incoming, yet everytime this "back up" healer 
stepped in and tromped all over me.

When the Ldon began, rolls were assigned. I was "healer and looter." No 
back-up healer was assigned, because no back up healer was needed. Not to 
brag, but I do a pretty good job as a cleric. When people do not trust me, 
it is a bit insultijng. Granted, when they grp with me the first time and do 
not know me... it may take a bit for them to see I am responsible. But to 
step in and heal unasked... is not treating the cleric respectfully, imo.

If I get low on mana and need help, I am the first to say lom or oom and ask 
for an assist. But this was right from the beginning when mana pools were 
high... and went all the way through the Ldon even when I tried to politely 
explain I am the healer and I am full of mana and at the momet, was doing ok 
w/o help.

The druid got a bit defensive and said "Don't jump on me! I'm just trying to 
help you out! I AM fighting, too, ya know." Which in reality, he was NOT 
doing much fighting and he kept asking for breaks to med. I'd say "Go ahead 
and med up, I am good. We are behind on time so we need to keep moving."

He'd then complain he just needed a minute. He wanted us to wait.

We lost the Ldon... ran out of time. Why? For waiting on the druid to med so 
he could keep stepping in and doing my job!

Too many people are afraid to rock the boat and say what they think. If you 
say anything, you come off as being a ass. I always try to say things in a 
polite way and still they take offence... and then the whole group suffers 
for their idiocy. My husband and I have a list and just won't grp with 
people like this anymore...
