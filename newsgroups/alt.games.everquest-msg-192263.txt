As with any weapon that has a "recommended" level, if you are below
that level the stat bonuses will be worse and the damage amount will
be limited a bit.

I have never equiped a sword or bow that was more than maybe 5 levels
above my character level.  So I don't know exactly how much your stats
will suffer.  But they never seem to be so bad that the equipment is
useless.

Do you have the Luclin expansion?  This all becomes so much easier if
you can just go to the bazaar, search for Bows equipable by rangers,
organize by price, and see what you can get for the money that you
want to spend.
