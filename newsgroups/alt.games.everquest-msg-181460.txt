Yes, Sir you are correct, I DID NOT post such a message... The cyber
stalker is a nurse Filipino man named Daryl Pahimna. He has been
reported to the FBI for his criminal activities.


Daryl Pahimna alias Brother Brahman-Atmananda 
Box No. 207 Cabanatuan City 3100
Cabanatuan City, Philippines - 
Phone Number: 600 1253


Although, He claims to be living now in Central London, Great Britain


Thank you  Brian,


No, I did not post such message, the impostor is a Filipino man. 
I am a family man happily married. All these allegations are false


Please see below:


Brother Brahman-Atmananda 's slander cannot be tolerated any longer
for the sake of the spiritual boards. It is unfortunate that some in
this world have nothing better to do than to attempt to cause hurt to
others


It has been brought to my attention that Mr. Noel Daryl L. Pahimna
aka. Brother Brahman-Atmananda posted a message accusing me of
impersonating him under the pseudonym of Sri Brother
Brahman-Atmananda.. Mr. Pahimna as many of you know as B-A uses
different aliases and self-created characters such as Ojasvini, Da
Acharya Premabrahmananda Swami, Cranium, Jessai
http://profiles.yahoo.com/jessai, Red_Purusha, KatLover ,Lorraine,
Maritza and dozens more.
For those not familiar with the Filipino "Brother Brahman-Atmananda"
check the following link at:

Address: Science Of Religion, Inc.
Box No. 207 Cabanatuan City 3100
Cabanatuan City, Philippines - 
Phone Number: 600 1253


The impostor submitted a message that appeared yesterday under my name
(Rigo Muniz), I did not post such message, it will be foolish for me
to incriminate myself or apologize for something I have not done, it
is obvious who the impostor is for those familiar with his "modus of
operandi" of anti-spiritual warfare and guerrilla tactics to cause
psychological intimidation and confusion.
Just for the record, I do not read or post messages in these
newsgroups at all. I consider these newsgroups very detrimental for
spiritual growth.


Background History
In 1998 Mr. Pahimna was engaged in acts of cyber-terrorism all over
the Internet.


I am a founder known as Kardec of the Yoga Message board, at that
time I was asked to moderate the Discussion Kriya Board owned by Mr.
Hendrik and Mr. Waller invited me to moderate The Universal
Inspirational Message Board as well. These message boards were owned
by the defunct beseen.com. It was a great privilege for me to be able
to serving - two very nice souls when I hardly knew them at all- it
was truly a great honor for me. At the time, I was not aware of a
dispute going on among the Filipino man "guru wanna be" 
Brahman-Atmananda and someone named Keith 007.
Then all of a sudden, I began to get daily threatening and obscene
e-mail messages from Brahman-Atmananda, I believe because of my
silence his frustration grew day by day began to exhibiti childish
behavior that sometimes I would described them as tantrums of anxiety
exerted by someone who is very mentally disturbed. Then
Brahman-Atmananda began desecrecating the great yogis and decided to
attack and fill the spiritual boards with daily pornographic material
in order to turn people away. I believe he did so because he realized
I was an obstacle to his career as cyber- terrorist. I was able to
track him down so well and uncover his dirty tracks. Then. He realized
that I was his biggest nightmare so he augmented his personal attacks
by impersonating me as kardec and such, he even stole a picture of my
personal web site and e-mailed it to many friends accusing me of evil
activities with the goal of silencing me. He even encouraged me to
commit suicide.


In the same year B-A was having heated arguments with radio Host Show
Art Bell (Art Bell is a radio personality that was victim of an
Internet Hoax) which it led me to believe that B-A was the author of
the Filipino Hate letter. Unfortunately, the site was shut down and
the FBI was conducting an investigation in reference to this famous
case that resonated all over the world. Please see this link at:
http://www.psicounsel.com/forged.html


Later on Mr. Pahimna began to use anonymous services such as
anonimyzer. to hide his identity or ip address through different
proxies. He established a good rapport with an Italian individual
known as Furio ( http://www.angelfire.com/yt/KRIYAYOGA/index.html ) in
thus manner B-A was able to maintain a presence in the Internet by
using Furio's website at http://www.angelfire.com/yt/kr/satguru.html,
despite of the fact that B-A was expelled from Geocities for
violations of the rules.


Dissemination of false allegations perpetrated against me or any
other individual constitutes a defamation of character and
infringement of human rights.
I' am taking these allegations very seriously. I vehemently advocate
the promotion and respect of human rights all over the world, for the
right to privacy and against impunity for human rights violators.


If deemed necessary, I will prosecute this case under International
Law.
If Noel Daryl L. Pahimna lives in Central London, Great Britain as he
claimed to be. I would appreciate anyone with any information
concerning his whereabouts and physical address. Please e-mail me at
muniz1@earthlink.net
These boards need to be moderated for that reason.


Sincerely,


R. Muniz

Dear Mr. Muniz:
Someone, while using an anonymizer, is posting as you, with your name,
address, phone number and earthlink email addy, some troll-ish and
rather uncouth crap.
It's on the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology and you are shown as
the poster. But headers can be forged and I do not believe you are
writing this stuff.
But I wanted to give you a heads up on this.

Hey Muniz,


I thought you should know, that this was posted on some newsgroups
(see
which below). I'm pretty sure, you did not post that yourself, since
the
source was anonymous. So just look out..
