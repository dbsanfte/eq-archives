They are still useless . I still dont play my 60 druid ever . What I did
instead was spend 22 hrs powerleveling a cleric to 49. The cleric is now 51
with 2 aa(run of course) just from being grouped occasionally and serving
his job of casting cheal on my monk once every 5 mins.

The sad fact is that while better healing is absolutely necessary to make
druids even semi viable, nothing less than cheal will close the gap enough.
The gap will continue to widen every expansion past the already ridiculous
state of affairs now.

druid 400 mana 880 heal
shaman 200 mana 1200 torpor
cleric 400 mana 7000 heal

If you cant beat them join them, and this is the major problem. Druids are
dying in droves and there is a cleric on every street corner.
