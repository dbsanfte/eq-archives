Hmm, I can't say that it's a bonanza for just monks and bards, lots there
I'll look forward to too.

Hmf, sounds like one of the less interesting skills to me...

Well... When you're on a dragon raid and see a ton of players running
off on the first DragonRoar, it sounds useful. But mostly, yeah, pretty
limited use.

Heh, as long as no mobs inside the warrior's radius isn't mezzed... Eeek!

Probably.

This one is probably for rogues? Improved Evade, finally?

I donut know what this spell is, necro spell? Whatsit do?

VERY probably for SKs, yes. It's probably just a different horse graphic
(maybe with a higher speed than the default horse?) that looks more evil
or something.

Nope, pretty sure that it'll be a perm effect.

I think it'll probably be a Paladin skill, so yes, it'll be an Ultimate
Sacrifice sort of thing. Picture this: Your group is in trouble, you've
used LoH, the MA is being beat on, the cleric is OOM. If the pally uses
this skill, the party might live, if not, TPW. What do you do?

I think it'll be limited to just one class. (paladins, from where it was
placed in the list, IIRC)

Think it'll be the main crossroads of Luclin, with cities and the Bazaar
in adjacent zones.

Naw, level 49 charm isn't THAT powerful, is it? It's not like it's
Dictate, and even that has been nerfed down in power...

And finally we get it! Yay!

Same as the last comment =D

Verrrry interesting... But will it be enough to rekindle interest for bored
level 60s?
