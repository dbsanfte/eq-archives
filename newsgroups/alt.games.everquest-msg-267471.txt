This is messier than it looks.  For starters, I don't know how last
names work in EQ2, but I really appreciated when they made it easier
to change your last name in EQL.  (It meant I could stop trying to
come up with the "perfect" last name for my main, and just pick
something and try it for a while to see if I liked it.)  If the last
name is part of what disambiguates first names, being able to change
last names is more of a problem.

And what about people who thought they had the one and only Poobah,
and indeed there are folks who have Poobah on their friends lists or
built into hotkeys or whatever, and suddenly another Poobah shows up?

Actually, what bugs me most about picking a name is not that the good
names are all taken, but that I can't figure out what rules the server
uses for rejecting a name.  I've tried some pretty bizarre combinations
and had them rejected, so I figure it must be because the server
requires the name be "readable" or something, not that someone else
already has it.

E.g., when I created a character to try various experiments (e.g.
figuring out the level caps on offense/defense for pure casters), I
tried the name "Experiment", which wasn't allowed (and sure, might 
have been taken), and also "Xperiment", "Xpermint", etc.  Eventually
I was allowed to use "Expermint", but I can't believe all the other
ones I tried were already in use.  (And still in use, too, because
if you delete a character the name becomes available again.)
