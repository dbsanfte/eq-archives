No.  Not only no, but Hell, NO!  Needing something is NOT the same as being
greedy.

Need is when I'm falling behind and I require better weapons / armour to be
a productive member of a group.  Greed is when I put on lower-quality gear
so people will take pity on me and say I need the better stuff that's just
dropped.

Need is when I require a particular item to continue with a quest.  Greed is
when I decide I need 4 of them, just in case.

Greed is when I insist that I need something that someone else in the group
would actually use, then turn around and sell it.

You're saying that a L40 naked warrior is greedy if he wants a weapon and
armour to get back into the game.

Dichotomy.  And I don't think that's the word you were after, here.
