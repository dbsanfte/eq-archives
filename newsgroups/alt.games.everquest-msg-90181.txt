I assumed it was because EQ is designed to be 'Immersive'.

That is to say, if you could bounce around between windows it would be less
like you were in Norrath, and more like you were playing a computer game.

To an extent I agree. If I (as a newbie) could have bounced out of the game
to look up every quest and the strategy for killing every mob in WK I would
have missed aout on a lot of frustrating fun!

Once the EXP penalty becomes constrictive, and CR's achieve epic
proportions, it's nice to compare notes with established EQ sites.

So now I run 2 PC's LOL!
