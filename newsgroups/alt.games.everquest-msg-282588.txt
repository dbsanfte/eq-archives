Then you dispute the notion that they are worse than any other game 
publisher out there? Because see, that was my whole point, not that they 
are worse than the owners/operators of the West Virginia coal mines or 
Nike/Cathy Lee Gifford production plants or Enron or drug dealers or any 
other case of immoral an unethical business practices that naturally go 
without saying.

If you'd like to continue this discussion, let's at least stay focused and 
refrain from twisting my side into something easier for you to snipe.

Name a game publisher that you feel is worse in this regard and cite the 
case where they milked their customers as shamelessly for as long a period 
of time.
