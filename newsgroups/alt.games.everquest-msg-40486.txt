...any particular reason you count Necro and SK Fear as mob
debuffs, while you don't include it for the others?

Can't remember if Paladins get any fears but undead fears,

And then there's the ID classes, and the Panic Animal classes.
Didn't see those included either.

Again, any reason why you won't let Bards wear illusion masks?
