As a shaman you only have two lines of DoTs, unlike a necro.  It is a bit
quicker to toss a Plague on, then reapply your best poison Dot.  In PoN
where I have been soloing most recently, the pup is just totally outclassed,
so I don't bother with him.  I strictly use root and rot there.  Me
attempting to melee mobs there is a very bad idea, I go down even faster
than my pup.  I will try again now that I have the gimp CH, and see if it
works better with pet now.
