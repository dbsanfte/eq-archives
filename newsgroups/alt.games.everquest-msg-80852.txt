Don't forget Gate...

Also, while Minor Illusion looks like nothing but fluff (it
makes you look like the nearest object), it can be very handy
as a "hide" spell.  It makes you Indifferent to most mobs,
so you can sit and meditate without being attacked unexpectedly,
and its duration is more predictable than the Invis spell.
Plus it can be refreshed without breaking from "hiding",
unlike the invis spell.  You can even use it to shop from
Dubious vendors, or fight without getting ads (yes, you can 
fight and spellcast while Minor Illusion is up and not 
lose the illusion).

Mez, Tashan, and Fear should be must-buys as well.
