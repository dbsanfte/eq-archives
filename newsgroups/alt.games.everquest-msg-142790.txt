    Not terribly near the entrance, no. From the zone-in, you'll take the
left drop-down, go through the Frenzied room, past a static spider, and drop
down into an open area with a few wanderers around. There's two tunnels out
of there. One leads to the zone-out. The other leads to some twisty tunnels.
Through these tunnels, if you go one way you go to the Strathbone Runelord's
room. If you take the other branch, you come to an area called "five towers"
because it's a relatively open area with five ruined towers in it. Lots of
spawns here, the going can be slow if you're fighting through. Past five
towers is the chapel area with Xalgoz. In addition to his normal drop table
(which includes the Fang) he always drops a Fang. If you're careful you
could avoid aggroing some of the mobs around you, but best bet is to at
least clear the tower across from the entry to the Chapel.

    An XP group that was well-balanced would make so much XP setting up in
this area it boggles the mind. You'd never run out of pulls, and the XP
modifier in the zone is quite nice. You'd also all come out with a
Tombcarver and a weight reducing pack. ;-)
