It was also bad because I've heard players complain that they had
trouble getting into some groups because the groups would insist that
the player have KEI/virtue or whatever before they would be accepted
into the group, and some players just didn't have the cash to keep
running to PoK to get KEI/virtue/etc.  And many players were glad when
they finally put a level limit on KEI, since it meant that casters now
actually had to learn how to manage their mana (not to mention that
some people learned that enchanters could actually do things other
than cast KEI!).

And regarding PL'ing, wasn't their some guild on some server that
boasted having the first level 65 (and epic'ed) Froglok cleric on
their server in like only 2 days after the Froglok race came out, and
that Froglok cleric had an alteration skill of only 24?
