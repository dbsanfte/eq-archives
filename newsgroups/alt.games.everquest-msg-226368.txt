So the ~$40 for guaranteed free advanced access to a game and a chance
to help out in the developement amounting to months of entertainment
isn't just as "good", if not BETTER, a deal than ~$10 for a
30min-1hour behind the scenes documentary?

I still don't understand why you're outraged, though. It's not like
you NEED the "making of" DVD. It's a neat extra, nothing more, nothing
less. You don't NEED a spot in the EQ2 beta, either.  If you chose to
buy the XBox game for the making of DVD despite the fact you don't own
an XBox, then that's your own damn fault. You threw away money on
something you didn't need. If you bought LOE just for a slot in the
beta, you have no place to complain either. Once again, you willingly
chose to spend money on something you didn't have any need for.

Its something people are perfectly willing to do. They aren't lying to
anyone. They aren't misleading anyone. They're offering an opportunity
to get the same thing without buying the product -- buying the product
just GUARANTEES a slot. There isn't any NEED for what they're
offering.

<sarcasm>Oh, damn, they're offering to give people something extra
that they want for free to boost sales of a product. You're right,
horrible business ethics. </sarcasm>
