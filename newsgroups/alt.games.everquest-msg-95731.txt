If Verant were smart, they would hire you, Dan.  You pick apart the game in 
ways that make me wonder sometimes, yet, are exactly what their QC team 
should be doing.  Not just the Horse stuff, but other things you have 
posted about in the past.

But, if they did hire you, you'd be one of 'them' and we'd all hate you.
