And we get some really nice debuffs as we level, too. Been using these more
and more and noticing quite a difference. Have to watch the nasty agro,
though.

In my groups, I am usually responsible for DS (if we don't have a mage),
snaring, back-up healing and debuffing. I'll also use some DD's if we need
it, but generally, only cast them when I feel like watching things blow up.
