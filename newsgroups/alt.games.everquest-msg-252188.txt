Note that, at the moment, there are only some charges against the
former head of Vivendi; no trial has taken place, nor is it even sure
that one will, so talking about "criminals" is a bit premature.

(I certainly have no love for J-M Messier, independently of this)

And honestly, I doubt there's much of a relationship between the
two. Most likely, the Sierra et al affair is a pure business decision
as part of efforts to do whatever managers do when their corporation
is in trouble; their honesty or lack thereof has little to do in the
matter.

Of course, the emotional part of PC gaming companies has even less to
do in the matter.
