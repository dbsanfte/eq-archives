okay, so you cannot drop coins on the ground your carrying?  that is news to
me, I am thinking the monks must get so pissed now with copper.

I've yet to get a hit trading something from one char to another.  I have a
few times used druids to trade one item from one zone to another char in
another zone.  Believe each time I did this I payed exorbant fees for the
person being trustworthy and also being a taxi.  probably one of my more
generous days, think I gave away 2 velium jasper rings to two different
druids.  I like the idea of giving someone something for being honest.

Always trade items with a char who is high level and bored, and don't
advertise you need someone to  trade something- your asking to get cheated.
Also you preferably want this high level to be in a guild, being an officer
/ leader is even better.  The uber guilds are another big plus.  Trade items
that the person your trading with could not use with that char.  Don't
entice them to steal your junk.  Try not to trade uber items with people you
cannot completely trust.  Expect to have to go thru a ton of loop holes if
they actually do run off with your stuff.  gotta petition, gotta contact
their guild, gotta start spreading the word this high level isn't
trust-worthy, etc.  If you did your homework, you won't have to go thru
this.  Don't presume they ran off with your stuff just because the logged
off before you got back on with your other char.  Give them some time, in
case they went LD.  Make sure you both have time to trade the items, in case
something like one of you going LD is a problem.  try not trade with someone
in a huge rush who is helping you trade.

The majority of people ( about 95 % ) won't cheat you, but you need to be
prepared / take precautions so it is way less likely.

High levels don't have a ton of motive to go thru the trouble of stealing
small items (insignificant to them) and then have to deal with all the
follow up hassles with GM's, etc, with possible banning.

Finally, your way better off using these methods and having some person
trade items than trying to trade items by giving them to some orc or
throwing them on the ground.
