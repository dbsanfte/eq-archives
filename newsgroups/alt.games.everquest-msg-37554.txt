Perhaps, but how many players are there out there that had already mastered
JC and fletching, for instance? Most jewellers will be chanters, fletching
isn't exactly a useful skill for them (and JC isn't a particularly useful
skill for anyone but a chanter unless you have a good chanter friend).

If you look at the shawl quests as the caster equivalent of the ring quests
for melees, they suck by comparison. The ring quests are actually fun, the
shawl quests are mostly 'burn lots of time on cash on raising trade skills
and camping for drops on your own'.

Hopefully the 8th and later quests (if they are ever implemented) will be a
bit more quest-like and a bit less like 'new way to take cash out of the
economy by forcing people who want to do them to drop several Kpp raising
mostly useless trade skills'.

Just my opinion...
