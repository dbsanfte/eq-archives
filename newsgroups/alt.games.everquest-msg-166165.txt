One trick my iksar monk used was getting some low levels to group with him
and create a train, whereupon he pulls out his trusty Adamantite Bo Stick
(19/30 WT: 6.5 Effect: Lightning Storm) and finished them while getting
healed/helped by said party. All loot goes to party, huge number of faction
hits goes to party, no xp directly BUT the gnoll fangs do deliver hugely in
the xp front and can be good for halas faction in you aren't kos.

I got to max faction with good qeynos guard and the monks there as well,
although getting to dubious with the evil guards was much harder, and as
they guard the monk guild with a level 50+ shadow knight, and the good guys
will help him if he aggros, because good qeynos guards are the stupidest
creatures on two feet.

You know what I loved about thurgadin? One faction. Kill their enemies and
they like you. All it takes is some cheap throwing item at an elite someone
is xp grinding on, and you have a faction hit. Run around sowed, hitting
things that aren't mezzed for one or two points, and before you know it you
are ally in thurg and dubious to most vellious dragons.
