If the OP didn't want to deal with the asshole, he should have left the
group earlier.  By staying with them he gave them to believe he would
discharge his duties to the group - and that includes rezzing the guy.
Disband right after, put him on you ignore/never rezz list, blacklist
him with your guild - but discharge your responsibilities.  If I was
grouped with the OP and saw him not rez a groupmate, even an asshole,
I'd make sure my guild knew never to help him, because in doing so he
screwed the group, not just the asshole.  That sort of childish,
petty behavior is the sort that spills over into all dealings, and he
deserves a place right next to the asshole on the never group with/
allow in guild list.
