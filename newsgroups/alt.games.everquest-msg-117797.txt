Nerf? Hardly, there is a very good reason for this. On the Legend web page
it is possible to list upcoming events comprehensively - both GM and player
initiated. Ie - everything from GM controlled spider invasions of Butcher
Block down to guild XXX raiding PoG 3pm cst.

So - guild YYY knowing in advance guild XXX is starting at 3pm cst starts
their own PoG raid at 2pm cst. Attempted guzzump.

Anyway - being Legends where customer service exists, eventually a GM is
petitioned after diplomacy fails and guild YYY is summarily told to pack up
and leave by the GM. Guild YYY does not like this and GM also does not like
telling a bunch 40 bucks a month playing customers they are not fooling
anyone.

Basically they have just formalised and informing the players about what
does and will happen with regards to resource contention. It is nothing knew
for Legends - they are just streamlining what already takes place and making
tools availiable to help minimise friction. And if you want to start
organising a raid - you can check in advance where is free and where isn't
ahead of time.

It's useful. I am in a large guild currently that is powering through Epics
for members at an incredible rate - it can't be all that broken : )

A lot of people like to jump on anything they hear about Legends and put a
negative spin on it based soley on their own personal views of the pricing
structure - that is just human nature. I am having a great time on Legends
personally, and I can assure you phat loot isn't part of the equation at
all. I am still wearing exactly what I transfered in with. Unless you go
looking for Legends specific equipment in raid force anyway - the loot is
just the same as regular servers. Just less pinheads to contend with along
the way.
