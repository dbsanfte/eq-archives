Here's a few websites I've collected:

http://www.inetone.net/mshapiro/ (my fav mead site- good links too)
http://www.solorb.com/gfc/mead/mead.html
http://www.realbeer.com/
http://www.cam.org/~malak/guide.html (this site has the faq for
rec.creafts.winemaking which I used to haunt as the cider expert)
http://www.joyofwine.net/ (all of her recipes can be made as meads with
honey instead of sugar. also, i love her philosophy towards wines)

I advocate no boiling of honey. I also refuse to use sulfites- since
they give me a headache. For a five gallon batch, heat one gallon of
water to about simmer level- the idea is dissolve the honey in the
water, and no more. Add 12-18 lbs of honey, rinsing the containers with
more water to get every drop of honey. Cool (but it doesn't need to be
rapid like beer- there's no "break"ing going on). Pour into your
primary. Add the rest of the water needed to make 5 gallons. Add yeast
and yeast nutrient. Let it sit for a month or two. Rack. Let it sit for
a year or two. Then bottle. 

I did a yeast experiment with cotes des blancs, pasteur red, flor
sherry, champagne and montrachet (identical batches except the yeast).
Cotes des blanc is the most popular as far as taste, with champagne and
pasteur are close. Flor sherry gives a completely different flavor. I
haven't met one person who liked the taste of montrachet when compared
to the rest.
