I woke up this day shrugged the sand off my shoulders, the Ro sun beat down
on me like a curse.The fact that I was from the north meant nothing to the
heat.It seamed to almost provoke it.I rounded up my tent and packed it in
and was off.I soon found a group.. we were fighting the orc scourge that
frequent this strip of land they called the Orc highway.A warrior barbarian
was a good tank,as they would call it.My job was to lure orcs to our camp
where we would make short work of them. But this night would prove
different.The trips I took over the sand dunes were routine to say the least
,the usual lure then kill.Then this last time I rounded the dune, a tital
wave of orcs rushed over the dunes."Its a swarm !"I shouted...from where
they came I don't know.They swept over the dunes like water,it was a sight
to be seen.
"Runnnnn"came a shout from the mage then another "Runnnn" from the chanter.
I being the curious Northman I am ran up to the edge of the whole mess to
see the full extent....BAMM a hit from the left turned me around to see two
Orcs bashing me hard.This was all I had to see, I fled with a few hits but I
was fine.I rounded the lake and saw our Elven ranger up to her neck in
orcs....so I sliced into the green skin of the lowly orcs flesh with my
Icetooth opening up three black grooves sending it to my attention.My sarnak
eitchatka hit deep sending him to look at me.She ran as I did The swarm of
orcs were too much.The clipping attacks of the orcs seemed behind us.. until
I saw a sand giant  ,out of the frying pan into the fire.I turned to yell at
her to run... but it was my stopping that sealed her doom for she stopped as
well, giving the horrible giant enough time to bash her...alas I and only
one other from our group of 6 did survive this adventure.
