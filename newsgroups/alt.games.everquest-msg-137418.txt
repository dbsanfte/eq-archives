Lol, let's all have a nuclear bomb in case a terrorist tries to use one.

OK, so you have a gun and someone is knifing someone else, do you use the
gun? OK, so you have a gun and someone is punching and kicking someone else,
do you use the gun? OK, so you have a gun and someone is swearing at and
berating someone else, do you use the gun? OK, so you have a gun and your
spouse has just told you they are having an affair, do you use the gun? OK,
so you have a gun and you're on a bench in the park and a dog comes up and
shits on your shoes, do you use the gun? On the dog? On the owner?

"The facts simply do not justify that conclusion."?? Two facts do not a
conclusion make.

A decent gun-carrier is an oxymoron. A gun-carrier is a moron.

This year's "reluctant hero" is next year's "homicidal maniac".

The answer is a complete ban on firearms and stiffer penalties for
non-compliance. In this day and age there is absolutely no need for anyone
to carry a firearm (except, perhaps, in the arena of law enforcement).

and, who determines that you are an honest citizen? So, tomorrow, you're in
the park and a dog shits on the shoes of the little old white Jewish guy on
the next bench. The little old guy yells out at the owner of the dog, the 6'
tall, 220 lb black guy with the mohican haircut and the rings through his
nose, and then picks up a rock and throws it at the dog. The dog snarls at
the little old white Jewish guy. The black guy approaches the bench cursing
and swearing, raises his hand as if to strike the little old man and then
reaches into his pocket and starts to pull out something that looks like a
knife and then lunges towards the little old man, do you use the gun? On the
dog? On the owner? Now they're dead and it turns out that the man was
swearing at himself for forgetting the scoop-a-poop bag and he was cursing
the dog for snarling at the poor little old man and then he was going to
pick the shit up by hand and suddenly realised that he had that silver
cigarette case in his pocket, a present from the local orphan home for his
devoted service over the last twenty years, and that he could use it to pick
up the shit. Now you're dead because the little old Jewish guy was carrying
a gun too and, anyway, he likes dogs and, anyway, he hates interfering
busybodies like you and, anyway, you're Hispanic and he hates them worse
than the blacks and, anyway, you just shot an innocent person (and the dog
too) and he is just being a reluctant hero.

When does the "honest citizen", who misunderstood the situation, become the
"homicidal maniac"?

It is a moot point whether "honest citizens" believe they should carry arms.
It is a moot point whether "honest citizens" believe that anyone should have
the choice to carry arms. You attack my honesty and integrity by insinuating
that my belief, that only authorized personnel (those who are members of a
recognised body of law enforcement) should carry a firearm, is incorrect.
