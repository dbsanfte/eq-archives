I have the  ASUS V7100 MX1 32MB, basically the same as every other
GeForce2 MX, except with a bit faster RAM. It works fine in both 2D
apps and EQ. I wouldn't buy the cheapest GeForce MX card, though. They
are probably the 16MB version, and you want the 32MB at least. I
didn't bother with the 64MB because of the reduced data path of the
MX. All that extra RAM is just wasted when you only have 2 busses
IMHO. The regular GeForce2 has 4, and there you might see some
improvement in the 64MB card over the 32MB, but the GeForce2 costs
twice as much. I paid $150 for my card back in October, and I am happy
with my purchase.
