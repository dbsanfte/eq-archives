I got a mission in Qeynos Harbour to visit Crater Lake. I did, and
received a Small Lab Flask. It told me I might want to show it to

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
