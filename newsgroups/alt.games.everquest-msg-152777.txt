OK, Sure my OP was just "my" way of how I see EQ. But what is
considered a sensible comment in here?

I've seen people ask questions that go unanswered by "The Mighty Few"
here that seem to know everything.

Yet, they love to answer questions that have no answer, like when does
Ragefire spawn.Or they answer stupid topics like why people name their
player character "Fyghter" when it's spelled "Fighter". Pretty stupid
topic to discuss.
