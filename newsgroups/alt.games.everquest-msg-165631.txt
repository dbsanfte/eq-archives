Ah. Thankyou, I was unaware of that. I thought the knights capped
similarly and ranger offense advantage was made up largely in
the dual wield. Maybe I'll see if I can find a knight and ranger with
the same 2h'er to parse against... In fact, I bet the emperor
fight will have everyone using bane 2h'ers...

...damn. That falls foul of your high AC rule.

Does anyone with experience of both classes at a high level have
any comment on how much ranger offense/dual wield really compares
to knight 2h'ers?
