>at kiting. So I just don't do it :) )

Any Druids that still kite do not know how to play the class. (With
the exception of Quad-Kiting at the higher levels)

Root/Dotting is the best way of killing with a Druid. Especially now
that Root has been fixed and stacks with Snare. Nothing beats medding
back most of the mana you expend on a kill, while the creature just
stands there and dies. This tactic even works in dungeons, where most
druids don't know their arse from a gnoll on the ground :-).

Cheers
