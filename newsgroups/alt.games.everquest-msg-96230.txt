While getting a horse is not a priority of mine, I have seen several of
them...  One in Halas (which I didn't think was possible...  LOL), another
was going through Nek Forest, and more in Qeynos Hills and South Karana as
well as Freeport area.  I can't seem to hang onto plat long enough to save
that much, but as I said, no matter to me.  I'd rather buy better armor and
weapons when I get the cash...

But, while we are on the subject of a large amount of plat, is the GBS that
Pzjin drops still worth 10k plat?  Not that I'll ever get her to drop it of
course, but just curious...
