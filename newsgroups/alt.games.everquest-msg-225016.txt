(Keep in mind I'm the whiny cleric who normally ends up spending more per day
on dots / kei than I make...):  I am using my Fine Antique ring, (mana
preservation II) Fine Antique velvet rose, (extended range II, helps on
Pacify), Amulet of Insight, (Extended Enhancement III).
Improved healing III items run more than 10KP on my server - yes, I'm saving
for one...
No AA, I'm debating whether I should head that direction, BUT!  everyone says
you should do Run Speed first.....???

Sigh, the ranger could NOT get rid of aggro.  I'm assuming she was snare
pulling when mana permitted, (she was out of mana alot too...).  Plus *I'm
guessing* she was taunting.  It appeared she was only using one weapon, but
it's hard to tell sometimes graphics are funny...
The druid was using the *group DS* - if she wasn't clicking it off that
certainly didn't help...

On the warrior he was usually at 25-30 when it hit.  Ranger even lower, because
she was gettting hit a lot harder...
I have a hot key set up for healing, a couple of times the druid had to throw
in a little heal before mine would hit her...

Grin.  I'll be talking to the chanter tonight :)  He was also master looter... 
Both the chanter and the necro had a hard time NOT getting agro when they cast.
Thanks for the advice - really!  We want better groups :)
The other thing I have a problem with is:  Giving Direction.  I thought the
warrior should be pulling, and he suggested it AFTER the Ranger said she wanted
to (duh!).    But the ranger said no, she'd done it before and knew how. 
Whatever.  Well, I guess I'm going to have to stop having the *whatever*
attitude....
