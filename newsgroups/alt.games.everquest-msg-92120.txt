Two good ways to raise a low skill are: 1. Raise it in a group where you
have other party members to deal dammage and taunt.  2.  Find a group and
ask them if you can practice your skill on their pulls.  There is no
possible way you will taunt the mob from them and it's a relatively safe way
to get skill ups.  The down side is that you get no xp from them.
