We might get lucky here because the guide hasn't come out yet. The one for
EQL came out on the day of release and as you stated was based on early
beta data and pretty useless. But since it's delayed it might be in better
shape than most of their guides. I get them myself for nostalgia reasons, I
bought the original prima guide for EQL with it and every one since (at
least till I quit). It's nice to look and see the 989 logo on it instead of
SOE when I'm pissed at them and sigh of what could have been.

If you go flying back through time and you see somebody else flying forward
into the future, it's probably best to avoid eye contact.
