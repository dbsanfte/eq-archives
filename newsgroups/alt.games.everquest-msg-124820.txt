    I saw it for the first time last weekend.  My guild was doing an AC hunt, and
Lenny and I were doing our part by killing anything that moved.  Lenny saw a spider
that he thought was off in the distance, and ran over to slay it.  He didn't have to
run nearly as far as he thought he would, and he died within 5 seconds.   I made it
to the zone, barely.  And it laid waste to one of our higher level members, too.  
    Huge spider indeed.
