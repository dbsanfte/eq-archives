  Yes, this is true.  And it's a bit puzzling.  How many CE actually get
made using the high level research words?  Why even bother creating
these recipes when Scent of Marr works find and is available in bulk for
cheap?  You can _sell_ the higher level research works to a vendor for
more than the SoM costs.  I just find it weird.
