I see.  I still maintain that most people will accept a port to BB instead
of GFay, and vice versa.  Were I to play a porting class, I would offer the
service interchangably. Of course, I would remind the other player that I
can only get to the one place.

No, but it's a good generalization.  Then again, there are bound to be
errors in any generalization.  Still, I don't think the druid was obligated
to refund the money... although some fault lies with him for not specifying
where he was going, OP does bear some responsibility for not knowing what he
was getting in to.  One shouldn't use things they don't understand.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
