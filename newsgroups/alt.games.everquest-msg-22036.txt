You wouldn't believe how inventive PK's can be... on second thoughts, maybe
you would. I just can't see any good coming from it. Be careful of what you
wish for.

Perhaps the act of begging could trigger a Spell of Ironic Displacement,
whereby a horde of nasty miniature goblins circle the beggar's head,
imploring him to hand over his earwax and nasal hairs, all the while
intoning "We are your personal gadflies".
