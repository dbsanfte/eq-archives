Unfortunately, unless this has changed VERY recently, those spells can't 
be purchased on Luclin.  At least not in Shar Vahl.  I play a Beastlord, 
and these 2 spells in particular are shared.  And I had to venture to 
the Barbarian land in order to find them. Also, you'll notice that you 
can't find Flash of Light (not sure if Shaman get it, I think they do 
though).  It can be found at any cleric, druid guild though.  Hope that 
helps you some.
