All true, except that 50 and 60 are not hell levels...51-(especially)59
are.

The reason for the massive loss in the level-after-hell is because your
death loss is based on the amount of experience that you needed to get your
previous level. Since going from 45 to 46 takes like 30% more xp than going
46 to 47, you are losing a comparitively large chunk. At 60th, since 59 is
the hell-level-to-beat-all-hell-levels, you lose just a little over a full
yellow bubble with each death. Fortunately, 60 is a lightweight, and you
get it back pretty quickly.
