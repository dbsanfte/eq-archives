I am a level 40 ranger.  The spells I use most are on pages 1 and 2.  (Major
healing, sow, steel skin, thistle shield, stinging swarm, flame lick).  The
rest are a disorganized mess in the following pages.  (Rangers don't get that
many spells...)
Major healing is always memmed in slot 1.  Sow is always memmed in slot 2. 
Root is always in the last slot.  Snare is always in the next to last slot. 
The middle slots vary depending on where I am.
