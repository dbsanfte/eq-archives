I forget the formula too, but from casters realm.
LVL 24 Int 135 = 696

LVL 24 with 203 = 1025 (+329)
The additiona 135 mana makes it 1160 (+464)
Or 167% of original mana.

Well about 2/3rds extra mana must make some difference.
However it does not do what twinking melees does.

Better weapon increases damage/second
Better Armour reduces down time
Regen reduces down time

So less down time and more kills per second (or hour if you prefer)

On a caster 60% extra mana only really gives extra safty, and I guess
means that they can take out some Red / Yellow mobs. 

Has your Wiz got items that let him regen mana faster ?
Or focus items to let him do more dammage per second ?
Or focus items to let him use less mana per spell ?

They would be the equivilent of Melee twinking.
