Ah, you picked a nice zone. :)  Zone area should be great for you...if you
get brave after you're acclimated you might want to check out more of it.
Keep in mind that if you go deeper, FORGET ALL AE SPELLS as they will surely
get you killed.  No AE stuns, no AE nukes, no AE mezzes.

The only thing bad about hunting at the zone line is that there are a lot of
epic stuff to be done in that zone, and occasionally you'll have to QUIETLY
accept the fact that any time a raid is being organized, the chances of you
getting nearly as many critters is significantly reduced, due to the
raider's boredom, stupidity, bad manners, or a combination of the
three...and that's BEFORE the raid starts.  Of course the first thing
they'll do AFTER it starts is kill all the critters that are in their way,
including the zone line.
