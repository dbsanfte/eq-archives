   Thanks for the advice, gentlemen.  

    It does sound like actual dye packs might be a bit too nasty for me to
use for the purpose intended, even if I could get a hold of one.  The idea
of the skin contact dye sounded like a great compromise, but unfortunately
I can't seem to find any for sale of the web (found lots of places that
sell fake vomit and soap that turns your hands black in my search,
though).  I live pretty much out in the middle of nowhere and have no idea
where the nearest magic supply store might be... though this might bear
investigating when I do have some time off.  If someone can point me in the
direction of a online vendor that would be even better.

    While I like the idea of the burrito, our particular thief seems to
target tv dinners (mine, and other people have been hit as well).  Perhaps
I could peel off the plastic covering of the dish carefully resealing it
afterwards, and slip some under some turkey or something, but I have a
feeling that trip through the microwave would smell bad enough to tip them
off. 

   I'm thinking that maybe just going with some non subtle dye coating on
the outside of the dinner might do.  After all, how many people examine the
dinner as they pull it out of the box?  The problem is that I work in a
factory that produces vinyl products (think cup insulators) and I work in
the finishing department which silk-screen prints logos and such onto the
parts.  It's not too hard to get a hold of the chemicals that wash off most
inks pretty fast.

   So, any ideas of what I might be able to smear over the dinner that
would stain someone's hands?  Something that might soak in before a solvent
could be applied to wash it off?  I think it would be pretty easy to reseal
the box using glue, so I'm not to worried about that part.  I'm thinking
that whomever is doing the stealing is probably working fast, to minimize
his or her chances of getting caught.
