Hi all,

I've been trying to find out how to calculate the maximum damage for a
weapon. I've searched the archives and found:

[(Strength+Weapon skill/100)*(Weapon Damage)]+Level Damage Bonus=Maximum
Damage

but that doesn't seem to work in my case.

I play a L61 Shaman, using a Dathor Great Hammer (74/95 2H Blunt). Plugging
in the figures gives:

[(260+200/100)*74)+0=340

However, ever since I got the hammer a few levels back my maximum hit has
been for 310, and that's after 6000 or so hits (according to an EQLog
parse). The mode is 148 (2832 hits), with only 73 at 149. There are
significant bumps every 7 or 8 damage below that (min 7, then 14, 22, 30
etc, which suggests that 7.4 is involved somewhere).

Raising ATK hasn't altered the max hit (normal ATK in the mid 900s, buffing
to the mid 1100s helped get more 310s over the course of a couple of hours
but nothing more).

So, does anyone know what the true formula is?

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help!
