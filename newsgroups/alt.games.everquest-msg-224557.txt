Y'know how sometimes you get someone in your group that seems really
distracted?  Usually it's for a good reason--kids are sick, dogs and cats
wreaking havoc, roommate making noise, whatever.  Every now and then though,
you get someone who can't juggle EQ and watching TV, and you catch 'em at
it.  No biggie.

I was in a group with a couple of guys that knew each other a while back.
One of them kept missing fights, forgetting to turn on attack, stuff like
that.  We were doing okay so we weren't real worried, but he clearly wasn't
there.  Finally his buddy said, "John, put down the damn Gameboy and play
EQ."

He was on the ball after that.

Another time, waaaaaaaay back in the early days of EQ before you could even
get a port around Norrath--a 29 or higher Druid was a rarity, and a Wizard
that high was almost unheard of--I was setting out on my then-greatest EQ
adventure with my leveling buddies.  We were a warrior and two shamans,
12-14, and making our first cross-Norrath run, scared witless.  (We'd heard
that people would donate a plat for a sow in Greater Faydark.  A whole
plat!!)  We left Everfrost, cut through BB and Qeynos Hills, and figured,
"Well, we hear there's BANDITS on the shoreline, so let's take the zone wall
instead.  It should be safe."

Halfway across the zone--which was still 20 minutes or more into our long
journey--our other Shaman suddenly died.  The warrior and I stopped and
tried to get his attention in group to no avail.  A few minutes later we
hear, "What happened?" from him.

"You died."

"Oh.  How?"

"You fell off the wall."

"Oh.  BRT.  Heh sorry, I was on autofollow and was watching a movie on my
handheld DVD player."

We both smacked him. :D  (And went on to remain friends, acquire many levels
together, with both Shaman eventually becoming DE Warriors--but that's
another story.)
