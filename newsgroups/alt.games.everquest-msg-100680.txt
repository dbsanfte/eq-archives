> Now that Pallies can Rez... expect to see Warriors getting asked for them

Only fair other melees get pestered a little ;)

My dorf pally in DW and Ro armour with either a 2hs axe or 1hs sword +
shield has been asked for SoW and Ports several times...

More surprisingly once outside Kaladim I was standing still in
tell-hell. I was not /role or /anon, full name with guildtag and all.
Then this guys runs up to me, apparently takes me for a merchant and
trades me some spider legs and beetle eyes or so. I was so baffled I
just barely managed a 'huh?'. Then he darted away. When I finished
laughing I checked if someone had auctioned for the junk. No one had.
