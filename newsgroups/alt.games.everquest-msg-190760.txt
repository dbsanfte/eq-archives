I am guessing you are either talking to them in some way without using the
channel commands, like /say and /group and /ooc and /shout (a lot of people
turn off /ooc and /shout display though), or you are talking to non-player
characters run by the game. Try clicking on them to make them your target,
and hitting H for Hail. Another clue is the colour of their names. Light
blue names are not real people, dark blue names are real people.
