Sure I do. I use that time to read or do something non-EQ related.

At a certain point in the game, the guild *is* the game. You rise or
fall based on what your guild accomplishes. The membership gives their
loyalty to the leadership and trusts them to make decisions for what
will best serve the guild and get better equipped than they could
possibly be in smaller or less organized groups.

If you want to play at the upper levels, find a guild in which you can
do this. If you can't find one or can't imagine yourself in that kind
of arrangement, do us all a favor and don't join a high-end  raiding
guild.

A good 70% of intraguild strife comes from the rank-and-file assuming
it knows better than the leadership, but not wanting to assume the
responsibility for keeping things running.

I've been at all levels in a guild at one time or another and I have
to say that I enjoy, "Point me at something and tell me when to poke
it" best.
