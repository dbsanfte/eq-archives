    It was a worn effect. The change happened when ATK and haste percentages
(amongst other things) were changed to be explicitly stated on the item, and
not hidden in some effect name like Aura of Bravery. Too many people were
getting confused as to whether, for example, the Aura of Eternity (worn) on
Necklace of Celestial Energy, which gave 5 regen and 5 mana regen, would
stack with Flowing Thought and count against the worn mana regen cap or not.
Now the Necklace reads Regeneration 5, Mana Regeneration 5, and it's obvious
it counts towards the 15 mana regen cap.

    The BER epic does have some steps that can challenge a group of 65's,
which most of the old epics cannot say. In particular the Fear step can be
dicey. As for stat comparison, all the DPS melee epics still look pretty
good by modern standards when you consider the 40% haste 40 ATK on them.
About the only one you can replace today with Bazaar gear would be the monk
epic, as ornate gloves have the same right-click as the monk epic.

    You must be talking about the WAR epic, and it was pretty sad even when
it was released. It has to rate as pretty much the bottom of the effort vs.
reward curve for epics.

    The devs were asking for ideas for the right-click on several of the
epics on the new whineplay boards. One thing mentioned is there will be
recast delays on the new epics, so even if the right-click is really good,
odds are the recast will nerf it back into being OK. I'm hoping the cleric
shield (we get a shield, not a weapon) will have some sort of Force
Shield-like right click - that would rock.
