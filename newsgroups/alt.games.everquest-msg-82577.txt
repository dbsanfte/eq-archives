You probably do, but umm
the page is down on Dell, so I cant look it up for you
all I can really tell you is look inside your case (after unplugging the
power cord) and look behind where your monitor plugs into on the tower. now,
at the base of the card, on the motherboard, there is a slot the card fits
in to
I cant find any good pages to explain, so umm lets try this

http://www.pcchips.com/product/socket_7/m571lmr/m571lmr.gif

look at the above image... there are 2 black slots all the way to the left.
those are ISA slots, pretty much extinct now... the ones to the right, the 3
white ones, are PCI. thats what most cards (non-graphics) use now.

OK that one - look for the 2 PCI slots, there is a small slot to the left,
thats not it, thats for modems. the one to the right is an AGP slot.
Sometimes there will be a small divider where the card plugs in but there
doesnt have to be one... anyways, all the ones I have seen were brown so
far, but I never fixxed a Dell before that had an AGP slot so who knows.
Anyways, if you find one of those then youre all set. Looking at the stats
you listed from here, and the limited info I saw at Dell's site, as long as
you do have an AGP slot, it is most likely AGP2x, it could even be 4
Another thing you might want to do, while your system is starting up at the
beginning, you can hit a key to go into setup, look around for anything AGP,
but dont change anything unless you know what it is, anyways just poke
around and if you do see an AGP option, see what you can do with it, you
might be able to adjust the mode between 1 2 and 4. then exit without saving
and change if you get your card

OK if you can make any sense of that, hope it helps...
