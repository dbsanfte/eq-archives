I skipped run altogether on my BL as he has both SOW cast ability
and a mount.

I went through the same thing, all my friends telling me I
**MUST** get run3. My advice is dont pay attention to any advice
in re this. LOOK at the AA's yourself and figure out which you
want, which you need as prerequisites to other AA's further up
the ladder. If run seems right for your character, then go for
it, otherwise, stick it on a back burner.

When I got to my cleric though, I gave the run aa a bit higher
priority as he can't cast sow on himself.
