(Note, snipping a lot of point B stuff that the following was placed 
after... I'm not trying to twist words around thru snipping, but this 
last paragraph really looks like it belongs with this first half of the 
discusion to me.)

See above, a small set of groups which happen to support top posting 
doesn't prove that the majority of groups on usenet do.

Similarly, finding sets of parents who's children all come in sets of 
twins doesn't prove that the majority of children are twins.

Even if your only friends are all parents of twins, it still doesn't 
prove that the majority of children are twins.

If you only frequent groups where top posting is the norm, that doesn't 
prove that top posting is the norm on usenet at large (it doesn't 
disprove it, and its nice anecdotal evidence pointing in that 
direction... but its far from a proof)

Also, you have to consider the cause effect relationships at work here; 
perhaps you frequent those groups because they favor top posting.

And you have to look at the nature of the groups themselves; are they 
the sort of groups where one posting style might be favored over another 
for one reason or another?

On AGE, we see lots of long involved conversations with multiple points 
being made in each post.  Context posting works here because it allows 
each point in a given post to be clearly responded to, and 
conversational threading to be clearly delineated.

On groups where most posts are short and to single or low number of 
points, bottom posting or even top posting (as long as one or the other 
  is followed consistently) work fine.

And if threads themselves are short, then any sort of posting strategy 
doesn't devolve into a big mess; it isn't your response to someone thats 
trouble, so much as your response (top posted) to someone's response 
(bottom posted) to your response (top posted) to someone's response 
(contextually posted) to an original point; thats where mixed posting 
styles get really annoying, with the single response strategy, seeing 
one person do things one way and the next another isn't really more than 
a mild annoyance.

None of the groups you name seem to me like the sort that would devolve 
into long involved conversations... although personally I'm too lazy to 
check.

Splendid
