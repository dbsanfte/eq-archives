  Well, I have to disagree.  Basically it seems to me the group was
doing well hunting an area, and when somebody else came along and
decided he wanted to kill some goblins too, they told him to leave.
The guy didn't want to, and that's his right, they have no "ownership"
over the area.   Then instead of proposing to share the camp, they go
and train the guy.  Yeah, that's some REALLY admirable behavior.

  On top of that, there are two sides to every story.  I'm not very
impressed by this group's behavior just hearing THEIR account of the
story.  I'm sure the other guy would have a story to tell that differs
from theirs somewhat.

  I'm not saying he wasn't a jerk, maybe he was.  But training someone
because they're killing some mobs is just immature behavior,
especially if you make almost no effort to resolve the conflict before
resorting to such drastic measures.
