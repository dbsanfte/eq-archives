I went to dreadlands today, and found a druid camping the skeletons near the
portal. He told me he was leaving soon, but to be wary of this gnome, who
kept trying to steal his kills. Sure enough, as i was fighting, this nuke
from that gnome lands on my skellie and he takes off. I'm a monk, i can't
root or anything to slow the skellie down so i can finish him off. So he
kills the skellie and kills off. I go back for another skellie. Same thing
happens.I challenge him and he says they have no record of who hit what
first, so i can't prove a thing. I petitioned him anyway, as did my team
mate, but eventually we had to gate out when he trained my friend with the
full camp.

The guide told me later he had been warned, but i don't know how effective
that is? Does anyone know if what the gnome said was true?

The irony was if he'd asked to share the camp, i would have said fine, but i
guess it's easy for a wizard to nuke an already injured mob than to fight a
fresh one?
