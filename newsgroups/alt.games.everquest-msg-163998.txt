Well its a problem because you shouldnt have to have a HoH flag to have a
reasonable shot at 63/64 spells.

Haha.  You fucking stud.  You didnt kill shit, your guild did.  Dont fool
yourself into thinking you are the shit because you are in a guild that
killed AD.  Just because you are in a guild capable of killing him doesnt
make you an exceptional player.  You really believe you are better than me
or more entitled to something because of your guildtag?

VP was end game for Kunark.  HoH is not.  Slight difference there, champ.

I didnt yell nerf nerf you fucking moron.  You quoted some of what I posted,
did you read it?  I want the spectral drops boosted outside of HoH, thats
it.

about

Yes because only people whose guilds can kill AD are putting effort into EQ.
Get a clue you short sighted dipshit.  You have no fucking idea what kind of
effort I have or havent put into EQ, and just because someone is in a top
guild doesnt mean they are more skilled or put in more effort than the next
guy.  I will grant you that its not coincidence that the same guilds are
riding high with each expansion, but dont delude yourself with fantasies
that being in one of those guilds automatically makes you some kind of
badass or even an above average player.
