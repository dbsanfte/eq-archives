I am constantly reminded when seeing responses like the ones notated with 
this thread, as to why it's worth staying with EQ... I've tried EQII, WoW, 
Guild Wars and others, and keep returning home...

You are all part of a unique breed that I'm proud to be learning from.

Keep up the good work, and keep passing along great info for relative newbs 
to the game like myself.

Thanx again...
