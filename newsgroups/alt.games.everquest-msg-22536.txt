Fair enough, but we were talking about Befallen. I've been in AoE groups
outside before, but I'd be reluctant to use AoE to pull indoors. To find
a safe spot to pull from you'd need to know what is in the room above
and below you, and behind any walls - I can't actually see through
floors myself.

I'd be worried after pulling my group of mobs back to the designated
safe spot, that there was an additional growing horde of mobs still on
their way up from the floor below or wherever.
