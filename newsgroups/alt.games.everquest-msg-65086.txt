}been trying forever to DL _verQuest.exe after DLing the supposedly the

}stupid patching is even useful, I mean why not just throw up a bunch of
}files that we could DL to get this thing going.  and while we are at it, why
}bother to implement a new patcher until after we were done with doing SOL.
}seems this whole thing is a major pain, and I'm not at all impressed with
}their technology.

This sounds like a problem I had yesterday... It would make the little 
teeny patching window, and hang in the middle of '_verquest.exe', about 
half the time with an error message about possibly not being authorized to 
access that file and checking with my system adinistrator.

Although it doesn't say it in the printed manual installation 
instructions, on the web site it says to turn off your virus checker 
before trying to install SoL.  So... it turned out my virus checker didn't 
have an off button, and I had to uninstall it, but then it worked.  Of 
course then it went into the big patch window and started into 6 hours of 
downloading files... Which woulda been less if my ISP didn't hang up so 
much... But at least that one symptom got better. :)

So when my computer comes down with a cold, I'm gonna instruct it to cough 
all over Verant.  Looks to me like this may mean I'll have to uninstall my 
virus checker every time there's a patch... Oy, I hope not.
