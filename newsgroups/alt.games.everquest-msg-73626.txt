Don't you think that is a design flaw? Yes equipment should influence
a charater, but not define a character. Even still when the issue here
isn't what defines a character its about keeping money moving. Its
been admited that the problem with the horses is that people are
saving up their money. Nobody is buying. This is the same thing thats
happening in the real world right now. The economy is falling back
because people are saving money. They are saving for an uncertain
future, rather than to buy something expensive, but the effect on the
economy is the same.

If there were decay, I think this would improve the horse situation
because people would still be buying. They would have to otherwise all
their equipment would wear out. My main character is a level 17
warrior who has a difficult time scrounging up 200 plat. I can get my
hands on all sorts of resources like silk, bone, ect. But there is a
very small market for any of that. perhaps if silk robes got holes in
them then there would be a greater demand for silk.

The idea is to get a blanced economy while not detracting from the
adventure. If the economy is too balanced, then people spend a
signifigant portion of their time working their skills, which leaves
little time for adventure. Too much adventure and plat becomes
devalued and money sinks are required. Its been a problem since the
first days of MUDs. A free rpg might not have the same problems
because people don't pay and get the 'I paid for adventure' attitude.
Verant because people pay them are limited by what they can do.
Characters don't grow old in EQ because this would piss off paying
customers.

Of course selling horses for many kiloplat doesn't solve the problem
in the long term either. Say you go out an buy a 9K horse. At some
point you are going to want to sell it. odds are you are going to want
to sell it for more than 9K. You can't sell at a loss because there is
more money in Norrath now than last week. Why? Because mobs still drop
loot. The horse that cost 9K now will cost 10K later this spring. It
will only get worse because players will save more and more money.
They key here is to control the flow of money into and out of the
population. Once inflation is under control players can spend less
time working on getting 100 Kiloplat and concentrate on doing the work
needed to get a horse. (money is not a measurement of work.)
