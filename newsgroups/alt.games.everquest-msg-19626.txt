Hell levels affect all PC's, regardless of race or class. I believe they
originated as a bug, but were left in as "intended" gameplay. The hell
levels, IIRC, are 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50-60. The hell levels basically
require a significant amount more experience to achieve the next level.
Additionally, after each Hell Level, there is a Hell Loss level, during
which a death will cause more of an xp loss than in normal levels.
