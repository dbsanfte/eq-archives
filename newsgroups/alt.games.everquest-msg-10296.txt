They can be warriors, shaman, shadow knights or (the worst) necromancers.
Just wait til you have 3 furbies after you, 1 necro, 1 SK and 1 shaman.  My
monk has had mnay times when camping in the bug room was preferable to
trying to fight his way out.  Then there's the Harm Touch.  2 SKs aggroed at
the same time and he lost 302 hps in the blink of an eye (needless to say,
he did not make it).  It gets better after about lvl 18 when there are a lot
fewer that con blue/white/yellow to you.  Don't get me wrong, it's a lot of
fun esp since their aggro range is relatively short within the confines of
Kurns and you can pull just 1 or 2  at a time, it's just sometimes, you get
more than you can control.
