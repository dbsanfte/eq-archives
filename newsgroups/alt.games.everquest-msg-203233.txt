This is exactly why they changed the grouping experience in the last
patch - to make it more worthwhile. These changes (with the high level
spell fix) will never prevent you from soloing.

One thing Sony has focused on is the dependance of the classes on
other classes. Personally, I think this is a really good idea. It
gives each class thier strengths and weaknesses and really defines the
roles of each class. When you bring a group together, its where this
game really shines, when you get a group that works well together and
compliments each others abilities. The last patch only enhances this
concept. EQ really isnt about soloing, although it is a path many
take, and can still take.

Ive played a few online RPGs and the ones that are level and class
based I personally like the best. I appreciate the structure. Some may
not. I recall my UO days where a majority of the players were
essentially the same - tank mages. While it is an intruiging concept
to be able to develop whatever skills you desire without restrictions,
it basically boiled down to everyone developing the same set of skills
(for the most part - and btw - i draw my experiences from UO based on
the first year or so it was out - havent played it in years).

Its exhillerating when you discover how well the classes in EQ work
together, and how you become a better player when you discover this.
