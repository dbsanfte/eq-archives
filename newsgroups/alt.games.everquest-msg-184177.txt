Perhaps.  However, legalities aside, I know what we were told.  I know what
happened, because I lived through it.  And I'd be willing to bet that our
case isn't an isolated incident.

When you boil it down, we really are in SOE's world now.  We can only go by
what we are told by persons of authority within that world, and then use
that information make decisions accordingly.

And, ultimately I'm still convinced that what we've done has rid us of the
problem once and for all.
