You can also put the pauses on the same line as the auctions.  However, the "/pause," has to come at the BEGINNING of the line.  So, "/pause
10,/auc WTS item" will do the "/auc WTS item" and THEN will pause for 10.  This lets you get more lines on one button, but doesn't make it
easy to edit the length of the pauses (since when you click on a line it gets deleted and you have to retype the entire line).
