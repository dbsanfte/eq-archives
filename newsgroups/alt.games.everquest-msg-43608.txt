Whoa hold on honcho, I included this because the first fellow was
complaining about the lack of combat animations. First person is quite
playable, it just doesn't feel as alive as it does in EQ.

I don't play DAoC in third person view. I might in the future because
of PvP concerns but atm I don't have a problem playing in first.

I don't want to put anyone off of DAoC here (or EQ for that matter, I
am a big fan of EQ too). DAoC will be worth trying for yourself. No
one can tell you what is better, only their own experiences.
