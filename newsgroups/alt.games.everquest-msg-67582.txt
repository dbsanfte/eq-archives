	Outdoors, yes.  Indoors, no.

	FUCK PvP.

	PvP is a *MINOR* point in this game.  It has no standing in rules issues.

	Trick question; the Ranger is the superior choice because in any situation
in which he can have SoW, he can have invis too.  In practice, either will do.
Of course, in practice you can usually get a_rogue_twink47 to pull your
corpse.

|You complain you

	So?  I agree, bind rules should be equal for all classes.  Next.

|You are really
|lucky (Thanks Aradune imo, he helps on ranger improvement -unbalance?-)

	Uh, no.  "Aradune" kept the class DOWN.  McQuaid took personal
responsibility for the condition of the class post-Kunark, when we were gimped
beyond belief.  He was responsible for taking away our ability to either tank
or deal damage.  On the Glade he is known as the only Ranger with a backstab
key.

|If melee can bind, imagine on pvp server. 

	As I said, screw the PVP servers.  I really don't care what happens on
them; anyone stupid enough to play PVP deserves anything they get while doing
so.

|A big unbalance, this is why bind points for melee are located
|in towns where guards are !

	No, bind rules are as they are due to bullshit "Vision" reasons.

|You need a bind at gate, you need a tp, a tl, a heal, a rez, a sow, a cure,
|sumoned stuff, buff, endure breath, imbued stuff ? VI makes us in need to
|ask something everytime. This is why everybody communicate. By this, you
|need to speack others, to group, to meet people. This create the social part
|of this game. The lack of abilities of a class is the advantage of another.
|A little 8 caster will be proud to bind the great 50+ ranger, and even more
|if he receive a sow in reward or few plats.

	That's the theory.  In practice it doesn't work.

	If I were offered a million bucks I couldn't tell you the name of the last
person who bound me.  I have gotten tired of spending 20+ minutes offering
plat for a bind -- too many people are too twinked, they don't need the money
unless you offer outrageous amounts.  (No, I am not paying 100 pp for a bind.)
Casters don't regard bind/SoW/ports/TLs as a way to make connections any more,
or even as a source of income; they regard them as burdens.  That's why so
many casters in this game run around anon/RP.  They don't want to be bothered.

	People in muds socialize because it is virtually impossible to stop them
from socializing.  (I hear AO and DAoC are working on it.)  The one thing
designers should have learned from UO is that muds are not sociology
laboratories where you can try out your personal bullshit theories.  They are
entertainment services, and the only thing that matters is whether or not
people have fun using them.  Spending half or more of your playing time trying
to get bound is NOT FUN.

	And BTW, a level 8 caster isn't binding anyone; they don't get the spell
until 12 (INT) or 14 (WIS).
