Definitely great ideas.  They'd make about the same or more with your idea.
Verant did come out with prepaid access cards, maybe they'll catch on with
this one.  Since you can put the software on as many computers as you need,
the key is the only thing that's important. It's not like they update the
initial CD's, you still end up with a HUGE patch the first time you run
something that's been out for a while.
