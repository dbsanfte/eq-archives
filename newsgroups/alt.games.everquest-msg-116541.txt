Ok, how long of a refresh is Trueshot?  30mins? 1 hour?    Being able to do
more damage that infrequently hardly counts as an overall higher damage
dealer.

I posted a log here a while back that Arolpin parsed to be around 200DPS,
that was unbuffed, unhasted (except my own haste) versus something in Velks.
Since then I've got primal fistwraps (safehouse said avater is something
like a 30% dps increase), ambidexterity (6-10% dps increase?)

I know theres a big difference between a Velks mob and Klandikar, but even
so..

1 thing tho (and im an archery noob so correct me if im wrong).. arrows do
double damage when the mob isn't moving, but isn't rooted, right?   I find
it hard to believe that EVERY single arrow hit for double damage, especially
on a mob like Kland - who isn't rooted, can't be pinned, ae-fears etc...
