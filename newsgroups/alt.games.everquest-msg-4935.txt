Well, I did for a while, but you see, he keeps invoking my name. What can I
tell you, I'm just not a "turn the other cheek" kind of person.

I certainly don't invade threads that actually have any bearing on the game.
The threads in which I respond to bizbee are all clearly labelled as
off-topic subjects, easy for most people to ignore should they wish to.

I'll tell you what I will do, I won't post another thing about him unless he
starts first. I'll even let him get a free shot in at the FAQ, which I am
about to post.

If I could be any fairer than that, I'd have blond children
