Its been far too long since I ran a bard, but as I recall the lower level
spells are found in

Freeport
Qeynos
Kelethin
Highhold Pass

If you can afford it, the trick is, when you get to one of those cities,
to buy them -all- up to say 20th, and shove them in the bank.  You
don't want to have to run back and forth across the world to pick
up a spell each time you level.

Also note that there is a skill (can't recall which) that can be trained
-only- upstairs in the freeport bards guild.
