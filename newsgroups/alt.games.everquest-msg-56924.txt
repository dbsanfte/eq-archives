Are the assholes bringing level 10ish MPCs into the newbie areas
and camping the default bind points yet? They did that on Test.

I don't think it'll last on the Zeks without serious modification.
The anonymity of it draws griefers like shit draws flies. Unlike
player griefing, there are zero repercussions for showing your
ass as an MPC, other than having your MPC killed, which is not
much of a deterrent.

The MPC concept is a neat one in theory but as it stands is far
too subject to abuse to be left in production.
