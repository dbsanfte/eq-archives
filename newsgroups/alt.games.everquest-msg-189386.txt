I had problems reoccuring a while back where I would get pings of up to
4+5000 (Yes thousand) in game lasting from 2-3 minutes to 10, or LD every 10
to 30 minutes.
I tried upgrading the version (had a really old one, like dec 2000 or
something) to latest, didn't help, and downgrade to whatever version in
between that was recommended on the tech boards, didn't help either.

So I finally said enough is enough and wen't and bought myself a D-Link
router instead.
I still do get high ping bursts but only lasting 2-3 seconds and only a
couple of times per day tops.

So I am certain it is not only router but the way some packets are
transported between server and EQ client that makes routers go hickup and
temporarily block packets even with any firewall setting turned off in the
router.
Some of the FW functions are probably hardware in the routers and therefore
is allways in effect.
