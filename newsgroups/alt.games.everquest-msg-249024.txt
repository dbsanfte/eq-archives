Just out of curiosity, what'd I do to get your knickers in a knot?

Adam was busy demonstrating that he's got no idea of the difference
between accusation and insinuation and I was instructing him.
Further, he specifically asked me to explain the difference ("Explain
how you think insinuation is 'different' from accusation.").  This
offends you how?  You prefer him ignorant?

As far as I know I haven't kicked over any of your sandcastles lately,
so I don't know why you're being so bloody impolite.  So to respond
with your own lack of couth:

If I want your opinion I'll lift your rock and ask you.  Meantime,
keep your head down and your mouth shut, you smarmy little pissant.
