If you search google groups you'll find quite a large number of threads about
trials, most of them screaming about the outrageous difficulty of them.   This
pretty much stopped when trials stopped being necessary to access POV (and thru
POS, BOT), which was the attraction for lower level people without a solid guild
behind them; the vastly better exp in those zones made it attractive but the
trials made it nearly impossible for them.

There are several different trials (six I think) but 99% of people will do only
the Trial of Execution.  I've tried but never passed any of the others, probably
could now that my cleric is level 65, but there's little pushing anyone to do
so, passing -any- of them is sufficient for all purposes save getting to the
"7th Tribunal" and I've never heard of anyone clamoring to do that for anything.

Trials take place in the Plane of Justice, you make your way to the Tribunal
room, then get a group together, buff up, all go next to one of the big justice
guys and one person in the group says the trigger phrase, which will make him
transport you all to a seperate area for your trial.  Make sure you are on his
pedastle along with the rest of your group, and noone else is.  Only six players
are allowed in the seperate trial area at one time, and getting half of one
group and half of another is a sure recipee for failure.

Scheduling doesn't happen (at least I never saw it happen) what happens instead
is that there's a line, several groups sitting around waiting for their chance
to go in.  The trials are in the same zone (POJ) just in a seperate closed off
area of it, so you can communicate via OOC and so on if you like.  This is vital
because if a group fails, you can immediately trigger to go in to their room...
but will get random bounces depending on how many of them are still there; you
need to make sure the room is clear.  If a group succedes, you will have to wait
31 minutes before you can go in, so this is rarely a problem.  Most groups fail,
and average about 5 minutes per trial attempt, so if the group before you isn't
5 level 65s and a level 52, figure you'd best be getting ready when they go in.
Of course since the trials aren't necessary for tier two access anymore, you see
a lot fewer people trying them and fewer failing, so YMMV.

If you complete a trial, you get to loot a Mark off the boss mob at the end.
This item, along with some running around talking to people in POJ, will result
in a "flag" on your character (which is not an item like a key, but instead a
notation in your file that allows you access to certain planes and to getting
certain further flags)  Collect the full set and you also get flagged (I think?)
to go to the elusive 7th Hammer, whatever that may be.

Trial of Execution works like this:  Enter room, wait a minute or so, then 4
mobs pop, along with 4 "executioners"  and a prisoner (which aren't really mobs
although they look like them, they can't be targetted or interfered with).  An
executioner starts walking towards the prisoner, then says a little speech and
then kills the prisoner, and you lose the trial... unless you kill one of the
four mobs first (it takes 30 seconds for the walk and talk).  If you do, that
executioner vanishes and the second starts walking.  Kill all four mobs and you
get a short rest, then four more mobs and executioners appear.  Thats the second
wave.  Four waves in all, then the "prime executioner" appears.  If you can kill
him, then you can loot his body, it has 6 "mark of execution" on it.

There are lots more details to learn, but those are the bare minimum basics for
you anyway.
