Well in all fairness, this recent problem with EQ, IMO, is definitely
the exception rather than the rule.  The only times I remember when
there was more down time than usual was when Luclin first came out and
then recently when they upgraded to DX 9.0 (maybe some of the old
timers reading the NG might be able to let us know if there were a lot
of problems when EQ first came out).  

But otherwise, IMO, they've usually been very reliable and they
usually try to schedule the patches for off-peak hours to avoid
inconveniencing too many people.  It's a shame that this whole problem
with the login server just had to happen at the same time when you
first got the game--I can see how you wouldn't have a very good first
impression with all this!
