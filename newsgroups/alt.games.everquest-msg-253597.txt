Poking around the web a bit, I really haven't found much that talks 
about the basics.  A melee class built around 2 handed weapons and with 
lots of disciplines?

What is their role in a group, in a raid, can they solo decently? 
Should I be thinking rogue/ranger/monk or warrior/paladin/SK?

Well, I'm going to go make one just to see the first couple levels, but 
it will probably be slated for rerolling because I have no idea what 
stat to pump up and so on... unless of course its like every other class 
in the game, and I should just max out stamina

Splendid, locked out of FV for nearly 24 hours now
