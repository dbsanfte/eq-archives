This explains it. A person sending me a /tell is far more likely to
get a positive response if he's actually near me AND phrasing his
request properly, than if he's clearly just contacting someone across
the zone that he spotted on a /who druid list and pulling the 'sow
plz' routine. 

Example: buying batwings in EC near the WC zone a couple nights ago.
Monk_17 tells you, 'hi'
(someone I know?)
You told Monk_17, 'um, helllo?'
Monk_17 tells you, 'could i have sow pl z)'
(*sigh*)
You told Monk_17, 'are you near me?'
Monk_17 tells you, 'shady'
You told Monk_17, 'funny. next time, ask someone you're actually next
to.'
Monk_17 tells you, 'ok whatever'
(welcome to the schmuck list, Monk_17)
