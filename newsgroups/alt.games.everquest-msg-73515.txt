My take on the CTD issue as presented here... I had run EQ since beta on one
particular machine and it worked great up until several patches into the
Kunark expansion. Then as described in this thread it would just dump at
random. I ended up leaving eq for six months in disgust and upon returning
after Velious it again worked well for a long time. Then it started halting
or dumping at random and corrupting various eq files as one person
described. I had occasion to install XP on this particular box and it
exhibited the same symptoms. At that point I took out some of the ram and
moved some to other slots as well. This fixed the box in this case. One or
more of the DIMMS does not like the bios setup or some other addition on the
box since the old days. So in your case if you have multiple ram units try
moving them and or taking one at a time out and test to see if that stick is
fussing. None of the ones in my case turned out to be bad, they just are
finicky in this particular unit's configuration. Good luck :)
