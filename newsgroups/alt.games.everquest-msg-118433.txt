I don't know if anyone has seen this - we were in a fight and the Necro goes
LD and all the sudden the pet turns on me and starts fighing me! It
eventually poofed. Just another bad natured pet?

Stories used to be told of sorcerors who practiced the art of daemon
summoning .  Many died when they found they were not powerful enough to
control the daemon once summoned.  Maybe this is the true nature of necro
pets, coming out once control is lost.
