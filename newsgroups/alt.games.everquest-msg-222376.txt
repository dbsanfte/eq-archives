testbuff is a nice idea except its bought a lot of bad attitudes to
test.

there was someone here who posted earlier that somone was asking for
bone chips etc and when (like I do) he was told to get off his ass and
go get some himself he said "I dont have time" implying a higher lvl
character should go do it for him as their time is worth less than
his.

its also bought people to a lvl of character that they are not
necesarily familiar with. If you were going to do that, I agree, for
people with a > 60 it has a purpose I think even people on test would
say that has a point as they have proved as a whole they have put time
and effort in on test not just turned up for the phat loot.

So many people also whinned that the testbuff gear was crap. Others
whinned it was too good and was based on twinks.. Im with the its a
bit much most lvl 25s if starting from scratch would not have that
kind of equipment. If they are going to dumb down eq any more hell,
why not start them at 11, with their newbie armor quests done, and so
on..
