Hahahahahahahaha.
What did I say,just found a new game stopping bug,group of 47 to 55
wasnt able to get a Ldon,NPC says we arent of the right level range.
But disabling the petition system on the other hand was a smart move,
well done SOE.
You just totally wasted my time SOE,took me 45 minutes to build this
group,now you have 5 disgruntled customers more besides me,congrats.

I wonder when this will be fixed,maybe as fast as the map bug or after
the next expansion?
