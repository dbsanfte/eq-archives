As if stating the obvious has any value?  "WoW is going to be crowded
at first."  Well, fucking duh.

Here's a prediction for you: EQ2 will be crowded at first!  It's a
good thing I mentioned that, eh?

I'm pointing out a fact: their conclusions are premature.

I haven't parroted you, but it's a free Internet: you're free to make
up bullshit about my parroting you all you like.  Knock yourself out.

A credit card (or perhaps better said, a monthly fee) will keep a LOT
of people away.  That's damned obvious.

In other words, it's fucking self evident.  I personally know a lot of
parents that are happy to buy their kids some whiz-bang game for Xmas
but wouldn't dream of buying them a monthly subscription.  It's
fucking reality, dumbass.

Go fuck yourself, Benny.  I don't need to "prove" my history of online
gaming to you or anyone else.  If you don't believe me, fine, don't
believe me.  All that makes you is an ignorant fuck.

Whatever you say, Benny.
