I'll run my Paly "never been out of Qeynos" through there tonight to check
it out.

I'm positive I've had some bad times there, like my mid level shammy getting
attacked both in the Gorge [minotars and elder muddites] and Runneyeye on
their very first trip. Up until then, I thought the shammy had only bashed
froggies, lizards, and gnolls. I understand my other characters having a
tough time there, but the shammy is a first timer for sure.

I know you can raise faction in Gorge by killing in Runnyeye or Runnyeye by
killing in Gorge. Pretty sure there must be some other thing going on since
it was my Ogres first trip to MT.
