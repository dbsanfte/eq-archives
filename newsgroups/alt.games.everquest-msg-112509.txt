With Audigy and Win2k, I've been experimenting with the Soundfont Cache Size
on under the Options tab of the AudioHG SoundFont utlity. I increased the
cache to 32Mb. It seems to have helped, but I'm not sure if it has solved
anything yet (only got on for a few minutes since I made change). The Audigy
uses a 4mb soundfont file while SBlive uses 2Mb file. There may be other
files out there that will help as well - EQ Live Support says you MUST use
the 2 Mb version.
