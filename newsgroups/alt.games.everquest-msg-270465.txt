Patch process has been quite good actually - I have been kicked off of
trading overnight but this is the first time it has intefered with gameplay.
The majority of the patches have only taken an hour then it's game as usual.

After playing (and still playing EQ1) I am pretty amazed that the patches
have been so short, and that this is the first major stuff up.

Gives me a bit of time to read the forum and plan our next trip into
Antonica though =)
