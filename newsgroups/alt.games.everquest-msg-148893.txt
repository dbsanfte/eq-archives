You know I really hate gems. If there were only some sort of server
high score thing on it then it would make it 10 times more fun. When
you're on a MMORPG and are reduced to playing a knock off of a tetris
knock off, not to mention single player, then it is really sad. If
they added the damn high score stuff it would be a great thing but
until that time it will remain very retarded in my opinion. What would
really be something is if they could add a 2 player option or even a 4
player option that used the whole screen for when you just wanna sit
down somewhere and play some gems. Would be so sweet...
