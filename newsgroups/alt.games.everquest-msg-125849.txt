I read this that if the father refuses marrage he pays the bloke the
dowry, not that the random guy pays the father / maid.
Not exactly chile support, but does effectivly set the price for "stud"
work <G>

I'm keeping out of this one as you can read it lots of different ways.
I generally agree with Lok et. al. that so long as people read

You read sacrificeth uto any God, save the lord, as car worship ?!?
You read utterly destroyed as "doomed to hell" ?

You can read this as : If you don't worship our god we are going to
utterly destroy you. You can read it as If you perform sacrifices to
other gods you can't come to our hevean. I don't think that this is
anything about cause and effect.
