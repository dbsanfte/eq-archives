Maybe we don't have a big enough army of shamans, but if I (or anybody)
asked for PA (or even avater, offering to pay the gem cost) I'd rightly be
told where to go.  It has a huge re-cast time, and requires quite a bit of
effort for the shaman to keep it on somebody - something shamans just don't
have time to do on my guild raids

Well now you do (after the recent see invis nerf), and you always did if you
wanted priceless bows.

If were talking "usable" (i.e 1handers) then I can recall countless times
where we have uncovered zero primals - on a warders raid, when you receive
(pretty much guranteed) 5+ primals, theres a much higher chance you get
1handers.

2day, but on prexus at least, an ungodly early hour race every single time

Im not sure what the numbers are for a new-starting guild, but we can clear
ST with 1 group if we really had to, including all 3 named (most of our last
2zillion clearing have been ~2 groups)

> maybe get some 2h which would've rotted on the primary guild's raids,

Why couldn't they accompany the original guild if they alrdy have a key?
I've seen on Prexus other_guild_people tag along on raids, and score
un-needed primal (axes etc), and lots of priceless.
