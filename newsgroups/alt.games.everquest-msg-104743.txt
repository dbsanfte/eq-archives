No, it would set a precedent for suing sony/eq because they settle out
of court for lawsuits the person would never win. Reputation and
subsequent suits are  more important than court costs.

They will go to court with this and win, since by the parents own
admission they were a bad parent because they provided the support 
system for this person to continue to sponge off them and play EQ
after not having a job. Other factors such as the person's mental
problems will cinch it.

There are several reasons why these suits will never win. Foremost is
that it is a recreational activity rather than an addictive substance.
It would be compareable to someone killing themselves who watched home
shopping network all the time.
