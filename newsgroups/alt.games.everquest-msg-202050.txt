The only way I can think of to never get a title is either avoid AAs all
together or only get 5 in the first tier. Titles are determined by AA points
spent and not levels

There is a command not to display title, but I cannot remember it off the
top of my head.

Now, if you are talking about how (for example) Shadow Knights become
Reavers at 51 then those "titles" are unavoidable.
