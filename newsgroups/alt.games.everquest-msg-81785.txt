Are you insane.A fetus is a growing human being,if a fetus isn't a
human being and just some cell as you so ignorantly stated,then why
would you abort it, just let the cell mature and see what comes out.
You are one scary waste of human existence,let me tell you
(potentially) (truly pathetic) or maybe you're one of those pieces of
excrement,whose existence is the result of 2 buzzards bumping their
ass's together and you fell out.
