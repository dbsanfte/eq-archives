The tag idea would be close to impossible to implement, because of the extra database space needed.

As it work now, if you loot a rusty sword, you just get item XXX.
If you should have a tag, EVERY item in the game, NOT every item class, 
but EVERY existing item in the game should get a unique item number, and 
a reference to your player number.
This would make the database WAY too large to handle.

Same problem with trademarks on player made stuff, i would LOVE to have 
all my tailored stuff say "Made By Hesten", but would require every 
tailor made item in the game to be a unique item.
