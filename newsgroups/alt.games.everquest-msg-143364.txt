That's not the definition of hate crime, it's the reason why crimes that 
fall under that category are considered more socially disruptive than 
non-hate crimes, and carry stiffer penalties.

Er, no. If you kill your neighbour because you hate him, that's not 
necessarily a "Hate" crime. And if you kill your neighbour because he's 
Jewish, but you don't necessarily hate him (but say, you fear that your 
daughter has the hots for him), then it is a "Hate" crime.

The word "Hate" is just a catchall name for those crimes, it does not 
necessarily invoke that particular emotion.
