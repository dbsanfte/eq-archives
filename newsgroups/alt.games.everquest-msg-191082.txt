The canonical article is Emily Postnews:

http://www.faqs.org/faqs/usenet/emily-postnews/part1/

There was a time when this was posted to news.announce.newusers
and every new usenetter was pointed at it, but I haven't seen that
happening for some time.

The other things not mentioned by Emily so far as I can see:
- Don't post using HTML, because Usenet is a text medium, and many
  newsreaders show HTML as text, rendering it unreadable.
  Usenet != Email. (And many people dislike HTML in email as well -
  for a number of good reasons.) Post in plain text, with lines
  trimmed, if you can, to 70 characters or so. (*)
- Don't "top post." Top posting is including the article to which you
  are replying *after* your reply rather than before it. Top posting
  makes it very difficult to follow a conversation if you come into
  the middle of it; you would have to start near the bottom, read to
  the bottom, skip back up to just above that section to read the
  reply... it's very messy. It also makes it easy to just quote an
  entire article and essentially ignore it. Common etiquette
  (followed on every newsgroup I've seen except a handful of
  extremely Microsoft-centric ones) is to quote the article, delete
  those portions which you are not addressing, and intersperse your
  own comments just after the portions of the message to which you
  are replying.

                ...Ronny
