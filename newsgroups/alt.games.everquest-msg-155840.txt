There is no "level range" on quests. You will always get the xp
and it will always be split if grouped. I'm also not exactly sure that
with quests its based on level, it seems to be even split  but there
is a CAP for lower levels.

Crafted armor xp is QUITE large, even at level 47 and such. If you go 
with a level 9 he'd appear to get less xp but in fact he'd getting all
he could up to his cap. They made it so there is a max amount you can
get from a kill or quest, capped by level, due to powerlevel
"exploits."

Done several xp quests with people and it always seems to split if
other factors are not affecting it, such as the other or yourself
being so low you are hitting the "xp per quest item" cap.
