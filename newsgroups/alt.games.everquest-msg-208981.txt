Just trying to think of a few good zones for that:

West Karanas?  - HUGE, but the odd high level mobb might mess things
up.  Close enough to the Spires in NK though.

Qeynos Hills - Smaller zone, a city at either end to bind in

Misty Thicket - hell, you even have a wall for defence (or to denote
the combat area)

Any others?
