    In the case of Quellious, they're E-Bay'ed characters, too. But hey, as
long as the accounts are being paid for and not used to grief others, why
ban them? :-/

    More than 1 K per hour. You're going to get six money bugs per hour,
each one dropping something off the high planar gems table. Lowest value
item on that table is 130 plat rubies (do a very trivial JC combine, silver
+ any gem you get, to ensure you get full sale value for any gems that
drop), assuming you don't get crystallized sulfur. The highest value items
are over 200 plat each. So you're looking at 1 K per hour, average, from
just clearing those three bug spawns. Now add in cash and gems from frogs,
named loot (even the junky stuff like JB helm can be sold to a vendor for
333 pp), random rare drops like RBGs and ODSs, and you're starting to pull
in significant money. The best part, of course, is the money bugs - they're
your guaranteed cash.

    We have another farmer that has really started to cause problems on the
server. Asian player, former big guild member, PA seller. He's business
partner with a member of my guild, and they can multibox each other and
their small stable of characters with amazing skill (the two of them did a
three character kill on Vindi - warrior, SHM, one other second box,
including the kill). Well, they've found the best way to make consistent
money is to farm ornate armour in the Xuzl area, and when Xuzl pops, they
single-group kill him hoping to get ornate BP drops. They work on Asian
time, and they time-lock Xuzl in that time so none of the server's big
guilds can get him. Even the Australian guild has had trouble getting Xuzl
because it's hard to beat a single group that's standing within a bowshot of
the room where the mob spawns when it pops. Considering this is a
semi-needed PoP flag mob, and you can see the issue. Last patch, over 100
people from several guilds gathered and killed Xuzl on patch day before the
farmers could get to him - that's how big the backlog had become.
