No, this is central to the concept.

Zone right, med left, -whichever- zone you are in (in those limited zones
with side by side zone lines, that is)

So if you are in Dreadlands, and come screaming in with drachnids,
drolvargs, and heck, the queen of May on your tail, you jog right
coming  into the castle and zone in there.  What do you find?  A
few people medding, maybe recovering from a res, nothing to bother
you, anyway.  Want to zone back out?  Take a good hard look
across and make sure the way is clear, then waltz over to the
other zone line and pop back over.  Again (assuming everyone
is with the program) you find nothing but people medding et
al.  If that train you dragged with you is still there, its over at
the right hand zone line, probably being dealt with by someone
who had been sitting here where you zoned in.

OK, so you are sitting in the Tower, your chanter goes LD and
you have to bug out.  Toggling Run for it, I'm DA to your group,
and TRAIN including <Drovalrg Captain> to the zone, you
dash across the bridge and, faced with a choice, (drum roll)
jog right and zone.

No matter which zone you are in, if you zone right and med
left, you never train the medders, and never zone in to a
pile of someone else's train.

This is why the plan isn't zone north, med south, for example.

Sorry if you understood that, if so I misunderstood your
paragraph quoted above.  Its terrible early here, and I
haven't had my cup of burned bean elixer yet.
