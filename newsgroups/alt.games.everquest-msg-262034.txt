Did I say that? 

No I did not.

If you actually read my post I even said: "I'm not saying there should 
only be one way to engage mobs in EQ" which is pretty much the opposite 
of what you apparently think I said.

> but... I for one am glad there are more than a few ways to kill mobs.

Me too.

I have no problem with conventional groups (MT), root aggro, root rot, 
ae groups, fear kiting, quadkiting, arrowkiting, bard chant and swarm 
kiting. In each of those cases the ai is doing a 'reasonable' job. It 
may not be whacking on the most logical target (ie its not always taking 
out the cleric or echanter first), but at least its whacking somebody. 
In the cases its not whacking anybody, its because it can't (feared 
(loss of control) or perpetually out of range of *any* target).

I think aggro kiting is lame. The mob is doing absolutely nothing useful 
with respect to inflicting damage and/or preserving its own life, and 
the mob *could* be doing something useful... by whacking one of the 
people at point blank range instead of wasting its time uselessly 
chasing a character it will never reach.

See the difference?

> in my opinion the only lame ways are those with zero risk

Lol. *Most* xp groups I've been in are pretty near zero risk in my book.
