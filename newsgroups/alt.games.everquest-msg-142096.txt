You got it perfectly backwards. All the money you make belongs to the 
State. You are allowed to keep a large percentage of it so you can spend 
it on keeping the wheels of the economy turning, consuming products so 
that other people can have jobs and draw salaries too. The rest of it 
the State wants back immediately, so it can be plowed into public 
services. It's the social contract.

What? Enormous natural resources and a strong work ethic? Neither of 
those is going anywhere (although it could be argued that work ethic is 
not what it used to be, it's my experience that those people who work, 
work longer hours now than before), and neither of those is unique. The 
combination of those is what is quite rare, and what made the US wealthy.

Of course. Because it has been tried, found wanting, and discarded. Same 
as Communism, in fact.

As far as that society being better than any other... sure, as long as 
you don't have children, or else think that working in the coal mines 
from the age of six builds character.

Thanks, Hughes... Every now and then it takes a post like yours to 
remind me why I'm a socialist.
