Actually, most modern style guides are now suggesting a single space after
sentences and colons.  This is because most word processing is not done with
variable pitch fonts on computers, so there is no need for the double space.
As you can see, I cannot seem to break the habit.  I guess I wouldn't expect
older teachers to change their ways, either.

While whitespace is a basic style item, it is, in fact, called out in most
of the netiquette articles I've seen.

Cheers,
