I know I have posted a couple times on here and both times, maybe 3?, have
been whines about happenings in the game. Welp, got another one.

Last nite on the Drinal server in Estate of the UnRest i had 2 floors of the
complex camped, bout 1 room each and easily covered by sitting on the stairs
so no one would take them.  I had been in there for a little over an hour
when someone asked me to sow/boff them down stairs so I did.  I come back
after answering another person that the "bar room" and "top floor" were
taken only find that same person taking out BOTH rooms.  Now when I was
talking to them, which I would love to talk to thier guild, they became very
biligerant towards me.  Is this a higher level character thing? Just because
they are a higher level character they are allowed to walk over people as if
they are GOD? Then, not more then an HOUR later, another character came in
while i was in the midst of hitting a ghoul with fire arrows and had them
down to 78% damage, he comes in hits him twice, drops the ghoul dead and
then tells me i'm being the crybaby for HIM stealing my kill.  Lots of folks
wondered why I left HighKeep, this is the reason i'll be leaving unrest as
well.  Don't people understand when you camp something it means your waiting
for more monsters to spawn to get more EXP or Loot?

I guess, first off, how do I go about filing a complaint with the ones guild
and second how can I get the later one to back off and leave my kills alone.
