LOL!  Yup, and it was up hill, both ways...  and we only had one pair of
tattered boots to last us the whole year...  Snow up to our eyeballs...  (well
ok, if you were born in Halas anyway) and dangerous critters around every
corner...

I'm loving where this thread is going!  :o)  I see I'm not the only one who had
to grow up listening to 'Joshua Stories' as my family called them...  hehe  My
Dad actually used to pull that whole "I had to walk 5 miles to school, each
way... blah blah" until such time that I was old enough to understand
distance...  Then, we were visiting the little town in Southern Illinois where
he grew up and he took me to the spot where his childhood home had once stood
(it had been destroyed by fire sometime in the late 60's) and from there he
drove (LITERALLY) 2 blocks around the corner to where he went to school... 
Nice try Pops.  hehe

What on EARTH are we going to tell our own children?  "When I was your age, we
only had BASIC cable..."  "You don't know how good you have it!  When I was
your age, we didn't have all this Playstation, XBox crap... we had an Atari and
we were damn lucky to have that!"

LMBO!  Of course, I'm 38, so I actually didn't even have cable or Atari as a
kid.  Those didn't come about til I was in my early High School days...  hehe
