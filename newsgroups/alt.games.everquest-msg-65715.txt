We are currently aware of the Installation and Technical problems that
are occurring with the new Shadows of Luclin expansion and the update to

the existing EverQuest game client. Listed below are some fixes for most

of the installation and technical problems. If you are still having
problems, after following all of these steps, please refer to the bottom

of the page, where it has detailed instructions on the files that we
require to further troubleshoot your problem.


Direct X and Video Card driver information.

Due to the upgrade of the existing game client, EverQuest now requires
that you have Direct X 8.1 installed. This is REQUIRED to be installed
or you will not be able to run the EverQuest game client. You may
download Direct X 8.1 from the following link:

http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp

This download is for Windows 98/ME/2000/XP operating systems.

Due to the fact that Windows 95 does not support Direct X 8.1, we can no

longer offer support for the Windows 95 system.  In order to play
EverQuest, Windows 95 users will need to upgrade their operating system
to Windows 98 or greater.


EverQuest also requires the latest video card drivers for your system.
Please visit the following link for the list of drivers specific to your

card:

http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/compatability_matrix.jsp

The cards listed there are the only video cards supported by EverQuest.
Any cards not listed there have not been tested and we can not offer
support for them.
