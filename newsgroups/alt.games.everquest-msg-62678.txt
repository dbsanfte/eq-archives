Nope...they're saved server side only.

I want you to seriously think on this...if there were such a
client-side file, do you not think that the folks coding ShowEQ,
the EQ emulator, and all of the various other hacks and hack
attempts wouldn't have found it already?

And it's easy to mess with the client side stuff anyway.
Wearing a Sebilite Scale BP, my alt rogue looks like she's
in banded. If I use my Iksar mask, re-equip the Seb BP/boots
she's in, and then cancel the illusion...viola! Instant mithril
looking BP and boots.  The "save" doesn't save my graphics
like that, because if I  zone or change form to DE, I would
have to do it over again.

Also, get your friend to hand you his Ubersword of Godslaying
and have the server crash before the save comes through. There's
a good chance you'll no longer be holding the UoG. If the server
doesn't get  the information, it never happened.
