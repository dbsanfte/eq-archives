My apologies: I thought you said that was what you were doing. You mentioned
you were there for loot. I guess I missed where you mentioned experience.
Sorry for harshing on you undeservedly.

In that case, toss most of what I said aside. You were under no cumpunction
to vacate when someone else came along. It doesn't sound like the other
fellows did anything wrong, either, though.
