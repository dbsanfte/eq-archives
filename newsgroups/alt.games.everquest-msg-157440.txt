The "Kaladim" port is actually out in BB away from the dorf guards, I'd be
surprised if the evil city ports were in dangerous spots.

Personally, I'd like it better that way, actually, like the Firepots
ports... which put you in a safe spot but you still had to have some way
out of the spot they put you in.

I'd also appreciate it if they would move the Kaladim port to the temple,
since thats where my faithstone takes me.  At the moment I have to click
to kaladim, zone to other half of kaladim, zone out to bb... what a pain.
Oh wait, you people who can't faithstone or gate should not read this
paragraph. or you'll have the irresistable desire to pick up Fnord's Tiny
Violin of False Sympathy
