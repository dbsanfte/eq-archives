Actually, it would be pretty easy for that to be overpowered. If 2HS
does as much or more damage than 1HS, but still taunts a lot less, then
a warrior using the currently little used offensive disciple will be an
awesome damage dealer.

If they can do within 10% of the damage of a rogue, but without any
chance of failing evade, without the mob being required to be moved into
position, and with much higher survivability to ripostes and AoE damage,
then uber guilds will likely go to having 20 warriors, 10 clerics and
token members of all other classes for buffing.
