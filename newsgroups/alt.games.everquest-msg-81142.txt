Your stuff sounds pretty good, though you seem to have sacrificed some AC
for stats. My Level 25 ranger was wearing full banded until he managed to
pick up a lumberjack cap for 40plat a few days ago. It is 10ac and +3
stamina. I would would be vary wary about choosing a lesser AC armour item
to gain a few stats though - I have noticed my own Ranger takes quite a
pounding as is.

Weapons are just a couple of 8/28 Velium 1HS Battleaxes which after 12
levels of trusted service I finally managed to proc : )  The pair of these
set me back 25plat but your weapons sound very nice. On practice sessions I
use a forged spear (1hs) and a Ye Olde Ball Pein Hammer (1hb) which are
pretty lousy but I choose easy blues for skill gaining sessions, all my main
fighting is dual weilding the axes.

Rings are a pair of the same dex/ac cutthrout insignias your have and
earings are also a pair of the agi Onyx ones you use also : ) Neck slot I
use banded and would be loathe to sacrifice this AC, even for the good stat
item you use in the neck slot. I haven't started working on any of the
2handed skills yet - but am keeping a eye on the auction channel for a cheap
and quick 2hs for use in practice sessions as this is starting to concern
me. Currently only have 55plat in the bank as fletching keeps me broke so it
would have to be a bargain for me to get anything.

All in all, my gear doesn't worry me yet, and I solo without exception. Once
I hit 30 and get sow I might think about moving to indoors to RunnyEye
Citadel for the Blackened Alloy Armour. If I am pretty lucky I will also
pick up some Blackened Iron Longswords as well. This stuff ain't "l33t" but
it's good enough for me and pretty dang light : )
