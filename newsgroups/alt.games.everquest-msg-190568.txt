Interesting, not good that station store doesn't have it.  Have you tried
EBgames?  Sometimes ToysRUs has games but I haven't bought any EQ from them,
not sure of availability there.  I've seen EQ at BestBuy, Wal-mart, and
Target also.
Don't waste your money on the Prima books they'll try to sell you.  The only
halfway decent one is the Ruins of Kunark one and even that one is woefully
inadequate now.
