Just an interesting note....

While living in exile in Everfrost, I've spent some of my time hunting
bears.  My character on Sullon Zek now has 8 HQ Bear skins/pelts in the
bank.  That's twice as many as all of my other characters on all the other
servers combined have ever had.  I seem to be noticing a lot more of them in
/auction in EF on SZ as well.

Has anyone noticed an increase in the amount of HQ Bear skins dropping in
Everfrost on other servers?  Or is this just a Sullon Zek thing?  (or have I
suddenly become very lucky?)
