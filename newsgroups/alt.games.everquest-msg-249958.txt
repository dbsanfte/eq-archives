And how much pp you have isn't integral to the game being played in
anything other than what you can buy with it. The fact is that the
game since day 1 was structured using a monetary system. You could
farm material, sell it for plat.. and in turn buy stuff with that
plat. Those are the rules of the game and the only thing that is being
suggested is adding one more way of accumulating plat or items using
expendable goods that have to also be worked for. That being RL money.
You just want to look over at the other guy and wonder why he gets
items you can't when you can't afford it. Jealousy is still one of the
seven deadly sins the last I checked. Stop worrying about how much
money or items the other guy has.. that isn't the point.. simply
experience the content, kill as much stuff as you can with your guild,
advance your character as far as you can, and have fun.

As I've said before.. i'm opposed to SoE doing in-game item sales if
it means auto-generating items to do it. That includes platinum sales.
If they want to sell it, they can farm it.

The difference is that the point of monopoly is to accumulate the most
wealth from a static starting point.. $1500 game money. He with the
most cash and assets at the end wins the game.. the game is over. In
Everquest, a world is built that players can access.. having the most
plat in-game doesn't win it, you are expected to accumulate goods
while you play in order to make your character better, and the point
of the game is to take on increasingly tougher challenges for gear you
cannot sell and to clear up through the toughest monster dropping the
best non-sellable loot in the game. To try to claim these two games
are even remotely similar is a stretch and only done using a very
small subset of Everquest. The economy is meant to circulate items and
material around to the players that need them... not be the entire
point of the game. A healthy economy only helps the new player most of
all because no longer do they have to work as hard as they did to get
the items they need to play this game. As such... things that took a
year.. two years to accomplish can now be done in months or even
weeks.

You keep trying to equate Monopoly with Everquest.. and the two games
couldn't be more different, both in structure and in play. So while
the analogies are certainly cute, and they brought a smile to my
face.. its just an apples and oranges scenario.
