Not really - usually, while learning the skill, new players can't
afford the stuff you make and/or the return isn't sufficient for the
time spent hunting for pelts and buying patterns.  You can try and do
a conversion service, making pelts up into armour for players who have
them, then charge a fee, but it's not worth the effort.

I gave away all the armour I made while learning to make my own Silk
armour...  

I made more SELLING pelts to other players who are Tailors than I ever
have by actually tailoring  :D  For example, and talking from personal
experience, a HQ Bear pelt can go for 50pp in auction, and HQ Cat
pelts can go for 5pp each.  Via this method, I have a lvl 16
Necromancer (Tailoring at a mere 25) who can make 200pp or more about
once per week, after building up stocks of pelts. This is MUCH more
than I would make selling home-made armour  to people  :)

I am now tending to think skills are a waste of time...  I could be
mistaken though, so why not give it a try?  You only need a lvl 1 in
the skill, and then it's just practice, practice...  :)
