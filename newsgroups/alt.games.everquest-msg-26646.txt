There's your first clue. You have nothing they want. You don't buff and 
you're not really high enough that they think there's anything good on 
you.  I am still a bit surprised that you haven't been hit up. Try it 
just after you died and are naked and see how you feel.

Maybe and maybe not. Rathe is an older server, but so is Drinal (with 
the split). I DO NOT believe it is true newbies that are the worst 
beggars. I've counseled many on the subject and they seem to agree (they 
don't want to be bothered in that way once they get to that level) and 
will generally work for you to get something they need. The 'beggar 
noobs' are probably an alt made specifically to beg.

Lucky you.. good anti-beggar character choices.

Not necessarily the case. I have a 30 druid and a 21 shaman. I have 
NEVER turned down a request for buffs. I think there is a line in there 
somewhere. Ask me for buffs and sow when I'm just standing around then 
fine. Ask me for buffs or sow while fighting and I tend to think you're 
a blithering idiot. I once had one guy nuke the beastie I was fighting 
just so I would be finished and sow him. THAT is rude. So I gave him a 
/rude and ran off. Begging for pp/items is also VERY rude. I WENT AND 
EARNED WHAT I HAVE!!! Why should YOU be entitled to the fruits of MY 
work?? As the old saying goes, "Ass, grass or gas. NO ONE RIDES FOR 
FREE!"

> when a simple sow would have been a god send but im not allowed to ask right?
No one said you couldn't ask. Getting it usually depends on HOW you ask.

Very noble of you. And I suspect the VAST majority of players would do 
the EXACT same thing. How much PP do you earn on an average night? Do 
YOU think they should receive any of that? Did THEY help you kill 
anything to receive that cash? Did THEY risk their life? No so I doubt 
that they are entitled to a damn thing.

> characters behind which sits another guy, so why shun the whole community thing

I haven't heard anyone say that. But you hit it on the head. FAVOR. 
DON'T expect it.

> earn a sow? dance a scottish jig? and i like to earn my shit, when a guy in our
Has someone actually SAID that to you? As I said I (or the majority of 
players out there) won't turn down a sow request if it is given with 
respect. "Might I have a Sow, please?" Will (9 times out of 10) get you 
the sow. In my case it would also get you more buffs than you can use. 
Ask "dewd sow plz" and you'll get a /rude ignore from me. The way I see 
it it's a matter of respect. I picked a class that has those attributes 
and worked my ASS off to get them. I'm sure you did with your necro or 
paladin.

I see no problem with taking something someone offers. Your guildie was 
very nice in doing that. Personally I would have taken it and worked to 
get my own and handed one down to another in the guild. That's just me.

To sum up. YES. Yes it is as bad as we say. I personally have not played 
my druid in 1 1/2 years now. I'm permanantly stuck at 30. Am I bitter? 
Maybe, but after numerous tells for sow or ports, I'm just kinda sick of 
dealing with it. Sure, I can be anon... but why should I HAVE to? 
a_dewd_00 says, "dood tp plz". My response, "Toilet paper is in the 
bathroom. I don't deliver."
