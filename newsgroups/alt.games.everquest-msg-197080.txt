Don't you think it is?  And the reverse (punishing others is a reward
to you) seems widespread as well, or are the claims that the big Monk
nerf was a response to loudly voiced class-envy complaints just some
more hot air?  What about those Wizards and Druids who complained that
they ought to be compensated because now everybody else could move
around almost as easily as they could?  Hell, how about all the whining
when that 65 Warrior got awarded a Blade of War (or whatever it's
called) for helping out at a fan fair?
