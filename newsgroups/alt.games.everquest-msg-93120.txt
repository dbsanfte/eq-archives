    Ayup. Also, if there's been a castle train, some of the mobs can get
"stuck" around the corner of the zone-out and they won't path back home. You
can pull them back out by having someone at frenzy-level health fight a
spider right in front of the zone, but that usually turns out poorly for
everyone involved - it did the last time we tried to fish Tpos out of there.
:-) Really, if the four gargoyles aren't up you should be happy. The
Sentinels behind them are easier and one of them can spawn as a named
(Keredelb or something like that?).
