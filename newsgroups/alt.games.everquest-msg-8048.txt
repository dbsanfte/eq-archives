Well, it's really easy  to get to the merchant...Nothing in SolA can see
past invis (on the way to the gnome at least...I have never really explored
this zone),
so just get an invis at zone, find a good map (eqatlas has one) and you
should be fine. To go back, since Invis will have drop just run  ). you
won't be encumbred and the zone is close enough.
But, since you're a Iksar and unless you've been fighting in SolB or
someother place that give gnomish faction, you won't have enough faction to
be able to buy from the merchant.
So you'll have to work on it (killing dog in SolB).
By the way, 5250pp is with a 105 char min and a decent faction (Price with
my dwar rogue with
83 char and kindly faction : 5850pp)


good luck
