A friend asked me today where he should hunt with his lvl 9 or 10 Paladin 
- of Froglok type.

I coulda told him (and did, to some extent) where he could do the XP 
grind, but he wants "good loot" as well.  Could SOMEONE tell me what to 
tell him (other than GoToHell) insofar as the "best" place to hunt is, 
either solo or grouped, given his need for both XP and coin?

Hell, just some GENERAL places to look into would be good enough.  I just 
don't want to hear him complain that it's taking forever or not getting 
enough money.  

Flame if ya want, I don't care.
