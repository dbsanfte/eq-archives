This happened twice, I can't remember the first zone, but it was 
different from the second, which was POFire.

I wiped my ini files on my desktop, and not on the laptop, so I'll be 
able to compare that way.  This solution worked, although it was 
brutal... and its introduced a new annoyance.

The AA for the SK pet has gone missing.  Abyssal Steed is still there, 
but Unholy Steed, which is the one I have, isn't to be found anywhere. 
I asked a couple guildmates, and the AA is gone from their lists too.

So, now I need to go digging in the Ini file until I find at least the 
line for my pony!
