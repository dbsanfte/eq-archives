Why hide the information? What is the point? Are they afraid that
people might start to notice a decline in server population when Dark
Ages of Camelot comes out and that it would have a snowball effect? Or
perhaps they are already starting to lose accounts and don't want
people to notice. It's a shady and completely unnecessary change.
We're paying $10 a month for bug fixes, not to have information that
has been available for over 2 years hidden from us like we are
children.
