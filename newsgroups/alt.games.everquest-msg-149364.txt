My instant choice would be:
 HASTE ITEM - Spend most of your cash here
 Decent Weapons - A CoT is like 300 plat on my server, and still serves me 
well at 44. Make sure to get at least a good 1hb, a decent HTH (Polished 
Steel Ulak perhaps) and a 2hb to train with (I learned on a bamboo bo 
stick, cheap and only 20 delay)
 Armor - Spend the rest of your cash on armor- Wu's is the default, if you 
havce a fair chunk try to pick up some Spider Fur stuff as well (cloak 
first)
 
Also, you may already have HP, AC, STA jewelry on other characters... 
Reclaim that.
