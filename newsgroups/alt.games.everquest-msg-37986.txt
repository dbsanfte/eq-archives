You should buy some enchanted jewelry: silver jasper rings,
electrum/gold jasper earrings, electrum/gold jade bracers.

Most of the other good stuff won't become available to you without
buying until you get around 30-ish and beyond and can take a group and
camp the spawns. Around 25-ish you could hunt the evil eyes in
Beholder's Maze and try for some polished bone bracers.

You could also do the Investigator's Badge quest in Qeynos with some
friends; the reward will give a paltry +1 wis, but it's better than
nothing I suppose.
