My hot key is two lines:

/assist <MA> (by name)
/say Assisting with %T

By assisting the MA by name, I don't have to worry about
targeting him (or her) before the fight and all that.  I just
click the button and go.  I know the second line is unnecessary,
but I like to include it to let people know I am in the fight
and, more importantly, to remind the rest of the group to use
/assist.  I know it should be, and probably is, unnecessary to
remind people, but it can't hurt, right?

PD
