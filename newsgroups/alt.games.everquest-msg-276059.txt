Yes.  Basically in buyer mode, you search for item you want or need
(for example Minor Muramite Rune), set the amount and/or items you
will trade for the rune (for example, a regular Muramite rune plus
5Kpp) and then sit there for someone who has Minor Muramite rune and
wants either the regular and/or 5Kpp.

This could be of great use to bazaar seller who has been holding
certain item for far too long and just want to get rid of it or
someone who doesn't want to set up a trader or don't have time.

The barter search is a bit wonky and there's no easy way to find out
if you have something that someone wants. =p Hand searching each buyer
is the only easy way to find out at this time.
