This may not be the Holy Grail of all mission or quest based MMOGs but it's
damned close. I've always wanted a game that gave me specific missions
tailored to my class and took full advantage of my class and challenged my
abilities *as that class*. None has ever delivered. Star Wars Galaxies
hinted at it with profession-specific missions, but these were a joke and
ultimately the crafting missions that my Weaponsmith received were generic
fedex missions that involved taking some crafting component from one place
to another, and *maybe* doing a combine along the way. Bleh.

Any game that successfully implements this kind of system would be very
popular, I would think. Imagine the Rogue mission described above, with
appropriate rewards for experience and loot at the conclusion of the
mission. I'd love to see this kind of thing.
