I'm curious as to how you came to rate the Vindi BP the best warrior
BP in game. We don't even give it to warriors. We give it to shamans,
bards, shadowknights, and paladins. Warriors would seem to rate the
Skyshrine BP, Kael BP, Breastplate of Eradication, and Warmaster's
Ribcage all superior to Vindi.
