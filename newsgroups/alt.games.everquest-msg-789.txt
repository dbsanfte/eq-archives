what area are you in?  Sometimes just keeping an eye out for people who are
alone, or those shouting for a group is good . .ask them if they would like
to team up with you, or help you form a group to hunt wandering spawns
(those big spiders in north desert of Ro come to mind)  With the characters
I normally play, I find it almost impossible to join an existing group at a
"camp"  unless I go over and ask if I can join if they have room later

It seems to me that a lot of lower level players do not understand the role
a monk should play in a full group.  My monk is also level 7 (also having
problems finding groups)  Sometimes when I can get him in a group, he gets
referred to as the tank.  Then he dies hehe.  I have been in higher level
groups with my shaman with monks who get put as tank, and I use tons of mana
healing them.  A monk is good at dealing a lot of melee damage, just not as
good at taking it.  The thing is, what will get you back into a group isn't
so much your class, but how you play your class.  Learning good grouping
skills, being polite, sometimes roleplaying . . . those are things that will
make lasting impressions :)


I actually have a pad of paper where I keep track of who I group with . .
.has a few big red x's where people have been mean or horrible (like the
group that, after my bard was killed after she explained she couldnt tank,
left for another zone . . .even though I told them I didnt have a clue how
to get where my body was)

I wish you good hunting!
