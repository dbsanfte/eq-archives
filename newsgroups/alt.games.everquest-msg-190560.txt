When most people are two-boxing, I think one character stays stationary in a
safe spot in the zone.  The PLee then either sets out to kill monsters,
periodically returning to the PLer for buffs and heals or pulls monsters to
the PLer for assistance in the kill.  Pally HP/AC buffs should be better
than the Cleric's so those can help, but beyond that I'm not sure how to
make the combo work.  You might want to set your Cleric up in a safe place
and have the Pally pull to him.  Once the Cleric has done 51% damage to the
mob, the Pally can finish the job.  The Pally blinding the monster during
the fight might also help the Cleric take less damage.  The Pally can help
with healing.  I'm not sure if this can be done, but if the Paladin can get
enough aggro and stand beside the Cleric maybe the monster will attack the
Paladin (who is not attacking but acting as a damage sponge) instead of the
Cleric.  That sounds like a longshot, though.


Question:  Why are you bringing up a cleric to assist your Pally?  It seems
like a shaman would overall provide a better range of capabilities -
particularly SoW and Slow.
