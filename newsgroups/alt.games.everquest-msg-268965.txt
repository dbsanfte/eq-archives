They are all copies of the same zone.   Whenever there are too many players in
the existing copies of the zone, a new copy will be created that people can
now enter.   Similarly, if the zone population drops too much, the instance
will stop accepting new players, at which point it will die when the last one
there leaves.   If the amount of players starts to recover in the active
versions of the zone, the one that was closing due to lack of players will be
reopened.

Because there is no way to tell how long an instance has been opened, or how
many have come and gone since it started, any of them may be the "least
crowded" version.   Only way to tell is to zone in, do /who and if it is too
crowded try another copy of the zone.  (zone out and come back selecting a
different number.)
