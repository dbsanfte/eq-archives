The run from Qeynos to Freeport is one of my earlier exciting
memories.

Dont ever recall Fear being open to level 1's. Infact on day 1, there
was no Plane of fear OR hate. They came shortly after release.

I dont know if its this way now, but if you died on a boat, when the
boat took off, it would dump your body somewhere unknown in the ocean.
I can recall getting off on Erud's Isle, getting in deep doo-doo then
running back to the boat only to croak. Then the adventure started
trying to find where my body had sunk to.

I also recall there not being a /surname command. I remember guides
would advertise that they would be at a specific spot to give out
surnames if you were level 20+.

I can recall that weather had much more of a blinding effect than it
does now and the relief when they upped the clipping it would produce.
(why I remember that I have no clue)

There were no loot messages. You never knew what people were REALLY
looting.

Is there somewhere that lists all the old patch messages? Would be
interesting to browse.

It would be kind of nostalgic if for their 5th anniversary if they put
up a server that was just like at release. But this would require the
old client, so its not going to happen =/.
