It's not just druids, it's all tracking classes.  You can track a corpse 
of a groupmate IF the groupmate died while grouped, is not in the zone, 
and you haven't zoned or regrouped since they died.  
If you change groups, zone, camp, succor, or just about anything else it 
will no longer work.  It will not work once the dead groupmate zones back 
in.

The locate corpse spell/song is a different beast entirely.  As a bard I'm 
the only class that can both track and locate corpse, so it's fairly easy 
to find corpse of groupmates.  Locate corpse generally only works if you 
have the person whose corpse you're seeking targetted.  (There is a 
work-around on this, but it's very hit-or-miss.)
