I've been hunting the guards in Felwithe with my Iksar monk.  I had my
Barbarian shaman for buffs (so as not to hurt his faction)  Since the
Barbarian gains exp faster (race penalty) after he dinged, I degrouped
to let the exp go to my Iksar.  
I've heard that if you retain the group and move the members far
enough apart that you retain the group bonus without sharing.  Has
anyone tried this?
One other thing, it seemed to me that even though all the buffs were
the same, I took 15 to 25 percent more damage each fight when I wasn't
grouped.  Is is possible that even though one member wasn't fighting,
they figured in the fight calculations?  Maybe just enough to cause a
delay?  

Qiset.
Bank of America defines chintzy IMHO.  
Email for details.
