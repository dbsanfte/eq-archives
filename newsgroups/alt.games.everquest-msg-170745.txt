Perhaps.  But as soon as I started having LD problems,  I stopped buying 
any serious buffs for my chars.  And when it continued, and I died 
multiple times from LD, I quit playing my soloing chars.  I miss her, 
and I sure wish I could bring her out, but until this is either fixed or 
I can afford a new ISP, I'm not even considering bringing her out again.  
Seems kind of silly to die that many times and still stubbornly hang 
onto the habit of getting a KEI each and every time.
