My apologies to you...I lashed out in a way that I shouldn't have...

I would tell you my story today of what my family was put through...but that
would only give this asshole more ammo in which to fire at me...

I'm very angry...I'm venting...you'll have to excuse my outburst.

I guess this idiot failed to realize that this wasn't just an attack on
America...it was an attack on the free world. They didn't call it the World
Trade Center for nothing...
