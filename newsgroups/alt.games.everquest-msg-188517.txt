Seriously, it prolly needed to be said as there have been some posts asking
how to make money recently that may not have received much in the way of
useful replies.
You have to understand that it is not a conspiracy of silence, just that
most of us were there so long ago we no longer think about the tricks of
making money at starter levels. Besides, they have it so much easier now
than we did...make them suffer a little ;ï¿½P
