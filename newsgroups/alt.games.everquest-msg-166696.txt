On my server (Druzzil), the geonids have always been considered a one
person/group camp.  Sometimes a soloer will sit at the very top and just do
the one spawn there, but it's usually a respected camp.  When I was there on
my monk around level 48ish, it took me 10 mins to do the whole run,
bandaging and all, and it's a 13 min respawn so I had to wait a couple of
minutes afterwards.  I could see sharing it with a soloer, since the exp is
so good, but trying to share with a group is going to leave both of you with
nothing to kill.
