Okay, step by step....

Create a HotKey for Sense Heading (for instance in the 1 position) and a
HotKey for Forage (for instance the 2 position).

Next go into keyboard settings and whatever key you have as your left and
right (don't use forward and back since you tend to hold those and not press
them over and over)....anyway, say you have A as your Left and D as your
Right (which I do, lets me space my hands better, and I'm used to Quake
style).  Under User Defined 1 give it the keystroke A, and under user
defined 2 give it the stroke D.  In EQ if you have a key doing two different
things it will do both if possible whenever you press said key.

This is honestly the best "trick" I have found in the game.  My sense
heading went from 12 to 68 or so in about a day of wandering around, and is
now at the max for my level and goes up the next five each level.  Foraging
I did later in game and is only at 30.  Kind of fun though walking around
and randomly having food show up on your cursor.  Sense heading will work
during battle but forage won't, so hit the left key, or whatever you have on
Sense Heading every couple of seconds.  Makes walking around large zones
easier to since you will always see what direction you are heading as you
walk around anyway.

Only caveat, I have noticed a very slight slow down doing this, just cause
the processor has to deal with a random die role every time you press it,
but my comp is fast enough to handle it.  If yours is, do it, trust me
you'll love it.
