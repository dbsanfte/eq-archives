So, as per usual, "policy" is in the eye of the GM.  In your case, the
GM went out of his way to arrange that he could clear your original GLs
"guild owner" status, while the guy I knew couldn't even get his "guild
owner" status cleared when the guild he "owned" was already gone.  Might
be a question of timing too, this occurred right after that first guild
wipe, when VI was actively trying to reduce the size of the guild
database, probably not the best time to be looking for special treatment
in that regard.
