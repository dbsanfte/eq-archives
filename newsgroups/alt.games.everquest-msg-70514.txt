I think its just after patch delusions.

A friend of mine swore up and down that his tboots speed had been nerfed.
I had done some speed timing of sow and jboots/tboots speed a while ago
(before luclin) So I ran the same tests again. Still the same speed.

I think the speed thing is due to perception of the frame rate of the
new graphics engine.

However, there was one day where I logged in and everything was 3 times faster
for me, animations, sounds, combat, I mean everything. I logged out and back
in after a patch and it was back to normal. Wierdest thing I ever saw in the game.
So there may still be bugs and optimizations left to do.
