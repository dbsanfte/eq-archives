I think it also might depend on how much you're carrying.  Once my
enchanter got stuck in the water at the back of Akanon and had an
awful time getting out.  I realized later that I was carrying a few
of those metal box things the clockworks drop.  Each one weighs
something like ten stones.  I don't think I was actually encumbered,
though.  I tried it again carrying nothing and it was much easier
to get out of the water.
