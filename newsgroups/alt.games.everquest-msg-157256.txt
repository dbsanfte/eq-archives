}"placeholderS"
}Don't focus on *what* the mobs are.

I really don't care if it's plural or not, I just want a way to tell if 
it's the thing(s) I'm supposed to kill, or a distraction from the thing(s)
I'm supposed to kill if I want quillmane to spawn.

Especially since understanding Quillmane's cycle might help me find a few 
other mobs I've been looking for since time immemorial, like Grizzleknot.  
and those named gnolls.  If I have one group of mobs I know share a cycle, 
and another group not on that cycle, I can stop worrying about whether 
Phido is keeping live Lord Grimrot from spawning.  But clearly, someone 
thinks it's much more important that every mage everywhere spend 8 months 
trying to figure out how to kill a stupid horse, than it is for people to 
share information and actually make the game more interesting for 
everyone.
