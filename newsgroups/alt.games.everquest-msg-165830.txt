Like i said, its a shame.

Guess what..  a NAKED BARD has tanked nToV.

I've seen rangers tank Tormy, Narandi etc, so don't give me that shit about
"monks made me sick".  It was a side effect of all well-equipped melee
classes.

I've seen a rogue tank ST named/dragons,  HoT and Doze.

But monks made you sick, right?

What exactly did monks tank that was so far ahead of the others?
Considering we a) have no spells/utilities like a ranger   b) don't dish
damage like a rogue
