Best way it ghetto selling in the bazaar. A druid is best suited for
this, really, once it can port.

What you do is you go around to npc vendors in obvious areas, like the
commons, buying all low, high, medium quality bear/wolf/cat skins and
all spiderling/spider silk. You also will sometimes see other obvious
money makers as well bone chips, windstones, etc. I saw two windstones
on an npc vendor for 16 plat each which I sold in the bazaar pretty
fast at 80 plat each (the lowest price other people in the bazaar had
them at was 255 plat, but I am only out for fast vendor profit and its
all profit to me) 

You can vendor delve for these items if all trader spots are full,
since more are shown now you only have to delve as many as 9 spots I
think. What you do is buy out slots of stacked and cheap or just cheap
player sold items you see on the npc vendor. Then you refresh the
vendor (exit and right click again) The slots you emptied will now
have things in them. Its worth doing when you are around vendors you
are pretty sure would have the items you are looking for, but are
currently full of other junk.

An alternative is only buying the stuff you see, but you'll miss a
lot. I've been doing this a bit after the recent patches and still am
getting quite the haul, though. I'll clear 1 k or more a night just
running around to various npcs vendors here and there. You'd never get
277 bone chips as quickly actually killing skeletons anywhere.

Here are some examples from a bazaar log:

-----------------------------

That was all while AFK.

Bone chips are sold on npc vendors for like 1 silver 4 copper. I
usually get about 257 of them then sell them for 2 or 3 gold each in
the bazaar (depending on the prices of others, I always make sure my
price is lowest, unless the price I match only has like 10 bone chips)

Hides are usually around 4 gold on npc vendors, so once again its all
profit. Spider and spiderling silk are a couple gold, so if you sell
them at a couple plat its big profit.

I supplement this stuff with the seawind necklace you see, sold for
400 plat. Jasmine(bard factions) or something in a bar at the east
freeport dock has a quest for this, in LOY,  but the nice thing is she
always has it when you kill her also. She is fairly low level and will
be spawned again by the time you give the item to your bazaar vendor
then gate down again.
Fools try to sell this for 1500 plat, you'll see it on them forever
while I sell 2 or 3 of them in the same length of time for 300 - 400
plat each. If it hasn't sold next time I check at 400, it drops to
350, etc. Then if next time I check its sold I put another on the
vendor.
I made 5k plat in a couple days mostly doing that, as well as selling
npc vendor junk here and there. I thought the last couple patches
might have made her no longer drop the seawind, but she still does.

purchased 1 Seawind Necklace for ( 400p).
purchased 1 Seawind Necklace for ( 400p).
purchased 1 Seawind Necklace for ( 400p).
purchased 1 Seawind Necklace for ( 500p).
purchased 1 Seawind Necklace for ( 500p).
purchased 1 Seawind Necklace for ( 500p).
purchased 1 Seawind Necklace for ( 400p).
purchased 1 Seawind Necklace for ( 400p).
purchased 1 Seawind Necklace for ( 400p).
purchased 1 Seawind Necklace for ( 350p).
purchased 1 Seawind Necklace for ( 400p).
purchased 1 Seawind Necklace for ( 400p).

Hmm I've only sold that many in my bazaar log, must be slacking.
While selling those on the mule I also sold a couple on my main, since
I get them so fast. I think the couple people trying to sell them at
800 - 1500 really help to move them, a person searches and sees those
prices and then sees 350 - 500 and goes "OOH!"

So I'd make some money from that before it is possibly nerfed. She is
a bit low to always be dropping a 10 ac or whatever 15 dex neck piece,
which she also gives a quest for which is not that easy. I can't tell
if it is their intention she drop it or not, it seems that if it was
not they would have altered it by now.
