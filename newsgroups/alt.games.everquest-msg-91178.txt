Last night after the servers came up the first 6 people in Seb were 
myself, 3 60 bards, a 57 BL, and a 60 cleric.  It took about 10 minutes to 
get all the songs worked out, but we because a serious damage machine.  
The cleric was nuking because there was really no need to heal other than 
a remedy every couple fights, and we were killing as fast as we could 
pull.  We were only able to keep the group active for a bit over an hour, 
but it was EASILY the best exp I've ever gotten in 59.  
The group morphed into a rogue group, with 3 59+ rogues, shaman, cleric, 
and I, and then into a normal grind group of warrior, 2 rogues, druid, 
cleric, and I, and we never really took a break.  The thing is that I got 
basically the same amount of exp in 1 hour in the bard group as I did in 3 
hours in the other groups.  The lowest level character in any of the 
groups was the 56 warrior, the characters were all pretty well equipped, 
but the difference in kill-speed was amazing.  
I suspect that the other 3 bards were putting out abuot 2k/minute each, 
plus my 2300/minute in DoTs, plus their charmed pets (we were pulling 3-4 
at a time, bards charm adds and have them attack too).  Group chat was 
full of a bunch of hah-hah and lol and <giggle>.  The BL was loving it and 
the cleric couldn't believe how fast it went.  Of course we did all 
neglect to play manasong for a bit, but about 1 minute with us all pumping 
32 manasong had the cleric to FM.
I know we could have done at least as well replacing the BL with another 
bard, but I'm not sure how we would have done without the cleric.  He did 
go AFK for a few minutes and we had no problems, but an big overpull would 
have been much trickier.  There are 4 active and 1 recruit bard in my 
guild, something tells me I may have to set something up next EXP day.

no worries about camping a cleric with 3 bards with DA too
