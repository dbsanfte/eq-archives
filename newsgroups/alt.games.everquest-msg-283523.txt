For those here who, like me, don't follow the SOE forums regularly,
I'll share the news that developer Maddoc is working on bringing the
boats back.  I hope he also leaves the translocator gnomes in, for
those who are in a hurry or for other reasons prefer not to use the
boats.  (The wording on the gnomes' response to hails might need to
be tweaked slightly, or maybe not.)  But I for one will be pleased
to have the option of a more immersive (hopefully not submersive!)
mode of travel.

As I said, I don't read the forums a lot; the way I discovered this
bit of news was I was in Abysmal Sea (having gotten there by Magus
port from Natimbi as usual, where I have a druid port-in), and in
among the usual droning of NPCs ordering drinks and singing songs
I spotted the emote announcing the imminent arrival of the ship that
used to be the only way to travel in or out of the Abysmal Sea zone.
I ran down to the docks and sure enough, there it was.  I rode it
out to Nedaria's Landing and back, and had no problems staying on
the boat.

According to the forums, Maddoc started with that boat as a test
case to iron out the bugs with boat travel.  Looks good so far!
