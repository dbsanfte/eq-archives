Well, it's not exactly a big red warning, but there IS a small warning
when you get your "you have gained another level, welcome to level 10"
message saying something about "You will now have to go to your body
to retrieve your items when you die".  When you reach level 11 you
also get a short message saying "You will now start losing experience
when you die".

Necros can locate corpses at level 1, bards at level 4, SKs at level
9.

Yeah, between levels 1 and 4 you still got your food, milk and your
newbie weapon but you still had to find your body to get whatever loot
and cash you had; after level 4 you no longer got your food, milk and
newbie weapon (also, one only got 5 food and milk, now newbies get 20
of each).

Also, before level 6 you only had 30 minutes to get to your body to
loot your stuff or it would vanish, along with whatever loot you had
on it at the time; after level six, you then got what is standard now
(24 hours online, one week offline) to get to your body before it
vanished.  So back then anyone who wanted to twink their characters,
if they were smart at least, would wait till they reached level 6 to
twink, since all their nice gear would wind up going *poof* if they
died and couldn't get to their corpse in 30 minutes!  It's a lot
easier to be a twink nowadays! :-P
