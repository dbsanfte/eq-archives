<snip how to get JBB question>

An update, for anyone that may be following this story.  Raised the funds 
mostly by selling Rallic packs.  Then plopped my hiney down in EC and 
watched the spam.   Days passed....  Got sick of watching text scroll one 
sunday morning and logged off.  Got an email.  It said, basically, get yer 
butt into EC NOW!  Someone's selling a JBB for 10k!  I did, and waddled 
over to the first torch.  Trade windows went up, names went green, and now 
I can solo about three times as well.  WOOT!
