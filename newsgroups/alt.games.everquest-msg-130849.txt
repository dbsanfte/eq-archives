Fantastic. Now whenever anyone asks for a port I can say

"get planes of power you cheap bastard!"

I don't have the time to zone twice to be a bus for less
than 500 plat.

Don't worry, you'll be able to. A lot of people never got/use 
luclin. A whole lot more will never get/use planes of power.
Besides that, non porters are such extreme lazy asses that
it is sickening. You'll see a guy with planes of power auctioning for
a port to surefall glade because he doesn't want to bother to go to
freeport
to use the POP teleport system to get to qeynos.
