Cross Bizbee and that's exactly what will happen. He has a track
record for it... and he whines when he gets a taste of his own
medicine.

You have very low standards for the people you elect as your friends.

On the whole, I agree with the sentiment of your argument. 
But......

Do you seriously think that Bizbee stopped for one moment to consider
this before he posted my full address? The theoretical situation you
cited is the exact same *reason* he did it.

He chose the wrong victim for his attempted bullying. When someone
picks a fight with me, I fight back. Only I hit harder.
