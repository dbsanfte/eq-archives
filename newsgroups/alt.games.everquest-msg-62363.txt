    The Deafening Decoy was apparently planned to be an escape method for
mages. Send in the highest taunting pet in the game and scoot while the mob
was busy with it. In practice, it isn't used because when things hit the fan
it's usually because of several mobs, not just one.

    Don't forget Riposte. The second time I cast UHoF, it went straight at a
Drolvarg in Karnor's and died to a riposte on the first swing. That told me
all I needed to know about how good a spell it was.
