This "dedicated DSL circuit" feeds into the same internet as everything 
else. You're just bumping into your neighbours a little farther down the 
pipe.

Most of the dsl marketing about your 'dedicated dsl circuit' is just 
marketing spin. Real performance differences between the two aren't 
terribly dramatic, and the cable company wins latency tests as often as 
not... it depends more on your home address than anything else.

The best advice you'll get is try them both, and pick the better one. 
Its entirely dependant on where you live. The exact infrastructure, 
(capacity and performance) being used in your area has a much greater 
impact than anything so generic as 'dsl vs cable' as competing 
technologies.
