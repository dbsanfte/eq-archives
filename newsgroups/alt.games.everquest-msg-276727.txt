I have 2 accounts, and often 2 box.
As such, I figure I could easily improve any language skills by talking to 
"myself" through each seperate char.

Is this posible?
How?
Can i set up a five line group macro, and then keep hitting a hot key?
How?
Does each char have to be set to the same language?
Does one char remain in common tongue?
Will both chars need to "speak" in order to achieve skill ups, or is 
listening sufficient?
Does the "talk" have to be of a set length, ie, will "hello" be sufficient, 
or should a char say more...."Hello, how is things in Misty today" or 
something longer?

I know this is a long set of questions, but apart from commontongue, I have 
never ventured into another language.

Thanks for any advice.

PS. To what benefit will there be gained from speaking multi tongues?
