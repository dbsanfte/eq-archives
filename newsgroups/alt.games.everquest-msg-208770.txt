Obviously you haven't or you'd realize the likelyhood that having the
account managemnent code, which happens to be the bug under discussion
here would only be intertwined with the server code you're talking about
if the coder were an absolute moron. Or you're just throwing out a red
herring so you can contribute yet another useless usenet flame.

As some people had exactly the same thing happen with the last
downloadable expansion it would appear that SOE doesn't even test for
bugs they've already seen happen before.
