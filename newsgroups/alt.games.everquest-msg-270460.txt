Patch Message Follows = =

*** Headlines ***

- Tons of new quests, mostly for solo players!
- New Character Differentiation option: Training!
- Lots of artisan recipe and ability fixes!
- Eat healthy! New examine information to explain the benefits of food and 
drink!
- Brawlers get built-in shields!
- Guild followers can spend the status they earn at city merchants!
- Now easier to equip rings, wrist items, and weapons!
- Slash that dot! Maps now show your current heading!
- Lots of UI tweaks and enhancements!
- More bug fixes than you can shake a moss snake at!

*** Training ***

- Characters now receive a new character differentiation option every ten 
adventure levels: Training!
- Training allows you to choose one of four new abilities. Each of these 
spells or arts builds off abilities you've been using but substantially 
increases their effectiveness and benefit.
- The choice is yours whether you prefer a stronger attack, a more potent 
buff, a heartier heal, or a handier utility function. Training allows you to 
enhance specific aspects of your character and be a bit unique.
- These Training abilities have a longer span of effectiveness than most 
common spells and arts, so they'll prove very useful to you.
- Note: Characters who reach levels 10 and 20 will not be prompted to make 
their Training selections until they leave their current zone and enter 
another. This is a known issue that will be corrected in a future update.

IMPORTANT!
- You will not be able to receive quest rewards until you make any pending 
character differentiation choices available to you.
