I've talked to Lord of the Rings guys and Dungeons and Dragons guys.We all
Know that D&D was based off of Lord of the rings.But my qestion is...How do
you take your EQ?

If you are Gary Gygax (the inventor of  D&D)
You know you took a concept from a great man and made it your own.Building
around this concept you made a dynamic world the likes of witch have been
haralded for years.
If he was here today  JRR Tolkin would vomit in his shoes to see His work
made into a game such as Everquest.Just kidding...Hehe,come on it's got to
make you smile.?
at least a little bit......
