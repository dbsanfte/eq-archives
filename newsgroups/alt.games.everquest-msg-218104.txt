They've apparantly killed that idea already, even before Beta
testing, I guess just the response of people in the discussion
channels about how annoying this would be got them to remove it.

Personally, I think it had its charms, I'd have gone halfway and
allowed global cash banking but localized "safe deposit box"
banking.. not a  renaissance/medieval flavor then, but at least
not better than what we have in the "real world" today.
