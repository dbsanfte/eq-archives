FT1 is indeed one mana per tick mana regen.  FT items do stack, up to 
FT15.  In addition to flowing thought, you can get spells in the clarity 
line to enchance mana regen, bard songs to do the same, as well as some 
items and/or abilities that will convert hp into mana.  Your sitting mana 
regen will be higher than your standing mana regen, how good is dependant 
on your meditate skill.
