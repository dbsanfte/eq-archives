The late Harry Chapin used to tell the story of how some
representatives from Greyhound buslines once contacted him and
said that they'd like to talk to him about the possibility of
their using his song "Take the Greyhound" for their
advertising.

Chapin's response was, "um, have you ever actually
*listened* to the song?"

It's a song about how much it sucks to ride the bus.
Chorus:

     Take the Greyhound 
     It's a dog of a way to get around
     Take the Greyhound 
     It's a doggone easy way to get you down.
