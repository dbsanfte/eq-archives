    You know, I did read about the sidekick thing, and I have to admit, it
sounds like a great game idea.  But the sad fact is, I don't want to be a
sidekick.  I want to have sidekicks.  Or slaves, whatever. 

   I'm just going to hang on to the hope that agers will create as many
alts in CoH as they tend to do in EQ.
