Yeah it's called Meditate which you get at level 9.  You will need to put at
least 1 practice point in to in order to use it, and it goes up rather
quickly since you spend most of your time sitting =P

When you hit level 14 and get SoW, try trading that for a breeze/clarity
which will help your mana regenerate faster.
