    Their cleric couldn't keep up with the mana needs of an unslowed mob
pounding on whatever they had as the tank. I'm guessing that their main tank
had a lot less AC than your 1000 plus AC. And in a game where AC is king....

    So the only way to create challenge is to remove Turgur from the
encounter. Turgur is a design limitation, pure and simple - that's broken.
Especially since marking a mob 100% MR screws up a lot of other things, not
just Turgur.

    Comes from the definition of "boss mob", though, doesn't it? ;-) If it's
slowable, it's a "gimp". If it isn't, it's a "boss mob". And you've
sidestepped the point. In a high-end encounter, you have clerics casting
CHeal over and over. Against top mobs, the only way to keep up is to grab an
NPC friend to help (more FEESH), and/or have the CHeals on a cycle so
multiple CHeals land on the focus over the course of the normal casting time
of the spell. That's a lot of CHeals. I land Turgur ONCE, then every few
minutes I refresh. I need one shaman to be present to negate entirely 75% of
a mob's damage output - maybe a second shaman for redundancy. I NEED HOW
many clerics to keep up with a mob's damage output, again?

    Any effect that allows for percent reductions or increases is usually
amongst the most powerful in a given game, unless the percentages are kept
quite small. Look at the "percentage" effects in EQ: haste. Slowdowns.
Defensive. They're not only HUGE, they're GAME-DEFINING. THAT is broken. The
only time I've seen CHeal be that broken is when it's used as a heal on a
charmed pet as a 10 K heal. Using it as a "100% heal" on things with very
little life compared with standard damage output isn't very broken.
