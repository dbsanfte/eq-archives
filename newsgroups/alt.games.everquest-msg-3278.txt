Two t-shirts owned by a friend of mine....

One shows a bottle with an octipus-headed... thing.... oozing its way out. Caption
reads, "Cthulhu Tequila. When you want a worm, get the Great Worm."

Second shows a portrait of Cthulhu looking off in the distance, American flag waving
behind it. Caption is "Cthulhu for President. Why pick the LESSER of evils?"

First, it is ridiculed.
Second, it is violently opposed.
Third, it is accepted as being self-evident."
