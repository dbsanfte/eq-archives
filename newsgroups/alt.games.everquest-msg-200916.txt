On Xev, I offer 10-25pp up front and have never been turned down for my
level 35 and under chars. And you can't pass through Nexus or PoK without
being spammed by folks who are giving away KEI for FREE!!! (donations
excepted). I doubt the many teen casters with KEI paid *anything* for it.

Finding KEI on a sub-20 caster is about as surprising as finding SoW on a
sub-20 warrior nowadays. It's not a secret known only to the elite few,
reserved for those with a 4-digit bank account. *Everyone* knows about KEI,
and you can get it for a song. Really!
