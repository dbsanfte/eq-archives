As of the latest patch Verant really help us Monks out for a plat or 2 any
Mage or Shaman Level 16 and above will summon Deminsional Pockets for you Wt
0.1 100 % reduction. You now have 30 minutes to relog on after Loging or
going LD before they will dissapear. Just bank or sell everything before
logging basically best case you can loot 30 Items allowing 2 slots for food
and drink and not gain 1 stone.  I have gotten 8 bags 20 food, 20 drink, 100
bandages, and 1 heatstone for 3pp-5pp from a 20 mage and he didnt use a full
bar of mana to summon. you just have to hit a vendor before logging.
