I'm still attempting to do the variouis Craft Keeper quests (cap, trousers,
robe, etc). This fellow gave me the assembly kit, but now won't give me any of
the patterns.

Anyone else having/had this problem?

I have tried several different ways and sentences asking about and for the
pattern for the caps (as per the advice I was given here), but he has yet to
respond.

Would someone else please try to do this quest and let me know if they also
have the same problem? He is on the second floor of the palace. Concidering
what I've been reading of SOE's support, I am not certian I want to approach
them on the matter.
