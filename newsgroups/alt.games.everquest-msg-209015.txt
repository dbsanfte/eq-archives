There is, but they aren't worth it. The Jaggie Pine Crook can be had at
~level 8-10. The problem is the spawn of gnoll hunters and the drop rate of
the items needed is so slow it is impractical. It was an OK weapon back in
1999. The newer weapon drops all make it pale in comparison.

There are two extremely rare drops off of gnolls in Blackburrow, Runed Totem
Staff and Gnoll Hide Lariat, that you can get with a small group of level
10-12 characters. You be so high of a level before you see one drop that you
have to go somewhere else for experience.

Things are better for Paladins. You can get a Lightbringer mace at really
low levels as soon as you can afford ~3 pp to pay off NPCs for their
services.
