I wouldnt worry on an ethics point. While quite fancy these things are
common traded items. I got mine at level 9....in fact I got 3 velium weaps
which a guy was prepared to trade for a fairly basic bow (one above
hickory) and 20 plat....now I see people trying to shift them for 5-10
plat each....they are unpopular I guess as the proc is not useful at the
level it fires. Cetainly on Torvonnilous they seem to be the typical low
level first magic weapon for a number of classes.
