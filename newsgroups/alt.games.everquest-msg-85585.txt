There are a couple things you must remember when useing the Monk Shaman
combo. 1 the Shaman should be bound as close as possible yet in a safe spot
to gate to for when you FD. If  Shaman is a 34 have a pet summoned but
guarding Shammy if the shit hits the fan send the pet in and you FD while
the Shaman Gates.
2. Also need to remember a Monk can not taunt if the Shaman does too much
Damage it will be very hard for the Monk to pull them off him. Shaman should
use slow longer lasting dots and only nuke as a last resort..
