[Wed Jan 17 03:55:10 2001] You say, 'hail Hasten Bootstrutter'
[Wed Jan 17 03:55:10 2001] Hasten Bootstrutter says 'Stopped, I 
   have.  Greet you, I do.  What business do we have? Hmm?  
   Speak up!!
[Wed Jan 17 03:55:29 2001] You say, 'What journeyman boots?'
[Wed Jan 17 03:55:29 2001] Hasten Bootstrutter says 'Journeyman's 
   boots are what you seek?  Ha!!  Those I have upon my feet 
   and disintegrate will they if my life is taken.  Extra pair 
   have I, and, possibly, [rare trade] can we make.
[Wed Jan 17 03:55:41 2001] You say, 'What rare trade?'
[Wed Jan 17 03:55:41 2001] Hasten Bootstrutter says 'Three things 
   I call for and journeyman boots are yours. A [shadowed rapier],
   [ring of the ancients] and gold... 3250 gold coins I call 
   for !!  This trade I call.
[Wed Jan 17 03:55:48 2001] You say, 'What shadowed rapier?'
[Wed Jan 17 03:55:49 2001] Hasten Bootstrutter says 'Shadowed 
   men, foes to all, have appeared.  Many lands do they walk.
   Invisible are they, but for the items they wield.  Seek 
   them out and return to me a shadowed rapier.  Return it 
   with haste before 'poof' goes the rapier!!  No time 
   to camp have you.
[Wed Jan 17 03:56:07 2001] You say, 'What ring of the ancients?'
[Wed Jan 17 03:56:07 2001] Hasten Bootstrutter says 'Ancient 
   cyclopes do march the land.  Long have they lived and 
   crafted the rings of the ancients.  I must have one and 
   you shall go and fetch one for me.  Seek the lands of the 
   oldest cyclops clans.  Seek the plains, seek the island 
   in tears and search the dunes for there is one who is last. 
   His clan was blown from the sands.

And during the turn-in:

[Tue Jan 16 11:25:36 2001] Hasten Bootstrutter says 'The 
   time to trade has come!!  I am now rich and you are 
   now fast.  Take the journeyman boots and run like the wind.
[Tue Jan 16 11:25:36 2001] You gain experience!!
