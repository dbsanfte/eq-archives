    I would guess his theory is that either druids passing through from SFG
would see Hadden up on track and wax him more frequently than before, or
that the presence of a nearby port would attract druids to put Hadden on
their farm lists. Now I've never, EVER seen Hadden up except for the one
time I sat down in front of his hut and shooed people away for hours late at
night until he popped, so I can't imagine him being even MORE hunted than he
is now, but I guess Jacobson has seen him last longer than the cast time on
a level 49 plus nuke.
