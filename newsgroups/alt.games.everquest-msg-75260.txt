Unfortunately, while this is helpful, its not adequate to the task
really.

You need crap buffs by the dozen, and a bunch of other buffs that
don't really come handily in group form.

Sure, if you have a bunch of level 60s who have come to buff you
up you might be able to make this work... but most of the time
a Vox raid (limit 52 for the people doing the actual killing) isn't
going to field all that many 60s.

Paladin : endure disease, endure fire, endure poison.  Also armor of
faith
for non tanks
Ranger : feet like, see invis, other useless buffs, the cheaper the
better
Necromancer: DMF
Cleric one: SOW for tanks only (mana expensive)
Shaman: Talisaman
Cleric two: Heroic Bond (first one that can hit a group on this list)
Cleric three Symbol
Druid Circle of Summer, group Chloroplast (both group target again)
DS for tanks
Enchanter: Clarity for casters, Haste for tanks

Not only do all these go on, but they go on in pretty much that order.
If you run around putting good buffs on people without crap buffs
on first, they are just going to get stripped.

Log out.. even if you have people who can hit your whole group with
all that, by the time they have adequate mana up to do the whole raid,
the first group they buffed will be losing cheap buffs and the DS and
Haste
buffs, which have short durations.  Its not just the logistics of
buffing
24+ people in a row, mana is a bottleneck too, otherwise this could
have been done with only slight efficiency loss by having the buffers
invited into 5 man groups.  Targetgroupbuff is only 1/6th more efficient

for the buffers, you know.

It is true that high level dragon type encounters which don't feature
a withering debuff like the Lady can now be done without the need
for the irritating buff and camp cycle, but I'll bet 50pp that a
successful
Vox raid mounted by a non uber-guild is still going to use one.

Hmm, another thought, everyone should have a mod rod in hand and
probably one of those mage summons that fits in Range slot to give
more cold resist (unless you have a better than what, 15 CR in range
already?)  These aren't time dependant like the buffs though, as long
as you aren't camped out for more than 30 minutes.  The CR item
is to help keep you alive, and the mod rod is to give to the clerics
after to speed the process of resing the ones that didn't.
