Wow, you got to use 4 to 8 characters in variable names in BASIC?  Talk
about spoiled.  Back when I started playing with BASIC, it was two
characters max, and they couldn't both be letters.  And, we had to walk
uphill in the snow barefoot to get to the teletype everyday.  Well, we did
have that one high speed, 300 baud video display terminal.  IIRC there were
something like 10 devices, mostly teletypes, hooked up to a PDP-8 running
some bastardized timesharing system in use at the high school, and the only
form of permanent storage available to us was the paper tape punch/reader on
the teletypes.  Then, I got to go to College, and graduated to using card
punches and readers, or if I wanted to play in APL, the daisy wheel
terminals.
