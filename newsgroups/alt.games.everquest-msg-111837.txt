Ok, if this is a reference to my insightful LOL post in the hj thread, yes I
know I should have snipped it.  However, no matter what you do you face a
flaming from someone.  If you top-post a short comment, people flame you for
top-posting.  If you put the comment at the bottom of the full text, people
flame you because they had to scroll through all of the original text.  If
you snip the original text, people flame you because their news server
didn't get the original message and they have no idea what the hell you're
talking about and/or they want the rest of the post.  It's really a
lose-lose-lose situation.  So I suggest learning to deal with it.
