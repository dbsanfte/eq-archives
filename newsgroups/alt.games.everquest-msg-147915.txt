Some interesting items on the front page at www.legacyofsteel.net.

First, consider the Sanguine Robe:

    Magic, No Drop
    AC: 35
    Skill Mod: +10% Research
    STA:+25  INT:+15  HP:+125  MANA:+100
    All saves:+15
    Recommended level: 60
    Effect: Aura of Battle (Worn)
    Focus Effect: Sanguine Preservation
    WT: 1.0 Size: Medium
    Class: NEC WIZ MAG ENC

What's up with +10% Research?  By the time you can get this robe, aren't you
well past the research stage?

How about the Robe of Secrets?

    Magic, Lore, No Drop
    AC: 45
    Skill Mod: +10% Evocation
    STA,CHA,INT:+25  HP,MANA:+125
    All saves:+20
    Recommended level: 60
    Effect: Flowing Thought VII (Worn)
    WT: 1.0 Size: Tiny
    Class: NEC WIZ MAG ENC

There's other interesting things there, but those stood out to me as a
Wizard as being the most interesting (although the Club of Gnoll Bashing
would be nice for when getting faction in Blackburrow...:-))
