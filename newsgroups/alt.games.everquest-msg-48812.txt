I was in EQ beta and was on till they shut down beta and they never did a
PvP thing, or at least not on the server I was on.  Only thing they did was
the events, the giant mobs, I saw a giant dead gnoll near Black Burrow.
And they didn't even really say thank you or anything to the server I was
on, a GM logged off HOURS before the end of beta and said goodbye and then
at the end it was "Server not responding" and nothing else.
