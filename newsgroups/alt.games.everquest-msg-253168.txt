     I would guess that not too often, but this isn't the first time I've
heard of it happening.  And it is mystifying.  I mean, what they basically
have to say to themselves is "I'm tired of playing, think I'll call it a
career.  But I have all these friends that I've made along the way.  What
to do?  I know, I'll cause them all to feel grief and sadness!"  I don't
know why anyone would want to do that to any friend they've made, online or
not.

    And, I would guess, would make the account worthless to whatever poor
sap ends up buying it, if it goes that route.  Not that I feel too bad
about that part of it.
