He is in a guild that requires all members to use nothing but equipment 
that they can get at their level, they are not allowed to purchase items 
in the bazaar.  They must hunt for, quest for, make their own equipment.  
He is the highest level character in the guild at level 30, so there are 
probably no shaman that can whip up sow potions for him in the guild.  I 
don't recall all the exact details of the rules they play under, so I may 
have gotten some of it wrong, but that is the basic concept.
