Of course theres always gonna be those that dislike/hate a game.  But I
heard theres a guild in EQ that almost everyone of them tested DAoC and
everyone was leaving EQ for DAoC.  I talked to a female character a week or
two before beta ended and she told me "I just got my beta account a few days
ago, I believe it's time for me to cancel my EQ account"
But most people that I talked to that stated the disliked DAoC was people
that was in late Beta 2 or early Beta 3 before there was tons of stuff
added.  But now theres horses, dungeons, vaults to put items in, tons of
quests, soon to be housing, and all kinda of stuff they have talked much
about.  Best of all great CSR's.
