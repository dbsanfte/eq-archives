True. But I don't care if Yantis sells plat or items. I care if it
negatively impacts eqs economy. I expect this would greatly dampen the
amount of impact he could have.

After all, for yantis to 'acquire' the items in question he'd have to
obtain them directly, or trade for them. If he's acquiring them
directly, he's not going to be getting them fast or easy. If he's
trading for them he's going to be trading 'equivalent items' mostly...
I'm not going to trade ornate for any number of peridots... I'm going
to want some other high end item. That will prevent him from macroing
cash and using it to purchase items.

Once he had them, sure he could sell them for cash... but so what? How
does that negatively impact the honest player?
