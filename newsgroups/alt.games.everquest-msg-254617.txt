You are in the correct area for getting mammoths.  They all spawn in the area 
you are at except one or two a lot further south.  Best to have track to find 
them though.  Another option is to kill the big spiders in the southwest part 
of that big open area.  They won't drop loot for cash but they may be your 
level and some can be single pulled.  Would be an idea while waiting for 
respawns.
