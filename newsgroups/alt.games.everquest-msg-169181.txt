Actually though, I'd hate this guy not so much because he's anti-roleplaying
but because he's a beggar and an asshole to boot.  I don't owe anyone
anything, I don't care how much they think they need it.  Usually I'll help
someone out who needs something, but if they come up to me and let me know
that I *owe* it to them, they can forget about it.

As far as anti-roleplaying though... I don't roleplay a lot, though I do
sometimes when the mood strikes me, but I don't understand how *anyone* on
EQ could find roleplaying offensive.  For one thing it does *not* make the
game harder for them, although it may make it harder for them to weasel what
they want out of roleplayers.  For another, unless I greatly misremember, EQ
is, uh, an RPG.  RPG, for all those to whom it never occurred, means
"Roleplaying Game".  I mean, seriously, if you can't stand roleplayers then
go play an FPS game.  Why the hell would you even play a game whose whole
point is roleplaying if you think it's "gay ass"??
