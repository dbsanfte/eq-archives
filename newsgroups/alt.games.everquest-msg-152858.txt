While I'm quite happy with the battlecleric boost, it doesn't particularly
apply to clerics under 56, and barely at all to clerics under 54.  56 is
where we get the uber hammer, and Yaulp V that alters our melee
output and mana regen situation.  54 is where we get the pet with the
drastically reduced casting cost.  Below that, the only addition was
bash, and I don't really think that makes a critical difference in solo
capability.  Once you have the other three tools, bash helps a lot
by enabling a higher rate of caster interupt and adding more melee
damage output... but those things only apply if you are a decent
melee damage producer in the first place.  Solo clerics under 54
should stick to root and nuke tactics against non casting mobs,
just as they did prior to the patch, I'd think.
