 They also never run out of arrows.

 In theory this doesn't/shouldn't happen. They can LAND a spell on you 
without line of sight but they had to have LOS to begin casting. As a
puller I've used this to my advantage many times. Having said that I
think I've encountered a few instances where I got hit by a spell after
the mob started casting without LOS. This seems to be a low percentage
and is perhaps related to lag.
