On the other hand if you are able to anticipate emergencies they are 
perfectly functional... but then ... so is: Gate. (OP was a caster 
right?)

Its worth adding that Bards -can- use potions and clickies while on the 
move. ie their 'special ability to move while casting' applies to all 
casting. This is very handy. (However they can't cast while a song is 
active... I've died to this a few times... maddly clicking my items and 
nothing happening because selo's is still up... :)

For emergencies: see Gate

The buff slot is unlikely to be a problem in this situation (soloing); 
at least. And if you are using it as an escape... then its worth keeping 
a buff slot open for it ;)

AE Stun & Run might be viable

Hehehe
