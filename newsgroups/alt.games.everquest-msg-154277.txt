AM3 and EQ means archery is a real alternative to melee damage at the higher
levels.  The outdamaging rogues isnt sustained (if they needed to use TS to
do it), but beating monks with EQ/Am3 is sustained damage that is open to
any 59 character who wants to invest time on their character and work at
some AA levels.

Maybe it does take a lot of AA levels (I dont think its a huge cost) - the
option is still there.  I have 139 AA levels, and I have NOTHING that can
give me 32k damage inside a minute at raid levels, let alone sustained
damage output that puts me ahead of classes I was previously behind.

Even a chanter with DC can have better DPS than a monk with equal AA levels

Well it was a reply to your " Says who?  The guy taking the damage, or the
guy healing the damage?"

Which to me implied.. "look im the cleric not you, I know what you guys get
hit for".  I've played a cleric a long time now, and whilst I dont profess
to know as much about the class as a "real" high end raiding cleric, I know
how to be very effective in exp groups, in certain raids, on cheal rotations
etc

> me to change my mind... but the word of a botter doesn't hold

Well it isnt said to impress you, don't judge bots all as the same though.

One of our main clerics runs 3 chars EVERY raid (cleric,chanter,monk) and is
always on the ball.  Never misses a cheal, is usually the first to charm/mez
that add, monk is always meleeing etc.  If you ask for a buff its done
within seconds, shes not "a botter", even if you knew all 3 were her chars,
you'd swear she was lieing and really had 3 people there

That monks tank better than warriors?  Well, I tested this just last night.
I was the MA for King Tormax.
He's a mob that dies first time, every time, guaranteed.  A LD cleric or 2
doesnt matter, hes a mob we have the better of, and more often than not, 1
tank lives through the fight.

After the laughing and snide comments when it was announced (lots of
/mourns.. /bye etc).. well heres some snippets from the log -

[Thu Oct 10 22:43:04 2002] Cmax waves goodbye to Meemers.
[Thu Oct 10 22:44:26 2002] Chrysalid tells stasisxxxx:6, 'lol, meemers MA?
:)'
[Thu Oct 10 22:45:04 2002] Chrysalid tells stasisraids:4, 'lol :)  monk ma?
:)  /sigh i am missing a good show'
[Thu Oct 10 22:45:33 2002] Warrunner tells stasisraids:4, 'this MA is
sucking all my mana'

I dont think I need to highlight the last line, but i was a SPONGE for the
clerics.  I tanked him to 50% before I died (the rotation kinda went to pot,
I got  3 cheals in the time I should have gotten 12-14, and when captain
bvellos and the Staff Sergeant agrod, they were on me also, including that
gay dispell sword on my buffs!^%%)

Even if I had lived though (a cleric getting agro had messed up the rotation
when I died which meant missed heals, and the massive mana drain meaning
missed heals from rods) I was SO inefficient compared to a warrior

Black and white, MONKS DO NOT TANK BETTER THAN WARRIORS.  THATS A FACT

Missed what point?  You said, "a well geared monk is approaching an average
warrior in terms of HP"
Well my point is thats no way a valid comparison.

We have shamans who would be so far ahead of 60 warriors in terms of AC and
HP that in an exp group the shaman tanking probably wouldn't be a massively
noticable difference.  Clerics with 1200+ AC, I bet in Seb they could tank
as effectively as a 60 warrior in far lesser gear

Well I know PLing isnt quite the same, but I found cheal to be more
efficient than divine light/celestial on my shadowknight at 44.  Of course I
was going for absolute maximum efficiency

If I was down 1023 HP I wouldnt even expect a heal, let alone cast one
myself.  If I kill a spider in velks and I have 4k hp left, i dont heal
myself for 2k, I just go pull again, and again, then when im at 800-1k I
will cast a cheal

Its significant in that like for like, the rogue will get exp EVERY time
versus a monk.  I can fight a mob, a rogue jumps in at 80%, they can get
exp.

If I jump on a warriors mob at 80%, its unlikely I will get exp

/disc defensive far exceeds what a monk has in the way of defence.  Theres
nothing a monk can do to make up that HP discrepancy

Which is the exact same reason monks can appear "as efficient" as warriors.
So no, rather than fix warriors (the real class with a problem), or fix the
fuckin AC system overall, they decide to screw the monk.

Newsflash, nerfing monks does not make warriors even *1* percent better at
tanking and defending, it just means in a few months time the argument
switches to rogues or rangers, verant took the easy way out with this hack
(its not a fix), they gave it little thought and it will not make the
problem go away

Yeah, so are they gonna nerf monks, rangers and rogues because of high level
AC cap problems, or are they gonna get their heads out of their asses and
fix the real problem, the fuckin' AC system?

A dead tank means big problems usually.. being able to FD for a split second
while that cheal lands is what makes the difference for me in picking a tank
of chain/leather classes

Instead of holding out for 6 monks?  If i wanted a KS group Id hold out for
6 rogues, nothing else

Warriors at the high level do good damage.  Thats why I post against your

so far from the truth

So give us avoidance that actually makes a damn difference as destroying our
mitigation

So say I have 1400 AC, guild warrior has 1600 AC.. is it MY fault, or the
MONKS fault that verants hardcap means anything over 1250-1300 is useless?
THAT is where the problem lies, and this wont fix anything.   Verant can
nerf monks into oblivion, it still won't matter, other classes can, will and
do approach those AC levels.

Fixing AC would have fixed warriors, it would have also fixed hybrids
tanking, because gear for gear, warriors and palis/SK's have more AC than
all the other classes

Ok, I demand SoW speed, run speed, walk speed to be effected by character
weight.  How the fuck does a warrior with 100lbs of armour run as fast as
me, weighing 9lbs?

If you want the game to be realistic then lets add in these things too.  I
also want to avoid hits more than 6% that a person 10x my weight does - 6%
is not a noticable difference, and I guarantee in r/l you would see a very
noticable difference

I want to be able to jump higher, swim faster than some fat bastard in a
suit of plate

My guild monk HP's range from 4.9k to 6.2k (2 monks over 6k, rest are all
below).  The 2 above 6k have been in the guild since day 1.  A warrior who
joined 4 months ago (with very little raid gear) has received sufficient
upgrades so that hes now at 7khp.

The 4.9k hp monk joined at the same time as this warrior (they came from the
same guild) - see a difference there?

Our warriors on a par with those 2 monks (we did have 1 warrior who was
ahead of everybody in terms of gear, hp but he left to join a bigger guild a
few months ago) are around 7.3khp.  These are warriors who were elevated
into the number 1 spot because of a guildie departing, so have been getting
geared up in recent times, the 2 monks have always been #1 and #2 for monks,
their gear has been built up over a long time for this
