My shaman twink has done the quest, in order, and is now stuck at a point
where his faction isn't high enough to get the next step.  I haven't really
read any spoilers on the quest, thus probably why I've actually done it in
order.  It would appear that I *need* to go back and re-do a step to get my
faction high enough to finish it, but then I read your plight and that
doesn't seem very appealing either.

Ahh well, at least mine is just a shaman twink.
