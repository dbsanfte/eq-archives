I don't know.  We did try the trick with having a ranger locate where the
reaver that spawns Neh'Ashiir is, then have a mage cast pillar of flame to
aggro.  The reaver aggroed, but would not come down to play no matter where
the mage moved to.  Some friends of mine, including some present at that
time, did successfully pull him one patch earlier.
