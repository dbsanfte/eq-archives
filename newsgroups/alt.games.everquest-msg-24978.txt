Our GL tried to sponsor a guild event on the big ship once for a dueling
match. Then somebody pointed out that, not only can't you cast, but the
melee types lose all their stamina in short order. Bad idea. Plus, if
you happen to lose a duel and die just short of zoning, the CR is a
nightmare. In short.......... 
BZZZZZZT!
