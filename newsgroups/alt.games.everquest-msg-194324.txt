Yup, I play a druid and you're right. They are way better than other
classes. That's why they are so popular. Is it unbalanced? I guess so. Don't
really care. It is what it is.

Look at the fudge-packing paladins have taken throughout the history of the
game. They can't do anything well.

Look at the fudge packing enchanters have taken throughout the history of
the game. other than aggro monsters with mezz, they can't do anything well.

And Magicians?  ... hehe ... well I never even thought of playing a
conjuring class. Whoop De Do. Summon me up a bandage, would ya?

I've played both the pally and enchanter up into the high 30's when it
dawned on me - they are among the disfavored children of Everquest. So screw
it, I started a druid.

It is what it is...

Wizzies are still a favored class. Don't grump too much. Try life as a Pally
or Chanter. Spend a lot of time doing CR.
