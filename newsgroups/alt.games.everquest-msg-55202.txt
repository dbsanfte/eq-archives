I did not, and still do not, agree that the name is a violation.  My "point"
is that the GM should have attempted to give their ruling as to "why".  I
would have known then why they were refusing and maybe could have explained
to them the error of their ways.

BTW, Georg was wrong.  Coeurd'Aigle is not a 3 word phrase.  2 words, yes.
However, the GM did offer up Steelheart (French would be Coeurd'Acier).

What really is apparent, though, is the ethno-centric attitude of some of
the GMs.  How would they have handled it should someone whose native
language is not English asked for (and got) a clear violation in a foreign
language or asked for something that fits all the rules (as I believe mine
did) but, because they are illiterate in the foreign language, decide it
must be a violation.
