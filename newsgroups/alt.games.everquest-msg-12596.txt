Unless you are an Iksar, there is no low level area for you in LOIO. You
won't
be able to sell anything without travel all the way across the zone, which
will
100% guaranteed, get you killed, assuming you could even make it TO the
newbie
Iksar area without dying.... that's not likely either. Stay out of LOIO
until you are level 19
at least.
