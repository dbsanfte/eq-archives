Hmm, let me think abou-  YES!  YES!  YES!

MA > all.  Keep MA alive and you can rez dead party members later.

That doesn't mean you ignore party members, keep them alive as much as
possible.  But if it's a choice between keeping the MA up and any party
members alive, /mourn groupmate.

As an aside, Divine Arbitration is a godsend (no pun intended) for keeping
your group alive.  It works on your group even if you have a non-group
person targeted.  So keep MA on target but use DA to heal the person low on
health in your own group.  Very useful AA.

> Should I be trying to keep an eye on other clerics health?

Not usually... clerics should be taking care of themselves.  And, actually,
someone else like a druid should be keeping an eye on clerics if possible.

Try typing /tar charactername.  For example, to target me, type /tar Monual.
If they have some hideously long name, usually only the first few characters
are necessary, i.e. /tar monu to get me.
