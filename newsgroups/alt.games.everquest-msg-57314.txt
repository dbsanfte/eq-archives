ISDN channels in the US are 64Kbps too, it's an international standard.

As for the raid thing, turn down your graphic options, turn off all
unnecessary
options in your chatfilter and type /serverfilter on.  This keeps all chat
data
you have turned off from being sent to you and reduces lag in large
raids.
