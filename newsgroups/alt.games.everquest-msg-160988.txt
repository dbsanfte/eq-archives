As others have pointed out, splitpaw armor may be your play. Not only is
the mask a lightsoure (my monk used one for many many levels) but the
gloves are a "magic weapon" for monks so you can punch creatures like
wisps and ghouls that require a magic weapon to hit.  If there's anyone
bothering to sell the stuff in the bazaar (and that's a big if) it's
probably going for nearly free. Failing that, get to South Karana and
check the merchants at the centaur village and the aviak village.
There's a good chance those items were dumped on vendors there and
you'll still get them on the cheap.
