It can be beneficial, in my opinion, to "force" newbies to discover
the world "the hard way".  It's a positive experience I think most
"oldbies" have forgotten.  With that in mind, I support fast and
easy travel for "oldbies" using one of the methods I suggested in
another post.

However, it's possible my experience was not the typical experience.
Walking through new lands, avoiding dangers, discovering new things,
all that was very, VERY exciting to me.  It really helped me get me
addicted to EQ in the first place.  What will I discover next?!

If, as a newbie, I had had the "instant gratification" of the "every
class is a porting class" system, I'm not sure I'd have enjoyed EQ
half as much as I did.  Sure, you can always take the hard road.
But given the option, most people will probably be compelled to take
the safe/easy road.  And then miss out on some great experiences...
