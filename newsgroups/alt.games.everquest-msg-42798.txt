    You did if you wanted him to sit at the keyboard and play a necromancer
through the lower levels.

    It is inherently silly if you believe the sole purpose of a game is to
be amused by it at all times while playing it, and by actively playing it.
As I have pointed out, some people are willing to forego amusement now to
gain greater amusement later, and seek to minimize the "boring" bits. As
Bergh later pointed out, he gains amusement from seeing what the game engine
is capable of - the very act of NOT being at keyboard and levelling gives
him amusement.

    I would guess that your response is directly related to being shown that
we don't all value what you do, and find your "get a life" comment quite
ironic.

>I apologize for making you see things you weren't prepared to face.

    Likewise.
