For me, to even think about spending 500+ dollars on a stupid output
device, it better make an insane friggn horribly obvious night/day
difference. I would settle for a simple 14 inch 50 buck monitor like
the one I use now. I've used flat screens to play the same games I
play on this monitor and I notice no difference at all. There is no
friggn way the price of my system is gonna be jacked up by some damn
hype about the new wave of monitors being LCD or whatever this week's
fad is, I worry about the chip/memory/videocard/soundcard and a good
motherboard. Those are mainly all you need to consider for gameplay or
any other kind of computing, there is absolutely nothing that makes me
want to waste 500 dollars on a damn LCD monitor and I suggest you guys
quit buying them so damn much so they might go down in price a bit if
you just have to have one.
