www.newegg.com

www.micropro.com

I've had good experiences recently with the above three.  Be aware that 
MicroPro, in particular, has much different prices on pricewatch 
(www.pricewatch.com) than on the regular site.  With them, it pays to check  
PW first.  I did, and got a Chaintech GF4Ti4600 Special Edition (i.e. w/ 
ramsinks, pack-in games, VIVO cable, etc.) for $320...that's a terrific 
price.
