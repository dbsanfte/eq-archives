Not at all. Not knowing the tricks higher-complexity applications of
the skill can teach you, it's very possible to end up producing a good
amount of products that are too low quality to be useable.

Your talent in debate is staggering.

And, yet, rather than providing a counterpoint, you resorted to
idiotic sarcasm. That would be a dodge.

Not at all.

Mind you, the marketability of the end products in comparison to the
production cost of the product isn't factored into judging the system
itself. The problems there are a whole other matter that would require
more fundamental changes to the game overall.
