OK ok a bit of a sanity check here.
Having worked in the biz for over 20 years, I have seen this exact
situation before. Sony was making a nice chuck of change off EQ but
someone though it could be more hence SoL. Bring more ppl with better
graphics, more varied playing areas, appeal to a higher percentage of
potential customers. In this they have failed terribily.
This is a horrible piece of software. How do I know? Ive seen bad
software so many times for so long and they all have the same ear
marks as SoL. A lot of peoples jobs are on the line here and I bet its
not the ones that made the call to push SoL out before it was tested.
Yep this software was in no definition of the word "Beta" tested. What
they did was called an Alpha test. Pure and simple a stupid move to
make more money. 
People are pissed and have a right to be. Sony and VI deserve every
barb thown at them reasonable or not. So what happens next?  Dont know
depends on Verrants ability to win back what they have lost. My bet is
a lot of people get fired when revenues drop as they surely must since
they have reduced the potential new customer pool, the target of SoL
in the first place.
As for me GOing LD is my main problem, always happens at worst
possible moment too LOL.
