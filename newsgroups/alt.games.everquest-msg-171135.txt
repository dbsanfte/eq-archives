}Now, I never said I did not think he was Christian.

Ah, you meant, "I would be highly surprised if he would admit that David 
Koresh was Christian (not that I think he wasN'T, mind you)", didn't you?
                                             ^^^
}But various Christians
}have different definitions of Christianity and I've met very few who think
}David Koresh was a Christian.  I'm not Christian myself so I prefer to pass
}on this particular point.  You do have to take into account that although he
}considered Christ the anointed one, he also considered himself to be Christ

No, he considered himself to be another anointed one.  Important but 
subtle difference. :)

}> }Besides, we're talking about the 1st Amendment, not the 2nd.  The

}Hmm... as I understood it, he was abusing kids and building up a private
}army... that may have been just media propaganda though, correct me if I'm
}wrong.

Charge #1 was never proven, and probably made up to excuse having run 
over his house with a tank.  Charge #2 is well within his 2nd amendment 
rights.  

}If I was mistaken then yes, he was denied his rights... but if I'm
}right, then there were legal reasons completely aside from his religion that
}caused the confrontation, although it could be argued the the federal
}government went too far.

The issue will never be fully settled, especially by people who weren't 
even there. :)  But there's considerable evidence that the Government bit 
the wax tadpole on this one.
