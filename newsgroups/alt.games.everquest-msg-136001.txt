"For Windows XP Professional, the maximum number of other computers that
are
permitted to simultaneously connect over the network is ten. This limit
includes all transports and resource sharing protocols combined. For
Windows
XP Home Edition, the maximum number of other computers that are permitted
to
simultaneously connect over the network is five."

"Note that this limitation applies only to inbound connections to Windows

XP. When you use Windows XP, unlimited outbound connections can be
established to other systems. "
