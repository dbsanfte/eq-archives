67 Days, 12 hours, 48 minutes.

Holy crap on a stick.

That long ago, measured in terms of sitting in front of my computer 
playing one character, a little Erudite wizard named Jakiss stumbled out 
of the darkness of Tox Forrest by Erudin and decided he wanted to cast 
big nukes some day and burn down the damned world.

Tonight, at just before 8pm est USA, he dinged 65 and scribed Strike of 
Solusek, the biggest nuke ever seen.

And wouldn't you know the first fucking one got resisted.

Later on, it would crit for over 5K.

But first it had to totally fail.

Some shit never changes.

It's been a long strange road. But I *liked* it.
