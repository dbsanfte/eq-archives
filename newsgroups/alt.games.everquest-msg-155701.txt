I am sorry to say, you did pretty well for your level.  A blue of exp (give
or take) for each member of a 5 person group for 9 total kills . . . you
will one day look back at this and think your exp bar was flying.  There are
a couple pieces of advice I can give you on this.

First, try and pull blue cons.  The exp vs. time spent efficiency seems to
be highest when you hunt a steady stream of blues.  Unless you are well
equipped enough that you can do a steady stream of yellows or whatever.  But
my point is that steady pulls are more important than individual
higher-level monsters for good experience.

Second, and way more important than the first, is to just learn to ignore
your exp bar.  Group with people you like and play the game.  You may take
longer to reach that next "ding" than you could have done, but it will feel
like it all went by more quickly if you do it in good company.  I guess
that's true of a lot of things in life, but the advice applies well to this
game.

Good luck, and have fun.
