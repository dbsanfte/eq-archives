So, for the longest time I've wanted a custom signature pic.  =)  Alas, no
one I know is a good artist and I myself still draw in stick figures.
>--|o

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone knows someone who could make a custom
original pic based on my character Monual.

Here's a study of Monual, showing him from different angles standing and
kneeling.  The jpeg is ridiculously huge and incoherent, emphasizing my lack
of any artistic ability whatsoever:

http://www.sterman.org/monstudy.jpg

Don't look at the main site, it's months out of date and incomplete and none
of the links go anywhere.  I also lack HTML skill.

So, here's the pic as I see it:

I want Monual in white armor.  Not the silver armor in the pic, but like
shining white.  (Alas that EQ doesn't allow you to dye your armor white.)  I
want him on one knee, looking battered and worn.  The white armor is nicked
and slightly dented, obviously well-worn and hurting a bit from some recent
attack.  I like the look of Monual's face - a kind of Quaker look to it,
long and stern, black hair and white beard with no moustache.  I'd like his
expression to be grim, almost angry.  His hands should be glowing a kind of
blue-white, preparing to cast a healing spell.  I was thinking of having him
wield a Time hammer but A) it would date the sig, and B) I don't have one.
The epic is timeless, so he should still be clutching it.  I have no idea
what the background should be like, and perhaps it shouldn't have one, I can
always add one myself later.

Well, is that too entirely unreasonable?  I'd be willing to compensate said
artist for their time at a reasonable rate.  Doesn't matter if it's
hand-drawn or generated with Poser.  Just whatever can be managed.

Anyone have a good contact for that kind of stuff?  A good artist they might
be able to recommend?

Thanks.  =)
