  Well, yours is a reasonable question, despite what Mr. Uffmann says.
 From the media, it appears the Nigerian guy was not a terrorist, but
was rather pissed off  at the way his academic situation developed.
Point being IF he was a fundamentalist, he'd have killed people a long
time ago.  The fact that he targeted specific people, related to
academics, shows that he was no terrorist. Just an unlucky student
gone sour.  As for his religion -- well, unfortunately, only  his
family can answer that.
