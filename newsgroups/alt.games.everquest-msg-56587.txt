No kidding.  How many other classes have something so 'at their fingertips'
that they can make 50-100 pp a night at low levels?  I've never seen many
/oocs looking for a non-exp Revive or a Summon Corpse (50+).
Yup, them's the breaks.  'Course, it means a pause from quad-kiting or PLing
someone.

I was in EK the other night and the Warrior items were so rare that they
were outbidding each other for the *chance* to loot them.  I picked up
acouple of very mediocre items (would've been great if I were in my 20s);
uber-bard maces were dropping regularly; and not once did I hear about a
rogue piercer dropping.
We left several Wis-caster items for others to loot.
