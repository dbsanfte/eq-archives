This is long overdue.  My main is a wiz and I'll bind whenever I can
for free.  But there have been times when it's just not convenient to
travel across a whole zone.  FM comes to mind.  I hope they placed one
in the ruins but from the announcement I don't think they did.  I know
from the few minutes I was on earlier, Akanon's is inside near the
POD.  Didn't use him though so I have no info on details of how the
bind is done.
