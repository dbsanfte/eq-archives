I'd swear, they think it means Enraging Blow item and think only warriors 
ahve to worry about it.  But really, I think it's people who zone slow, 
accept a rez, and then go get a cup of coffee, and come back... still at 
their bind point.  Hm. :)

I've had that EB neck from Katta since time immemorial, and upgraded to a 
Lodi ring.  And I have three separate spells I can cast on myself for EB!  
I just don't see how people who can't cast it at all can -not- go get a 
simple item like that.

But then, I raid dispelling mobs without a decent clicky, so I'm in no 
position to talk, really. :)
