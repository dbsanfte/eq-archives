After much serious discussion, (and a fair amount of alcohol) myself and a
few friends have reactivated our Everquest accounts, and are giving the game
another spin for at least the next month., which leaves me with a few
questions and a comment.

I have LDoN, and the other two are almost certainly going to buy it.   Is
there any real reason to buy GoD at this point?    We will most likely not
be getting back into the raiding game, at least not on a serious basis.
What are the other benefits of GoD?    We're not maxed out on the "useful"
PoP AA's yet.   Are any of the GoD ones worth $30 and skipping ahead to get
them, like Improved Run Speed 4 and 5?     What about leadership abilities,
which I know almost nothing about, and can't even get the "purchase" menu
for?


I'm half flagged for elementals on each character, and the others have MB
and Trials, and not much more.  Is LDoN the only reasonable place to look
for gear, since it's unlikely we'll find a way to get elemental flagged, or
are there any other options that I should look at?

Is there anything significant about being a warrior or rogue that has
changed since PoP?


And for the comment.   For the first time I got a chance to use the warrior
taunt combat abilities (or whatever you want to call them.)  Kaev was most
definitely right.   These are obscenely overpowered.  Using no special
tactics other than the incite ability, my warrior was able to get and hold
aggro over a GoD geared paladin.  (My warrior was using an unagmented
"Taunting blow" hammer from the PoI dragon and a Primal warhammer.  The
paladin has 11k hp, and the "dreamers despair?" weapon... whatever that two
hand blunt is with the damage 20 points over the delay.  To give an idea of
the relative equipment levels involved.)

Those of you who keep going on about dumbing down the game by adding PoK
stones and sitting regen increases...  you really missed the boat on this
one. (No pun intended.)  _This_ is where the real dumbing down of the game
occured.   The only challenge of being a warrior, and grouping with one, was
aggro control.  That aspect of the game was put in serious jeporady with PoP
and the stunning paladins / dot'ing Sk's... and excised completely when the
warrior taunt abilites were introduced.   It makes combat insanely easy.

I may have benefitted from it... but it's a very poor solution to the
warrior aggro "problem."
