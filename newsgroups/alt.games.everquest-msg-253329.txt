I realize this, but there were other ways to fix this.  Some of which I
discussed on this very newsgroup.

Instead of adding an advantage to using a warrior that was equal to but
different from knights aggro abilities, so that each would have a use, they
instead gave the warrior equal aggro abilities.  The end result was twofold.
First, it made all three of the tank classes much more similar to each
other, when diversity would have been a better goal.  Second, it also had
the effect of making warriors into the preferred tank.  They now have equal
or better aggro abilities than the other two classes, plus other advantages,
greatly increased hit points and a small amount of natural mitigation.
Knowing pickup groups, right or wrong, the pendulum is going to swing the
other way now.   "Forget the knight, we need a warrior!"   Which isn't any
better of a situation, it's just a different group getting the short end of
the stick.

Which could have been compensated for in other, better ways.
