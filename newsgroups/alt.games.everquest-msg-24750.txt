In the 7/23/01 ASK BRAD column, Aradune had the following to say about 
character movement, which shows that a lot of the panic that resulted from 
the announcement was unwarranted.  (The portion I quote here is at the very 
end of the original post.)

Q: With the upcoming option to transfer your character to another server, 
do you think this will unbalance certain servers? What if multiple level 60 
characters are transferred to one of the newer servers and dominate the 
world?

A: They might, which is why we are limiting both transfers from old servers 
to newer servers as well as transfers to and from servers with disparate 
rule sets (for example, from PvP to non-PvP servers, and vice versa).  In 
other words, the servers will have to be of the same type and of similar 
ages in order for you to transfer characters there.
