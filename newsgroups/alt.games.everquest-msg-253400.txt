Thanks everyone. It had been so long since I last played (pre-luclin)
that now since I have all the expansions up to LDoN, I didn't realize
that the Riad window was part of an expansion, and not part of the new
UI.

Question though, If a group leader were to invite Duug (the warriors
name) into a group, would he show up in the Raid window for someone
that did have all the right expansions?
