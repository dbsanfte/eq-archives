Which is better, red wine or white? Some would say it depends if you're
serving beef or chicken.

You've gotten some other answers, but they really don't address it. What
is better depends entirely on the circumstances and what you're trying
to achieve. If all you are looking for is the maximum damage output,
with no care to anything else, then figure out how much damage the
weapons do and go with that.  *Usually* the two 1HS weapons will do more
if they are roughly equivalent in level. But of course a good two hander
will do more than two mediocre one handers. You can download Copeland's
weapons analyzer off the web and figure out how much average damage per
minute you will do with any weapon or combination of weapons.

However, there will be times when you will be more concerned with taunt
than raw damage. In the later levels, if you are the Main Tank, you want
to hold the mob's aggro and stay on top of the hate list. This may
sometimes mean using two lower damage, but faster weapons (maybe even
with a hate inducing proc) to hold the mob's attention, and forgoe a
better 2 hander that might do more damage but is slower and generates
less hate. Conversely, if you are *not* the tank, you don't want to be
distracting the mob off the MA and on to youself, so you may opt for the
big damage, but slower two hander to not get its attention.

Judge each situation on its own merits.
