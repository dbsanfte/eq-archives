I "do not" mean PLing; I mean grouping and gaining XP within the normal
confines of the game. My reason for doing this is that I am currently at
level 31 and my Guildies are almost all at 50+. I would rather "enjoy the
journey" and do more quests/adventuring, but most of my friends in the game
are very high level and I want to get there as quick as possible so I can
group and adventure with them. I am sure there are other players who are at
a place where they would like to "level-up" as fast as possible, also. So I
will take all the suggestions I get here and consolidate it into one post as
a "Best Zones for Fast XP".

An example would be for someone to post that in their opinion Paludal
Caverns is the best zone for fast leveling from level 18 to 26. Personally,
that's where I spent those levels and I can't imagine another zone giving
more insane XP at those levels than Paludal. I have spent 26 to 31 in High
Keep and the XP has rolled in pretty good, but nowhere near the rate at
Paludal. Things to take into account are not only the XP bonus for dungeons,
but the availability and quality of mobs, layout of zone, availability of
other players to group with, etc. For example, one of the great things about
High Keep is the availability of other players. There is always plenty of
peeps there (sometimes too many) to group with. If a dungeon gave great XP
with great availability of quality mobs, but was devoid of PC's to group
with, it was useless. Permafrost is like this on my server.

So bring on your ideas and let's get a complete guide together. Thanks in
advance.
