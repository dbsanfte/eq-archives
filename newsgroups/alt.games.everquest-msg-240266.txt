Why not? Jealousy is a bitch, eh? The golfing industry, for example,
is a multi-billion dollar industry that keeps a lot of people working.
If you resign yourself to the fact that you live in a capitalistic
system, or maybe you don't and endure the system of Red China, then
there is no reason some bright entrepenaur shouldn't get rich
providing services to supplement the game. Just be that guy, nobody is
stopping you but yourself.
