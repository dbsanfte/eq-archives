I hate corpse runs.  I mean, truely hate them.  Especially ones that involve
a boatride, and perhaps waiting for daylight in Kithcor, then the EK mozey,
and then the long march through WK to finally get to your corpse.  Had to do
that a few times (the first three times were unsuccessful CR's) when I was
bound in Felwithe and decided to go to Qeynos.  Sorry, but that just isn't
my idea of fun.

So, yes, I do feel the need to be bound somewhere near where I'm fighting.
That makes the Soulbinders a great addition.  As far as the caster who think
it's only right that pure casters are the only ones who get to bind, I
disagree.  It's not exactly a class defining spell.  Six classes get it.
That makes it an advantage to no one, but a disadvantage to those who must
beg for a bind.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
