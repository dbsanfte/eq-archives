I've had this thought that I could start an automated process
(part of my job at home, batch processing a series of Word docs
with some VB routines I wrote--completely unrelated to EQ)
and while my little buddy is droning away, I can play EQ.

However, EQ seems to want to grab huge chunks of
memory and processor time--90-95% and a peak of
around 150MB on my 256MB 1.2Ghz WinBook running
WinXP, as reported by the Task Manager.

Are there safe techniques for limiting memory usage
and processor time? I'm playing a lev51 wiz going
mostly solo, so it's nuke and sit, nuke and sit. This
sort of hurry-up-and-wait pattern would be aided
by being able to change these parameters on the fly,
as a sort of mode or state change. When sitting, I don't
see much happening other than the bars creeping,
so why not use the machine for more of something
else, and then go full-throttle when get up for a nukefest?

Any thoughts?

Regards,
Chris
