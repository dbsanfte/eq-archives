Trying out new group combos is fun!
I remember being in a group consisting of:

3 Wizards (crowd control, stuns, roots, nukes)
1 Beastlord (tank & healer... hehe)
1 Rogue (backstabs)

We had little downtime because the wizards would stun mobs so they wouldnt
deal much damage to our tank, rooting adds out of the way, and nuking the
living crap outta mobs. We owned the zone. Infact this group has been one of
the best grouping experiences i have had. It was exciting, fun and
untraditional.
