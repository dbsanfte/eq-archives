Thats quite true, but then root has its own advantage; rooted mobs can be
softened up with DOTs while waiting their turn, in fact my favorite druid in
the game is also the best mezzer I know, consistently pulling in half a dozen
mobs at a time and leaving them lined up while we kill one after another.. by
the time we get to the last mob its almost dead!

From previous conversations, though, my cleric is now a mezer for tight
quarters; root, pacify, atone... its sloppy, but that mob stands still, then
forgets it was mad at you, and has its aggro range reduced so low that you can
pretty much stand on it without reminding it!

PoP zones, particularly low end PoP zone camps, are outdoors with quite a bit
of room for root style mezzing.
