*** Patch Information ***


- Fixed a problem with Alternate Advancement ability 
Combat Fury that was causing rangers using archery 
and rogues using throwing to have a lesser chance 
to critical than normal.  This did not affect warriors

- We think we've fixed many of the issues that were 
causing 1018 errors.  At the very worst players should 
be able to log back in faster now

- Fixed a problem that was causing quests to give no 
Alternate Experience to a character when that character 
had all experience going into their Alternate Experience pool

- Fixed a bug that was causing Claw of the Savage Spirit, 
Earthen Band and Breastplate of Day to show a negative 
statistic modifier

- Fixed an issue with some ATI-based video cards that was 
causing the inventory screen to flash

- All Levitation spells will now be stripped when 
entering a no-levitation zone.  There was a bug that 
caused the game to only strip the first Levitation spell
found

- Earrings of Endless Speed are now no-drop

- Fixed a bug that was displaying erroneous and duplicate 
faction messages

- Also added some Tradeskill recipes for items 
dropping in Akheva and Maidens eye

- Tradeskills (including Alchemy and poison) now 
take %skill modifying items and buffs into consideration

- Scallywag's Arm Plates (Legends Only) are now wearable 
in the arms slot (was errantly flagged for the chest slot)

- All soft wicker pieces are now wearable by Beastlords


** A Tale **

Prime Heirophant Vek leaned over and looked into the 
jeweled case silently.  The young mystic behind him 
nervously fingered the cudgel hanging from his belt.  He 
knew what was coming.  The hold of the faceless had 
firmly taken hold of his heart and was beginning to squeeze.

Vek turned to him quietly and simply said, "Find them."  
He then walked silently out of the room.

Hierophant Zand turned to the young Mystic, "Do as he 
has asked.  Do not return until you have the skulls of 
the ancients in your possession."  The young Mystic 
stumbled as he ran out of the room, visibly shaking.

Zand looked down into the empty skull case.  Something 
glittered softly in the corner of the case.  Zand 
reached in and picked up a small earring, emblazoned 
with the symbol of the Kunzar.

Zand walked quietly out of the room, and somewhere 
the soul of a dead emperor laughed with unholy malice.


** Another Tale **
** Another Tale **

Halor slashed frantically at the creature before him.  
He swung down hard, cleaving the great worm in two.  
Unfortunately there were many more were that came from.  
Bauric climbed over a rock and stood next to Halor, 
fighting off another of the worms.

Halor suddenly felt a sharp pain in his right heel and 
spun violently around, causing his journals to fly out 
of his pack and onto the hard stone floor.  He swung at the 
worm larva with his sword knocking it away, but too late.  
The worm had wounded him badly, he could no longer hold 
himself up on the wounded ankle and he fell to the floor 
with a crash.  Bauric cried out in pain as one of the 
larger worms bit into his arm.  That was the last thing 
Halor saw before the horde of worms squirmed across the
 stones and overcame them.
