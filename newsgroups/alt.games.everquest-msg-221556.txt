Charisma makes no appreciable difference on fizzles ("missed
notes"), which you can easily check by doing a long run of hard
to sing songs with normal gear, then with two of those 25 cha
steins and a nice enourmous cha buff from a neighborhood shaman;
while its hard to see changes with 10 points in any given stat, a
swing of over 100 points should make a detectable difference
pretty quickly.

Charisma helps a bit with charm duration and with avoiding aggro
on lull failure.  That said, my vah shir bard hasn't ever had any
complaints despite using charm extremely heavily for about 32
levels, and he didn't put any points into charisma nor has he
made any effort to assemble charisma gear, although a fair amount
of bard gear does have cha on it.  I think in his "fighting kit"
he has a 110 cha, if he's called on to lull he gets out the
steins and jumps up to 130 or so... not because he's noticed a
difference but because bad lulls are bad enough that even a good
luck charm will be considered.

Dex... well I don't honestly know if it helps with missed notes
either.  Never noticed any difference myself, but they just
aren't all that prevalent and rarely annoy me much.  Dex helps
with procs, which is handy if you happen to be swinging proccing
weapons... but bard melee output is so tragic that I rarely
bother, plus I'm often very busy.

As with every other class, stamina is the best of a fairly
useless lot of stats.  You -could- make a case for int, but mana
pool... well I've said it a hundred times before, but mana pool
doesn't mean much, its how fast you get the mana back, not how
much you start with, that matters; and you've got the answer to
that one, a solstice earring literally doubles your standing mana
regen and increases your sitting regen by a third, to get that
effect with my cleric I'd need FT 15!

But your stamina will matter even less for your bard than it does
for your ranger; at least your ranger can do real damage in a toe
to toe fight, and frankly rangers aren't -that- bad at taking a
hit either, if it comes to that, while bards are best played at a
respectable distance from harms way, and tank about as well as a
cleric (but probably have half the HP)

So I say, stop worrying about your stats, as with most classes,
they really mean very little in the short -or- long run.

Llyric, 57 Vah Shir Bard, Morel-Thule

ps: oh, unless you have the cash lying around for a Lute of the
Howler, go do the vah shir bard newbie quests... one of the
results is a primary slot weildable string instrument.  This
means you can dual weild and still drop the string in on the beat
for massive boost to healsong output without complex juggling. 
You'll want to hang on to a secondary slot string too, because
sometimes you'll be juggling in the normal "off hand" slot
instead, but the primary slot sure is handy and its the very best
thing about being a Vah Shir bard... plus not many people know it
exists since most bards are twinks and skip the newbie quests.
