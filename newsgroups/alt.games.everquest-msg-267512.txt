True enough. I doubt McQuaid et. al. really knew when designing EQ that it
would be as successful as it is so I doubt they would have named it
Everquest *1* not knowing if it would be a commercial success. But
*Everquest* 2 also shares the name regardless of how *you* try to argue it.
I really could care less if it splits or if people note their threads. I
enjoyed my time and EQ and continued to lurk here and am enjoying EQ2 and
will continue to lurk here - and post if I feel the need regardless of how
the thread topic looks.

I haven't committed a crime. What I did was fail to comply with the law.
