I'm saying that monks were too good at tanking in experience groups before
the patch and anyone saying they weren't don't know what they are talking
about.

I didn't have to play a monk to figure that out.

Those numbers were for real meaning exactly what they said - and let me tell
you , playing a ranger you were really aware of what those numbers meant.

The quote on ranger vs monk was what I also experienced.

But when they change monks to the level of other classes a lot of spoiled
monks starts yelling - NERF
