I used my own Credit Card for Legends and its worht every penny I play from
1-6am PST if I need a GM he is there. I have needed GMs on Prexus during
those hours and never seen one till the next day. I do think it sucks to
have to spend extra for service that should have been there all along.
Unfortuneatly I have yet to see a Legends weapon or item yet. I have been on
several GM events at those times though.
