Yes, I fixed your annoying top post too.

    Bluntly, spend 8 months of your own time figuring it out then come talk to
me about there isn't one. To be honest, I hear all the time passing through SK
that Quillmane is a random pop, etc, etc... it ain't. PERIOD.

    It isn't a ph perse` either, more of a cycle, and if you do a bit more
homework you may actually find that alot of supposed banter about what it might
be is near correct, and even dead on in a few instances, on all those mage
boards you mentioned. Forgive me for not wanting the Quill pop to be overcamped
just for the lev effect when alot of mages DO need the drop for their epic. 79
kills of that bitch horse, 28 drops, and I kept one. Never sold an MQ, and never
let one rot:
/gu If ya need a Pegasus Feather Cloak and can get to SK in 7 minutes, meet me
at loc *whatever*
--no takers-- /ooc If yer a mage take off anon or role and come to loc
*whatever* to get yer Pegasus Feathered Cloak.
--no takers-- /ooc Pegasus Feather Cloak at loc *whatever* for whoever wants it.

15 minute time frame every 6 hours in game, if the horse dies fast enough there
can be up to 5 pops during that time. Each of which relies on the 'ph', more
like cycle, being done properly in the prior 6 hours. If yer a mage on bertox
that needs to know and wont give it all away post a reply with yer character
name in it and I will shoot ya a tell in game, providing yer not on anon or
role, and would be happy to tell you, or even show you.
