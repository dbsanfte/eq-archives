Why, how nice, TwoHead. :)

I imagine I might dabble. :) I have a pretty full plate right now... but who
knows what the future holds.

I try to treat people as I wish they would treat me, as I have said before,
until sufficiently provoked. (LOL-for the 'after sufficiently provoked' see
the FA NG... *eg*). But I never bite first, turn the other cheek til both
are sore, and try to have fun, no matter WHAT I am playing.

Thanks for the kind words and the compliment.

I am sure we will run into each other in the EQ realm... hehe.
