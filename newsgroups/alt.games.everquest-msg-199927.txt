I took a small break from EQ for a few months, but as always, the itch
for exploring Norrath again has returned. I was able to install the
game and download all of the patches without a hitch. (Original EQ,
Ruins of Kunark, Scars of Velious, Shadows of Luclin, and Planes of
Power)

The trouble starts after the patcher finishes scanning for files. When
I get the seisure warning screen, the text is blinking. (about once a
second) Also, the Licence screen, the text within the buttons on the
Connect, Accounts, Credits, Exit screen, the text on the login screen,
and the text on the server select screen also all blinks at the same
rate. I am able to get past each screen normally, but once I get to
the character select screen, the character begins to turn for about 3
seconds before the computer freezes and I need to hit the reset
button. (Ctrl, Alt, Del do nothing)

Before I took my break, I was able to log in fine and play. Since
then, I have reformatted my computer and reloaded all of my software.
(Windows 2000) My hardware has not changed since.

To fix this problem I have tried the following things:
 - The first thing I did was to go to the main EQ website and browse
through the FAQ and Knowledge base for similar problems to mine. The
only thing that came close said that this problem is usually caused by
outdated drivers for some specific video cards, none of which I have.
(Matrox Millennium G400 DualHead) But however I checked the Matrox
site for up to date drivers just to find out that I already have the
most recent one for my card and Windows 2000. Incidently, it was the
same driver that I was using when I was playing EQ before my break.
 - Install DirectX 9. When this doesn't work, following the suggestion
of a friend, I uninstalled it and installed DirectX 8.1. This has not
worked either.
 - Disabled hardware acceleration for my video card. When I did this,
EQ would not even start and gave me an error message saying there was
no 3D device found. The setting is on a sliding scale. Setting it to
all of the positions between full hardware acceleration and no
hardware acceleration does not change anything.
 - Disabled my sound card. I had read other posts on the Internet that
when some games freeze, disabling the sound card temporarily fixed the
problem until the soundcard manufacturer develops drivers for the
latest version of DirectX. This had no effect.
 - Tried renaming the eqclient.ini file to eqclient.old.ini. I
expected the patcher to provide me with a fresh version of the file,
but from what I can see, EQ was able to load without it.

So now I'm stuck with a reactivated account and nothing to use it
with. Since Monday is Memorial Day, the earliest I can reach Sony
Technical Support is Tuesday. I really do not want to have to deal
with them, so I am hoping that someone here has had a similar problem
and can either provide a solution or point me in the right direction
to a resource that can provide a solution.

Thanks in advance all!
