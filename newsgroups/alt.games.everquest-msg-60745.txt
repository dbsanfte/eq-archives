Hmm, seems to be the way some of the guilds are going.  I guess that I'm
lucky, in the fact that I'm the lowest level member of a small guild.  It's
rather easy to get people to go raid something, just becasue.  That, and
almost the entire guild is KOS in Freeport anyways, which means convincing
them to do a Lucan raid won't be too hard.
