Eh, I guess I must not be running around The Overthere at the right
time on my server, because I usually see like 12-15 people in the zone
at once.  I just assume they're either already full or content groups
or a bunch of soloers/power levellers.  I'd rather not waste my time in
finding out what's really going on, though.  =/

I thought they had all gone to like LoY zones or something since LoY's
supposed to be a 30-60 range expansion, but I was wrong again.
