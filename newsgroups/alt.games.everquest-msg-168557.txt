He's a pansy.  AE is damage and snare... since you don't plan to run away snare
isn't much of an issue.  His damage output is low enough that we don't even use a
Cheal chain on the MA, group two clerics with him (one for MA and one for the
rest of the group including MA cleric) and don't worry about it.  The AE damage
is the killer, as he procs a couple, something that does 800 damage (the snare?)
and something else that does 300... comes out a LOT.

Apparantly some of this damage is front only, so staying behind him helps a lot.
More important, IMO is keeping people close together, so that group heals can hit
them all.  While apparantly you can use walls to hide from the AOE, its so
frequent that staying out of sight and popping out between rounds isn't a
realistic plan, what this does is slow down your damage output and put you out of
group heal range.

Perhaps the most effective group heal is Ethereal Elixer, which slaps a Celestial
Elixer on everyone in your group.  This means people not quite hurt enough for
full effect from word of restoration are still getting full measure, since they
will inevitably be hurt more during the duration.

First time we did this, we were scattered and I lost half my party as well as
going very close to OOM.  Second time, getting people to stay close to me (and me
to the dragons tail end) I didn't lose a single person, and had so much mana that
at the end of the fight I threw in a couple Condemnations to help speed the kill.

DPS is of course the key to this sort of fight, the faster the mob dies the less
damage your group takes.  This is a lesson we learned on Trakanon, and it often
serves well.  Well here, the AOE's are such that you can easily end up losing
people in droves, and the more you lose, the lower your DPS and the more you
lose.  So healing EVERYONE is very important.

This second time was my first run thru as raid leader, by the way.  Cleric and
raid leader mixes even less well than cleric and group leader, in my opinion...
but on the other hand, it was fun to be in charge, particularly ordering my guild
leader around.
