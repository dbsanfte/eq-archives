Being a 40th season Iksar Shammy, I am still currently wearing most of my
Scaled Mystic.  The quests are not that hard for your level.  The hardest
will probably be the little fella in FoB underwater tunnel (I had a level 50
necro friend take him out for me).  With the exception of finding that damn
Froglok in swamp - most pieces were easy to get at 25 with a group or
partner.
