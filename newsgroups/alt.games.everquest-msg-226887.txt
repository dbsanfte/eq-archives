Error one:  Warrior puller.  Warrior gets three... why not?  I mean, 
he's got absolutely NO tool for pulling singles, even my mage can do 
better at it (by using a no damage spell like cancel magic to minimize 
adds).  Not that a warrior can't pull, heck, happens all the time.  But 
if things are difficult, you use what you can to make them as easy as 
you can manage.

Shaman failing to play secondary healer; Cheal means patch heals if its 
getting close.  RNG spike on a damage output this large, though, could 
have meant death anyway.

Nuke and Root don't really mix all that well, as nukes break roots with 
appalling frequency.  Staying out of "ack he's coming for me" range of 
mobs you are nuking really ought to be second nature for a 65 wizard.

Warrior should have been most of the way back to the mission by this 
point, although with a 65 cleric I'd assume there's a clicky rez, and 
the warrior has no mana to worry about, so clicking him really was the 
way to go, ASAP.  No reason to sit and assume its going to happen 
though, if there's mobs in camp might be the warrior would show up just 
in time to save you all.

Rezing the wizard, though, big mistake.  Wizard should be looking 
quickly around for KEI if possible, then using a combination of port, 
succor, and his run 3 feet (its a 65 wizard he'd best have Run 3) to get 
back under his own power; rez kills any chance at KEI and all the mana 
in his pool.

Did the cleric lull before someone pulled?  If not, still not enough 
respect, now that you know three of them can take you down to the 
stockyards and turn you in to slabs of long pig for the barbeque.

Shaman was on the backup healer job this time, pity that his slow plus 
patch put him over the top of the aggro heap; this is the sort of thing 
we talk about when we say that warrior's lack of real aggro production 
is crippling to other members of their groups.  Slowed mob that can kill 
a shaman with quiescence on before he can get a root off, thats pretty 
scary though any way you look at it.

Yep, once more root and nuke aren't a good combination

You don't mention, but I'm guessing Ranger and Cleric zone out?

Unless I'm misunderstanding your story, thats 5: warrior, wizard in 
first trio, then shaman, warrior, wizard this time.  Or you might mean 
"people who have died" in which case its only 3, the warrior and wizard 
died twice each.

What's the warrior's objection to root?  Its his best friend, puts mobs 
stationary where he can beat on them to his satisfaction before calling 
for assist.  If nobody nukes or comes in melee range until he does, he 
really ought to be able to get the aggro under control.

Seven.  Or four (cleric added to the roll call of people who have died, 
and warrior gets a 3 next to his name)

Fun times!  Shortly after every release I'm always getting into messes 
like this one, its part of the joy of exploring something new. 
Surprised you waited this long to post about it, though, thats half the 
joy for me, and I'm much more likely to write up a disaster like this 
than a walk in the park successful run.
