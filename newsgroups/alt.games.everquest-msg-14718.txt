There's a third side to it. You can't always know if what you are doing 
is an exploit. Definition of exploiting changes just about daily. I've 
never known that buffing in the prep-room next to Vox is an exploit. 
Yet, according to Brad, it is. According to Brad, running out of the 
Nagafen's room to get healed can also be considered an exploit.
I used to use a simple strategy to level at some point. I found non-
aggro stationary monsters (brutes by Dalnir). I'd beat them down a bit 
with my monk, feign, get up, bandage a bit, and continue fighting. At 
some point a GM looked at it, said that I'm exploiting, and told me to 
stop.
