K.I.S.S.

IMO, the less things you're giving out points for the better.  Any time I
hear the words "bonus points," I get a small involuntary twitch.   What we
did was have a set number of points per kill, loosely based on the time it
should take to do the raid.   Pure time based works as well.     If signups
and showing up on time is a problem for your guild, imo the only real
solution is to start leaving people behind, just go ahead and begin the raid
the moment you have enough people to win.    (And be sure to congratulate
the winners with links, especially if its an item thier class can use.)
People do tend to get the message suprisingly fast.  And once they realize
thier loot chance is at stake, they suddenly find ways to show up on time.

Thats a minor nitpick with your system, though.

This sounds like the real problem of your proposed system to me.

First it sounds wide open for abuse.   A warrior with 200 points built up
bids on an item, the second he does, a shadowknight who rarely plays, and
only has 5 points says "hmmm...  if I "want" that too, he spends 200
points... if I don't, he only loses the 10 points from this raid.   I bid on
that 5 hp upgrade!"   Anyone without a lot of points can play spoiler if
they want to.

It encourages the heavy raiders to loot whore small or even lateral
upgrades, even if they would rather save up thier points for significant
upgrades, since being 100 points higher than the next guy isn't any better
than being 2 points higher.
