They all do? I just noticed my Iksar is standing as if even the grass
under him was hostile. Then again, most things are hostile to an Iksar..

What irritates me more, is that I soemtimes see most people having their weapon
straight through them when sitting. Or a ponytailed female pally with her hair
stuck in the armour. Ah well .. layering issues.
