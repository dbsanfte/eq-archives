It would have to be a pretty sophisticated system.  Often half the group 
passes on an item (int casters not caring much about a +dex item for 
example) so you'd want to allow for that.  Sometimes people even roll for 
fun, decide after the roll to give an item to someone else, or roll on 
behalf of an alt.  

Every LDoN group I have been in had a master looter who then sold any gems 
and split the cash with the group.  Sometimes someone would want a gem as 
part of their loot and would pay the group an agreed upon price.  
Automating that would certainly make things easier for players if it could 
be done, but I'm not sure it can be done in a way that keeps things fair 
since the game doesn't govern the going price on items.  

One possibility would be to put enough of each item on the mob so that 
everyone gets one, and automatically deposit them in everyone's inventory 
at the moment the mob dies.  That's the way quest loot works in some games, 
isn't it?
