I have Planes of Power and Lost Dungeons installed on my computer. I then
purchased Evolution. I removed PoP and LDoN from my computer, then installed
Evolution and everything went ok, but on a different account. I installed
LDoN, tried to set up account, but instead received a message say that the
account key has already been used. Yes it has, by me. Is there anything I
can do?
