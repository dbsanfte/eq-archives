Stopped by SKarana to obliterate my old nemesis Sentry Alechin once
for old time's sake now that I am level 54. That bastich was the bane
of my existence for the entire time levels 20-30 that I spent in that
zone.

I spotted him in the distance and /conned just for laughs, then spent
the next five minutes trying to pick my jaw up off the floor...

Someone explain to me how an iksar necromancer who follows Cazic-Thule
can have a human paladin who follows the god(s) of love regard him as
an ally?
