There's an NPC in a room behind Tormax in Kael (Something the
Armormaster I think) who trades some no-graphic helms for graphic helms.
Hand him the helm, he hands you back a new helm.

Warlord's Helm changes to Custom Warlord's Helm for example

Kael quest helms, Cowl of Mortality, and I think Dain/Tormax Crowns can
be turned in, but there may be more
