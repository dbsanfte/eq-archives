Please refrain from using HTML to post here, standard etiquette on Usenet
discourages HTML posts.

On to your question...

You'll have to move EQUI_*.xml files around in your /everquest/uifiles/
directories to get all the features that you want in the same custom ui
directory (say, /uifiles/RogonUI) then type "/loadskin RogonUI 1" in game to
get all the features you want, on one UI.

Thats the basic gist of it, there's better guides on the web at some of the
UI sites, but I don't have them available offhand.
