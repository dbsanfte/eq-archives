I am also having this problem. Almost everytime I go to a new zone I
get kicked out. Once I've been there once during a gaming session,
then I can go back and forth with no problems. If I quit the game and
return, then goto the same zone, I will be booted again. I would
really like to figured this one out. any ideas?
