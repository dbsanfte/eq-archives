Because some of us prefer it that way ;) Because that is how it has always
been for Rangers in EQ. People are utterly bamboozled by the 'POP' effect
of EP bows bought before EP weapons are available into thinking archery
outdamages melee.

I can think of no stage of the game where a comparable archery/melee setup
(rather than say, a bazaar bought EP bow vs epics) will consistently and
significantly outdamage melee. It gets very close at 65 with AM3/EQ while
in the EP's vs EP weaponry with all combat AA's, but prior to that it is
no contest, and post that event it is no contest.

People just dont know what they're talking about, mostly. I'm happy being
a choppy slicey ranger. Maybe if the incredible myth of 'OMGZ0R ranger DPS
pwnS bozwzer' we can see the twink legions go back to playing rogues again
and all will be well with the world ;)
