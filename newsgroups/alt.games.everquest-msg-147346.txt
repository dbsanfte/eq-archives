Well, everywhere I went today on the web I see small remembrances to
9/11.  Ebay, Hotmail, Paypal, Netscape, every site has a little
something...
ALL BUT FUCKEN EQ!!
Not one word, not one stinking little banner. Nothing.
I'm sure that out off the thousands of people that died that day  at
least one of them must have been a regular player on EQ.
I know for a fact that some firemen spend long boring nights playing
EQ ( I personally knew 2 that did).

I know some of you play to forget ( not sure if that's good or bad )
but they should at least have a little something.

I log on..hmmm no message..ok maybe in game...select server... load
charater...whats the message of the day at 1:00pm EST:

your account info updated, especially if you've just moved or

WHAT???

Yeah, Make fucking sure we can bill you, but fuck the dead.
Just another day I guess for Verant.

I'm guessing that maybe later on they might so some fuckin' heart and
post something if enough people complain how heartless they are.
I called those Verant pricks and gave them a good New York beating
over the phone. I hope more people do.. Unamerican fucks.
