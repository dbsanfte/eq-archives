In my limited experience with this group, "fools" is a lightweight epithet.
I agree that it is uncalled for, as I feel all the name calling and abuse is
uncalled for and non-productive.  Constructive commentary is always more
pleasant than destructive.  Unfortunately, we cannot all seem to remember
that all the time.  Even I stoop to the occasional satirical comment.
Perhaps forgive and forget are the best we can hope for.

Cheers,
Eric
