One of my best friends in game is a level 25 wizard. He's a real nice guy, 
and 
tends to spend a lot of time helping other people, and not working on 
levelling. On top of that he has some really bad luck! :-) I want to help 
him 
gain a few levels so he can (1) finally get group TP's and (2) safely group 
with his friends who have mostly gotten to the low 30's.

My main is a level 39 monk who is currently in Crystal Caverns. My plan was 
originally to bring him to CC, and have him group with me while I kill orc 
miners, watchmen, etc. They would all be red to him, but green to low blue 
to 
me. I wasn't gonna have him do anything besides sit there invis and NOT die. 
:-) This was my plan while he was still level 26, which he lost on Saturday 
after dieing way too many times in the Queynos Catacombs. So, now he is 
level 
25, and can't get exp with me until I get him to 26. He's currently in South 
Karana.

So, first of all I need suggestions to get him to 26 as safely and quickly 
as 
possible. I really don't want to go all the way back to Kunark so something 
on 
Antonica would be good. If I can find some nice high 20's mobs, I can feign 
dead PL him to 26. Then maybe group with him and kill low 30's mobs. Or take 
him to CC.

Anyone have any other ideas? I'd really like to help him out.
