Oh yeah, don't forget to get yourself some of that +5WIS food from
Stonebrunt. Need to trade chocolate cherries for it (brownie parts and Marr
Cherries). If you don't want to make the food, you could probably buy it
pretty cheap. Just keep it in your first food slot and you get the +5WIS. If
you continue to force feed yourself other food before you get hungry, you
will never eat the Catnip (the +5WIS food).
