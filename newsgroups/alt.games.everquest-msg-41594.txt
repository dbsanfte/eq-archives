A further thought on the "its your ISP" issue:

Since the Guide a petitioner is talking to about the problem is also
sitting in their own home connecting just as any other user they have a
pretty simple way of telling if its an internal or external problem.  If
its internal they are having the problem as well in most cases, whereas
if they have no sign of problem on their connection the odds of the
problem being related to a central VI network issue are greatly
reduced.  Since different zones are on different physical servers this
logic assumes that the guide has visited the zone the player is  in to
be sure that its not a zone specific issue.  In retort to those who will
undoubtedly say that the Guide responded too fast to have visited the
zone I will  point out that if your petition states you are having a
problem with connectivity and the petition shows you were in zone XYZ
when you petitioned a good Guide would visit the zone before even saying
hello.
