Why?  I have this feeling that those are the exact levels I personally 
would thoroughly have regretted PLing through.  Maybe not up to 40... but 
40-50 is where I learned a -lot- about how to be an enchanter, and being a 
50 chanter was very very different from being a 40 chanter...

I suppose it depends on whether you want really really badly to be a 50 
chanter, or you want really really badly to be a decent 50 chanter.  Do 
you need 50 just for some one particular use, and then you're going to 
dispose of the character?

Or, it's always possible that you already know everything and will have 
instant mastery of high level chanterhood with no practice whatsoever.  
Who knows.  If you insist, though, the other followup looked like it had 
good ideas.

I'm not trying to say it's rocket science, but I do think that practice 
makes a big difference.  And PLing doesn't really count as practice, 
because you only do it in one place.  What really seems to make a 
difference is being a chanter in a whole bunch of different situations.
