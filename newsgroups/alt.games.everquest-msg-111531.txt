My druid rarely has it up if he's outdoors unless he's hunting.  A friend
ALWAYS has it up even when just traveling.  It's my opinion that if you're
traveling, the snare/sow combo is plenty to keep you alive.  I kept trying
to talk her into casting her lower level root because of the casting time,
but she kept refusing because of the max root time.

Until she died because she couldn't get her 2.5 second Root off fast enough.
