Welcome to Everquest. :)

First off, before I forget, Daniel James said that he wouldn't choose a
"wizard," but I think he meant to say "human."  Humans tend to have about
the worst starting stats, but many people still like to play them anyway.

www.allakhazam.com is a good resource (used to be a great one)...if you
don't mind annoying pop-up ads.

http://eq.castersrealm.com is another good resource...it has a spell list
and describes what each spell does and where you can buy it.  Wizard
teleports (over all) aren't as convenient as druid, but even 2nd best is
better than running or taking the boat! <g>  You can start porting yourself
to select zones at level 20, porting full groups at level 29, and porting
individuals (TL or translocation) single people at 39.

Quite honestly, if you're looking to make money teleporting don't expect to
get rich doing it.  With the game this mature a  lot of people are going to
have sources of free ports.  STILL, there WILL always be a market for
porting...like I said before, just don't expect to become rich doing it.
