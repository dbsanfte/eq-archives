Ignore Int, completely.
Get up to the bazaar and search for halfling/druid/wis items.
Depending on the server, you might be able to find some damn nice
things for fairly cheap (relative to your level, of course).
Also check allakhazam.com for any quests you can do. Some have
nice rewards.
From what I know of druids (little, admittedly), you will soon stop
meleeing, so don't really worry about the dmg/dly on your weapon,
more on the stats.
