Opps!  Shows how much I've played pet-classes!  I was under the (mistaken)
impression that it was much less than that.

Still, if the down time is minimized to almost nil, and you're in a good
spawn cycle where you can just kill, kill, kill, and keep it under control,
then I would still think that with even that much of a penalty, it would
still be worth it.

The worst part would be getting too heavy of loot, and having to zone to
sell it, or going around terribly encumbered, or letting good loot rot for
the sake of keeping an excellent pet alive.
