Quite simple really. The weapon uses as 'fuel' a highly volatile and
fast decaying 'mana', the specific type of which is only found on mobs.
The hammer 'extracts' a random amount from the mob on each swing, and
when it reaches critical mass, the sword fires off, teleporting to to
Overthere.

Or maybe there's just a note in the smallprint when you bought the
hammer: Agitate thoroughly before use

Or maybe the hammer creates ripples in the fabric of Norrath,
occasionally strong enough for you to 'surf' to OT, but only when you're
actually hitting something

Out of character for the game world? Maybe, but easy as pie to explain
away if you believe in 'ressurections' going to clerics and paladins
rather than shaman who unarguably have far more real world history of
claiming to 'raise the dead' than any christian/catholic modelled
'priest' who would simply recite a eulogy over your corpse about what a
'nice guy' you were and how you're 'in a better place now'.

The whole point of the hammer is that it's unreliable. I was on an early
Trak raid and got ported to shrooms at a time where CR would've been a
real pain. I whipped out the hammer and prayed, and luckily got a proc
off before I died. Next time I tried it ended in CR.

There is also a VERY IMPORTANT FACT that you are ignoring. Melees have
ZERO channelling skill. Any slight hit from a mob, AE hitting you, or
even a bump from a fellow player, will interrupt you. And if you're in a
fight, you can completely forget any hope of drinking a gate potion. The
hammer at least gives a CHANCE of getting a proc off during a fight, but
without being as overpowering as an unlimited rightclick instaclick
teleport item.
