You cut and pasted quotes from 2 different conversations.. go you!

You talked some shit about monks, hence I question if you've ever seen a
real monk at work. To think any old gimp sk, necro or bard will outperform
them.. well that tells me you haven't.

Then somebody asks about the monk board, and you reply with some bullshit
about secret handshakes because OMG, theres a high-end board talking about
high-end situations.. which requires high-end participation to join.
