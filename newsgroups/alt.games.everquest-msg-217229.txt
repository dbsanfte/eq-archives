I tried the new human models for approximately 15 minutes before
switching them all back, go go Forest Gump leaning forward running
anim.  Not a single Iksar I've ever met likes the new models and as
for the Erudites well two or three days of constant forehead cracks
was enough to make them switch back too.

Verant/SoE even acknowleged that the SoL revamped models hadn't ended
up as they had envisioned them (corporate speak for "crap") due to
time constraints.
