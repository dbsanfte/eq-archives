Oh, I'm not saying we suck for soloing or anything, but I still think the
necro beats us in dps, has as little downtime and gets less dizzy from
running in circles. With the best droppable drum (3.0 mod) and all the
instrument AA you peak at around 200*4 + 100 per tick from doing 4 oow chants
and assonance (the 1 minute duration slow/dot). That's around 150 dps, and
I think necros in bazaar gear gets better sustained dps easily.

In the higher end the bard derives a minuscle benefit from reaching the
extra .4 mod at the cap compared to what the necro gains from focii.

As an aside though, Fire is so last year. MPG chant kiting is much more fun,
for 11% AA per kill.
