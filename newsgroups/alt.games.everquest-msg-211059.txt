More like they finally caved in to the hordes of whiners about twinking
or woke up to the fact that a L1 char with a 35/30 weapon wasn't really
such a good idea after all. Personally I think recommended level should
have been in the game from the beginning. They always claimed that
higher end items had hidden reduction in effectiveness, the recommended
level stuff just makes those reductions visable. 

As to the earned part, oh well. Unless you looted it from the corpse
it's arguable that you earned it in the way you're implying anyway.
Somehow I don't really view farming spider silks or whatever as earning
that 14/23 dagger with 5% backstab that drops of a L59 mob in a dungeon
you wouldn't survive 5 ft inside the door in. In that dagger's example,
you can still fully use it at a mere L51 anyway.
