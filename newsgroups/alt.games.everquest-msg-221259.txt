Erm, go back and check _Shamanism_ by Eliade and I do believe that you'll find
that a shaman's role in their society is really to defend their people against
the depradations of the evil and/or merely obnoxious spirits that roam about
the lands.  As such, and really not answering the questions of "where did
we come from?" and "Where do we go when we die?" they really aren't priests of
a religion.  Unless of course one relaxes the definition of religion to
encompass them. :)
