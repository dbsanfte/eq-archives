Goodness, you describe yourself so well... That's exactly how I envision 
you.

Now, I see in other threads, you're actually attemting to make useful 
contributions to this group.  you know, things that actually have 
some relevance to EQ.  Good.  Why not do that instead of trying to 
act like Mr. Omnipotent who's out to re-make our lovely newsgroup in his 
own image?  Then you might not get so many _valid_ abuse complaints filed 
against you, and get your account TOSed every other day.  Wouldn't that be 
more fun?
