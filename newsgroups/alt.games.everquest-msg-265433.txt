Strange... I run mine at 1280x1024, shadows off, 32bit, sky on, textures 
high, all models, max clip plane, etc, and the pok is silky smooth 
unless I hit the main bank or some other large crowd of PCs, and my 
video card is not as new as yours.

I presume you've got the most recent drivers?

Hmmm... looking at the rest of your specks, we've got the same amount 
RAM, but I'm in a P4 2.8 800FSB, AGP8x...

I'm wondering, unlikely as it is, if AGP4x is causing problems with such 
a top end card... but I'd think that would affect your other titles too.

Whats your cpu usage like? Is it possible your video card isn't the 
choke point? Hmm... that theory jives with the 'no sadness as you bump 
up the resolution'... I suggest looking for non-video related 
bottlenecks, Other software running, driver issues, try disabling audio, 
listen for hard disk churn, spyware/adware/virii could do it too...

A lot of the above should be impacting in Doom3 etc though so I'm not 
sure, although EQ is really ram intensive even compared to those...
