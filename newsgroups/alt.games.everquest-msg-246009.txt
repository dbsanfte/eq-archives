Was this really necessary?
Faster hp regeneration would have been enough,but medding 
while bandaging up to 70%?
I find this excessively exaggerated.

My little baby level 16 enchanter,heavily twinked I admit,was already
soloing the mobs in Paladual  with very little downtime,levels 12 to
16 only took 3 1/2 hours.
This will *not* force me to group,the opposite is true,I can see him
now meleeing solo up to the mid fourties.
