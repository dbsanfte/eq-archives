Necro's can solo much better than any druid ever could... we get
better dots than druids, decent DD's (but we never use them when
kiting) and we get a snare that is also a dot.  Only thing bad about
our snare spell (darkness) is that it only lasts 2 minutes, so you
need to refresh it... but our dots are all done in about 2 minutes, so
only snare refresh is all that is usually needed.  We also get a
wonderful pet that loves to hug the mob's ass that we are kiting
(actually, reverse kiting).

The three things that make necro's god-like when kiting are:
We can fear kite... the mob is feared, it doesn't agro on anyone else.
We have a great pet that can outdamage any warrior in the game.
And we have mana regen spells.  This is what saves us the most time.
We cast a few dots, sit down, let pet work em over some... by the time
the mob is dead, you have lost 2 bubs of health, but are at full mana,
so you pull another mob instantly and make sure one of your dots is a
lifetap dot and you get all your health back, still have full mana at
end of fight, still have pet wacking away, and another mob dead for
even more exp... and on you go with the next.

Druids have to sit down after EVERY fight and med for long periods of
time.  Only way they can catch up with us some is to quad kite...
that's something necro's can't do all that well.  We can keep a few
mobs mezed or snared/feared while we work over one, and then be ready
for the next, but we can't take them all at once cause we dont really
have any good area spells.  But we can fight non-stop almost...
basically no downtime if you know what you are doing.
