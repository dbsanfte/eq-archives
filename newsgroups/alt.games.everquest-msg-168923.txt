Sure it is.  But I agree that anyone who kills the idol unslowed is at least in
the game to defeat AoW.

Once the MT's defensive disc drops, you have to be pretty much perfect to keep
him alive.  (We just did it, one MT for the AoW, but our guild is a bit farther
along, too.)  When we first started killing him, we would count on 3 main tanks.
The key IMO is to designate the second tank in advance and get the rotation
started on him before he gets aggro, letting some other melee guys dies.

Don't let the AoW pick the second/third MT.
