For this exact spell I can't be positive, but it sounds suspiciously
like something we ran into with some other "shared" spells.  There was
at least one case where there were *three* versions of the same frigging
spell for two classes.  Necros and Wizards share quite a few spells.
(Other classes have this adorable trait also.:-p)  On top of that, SK's
get some of them. However, since SK's don't get research, being hybrids,
they have to buy theirs at a vendor.

What you can apparently run into (or could at one point, anyway) was
three "flavors" of that same spell.

1. If a wizard researched it, it was wizard only.
2. If a necro researched it, then Necro or SK only.
3. If it was vendor purchased, any of the three.

This may be changed by now, though, so not positive. I agree with the
other poster that, if you plan to buy it in the bazaar, limit your
search by class to "wizard" and if you get one it should be usable for
you. Either way, be sure to right click on it first and see if it says
Wizard, or "Can Not Use" on it to make sure you have the right scroll.
