I'm just pointing out that while your familiar with the changes 
themselves, you really only have seen how they affected raiding guilds. 
(Positively of course, by reducing backflagging obstacles/tedium.)

Yes, but the 85/15 rule has smoothed out the issues getting people 
deeper in.

Not quite the same as having the flags though.

That's arguably the best argument in your favour. If it was *that* easy 
to get time flagged, given how long PoP and the 85/15 rule have been 
around why AREN'T there more open time raids. :)

We agree again. Its easier to get some, but apparently not to 
"progress", as we STILL don't have frequent open time raids that I'm 
aware of.

I'm saying that often when an Time+ player wants to get an alt pop 
flagged, his guild won't do it, but he usually can put together a group 
of guildies to be the core, host an open raid for the bulk, and often 
they 85/15 a bunch of that "bulk". The 85/15 wasn't intended for that.

And I beleive its detrimental to the guilds that are taking advantage of 
it. It gets players "ahead of themselves". They don't want to progress 
with their guild because they've leapfrogged a few raids ahead.

I'd have to agree with you that they aren't leapfrogging all the way to 
Time, but I think the disruption of having your guildmates constantly 
leapfrogging the lower tier flags undermines the guilds ability to move 
as a cohesive unit, and actually slows the guild down as a whole. 
Particularly as the players being leapfrogged aren't really learning the 
event, and tend to become dependant on the 'uber' cores that frequently 
run those raids. Ie... a couple experienced and geared Anguish players 
in key raid roles is quite different than pre-elementals in those roles. 

For a number of these raids, I'd give the open raids better odds of 
success than a young guild raid... simply because the open raids are 
often run be people who -know- them, and tanked by much better equipped 
players than a young guild can field. I beleive this is a destructive 
force to young guilds, as it rewards opportunistic individual 
advancement with random groups more than building a competent cohesive 
guild... at least in the short term. But if you destroy a guilds short 
term it won't have a long term.

Admittedly even without 85/15 players could still progress and leave 
their guilds behind by joining open raids they are flagged for, but the 
disruption is less, and the advantage is less. And even if it hasn't 
come to pass YET, their is the theoretical possibility they can leapfrog 
all the way to Time. The 85/15 encourages self-destructive play style.
