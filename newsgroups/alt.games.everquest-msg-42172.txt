It amazes me that people who obviously know absolutely nothing about a
subject, feel that they somehow must have something to say about it.  Rather
than wasting your time trolling newsgroups and inflicting those who read
them with your drivel, why not go onto the web and find out something about
the subject.  In the case of  bin Laden, he has been a presence on the web
for a long time and his policies and positions are widely available from
translated Arabic sources.  If you would take the time to read his work
along with some of the more standard commentaries on the Islamic world you
might eventually have something worth saying and listening to, or at least
be able to formulate a reasonable informed question.  Otherwise you are
simply ignorant and hardly worth the energy it takes to sustain the presence
of your opinion and drivel in this or any other news group.  What is needed
now is not this kind of nonsense but honest rational inquiry and debate, and
none of these are possible until people like you take the time to find out
what the hell you are trying to talk about.
