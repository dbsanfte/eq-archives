Methinks he suffers from the belief that being an uber guild player somehow
makes him a better player or more worthy. Since his gear is so much better
than the average player he must be better to deserve it right?

In truth raiding is mind numbingly boring a good deal of the time. However
it is worthwhile for the gear .

The sad part is the uber guild players single grouping in ldons that are
censored from your list because they are so incompetent. It happens ALOT .
Damn raiders cant do their jobs worth a damn.

p.s. oh and by the way im a long time raider in a raiding guild :p We are a
casual raiding guild though only raiding 4 nights a week. Still stuck on the
Rathe.
