Obviously, the loser proceeds to /tell the winner how much he sucks, and
that he is also gay, fat, a nerd and 13 years old (dunno what it is with
that particular age...). The winner will reply gloating about how the
loser is his "bitch". The loser will then either log, or come back to
their corpse and continually attack the winner, but not wearing any gear
and not expecting to win. The loser will do that repeatedly. The loser
may then proceed to log on an alt and continually pumice the mob in
question while the winner is fighting it. Winner will most likely
petition, but that will take several hours to get a reply, let alone any
help. All the while the shit talk will continue in /ooc while the winner
and loser are in the same zone.

Even many days afterwards, when said winner and loser are in the same
zone the winner will gloat about how he owned the loser, and the loser
will reply saying that he was lagging.

Hope this helps.
