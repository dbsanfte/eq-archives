	A 50 Druid with 200 WIS can med to full in just over 7 minutes with KEI.

	Experience grinding in general is only feasable on low blues.

	Not with a delay 40 bow and my haste (60% for archery, and I don't have a
clicky haste item yet).  Certainly not with my old Wind Saber....

|Oh, and firing

	If you need to root the mob, you're better off turning and running to open
some distance.

|You sound like you're so set in a

	And you sound like you're pulling all this out of your ass.

	A quadding Druid earns experience much, much faster than I can, Archery or
no.
