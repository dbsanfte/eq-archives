Was out with a druid guildie today, working my Bard through my first
'hell' level in OT.  We were doing our usual blend of combining his
druid stuff with my fear kiting techniques.

While doing this, I was beginning to wonder if my Denon's (AoE) with
horn wouldn't be more effective then my dual wielding.  So, we were
experimenting with that when I inadvertantly got an added tiger
wandering by.  The druid ROOTed them both.  It so happened that I
could stand between them, twist Chords of Dissonance and Denon's
Discord - while they couldn't reach me!  Talk about the easy to kill
things... druid only had to keep 'em rooted and drop what ever DoT's
he wanted to, I did the twist/swap instrument shuffle.

So basically, the technique is have someone Root one, stand just
outside its reach (this didn't work so well with those Sarnak Knights
and their pesky whips, incidentally) and just twist the damage songs
and bellow.

I'm sure we've not invented anything new, but am wondering what
exactly you call the technique.  Park kiting?  Root singing?  ;-)
It sure worked well!
