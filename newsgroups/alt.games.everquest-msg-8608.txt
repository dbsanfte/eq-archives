Does anyone know of a good server to play on - not the PvP servers, please.
I know it's not going to happen, but I'm looking for one where critters are
plentiful, money is relatively so as well, and the player-based economy
doesn't run as high as it does on some servers due to inflation. It's a lot
to ask for, but I figure, Hey, if I don't have high hopes, what will Fate
crash against the rocky bluff of Reality?
