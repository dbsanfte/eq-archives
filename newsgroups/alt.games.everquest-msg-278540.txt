All the information about xp, equipment, etc., is on the EQ servers.
After all, it wouldn't make sense to let you modify files on your own
computer and suddenly make your character be level 70 with lots of
new equipment!

HOWEVER, most of the information about your user interface is stored
on YOUR computer.  Things like hotkeys, option settings, and how you
have your windows arranged.  Those are in files in the EverQuest
folder with names like charactername_servername.ini, and
UI_charactername_servername.ini, and also eqclient.ini (which holds
settings that apply to all the characters).  So you might want to
save those files and copy them back once you've reinstalled.

If you've saved any screenshots, you might also want to salvage those.
They're in the screenshots folder inside the EverQuest folder.
