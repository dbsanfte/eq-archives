You too? Since rouges are very much the in-thing (right behind leezard
monks) these days, you'd have thought tanks would have a better idea as
to where to stand. A few less parries and ripostes simply is not worth
losing your Rogue's ability to backstab (or indeed double-backstab) for
hundreds of points of damage every few seconds.

And, schnook tanks, let me position myself opposite you. As long as you
all stand together, I can manoeuvre myself into position just fine. It's
part of my job.
