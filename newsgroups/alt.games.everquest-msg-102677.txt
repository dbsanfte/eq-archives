    Because the goal is to win, and the points are the same whether the pick is
young or old, healthy or sick.  Oh, don't get me wrong.  I would have loved to
put together a list that looked more like---

1 Martha Stewart
2 Rush Limbaugh
3 Rosie ODonnell
4 Adam Sandler
5 Howard Stern
6 Dennis Rodman
7 Monica Lewinski
8 Tonya Harding
9 Pat Robertson
10 Lester Maddox*

Fer instance, but if I had, how many hits would I have now?  Exactly none.  The
sad fact it, older people are much more likely to die in any particular year
than the younger ones, no matter how desperately we wish that the people on our
list would just shut up already and step into the fricking light.

*Is actually on her real list.  A former governor of Georgia, he made waves in
1964, the year of my birth, oddly enough, by driving black patrons from his
restaurant in defiance of federal law, then closed the place down rather then
desegregate.  God, I hope he's one of my hits this year.  

Annie <-- Has to go to work in 3 minutes, so didn't look up the correct spelling
of the names on her dream 
          list.  But you know what I mean.


-- 
Living in the universe known as Drinal
All who are old enough have the last name Benlen

Teashot -- Wood Elf Ranger, 28, Enemy of Rockhoppers.
Tealeef -- Barbarian Shaman, 25, terror of Marus Seru.
Teabomb -- Gnome Wizard, 21, nervous in Stonebrunt.
Teadead -- Human Necromancer, 20, aren't gargoyles supposed to have eyes?
Teaword -- Dark Elf Magician, 14, hurting island sisters.
Teafist -- Human Monk, 12, Dodging the AC in Sro.
Teacure -- High Elf Cleric, 9, queen of the commons.
