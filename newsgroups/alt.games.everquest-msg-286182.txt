Next day, I logged in and found some old friends still in the guild, who 
  decided to make me into a bit of a project.  Made me some magnetic 
gauntlets, handed over a couple other spare pieces of loot that were an 
upgrade, and then off we went to RCoD to hunt up a couple more, plus 
something one of them needed.  A couple hours later, lucky with the 
drops, I had my gear plus a lesser rune, good for one 67 spell.

That completed, we went off to Paw, where we hunted up a couple more 
pieces of gear, got a couple augments that can only be used with time+ 
gear (slot 8, you get from handing in four orbs that drop off the names 
who announce themselves when they spawn) but more to the point, spent so 
much time killing PH's and misc mobs in the way that the exp was just 
pouring in.

I burned my Lesson (vet reward), and then one after another drank all 
ten charges of a potion that gives similarly enhanced exp for a half 
hour per charge.  Net result, I went from one yellow bubble into 65, all 
the way thru 66 and one yellow into 67.

Next evening was a raid on Sol Ro tower, we got all but Jiva, who was 
already dead when we got there for some reason.  After that was over, an 
attempt was made at a Hedge run, which was disasterous.  First someone 
managed to get stuck on a rock, then they gated out and got lost trying 
to get back to PON, then when they tried to invis back to us, they 
caught aggro and had to gate again.  Finally they gave up and we decided 
to go in without them... and only one of the three groups could trigger 
the hedge.  We gated back out to reset, tried all over again, and this 
time we got a similar result, only it clearly told us that the maze was 
now full!

Saturday I helped some friends out with little projects, then MT'd a 
more successful hedge run.  Really felt back in the swing of things, 
getting a feel for grabbing and retaining aggro and so on.  We tried the 
charm SOW release trick to speed things up, but the pickup raid kept 
getting messed up and spread out, we eventually wiped the slate clean 
and just let him amble.

Today, did part of an LDoN but was too slow to finish before the raid 
started.  I was startled to discover that we were going to do the 
Emperor Ssraa... pretty much in my honor, it wasn't posted as planned. 
That was a fun fight, and I ended up getting the emperor's sword at the 
bargain price of 15 DKP; the other knights already had it or better, and 
the warrior who was bidding against me decided he only wanted it and I 
needed it.

Then the big time, Vex Thal.  On the one hand, it was the culmination of 
a couple months of work, and of my longing to join my guild in there 
during the 4 months I'd been away.  On the other hand, what a boring 
slogfest.  Mobs all more or less the same, feeling like I was working my 
way thru AR or something.  Nothing fancy, no variations to speak of, 
just the same mobs again and again, using numbers to make things 
challenging I guess.  We used COTH to shortcut in a couple places (not 
too many, because there are certain mobs which must be killed or things 
appparantly go badly at the end) and otherwise just slogged thru.  This 
reminded me a bit of Sleeper's Tomb; I was proud to be there, but if it 
wasn't for the honor of the thing, I'd sooner have been doing NToV. 
That said, on the gripping hand, there was some sweet loot that dropped, 
a couple of the pieces going for record high DKP amounts, no doubt we'll 
be doing this again.

About half my guildmates are still in there hanging out and making it a 
great place to be.  And about half the guild are new fish who don't know 
me from Adam... except that most of them fit in so well we were 
insulting each other like people who'd known each other since the server 
opened.  Good times.
