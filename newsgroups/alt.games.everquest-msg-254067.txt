>>>>Well, I think so, yeah. :D I've got a quest from my guildmaster telling 
me to collect some material to use with a mold of a helm he gave me. The 
only problem is I have absolutely no idea where to look for the stuff. 
He suggested Ro or the commonlands but >>I have yet to see a drop that is 
even remotely similar to what he said I needed. The only ingredient I 
remember at the moment is iron ore, which I know isn't a drop but I have 
no idea where or how to find that. So, basically, I think I have gotten 
the quest but I'm still trying to figure out how to figure out what to 
do with it.


Most of the Paladin armor quests from Freeport can be accomplished by hunting
creatures in the area outside West and East Freeport, East Commonlands and
Northern Ro ( the grassy areas). 
FOr example, in the East Commonlands Orc pawns drop Crude Iron Ore, shadow
wolves have the tibia and the various beetles and spiders drop the items. 
Also loot the orc picks as well for another quest. Some items can also be
bought.  

Combine the items (except the mold)  in the assembly kit and then into the
forge with the mold. Out comes the armor piece.
