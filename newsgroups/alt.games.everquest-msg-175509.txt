How far do you take this?  For example, what do you think of Project
Entropia, which is an MMORPG that will not charge a monthly fee nor charge
for the client, but allows you to buy in-game money for real life money, so
you can buy better in-game equipment (and you can sell in-game money for
real life money, too).

It seems to me that there are things that it is OK for MMORPG companies to
charge for, and things that it is bad for them to charge for.  SOE with PoP
and this new expansion has crossed the line from OK charges to bad charges,
in my opinion.  When I say OK and bad, I mean from the point of view of
whether or not they are good for the game, not good for the company.

OK things to charge for include new lands, and new races and classes if
those can only start in the new lands.

Bad things to charge for are changes to the game system (e.g., the
experience system, spell and combat mechanics, etc) and the user interface.

The later things are bad because they make it so people with different
expansions are not really playing the same game.  E.g., if someone with just
the basic game starts a new character in, say, Freeport, and plays just in
the original areas, and someone else, with all expansions, also starts in
Freeport, and also plays just in the original areas, that person with the
expansions will have a better game.  That just doesn't seem right to me.
