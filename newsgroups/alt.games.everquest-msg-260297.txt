 spell books, -- dumb idea
 night blindness, -- loved it
 real corpse recoveries -- loved it
 blinding rain, fog and snow -- loved it
 and wetting myself over how to spend my first ten gold -- loved it

 I remember only being able to buy one spell -- I loved having to choose 
my spells, agree it was stupid that you couldn't tell what they actually 
did.

I remember when people were completely naked except for one or two items 
they had looted and we were level ten -- Love that. I still play the 
first 20 levels like that except maybe for a weapon, if i'm feeling 
lazy. 

I remember being level 32 and having 24 days played, a Hybred experience 
penalty of 20% and...

32 out of a max of 50 in 24 days played (6 months real time? less?) in a 
game that was designed to take a year or so real time on average... you 
were doing just fine.

Sure. But that doesn't mean Vangaurd isn't going to have a significant 
audience. Lots of people liked most of the stuff you just whined about.
