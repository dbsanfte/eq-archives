That's brings up an issue that's annoyed me for nearly three years now.
Why is it that there are bazilions of mobs/camps that are great exp
and/or loot for solo or duo casters and death (or dogslow due to
recovery down-time) for melee dependant groups/soloers, and yet I
can't think of even one reverse case.  Not saying there aren't any,
but I cannot think of a single example.  The few places I can think
of that a solo hybrid or hybrid + pure-melee duo can do ok are far
easier for casters and thus usually camped by a_druid_7321098 or
a_necro_41182.  It's not like it'd be hard to set them up.  This is,
I think, the fundamental reason the game is so intensely caster-centric.
It's pretty sad when I think of all the melees I know who've set up
(or bought) a second account just so that they can make a druid
"servant" to allow them to have fun when a group is hard to come by.
