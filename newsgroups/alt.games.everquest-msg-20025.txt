*CHuckle* I present myself in a manner that won't get me flamed?
You're new here, aren't you?

By the way, there's this little key...two of them, in fact. On is
located right under your enter key, the other under your capslock. It
has "Shift" written on it. It's a very useful key. Next, there's one 2
over from that shift key under your enter key. It has a > over a
little dot. Another one that comes in handy quite often.

Or do you prefer looking like a sub-sentient neanderthal when you
post?
