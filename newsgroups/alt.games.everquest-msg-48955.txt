Took 3 tries, but yes, I did manage.

First time I had that experience was at level 6, blind as a bat, running
through BB (not sure how I made it all the way down the tunnel), fell into
the water, was being eaten by the fishies.  Again, took 3 tries but I did
get gate off then too.  Good thing too, because I didn't know how to swim
yet at that point either.
