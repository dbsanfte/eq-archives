If I am looking for a port, which is not all that common anyway, I tend to
try the bank (FV and Thurgadin are good) and Druid or Wizard portals.  I go
there first, then ask people who are nearby if I can get a port, and I
always offer to pay for the service.  More often than not, if I need a ride
in a hurry, it's a guild event of some type, and transportation is
available.  If I'm not in a major hurry, I use Nexus.
