This hammer you get by
a) being amiable to the Skeletal Foreman (single skeleton at the
boat construction site in the outpost)
b) getting a Jade from somewhere (at the time you are amiable
to the skelly, you can buy this one off tin merchant IV)
c) turning in the Jade to the skeletal foreman, voilï¿½:
Your Hammer of Overthere

Its a 2h blunt All/All Weapon, that PROCS Overthere Gate,
Infinite Charges and only procs when you are level 50plus,
it's also LORE NO DROP....
