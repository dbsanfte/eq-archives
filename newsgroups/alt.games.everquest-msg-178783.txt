We tried Ntov for the first time last weekend, after a couple of wipeouts we
came up with this. When you enter NTov immediately run right and enter the
door facing you, in there you'll find 5 or 6 hatchlings ally to CoV - that's
about it. We tried the run in singles, that way the Pats (who seem to have a
massive agro range) don't seem to agro as much (probably coincidence) if
you're one of the unlucky ones who gets mauled on the way just get your
Monk/SK/Rogue to drag you to the right room.
