Technically, you can get over 2000ac, but we're talking theoretical
here, will full Vuulak armour, CoV factioned ToV quests etc. Only the
select one or two will ever come close. 

I'm pretty fortunate with the equipment I have, but I already have
paladins in my guild with comparable/higher AC. The trouble with the
best armour there is, is that it's multi-class. Warriors tank because of
one thing: /disc defensive. 

Look at it another way.

If these top end items are already available, if you already have the
best there is, what will be the incentive to raid the new SoL ubers,
other than to say you have? AoW and Tunare are already too high risk for
their reward, despite dropping obscenely high ac gear and ft3 robes.
Epic armour certainly fits in the progressional theme of things. I doubt
anyone will bother getting another epic tier weapon after the last set
(weapons change too fast for the effort) and hard to obtain epic armour
will give a target for the high end guilds for a considerable amount of
time.

I'm sure if you check out Mort's inventory across servers, you'll find
half of ToV's loot in there already, and it's only going to get worse.
Vuulak has such a large loot table, you *will* get to the point where
you're junking too much to make the effort of clearing ToV worth it.
Same thing as happened with Trak and VS. Sure you still needed some of
his items, but the chances of getting stuff you didn't need (yay! 2 more
SK BPs!) made it not worth the time. We're relatively new to ToV (15 or
so Vuulaks) yet our next druid arms will probably rot. If they are
intending to keep the highest level of players interested, class
specific armour questing is the only way I can see to add new stuff
without further blurring the lines between warrior AC and other plate
classes.
