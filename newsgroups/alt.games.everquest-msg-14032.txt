How? By stealing credit cards? The downside of that little endeavor is people
tend to bring in law enforcement, which does care about such things. By robbing
phone cards? Once again, the boys in blue start to look for you.

Why do you insist on calling it "high-level"??? It is as high-level as he news
reader you are using.

>plays EQ.

Totally true--except you tend to fish in water, and the smart fisherperson uses
a net. You tell your sniffer to look at packets going to a specific address,
and record the header information. As data passes by you, it is auto recorded.
You come back in the morning and have a few accounts. Plus, all of the data is
snaking through like tiny creeks that merge into rivers that eventually flood
the Mississippi--the closer you are to the network site where the EQ server is,
the more "fish" you catch. If you are directly upstream from the EQ login
server, your sniffer gets to catch every last fish. That is correct, the main
server that EQ gets its feed from can detect all 350,000 passwords. 

Your numbers above are like saying there is no population problem because the
Earth has 162,777,600 square miles of surface area, and only 5,000,000,000
people, or an average of 30 people per square mile. Great in theory, just don't
be trying to rent a place in NYC.

We are not discussing high-level hackery. You think you are, but we know we are
not.

Huh? Dude, one login server.

The odds of a randomly picked hacker having access to this small. The number of
hackers who do have access to it is large. You remind me of Hitchhiker's Guide
To The Galaxy, which "proved" that the population of the Universe was zero.
After all, when you take into account all the room, and divide it by the
population, you get a number which, rounded off, equaled zero.

The odds that a person you select at random will rob a bank or store today is
pretty much zero. The number of banks and stores that will get robbed today
are, however, quite high.

Or be standing in a major portion of the data stream, which quite a few people
are doing. Remember, all of this data swims up the stream to major junction
points, where it keeps merging and merging as it heads for the EQ login server.
The odds of a bear catching a salmon is low, unless the bear is standing in the
river where the salmon are swimming upstream. At that point, the bears get
quite fat.
