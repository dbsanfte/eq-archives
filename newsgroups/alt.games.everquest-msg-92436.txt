Oiy, yeah. Worst for us is sports...when the national feeds have a
game blacked out and the local channel carrying it is having technical
problems at the source (ie: NOT OUR DAMN FAULT!). Even went as far as
to offer a guy credit for his local channel services, and his response
was "How is that going to make me whole again?". Any idea how hard it
was NOT to laugh at that guy until after he was off the line? ;-)

4 months? Gosh, we don't even give them that long. ;-p PPV is bad...
The remote-control PPV ordering is dependant on a phone line in the
receiver, because that's the only way to transmit the order history
from the receiver to their bill. If there's no communication, they
can't be charged for the PPV. Someone decides to disconnect that phone
line, and gets pissed when they can't order PPV anymore after they
miss callbacks for 2 months... (Nevermind that the service contract
says plainly they need that line, and the installer told them that...)
Of course, they insist they've been charged for the PPV for that time,
even though the billing ledger I'm looking at shows otherwise.

Remote control programming... Gotta hate that. "IT won't work my
volume anymore, it's broken! Whaddya mean I gotta program it, it still
changes channels!" They don't understand that channel changing is a
function of the receiver and volume is a function of the TV.

Had one guy, bought a brand new model RCA... "17th off the assembly
line!". Paid close to $1000 for it (HDTV UltimateTV system, I think...
TiVo and all that fun stuff). Around $15k for his whole entertainment
system. Was having problems getting it set up, and had to spend his
weekend off on the phone with DTV and RCA both getting step-by-step
help. Guy actually went off about how he makes "$500 an hour" and he
was gonna bill DTV for his time. Yeah, sir, go ahead and send the
bill. Just don't expect to collect... Guy makes more in 3 hours than I
make in a month and wants me to feel sorry for him. As if.
