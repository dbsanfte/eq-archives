Hi,
I have had exactly the same problems since last Tuesday - Playing last
Monday was fine, then after the last patch / the WTC disaster it all went
downhill.

On Tuesday / Wednesday nite there were a lot of people in chat saying the
same thing.

I basically cannot play eq anymore.  If I can get into the game the lag is
sooo bad (95%ish) and I get disconnected after about 30 seconds.

Hellllppppp :(
