Just what we need, more druid whining Ala the grove - 

1 - druids can solo for decent XP in PoP zones where most classes can't
2 - druids can be main healer for any xp group short of elementals.
3 - druids make a fine DPS class
4 - druids bring serious utility

Perspective based on having grouped with the same druid for the last 
2 years since she was in her 40's.
