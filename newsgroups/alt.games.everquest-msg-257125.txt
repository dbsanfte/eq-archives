Hi all,

	Yes, but the files I copied were already patched.  I don't
require any patches on my desktop, only on the laptop once I've copied
them over.  The copy I made on the laptop is a completely patched
version.  For some reason the patcher wants to download them all again
and that's what I can't work out.

Regards,

Wayne...
