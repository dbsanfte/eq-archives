I periodically take 5 or 10 minutes and just cruise thru the key
assignments to see what's available.  Not only does it change from
time to time, but you may find something that seemed useless in the
past, but that you can now take full advantage of.

In addition to finding some features that you want to assign keys to,
you may want to *remove* some key assignments.  I've done that for
keys that I know I will never use, either to free up those keys for
other uses, or because I'm afraid that pressing a particular key will
get me into a state that I'm going to have trouble recovering from.
For example, some keys toggle visibility of UI elements that I know I
always want to see... no point in having the key and maybe pressing it
by accident in the heat of battle.
