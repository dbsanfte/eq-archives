No, I distinctly recall the devs outright denying that there was
anything wrong with alchemy.

I also remember how, while Brad and crew were in charge, people
absolutely despised them. Suddenly, everyone's singing praises to
them...

There are a lot of things that have changed about EQ since they left
that are bad, yes. But there are a lot more things that have improved.
UI changes, no more book-in-face for medding, hybrid penalties
"patched over" into non-issues, hell levels gone, no more sitting on
my ass for up to an hour to get from one continent to another (waiting
for the boat to show up at the dock, then another 30+ minutes riding
it unable to even freaking fish while I watched the scenery pass),
tradeskill UI changes, so on.

Some of the bad changes: PoK (The Nexus and spire ports were fine. PoK
was overkill on trivializing travel), too much high end gear filtering
down into the lower level game (I MISS seeing people actually using
bronze/banded/fine plate armor, velium weapons, so forth. I actually
think the Bazaar is to blame there), oversaturation of the economy,
too much catering to the endgame, so on.

( On night blindness: It was too severe before, it's been way
over-fixed now.... *sigh* )

Someone posted a scale of 1-10, 1 being Brad's days, 10 being now. Me,
I'd want a 5.

My point is, Brad's days weren't great. They weren't really any better
than things are now. We have problems now, but they're a tradeoff for
problems that left with Brad and crew.
