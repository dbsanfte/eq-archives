That's how it works for rogues, but the point being made was that
for NON-rogues, even if they have both skills, they can't move
while hidden.  I just verified it with my halfling druid: I can
sneak (confirm it works by checking that an apprehensive NPC is
indifferent when I get behind him), move in front where he can
see me, hide, verify he's indifferent so the hide worked, then
move while still sneaking -- and I'm no longer hidden.

The ability to move while hidden really is unique to the rogue,
so far as I know.
