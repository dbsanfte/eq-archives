Including tolerance -for- religion.

Perhaps you don't understand just what our faith means to alot of us.  I
would no more insult someone's religion, than I would insult their wife or
children.  Something that holds such a high place in a person's life is
off-limits, as far as I'm concerned.  For you to decide for someone else
that they take their relgion too seriously is extremely arrogant.
