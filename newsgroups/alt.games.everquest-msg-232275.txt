Hehe.  To this day people ask why I don't put clothes on my level 45 wood elf
druid.  She is fully dressed, thank-you, with some very NICE gear IMO.  I do
get some great donations when offering ports tho :)))))
And the Tunarean Scout Leggings my 57 ranger wears still looks like a thong on
her.  If you see it on the link it looks like pants.  Yuck.  I finally dyed my
entire bottom half black so I don't look like some kind of freak.
(Furthermore Alakhazam doesn't even list them as usable by me so I can't finish
my character sheet...)
