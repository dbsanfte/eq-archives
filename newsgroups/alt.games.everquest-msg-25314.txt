Sounds like your tank was a little focused.  you can always
say in group speak help get it off me, to make sure they
realize your getting beat down.  Not sure why the tank
didn't switch/start on the Lego anyways.  I know most groups
I have been in, unless there is a reason (such as a mob has
been DoT'ed, so can't be mezzed), it's been standard
operating procedure to take out the toughest mob first,
unless there is a healer mob present in which case, take out
the healer first.  It happens, not every group is good, not
every group is bad.  Unless you play together regularly, I
would say most groups tend to be mediocre at best.  I have
been in some groups where we are a fine oiled machine, and
others where we can't seem to get anything accomplished. 
Often times within the same group, with just one member
changing.  Don't let one bad experience turn you off from
grouping.  I for one like to see necro's in groups, it
doesn't happen often but when a necro knows what they are
doing they are so versatile, that they are a huge asset to a
group.
