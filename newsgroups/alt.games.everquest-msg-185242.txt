My highest is lvl 35, but I've got a Cleric who just rounded 10, a
froggy-wiz who's at 5/6 and a 1/2 elf bard I just started last night who's
now 5.  (non of those guys were tweaked by my higher levels... everything
they have they *earned* heh heh)

I keep all of my player slots filled on the Rathe Server and currently play
6 of them...  (two, the dwrf paladin and the Ogre Warrior haven't been out
of the shoot yet... heh)

I like to play differently, depending on my mood, and I get bored playing my
main for days on end... (the mindless goal of leveling...)  having the
others make the game much more exciting!  Get mad a cleric for screwing the
healing on my tank/warrior?  Go play my cleric and show "them" how to do it
right!!
