AGI for an enchanter is pointless.  Do not spend your ability points on AGI.

However, AGI for melee characters, especialy monks, does make an impact.
AGI will directly affect the AC, and that's important.

I've had a lot of characters I played to the 20th level or so point.  And
the one thing I dicovered is having an agility over 100 will ensure your
DEFENSE skill climbs quickly.  The Defense skill directly translates into
AC.  So it's nice to have your AC capped within 10 battles of dinging to a
new level.  But this is only relevent to those classes which care about AC.
The enchanter class is not concerned with AC.

Enchanters care about INT first, then CHA.

Although, I keep hearing people say that a high DEX will improve your
skill-ups with Jewlery crafting.  Not sure if this is true.
