Fu took a lot of losses recently with people just getting bored and
quitting, including some people I know that have been in the guild for
over 3 years. They're rebuilding atm.

ToT (Test of Time) is also rebuilding. I've got two close friends in 
the guild and the others I've met seem like a good bunch of people. 

Not sure about RoV, haven't really seen them around much but judging
from my last few encounters with them, Bristlebane's newest dood guild
seems to be Veeshan's Fury.
