Apparantly they figured out it wasn't working, and decided
to fix it in todays patch.  Then they did something awful
(I didn't really follow what) that necessitated an instant
patch to fix it.  I hadn't gotten around to testing it after
the initial patch... but testing after emergency patch showed
the same results as before today.

Namely, the spell does -nothing- other than put eat mana
and put up a buff.

I dueled another cleric, got us both down a coupe hundred
hp, then slapped MOR on her.  Watching carefully, one
swing at a time, I definately did -not- get HP back when
hitting her.  Further she was looking at her HP and reported
the same damage that I saw.

Only possibility, damage wise, is that I might have been
doing marginally more damage to her with each blow... but
if so there was no seperate "non melee damage" message as
you would expect.  When I hit her for 20, she took 20, no
more and no seperate message.

My guess is that rather than actually fix the spell, they
simply restored it to its older broken state.
