Except that no one goes there anymore.  In fact it's kind of sad to see the
Freeport Market completely empty.  Kinda reminds me of an old west ghost
town.

GFay just has newbies in it now.  Used to be some higher level players would
hang in GFay at the spires from time to time, but not anymore.

Same with EC.

So when it come to buying/selling players are pretty handicapped without
Luclin these days.

But, my guess is they'll survive :)
