I know, but I knew it couldn't be that.

I mean, I never touch IE, how could a setting change?  Nah, had to be 
the Verizon hookup.

I should say I "knew" it couldn't be that.

When I got back here and couldn't connect with my usual, well then I was 
forced to confront something I should have known all along... that not 
only is the universe is stranger than we imagine, but stranger than we 
can imagine... and Windowz doubly so.

Coulda been online all along, maybe... tomorrow I'll hook up the cell 
phone and see.
