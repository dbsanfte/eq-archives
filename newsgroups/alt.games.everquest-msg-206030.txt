In my opinion, yes. I've played the game since beta,and quit two years
ago. Came back to only find it is a completely new game (in some
sense). If you want legit low-level players who you can group with
(and not the twinks of D00dz), then try to the new Stromm server, or
play on Firiona Vie. BUT, since you're from the UK, you may want to go
to the European servers.

The more flexible a character class is, the better the class can solo.
Druids and Necros are 2 very good solo classes. Other classes are good
soloing because they are multi-faceted. Example, Beastlords make good
solo class because a) strong pet, and b) very good list of spells.
One-dimensional classes like Warriors and Clerics are going to have a
harder time soloing.

I personally am not even going to bother with EQ2. :)

EQ is easy. Just need patience, and a load of common sense. Quading =
being able to kite multiple mobs for experience (Bards good at this).
Kiting = outrunning a mob while landing DoT (poison-like spells), or
other damage-inducing spells. Twinking = Bane of EQ.


> 5) Is the server list I see (EQ Gold, UK) only populated with Europeans, or
> are the servers world-wide?


I think servers are world-wide, but there are dedicated servers for
Europeans.


> 6) I have all the expansion packs, but no idea how to use them?


Install all the software (Original, Expansions, etc). Then load EQ.
Set up your billing information. Login, then hit the Register
Expansion (if I rememebr correctly) button. Then type in the CD key
for EACH expansion. You'll have to do this several times for all
expansions.

But, I think if you've purchased the EQ Gold edition, it all comes in
with one-key?

Depends on HOW you like to play. From there, dig for info. Plenty of
sites out there that offer details of which class is better suited to
what role.

No way to answer this question. If you die 3 feet from where you were
bound, then it is easy. But, if your group was situated in the middle
of nowhere and you die, then it becomes a little bit difficult. There
is ALWAYS a way however.

They're there. You're just not looking hard enough. :)

Refer to question #1.

No.



> 12) Are there any UK guilds / groups worth joining as a casual.


Probably.
