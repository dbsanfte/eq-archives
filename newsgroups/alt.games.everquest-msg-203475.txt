You didn't even address my point that in order to play solo past the low mid
levels, you MUST play a caster of some sort. I'd much rather play my
Barbarian Warrior, but the makeup uf the game makes soloing him impossible.

Yes, all your examples refer to group play. It has nothing to do with
playing an exclusively solo Druid. Until you have played a Druid who never
groups, you can't really comment on my experience, can you?
