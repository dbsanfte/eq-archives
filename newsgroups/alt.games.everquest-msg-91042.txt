I have a 19th Beastlord and here is what I have learned:
We are weak in melee.
We are weak in healing ourselves and other players, this includes buffs.
We have these wonderful pets!
A fellow Beastlord said to me"but without our pets we are weak" My reply?
"With out their spells a caster is weak. " She had never thought about it
that way.  A beastlord's warder springs from their magic and is apart of
them, just like a druids casting and a warriors mighty sword arm. I have
been able to solo yellows and even reds since getting my puppy at 9th level.
Usually by sitting back, medding and monitoring his health and healing him
when he needs it. On many reds I will join in when the mob is down to 50%.
In groups I do about the same thing if there is no warrior, if there is a
good warrior with decent taunt then I will join in on the melee. Every class
is what you make of it, I tried a druid....and was shitty at it, just not
me. I love rangers but am now very much hooked on my Beasty. Don't know if
this answered you, but hope it shed some light.
