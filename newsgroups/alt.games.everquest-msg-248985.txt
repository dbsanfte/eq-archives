Halliburton runs a 6% of gross revenue as profit to shareholders. Some
insurance companies hit 50%. ALL porn companies hit at least 50%. Incidently
its always good news for dunkin doughnut owners as well.

While I am not at all happy with bush policies, he is so much better than
gore would have been it is not even funny. Democrats seem to have no working
knowledge of economics or any of the hard sciences. It is comical watching
the antics of the enviromentalists in that party. It is just sad watching
the socialists hell bent on destroying the lifestyle of average americans
through blatant economics stupidity. The least they could do is try to get
some historical perspective, its not like socialism has not been tried so
many times before in so many diffrent countries.

I fully supported the removal of sadam husein. Not because I thought he was
particularly guilty of being a threat, not because he was a malicious
bastard terrorizing his people (goverments have always been the primary
abusers and source of ongoing atrocities). I supported his removal just to
make a nice obvious example for all the other petty dictators. Dont fuck
with us because if your high enough on the shit list you may just have your
life ended painfully.

I really wish bush would let his generals do there damn job and quit trying
to be politically correct about war though. The job of a military is to kill
people and break things. Our military is particularly good at it with
minimal collateral dammage. Yet we have a big hullabaloo over guards in a
prison for known terrorists abusing them. I really detest the treatment our
guards are getting. They are guarding terrorists not a conqured military.
The men they where guarding did not fight under a flag openly , they stalked
hiding among women and children and targetted women and children. That they
where not sumarily executed is a testament to how much restraint we show as
americans, that they where not tortured for real with the nice hot pokers
will undoubtedly cost us many of our fellow american soldiers.
