Well let's see.  I'm a primary soloer for about a year and a half now.  
Real-life imposes 30 minute to 3 hour constraints (average about 1 hour) on 
my playtime, thus grouping, while possible in the longer playtimes, is not 
a real choice as it takes time to find a group.  Thus my expectations about 
leveling quickly are set appropriately.  I find that the game, particularly 
below 30, allows for extensive personal interaction without grouping 
provided you want to interact and play well with others (for example, I 
tend to give SOW and Breeze out for free, accepting donations when offered 
but expecting none and I always respond to /yell).  For even more 
interaction opportunites, there are guilds.  A dedicated grouper, with an 
eye out for good groups, needs a guild or a tight-knit circle of friends 
that plays at the same time.  There are just too many bad groups out there 
(or at least, people with no idea how classes play together and do NOT want 
to learn).
