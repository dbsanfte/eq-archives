You totally missed my point, that's exactly why batwings are
available, there are IMHO more mobs that drop bone chips
than bats that drop wings, since more classes use wings,
than do bone chips, it makes more sense to have wings
available for sale.  Wings are also used in Trade skills,
bone chips are not.
