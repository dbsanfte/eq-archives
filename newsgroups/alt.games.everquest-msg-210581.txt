The effect, besides being a 796 point rune, also adds 3 mana per tick.  Like
the poster above you said, not essential...but damned nice.  I'd sure like
one, but there's little chance of getting it.

None of the fights for it are beyond my guild, but it's very unlikely that I
could get enough of them together to do things like kill Phinny over and
over and over and over, hoping for the staff, or raid Fear over and over and
over, trying to catch the broken Golem up.

The Wizard epic is very annoying in that while none of it is hard, all the
parts that you need help for will tend to waste a lot of time of the people
who help you.
