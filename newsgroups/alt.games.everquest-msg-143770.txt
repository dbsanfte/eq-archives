 The problem with Dain is that he banishes people to the bottom of the
well. So if you fought him in the throne room, you'd eventually run out
of melee to kill him. So the standard practice is to fight Dain down
below so that when melee get banished, they can run back and join the
fight. 

 How Dain is normally pulled (in simplified form) is to have a Monk
aggro him and then jump down the well. Dain freaks out and makes it out
to the front. Monk is under the ice and Dain warps down through the ice
onto Monk, Monk runs Dain to Raid. 

 As I said in a previous post, I have not been in the VT encounter so I
have no idea how the two relate.
