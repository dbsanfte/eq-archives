Someone in PoK turned my Halfling Druid into a Froglok a couple of weeks
ago.  Kinda weird... I was just running around and the next thing I knew I
was gated a little bit and standing in front of a female Mage (I think).
She said hello, gave me some fireworks and other neato stuff, and then
turned me into a frog.

I didn't know other players could do that.  Still, it was kinda fun hopping
around PoK for the rest of my time there. )
