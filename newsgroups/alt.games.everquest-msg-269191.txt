Are you arguing that because it didn't happen enough to you, it's not
worth the effort to design around? That sounds rather like arguing that
since you haven't been robbed (or murdered), that the effort to catch
the thieves isn't worth the expense of the police. Yes, it's just a
game, not real life, which is why the job is done by programmers and
designers and rarely guides and GMs, not cops. Nor can you dismiss all
grief as a he-said, she-said nobody's right issue.

I have seen abuse or grief situations proportionally few times over the
years, but certainly much more than a handful. Many times I moved on,
some times I made peace, other times it was a misunderstanding, a few
times it turned into a positive experience. Very rarely did I petition.
None of these experiences means that the game shouldn't be designed to
minimize or eliminate abuse. Certainly it doesn't mean we should just
ignore deliberate griefers.

Whether there's a way to keep the feel of multiplayer and eliminate the
grief situations without making the game boring and sterile is another
matter altogether.
