I guess they aren't getting enough money from us with the previous 6
expansions plus the $13 monthly fee.   

I bought Evolution last month after being away from eq for almost 3 years.
 I was excited because I thought it'd be a chance to be 'caught up' with
 expansions and not missing anything.  Now I'm already 2 expansions
 behind.  Actually not too big a deal, I spose, because I'm not really
 tempted to buy these last two, and my highest character is only up to 14.
 But still, it seems pretty obvious they see their customers as cash
cows more than anything else.
