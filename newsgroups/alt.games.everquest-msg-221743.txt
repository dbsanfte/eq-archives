Ah... I misunderstood. I thought you took a fairly RAM heavy machine, 
and added yet another GB too it... not brought your machine up to a GB.

Definately going from 512MB to 1GB is worth it. (Although you'll get 
most of your punch just getting from 512 to 768MB) But from 1GB to 2GB 
there isn't much point, at least not for EQ.

Summer 2005? **Surely** you don't plan PC hardware purchases more than a 
few months in advance...!!! :)

IDE striping really probably isn't worth the cost, particularly for an 
EQ application. With a 2400XP your CPU is very solid, but is well off 
cutting edge now...you'd probably get more bang for your buck here... or 
with a video upgrade... depending on what you have.

The SATA drives are nice more for cabling then performance at this stage 
in their evolution. Performance is on par with IDE, but not appreciably 
better, and sometimes even slightly worse.
