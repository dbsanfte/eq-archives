The problem is that quite a few maps are unreadable against the
standard background colour.  Pale grey lines, white text - all too
faint for my poor eyes to discern.  In the last week or two I
discovered a program called "Mappie", which lets you change colours in
maps, and now I'm a happy chappy  :)

As someone mentioned, it shouldn't take a 3rd party to make a
work-around for something like this.
