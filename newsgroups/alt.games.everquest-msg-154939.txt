Kodiac's Endless Intellect -  (Also referred to as Clarity 3.)

Increase intelligence, increase wisdom, increase max mana supply, increase
mana regeneration by 15 per tick.  Lasts for 2 and a half hours.

The spell itself requires a level 60 enchanter to cast it, 900 mana,  and is
a rare drop from raid level Luclin encounters.  (Meaning the things that
drop the spell take 12 - 50 people, depending on how well equipped the
people are and which "boss".)
