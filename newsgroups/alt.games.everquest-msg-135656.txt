But none of that has anything to do with mana regen via KEI/POTC/five
bards singing manasong... cause not any of that is going to compete
with the massive mana flow of Mod2 plus cleric.  While the rest of the
raid is struggling along on this sort of slow (heh, if you can call
that slow) regen, the cleric and mage are printing up mana like they
had plates of $100 bills.

The mage needs enough mana to pump one rod out.  One.  Once the
mage plus cleric duo have one rod between them, they instantly become
the fastest mana regen in the game, assuming they are a well oiled
machine (HP to max, and never ever kill yourself with a rod, thats
bad form it slows things down!)

In which case, mana regen (for the cleric and mage, that is) should really
no longer be an issue... so perhaps neither should get the FT3 item.  Thing
is, mages can do their Mod2/get heal trick with shaman and druid as
well, while clerics are wholly dependant on a mage for this sort of astounding
mana flow.  Once again, I propose that a cleric is more likely to group or
raid with no Mod2 source dedicated to him, than a Mod2 mage is likely
to do anything but perhaps solo with no healer class in his group.

Well I imagine this does happen.. but thus far I've never heard a raid
leader sing out "mages mana?"  Mana check generally seems to be
"clerics mana?" as a rule... Perhaps the bottleneck moves to mages
at the next level of raiding, the guild I'm in is just at the HOT/poking our
heads in to NTOV nameds level now.  But I can't see how FT is going
to help mages in that bottleneck much, Mod2/Cheal is so massively
fast that I've been known to neglect to bother getting KEI back if it
gets dispelled...90% of my mana is coming from Mod2 anyway.

Yes, solo a mage surely qualifies for all the FT he can gather.  Of course
a solo mage also spends a lot less mana per kill than a solo cleric..   Up to
58, a cleric and mage are on the same footing, but once the cleric gets
BAoR its another ballgame.

Well thats good to hear, last I grouped heavily with a wizard was well before
familiars were introduced, and she didn't have her epic yet (got it about
a week after we stopped partnering) so I had no idea that was part
of the deal.
