Oh yes, I also wanted to point out that there are no on-line RPGs in the 
foreseeable future that are going to knock EQ off its throne.  Nothing.  
Even "Horizons" may never even be released.  Five years from now it 
could very well be king of the hill.  Even ten years.  It is insane to 
say, but the possibility is still there.  Also DAOCs main strongpoint is 
its zoneless and also how its user interface improvements.  In terms of 
content it is woefully lacking.

One good thing about DAOC is that it is very much in a growth stage.  It 
could very well be that within a few months they flesh out the world 
with more quests, my beloved fish, and even flying creatures.  But for 
now it very much lacks.
