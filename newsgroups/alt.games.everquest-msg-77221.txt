Well, unfortunately, I don't have a friend who plays EQ, unless you count my
ex who works for Microsoft in Seattle, and he pretty much only plays DAoC
now. I live in the wild woods and am lucky to have a decent connection, much
less friends who even know what EQ is! I don't mind -buying- the cd (though
of course, it would be better if someone *gave* it to me ;) ), I was mostly
wondering if it would be worth my while, considering the age of my
characters, in terms of new hunting grounds.

thanks!
