And now you're talking about respect. You are only capable 
of compassion towards those you respect ? Weird.

You should be proud. A real paragon of compassion and a 
role model for all.

" Hate the sin and not the sinner is a precept which though 
  easy enough to understand is rarely practiced, and that is 
  why the poison of hatred spreads in the world."......Ghandi

I feel sorry for you who thinks a silly little online game, which will
go out with a whimper not a bang, even appears on the scale of 
what is important in life. Out of curiosity, when did you get elected 
to express outrage on behalf of the everquest community ?  I play,
you don't represent my feelings, and dare I say you don't even come 
close to representing 1/10th of 1% of the player base.

I choose to save my concern and get offended by the 12 year old 
girl with a needle in her arm being sold on the street, or the events 
happening in Burma.

You get bent out of shape because of some perceived misconception 
of the EQ gaming community.

Time for a priority check I think.
