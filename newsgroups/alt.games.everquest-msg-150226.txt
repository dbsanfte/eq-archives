Here's the difference, if you disagree with Conservatives you are, by
definition, a liberal.  That's the way it works.  You are not necessarily,
however, a communist.

Disagree with a Liberal, you are a conservative, if you go to the exteme you
are an anarchist.  Fascism never quite falls in there.  Hmm, which side can
be said to be lying?

> Helping people is liberal.  Helping business is fascist.

/em sigh.  Do you really believe that?

Gore's grades in college were similar to Dubya's.  Of course, Dubya went on
to get an MBA from Harvard, Gore went on to fail out of Divinity School.
Which one was stupid?  I think Dubya has done a great job of clearing his
name, but there are those who will never accept it.
