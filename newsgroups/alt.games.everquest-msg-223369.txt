My minor beef with rescues is that short of slaughter, they seem to have the
hardest mobs.  The few that I've succeeded have all been close to the wire
due to med breaks, plentiful mobs, and player deaths.  But still, I'll give
them a go if it's just that, it's a challenge.

My *major* beef with rescue (and to a lesser extent, assassination) is that
when they start to shout/make a commotion, it does NOT take the Z-axis into
effect (nor does tracking of course).  I liked rescues until we fought
through a surprisingly tough dungeon to get to our guy--only to have him
*not be there.*  He was below us, which meant we had about 10-15 minutes to
fight through another 20% of the zone in hopes of finding him.

We failed without ever catching sight of him.

Because of that Z-axis thing, I haven't done a rescue since.  They're
supposed to be addressing this "semi-bug," though I don't know when or how.
