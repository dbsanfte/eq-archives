OK, by solo I mean do the whole 1 - 60 on your own.
right, can you get this BP solo?
No, then you can't use it as you'll never get it.
Best BP I can find that is droppable is a Cobalt.

Legs he can have, Tunic also and sceptre too but forget the primal velium
weapon, it's no drop.

Ok, maybe I am mistaken (not considering the level of twinking you may have
been going to)and you could still solo past mid 50's
(Without the no drop items could you take the the King spawn?)
By solo to 60 I don't mean, solo a mob or 5 every once in a while.
I stand by my other statement, without twinking you won't get passed 48 and
even with twinking I'd be surprised if it was possible, of course I've never
wielded a  12/18 weapon before so I can't imagine the damage output that can
be done by one.
