Please, Bizbee, continue being Bizbee.

As far as I give a shit, Bizbee is a poster that I respect for having a 
sharp mind, sharp wit, and good experience in the game. Apparently one of 
these things has offended your precious sensibilities, which has caused you 
to go on some silly stalker crusade. My advice to you is to grow some 
fucking skin, learn to get over it, and get a newsreader with a killfile.

And by the way, posting such things from your actual IP is a hellishly bad 
idea. I mean, *I* am not an evil hacker bastard(I hack for the Light Side 
of the Force, thank you very much), but I bet a couple lurk and would be 
interested in knowing that your roadrunner IP is 65.26.13.95 .
