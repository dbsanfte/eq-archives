    Congratulations, and if you read all of my post before trying to respond
to it, you would notice that I addressed that... oh, wait, below, you
noticed my response, and demonstrated that you didn't understand it.
    The reason people are talking to you about this (myself included) has
nothing to do with you pestering or not pestering him.  It has everything to
do with you complaining to us.
    The 'porter has the right to set the price and terms of the port.  You
have the right to not go with him.  You do not have the right to then
complain about him, and expect that everyone will agree with you because you
claim to be a nice person. (Well, you have the right, but reality won't bear
out the desired result).

> If they are
> busy camping something I just ask someone else. Do you understand that?
Also
> he said he woul leave his own camp fo 50 plat.

    "Do [I] understand that?"  Are you insane? (No, these questions have
nothing to do with each other, save that they are equally rhetorical, and
probably have dissimilar answers).
    The problem here isn't that you stopped bothering him, and that you
elected not to pay 70 plat (now 50 plat?) for a port.  It's that you then
logged on to the newsgroup, and whined about it.

    And then you log onto a newsgroup and complain about his pricing.
    Two quick stories, hanging out in NFP:
Lowbie_00: /tell me "can you port me to BB?"
Me: "No, GFay is as close as I can get you."
Lowbie_00: "That'll do, where are you?"
Lowbie_00 shows up, so i invite into group to port.
Me (since I was feeling generous and my something better wasn't too much
better): "That'll be 20 plat."
Lowbie_00: declines group, "No, I'd pay if you were fighting, but not just
sitting around Full of mana."
Me (wonders how a person can see my mana level, since I seem to be able to
others' ). [oh, and the utility is probably bugged, since I was anything but
FOM] thinking, "So I should port you for free, because I happen to be in a
city?"
(BTW Three hours later, Lowbie_00 was still in NFP, and presumably still
looking for a port)

Lowbie_01: /tell "Can I trouble you for a port to Nek?"
Me: in the midst of a very dangerous expiriment, but thinking I should be
logging instead of teetering on getting killed, "I'm not really in a
position to help you right now... but I suppose I could extract myself for
50 plat." (and immediately said to myself, "D'oh, I meant to type 100, oh
well").
Lowbie_01: "okay!  I'm at the Jade."
Me: "Be a minute."
/em takes some damage, and blows some mana to get there.
Lowbie_01 pays me, and I Translocate him to Nek.
What happened, I'm not exactly sure.  He claims that he never saw the
confirmation box, because he had his inventory up.  But I have never heard
of this bug.  The result was the same as if he'd hit "no."
Lowbie_01: "Oh, you're translocating me?"
Me: "yes, and you hit no, thus costing me the reagent."
Lowbie_01: [while I'm waiting for the spell to pop and mana to come back so
I can cast it again, BTW if you EVER hit no on a TL to where you asked, I
WILL charge you the full rate AGAIN] "Look I paid you 50, the reagent costs
1 plat, if you want to give me my 49 back, we'll call it off."
    I sent him anyway (truthfully half because I value the verbal contract,
and half to be rid of him).  The point is, you're not just paying for my
mana and reagents, you are paying for the time I have to take away from
whatever I am doing to deal with you.  The value of that time and
aggrivation is set by me.  I do several ports per long session with no
hassles.  In fact the most hassle free of my ports have been record setters
for price (well THE record was a major hassle, but that's besides the
point).  The hassles all come from the "customer," and usually revolve
around them thinking that they know something about me, or having some
preconceived notion about what I "should" be doing.

    You're right.  You're really an evil git for not spaming the zone.  You
should harrass people constantly, and complain in game to everyone you see
about every injustice you perceive. </sarcasm>

    You seem to have a reason for not spamming people in game, maybe you
should already have your own opinion about why it is good.

    So, do you often have nothing better to do than help out random people
who ask for it?
    Well, that's one way to play the game.  It's not the way I play.  If I
truely have nothing better to do, then I do one of two things:
    1) Stand around, waiting for random tells, and help out everyone I can.
or, more often:
    2) Log out, and go do something else. <gasp>

    Oh, and you make a false presumtion in your assertion that my "something
better" is not condusive to community.  My "something better" is often
helping a specific other person, or guild, or even just chatting with
friends.  Something better to do means something better than teleporting
some random person about.  What my price is for helping a random /tell is
always twice what it would be for me contacting the person who /ooc, /shout,
or /auctioned, which is based on what that "something better" is at that
moment.

    That's sweet.  And irrelevant.  Yes, it's annoying when you can't bind
yourself.  It's also annoying not to be able to gate.  It's also annoying
when people who you've just saved from an annoying time, can't be bothered
to say "thank you."

    Sorry, if you think it will generate more spam, but you seem to think
that Wizards are able to do something when they don't have mana.
    Please, for my own edification, what is it that Wizards can do without
mana?  I'd be really interested in how it is you think that I can avoid
about a quarter of the corpse runs I've been on.

> >     Want cheap ports everywhere?
> Thats the thing you dont get from my posts, I am nice to other people,

    You're right.  I don't get that from your posts, because you have stated
that you do the one thing that immediately sets off my irritant alaram
(direct /tell without advertising, if you think there are few enough
teleporters in the zone), and you came to a newsgroup to complain about a
price that you didn't like.  All the while saying you don't bother people
after they've either told you "no," or asked a price that was too high for
your tastes.
    This is duplicitous at best, and hypocrytical at worst.
