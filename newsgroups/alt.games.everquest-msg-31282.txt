On Fennin Ro right now there is an Ogre with the name Etalatta Fewd.  No one
has a problem with it, and I even gave him a tell giving him props for
haloding onto the name for so long.  He said he's been reported many times,
but GM's haven't had a problem with it.  And he's had the name ince the days
of Dynan, who was by far the most fair and loved GM in Fennin History.

Here are some more cool Fennin Ro names who have withstood the test of
pests.

Kilumall
Murdarer
Smasha
Larame Sigaretts (Simpsons fans will recognize this as a reference to Larame
Cigarettes)
Batspanker

and here's one who can be seen on all servers in North Ro, Spoolie Gee.
