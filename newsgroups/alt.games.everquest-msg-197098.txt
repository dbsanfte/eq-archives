In most cases, it takes 5 people who already have flags to get one person
their flag.  Yes, some of us were able to get flags for two, three, four,
heck, clearly some even got them for 6 people... but in most cases with a
guild thats barely powerful enough for flags, you need some level 65 people
to make up for the less well equipped sub 62 people.  If your class is one of
the ones that is less useful in the intensive High DPS speed race that the
trial consists of, then your groupmates have to be even more on the ball to
make up for that.

Unflagged, getting past 62 is extremely tedious, with very little you can
kill for decent experience.  A guild capable of fielding 5 level 65 people
who didn't already get their flags is going to be very hard to find indeed.

But they aren't doing that, they are only eliminating flags for the tier two
zones.  "Best content?" not even close.   "Gods and dragons" aren't running
around free for the slaughter in those zones, either, by the way...  They
are, however, easy enough to find in the plane of Hate, Fear, in Skyshrine,
in Wakening Lands, in Western Wastes... Perhaps you'd like a flagging system
put in place for those zones, requiring you to beg 5 high level friends who
don't need their flags to come help you get yours?

Because frankly, after literally over 100 tries, thats the only way I got
flagged, and I've helped many of my friends and guildmates pass trials the
same way; by being level 65, which I only got by having passed trials.

The biggest joy of this for me is not that my 57 bard won't have to pass
trials to get past 62... its that I will no longer have to show up with my
cleric time and again to pass friends and guildmates thru on a piece of
content I didn't like much in the first place, and have now probably done
over 150 times, including my numerous fails, and about a 60/40 success fail
rate on getting others thru.
