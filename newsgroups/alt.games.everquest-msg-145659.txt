Here's the text of the conversation with the new NPC:

This is the new NPC in Skyfire:

[Wed Sep 04 14:20:45 2002] Askarak says, 'Hail, Warder Cecilia' 
[Wed Sep 04 14:20:45 2002] Warder Cecilia says 'Greetings, you have made
excellent time. We received word that Zordak was gathering his power
here, and we still have little knowledge of his true intentions.
Scattered throughout these mountains there are small Pearlescent Shards,
binding four of these shards together within a Box of Binding should
allow me to create a Seal. This seal, when fused with a Swirling Pearl
inside Zordak's heart should allow our seers to divinie his true
intentions, even after he has been slain. Once you have the seal I will
release Zordak, make haste I will not be able to hold him for long.' 


Seems that you need to gather the small shards in skyfire then RF will
be triggered...
