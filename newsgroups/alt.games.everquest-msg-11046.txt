Maybe even more so.  :-)

At least the SK can console himself with the rationalization that
the HT might NOT have made a difference.

But the Paladin would have had a much higher chance of surviving
(even if just a run to the zone for safety) with the 100% more
health that the Lay Hands would have given.

And the only thing(s) worse than forgetting to use Lay Hands are:

1.  Remembering to use Lay Hands but fumbling the "target self
    before firing Lay Hands" step.  I hate it when that happens...

2.  Remembering to use Lay Hands but getting stunned for the
    last ten seconds of your life and being unable to use it.

3.  Remembering to use Lay Hands but holding off until the
    last possible second (so as to get the maximum benefit from
    it), only to discover that the "last possible second" passed
    two seconds ago (as when Lady Vox blows away that entire last
    bubble of health with one breath).
