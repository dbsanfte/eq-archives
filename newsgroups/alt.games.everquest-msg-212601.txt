1. I want an Area Effect Concussion spell for my wizard, so i can use those
rains spells you gave me in PoP without having to rely on tanks splitting up
the mobs and tanks using AE taunts. Especially since XP groups are limited
to 6 people we cant have several tanks, and now that you are promoting
grouping by big grouping bonuses and nerfed solo XP. You seem to give
everyone a good bonus up til 6 members, then if we want to group a 7th
member you totally shit on us.

2. Decession must be made to target other members in other groups in the
same raid (you should of never made anything call raid groups, it just made
everything more complicated for everyone including yourselves).

3. You should of just made the ability to add 72 members to a party. 20 -
80% for 5 players, then maybe a decreasing modifer like -5% per member added
from the 7th member onwards to 72 players. Window management could be easily
split up and group members could be assigned to different "zones" inside
that window by the raid leader so the healers can see only their "sub
group". This would overcome the problems of regrouping and structuring a
raid force.
----zone 1----
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
----zone 2----
7.
8.
9.
10.
11.
12.
----zone 3----
13.
14.
15.
16.
17.
18.
...etc. And the zone your character is in becomes what players your group
window would consist of. The raid leader can select a name and set the
number on that player to rearrange groups and zones with ease. Why do i
always have to design these things? Don't you guys have designers there or
something?

3. Wizards must get MGB for the constant demands for TLs to different zones
so we can move our raids without spending 5 hours trying to get everyone to
a zone. You gave us teleport ffs. Even hybrids got MGB now (Beastlord, ahhhh
but maybe i'mm forgetting beastlords can do everything in the game now, nice
way of promoting SoL expansion and shitting on every other class pre SoL).

4. Druids got everything in PoP. CH, AE snares, single 0dmg roots etc. Now
wizards arent even a summon pet/charm pet class and relys heavily on
roots/snares to win. You would therefor think the master of rooting/snaring
would be wizards!? Give us single target snare that doesnt cost 283746283
mana like our AE snare does.

5. Fix Al'Kabors and Manaburn!!!!!!! They're both a joke, and its not even
funny.

Simply,
UbeR
