Why not each distriubtion contract will be negotiated seperately - having
seen how well Planetside or other games of the moment the distributer may
wll be askiong for a bigger cut - but not enough for the megotiations to
be pulled and starting elswhere (or exclusive contracts might come in).

There may be issues with other supplier limiting distribution - I could
see them having given say Ubisft or whoever operates the Euro servers a
time when they wont release a competing game - they get EQ2 and SWG ready
slightly earlier than expected and are stuck on that...or the US
distributer may have demanded it for a cheap deal on US distribution so
they can export at a rate of knots.

Oh and point of sales people may be needed to get the UK campaign going.
Also this sort of hold up generates publicity - that means more sales in
the end even if you annoy a few people.  See what happened in reverse with
Operation Flashpoint. Ive seen all the above kick in on a WotC supplement
for a d20 game which was sold for a while....one argument and little
niggle, or a penalty clause executed and it throws everything.
