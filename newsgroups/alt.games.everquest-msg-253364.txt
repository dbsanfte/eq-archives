/shrug

In P&P its not even considered 'greif play'... unless the *player* is 
being the ass, not just the character. In EQ, if you don't know the guy 
ooc, you can't tell the difference.

Yeah, I already said the anonymity is part of the problem.

Breaking out of character, and reaching out to the other player is all 
that is required to resolve it though.

Not especially. The point was that ooc communication enables RP; it 
doesn't stifle it. Interacting srictly on a character-character basis 
stifles it.

Which vision is that? And where have I -insisted- it?

As a matter of fact, the *only* thing that I've suggested here that I've 
thought is worth 'insisting' is that if you are roleplaying and somebody 
else doesn't realize it you owe them the courtesty of telling them.

I get along just fine in EQ with the multitudes that don't rp, don't 
want to rp, rp-lite, and everything else. Sure I'd like to see the 
potential for RP improved, but I don't think anyone should be forced 
into it.
