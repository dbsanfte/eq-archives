Good choice. go to the EQdruids website lots of good tips there:

http://www.eqdruids.com/

The druid is a good all around class. You can melee a little at the lower
levels, you can heal, port, dot, nuke, sow, snare. A good jack of all
trades class.

Also, good choice. When you get to about level 20 start using the fire
pet. Their fire shield is more damage than the one you cast and it
will save you mana not having to cast it on them. Always equip your
pet with the highest set of summoned armor you have, it really helps.

Go to the mage compendium for good tips for this class:

Shaman are good soloers but the druid and mage are a little better in my
opinion.

If you ever re-think the evil thing. Go with an iksar Necromancer.
Their natural regen really helps with the hp>>mana abilities
of the Necro. Being evil and KoS is not a problem on Kunark
since its your home and there are plenty of places to play on
Kunark. Velious and Luclin have places that you are not KoS
or can quickly work up faction to base there.

Also, remember you don't have to limit yourself to one character.
I like playing lots of different characters, all the classes are really
quite different and each have their own strategies and strengths
and weaknesses.
