There is lag during peak hours, but you can tweak your system so that it 
runs pretty well. Turning your vertex and pixel shaders to -1 helps a lot in 
cities and on raids. I didn't have to buy a new computer at all. I'm running 
a AMD Athlon 2.7 with only 512 which is pretty low, and my gameplay is 
nothing short of spectacular. My Radeon 9550 works great and its not a top 
of the line card either. I've been very happy with this game, and plan on 
eventualy leaving EQlive. (I haven't logged in for months) I also think EQ2 
had a very clean launch as well. From what I know servers have been down 
twice, (Blackborrow and Guk) I'm not sure of the others. Still, downtime 
wasn't bad imo.
