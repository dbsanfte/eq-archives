If it were possible to buy items from NPCs for X, perform a tradeskill
operation, and sell to NPCs for more than X, what do you suppose would
happen to the supply of money in the world?

Tradeskills have always been intended to be net sinks of money. When
the opposite situation arises - veterans will remember pie tins, and
more recently cheese - the term 'economy leak' is used to indicate the
undesirability of the situation, and action is quickly taken to plug
the leak.

So I suppose to use your delightful terminology, tradeskills have
always been raped.

You can read a reasonably complete patch history at Allakhazam.
