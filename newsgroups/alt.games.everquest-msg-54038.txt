I bet that Verant would let Mesmer through, or at least if they don't
any more it's only because someone took the time to explain to them
who Mesmer was.

Yeah, celebrity, but an obscure one for this day and age.



I was just pleased when recently I had occasion to petition an "Arlo
Guthrie", that I didn't have to explain to the GM that responded who
Arlo is. I was afraid of getting some wet kid who got his entire
musical education listening to nothing but top ten.
