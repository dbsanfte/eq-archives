Wizards can translocate (push) to Greater Faydark, Toxxulia Forest, North
Karana,
and Dreadlands, as well as sending you to your bind point anywhere in the world.

Further, the teleportal in Timourous Deep will let you port yourself to numerous
cities
in the world, the ones I recall are

Rivervale, Felwithe, Cabalis, Halas, Freeport, Akanon, Kaladim, Erudin, Paineel,
Oggok,
Grobb, and Rivervale... every city in the old world save for Qeynos.  If you can
get
to Oasis, Butcherblock, Firiona Vie or Overthere, these places are just a short
boat ride (you'll be getting off when you zone in to TD and a long swim away
regardless
of class or race.  The presence of Halas (otherwise unportable) and continued
absence
of Qeynos is an oddity.
