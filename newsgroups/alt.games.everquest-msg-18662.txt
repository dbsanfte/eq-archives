Nono. People who follow Satanism (or at least a certain version of it)
actually do beleive that if their capable of taking something, then
they are entitled to it. If you cannot defend your own, you are not
entitled to it. It doesn't matter who gets hurt so long as you get
what you want.

It is pretty pathetic. As someone else said, "Enjoy the harvest"...
