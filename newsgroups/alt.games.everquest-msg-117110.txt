Nah, my wife's druid is having fun leveling strictly in dungeons
alongside my monk.  Outside until we were ready for Befallen,
but from then on Befallen, Paludal, Netherbian Lair, and now
they're in Runnyeye.

With Lesser Succor, damage shields, heals, root, and snare
there's no reason for a druid to level outside if they're willing
to group.   Along with the changes to (at least) Oasis and LoIO
they've also (IMO) increased the dungeon bonus.   It only took
us about 60 kills to go through 23 and under 80 (some were
light blue and we both took an XP death) to go through 24.

Other than time-off questing, we're leveling at least once a
night in pretty casual play.  Average time per level is still under
two hours and that's included the running time (and waiting
time) involved with Nexus Spires along with buying spells,
doing the early-level monk quests in both Freeport (Stonehand
armor) along with the sash/headband quests for Freeport and
Qeynos.

Dungeons have always been better XP than outside, of course,
but it's gotten even better since the low-level changes have
been put in place.  And, as long as the druid is willing to group,
there's no reason to forego that experience.
