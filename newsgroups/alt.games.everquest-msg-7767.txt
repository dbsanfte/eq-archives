Well, I camped -- twice this has happened -- came back dead.  Both times my
body wasn't where I had camped.

I petitioned the first time and got some help.  Guide found my body inside a
mountain (in Everfrost).

Second time in under 2 weeks of play, I started to wonder -- Is this a
glitch or something? -- so I petitioned and asked.  This time I was bound in
Crushbone and had camped in Blackburrow -- got to tired to play and so
camped prior to getting all the way back to halas for a bind.

GM shows up this time says 'hmmm... I'll report it as a bug.  take care'.

I don't mind the run back nor the fact that GM's won't help with
non-confirmable issues but when I got there a necro helped me track where my
body was.  Turns out it was 'somewhere' in the fish-food tank so I dove in,
swam to the bottom and started with a hot key for corpse...  no luck...  Not
only no luck but no sign of the body -- in a wall again? 'somewhere?'

Got out, did a /petition...  no response.  I understand that the guides and
gm's get hammered with whiners about kill-stealing, spammers, etc... and
they can get burned out on all the bickering but, when a legitimate problem
shows up and I can't get help (just drowned my char -- I'm dumping him now).
I figure I'll just go to the test server and run there.  Not as many people
and, if a problem shows up and someone is around, you will get an answer.

Normal game assistance, for the givers, has turned into a nightmare and, for
the players, a frustrating and unresponsive headache.  2 days 15 hours of
game time going down the tubes with this one but at least I learned my
lesson -- don't go where the kids play or you'll be treated as a kid by
burnt-out care givers.

Ciao for now,
