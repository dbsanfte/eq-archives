Too bad I never used the phrase "got into the guild based on a lie" when I 
was talking about his lies to Bob about first how he wasn't the Wiggo from 
beta and subsequently when that lie's transparency was shown, how the 
incidents were an accident and he didn't mean them.

What were you saying about reading comprehension?

I've never actually seen anyone on usenet admit to engaging in bestiality, 
even indirectly as this may have been.  Thanks for your candor.

Faned, dude, you're getting savaged on this thread.  It's really quite 
pathetic.  You should simply turn your computer off and go back to fucking
