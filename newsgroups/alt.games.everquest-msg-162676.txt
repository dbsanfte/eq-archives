Hands down, shammy and monk.

The monk is a damage machine with strengths and hastes, and the shammy can 
slow the mobs to keep damage to a minimum.

The other upside is that if things go badly, you can run with the shammy 
and feign with the monk, meaning only one toon needs to be running for dear 
life at a time.
