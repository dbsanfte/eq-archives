I'm starting to have a tough time with Taellaar.  He's getting high 
enough that I think he should get some sv gear before long, but otoh I 
still haven't managed to get his sta over 100 yet either - as you can 
see I sacrificed the neck slot to get quite a bit of sta in one shot, 
but I still need 17 points to hit bare 100.  I'm willing to sell/trade 
the jagged ice shard for, say, a crystalline spider fang (spider fang as 
low as 200pp these days on our server, and have heard anywhere from 1.5-
2.5k for the ice shard, although I managed to get it for 450pp a 
looooong time ago...), and I have a ravenscale coif (about 200pp if I'm 
lucky) and bracer (no idea) I'm selling as well.  So I could probably 
muck up a *bit* of money if necessary but, well, nothing in the 
suchnsuchKpp range that a lot of stuff seems to go for these days ::eyes 
Martin's othmir prexus totem bitterly::

Anyway!  Lousy resists, as you can see.  Lousy sta, as you can also see.  
Any suggestions for improvements gratefully taken.  Except "can I have 
your stuff". :)
