OK guys, since I work for PlanetEverQuest, I have recently interviewed a GM.
I asked him many questions, and one was can a team of GM's kill the sleeper?
He said no, they just wait for it to despawn. Now once it has been killed,
it will NEVER, EVER respawn (even after a patch) on that server again.
(Unless they get drunk over at the Verant Office and flip the wrong switch
=) )

Anyway, there are 4 warders, and when all 4 are killed the sleeper wakes up.
It has NEVER, been killed by ANYONE, on ANY server, and probably never will
be.

Hope it helps!
