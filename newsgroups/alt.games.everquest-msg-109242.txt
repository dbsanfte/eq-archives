But the thing is I am not playing against anyone. If someone else cannot
comprehend that and feels they are competing against me on some level then
that is beyond my control. There is no winning in EQ, there is no losing,
there isn't even an end - not to me.

They have created a multifaceted world, there are racecourses in it, and
there are walking parks. There are battlegrounds and there are tourist
galleries. There are fighting pits and there are pubs. There are a myriad
different ways EQ can be experienced. Just because some people cannot see
into this game anything beyond the "pissing contest" - the competitive side
does not mean the rest of the players enjoying the scenery and generally
goofing around have no place.

EQ is not a race to me - it is a <place> I go to unwind and relax. It is the
alternate life I lead. If you can't get the Quake/Monopoly/Boxing match idea
of winning and losing out of your head then we just cannot see eye to eye
and it is best left at that.

EQ is big enough for us all - kudos to you if you enjoy the competetive
side, but try to remember we literally are not even playing the same game.
Some of us aren't even playing a game at all....
