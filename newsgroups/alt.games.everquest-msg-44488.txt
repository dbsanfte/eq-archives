Or maybe not. In daoc you do the same thing but you don't sit down as
much. The difference though is that eventually EQ has quite a bit of
content and big quests for items and planes raids where you kills gods
and such which often don't have as much downtime and are more fast
paced. I don't know if Daoc has that.

Its kind of like AO, would I really trade the content in EQ to play a
game with zero downtime where I just constantly upgrade armor and
group for xp and can't do anything more while having trouble just
moving through the world because of outrageous hardware demands and
memory leaks? No.
