 True. Which is why I said "most of the AA skills". I've already got run
speed 3 and maxed my regen.

 As for not getting hit, if you pull in ToV you're going to get your ass
bit regardless of run speed. Thanks warping wurms. Most other cases it's
nice and works 'as intended'.

 As for the regen issue, since I'm an Iksar I'm apparently getting 2
points per point every tick. At least that's what's been reported on the
monk boards. I haven't gotten around to testing it myself.
