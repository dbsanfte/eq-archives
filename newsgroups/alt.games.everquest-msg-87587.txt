Hmm, can you summon food or water?  I *think* that's conjure and I remember
doing a bunch of it at about the time I got Creeping Crud for my druid and
found out I was fizzling half my mana trying to get one launched.

Anyway, if you can summon water or food and it is conjuration (lots of if's
here I know) - that would be a great way to raise it - little mana and quick
casting.
