There is no such thing as a downloadable version. The keys are unique and
can only be used to create ONE account. You won't find anyone paying for an
account only to GIVE it to someone else.

You have 2 options here:

1) Pay and Play.

2) Don't Play and go back to Solitaire. Or whatever you play :)

It is IMPOSSIBLE to play without a payed account.
