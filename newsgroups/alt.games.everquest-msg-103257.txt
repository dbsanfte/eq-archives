You forgot also the time it takes for the guide to finish the petition,
which often times depends on how long it takes the response from the
petitioner to respond to the Guide in question.  So if there is like 10
petitions in front of yours...  And only 2 guides, not that you know how
many petitions there are, depending on the situation, it could take up to
an hour or two for one of the two guides to get back to you, because one or
all of those petitioners have to give their life story or argue their case,
or actually have a situation which requires a GM to look into something,
and the GM is either busy, or not online, which then makes the guide have
to go into chat to ask the GM there...  Yeah, that GM who listens to the
other people rant and throw fits at him and wonder why he doesn't answer
all their questions the very same damn second they ask it.

If only people knew how long it takes some people to type a response, or
look up a question, not everyone has a photographic memory.  And mind you,
I do customer service for a living.  The job the Guides and GMs do is
tough, cause the people they get think the subscription goes into paying
the Guides and GMs, when the guides don't get paid and they try their
hardest to help, only to get yelled at or insulted for trying.
