It's hard to see how the economics would militate against the provision 
of separate servers.  Customer differentiation is a powerful way to 
increase profits.

Charging more for a non-logoed TV service might be an interesting idea, 
but I would guess that the idea is rejected for a variety of reasons, 
largely political; there would be vociferous resentment among those who 
dislike paying for anything.  Still, it might come.  How much do people 
hate logos?
