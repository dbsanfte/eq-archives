I used to have Kunark installed but then my computer crashed and I
re-installed with my old EQ CD (couldn't find my Kunark CD) and when I sign
on it still says Kunark registered, so I tried to take the boat to Firionia
last night and it crahsed on me.  When i get my char logon screen I see I am
in timouros deep, but then it bombs when I select the character....I figure
that if I reinstall with Kunark, I'd be able to log back in, but I'd also
like to upgrade to Scars of Vel if I have to go out and buy anything at
all...but I don't know if I should I go out and buy Kunark again and Scars
and install them both, or is Kunark included in Scars of Vel and can I just
go out and buy that....TIA!
