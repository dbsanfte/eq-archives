}The thing is, the judgement call comes on how recognizable and how
}likely the name is a "bad" reference. That's where the GM's job comes
}in. My opinion on the name doesn't mean jack if the GM decides its
}okay. However, just about every young American out there will
}recognize "Chronic" as a likely drug reference. The average American
}doesn't use the word any other way except maybe in school or talking
}to a doctor. There is a much larger likelihood that "chronic" on the
}name of a character in a computer game refers to pot than any other
}meaning of the word.

Just out of curiosity, I tried a little experiment.  Test subject was a 25 
year old female who smokes about 2 bowls a day and has all the Jay and 
Silent Bob movies on tape.  It was a simple word-association game.  I said 
several irrelevant words like "cabbage" and she responded with whatever 
popped into her head.  When I got to "chronic", she chuckled and said 
"fatigue".  When I asked why she chuckled, she said, "because I was saying 
'fatigue.'" I explained the purpose of the experiment to her, and she said 
she hadn't even thought of the drug reference.

}Given the average populace of an MMORPG, I'd wager half the population
}doesn't even know the "real" meaning of "Chronic". Those that do are
}also smart enough to know the obvious drug reference that it can be
}taken for and chose another name to avoid problems.

I dunno, I think people talk to their doctors more than you think.  Anyone 
who touches a keyboard has probably been worried about Carpal Tunnel 
Syndrome at some point, a form of chronic tendonitis.  Hmm... that'd be a 
good name for a bard. :)  I'd wager less than half the EQ population would 
realize chronic *could* have anything to do with drugs, until it was 
explained to them.

}Just like "Juggs"
}could have many legitimate meanings, but on a female character, it can
}just as easily be taken as a reference to boobs and get nerfed, so any
}halfway intelligent player won't name their character that.

True.  Like I said, go with the context.  Leave that male brewer named 
Juggs alone.  And let the guy with only the name Chronic slide until he 
picks the last name Spleefmaster.

}In the end, it's the GM's call. My petitioning the name isn't what
}gets a name nerfed, the GM's judgement on it is.

Yeah.  And without damning context, I'd say the GM lets it slide 9 times 
in 10.  So I wouldn't bother.  Especially since it's not offensive, merely 
arguably a "common word not found in a Norrathian setting."  I might worry 
about that more if it was on Firiona Vie.
