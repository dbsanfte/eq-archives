I think it all boils down to perspective. My perspective is that I
just don't care what somebody's nickname is in a multiplayer video
game. Petitioning naming violations is a waste of my time.

I also think it's hilarious that Verant can name an NPC something like
Master Bates, or whatever stupid fucking name that Verant gave that
NPC, but they will quickly change somebody's name if it remotely
resembles something from a book or a TV show or if it is deemed
offensive by some sheltered nerd behind a computer. I'm more insulted
by Verant's horrible sense of humor than by some 12 year old finding a
creative way to get around the name filter.
