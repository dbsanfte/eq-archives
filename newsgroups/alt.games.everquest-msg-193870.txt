For reference,  most Xbox's come bundled with JSR:F and another game (forget
off the top of my head).  I own the GC/Xbox/PS2 just because I've been an
avid gamer and received 2 of the systems as gifts.  I find that each system
has it's ups/downs - mostly limited to the library of games.  I'd personally
GC myself (I know it wasn't an option but im a nintendo freak).  But PS2 is
the way to go with the huge selection of games.  The xbox live is awesome
and they have Shenmue II and Panzer Dragoon : Orta so you can't go wrong :)
