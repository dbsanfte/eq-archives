Sorry to be contradictory but, this is from Absor.
(you can see it at casters realm here http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3670)
Is it intentional for there to be certain places where it is enterly pitch-black for charactors who do not have lightsources or
infravision/ultravision? And if so, what is the gameplay benefit of not being able to see? Also, if I could not get to my corpse due
to not being able to see the way, would a GM be able to rez me/help me get to it?


Yes, that is intentional.

Races that can see in the dark pay an experience penalty for that ability. Those that can't see in the dark will be more dependent
on light sources.

And, well, frankly it can be pretty frightening navigating new territory in the dark. The fact that some folks just don't see in the
dark adds to the immersiveness of the world.
