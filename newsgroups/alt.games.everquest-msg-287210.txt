Wasting Time

After the patch, I logged in the 24 ranger and my SK, ran the SK over to 
DN and down the tunnels to Zlandicar's room.  There, I proceded to do 
the least practical thing I could imagine: I PL'd the ranger.

With Zlandicar's Heart and a shield, my SK, buffed with all the DS I can 
  muster on my own, plus several DS items, would pull a mob deep into 
Zlandi's room and allow it to beat on him, with the little ranger 
pounding away on its back for all she was worth, theory being that the 
ranger need only do a single point of damage to overwhelm me since I was 
doing none at all; with Zlandicar's Heart in hand I didn't even riposte.

Of course this was doomed to failure initially, as it turns out the rats 
run when low on HP.  Ranger couldn't land a snare or root, so the SK had 
to snare, and all SK snares do damage; Festering Darkness outdamaged the 
ranger so no exp for her.

I set up again in the same positions, but now I had Clinging Darkness 
memmed in place of Festering.  Uh Oh, turns out the mob runs so early 
that Clinging only slows it down. A quick Lifetap drops it but no exp 
for the ranger.

Take three, I mem several snares.  Turns out Engulfing is necessary to 
stop the mob initially, but after the mob's HP drops some, Clinging will 
do the job, and this is the prize winning combo; the rangerling can 
outdamage clinging and having put some DPS "in the bank" as it were by 
meleeing the mob while its eating DS, also outdamages the single 
application of Engulfing.

An even better trick is to pull two mobs, neither runs till one dies, so 
by splitting ranger DPS between them so as to keep them more or less 
even, we get a much faster kill on the first and the second is very 
close to dead, clinging stops it and it dies fast.

Ranger also becomes more DPS as her weapon and double attack skills 
improve, she's clearly a PLing victim from way back as her skills start 
out very low.

Good news is it only takes about ten kills to level, and another 10 to 
level again.  She's killing desperately red to her mobs, and I guess 
there's a cap to how much exp you can get per level or she'd probably 
ding with one kill each time.

Bad news is because the mobs are deeply red, once they run it takes  a 
long time for her plus clinging darkness to take down that remaining 19% 
of their HP bar.

The point of this exercise (beyond giving me something to do while 
waiting for the spawn) is to increase her track range so hopefully she 
can cover all four spots.  To test this, I invis up and go over to see 
if she's in range of the second nearest one; at 135 skill she is.  Then 
I head off to the further two; she's in range of the third nearest.  Up 
the ladder and around to the fourth spot... Bang, my mob is up.

I wasted a lot of time and effort skilling up the rangerling, but on the 
other hand I needed to waste that time anyway as Vaniki wasn't up when I 
checked at 130 skill.
