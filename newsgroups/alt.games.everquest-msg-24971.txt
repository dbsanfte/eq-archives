My husband and I are newbies to the game.  We've played 1-2 times a
week for about two months now.  We ran into a weird corpse quirk the
other day.  His character died in Black Burrow.  He thought he had
died on the path to the lower level, but neither of us could find his
corpse.  After he died a couple more times trying to find the corpse,
he gave up.  

I went back into Black Burrow once more to ask if anyone had seen it.
But then, at the entrance I saw his corpse, and wondered how we could
have possibly missed it before..  I told my husband to log back into
the game because I found his corpse.  

His character ran right by me to go to the lower level.  I told him
no, his corpse is at the entrance to BB, and I was standing right next
to it.  Then some high level gnolls forced me to zone.  When I came
back in, well, you guessed it, the corpse was gone.  Upset, I zoned
back out and then back in again and saw that my husband was looting
the corpse. 

I figure this must be a bug.  My character died once and the corpse
ended up on top of a pillar.  Anyone else have similar experiences?  
My husband can't believe the amount of money we pay each month to
experience this kind of frustration.
