I'm not much of a raider, not being in a guild even close to raiding
nor having enough time to dedicate to such a lengthy process.  Just
wanted to get that out of the way...

This weekend I was invited to several pickup raids, or at least I
guess they were pickup though in one case most of the raid members
were from the same guild.  While there I noticed a few things that I'd
like verification on.

1) the rotation channel notifications vary widely.  
2) CH delay is sometimes not even mentioned, let alone defined.

The first raid did what I thought would be ideal.
	Determine order and spammers
	hotkey " CH on >>> %T <<< - %next_cleric is Next!
The delay was set at 2 seconds in the channel prior to engagement,
fine given that we only had 5 CH'ers.

The second raid was odd imo.
	hotkey was " CH [[[[ %T ]]]] xxx"  xxx being the position in
the rotation you are holding. ie. 333 or 444
This seems to lend itself to confusion if anything deviates from the
plan, and something always does.
Cast delay was not a topic until I mentioned it.  On this one we only
had 4 CH'ers so it was even more critical I thought.

Btw, the first raid was a massive wipe in under 30 seconds.  HoH
dragon that feared all the clerics but the tank resisted.  Dead inside
of 2 seconds.  Second tank lasted about 14 seconds then the dead.  No
3rd tank designated.
The second raid designated 3 tanks.  A named mob popped on us as we
were engaging the target.  Not all dead but failed raid.  Had time to
try it again.  Second time around did 2 things differently.
1) clerics discussed delay casting.  some of these guys were all over
the place in cast time.  I knew the first time we weren't gonna make
it.  Took about 45 seconds to get it together second round but it
worked out.
2) we brought in a warrior to tank.  original tanks had been SK,
Paladin, SK.  All went down hard and fast.
With warrior as tank and clerics finally getting a system down the
second attempt was successful and some necro got his 1.5 epic.

I got bupkiss but it was fun none the less.  Didn't join a pickup raid
for loot and XP after all.

But it makes me wonder; how do some of these raids succeed?  Seems to
me that without decent clerics it's over quick.  And I don't mean uber
clerics in the Ultimate Guild, but just common sense and a little
reading.  I've only been on 5 raids now total, and nothing of the
level of Time or GoD.  Cleric epic 1.0, HoH flag (I think that's what
it was anyway), necro epic 1.5, and monk epic 1.0.  All at level 65 or
better, so I'm no expert at this.  But it sure seemed to me like I
knew more than most out there.

Side note: raids are fun if you're not managing the show.  Just
showing up, buffing, and going balls-to-the-wall was a blast.  But
trying to get all us monkeys working as a unit is not fun.
