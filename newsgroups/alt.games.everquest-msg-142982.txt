I know some nice people with Bots.  I've considered
getting one myself, particularly after discussing
EQWindows and its implacations in terms of not
needing to dedicate two machines to the proposition.

Here's the thing.  I've decided I don't like em.

Back in my paper and pencil gaming days, you occaisionally
saw a player with two characters or more.  Heck, I did
it myself.  Thing is, those players (and I) weren't getting
the "this is me" experience that I really like about so-called
RPGs.  Whether I'm Role playing or Roll playing (ie enjoying
the strategic aspects of gaming) I still like to immerse myself
into a single entity, not spread out across two or more.

When I group with people with bots, they are distracted.  Neither
character performs optimally or even close to it.  And they
aren't any where near as much fun to talk to, since they are
busy doing twice as much.   There's little in the way of
personality, and I don't mean "they don't say thee and thou,
milud", but that even the most strategic of players shows
at least their own personal style... bot players show little
if any of this, unless "driven" is the style.

I play several characters on one account.  Even this is a
bit of a stretch, but I do have a bit of a different personality
with each character, by way of flavor... more to the
point, though, I think anyone grouping with any of my
alts would be hard put to say I wasn't "in the moment"
most of the time.

Plus Verant is only sucking down one account fee for the
limited service they provide*

Bergh, 60 cleric
Srimp, 34 druid
Llyric, 40 bard
what a combo we would be as a botted team!

* I say limited because they are capable of providing more,
and have acknowledged this by creating a server where
they do just that!  Don't think CS does enough for you?
Well its your fault, cheapskate, should transfer to the
server where we actually respond!
