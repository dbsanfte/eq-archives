I dont think tell works that way, if you dont put someones name after
tell, it tries to send it to the first word you type, no matter who
you have targetted.

/target Bob
/tell I'm going to WC

results in 

"no such user I'm"...

PS, a lvl 51 druid friend aided me in getting my iksar SKalt from lvl
4-9 last night, we did it in just over 2 hours, and it only took me
that long because I had never been power levelled before and was too
scared to go agains super red things...  If you want to restart its
not too late, but dont wait until you are level 20+ before having
second thoughts.
