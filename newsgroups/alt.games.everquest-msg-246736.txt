I have found EQ very difficult to quit, but CoH has helped me greatly, in
fact since starting CoH i havn't logged onto EQ once, I really should stop
paying that montly fee as well, but I only played EQ for 6 months so. . .
it would be easier for me to quit than say for instance someone who has
played for 5 years.
