Actually, I run with all settings maxxed and have no problems, even in the 
Bazaar.  Well, if I leave spell effects on, and there are are many people 
there, I will get momentary lag when I start my AE manasong, but it clears 
immediately.  It *might* have something to do with my rather overpowered 
system though (Athlon xp2000+, 1Gig Ram, GeForce ti 4400 w/128Meg).
