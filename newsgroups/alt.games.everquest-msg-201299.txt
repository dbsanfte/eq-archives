I got up to about book 6 or 7, but then there was about a year's wait 
till then next one. And I have never got round to continuing. To be 
honest right now I can't even remember which series that one is. I do 
remember enjoying the first few books when I read them (say 4 or 5) but 
almost all the fantasy stuff just tends to bulr into one for me after a 
while.
