Unfortunately, SK soloing differs a lot from Shaman soloing, but I think I
can help you. My strategy involved pulling a cougar to the dock or to the
part of the island that connects to the chain of icebergs. From there, I
meleed them to death. Did this from level 35 to 39 with averaging 1 level
every 8 hours.

Your best bet is probably to pull them to the aforementioned places away
from the other cougars. Then do the Root-DoTing thing you shamans are so
famous for. This will give you ample time to reapply root if it starts
running away.
