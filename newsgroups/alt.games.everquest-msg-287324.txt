It used to be that everyone would start as a precursor class: fighter,
priest, mage, and maybe a "tank" one or maybe those were fighters too.
Upon reaching 20, you'd choose which version you wanted - something

I don't know much about how it was, but presently the class you pick
when you roll the character is the one you keep, unless you betray.
