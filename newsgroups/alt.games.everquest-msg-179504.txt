Second BoT key-bag.  10-slot.  Not exactly easy to get, but it's a free
10-slot.  :)

Why is it a 10-slot anyway?  Only 5 things go in for the combine.

Also, one I got with many characters way-back-when is the tax collection box
in Qeynos.  I think my wizard still carries one full of spell reagents. 
It's also droppable.
