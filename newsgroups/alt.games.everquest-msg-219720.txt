The only way to be sure is to try it.  There are currently three MMORPGs in
North America that have done very well: EQ, UO, and DAoC (I'm leaving SWG
off because it is too new, and so still has a lot of players in the "we'll
forgive a lot of crap while we see if they can fix it" phase, whereas EQ,
UO, and DAoC have been around long enough to have established stable, large,
populations that are mostly happy with the game).

When a game is new and full of bugs, people can give good reasons *not* to
play it, but for the big three, it is largely a matter of personal
preference, and that can be, well, rather personal. :-)  A minor annoyance
to one person can be a deal breaker to someone else.

Take tradeskills.  I hate EQ tradeskills because of the interface.  Too much
dragging ingrediants to containers and hitting combine.  I like DAoC
tradeskills much better (although they still suck, in my opinion...just not
as mightily as EQ tradeskills), because there you basically put the recipie
you are trying to use on a hotkey, and then hit the hotkey, and if you have
the appropriate ingrediants in inventory and the appropriate tools, it makes
the item.

On the other hand, some people hate the DAoC system because it means that
every recipie is known.  The developers can't slip in a new recipie and give
hints like the EQ developers can, so there is no chance to discover some
weird new combine.
