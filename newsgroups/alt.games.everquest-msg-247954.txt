>Can someone explain how a raid works

Some people get together, one raid invites another, raid formed.


> grouping

Someone with some ability to herd cats tells some people to invite
some other people. Hopefully there's some semblance to sanity to the
group, but that isn't a requirement.


>, tactics

That totally depends on the mob being raided but as a cleric you can
be pretty sure you'll either be in the cheal chain, if there is one,
or doing splash heals where you can, or mgb heals, or something
healish.


> division of
>loot/xp

Experience is piss poor in a raid. Forget about the yellow message.
You might get a yellow bar of aa exp max in something like an earth
ring or bertox run.

The loot system is decided apon by those running the raid, or the
leaders of the guild doing the raid, and generally come down to either
a point-buy system, usually called DKP (dragon kill points) systems,
or a merit/guildleader fiat system where the leader of the raid just
says who gets what loot. Some small family guild raids and other
non-raiding types still use random, along with some open raids, but
that is very rare.

> pretty much everything? My cleric is getting to a stage where this

You're not going to be put into a position of having a lot of
complicated duties anyways, as a cleric. As the newest cleric on a
raid you'd probably get stuck with rez detail anyways; its unlikely
the raid leaders would trust someone that green in a cheal chain.

Oh, there's probably going to be a cleric raid channel, and another
set raid channel, don't forget to join those. And the raid leaders
will probably reimburse you for reagents used.
