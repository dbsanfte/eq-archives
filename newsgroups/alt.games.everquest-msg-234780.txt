Here's an analogy.

I set up shop inside the entry way of the phone company's offices, selling
pastries to the employees who work there, as well as anyone coming into the
building to pay their phone bill or to adjust their phone service.  I never
received permission from the phone company to set up shop in such a manner.

If the phone company shuts down my little operation, do I have a legal claim
against them for denying me my employment?  I wasn't bothering anyone.  I
was just selling pastries. Hey, unlike EQ, I actually made the pastries in
question, so it's even less an imposition on the phone company.

If I make a product and my supplier decides to raise its prices to such a
point that I can no longer afford their supplies, are they denying me my
employment?  Can I sue them?

When EQ finally gets shut down years from now, can I sue SOE?
