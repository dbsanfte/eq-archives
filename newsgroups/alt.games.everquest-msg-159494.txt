I've seen this happen to other people, but never had a problem before.
Today I try to log in and after I select my character there is a long wait
and then the program shuts down and I am back at desktop.  I tried several
times and it happens every time.  I also went into the advanced feature and
checked all my files and it didn't seem to detect a problem.

Any ideas?
