  Lower Guk, Tower of Frozen Shadow (3rd, 4th and maybe 5th floors),
Skyshrine (if you're aligned with the giants of Velious), Nagafen's Lair
(Sol B), Ry`Gorr Fort.

  The sheep outdoor zone option is the Dreadlands.

  I've spent most of my time in ToFS and Skyshrine at this level.  Some good
armor drops for paladins in Skyshrine (if you're not a twink).
