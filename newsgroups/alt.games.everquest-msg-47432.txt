hey everyone. im tryin to get my warrior up to top skill on everything in the
game (so far got 200 in 2H slashing and somewhere around 170ish in 2H blunt and
my question that i keep forgetting to ask while im in the game, is how do i use
the archery skill?

i dont have a bow yet but im assuming u buy bows and arrows since alot of times
they summon arrows or somethin in a group, but how exactly do i work it? do i
stand far away and um i dunno press a or somethin and then fight up close hand
to hand? or do i keep hittin it with an arrow? or what? or do i have to stand a
certain distance to do more damage?
