Sorry but the collects are definitely screwed up. Got talked into doing
one yesturday because there was a rumor tha they were fixed. Also, heard
from a guild mate that they did 4 and completed 4 just fine. Well the one I
did I kept track of how many mobs vs. drops we got. After. 2 hours run
we killed 94 mobs and only got 12 out of the 23 needed drops. We only had
1 death and we were killing constantly. This was a Tak dungeon, all level 65
in the group, normal mission, mobs were hitting for 300-380.

The problem is the RNG and its streakyness. Some people do them and they
are fine, so they think everything is ok.
