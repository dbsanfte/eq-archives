Both wrong. Well, the second more so than the first. I have
successfully FD'd plent of times with 4 DOT's going on a mob. The
catch is you can't stand back up until the DOT's wear off or the mob
will re-aggro. The second one is totally false. I've FD'd with a mob
still chasing me but a good distance away and it turned and walked
off.
