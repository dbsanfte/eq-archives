That's a bit harsh. Where'd he steal the languages from? Or
Middle Earth itself? Sure, the monsters and other creatures
were taken from old myths and fairy tales, but that doesn't
mean that he didn't invent ANYTHING...

Aside from all that, I always thought treants were original
with LotR. Not that I have researched it, but I can't think
of any myths or folk-tales with tree people, at least if we
don't count dryads, which lived in trees, and weren't trees
themselves...

Oooh, oooh, tangential thought: Is it true that Tolkien (or
his estate) claimed some kind of copyright on orcs?
