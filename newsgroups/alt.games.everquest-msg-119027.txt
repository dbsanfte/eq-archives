I think I spotted the difference, our assumptions are similar with one key
difference, my version is:

1) in EQ, there is no need, and therefore by default, only desire.
2) an item's value is only based on its immediate or delayed usefulness to a
player.
3) In pick-up groups, each <Character> is entitled to an equal chance to
fulfill his desire (to gain equally from the grouping experience).

I think that core to my opinion (again, maybe correctly of incorrectly) it
is the <characters> present and not <players> primarily have an equal right
to fullfil their desires in the said pickup group. To be more precise - I
assume a <players> right is secondary to a <characters>. A lot of people
will not share this assumption though.

It is hard to actually define exactly why I have assumed this. I suspect
that it stems from nothing more than "I would feel uncomfortable taking an
item that I couldn't use right away when someone else could". I would also
feel uncomfortable taking an item to sell that someone else could use right
away too. Maybe I am just a sucker, but it is something that is hard to
define.Why do I say "please" and "thank you" all the time? For the same
reason, I would feel uncomfortable not saying them and I believe that some
(not all) people would feel uncomfortable if I ommitted them too.

Anyway - I have to concede defeat based on the fact I do not understand the
structure of logic enough to use it without the reference point of a known
fact (A year 10 education has it's limits). I have no doubt there is set
procedure within logic to cover just such scenarios, but I am having a major
conceptual problem understanding this at present.

I will try re-reading the thread after a few beers tonight - that will
proberly help ; )

My apologies to Jkat Splat - I presented my opinion in a offensive manner,
which was completely uncalled for.
