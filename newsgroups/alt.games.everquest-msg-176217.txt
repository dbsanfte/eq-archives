On the *few* servers where he's still snoozing, he's there. Still sound
asleep in his bubble. On the servers where the post awakening, revamped
ST v3.0 is in place, I understand that the new warder replacements are
not showing up for duty and the area is empty. Can't confirm that
though. But in any case, the sleeper is obviously gone. Once he's
awoken, he's never seen again. (After his rampage across a few zones,
anyway, if he even does that.)

Looks like the entire script is even buggier than before.
