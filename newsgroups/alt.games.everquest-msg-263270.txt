    You have to make the trades completely anonymous. Given that you want 
offers to be posted in a reasonable time after they are made, and players 
have complete control over what they offer, I don't think this is possible. 
Certainly the system the original author posted isn't completely anonymous, 
since it doesn't attempt to control those two factors.

    Stopping twinking won't happen in a trade-based economy. The only way to 
really be sure you've removed it is to make improvements to a character be 
untradeable. That's a big sacrifice for a game that is supposed to be about 
player interaction. As for ebaying (of accounts - if items can be twinked, 
items can be ebayed), the fight against it has to be at the hardware level 
and not as part of the game's design.
