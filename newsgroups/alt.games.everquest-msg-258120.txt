However that presupposes that the guy refusing to let you merge has -let 
you merge-. =) 

e.g. if I manage to hit the rear of your merging vehicle, I was too far 
back to be effectively blocking your merge attempt in the first place.

And to your comments about fault: Cutting someone off, or slamming on 
the breaks can both result in rear enders during a merge, and provided 
you have witnesses, the rear-ender can be found not at fault. (without 
witnesses its much much harder to get fault placed where it belongs. =(

As in their door is in line with your front bumper? So when they merge 
you take out their door... and its their fault. ... Or did you mean half 
a car length of -space- between your front bumper and their rear bumper? 
In which case, I'm not even blocking your merge attempt, now am I :)

Hmmm... around here that line doesn't go away. You get a lane ends 500 
meters sign, followed by another one saying lane ends 100 meters, 
followed by a sign that says lane ends, at which point if your still in 
the lane (ie you haven't merged into the lane beside you) you will soon 
hit a curb, ditch, or tree, pole, barrel, fence, or building... or 
possibly all of those things =)
