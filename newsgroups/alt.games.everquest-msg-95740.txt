  Yeah it sounds weird but she's a good friend and didn't mind at all,
her alt and mine were coming back down from the moon, still bound
there, and the rez was more like a port than a rez, the exp didn't
matter really.  We just wanted to get it (the move back down) done and
play our mains.  Rez was really the quickest alternative in that
situation.
