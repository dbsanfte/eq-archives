<huge snip>

Excellent review. I agree on all points. Personally, I'll be picking it up
if I see it in stores, mostly cuz my friends want me to. :) Its not that I
dont like the game, I think its fun. I just dont have time for MMOGs really.
But thats the good thing about SWG, you can pop online for 15-30 minutes and
actually accomplish something! No sitting around yelling "65 Mage lfg!!!
Woo!" for hours.

Also, check out this fan made video, its excellent:
