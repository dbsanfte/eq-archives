I found a list of all slash commands the other day (don't have it handy, 
sorry).  You can type or create a macro that says:

/show_window inventory.Bank     (case sensitive I think) and
/show_window inventory.Merchant  (might have that wrong)

The first will open your bank from ANYWHERE.  You can't interact with it but 
you can go through and see what you have.  It doesn't appear to show coin 
info (or I've been robbed!).

The second will open up the broker window anywhere.  Again, no interaction 
(can't buy), but dang it's nice to be able to browse the merchants while 
you're off in Antonica doing your thing, trying to decide if you want to 
sell to vendor, destroy, or sell to players some piece of loot you just got.
