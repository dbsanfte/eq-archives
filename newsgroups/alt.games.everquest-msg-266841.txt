You can make your account all-access and that will let you play both
games. However there seems to be an oddity where this doesn't work for
the free month you get for registering EQ2 (at least according to the
wording of the all access pass). If someone can contradict this please
do, but otherwise you will probably need to activate EQ1 separately
for a month.
