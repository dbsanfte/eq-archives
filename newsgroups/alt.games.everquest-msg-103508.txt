Actually, I think it's just a bandwidth waster. I presume you have no
probs with this nonsense because the dorks that are attempting this
cunning stunt are abject moron who desperately need a clue & some
adult supervision. Do ya think? Apparently, April Morons Day was

impress us. I can do without feeling this important...
