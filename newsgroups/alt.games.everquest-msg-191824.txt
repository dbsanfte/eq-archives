Nope, a EULA carries the same weight as any contract. It is being
fleshed out in court, but, the law right now is that you are bound by
the agreement. If you violate it, you are apt to be banned, and if you
violate Sony's copyrights they can recover damages. They recover
damages with a lawsuit, which is a Civil proceeding. I know Sony has a
case. They may have other reasons for not pursuing it, but if they
asked me I would make it top priority.

Why top priority? Because people use plat making schemes to sell plat
for cash. People find cheats for cash. People commit fraud for plat
for cash. AFAIAC, Yantis is the crooked pawn dealer, he is failitating
fraud, which is Criminally liable.

SOOOOOOOO......

You are wrong on both counts, Civil liability and Criminal liability.
ALl they need to prove is that he buys the goods. He doesn't own them,
and he fosters a way to defraud people out of goods. That is Criminal
Justice 101.

He also is talking intagible property from Sony, and handing it off to
others for cash, EULA violation. He uses the EQ software to sell what
he doesn't own, namely plat, another EULA violation. HE uses the Sony
Everquest name and other trademarks, with or without permission, and
uses it for banned activities. This is the "Risk Management" every
single manager learns his first year in the real world, which he
flaunts.
