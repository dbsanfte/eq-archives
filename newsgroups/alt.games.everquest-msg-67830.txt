I have a 700 with 384 and I'm getting alot of lag in many zones. 
Shadowhaven is mostly unplayable, and Felwithe is pretty bad.  I'm getting
alot of lag in FV too, which is a problem because the beasts don't appear
until my young cleric is almost on top of them.

Most of the old zones are pretty much okay, it's mostly the new zones that
have problems from my experience.
