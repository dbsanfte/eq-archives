Easier to cast regen and damage shield on yourself, ensnare 4, and
stand still letting them it you until 3 are together, then a single
wide circle should pick up the fourth. Don't try this until 35 because
you need med-kite unless you have a very large mana pool which is not
really possible when staring at a spell book. In a few levels you
won't (usually) need to med-kite.
