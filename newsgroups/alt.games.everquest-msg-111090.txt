Most likely they have flagged some items dangerous to "mortals" in case some
bug caused a Guide/GM char to die or drop items
even if they are no drop, as a second precaution. I know things like this
happend in UO where Lead counselors somehow
could die and get looted or dropped items on the grouond, i cannot remember
which happend but somehow players
got a hold of speciality items. This caused all speciality items to be
removed completely from volunteers, only to remainon GM's
who could take care of it themselves in case it happend (by deleting the
item or such, with powers the volunteers did not have)
