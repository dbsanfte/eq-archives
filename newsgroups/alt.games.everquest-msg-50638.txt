Are you forgetting the "get flung across the zone if the stupid dragon
is facing the wrong way"?

Zlexak isn't hard, the key is treat him like Hoshkar.  Forget about
cute, subtle or any sort of finesse.  It's all about raw firepower
with that one...kinda reminds me of Sontalak.

But you're right, Zlexak is ALWAYS a messy fight.

Ventani is in my mind the toughest dragon in the game.  Basically he
combines Zlexak and Lady Mir in one--except the damn AoEs are harder
to resist.
