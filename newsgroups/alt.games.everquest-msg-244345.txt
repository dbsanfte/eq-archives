I played around a lot with the cooking ingredients, and with smithing. 
Not really with the jewelcrafting [other than to note that the gold 
geode combos give good tribute points=0]

Note to people working on tradeskills - if plat is not a concern and you 
want to use the tribute masters, there are tradeskill items [like the 
LDON temper armor] that give more than 1:1 tribute points to plat. I 
know people trash the tribute masters, but as a cleric of mith marr, my 
faithstone puts me right next to the tribute master, and I play at odd 
times and it is good to pick up the FT tribute if I cant score a KEI.
