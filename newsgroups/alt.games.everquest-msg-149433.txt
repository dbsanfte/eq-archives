  It does work, and it is great.  I /assist the mob all the time, to
make sure that the MT still has the agro.  If I happen to see the
wizards name pop up instead, for example, I know that I've got some work
to do, fast. 

    By the way, the worst class play I ever saw was on Drinal, a cleric
called "Superbeing".  He joined our orc group oom, but didn't tell
anyone.  He didn't sit down.  When we had a  full pull, he meleed the
whole time, never giving a thought to healing either warrior. I was one
of the warriors, and I got down to half a bubble of life, with everyone
in the group pretty much chanting "Heal Tea!"   I survived, barely.  
Ended up with myself and the other warrior doing bind wounds on me,
while this git says "Hail a scarab".  I ended up disbanding, and refused
to group with him ever again.

   Worst wizard.  He went full burn at the begining of a fight, got agro
(of course!) and then ran around room screaming for me to heal him.  I
had started at 50%, which up till he joined had been fine, but quickly
went oom trying to save him.  When I was oom, I said so, but he start
shouting "HEAL!" "HEAL"  "HEAL"! Would have said it a bunch more times,
I am sure, but he obliged us all by dropping dead.  When I rezed him,
someone else in the group said "Too bad you died".  He then told us
several times that it SUCKED.  I caught the drift that he thought it
sucked that I had let him die.  I usually feel bad when someone in my
group dies on my shift, but I didn't this time.

Worst Druid.  No snare (and we had no other snare capable class).  No
damage shield.  No nukes or dots, near as I could tell.  Went oom
healing the main tank at the start of the battle, stepping on my heals
(I was the main healer, and this was said before battle).  Got agro in
another fight, and ran away at sow speed.  I didn't realize this, and
wasted time looking for him to heal.  This guy wasn't a bad player, but
was just used to soloing.  He proved trainable.

Worst paladin.  We had a near TPW in SOLa.  He came back naked to help
with the cr.  I gave him a FS two hand sword so that he at least had
some sort of weapon.  He gave it back, because his 2hs was
non-exsistent.  I feel  that every melee, if handed a weapon on a CR,
should be better with that weapon then they would be with their bare
hands (Monks excepted, of course).

 I also refuse to group with ninja looters, but that's another thread.
