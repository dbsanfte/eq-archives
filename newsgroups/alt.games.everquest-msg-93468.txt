You might want to read the study at www.nickyee.com/eqt/home.html  
It shows that females are about 16% of the playerbase, and that women are 
significantly more likely to be guildleaders, and that they are 
significantly more likely to enjoy being in a guild.
I'm not sure of the percentages in uber-guilds, but my guild is about 15% 
female (not gender-benders, RL women), though they almost 30% of the 
officer corps.  I know officers in several other 55+ raiding guilds are 
women, but I don't know the percentages.
