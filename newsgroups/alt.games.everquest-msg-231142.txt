But they'll still kill you if you wander out that town... from a roleplaying
perspective, a troll might not feel much gratitude and might decide that the
kelethin elves are easy to impress (easiest faction improvements anywhere)
and what they don't know about your eating habits won't hurt them.

Evil doesn't have to wear it's heart on it's sleeve. There are plenty of
evil people in churches and charities. Evil is about selfishness... killing
other evil people because it's useful is certainly not a good act. Heck, I'd
say a dark elf killing dark elf guards would be perfectly in character.
Certainly the high level evils in PoK talk as tho they'd gladly rip your
head off, regardless of your race or religion.
