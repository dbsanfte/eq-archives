Gonna link two of your paragraphs here and explain something that a lot of
magicians miss.

Magicians play way different in groups compared to soloing.  In groups,
you'll want to summon up every bit of armor you can to give to your pet
(phantom plate, lev rings for AC or focus rings for HP, focus necklace for
HP, etc.).  This allows it to be an off tank if necessary (yes, the armor
does help some), and since you're in a group you'll likely be using the pet
as a dot most of the time and simply keeping the same pet around.  Pet
choice can depend on a few things, but I tended to use air pet in groups
because the stuns seemed to help out the most.  Water is also a good choice
for dps, or earth if you happen to be in a no-snare group.

Now, soloing magicians have another strategy available to them.  Disposable
pets.  You'll find that there are multiple ways to accomplish this.  I
always preferred to stay right up near a mob and start casting a pet and
tell my pet to get lost when the cast is just about done.  For this,
starting out with the fire pet is a great method, as that DS the fire pet
has is a helluva lot more than what you can cast on it (i.e., I think it's
getting close to the same as a level 65's castable DS at your level).  Some
people prefer to back up a bit, use earth pet and reclaim it right after it
lands a root and summon a replacement while the mob is rooted.  I never had
much luck with that personally, though some people swear by it.  :)

Don't write off the fire pet, though.  It may not have the greatest hp, but
that DS is knocking off huge chunks of a mob's hp.  When I was soloing, just
about anywhere between 35 to 50, the fire pet was my pet of choice because
it resulted in the fastest kills.

Pfft.  Got an epic magician that also has a pegasus cloak, and pegasus
cloaks on every other character I have over 50.  Guess I enjoyed that
novelty more.  :)  If you use bolts much, try keeping yourself flying. 
You'll find it increases your hit percentage perceptibly.

Magicians get plenty of useless summons.  This one is one of the worst.

Anti-summoned nukes suck.  I mem one every now and then just to remind me
how badly they suck.

You can (sometimes) gate in-zone and not lose your pet.

The big thing is that even with pets not aggroing, sometimes they still
can't path to you in certain places, and at such times they tend to pop to
somewhere else in the dungeon and start the walk all over again.  Sol A was
really bad about this (and a side comment, it's the reason I used fire pet
in Sol A in spite of it not being able to land the little nuke it casts,
cause the DS was good at chewing up all the adds back when mobs would aggro
a wandering pet).

Shard of the core was at level 34...

Oooo, OT?  I'd seriously reconsider the fire pet.  :)
