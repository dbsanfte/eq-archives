I wouldnt make a commitment I couldn't leave, no. Thats precisely
what Im suggesting. There is plenty more to the game than LDON. To
choose to do something you know you may have to leave where you
cannot be replaced and your contribution is vital to the success
of 5 other peoples efforts is beyond selfish.

Guild groups, XP in non instanced zones where a replacement can
be found, groups where you warn people beforehand and they accept
it, all that seems fine to me.

To take a LDON and expect folk to laugh off you wasting their time
reminds me precisely why raiding guilds get such bad reputations.

Yes, I'm in a raiding guild. No, I dont behave as you seem to be
suggesting one must to be successful. Yes, we've killed Quarm. We're
certainly not cutting edge like Afterlife or FOH, but we're not
exactly sucking either.
