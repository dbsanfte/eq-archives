There are two locks to deal with as I recall, the locked door to the 
building with the elevator, and the locked elevator.  One of those keys 
drops off of Kirn (I think) in The Hole.  The key may be No Rent, not 
certain off hand.  I always did it with a rogue.  One other method that 
used to work is to have a caster with a pillar effect spell cast right 
under the mobs up top.  That may have been nerfed.  I understand they did 
nerf the PvP G Flux method.
