I would not be surprised to find that people whom are offended by paying for
a service are going to cheat you anyhow. At least by receiving some money
prior to porting, you get more to show for it as opposed to 'trusting'
people that are not even worthy of holding a bucket of urine.

Although, I will admit that in the end, no matter what the original poster
does, he -will- get stiffed on occasion. I suppose that it's just about
whatever approach he prefers.

Until there is a "/lead-pipe-fight" command in EQ that teleports both real
life players into an alley so they can beat each other down with pipes,
people will make everything so difficult.

With that in mind, wouldn't a breath mint make you more appealing to screw
over? If you didn't want to get screwed, just stop bathing for a week or
so... :b
