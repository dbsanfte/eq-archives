If you mean the ports to and from Luclin, then:

To port to Luclin, go to a Nexus Scion, they can be found at the wizard
spires in Greater Faydark, North Karana, Toxullia Forest, Dreadlands, and
Great Divide (Not the dragon portal, the wizard spires near the EW zone),
say "journey to luclin", and you will be given a shard.  Hang out at the
spires, they port up to The Nexus on Luclin every 15 minutes approximately.
To port down from Luclin, go to one of the four portal pads, there is a
scion next to each one (two next to one), with a name that informs you where
the pad ports to.  Faydwer Scion for Greater Faydark, Antonica Scion for
North karana, Kunark Scion for Dreadlands, and Odus Scion for Tox.  Next to
the Odus pad there is also a Velious Scion.  That pad, will port peopl down
to Velious about 5 minutes before all four pads activate to port people down
to the other four destinations.  The pads port approximately every 15
minutes.

You do not have to pay anyone for those ports.

If you are talking about the other ports in the game, then you will need to
find a willing druid or wizard, whom you may or may not have to pay, to port
or translocate you to one of the many possible destinations.
