Overcasting and then expecting the rest of the party to wait while you med,
is such a typical problem. I notice it mostly in mages/wizards who announce
"oom" after a combat. Do they really think the party is going to slow down
pulls because they overnuke? I would have asked that you get a faster
puller, or tell them you're leaving that group. As an enchanter you can
afford to pick and choose your groups. I like to wander around invis and
find a group that looks good, than shout LFG.
