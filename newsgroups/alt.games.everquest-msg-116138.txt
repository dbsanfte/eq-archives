As a followup on this, a guildie posted that he participated on the evil
side.  He was a human monk, but everyone who joined the evil guild was
transformed into a dark elf.  They then headed to West Freeport, and
promptly crashed it.  The GM/guild leader LDd several times leading up to
the final crash.  Sounds like it was working perfectly to me.
