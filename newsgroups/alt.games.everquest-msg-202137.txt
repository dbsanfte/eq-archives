The same change that would prevent KEI from hitting below minimum level
targets should also effect the Spiritual line, unfortunately.  It isn't KEI
specifically that's being changed, but the bug that allowed it and other
high level buffs to stick to all members of a group regardless of level.
That should also mean that PoTG is out the window too.

I have a feeling that the buff change is coming in the next patch because of
bad luck (currently PLing a cleric-bot and KEI really cuts down on the
downtime).
