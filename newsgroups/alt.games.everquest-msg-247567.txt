Sounds like a string of bad luck or bad groups than real gripe. You are 
missing out on some good groups.

I do LDoNs with no melees at all and do just fine.

Enc-Enc-Dru-Mag-Nec-Wiz is an excellent group...

With one melee...

SK-Enc-Shm-Wiz-Nec-Mag is also quite viable.

Or

War-shm-clr-enc-wiz-wiz works well.

With my lowbie alts I've been doing successes (on 
assasinates/slaughters/ and collectoins) with just an Enc-Dru-Mag threesome.
