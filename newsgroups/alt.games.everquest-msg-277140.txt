As BM says it's daytime and, for me anyway, the whole point of moving 
accounts to a server sat in Europe was so that the updates would be done at 
the quietest time of the day when I'm a lot less likely to be on ... it's a 
lot less busy at 5am than mid-day in Europe!

Moorgard said it would happen and now they're going back on it ... I agree 
with what the CS say that it's not upto them or the developers but it's sure 
as hell upto the network/server support guys ... and they don't know how to 
reconfigure it so it's on the same update cycle as the French and German 
servers?!? .... God help us if they ever get a network fault then!
