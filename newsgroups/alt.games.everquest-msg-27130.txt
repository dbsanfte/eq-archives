I had the same thing happen and shouted to see if others had seen it.  No one
else had their screens that was.  I tried to take screenshots but I couldnt
figure out the key to do it.  Someone said it was the - key but I didnt end up
with any shots.

It was very weird b/c I was in BB and all the gnolls and snakes were humans and
making weird movements.  Im glad someone else had this same problem.
