Bzzzt.

They were already that high before the monk change was even announced.
On the trib server I was regularly seeing them for as high as 16 k or
more on the phase and as high as 110 k on the fungi. The monk "nerf"
has changed nothing, in fact it would have zero affect.

The phase is so expensive because it is a fantastic combo wisdom
caster item bp, such as for clerics pre plane. The fungi is so
expensive because its a super twink up item for any melee type (
or even druids and shamans)
