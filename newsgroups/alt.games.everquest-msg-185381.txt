    The problem is for new recruits. You literally have to wait until every
other person that could use an item doesn't want it, because you cannot
catch their points totals without playing for as long as they have and
getting nothing. So the people in the guild who most need gear upgrades
can't get them unless the items they get would otherwise rot, and if they
take those rots they further reduce their ability to get the better gear
available. If you wanted to recruit with a guild, would knowing that with
guild A you only get rots for six months discourage you from joining guild
A?

    Good points systems are set up as zero-sum as possible. So for every
raid, the sum of the points awarded to everyone combined should be very
close to the number of points deducted on the items won. That way you don't
get a huge points barrier for new recruits to overcome. Recruits start at
zero - no contributions to the guild, nothing taken away, and the other
players in the guild will either be slightly above them (given more time
than they've taken out in loot) or below them (taken more loot than time
given).

    AL's system does have a way to stop players from "resting on their
laurels" - a negative DKP adjustment based on percentage of raids missed per
time period. So if you get a lot of points, you can't go sunshine and only
attend raids that drop stuff you want for a long time. Because their system
isn't zero-sum, though, you still get people with insane points totals that
a new recruit simply will not be able to match for a long, long time, if
ever.
