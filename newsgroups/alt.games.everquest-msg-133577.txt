Use the scimitar - it has a much better ratio.  Your damage is only
one less than the hammer, while delay is five less than the hammer,
meaning you'll hit more often for almost the same damage.  As for your
second point, the scimitar has a velium shards proc that won't
activate until you reach a given level, possibly 20?  Others feel free
to correct me if I'm wrong.
