Strength (for carrying heavy armor)
dexterity (helps out with playing songs)
charisma (for mezz songs, less important)

TWIST YOUR SONGS!!!!  Try to keep 3 going.  Use group buffs whenever
possible to make friends.

You can wear up to plate armor and dual-wield, so the combinations of
equipment are endless.  Strength items always help if you are a smaller
race, like wood elf.

Good luck,
