IMO, the Froglok is merely a novelty race. I think little was heard about 
the Trolls re-taking the city because no one cares. Not because of some 
sort of general apathy, but because even many of those who play Frogs don't 
really take the race seriously. I never much cared for Frogloks as a 
playable race, myself. /shrug
