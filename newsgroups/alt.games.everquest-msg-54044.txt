Oh please. Do the math.

18th Level * ( +2WIS / 5 ) = 7 mana. So what's it going to be?

 +12 AC   vs + 4 AC
 + 7 mana vs +20 mana

What can you do with an extra 13 mana? Not a whole hell of a lot.

What can you do with an extra 8 AC? Quite a bit actually. More than
offsets the potential +20HP.

Post 20 THEN prioritize on mana and wis items. Until then, they don't help
as much as AC. I don't care how much you -think- you're not going to get
hit. I can pretty much guarantee that at 18 a druid is going to be in
there dishing out almost as much melee damage as the tanks, and they
SHOULD be in there. We don't go pure-caster until 24 or so.

A good compromise would be to pack both. Use the +Mana +HP items when in a
group, and pull out the Ulthork's when soloing.

*boggle*

They may not be designed to be hit, but extremely low level casters are
GUARANTEED to be hit. What are you trying to do... get these players
killed?
