You are generous. I think some account cancellations and diminishing
revenues probably had more influence than anyone's common sense. ;-)

Business Week magazine recently had an issue naming the Best Managers and
the Worst Managers in business. One of the guys listed in the "Worst"
category was the head of Sony. Apparently, there's been some disastrous
results for the company under his leadership. Given that corporate culture
starts at the top, it wouldn't surprise me to see whatever ills the parent
company is suffering from making their way down to SOE.
