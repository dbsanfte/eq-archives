Ok read though all this drivel and decided your IQ isn't much better
than freezing. This stuff isn't rocket science in any class, they are
all easy to level, every stinking one of them and melee easiest of
all. Sure some are faster and druids can be among the fastest but
what's easier than pull and bash ? Nothing....not faster, easier by
your own definition. The ONLY classes I've ever played that required
any real thought were bards and monks (monks only when pulling
difficult areas). The rest? Childs play literally, boredom is all that
can stop you from dinging any level you wish grouped or solo. Its the
player that makes the class not the class the player genius. 

As for grouping "skills" HA! Five minutes with any decent guide and 2
hours in a group and that's done friend, oops I forgot the IQ thing,
ok keep practicing by all means. Sheesh morons.....

Not so pretty when we insult others to make ourselves feel superior is
it ?  No point has to be made other than slightly creative insults
that pretend to be a display of intellect. Now have fun.
