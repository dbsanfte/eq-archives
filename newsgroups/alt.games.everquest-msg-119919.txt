My first venture into Runnyeye at level 13 was an evil eye nuking me to
death before i knew what happened, then followed by some begging and the
first time I ever let anyone drag my corpse; I was scared they would loot it
(thought they could =)

I also remember when I started I played in overhead cam mode like Super
Mario 64, as I thought that was the normal since it was what it started me
in, as well as really dark screen until I found a way to change that under
options =)
