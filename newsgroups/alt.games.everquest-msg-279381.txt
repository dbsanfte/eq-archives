I'm suggesting, as someone who obviously has played the single group game
(as most all of us have and continue to do), that the "hell" of single-group
encounters just doesn't compare to the challenge of raid encounters.  Uqua,
for those who have been through it as "first-timers", is a splendid example. 
Being in Time, perhaps a better reference for you would have been the Rathe.

And the first obvious response is "what about the 6k tank trying to handle
RS?"  And the obvious answer is "what about the VT-equipped guild trying to
take out RS royals?"  Be cognizant of your "place" in the game and actually
work your way up through whatever progression you choose and that 6k tank
will be a 9k tank and the VT-equipped guild will be a Time-equipped guild
long before they see those encounters.

Dunno, I seldom join.  =)  I do hear other missions mentioned, and I've only
grouped the Creator mission twice I believe, 3-boxing it every other time
I've been there, as the Creator mission *isn't* a progression mission, and a
lot of raiders are goal driven.

I see people in RS without guild tags all the time.  No, I don't bother to
ask them their history.  I also see people in RS with guild tags from guilds
that have yet to get into Time, which means that a person can easily match
their equipment level by gearing up with DoN and other single-group equipment.

But the fact of the matter is, you asked me what I needed hp for.  If I
don't need it, why would anyone else?  Are we turning this into a
warrior-specific discussion?  If so, I will create a one-group 10k warrior
magelo for you and put forth the exact same arguments.  =P

So what you're saying is that it's viable now, with five extra levels and
two more expansions worth of gear.  Ok.  And the problem is?  Wanna hear my
complaints from two years ago?  They're mostly irrelevant now...

As a *raid-geared* guild, in Time, we used two healers in the Ikkinz single
group trials when we first started them.  If you're not willing to do what
it takes, you won't get it done.  And you won't be getting any sympathy from
the raiders who go, wipe, figure out what they need to do/get to beat it,
and go back and try try again.

In response to #1, what authority do you speak from to claim "significantly
more time investment than raiders"?  Care to guess my /played time?  If you
got within 50 *days* I'd be impressed.  If you can find someone who claims
to be a "hardcore" non-raider who is within 50 days, I'd be amazed.  I am,
by far, not the most active player in the game.

My previous guild absorbed not one, but *two*, groups of people that fit
that description.  They do exist.  And when they are discovered by raiding
guilds they are often heavily recruited because of their obvious skills and
determination.

If you're wiping that often, you've jumped beyond your "place" and need to
go back and gear up some more.

As a raid leader for years, I've run into this with an entire guild where we
tried something and realized that we had no chance at all and decided to
come back after we geared up some.

DoN-ish gear *is* elemental gear.  Hell, it's better in many ways, comparing
favorably to Time gear.
