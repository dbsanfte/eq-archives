Well, yes, that's one reason I don't use W A S D for movement. :-)

If you go to the Options window, under Keys, you can specify up to two
different keys for each action.  So you could have W A S D for movement
and ALSO allow the arrow keys so you can use them when typing.  (Me, I
just always want to be able to type without having to worry about it.)

As for changing to a different chat window, if you do that by clicking
in the type-in bar at the bottom of the second chat window, then yes,
you'll be typing into that chat window instead of the first one, but
you're still typing so W A S D are assumed to be part of what you type.
If you instead left-click in the DISPLAY portion of another chat window,
that should get you out of typing mode so the W A S D keys should work
for movement again.  (Caveat: I haven't tried this myself, though.)
