What is the meaning to EQ?

To have fun.  I've never been into the experience grind, so I can't tell you
about making 50 levels in 48 hours and how exhilarating that must be.   Or
being part of an uber guild and killing the uber mobs first.  
But I've always loved making my own arrows.  I loved it even more when I was
good enough to make 2/150s and sell them at the bazaar for a profit.
I won't experience fight when I'm drinking, but my druid frequently hangs out
in Greater Fay or Qeynos and buffs and sows the lower levels while having a few
beers.   After a miserable day at the office I get a real mental boost out of
this, (helping someone else - and helping myself to more beers...)
I liked learning baking.  Not "power leveling" my baking skill to 120 - just
making Bear Steaks for the +1 Strength stat was fun for me.
I'm not a "shopper" in RL at all, but I love hanging out in the bazaar looking
for bargains and listening to the chatter.  I've learned alot about zones I've
never been in just listening.
I'm a ranger too.  Need help locating those Snow Griffons or quest people in
Knowledge?  Let me know and if I'm not busy I'll help you out.
I don't even get bothered by dying anymore - even at 52.  And it never fails
it's in Scarlet Desert or Sebilis or Guk or some other God forsaken hell hole
in the middle of the night when there's no CHANCE of getting a rez.  Once I
realized it wasn't critical to me to make the next level I started really
enjoying the game.
Good luck to you whatever you decide!
