Maybe, I doubt it but it's moot, VI did something annoying to keep
that from happening.

Who do you think is gonna cure those stupid curses that the mobs proc?
Sure as hell it won't be that cleric who's spending 100 mana and 6
seconds casting Remove Greater Curse while in the middle of the heal
chain.

Even shamans are gonna be busy maloing and trying to get
turgur/cripple to stick (or busy getting ganked from trying to get
turgur/cripple to stick).

I've decided to have paladins and druids (in that order) get the curse
removal spells--theirs is the least critical mana in any of these
major encounters.  At least as far as I can see.

Nature's touch does about 885hps.  On a fully buffed tank that's under
1 bubble of health.  Unless you have a BUTTLOAD of druids chain
casting this, it won't be as effective as having just one cleric
tossed in there.  Yes, complete heal is that broken.
