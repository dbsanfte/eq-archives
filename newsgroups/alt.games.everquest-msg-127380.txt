}Times are quickly changing as more people are realising there is good money
}to be made in auctions. Ignoring the ethics of buying and selling an
}account, the risks involved are absolutely huge and rising every day.
}Be careful out there whatever you do.

And remember that no matter how honest or trustworthy the guy selling you 
an EQ account may appear, he will always be the original owner, and can 
snag it back from you at a moment's notice with a simple "Hey Verant, I 
screwed up my password, can you reset it for me?"
