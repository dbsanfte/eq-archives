I don't get the popular dislike of ME.  In my experience, if you disable
system restore and maybe automatic updating - you have a Win9x platform that
has a whole slew of newer drivers for most hardware included and runs every
bit as robust (ROFL!) as it's Win9x bretheren.  It doesn't harbor any hidden
tasks that are any different than the Win9x platforms.  Anyway, for some
people with newer PC's and dial up - the  little annoyance of maybe
disabling system restore could far outweigh the hassles of updating and
patching a slightly older Windows version (9x/SE).
