Now that the Warrens provide a practical way for
players who didn't start their lives in Paineel to
get decent faction in Paineel, how do we get INTO
the main part of the city, since a key is needed for the
elevator that leads to it?

Is that key obtainable anywhere?  Or do we always have
to rely on a resident or lockpicker to operate the
elevator for us?
