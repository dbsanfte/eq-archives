These problems can be solved, but it requires several changes all at once.
Most new games seem to do many of these things, but it might be hard to
retrofit them on an existing game.

1. Implement item decay, and make it so using items that are meant for
people more than few levels higher than you will cause them to decay
rapidly.  People will now be interested in the loot from the low level
dungeons, since that will be what they will personally want to wear.

2. To deal with the problem of high level people farming the low level
dungeons for gear for their twinks, implement the trivial loot code again.

3. Trivial loot breaks risk vs. reward, since greens can still kill you, but
you get no reward.  So, change the aggro system: mobs low enough to not give
loot do not aggro on their own (if you start a fight with a loot giving mob,
the lower level ones can still assist).

4. Make sure any low level mobs that drop quest items or hard to find
tradeskill items have an exception to the trivial loot code so that those
items can still drop for everybody.

Note that #3 will also help to get people to spread out, because it makes
travel within zones easier.  People might go find some of those unused XP
camps if they didn't have to deal with hordes of worthless but deadly
greens.

Are these feasible for EQ?

1. I would have said "no" a few months ago, since it involves changing the
item database structure, and Sony/Verant has historically been reluctant to
touch the databases.  However, LDoN clearly shows they've overcome that, so
I'd say this is doable.

2. Easy.

3. Probably not too hard.

4. Could be a lot of work.  They might have to go through thousands of items
deciding which need to be flagged as an exception to the loot rules.
