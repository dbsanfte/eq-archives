I wonder how many of those people trying to level fast are (1) people who
already had high level characters and were now leveling up alts, and (2)
people who were on their first character, but were playing the game because
their friends do, and those friends are high level?

I think as a game ages, it reaches a point where they need to find some way
to cater to those who are trying to level up alts, or who are new but whose
friends are all high level.

There's the CoH approach (sidekicks) which helps directly with the second of
these (by letting the new player play with his friends) and indirectly with
the first (the alts can group with the high levels and earn XP).  DAoC has
copied the CoH approach.

There's also the approach of simply making leveling faster, which DAoC has
also taken, in addition to copying CoH's grouping stuff.  They've boosted
camp bonuses significantly, and people who have a level 50 on their account
can start new chars at level 20.  Oh, and they've added free levels.
Basically, every 7 days, if you've earned a level normally, you get a free
level.  (And for places where they want to encourage new characters, such as
underpopulated realms on some servers, they reduce this...one realm/server
I'm on has it set to 2 days).  This free level stuff is interesting.  It
basically doesn't really help the real power gamers much at all...if you can
do 20-50 in a month, say, you are only going to get 4 of those levels for
free, but if you are a casual player who takes longer than the bonus
interval to level, it doubles your leveling rate.

Perhaps it is time for Sony to recognize that EQ1 is now a high level game,
and add the big ZEM to all zones, rather than just a few like PC?  Maybe
even make /testbuff a real command on all servers, but only for people that
already have a high level character?
