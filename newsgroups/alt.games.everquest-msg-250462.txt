Certainly, but right now Sony doesn't have any particular incentive to
manipulate item drop rates or stats because of an item's RL value, and
that's where I see the problem.

Lawyers would have to sort that one out but my guess is that it would
cross the line to what the government considers online gambling. Right
now, since Sony doesn't profit from the ingame 'gambling', I don't
think anyone sees it as a problem. ... but I see this as a minor side
issue for item/plat sales.

Yup. I think they'd risk whatever they thought they could get away
with w/o pissing off their player base too badly. Whatever they charge
for an ingame item would be tied to the bazaar or time cost of getting
equivalent items, they can't just price them in a vacuum. They have to
be aware of drop rates and comparable items in order to price what
they want to sell, how much of a stretch is it to go from there to
starting to manipulate the other items (or just the stats on what you
want to sell) to try and maximize your revenue stream as much as
possible?

Here's the crux of the matter. I guess we differ on whether we think
Sony is currently trying to fix the game or maximize revenues before
it all dries up? I just don't trust Sony's judgement or motives in
that regard and to think that they would profit from item sales
without manipulating the whole in-game economy at the same time seems
absurd to me.
