I don't worry about a warrior locking agro over a knight class, just over 
me, and others casting on the mob.  If a warrior is supposed to be 
tanking the mob, then a knight class should not be actively trying to 
take agro from him.  I play regularly with a 65 warrior who has maxxed 
dex, and uses the hate proccing weapon from Xanamech, and it is extremely 
rare that I get hit, and I don't wait to slow with him tanking.  I Malos 
as soon as I can, and then slow as soon as I can, once in a long while, 
I'll get smacked for one round, but, that can happen even with a knight 
class.  If I really want to grab agro off him, I can, toss a couple of 
fast, high hp DoTs on the mob, and I can just about guarantee I will have 
agro.  A knight can keep agro off me even then, but he has to work at it.
