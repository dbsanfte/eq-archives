Hrmm, we use the new channels all the time on multi party raids, and haven't
had a problem with that... One thing that might be different it we all
modify our current pulling healing macros to this:

/gsay %t incoming, one per message
/1 %t incoming, one per message

In other words, we leave the original message and add the /1 message
duplicate.

*rant* Would a little "cut and paste" really be so unbalancing in EQ? Why
can't I copy my message and insert it and then just modify the message
slightly?*rant off*
