My level 5 monk is doing just that at the moment. They're a bit heavy,
though, so she'll sell one to the first vendor she sees. She also has
two tailored large bags after some fortuitious encounters with a bear,
some spiderlings, and a master tailor. She's l33t!

My level 3 druid would like one or two herself. One to wield instead
of guild issue club, and one to sell for spell cash. Cracked staff =
the first uber weapon.
