Yes, that's it exactly.  It didn't get any easier for anyone who had ANY
contact with physical security or criminal communities.  It got way easier
for you to realize how vulnerable you are.  And very slightly easier for
otherwise-incompetent criminals.

That was not my intention.  It may have been the intent of some Verant and
Sony employees, and some players.  The employees have spent very little effort
on that front, indicating it's not their priority.  That leaves some players
who are upset by it.  I sympathize with the anger caused by watching someone
do something you dislike, but don't know how to help.

Note that I'm still talking about macros and automation of otherwise-legal
activities.  Actual cheats (including ghost-killing) can be reported,
feedbacked, and bugged.
