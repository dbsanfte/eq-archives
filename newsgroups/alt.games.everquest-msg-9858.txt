Well written,

To you wanna be enchanters, i add this...

Make sure your char is agnostic at all costs
play about with the char generation as different races get different stat
bases

Go for HIGH int and char then add your points to these
lower lvls int is very inportant but dont under power chr

Chr affects how well mezz and charm works

if you are a high lvl char starting a chanter get him/her to buy you int chr
jewelry but for the 1st 10+ lvls wear velium fire opal rings 6ac 65 hp

as a total of 12ac and 130 hp will let you rocket up the 1st few lvls

If your in a guild make the highest chanter ya best buddy
( may twink you when he or she gets planar loot )
