OK, I'm a level 25 Necro on Luclin progressing along fairly well.  Or
so I thought until a couple weeks ago...  

As I was sitting on the dock in Oasis waiting for the barge, a fellow
20-something necro was inspecting me and commented that I didn't have
much "stuff" for someone of my level.  So I looked at his "stuff" and
his was indeed all much better then mine.  I wrote him off as a twink,
and went on my merry way.  Well, since then I've taken more notice of
people's equipment, and it seems he was right... I seem to be very
under-equipped and poor for my level (I have raw silk armor, +3 INT
earrings from the Qeynos Sewers quest, +2 INT rings made by a Jeweler
friend, and a giant snake fang for a weapon).  I see people my level
and below wearing & weilding all sorts of much better things.  So I
loaded up my pockets with all my savings (all 200pp of it) and headed
to EC to see what I could buy.  Ha!  I could have gotten a Stein of
Moggok, but it would have cost all of my cash.  A Robe of the Oracle,
which I see many people wearing, was 500pp+.  How do people afford
this stuff?  Do I have an unusually low amount of cash for my level?
I keep and sell just about everything I loot... maybe I am hunting the
wrong things?  Or is the economy so trashed that you have to be a
twink to afford things?  I see people my level buying and selling
things in EC that cost thousands of pp.  Should I be able to earn some
of these things from quests or drops at my level?

I guess I'm just getting frustrated that I am happy to get a bronze
weapon that sells for 1 or 2 pp, only to see someone half my level
drop 300sp on the ground because it's too heavy to carry (not that I
mind being there to pick it up...)
