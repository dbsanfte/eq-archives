Every AMD and Intel CPU currently available has a serial number imbedded in its
core.

Every PCI-bus card can identify itself by manufacturer and, if some form of
processor is included on it, processor manufacturer. Some GPUs even include serial
numbers just like CPUs.

Every network card has a unique MAC address (this is one of the primary pieces of
information that the XP hash key is generated from).

Maximum PC October 2001 page 47:

Your CPU serial number and memory size are also factored into the generation of
your Hardware ID number. [for Windows XP]

I didn't say a better OS, I said * the * better OS. There is a big difference.
