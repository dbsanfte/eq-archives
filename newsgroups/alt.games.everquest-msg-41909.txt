Sigh. ~_~  Didn't I just get through thanking you in my 
last reply?  Now I have to smack you.

Well, I have to take my frustration out SOMEWHERE.  Bad 
enough that an hour before my shift was over, someone 
told me about the arrests of someone with a false 
pilot's license and uniform, and of several someones 
with questionable IDs.  Ugh.  That was a LONG fucking 
hour. :(
