I have a question.  I see (for example)  Vhn27.26143$rh.470378@news6.giganews.com
in the message properties and news:Vhn27.26143$rh.470378@news6.giganews.com
in the message header.  Can this be used to get the original post?  If someone does
a lousy job of trimming and I want to see the original that is being replied to, will this
information help me?
