I don't know XML and do not think I should need to learn it to have 
the game windows sized and in the places I want them.

I really do not like not having a way to bind look up/down to the key 
board either.  I try to avoid the mouse for everything but looting. In 
WoW I have to use it to look up and down when needed.  Really gets my 
undies in a bunch.

I think WoW is a fun game, it just has several very annoying quirks 
that I do not think would be that hard to fix (though I am no code 
expert so I may be way off base here).  I want the numberpad to be 
recognized as numberpad keys seperately from their counterparts in the 
rest of the keyboard, so I can have full use of my keyboard in 
assigning keys.  I want a way to bind look up/down to the keyboard 
without having to use the hated mouse ;-).  I want to be able to 
easily drag, rotate and/or resize windows on my screen while in game 
just like I can any window in nearly every program since the beginning 
of the computer era.

That is really it for my pet peaves in WoW.  Not many, but with the 
multiple games to choose from out there things like this can and do 
make it easy for me to take my money else where.

To be fair I have some in EQ2 as well.  I HATE the tradeskill system. 
They made it far more painfull and tedious just so a few people could 
not macro their way to tradeskill nervana.

Sony billed it as "Every class can solo to 50" uhm... bull.  I do not 
play these games to solo, but I want to be able to solo effectively 
while I wait for a group.

Four characters per account? They should fire whoever thought that was 
a good idea.  If I am limited to a number per account and not server 
then give me 8 so I can at least try most of the different paths.

Zoning is way to time consuming in town.  The need for zoning is not 
needed (as Blizzard has proven) so why do I need to do it every few 
feet while in town in EQ2?

When I compare the things I don't like in WoW to the ones I don't like 
in EQ2, I find the ones in WoW the most game breaking.  They take away 
from the emersion more for me more so than the ones in EQ2.
