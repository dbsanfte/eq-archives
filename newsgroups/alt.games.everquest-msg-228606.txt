Reclaim energy does not quote gives back "a percentage of mana required 
to cast that pet." unquote, it gives back mana based on the current HP 
of the pet.  This is a crucial difference, since, at least in the case 
of a mage, the casting cost of the pet may well be less than mana returned.

If it was a fixed percentage, this would never be the case, and it would 
always be relatively useless (only relatively; at low levels it would 
actually be -more- useful, and also on a severely injured pet).  But 
since the reclaim result is -independant- of the casting cost, mages can 
use it to get back more than they spent.

Yes, in a sense I get back a percentage of the casting cost; in the case 
of my 49 earth pet, the percentage I get back happens to be 200%, thats all.

But its really inaccurate to say that, since if the pet is injured down 
to 50% hp, I get only 100% of what I spent, if its injured down to 10% 
(a time when I'm very likely to reclaim and make a new pet) I get only 
20% of the cost of a new one.

Also, if the pet has HP buffs, I get more back than I would without; 
even though the HP buffs aren't part of the casting cost.

At low levels, the casting cost of reclaim is more than what you get 
back even from your best pet.  But it might be interesting for 
necromancers and enchanters to try it on their level 49 pets or other 
pets that have lots of HP for relatively low casting cost.
