Wow, it's been a long time since someone's called me liberal.  Don't think I
have ever been called socialist.  Now, though I hate to rub your nose in
doggy-do, it's the most effective method of teaching.

First reply:  I refer to the OP's tripe as bigotted bull scheist.  Given
that the orignal post was some anti-semetic crap, that would tend to set me
up as being at least friendly to the jewish side.

Second reply:  I explicitly state that the Palestinians are guests of the
Jews.  It's difficult to -explicitly state- that, and then imply the exact
opposite.  Granted, mass media is good at that... but I'm just a
simple-minded mechanic, not bright enough to do that type of idological
caninie copulation.

Anyways, my response to that may even have set me up as a zionist, for those
who would pay close attention (a group of people that you, evidently, are
not in).

Third reply:  After you complain about the way Isreal's guests act, I say
Isreal may want to look into that.  Now, that really could only be taken one
way, given even the slightest degree of reading comprehension.  That is to
say, Isreal may want to review their entire idea of allowing the
Palestinians to remain as guests in their house.  How you took it to mean
the exact opposite of what I had said -just one post previous-, is beyond
me.

For the record, I am not a liberal, nor a socialist.  I am a libertarian/
lazzie-faire capitalist with very strong pro-Isreal views.
