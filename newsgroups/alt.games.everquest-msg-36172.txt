Don't feel bad, met up with a shaman and he asked me if you had to put a
point into chanelling and what it was for. This guy was lvl 40 + (can't
remember exact level, I have slept since then). Needless to say he felt like
a complete moron.

I am a level 16 Druid. I have at least one of my spell areas in the 80
range,
with all the others over 50.

And I just spent my first exp point in channeling to learn the basics.

WHY DIDN"T ANYONE TELL ME ABOUT THIS???

AAARRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!!

Ny channeling is in the low 20s, and my spells are working MUCH better
already!
