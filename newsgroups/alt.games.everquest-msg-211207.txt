As opposed to other laws which happen to enforce the non-objective views
of the dominant society of the time.
Please, laws reflect the aims of the society at the time they get
introduced for no reason than its what they want, thats what they are and
what they do. 

Society changes, views change and fortunately the laws are too.
Surprisingly with these within the lifespan of a generation that would
have been expected to have agreed with the laws in the main - thats the
positive Id focus on - indicates more than just the usual societal
generation based change. Laws lag, problem with our society - cant think
of a decent fix myself.
