What a rube.

You do everything but answer the question.  You can't answer the question
because you're wrong.  Plain and simple and I've proven to everyone who reads
this board because you refuse to answer the question.  Well, everyone except
those couple of butt buddies of yours.  One more time, how does me and my group
getting a KEI adversely affect your gaming experience.  I know you won't answer
but I like seeing you avoid the question everytime.  It proves how wrong you
are.,
