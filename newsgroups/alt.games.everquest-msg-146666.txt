I was thinking of setting up a service maybe for newbies where by i take 
them from say qeynos, port them to north karana, cast invis on them and 
lead them safely to highhold pass, then we follow the path to the 
highest point. Then i can levitate on them and they can throw themselves 
off the highest point down the pass, the view would be incredible.
I could travel down with them then port them back to west karana then 
invis them and travel back safely to qeynos gates.
Anyone think someone would pay for this?

Paul
