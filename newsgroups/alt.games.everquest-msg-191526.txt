You can take one tradeskill over 200 without using AA points. It will 
max at 250. You can, with enough time and money, take any of the regular 
tradeskills to 250 at level one if you wish. Level dependant tradeskills 
will only allow you to raise that tradeskill a certain amount depending 
on your level- these include alchemy, poison-making and swimming. 
Alchemy and poison-making are for those classes only.

This has nothing to do with cultural. Cultural tradeskills means that 
only that particular race can do that particular recipe in a special 
container- regardless of fletching, smithing, or tailoring. Tinkering is 
racial/cultural- any gnome is born with a skill of 50, and can raise it 
as high as they wish once they reach level 16 (and cannot raise it 
before that).

Hope this helps a little.
