And it's just one field that I may specialize in, correct? I prefer to 
solo when possible (though currently I need a partner or group to gain exp 
in an orderly fashion). That being said I do like my nukes, Evocation 
might be a good choice. The items under Alteration get used a lot though, 
so I might go that route. It's hard to tell, I'll see which ones I find 
most useful in the coming 3.5 levels and then at 30 I might have a 
decision.
