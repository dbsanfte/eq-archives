People in guilds strong enough to get members flagged.  A couple of 
people have already said, about my reaching 65, welcome to the start of 
the game or similar.

There is a high-end game, which is truly high end, and it only really 
kicks in when you've hit the 60's and are in a guild which can pull off 
the required raids, or can get into raids and get flagged through some 
other method.

The guild I'm in doesn't have the membership or the resources to raid 
PoP and get flags, and I'm not good at forming relationships with other 
players and keeping them going in order to get help getting flagged for 
the high end planes.

I'm not complaining mind - I find raiding frustrating at the best of 
times, and painful at the worst, and I quite enjoy hunting with 
guildies.  However, I'm never going to see the tier 3 and tier 4 planes 
(except those that only have level restrictions, like BoT, where I 
basically went from 62 to 65), never going to get any of the loot that 
drops from named mobs in any of the planes, etc., etc.
