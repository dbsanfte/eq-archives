A thought occurs to me (and with my current INT of 75 that's amazing
on its own)

Anon hides your class/level
Why does roleplay also hide this?

If you want to have roleplay and anon both, why not turn both on?
Roleplay should -strictly- indicate player preference, and anon
should function independantly of roleplay.

Either that, or they should rename roleplay to incognito, since it
-isn't- used to mark "roleplay" status by 90% of its users, and is
thus useless as a roleplay marker for the few who would use
it as such.
