 Since it's fun to respond to old threads...

 It's probably been said, but strictly ratio wise, primal isn't the
best. The most desirable part about primal is the buff and stats. True,
you can get the same thing if you have a pet shaman to follow you
around, but not everyone has one of those.

 Not only that, but some people would like some of the Warder drops and
not just primal. Once Sleeper has been let out Sleeper Tomb is a pretty
worthless zone for casters. You have three named golems which you can
easily clear in 2 hours or less and they don't even drop something all
the time. It's nice to kill one and have it drop 2-3 unneeded spells.
It's all about Risk vs Reward!

 My personal opinion is that Verant missed the ball on this one. From a
story perspective it makes sense, Sleeper free there's no reason for
Warders. However with the high-end game so crowded the loss of a
high-end zone hurts and leads to more crowding.  Plus people that were
working on keys miss out on seeing the zone as it was because the uber
guild de'jour (French not my strong point) was done farming it.

 I would like to see the Warders come back, maybe in preparation of the
Sleepers recapture or whatever. Will it happen? I doubt it. People are
complaining but Verant will just go ahead with their new expansions and
zones and hope people forget about ST since they can get their 'phat
lewts' elsewhere.
