No, I agree, it doesn't.  AC should be effective at all levels, that it
currently isn't is an embarassment.  Nerfing monks hides this to
some extent, but what about rangers?  I've seen rangers who
tank as well as warriors... because they got AC gear and HP
gear and went up over the chain versus plate slope.  I've
heard of rogues with AC over 1250 too, tanking merrily along,
capable of Evading to the SA whenever low on HP.  Get
your AC to 1250 and you throw away the difference between
plate and other AC classes, because the plate classes
Can't get any better AC effectively.

This isn't an insane difference, its a sane difference.  You are wearing
leather armor, you shouldn't be taking a beating.  Do you see
druids tanking?  No, you dont'.  And why?  Because their
AC and HP totals put them barely above the pure casters
in their purty silk robes.

But monks, now, thats another story.  They don't wear much armor,
but they get out of the way good, so they take few blows... each
blow they DO take is devastating, mind you, but there you go.

Insane is when monks take few blows and the ones they do take
don't hurt more than a skinned knee.  IRL, I've put on a suit
of plate mail and had a buddy slam me hard repeatedly with
a real steel sword (I make swords for a living) and its a lot
like being hit with that famous nerf bat.  We also tried chain
armor... that was like being hit with a real bat.  Didn't try leather,
frankly, I don't have the time to spend in a cast.

That is the reason monks are now broken.  There's lots of all/all stuff out
there better than the "best" monk only armor.  This shouldnt' be right,
but there you have it.  As intended by the designers, monks would have
to share that stuff with "all" other classes, so they'd only have a piece
or two.  But instead, since its a big upgrade for them and only a little
upgrade (if any) for other classes, they get it all, so you see monks
wearing not a jot of proper monk gear at all.

Coupled with their low weight bonus to AC, this puts them up into
the same AC range as "real" tanks, but they get to keep all the
avoidance that was their substitute for good AC.  They don't get hit
much, and each blow does little damage, best of both worlds!

Sadly, any AC nerf for monks will have to be massive to have any
effect at the high end, and then it will either have no effect on the
lower levels, or will completely kill AC at all for lower level monks,
because of the stupidity of the VI AC design; AC matters only
over a narrow range for any given mob, above this it matters little,
and below the range it matters even less.

This is also why the cleric AC buff line is of limited use; most people
are either so low in AC that it doesn't help, or so high that it still
doesn't help!
