Press the F10 key to put you into a full screen.  @ 1.2 Ghz and a GF 2
card, you should be able to run 800x600 or 1024x768 just fine.  Just
make sure you are in fullscreen mode (F10 will toggle you back and
forth)  The mouse pointer thing is something that will come and go
every so often when you use EQ in full screen mode.

I would upgrade to a minimum of 512 ram. Works alot better with EQ.

Not too sure there, could the be the sound card you have (didnt

hope this info helps...
