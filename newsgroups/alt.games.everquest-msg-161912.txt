the free trial would probably be the best bet since you aren't sure he's 
gonna stick with it.  Still have to give credit card or game card info 
for the free trial.  That's because they know after 30 days you'll be 
hooked, hehe, anyway, just make sure you keep an eye on your 13 yr old, 
sometime preteens can be mature, and sometimes they can be the worst 
players.  Just make sure he knows the rules before he dives in.  My 12 
yr old plays sometimes, most of the time he's ok but sometimes I gotta 
push him off and apologize to people, he doesn't always act 
appropriately.  (and don't even get into the things he's trying to sell 
in the bazaar, all newbie junk all overpriced.)
