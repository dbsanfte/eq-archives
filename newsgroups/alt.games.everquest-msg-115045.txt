/wave. Yep, that's the part of the world where I've been
hanging out.  But I don't really need to go to the island to
hunt wisps. Lenny is a ranger and we can find them with
ease.  Seems that many of the age appropriate levels aren't
hunting them, I would guess due to a lack of twinked magical
weapons.  Lenny and I did the bloodforge hammer quest (each)
and can spank them handily.  Also, the higher level
characters are leaving them be, since the TLC makes them
just glowing, bouncing, buzzing wastes of time.  
    The server-wide TLC is going to play hell on higher
level trade skills, I should imagine.  Don't the tempers and
such all rely on magic drops?  I know that at the very
least, Wu's gloves do.  
    Um....went off on a tangent there, sorry.  /bye

Annie <--- spend alot of time in-game running off on
