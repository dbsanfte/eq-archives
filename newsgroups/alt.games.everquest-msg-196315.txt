The East and West FP guards are the Freeport Militia...They control much of
Freeport and make the Circle of Unseen Hands look like boy scouts. North
Freeport is still controlled by the Knights of Truth, the Paladins and this
zone holds the Bank, they don't have too much love for worshippers of
Hate...oddly.
My advice to this problem...Kill the Militia...the Paladins will love you
for it :ï¿½)
