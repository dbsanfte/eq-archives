Everyone is self-serving you moron.  And if no one could buy an SUV
then they would buy something that differentiated them from everyone
else.  That's the nature of people.  If you wan to live in a hut in
the woods then go ahead, but the majority of people would want a large
house with guest rooms and game rooms and an entertainment room.  Do
they need all that, no.  Do they want it?  Yes.  Same with vehicles.
Get over it and write your congressman.

I would have a problem wiping out anyone's family but if it's a choice
of mine or theirs I will choose mine every time.  And since I cannot
control the circumstances my family may meet with on the road I choose
to err on the side of safer.  The bmw example is valid, but they
failed to mention what the opposing vehicle was.  My money would
always be on the Suburban over the Volvo or BMW.  I'm not saying the
other drivers wouldn't necessarily be safe, but the likelihood of the
Suburban driver being safer is higher.

Damn straight.  All the time, every time.

Look to the people cutting down the rainforest first, they're causing
alot more damage jeenius.

I am normal, as much as that can be defined.  I'm normal in that I
love my family and will do what I can to protect them from anything
and everything.
