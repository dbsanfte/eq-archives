What problems are you having now?  The message you mentioned at the start
really does sound like connection problems.

You're playing from your school...if you still can't connect by tomorrow
(lots of people today are likely trying to get the files they couldn't get
yesterday) call your network geeks that handle your internet access.  EQ has
lots of students playing...it's quite possible one of them are either
playing or know about any possible issues.
