If you're interested in RP and play on Tunare, check out the Wind
Riders / Shadow Striders. These are  a pair of guilds set up in
opposition to each other (WR are the light, SS are the dark) and
populated with some great RPers. Heck, one of our members left behind
a lvl 56 shaman with her epic on another server after she discovered
the guilds. ;-) Probably two of the best RP guilds in EQ.
