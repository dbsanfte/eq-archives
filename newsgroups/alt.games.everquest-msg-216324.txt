"reroll you character".

Put all the point u can into INT, as later in the day u will change out gear
without major INT stats and the extra INT/mana bonus early in the game will
help you solo alot better. STA is something u don't need to worry about
which sadly enuf alot of high level wizards do, and most regret it at the
very high end of the game. Forget STA, just play aggro well and you will
succeed. I put my extra points into AGI, as this has an impact on your AC,
which affects how much you get hit when you get summoned. When you meet mobs
that lifetap for 5k and slap you silly for 3k those extra points in STA mean
nothing. But... AGI can infact help you avoid it totally, DEX is supposed to
help you take less damage from melee hits, altho i haven't parsed this yet
and i doubt i ever will. Get your "consussion" spell as soon as possible,
plus your epic rune/force shield and those will save your life many times.

As a wizard, you want the largest raw manapool available, then secondary you
want to avoid being hit. INT and AGI all the way. AGI wont play a big role
early, but it will at the high end of the game when you are talking about
mobs might miss a 1k+ damage smack on you (no STA stat will help a wizard
against that). Even tho im a high elf, i think gnomes have the best starting
stats for a wizard.
