Man this story has brought back some memories, sounds very similar to my
first experience with EQ.

My first character was a human druid, has the same problems stumbling
around Surefall, getting killed in Qeynos Hills, getting killed in
WKarana, loosing my stuff, not knowing about spells, then not having
enough cash to buy spells, (after loosing my corpse in WKarana twice).
The whole time I was there, not knowing about BlackBurrow, I got to
level 5, and out of boredom and frustration started a high elf enchanter
and a wood elf ranger.

I am not sure when I deleted my druid, but I do remember the first time
passing thru Qeynos Hills and Blackburrow on my way to Everfrost and 
felt a little sorry that I had missed it.
