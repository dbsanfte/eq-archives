/agree
North Freeport is a piece of cake with the right timing. I only wish I'd
known these tricks back in my twenties. I actually did all the goblin
ear quest bullshit in highkeep and killing tons of orcs, then guards,
etc. If the poster can contact an officer from all the higher level
guilds that he runs into in that area, ask if you can be alerted the
next time they are doing Lucan. Even if your'e not high enough level to
fight him, all you have to do is run up and whack him once, or pop an
arrow/throwing star into him once and sit back and enjoy the faction.

As DK said, the bank is in North Freeport. I've never noticed any
distress from being KOS in East and West Freeport. If I need to take the
boat for some reason, a simple 10 plat invis potion gets me past the
rogues in the tunnels to the docks. Nothing in the W. Freeport tunnels
bothers me and I get to the bank easily. Plus, at later levels, you can
actually find some decent hunting *IN* West Freeport if you're KOS
anyway and dont' give a fuck about their damn militia faction. Hell, I
made two blue bubs last night just killing guards on the ramp up from
the militia house near the N. FP zone in.
