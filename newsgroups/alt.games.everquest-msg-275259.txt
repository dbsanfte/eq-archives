Why not?  You obviously either haven't read the constitution, or don't have 
the reading comprehension skills required of a high-school freshman.  The 
constitution is written in fairly simple language.  Your tossing around 
vague notions about "serving many different agendas" doesn't change that 
fact.  I doubt this power of judicial usurpation is part of the intentions 
of any of the framers.

How about we go with what Mr. Madison wrote?  It -is-, after all, the 
surpreme law of the land.
