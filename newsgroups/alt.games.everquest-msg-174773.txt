In respect to Bandits;
Female Half Elves are Druids and the Male Half Elves are Wizards.
I have had 1 sash off of a Female Half elf (in thousands of kills, and I
mean thousands) and never off of a male half elf.
Humans Male and female (including the Farmers that are allied with them)
drop sashes and bronze weapons.
Barbarians Only seem to carry 2 types of Bronze, Mace and Two Handed Sword.
If the Barbarian is wearing Chain and not leather then he's Brigand and will
be 14 - 17th level, he'll also aggro on any level.
At 22nd the Bandits no longer aggro, not even in support for each other
(Druids will still heal) and so are single pullable but they would have also
stopped given you Exp about 5 levels ago.
