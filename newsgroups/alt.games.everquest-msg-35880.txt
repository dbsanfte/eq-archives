Because everyone makes the same same mistake. Considered a right of passage
not to put of a point into [kick, meditation, ..., channeling] for ten
levels, then try to catch up.

Can't remember the name, jujub or jubjum or something, started a character
when the game first came out and didn't allot any of the points in the
character creation menu. They were up into the 40s or 50s by the time I took
my last EQ break. I think they asked VI if they could get their points added
and VI stalled them.

On the bright side, the character creation menu was changed so you couldn't
make your first mistake in the game before you started playing it.
