Very screwed.  I plan on trying it again, but my first attempts at cougars
were worthless.  I started out nuking a cougar to pull it, it comes to me,
starts attacking, decides this is no fun, goes running off, with well over
half health still, grabs a few buddies, comes back and smacks me, runs off,
comes back, smacks me, his buddies do the same.  I run off, outside of their
agro range, camp, log back in.  This was on the second island.  Now I try
the first island.  This time I root, nuke, nuke, root breaks, cougar runs
away from me, still at over half health, grabs a buddy, comes back.  I
decide that's enough, run out of agro range, easy to do here by the way,
gate back to Lake of Ill Manners, work on getting xp.  I have heard the
suggestion of pulling to the docks, I will attempt this, but given the way
the cougars acted the last time, I'm not holding out great hopes.  Everyone
who responded to my last post on this subject told me that this makes no
sense, and I agree, but that is exactly the way it happened.  If it
continues, I suppose I can /bug, at the time I thought it was just a new
feature of mobs in Velious that makes it a lot tougher to kill them.  The
other thing that I noticed, but I'm told is not the case, is that the range
on my spells seemed to be reduced, maybe the cougars just run faster than
other cats, so they get out of range while other cats never did.  I would
run up to a cougar, stop, cast root or dd or malise, cougar is still
running, spell completes, target is out of range.  I did this several times.
OK, enough whining I guess.
