Helped my RL hubby make the run the other day with his lvl 17 Dwarf Pally, I
navigated, he ran.  We just followed the river, no SoW, no Invis, just ran
and watched the area.  Keep your eyes peeled, and you'll be fine, 9 times
out of 10 I'm sure you'll have no trouble, and even if you do, the zones not
that far, seems like it gets shorter with each run back and forth.  Just
stay by or in the water, that seems to be the big key.  I have yet to see
the SK or whatever at the mouth of the river that the other person here was
talking about, maybe he patrols, and we are just lucky.  The spiders seem to
have no urge to bug him either, maybe we're just lucky there too.  But it
wouldn't be fun without a little bit of danger would it.  :)
