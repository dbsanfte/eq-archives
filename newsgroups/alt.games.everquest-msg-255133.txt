It is. I still DL the bigger post and, considering a part of his
message was links within the HTML coding that didn't show up in the
straight text, he kinda screwed his own spam... But that's beside the
point. Bigger post and the link being blocked weren't much of a
problem. Main problem was the fact that it was spam. HTML posting is
just a moronic act to smack people for as a "secondary violation". ;p
