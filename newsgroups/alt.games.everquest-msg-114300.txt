Yes, there is. It gets a little old seeing people blasting Verant for
something that IS NOT THEIR FUCKING FAULT and they have ABSOLUTELY NO
CONTROL OVER. It's the nature of the Internet. LDs happen with EQ,
they happen with Quake, they even happen with text MUDs. It's not the
fault of the remote host usually, and sometimes not even the fault of
the local client. Router hiccups, high internet traffic, ISP glitch,
ANYTHING in between client and host could cause LD, and 99% of the
time, that's where the problem is. Something that neither end has any
control over whatsoever.

But morons like this one decide that it's Verant's fault and try to
fucking slam them when it's obvious they have no clue what they're
talking about. "It's bad programming!" If you don't know enough about
computers to know that that statement is bullshit, you don't know
enough to say what is and what isn't bad programming. Period.
