I can see a lot of people very upset if items they are currently using
suddenly stop working.  I also imagine the inevitable decrease in
price of their item won't make them any happier.  Yes, this will only
affect older players (read most of everquest play base), and
benefit(?) newer players (how many are they getting?).  But if I know
people, people hit by this will bitch without end, and never let it
go.  I imagine that people who can afford to twink with things like
the fungi (i am one) are bored with the game and looking for new
experiences.  Honestly if i can't use my fungi, I think I would play a
lot less, as normal downtime in lowbieville is painfully boring (after
you been through it will multiple characters, its just damn boring). 
I don't think it will make me quit, but if I don't play much, I will
get interested in something else, and just let it drop, which is not
really a bad thing in my mind.

I think in everyone's mind right now is 'I wonder whats next?' and
perhaps a prized possesion on a twink leaps into mind (if not the
fungi). Uncertainty hurts an economy. I'm just wondering what the
effects of this will be.  Even if its just a few items like the fungi,
everyone will know about it through the embittered complaining of the
affected.  How would a newbie view this. Not knowing much about the
game, would hearing people complain about an item 'being taken away
for no reason' (or another distortion of the truth) cause him/her to
worry about their posessions?
I think the need to restrict item levels now are a sign of 'the end'. 
People are bored with the game, this will not alleviate the problem,
just serve to make it worse.  All good things must come to and end
(less they become bad things) and now is good time, because its
getting nice outside.


Just my 2 cents.
