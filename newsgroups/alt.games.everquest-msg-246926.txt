Did you say something, ez064842@vici.ucdavis.edu (Remington Stone)?

But the book with the flicker frequency stuff is in Norwegian...

Oh, this one I have an English book for (Henson: Visual Fields). 
Light stimuli is subject to temporal summation: the longer you see it,
the brighter it appears. This summation effect lasts up to a critical
duration, after which the point of light appears to have constant
brightness, and that critical duration is roughly 100 milliseconds.
Then there's the reaction time, how long it'll take you to turn your
eyes towards the light (saccadic response), and that's 250
milliseconds. So, if you want to find out if a person can see a point
of light he's not looking directly at, want that point of light to
have the brightness you want and don't want the person to turn their
head to look at it, you show them the point of light for 200
milliseconds (as done in automatic visual field instruments)

This has nothing to do with whether or not you'll be annoyed by
flickers from a screen or a fluorescent lamp, but thank you for
helping me study for my exam in 2 wees ;)

Actually, it probably does have something to do with flickers. 50 Hz
would be a blip that lasted 10 ms and then off for 10 ms. If our eyes
were faster at fully detecting the light, I bet the light/dark change
would be much more prominent than it is.
