Sorry, Ken, but I've got a policy about that sort of thing.  I got an email
from someone too, asking me to go to his website and name the person as a
bad player.  I didn't do that, either.

Y'see, I'm not here to trash anyone's reputation.  I'll cheerfully come here
and cheer for folks I think you *should* group with - for example, the
cleric in that group did a pretty good job, I'll tell the world that
Pooptwist the Frog has your back covered healing so long as you keep the
mobs off of him.  (With a name like Pooptwist, I thought he was the bard
when I first joined.)  I'm sure that if he wasn't trying to taunt dark-reds
off a ranger six levels higher than he was, Skye-something the warrior would
be great to group with, too.  Renben the rogue did a pretty good job, even
if he did give me the heebie-jeebies doing the sneak thing and going out
ahead of the puller.  He never brought back an add, though, so he knew what
he was doing and I kept my comments to myself.

But the as for the Bard From Heck, I'm not going to broadcast his name - for
a couple of reasons.  He could be a perfectly competent player whose dad
makes him share an account with his kid brother, didn't know the brother had
him logged in, and would have killed the kid if he knew.  Also, I'm a
give-as-ye-would-get kind of person; if I started trashing people's names
out in Virtual Land, I wouldn't have any room to complain if I was in the
same habit.

And really, would you need me to let you know?  If you grouped with a bard
who said he didn't know how to lull pull, didn't know how to mezz, didn't
KNOW WHERE GFAY IS FROM BB, would you need me to tell you he sucks?

I didn't think so.  :)

Tcharlee
