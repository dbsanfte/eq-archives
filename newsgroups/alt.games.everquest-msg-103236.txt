I believe Halfling Rangers start with Strength at 70; put all 20 points
into Str and bring it up to 90.

Get more strength.  Halflings have good Stamina, Agility and Dexterity
so don't worry much about these for a while.  Also don't worry about
Wisdom.  IIRC, Halfling Rangers start with Wis at 85 which is more than
enough; my Half-Elf Ranger (lvl 33 now) only has 65 Wis and has never
run out of mana during a fight.  Rangers are a melee class, first and
foremost.  Extra Wis will help cut downtime, (eventually) but should
never be made a priority.

Yes, small banded armor will last you a long time.  My ranger still
wears a few pieces.

Try and keep 1h and 2h slash maxed for each level.  This will be tough
because of the new 'increased experience' below level 10.  You'll do a
lot more damage with a 2 hander even after you get Dual Wield (depending
on your actual weapons) until you reach the 30s.  You might also want to
do piercing, though it will be very difficult keeping all three skills
maxed.  You'll get Kick at 5 which is also an important source of
damage.
Get a bow and start practicing Archery as soon as you can, it will be
the
slowest skill to advance.  Archery costs money because arrows cost money
(doh!) though you can fletch your own arrows rather cheaply; but don't
get involved with more advanced fletching for a long time, it gets very
expensive.

Have fun!  ;-)
