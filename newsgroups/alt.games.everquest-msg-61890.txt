If you leave a member of your group there, perhaps.  Even then it would be
up to dispute if that member(s) couldn't actually hold the camp without you
there.  If you leave, and you were solo...  tough.  It's now uncamped.  If
you get lucky and it remains uncamped for the time you are gone, then you
can get it back, otherwise whoever comes and *finds it uncamped* and decides
to camp it themselves...  well, that's how *you* ended up there to begin
with.

I know I log out at night next to what I've been camping, and when I log on
the next evening, I'd want my spire back thanks!
