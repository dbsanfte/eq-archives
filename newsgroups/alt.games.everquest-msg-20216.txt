Breaking a law that does not even have the potential to affect anybody (and
which most people are probably unaware of...yes, I know, ignorance of the
law...blah blah blah) is one thing.

Going out of your way to publically violate a rule that you agree to every
time you use the name, which can potentially (and easily) affect thousands
of other people is another.
