Where was I being a prick? I simply pointed out that if he had taken a
few minutes to read the recent posts he could have saved himself some
trouble. I didn't flame him, or call him names. I am sorry if it
"rubbed" you the wrong way.

Take a deep breath friend. Do a search on my name in Google and see
what I am capable of. Sure I flame and argue on occaision, but I am
sure you will find that I help people all the time. I even help people
in-game as well, despite your claim otherwise. I have written at least
10 posts today alone answering peopls questions.

Log into the Firiona Vie server durring PST evenings and send me a
tell (Tavian, Tavien, Khosh). I will give you all the help I can, and
answer any questions that I can. 

Help != Free Stuff (so don't ask for any)
