  The other day I was in BlackBurrow with my 25 druid, just hanging around
buffing people and waiting for a train so I could use my AOE to squash it.
  A 10 bard shouts train 2 or 3 times then zones out with nothing in tow.
  So I sent him a tell complaining about his lack of a train and next time
to make sure there are more of them.  I believe I said it in a joking
manner.  He sent me a tell apologizing for the train.  I assumed he didn't
know I was kidding so I sent him one back telling him my intention
here(hoping to squash some trains).
  He shoots me back a tell asking why I am talking to him and if I had any
friends and to stop talking to him.
  I was taken back by this and thought it was quite rude.  I didn't say
anything rude to him and often just start talking to people I don't know.
Needless to say I have added him to my watch him die without a heal from me
list.
  Was I wrong for sending him a tell at all?  Or was he just a 14 year old
prick with an attitude problem?
