I have group heal legs that I do this with, spamming out 105 points per person
per twelve seconds... which doesnt' seem like much except I also bought the
Divine Arbitration AA, which equalizes out everyone's damage, meaning that I'm
actually getting full effect out of the legs, about 3000 hp per minute in
heals with no loss of medding mana at all.  Also helps slow down the gradual
fall of the MA's HP bar, takes care of the occaisional riposte damage other
melee take, takes care of mild puller damage, works on necro and shaman and
mage (and other mod rodders like myself) HP to mana conversions...

Got to love that free regen; I was in Kael this morning jonesing for my horse
like you wouldn't believe.
