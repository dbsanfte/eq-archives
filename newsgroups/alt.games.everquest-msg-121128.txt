But thats like saying Tormax is easier to kill for my guild, than for your
guild... or easier for Bens guild to kill than my guild.

If the raid leader doesn't know the place well then he shouldn't be
leading.. theres lots of ways to remedy his/her lack of knowledge in a
particular zone.

Whether chanters are a dime a dozen or not surely isn't relevant?  Your ONLY
going to kill him because a chanter needs.. and like you said, on a pull of
3 who needs multiple chanters?

Last time I pulled a royals raid that included the Prince (it was a pickup
raid, tons of lower level and inexperienced players) I simply pulled all the
room except the prince (so he was the last pull, and single).

The prince isn't a tough mob, (whether its an uber guild or not), heck 1
good group that plays together well could kill the prince (without any ntov,
sleepers loots etc).. getting to the prince is harder than killing him.
