Hi everyone:

I have an infuriating problem, and I'd like to have this solved ASAP. I'm
running Windows XP, a fairly new install actually. There is nothing running
in my system tray, and when I check for background applications by using
CTR-ALT-DLT it verifies that nothing is running that shouldn't be. However,
when I play EQ a program in the background very frequently runs, and when it
does it places a very annoying second (static) cursor right in the center of
my screen. Apparently this program is called 'Messenger Service' - I can't
fully exit from EQ when 'Messenger Service' has decided to run, I have to
press ALT-F4 to get to my desktop. When I'm at the desktop the Messenger
Service is a small window advertising different things.

My questions is: How can I rid myself of this annoying program, I can't for
the life of me find the program to remove it. It doesn't show in the
add/remove programs ...

Many thanks for any help I might get ..

Stevie.
