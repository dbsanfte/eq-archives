Sebilis, Charasis, Chardok all have different exits than entrances
(Charasis has no exit, you must portal/gate out).

All planes either have their exit in a different spot (Air, Fear), or no
exit at all (Hate, Growth, maybe Mischief...never been).

I can't think of any Velious zones that are designed like that (aside from
Growth), I guess verant clued in on the fact that such zones were maybe not
the best idea.
