    Ragebringer is a relatively easy quest (at that level of the game) and
yields a weapon that is the (mainhand) superior of almost all other rogue
piercers. Just now with SoL are better weapons being put in.

    His posts on the Safehouse indicated he thought people would only do the
one branch, and that would be it. They'd never go back for a Mask because
that would require doing the quest over again and killing good buddy Stanos.
Um, whoops.

    Check the Rants section on The Safehouse, a thread with "Zipper" in the
title (there's a couple there now, so you may have to look a bit). If you
want a summary, think "There's Something About Mary", with Kendrick as a
young Ben Stiller.
