I *think* iksar can wear banded.

Stay in FOB.  It is, bar none, the best newbie zone in the game.  If it
wasn't iksar-only, it'd be filled with newbies of other races.  FOB is one
of the better reasons to answer "Iksar" when people ask "What race should I
choose?"

You should be able to stay there, or in Kurn's Tower, until your 20s.

My initial Iksar was created with Kunark first came out.  There were
hundreds of people doing that quest, and offering insane amounts of plat for
missing curscale pieces.  I was told that people were offering 100pp for the
curscale tunic.  Some people have more plat than common sense.

Head to the south after you enter the zone from Cabilis.  There's an area
around Kaesora where the mobs parade back and forth.  Good area for level 10
to 15 or so.  Large scorpions are there.

Yeah, it is.  There's only one "gotcha" that I could find - the sewers.

There are hidden pits and traps and one-way passages and stuff like that in
the Cabilis sewers.  Just stay out of them.

My second Iksar was a monk.  I started him back in May, after a friend of
mine told me how much fun he was having as an Iksar monk.  He's a blast to
play - ac bonus, regen, and mend.
