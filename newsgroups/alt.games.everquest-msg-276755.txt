Kinda

In what sense do MMOGs have nlimited equipment? In what sense are they
non-competitive? If I want to fight ghostly orcs for a quest, but someone
else is riding about on a horse training them then using an area effect
weapon to slaughter a horde in one easy go, then we are competing. So it's
kinda relevant.

Yacht racing might favour the wealthiest competitors, but if they start
stretching the boundaries by using winged-keels etc, then there's
controversy, and that's in a game where it's openly acknowledged that money
makes a difference. Usually airplane racing has guidelines too unless it's
specifically stated otherwise; you can't use a F-16 in a biplane
competition. In any case, all equipment for a MMOG comes from the people
running the game, and none of these examples provided are similar to that,
unless you count bribery.

I'm not aware of any difference wealth can make to scuba diving.

Which would be fine in a solo game but in a competitive environment is
unfair. You should not be able to buy your way into a guild which has
limited places, because you deny access to the person who earned a place but
doesn't have your dollars. You should not be able to monopolise the limited
game resources without having done the ground work that earns you the right
to do so.

Very weak rebuttal there. Just saying that doesn't make it so.

*You* want to experience the endgame without actually playing to get there.

That would be fine if it wasn't at the expense of other people. In a game
where everything is instanced, that might be fine. However, if there's
competition for any reason, games usually work to level the external
differences so that only game skill matters. Bill Gates doesn't get to pay
the chess master for extra queens, he actually has to play and win with the
same rules if he wants to to win a chess tournament as the kid as from the
most disadvantaged neighbourhood.

And people also used exploits to dupe platinum, skip content and kill
monsters whilst being invulnerable to return attack, and when they were
found out, they were banned. GMs were found to give items etc to favoured
people, and they were fired. SOE clearly feel EQ is a game, but not one
where they would tolerate the corruption you endorse.
