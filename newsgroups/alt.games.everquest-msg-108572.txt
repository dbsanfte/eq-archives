Get used to it. Not uncommon to see people shout for port to WC in BB 
for several hours.
My record so far is seeing a guy in BB who needed port to WC so he could 
get to Freeport. Not kos to freeport, and his response to my advice to 
take the boat wat that boats take way too long to use.
Get back 3 hours later, and hes STILL looking for a port.
