That was your and the groups mistake. Druid should always be primary
healer in such situations because the only thing else it should really
be doing is snaring and then sitting in most groups around level 35.
Its just more efficient if you have any melee tanks. As a shaman you
can slow and hasten the tanks so that should be your main thing and
you should only be emergency back up heal.

In that case really its the druids job to remove one of the tigers and
tell you that you are now the main healer. The druid can run around
resnaring the thing to get taunt and keep it busy while the rest of
you rapidly beat down the other tiger. Hell it could even charm one or
better yet, snare and fear the extra. Even if he did not have an
animal fear memmed he could have pretty fast.

He was an Xp sucker basically and a druid totally unaware of his role
in a group (probably a career soloer), off doing something else while
AFK since he was not primary healer or anything anyway. You get those
kinds of people every so often. Basically if a person is non
responsive and going AFK for anything besides using the potty they
should get the boot and not even have to wonder why.
