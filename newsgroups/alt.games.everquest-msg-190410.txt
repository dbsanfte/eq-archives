Eight thousand points minus whatever you had accumulated in the meantime.

You left off snare (Darkness line)... don't know what level you get this,
but snare is high-aggro *and* if it succeeds allows whoever the MOB is

Wizards don't crit for 8000 until the seriously high-end game. I've
never seen an 8K crit from a wizard nuke. I don't think I've even seen
a 3K crit. Maybe I wasn't watching. In any case, the wizard will have
allowed you some time to grab aggro in the first place.

The usual issue with grabbing aggro is slows and failed/broken mez, not
nukes, since the timing on slows is much trickier and more critical.

Which returns me to my original point... I agreed about 3 posts ago that
a 100% taunt would be unbalancing, so STOP ATTACKING IT. Warriors need
a better way of generating aggro. A 100% Taunt would be a bad idea. But
they need some other method to grab aggro quickly.

I know they don't, but I've never had a warrior tell the slower to just
slow as soon as the MOB comes in. I *have* had a paladin say that. The
amount
of aggro that a knight can generate short-term is just nuts.

They don't need to be the best in all situations. I never said they did.
You're putting words in my mouth; please don't do that.

They need to be the best in *some* exp situations, at all levels. Knights
also need to be the best in some situations. If there is any class that
is best in all situations, the classes need to be rebalanced. Ditto if any
class is worst in all situations... again, across all levels.

Currently, from levels 1-50 or so, the three tank classes all have their
advantages and personally I never saw any preference for a particular
class expressed. From 50-55 the knights are preferred more. From 56+ the
knights are always preferred. Due to the horrendous greening out of MOBs
at levels 61+, it's pretty much impossible to exp outside of the Planes
in these levels.

So there needs to be some balancing factor introduced.

More important than the other two, which doesn't make the other two
*unimportant*. You might have T=5H+7M+13A, (T = "tankness", H=HP,
7=mitigation, A=ability to hold aggro)... basically it's still relative.

Better mitigation comes with defensive - plate mitigation is the same across
classes (even clerics). Paladins and SKs can avoid more damage with fear,
snare, blind, stun, LoH... so avoiding melee damage is less of a big deal
than with warriors. So I wouldn't be so sure about the mitigation advantage,
especially when you add the soft AC cap (AC greater than 1200 or so helps
very little).

I keep bringing it up because if they're second-rate in groups, they're
stuck soloing. It's a balance issue.

Speaking for myself - you're imagining it. Go /anon some time and watch
the "group looking for..." shouts. They're looking for tanks, not some
*particular* tank.

Having two people draw damage is not a good thing in an exp group once
CHeal becomes common. You want *one* person to draw damage. Otherwise you
get the same problem with mana-wasting microheals, except that the second
person is not doing as much DPS (but is more likely to survive).

If you're in your mid-30s then you probably haven't seen how CHeal changes
cleric healing strategies. Prior to level 45 or so, the cleric usually tries
to keep everybody at or near full health. The heals used are reasonably
quick to cast, but not very efficient. (While we get CHeal at 39, tanks at
that point don't usually have enough HP for it to be worthwhile.)

When CHeal becomes common, the cleric usually picks one person (the tank)
and tries to have their HP as low as possible when the heal hits without
them actually dying - usually around 20-30% HP. However, CHeal also takes
ten seconds to cast. During that time, the cleric can't heal anybody else
except by cancelling the heal (and casting a topup heal later) - so bad
aggro management is a very Bad Idea.

When two tanks share aggro, one of them will get the main tank treatment
and the other doesn't. Result: lots of microheals, horrible mana efficiency,
and large slabs of downtime.

I keep raising it because it's another area where warriors suck raw eggs.
Poor aggro control would be less of a deal if they could at least get decent
exp solo... which they can't.

Probably true... maybe boost the exp bonuses for groups, or have more
spells and abilities with a group focus. eg. when paladins group everybody
gets +50 AC [protection from evil]; when SKs group the MOB starts fleeing
earlier; when druids group animals don't aggro on group members... rogues
improve cash loot by 10%... that sort of thing.

SKs also get a snare and various life tap sorts of spells, as well as a pet.
Pet doesn't help much, but can keep the MOB occupied while you run.

Boosting their Bind Wounds would certainly help, but when most MOBs will
kill them before they can kill the MOB, it's not *much* of a help. Bind
Wounds is not very useful during combat, and one of the main single
disadvantages for a warrior is that they cannot escape easily from a
bad pull or an add when soloing. Paldins and SKs can. (Blind, root, stun
for paladins; snare, pet, fear for SKs.)

Agreed.

However, warriors have three theatres to work in:
1. Solo - forget about it.
2. Raids - Preferred, but the number of "slots" for top warriors in raids
   is very limited.
3. Grouped - Knights are preferred in PoP groups. Below PoP, in *my*
   experience, the tanks were treated identically.

Compare with Knights:
1. Solo - difficult but doable.
2. Raids - secondary tank/DPS at best.
3. Grouped - Preferred in PoP groups.

So Warriors give up soloing and have a reduced chance at high level
grouping,
in exchange for preeminence at raids (due to disc defensive and lots of HP.)
I disagree that their raid role compensates for the rest of it. You don't
exp in raids, and you need exp to get to the point where you're useful in
raids.

In my experience there just aren't as many warriors around as there are
paladins and SKs. Which is an alternative explanation for why you don't
see as many warriors LFG.

Warrior DPS << rogue DPS, monk DPS, ranger DPS... several others, you know
the list. I don't know about vs. the Knights, I haven't done the parses.
but the Warrior's DPS doesn't figure when they're tanking and have the
dedicated damage dealers to compete with.

Nobody's trying to squish you; just give you both a fair chance, which is

Or a cleric. :-) Clericking has its own issues, of course, but that's not
the topic at hand. (grumble peridots grumble).

Personally I don't care a lot about raiding; I don't raid very often.

Currently warriors are worst (outright worst overall) for soloing and
basically second-rate for PoP groups, probably about even for other groups.
Every exp group I was in that needed a tank was looking for a *tank*, not
a warrior, but a tank - warrior/paladin/SK.

From level 34 onwards, clerics are usually preferred for the healing spot
in a group, but I never saw the same level of preference with regard to
tanks. (34 is when we get Sup Heal BTW - until then there are 5-level
overlaps when Druids have the same healing lineup as clerics.)

About 5 months ago, roughly.

So there may be some of that. Question is, are you having the same problem?
I know that in my 30s paladins, SKs and Warriors were treated pretty much
the same - by me anyway. I can't speak for other groups. Perhaps I just
didn't know any better. :-)

I loved paladins because they can double as great emergency healers with
LoH, and did pretty well with SKs as well - the skellie pet was nifty, and
snare a godsend.

The latter covers a lot of pickup groups; I play in a lot of pickup
groups. I'm not in a big guild, and play at times when most of Cazic Thule
is elsewhere, weeknights - a time zone thing.

I might also point out that in the high 60s, there is effectively no
alternative for grouping *other* than PoP; everything else has greened out.
I'm not there yet myself.

Basically, somebody good at their role can shine in a poor group. Though
an overenthusiastic wizard is difficult to compensate for. :-) Early-nuking
wizards are an excellent example of evolution in action...

I don't think anybody wants that (except warriors perhaps) but I've
said it before and I'll say it again: the pendulum has swung too far in
the other direction.

Maybe I wasn't joining the dots - my 58 cleric is my highest level by an
enormous margin (next highest is 16... a paladin). Pre-PoP I had no
preference between the tank classes. In PoP the knights are getting an edge,
and that edge is not terribly fair given their other disadvantages.

I agree, but they do need to be better than knights in SOME exp situations,
and presently that is not the case. Our guild's 65 warrior spends most of
his time farming green LoY MOBs.

I probably won't follow this up further; I suspect we'll have to agree to
disagree.

To summarise, since the length of this post is getting out of control.
1. Up to level 50 or so, knights and warriors were treated pretty much
   equally in my experience. As the cleric, I probably saw people
   *seeking* a tank more often than you did, and warrior vs. knight
   simply didn't crop up.
2. In PoP, knights are preferred in the Planes. This is because they are
   much better at grabbing aggro.
3. From 61+, the Planes are the only place to reliably earn experience.
   This leaves Warriors with no situation in which they are preferred to
   knights for experience groups.
   Ergo, from 61+ Warriors are left *only* with raids as their preferred
role.
4. You don't earn (much) experience in raids, so I don't care whether
   warriors are preferred for them.
5. Warriors are hopeless soloers from about level 30 onwards. Knights can't
   solo well, but it is an option for them.
6. Net from above: from 50+ warriors are regarded as undesirable for groups
   relative to knights, cannot solo, and thus are only preferred in a raid
   situation. They need something to counterbalance this; either an ability
   to solo effectively, or some offsetting advantage that gives them
   *similar* desirability to knights in the Planes. Some form of improved
   aggro generation seems to be desirable to remedy this.

Or as somebody else put it... warriors need some lovin'. :-)
