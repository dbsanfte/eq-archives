I would think that on a server like Sullon Zek, that followers of Rodcet
Nife should be allowed to heal Neutrals, simply because it is the nature of
a follower of Rodcet (especially since the NPC's there still say the Temple
of Karana has an alliance with the Temples of Truth and Life).

Have you taken a Rodcetian newbie cleric into the headquarters of the Circle
of Unseen Hands?  They con indifferent down there.... able to get quest
details from NPC's.  What other Good religion can do that?  Why?  Because
they are known for healing whomever is in need...including some who are a
bit on the 'shady' side.
