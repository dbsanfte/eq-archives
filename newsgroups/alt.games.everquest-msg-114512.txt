>Need before greed, and seniority is the best way to go for guild >>


Crap! That's thinly disguised favoritism pure and simple unless, the guild
leadership is truly objective and not into playing favorites which seems rarely
to be the case.

Allow all members on the raid who can equip the item roll for it. If a raid
member wins one roll, he or she does not roll again for a class specific item
until everyone has won a roll. That's fair. And the guild WILL grow.

Anyone have any comments regarding *experince groups* in a raid set up? How
equitable is that?
