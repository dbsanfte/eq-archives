Why is it important that the class be able to whore itself out in PoK?
Does this mean the warrior class is broken because they can't stand
around in PoK and make some money bandaging wounds or something?

And by the way, I do still sometimes get courtesy payments for SOW.

Nope, that's hard, really.  Group can't succeed without a cleric?
I suppose there are some encounters where that's true, but I've
yet to run into one; the druid will fill in just fine.  Or what's
that?  Your group has nobody with sow or selo's?  Or maybe needs
a decent DS?  Or a snare?  Or you're low on DPS and those druid
dots can come in handy; heck, druids can even add some DPS with
melee in a pinch.  Oh, and what's that, no ranger or bard, but it
would be really helpful to have some tracking?  And those melees
and hybrids who can't even Gate sure do appreciate having a quick
group-port back to PoK (or Nexus at lower levels) at the end of
the night.

Sure, there's nothing that requires a druid.  But whatever it is
you DO require, there's a damned good chance a druid can do it for
you.  The druid might not do it as well as a specialist would, but
unless you already have the perfect group you can always find
something for the druid to do.
