Yup, thats right - I wouldnt mind having a look at what its like.  I
just got a few newbie questions;

I live in the UK, and as I understand, EQ is a US game - how does this
affect connection speed and lag times?  I have got a 512k cable
connection, so it hopefully shouldnt be too bad.
Can I just buy the bog standard EQ game, and not have to worry about
buying any expansion packs (at the start, at least)?
Also, can other players kill your character?  I am after a co-operative
type game, rather than one where you get groups of player-killers going
round and splatting newbies.  I play Phantasy Star Online on the
Dreamcast alot, and the PK'ers have really managed to ruin it.  Do you
get people cheating at all?
What happens to your character if you die?  Is that it, and you have to
start again, or do you get warped back somewhere else, minus anything
you where carrying?

I used to play the board game version of AD&D with my mates, and it was
a right laugh - hopefully some of the fun can be re-created online...
Oh, and does the game work ok with WinXP Pro?  Cos thats what I am using
at the moment...
