Agreed.

The higher level you are, the less likely they will aggro.  But is that 
also turn with the way the consider to you?  Can't you still be KOS and not 
have aggro?  If that's true, then why were the skeletons conning 
indifferent to my cleric but KOS to the paladin?  The cleric was about 2 
lvls higher than the paladin - but that shouldn't matter to the con, but 
perhaps to the aggro.  So what's up with the con?
