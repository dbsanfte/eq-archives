So my mage, who I've been playing recently, never paid much attention to 
gear.  Didn't buy it, didn't work hard to loot it, just worked on 
leveling up.

Yesterday, though, I got the bug, and went to the bazaar to see what was 
available.

After hemming and hawing a bit, I found something that excited me; +mana 
regen items.

Astonishing whats available now.  Spending under 5kpp, I got +10 mana 
regen worth of items; my only item before that point was a solstice 
earring!  If I had another 20K or so to drop, I could take that up to 
+15 total without breaking a sweat.

Some of those items are probably no-drop on servers other than FV (I 
know the augments are, but I didn't invest in any of those yet, oddly 
they are more expensive than simple +mregen gear.)

So, at 65 with no AA investment, whats my total cap in mana regen?  I 
never really bothered researching that before, because gear wasn't 
really easily available with mana regen anyway, to a casual player.  But 
it looks like now I could get up there pretty fast.

Here's what I picked up:
Brilliant Mask: +1 mr
Spiritmaster War Beads: +2 mr
Cloak of the Fallen Priest: +2 mr
Chipped Ring of Bloodcalling: +2 mr
Gem of Conquest: +3 mr
Already had
Earring of the Solstice: +1 mr

Because of the generally crappy nature of the gear I was replacing, this 
also represented a substantial infusion of mana pool and hit points, and 
a bunch of other stats that matter a lot less to a mage.

I also bought a copy of the 63 fire pet, Child of Ro.  I know, probably 
a waste of pp, but it was on the block cheap, and I've heard rumors that 
the fire pet line isn't totally gimp now.  Sadly, I can't seem to find 
any discussion of this topic, probably just poor internet skills.  I 
took him out for a spin, and his spell casting choices didn't seem 
completely stupid, however going up against simple dark blue melee mob 
that I've been facing repeatedly with air pet, his performance was much 
worse; didn't seem to be any faster at killing the target, but lost hp 
much faster.  On the other hand, I recall that the key to fire pets was 
that they were really nice with a big fat hp buff; generally low hp 
totals, means they benefit more from the buff than the other pets.

What I'd really like to know is if their DPS is better, and what 
precisely their spell list is, because I seem to remember the old spell 
list meant they were really bad to have around in a group for reasons I 
can't recall.
