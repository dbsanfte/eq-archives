I'm simply using your label: 'rp' instead of inventing a new one. FWIW  No
self respecting "Roleplayer" thinks that simply boycotting the bazaar to
avoid self-twinking has *anything* to do with roleplaying.
By that logic someone who plays quake2 whos trying to finish the game with a
pistol because they prefer the challenge is a 'roleplayer'...

There are loads of roleplayers who are happy to shop the bazaar. On the
other hand there are some roleplayers who won't. But a lot of the people who
skip the bazaar have more in common with the guy playing quake2 with a
pistol then a 'roleplayer'.

Not at all. Many of these self-equipped players are happy to hunt Velious,
Luclin, etc. They aren't necessarily sticking to the old-world (though I'm
sure a few do). And your right, 30th level mobs in the expansions rotinely
drop better gear than 50th level old world mobs...

And many of these players are happy to purchase something that they know
drops off a green. They are trying to avoid using items they have no ability
to get; for the most part, they aren't sadists who'll let the quest item
they're looking for rot because a different group found one after he'd
personally dropped 20 spawns that 'could' have dropped it.

In the old days you could still self twink in gfay or ec or nfreeport... it
just took a little longer and the selection wasn't as good. There were
'so-called' rp players back then too boycotting that... the bazaar is a
non-issue... it simply removed a pointless timesink for those who want to
use the player economy.

touche... but I don't think either us want to cater to the jerks.
