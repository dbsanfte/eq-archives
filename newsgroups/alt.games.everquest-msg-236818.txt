Aye, the framerate hit here is hideous. I run a P4EE with 1.5g of PC3500,
striped raptor SATAs and a 9800XT and I find it taxing with my usual
settings. Not enough to diminish the experience appreciably, but noticable.
I'm with David and 42, I think they were anticipating releasing this with
Tunare 3.0 and probably developed and tested it with that engine. Hopefully,
it's not far behind.

As noticable as it is, it doesn't come close in my experience to the Bazaar,
where I still wind up having to stare at walls or alter my settings in order
to function. Barindu is worse than Bazaar for you?
