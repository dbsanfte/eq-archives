For broad definitions of "derived."  It seems like a clear example of 
legislation from the bench.  In the decision, they referenced the precedent 
of Lloyd Corporation v. Whiffen.  The problem is that precedent is not law. 
If the case you refer to is flawed then your decision will be equally 
flawed.  If you treat precedent as equal to law, then what you are actually 
doing is allowing legislation to occur by decision of judges - who are often 
not accountable to the people they "serve."

From the decision you cited:

] But we do not confront the issue as a matter of first impression. In
] Lloyd Corporation v. Whiffen, 315 Or 500, 849 P2d 446 (1993), the
] Oregon Supreme Court found a right to gather initiative petition
] signatures on at least some private property to be "implicit" in the
] initiative provisions of Article IV, section 1. According to the court,
] because access to people is "the life blood" of the initiative power,
] the constitution must be read to permit the solicitation of initiative
] petition signatures at some locations that happen to be private
] property, subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions.
] Id. at 511-13. Regardless of what the text of the constitution or its
] enactment might reveal, therefore, we must take it as given that the
] right to solicit initiative petition signatures exists. The only
] question properly before us is the scope of that right.

And the referenced section of the Oregon Constitution:

 ] (1) The legislative power of the state, except for the initiative and
] referendum powers reserved to the people, is vested in a Legislative
] Assembly, consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives.

It is clear that the Constitution does not say what the OSC claimed it did. 
It's more "penumbras" of the constitution.  There is nothing in Art IV, Sect 
1 that even remotely implies what the OSC claims.  That part was invented, 
whole cloth, by the OSC.  What I find as especially hideous is the line 
"Regardless of what the text of the constitution or its enactment might 
reveal, therefore, we must take it as given that the right to solicit 
initiative petition signatures exists."  They pretty much specifically say 
"the actual Constitution be damned, we're going to keep right on making the 
same mistake that our predecessors made."

Then, by your estimation, the court can interpret the law to say whatever it 
pleases (and, if they can pull that decision out of Art IV, Sect 1, you 
can't say that's not the case).  At that point, we are no longer a nation of 
laws, nor does it matter who we elect, since the judges can "interpret" 
things however they see fit, and the US becomes an oligarchy of judges.

The purpose of the constitution is to create clear and strong limits to the 
government and to bind it as our servant, not to make us its.  We exist as a 
people with God-given rights (or, rights inherent in our existance as 
humans, if you prefer) with a govenrment that has no rights, but is given 
certain specific privileges by the constitution.

] "Did you really think that we want those laws to be observed?"
] said Dr. Ferris. "We *want* them broken. You'd better get it straight
] That it's not a bunch of boy scouts you're up against- then you'll

] anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed
] nor enforced nor objectively interpreted - and you create a nation of
] law-breakers - and then you cash in on guilt. Now that's the system,
] Mr. Rearden, that's the game, and once you understand it, you'll be
