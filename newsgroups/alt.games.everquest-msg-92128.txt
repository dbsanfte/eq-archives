Monks from around your level to mid-50s can't really go
wrong in SolB, if you're good at soloing. The haste won't
make a huge difference, but let's take a look at your setup:

Level 43 Monk
1. Old Haste: Chitin Hand Wraps, 22% Haste

Primary?: Goranga Spiked Club, 1HB, 12/23
Old Haste Adjusted Delay: 19
Main Hand Damage Bonus: (Level-25)/3 = 6
Modal: (Weapon Damage)*2+Bonus = 30
Modal Over Time: Modal/Delay = 1.579
RealDPS: Accuracy*Modal Over Time*10*(Double Attack)
       = 0.6     *1.579          *10*(1.506)
       = 14.268
(Assuming you've maxed Double Attack and you are fighting
Blue to Yellow mobs. Also, Modal isn't really average damage
[since you have Max Hits], but it's close.)

Secondary?: Wu's Trance Stick, 1HB, 7/18
Old Haste Adjusted Delay: 15
Modal: (Weapon Damage)*2 = 14
Modal Over Time: Modal/Delay = 0.933
RealDPS: Accuracy*Modal Over Time*10*DA*(Dual Wield)
       = 0.6     *0.933          *10*(1.506)*(0.737)
       = 6.213
(Assuming you've maxed Double Attack and Dual Wield and you
are fighting Blue to Yellow mobs. Also, Modal isn't really
average damage [since you have Max Hits], but it's close.)

So we would expect if you parsed your current total DPS (not
including Weapon Procs, Flying Kicks and other special
combat abilities) it would come out around:
Mainhand RealDPS + Offhand RealDPS = 20.481

************************************************
Now to recalc with your borrowed haste item.

2. New Haste: Cloak of Crystaline Waters, 36% Haste

Primary?: Goranga Spiked Club, 1HB, 12/23
New Haste Adjusted Delay: 17
Main Hand Damage Bonus: (Level-25)/3 = 6
Modal: (Weapon Damage)*2+Bonus = 30
Modal Over Time: Modal/Delay = 1.765
RealDPS: Accuracy*Modal Over Time*10*(Double Attack)
       = 0.6     *1.765          *10*(1.506)
       = 15.948
(Assuming you've maxed Double Attack and you are fighting
Blue to Yellow mobs. Also, Modal isn't really average damage
[since you have Max Hits], but it's close.)

Secondary?: Wu's Trance Stick, 1HB, 7/18
New Haste Adjusted Delay: 13
Modal: (Weapon Damage)*2 = 14
Modal Over Time: Modal/Delay = 1.077
RealDPS: Accuracy*Modal Over Time*10*DA*(Dual Wield)
       = 0.6     *1.077          *10*(1.506)*(0.737)
       = 7.172
(Assuming you've maxed Double Attack and Dual Wield and you
are fighting Blue to Yellow mobs. Also, Modal isn't really
average damage [since you have Max Hits], but it's close.)

Your new combined DPS (again not including Weapon Procs,
Flying Kicks and other special combat abilities) would be:
23.12.

So, to answer thoroughly (assuming I haven't made any
errors) your DPS should increase by around 2.639. So if your
average fight lasts a minute, you will be doing 158
additional points of damage.
