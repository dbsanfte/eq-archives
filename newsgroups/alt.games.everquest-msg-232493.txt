We've had different discussions about clarity and kei.  I was told that KEI
only works while you are sitting (and / or on a horse), not while you are
standing.

Is this true?  If I'm soloing as a shaman, and fighting along with my pet,
then am I not getting any benefit out of KEI except when I sit between
fights?

Usually I don't sit too much because I am canni dancing.  Am I being counter
productive by getting KEI and the Canni Dancing?  Do they cancel each other
out?

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated,
