I just logged in to the Bazaar on Povar...360 in the zone.  Got dropped to
the desktop 6 times because of the lag.  But I did manage to spend all the
plat I had on some cool items I never even knew existed <g>.  Prices are
waaaaay low in the Bazaar.  The search feature is excellent as is the
merchant tracking.
