Well, the WoW beta is closed and now I'm left with a weekend to fill with
EQ2.  I was fairly impressed with WoW, since I haven't played a MMoRPG since
EQ1- and yet I wasn't too troubled when I read that the open beta was
closed, and deleted the beta off the hard drive.  Actually, I'm not that
inclined to purchase and play the retail version of WoW.

I am interested in EQ2, and I'll go back and read up on the discussion both
here and on the various websites (which would you recommend?).  I'm trying
to think of what I didn't like about WoW so I can compare against EQ2 but
there really wasn't anything not to like, other than the way everything is
sugar coated and baby-fed to you (the player).  I guess I was in awe of the
scenery when I first started, but as I created other characters I felt this
motherly hand walking (running?) me from area to area and showing me.  Maybe
it was a lack of danger?  Or, maybe I'm just getting old and find it hard to
give in to that particular fantasy world where it's "oh look, here's a
'tiger level 2', I can kill this... and over there is 'tiger level 4'... and
over there is 'tiger level 6'... and so on".  Now, I imagine the PvP aspect
will make all the hand holding and gentle prodding along worth it, in the
long run, but here I am, married, father of a few, just looking to take up
an hour or so after a long day of work, or being lazy on the weekend... how
can I defend against younger, lazyer (heh), way more experienced players?
I've learned over many years that, I can't.  So what's in EQ2 for me?  I am
willing to assume that I'm not the target audience, and really should just
stick to my real life adventures (I fear diaper rash and strep throat much
more than any lvl ?? beastie).

Well, if you've read this far I have one more question about EQ2 and my PC.
I have a P4 3.0ghz, 1gig ram, and an ATI 9200 video card.  I guess that's
meaty enough for EQ2, but figured I'd write it out for someone with
experience to give me the a-ok.

Thanks for reading and answering...

offend anyone, as it didn't occure to me to simply post this here, since 
I've never been here)
