Pretty early.   It was put in while I was playing my first character, (well,
the first I kept) and he must have been in the teens or twenty at highest.
So that would put it at around June or July of '99.

Bah.  Casters Realm's patch archive only goes back to September 99, or I
could tell you when.    And a quick search of Google shows that we weren't
quite as reliable about posting a copy of the patch message while the server
was down back then.

I seem to remember it being right around the time when they changed
fletching from creating one arrow at a time to 5 arrows per combine.  But
that could be my faulty memory.
