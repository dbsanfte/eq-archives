Great spot to go as a DE necro would be to fearkite solo just outside the
outpost in The Overthere.  You can med right next to the golum out the east
gate and just pull various creatures near the fort and fear kite em to
death.  Make sure you go out the east gate though, the ones out the south
gate are more appropriate for the mid 30's.
