I have a level 9 warrior twink with nearly 2500 *unbuffed* hp.  That's about
10 times higher than the average level 9 warrior.

Sometimes I wonder if Loral and I are playing the same game.

No doubt.  One requires raiding.  And not just raiding, but a coordinated
progression of 50+ people through at least a couple complete iterations of
full sets of equipment.  You can't take 50 people in bazaar bought gear and
take out the hardest mob in the game.  You could take them to Time and spend
a month or three gearing up, and then have a *slight* chance.  Of course the
more logical thing to do is to then start gearing up through GoD raid
encounters for your third iteration of equipment, and then work your way up
through OoW raid encounters for your fourth iteration in equipment,
culminating in actually being able to acquire that piece you posted for a
single player, with the promise to go back and do the fight until everyone
that wants that item has acquired it, a fight that can be lost if any single
one of those 50 people gets disconnected, distracted, or simply doesn't
respond to the event fast enough.

I can 3-box the other item.

No, really, there aren't.  There are some areas where you would *like* them
to be compared in irrational and downright silly ways, but the fact of the
matter is I can 3-box one of the items over the course of a few days and the
other takes a year of solid raiding for 50+ people, at *least*, to acquire.

Again, I wonder if we play the same game.  Every, every, *every* raider I
know has multiple DoN vendor purchased augments (or could use some).

Of course, I also know *lots* of raiders that raid all the time, and very
seldom group at all.  The last time *I* was in a "group" was...  hell, I
can't remember.

And to actually be fair, that single-group encounter must require the group
to spend a year acquiring the other single-group equipment that will allow
them to have a chance to beat it, do multiple lengthy quests and loot-less,
time-consuming, death count inducing single-group encounters to get the
proper flags to be able to even touch that single-group encounter.

And then rinse and repeat for the other 5 people whose breastplates all drop
in *other* flagged zones with their own lengthy quests and loot-less,
time-consuming, death count inducing single-group encounters to get the
proper flags to be able to get to those encounters.   =P

Until people wise up and realize that it isn't a "problem" and doesn't need
"fixed".  Too bad people would rather whine out of their sense of
entitlement than actually think things through.
