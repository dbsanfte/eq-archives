    Actually, Everquest is one of the most mentally stimulating forms of
entertainment I've ever run into.

    I'd put it up equal with reading and perhaps even second only to GMing a
roleplaying game off the top of your head. (Want a mental exercise? Try
that.)

    It teaches teamwork, the importance of *efficient* communication, stops
just shy of enforcing tactical analysis and allows us filthy nerds to make
virtual friends.

    It got Dark Tyger a GF for pete's sake. That's gotta be worth something!

    It's also the cheapest hour-for-hour entertainment I've ever come
across. Even roleplaying costs more (mountain dew and pizza don't come
cheap). As an entertainment, EQ kicks so much butt its feet stink.

    As an addiction, it's not that bad either. It appears to be a harder
habit to kick than Heroin, but certainly cheaper and with a much lower
mortality rate. I'd put it ahead of Alcohol too - mostly due to cost, and
it's streets ahead of Cannibis.

    Best of all, no drooling-fuckwit bunch of militant pro-lifer hippie
morons with "Land Rights for Gay Whales" t-shirts has managed to make it
illegal yet.

    And remember, drugs are bad, don't turn to drugs to solve your
problems - see your psychiatrist for some happy pills!

Cheers,
James
