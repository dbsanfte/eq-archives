I just picked up DAoC....and put it back down about 3 weeks later. I 
didn't realize they were revamping the player models. They do suck much 
right now, but updated models won't make it worth it to me.

Well enough, I suppose. I'm not expert, but it seemed pretty apparent to 
me that the game it geared heavily toward PvP. It's not my cup of tea. 
PvE is there, but felt very, very much like an afterthought to me.

I'll have to give it a very low score here as well. It didn't seem to me 
that there were all that many different armor/weapon graphics, but I 
didn't play long enough to see too much, I suppose.

Maybe. I didn't stick around long enough to get a frame of reference.

Another thing that struck me was the fact that, to me, many aspects of 
the game just seemed rather cheaply done. For instance, the hunter class 
I created got an ability to summon a wolf pet. When using this ability 
for the first time, I was startled by the incredibly inappropriate sound 
effect that accompanied it. It was a harsh "clang" sound. It honestly 
just came across as a very cheap sound effect.

This is my 2cp worth. YMMV.
