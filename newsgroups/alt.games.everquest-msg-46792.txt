> curious, what is the trivial loot code?

It is a ruleset that causes special loot to vaporize if any party
member is of a suffiently high level to NOT receive experience from
the kill. It applies to no-drop, magic, and lore loot only. Normal
loot will drop regardless of TLC. You know that it's affected you if
you get the message "Weak_Green_01 was a trivial challenge for your
party."

On production servers, there are only two zones that have TLC. The
Warrens and Stonebrunt Mountains. Verant recently decided to NOT put
TLC into Shadows of Luclin.

On test servers, Firiona Vie is the first server to have TLC installed
in EVERY zone. However, as compensation, there are supposedly very few
no-drop items on the FV server. If the rumors of bumping everyone on
that server to level 25 are true, then I'd imagine that one of the
things they want to test is how such a change will affect whatever
economy develops on that server. It should be interesting.

As for the "stupid questions" response, I'd say that this topic is so
widely misunderstood that it's anything but a stupid question. Some
people should learn a little tolerance before posting scathing
responses.
