: Shaman tells the group, 'The an Uglymob has been slowed!'

Chanters cans low too and sometimes I met chanters not knowing, that
adding a shaman basically means slow is being taken care of. On large
raids I in generallike what happens to supermobs, but that's a matter of
taste I guess.

What I really hate is melee people starting to send out annoying
tells, because they don't get buffs early. Doesn't occur to them that
shamen, chanters etc are casting madly at 50 people with 10 second spells
just because they as a warrior have nothing else to do than stand around :)
Annoys me much mroe than a few battle messages.
