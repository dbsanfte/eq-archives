I think it would be very neat if there existed a combat zone designed 
just for little races, fully of short passageways. and the tallest 
ceilings not much higher than a dwarven head.  Only gnomes, halflings, 
and dwarves could "teleport" in because a wood elves head would 
instantly be frozen in the rocky ceiling above.  The mobs would have a 
wide range of levels so shorties could hunt in there much of their 
lives.  Just something to give those tall cretins some shortness-envy, 
hehe.
