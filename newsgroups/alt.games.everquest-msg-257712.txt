Not terribly irrelevant.  While I do pack my own haste if needed, if I
didn't have the monk epic in my bag and available I wouldn't be joining
many groups with no haste available.  Same theory.  No desire to
intentionally and unnecessarily cripple myself.

Even after the first time the cleric gets the beat down?  I've never had any
issues with heal aggro outside of a raid, and that's with healing my sorry
no-taunt, monk-tank self.  But I was responding to you saying it would be
the major concern at that point.  =)

It didn't have any chance of going anywhere useful from the first post.  =)
I almost commented on how the fellow should warn others of his poor
equipment level in my first response, but then I realized he hadn't actually
mentioned anything about equipment (and in a later post showed that he was
wearing what would be considered "supertwink" gear).  Thus making his
comments about wanting to learn strategy in this manner amusing at best. 
Once you're twinked (as all my characters are these days), don't do it
half-assed.
