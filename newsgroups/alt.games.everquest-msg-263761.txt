Yeah, they both have server side lag. The big difference, however, is that 
EQ2's is improving week to week. Not surprising as the SOE team has quite 
bit more experience writing MMOG server side code and the WoW team has none. 
So the expectation is really higher for the EQ2 team, they really should 
know how to do this by now.
