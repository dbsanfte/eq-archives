Glad you think so but, erm, what you doing in an EQ ng?

DAoC is 10x better coded but I certainly wouldn't say it was a better
game...It *is* a different game so if you couldn't get on with EQ but still
like the idea of MMORPG's then it is the next one I would recommend...I
didn't get on with it so came back to EQ.
