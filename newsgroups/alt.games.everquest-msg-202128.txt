I normally solo with my beastlord but a good friend of mine has her Necro up
to 41 now and we were thinking about grouping together.  Just looking for
some suggestions for a place to go.  I tend to like places that are off the
beaten path and not normally seen by most people.  Fun is my first priority,
then decent xp and loot being a very small concern.  Would like something
that is somewhat challenging, but not instant death.

Thanks for any ideas.
