The 'question' comprised the first line of a 3 paragraph post. I was
responding to other parts of the post. You state that:

>This is useful if you're in the Bazaar as a vendor, and need
>some automated process done while you're AFK, such as recording a TV
>show with your capture card.

and with EQW you would be able to run your PCVideo without having to
shut down EQ. Then you go on with false assumptions such as:

>I'd bet there isn't a card out there which can run EQ (or any DirectX
>3D game), especially in the Bazaar, or any Luclin zones while capturing
>MPEG2 or even MPEG1 video or even low compression AVI video all at the
>same time.

and with EQW, I believe it would be trivially easy. Haven't tried video
capture specifically, but with amd1800, 512mb ram and GF3 Ti500 I've
seen run 3 simultaneous sessions of EQ, in bazaar, full luclin models
(but clip plane down) and still bring up an mpeg player. No pyrotechnics
from the video card either.

Don't take this as a flame, but how about thinking of other ways to
acheive the end goal, rather than the clumsy one of forcing EQ to crash.
You cite your reasons for wanting to crash out of EQ as being to run
other programs that you couldn't otherwise run with EQ fullscreened. I
offered you a way of running those applications, totally removing the
need to shut EQ down in the first place.

The answer your original question to the letter:

HIGH TECH ANSWER
Code a small program to end the eqgame.exe task

LOW TECH ANSWER
Set up a weight above your 1 key. Balance weight with a bucket of sand
with a small hole in. When enough sand has fallen out of the bucket, the
wieght falls onto your 1 key, hitting a hotkey:
/sit
/camp desktop

EVEN EASIER ANSWER
Setup a hotkey:
/pause 12345
/sit
/camp desktop
where 12345 is a delay of how long before you want to exit eq.

Course, those are all probably WRONG too because they don't specifically
mess around with forcing EQ to crash by manipulating alt-tab. If you
really want to do that and risk any of the problems with a hard crash in
EQ, then I can't help you, sorry
