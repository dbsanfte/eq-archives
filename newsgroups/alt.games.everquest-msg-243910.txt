/sigh Ya know, I see now where miscommunicated or misinterpreted 
attitudes might be the source of this mess, but that doesn't seem to be 
what it's about now. There has been an awful lot of effort put into 
discounting a stance I never claimed to defend in the first place.

Honestly though, I shouldn't have taken such offense to your initial 
response. For that and other disparaging remarks up to which it lead I 
apologize. It didn't do anything to promote the discussion I was trying 
to cultivate.
