Commitment to what?  Commitment to be online ready to raid 30 hours
a week and do xp "on your own time"?  Commitment to forgo your own
enjoyment of the game for weeks or months on end because you happen
to be one of the very few in position to help others get through PoJ
trials?

Or commitment to treat one another with respect, to not sully the good
name of the guild, and to help one another out on occasion?  There is
an enormous difference between the mentality of raiding guilds and that
of social or family-style guilds that you are simply ignoring.  There
is a huge range in people's willingness to subordinate themselves to
group interests in a leisure activity.  And your claim that a guild of
enthusiastic followers is better than an association of like-minded
individualists in that context is completely absurd.  And since there
are a LOT of EQ players who are unwilling to accept your definition of
"good", SOE has doubtless been getting a LOT of negative feedback about
the trials.  And so, like every other non-essential that's unpopular
with a substantial number of customers, the trials are being killed.

If the trials led directly to places like Veeshan's Peaks or Sleeper's
Tomb (i.e. raid-only zones) there would be no issue here.  If the trials
led to zones that were only incrementally better in exp and loot than
those otherwise available there wouldn't be much of an issue here.  But
as things are (for one more day anyway), all evidence points to the PoJ
trials being a failure in the most important quality of any social game
like EQ:  they were at the root of the stress that wrecked many in-game
relationships, thus making the game a lot less fun for many players.

And, as of tomorrow, as Ed pointed out, "It's dead, Jim".
