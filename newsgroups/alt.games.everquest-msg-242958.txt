I have been home from work since roughly 6 pm est trying off and on to get
in. The last update on the login server problem on Everquest's site was at
3:30 pm. What gives guys? I see by the postings here that not many are
having any luck logging in if any! They need to wake up and smell the roses.
I am paying $40 for 3 months to play this game. This isn't Warcraft and
Battlenet that you can play for free! You think Sony will give you credit
for days you can't play? NO of course not!!!..There I griped and got it off
my chest..I feel better NOT
