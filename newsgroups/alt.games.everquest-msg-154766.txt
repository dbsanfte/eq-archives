But taking away what wizards do best (nuke for gold) is like removing the
wizard class primary ability in the game they designed!?
It's like nerfing warriors so they cant wear plate armor. Its an essential
to the class.
Sure nerfing warriors so they cant wear plate armor will make MOBs more
challenging, but is this really what we want?

I seriously think they should give wizards ability to some DoT line spells
after these nerfs.
