Not at all, but I am just suggesting he may like to follow the generally
accepted ettique that poeple add the [OT] tag when posting stuff that is,
well OT.

I just think that the last thing this NG needs is more crap posted about
racism. This NG has a fair share of flaming and abuse when just discussing
mundane EQ matters, so why add more fuel to that? or do you live for
confrontation and abuse? If poeple want to argue the pros and cons of racism
there are many forums for it, i just dont think this is it.
