Quoting that thing you agree to every time you play:

"We may terminate this Agreement (including ... your Account)
immediately and without notice ... upon gameplay, chat or any
player activity whatsoever which is, in our sole discretion,
inappropriate..."

That's commonly known as a "We reserve the right to refuse
service to anyone at our discretion" clause and is, surprisingly
enough, perfectly legal.   Unless you can prove they violated
your civil rights -- and you have NO right to free speech on
someone else's computer systems -- you're SOL if they ban
you.   And you're pretty much SOL getting anyone to help you
regain access to an online computer game anyway.
