Warden just runs under WOW, and doesnt need to be uninstalled when ive 
finished. The sony software not only contunues to run consuming cpu 
resources, but has no way of being uninstalled (unless youre in the .1% of 
people who can remove it manually).

To be harsh on blizzard, were comparing spyware with malware, which is an 
order of magnitude worse.
