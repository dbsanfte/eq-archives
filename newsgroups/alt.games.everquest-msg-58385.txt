This item doesn't have a range, or any kind of damage/delay, so it
won't be thrown if you accidentally hit your range attack.

Darn good thing too for an item like this, I can remember being a
lowbie dwarf, and having been given a mighty 8/30 hammer that had a
range on it, and let you equip it in the range slot.  Honest, the
merchants offered me 5pp for it!! (aah, those were the days, when 5pp
meant a lot to me :)  I thought I'd try chucking it at some spider,
and whamo, missed.  I dispatched the spider and looted him expecting
to find my valuable hammer, but nada.  Looked around on the ground,
and couldn't find it anywhere.  Hard lesson for me to learn, wish I
had just sold it.  I was pretty livid.
