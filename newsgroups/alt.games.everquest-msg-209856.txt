Do you have any concept how much 24/7/365 availability costs? A lot.
Yes, it does matter how much you pay. Your $1 a month barely scratches
the surface of what it is likely costing him to run this. Just the
connection alone is likely running him $300+/month, not to mention
hardware, not to mention his time, not to mention the development costs.
He isn't running this to make a profit, and I'm damned sure this isn't
his day job.

I doubt they even employ themselves, let alone anyone else. You seem to
be under the impression they are a business and are making a profit. I'm
willing to bet that at $12ish a year, they are barely breaking even of
bandwidth and hosting costs, and maybe the hardware itself. Unless you
want to volunteer to give up your job to do this for free as an
employee?
